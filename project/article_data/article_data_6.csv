In Pa. Senate run, Dr. Oz casts self as pro-Second Amendment, but he has backed gun-control measures
","In his run for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania, Dr. Mehmet Oz is branding himself as a protector of rights for gun owners.  So it might be surprising to GOP voters to see claims from his  chief rival for the Republican nomination that say he’s made numerous statements in support of gun-control measures. Former hedge fund CEO Dave McCormick used a  15-second video ad on Facebook and Instagram to describe Oz, the physician and TV personality who is endorsed by former President Donald Trump.  ""Mehmet Oz is anti-gun,"" the ad claims in text that appears over a grainy black-and-white image of Oz while dramatic music plays and other claims flash across the screen. ""Oz called for a New Zealand-style gun ban,"" says one. ""Oz: Americans should have ‘less access to guns.’""  Did Oz really say those things? A review of statements he has made on television, in social media posts and in bylined columns show Oz for years promoted these and other ideas supported by advocates of gun control measures. His position on these matters appears to have changed since he announced his plan to run for public office. The ""Second Amendment"" section of Oz’s campaign website says:  ""As a proud gun-owner, Dr. Oz is a firm believer in the Second Amendment and our constitutional right to bear arms for protection. He opposes anti-gun measures like red flag laws and liberal gun grabs … every law-abiding American citizen should be allowed to buy the gun of their desire."" But in nationally circulated newspaper columns that Oz co-wrote with Dr. Michael Roizen — and that Oz has recently distanced himself from — Oz frequently endorsed gun control stances. Oz’s campaign did not reply to our requests for information.  In 2019, Oz indicated support for a gun ban like one in New Zealand. That year, New Zealand banned most semiautomatic weapons following a terror attack on two mosques that left 51 people dead.  Oz was the lead author of a question-and-answer syndicated newspaper column that he wrote with Roizen. In a 2019 column that called gun deaths in America a public health crisis, the doctors suggested the United States reinstitute a ban on assault rifles.  The column ended by saying the New Zealand parliament passed legislation banning most semi-automatic and military-style weapons with a hope ""to get as many of these assault weapons off their streets ASAP. Can we?"" Oz once said Americans should have less access to guns — but he did not state support for any specific gun control measure. In a 2013 column about America’s overall health ranking, Oz and his colleague cited a number of health problems and noted the number of gun-related homicides in the U.S. They offered dietary tips and other health suggestions. ""And let's add in more access to health care; less access to guns that aren't designed for hunting; more access to good nutrition"" and other steps, they wrote. They did not elaborate on how to achieve ""less access"" to guns. McCormick’s campaign cited to us additional Oz statements on gun control that are not noted in the ad. Background checks: In a 2014 column, Oz and his colleague  wrote that ""until the government embraces gun-safety measures — polls show that 79% of the population favors universal background checks for gun buyers — it's every doctor's responsibility to their patients and your responsibility to yourself and your family to reduce gun violence."" Waiting periods: In a 2017 column, the doctors wrote: ""One regulation that seems to be very effective in reducing gun violence, and shouldn’t bother anyone, is to institute waiting periods in every state. … Just think how many lives strict background checks and tighter automatic weapon, magazine and ammunition regulations could save without impinging on anyone’s rights."" Stricter regulation: Oz and his colleague expressed support in a 2018 column for ""responsible gun laws"" to reduce gun deaths among children. They said there are twice as many pediatric firearm deaths in states with the ""most lenient"" gun regulations than in states with the strictest regulations. The column also urged readers who support stricter regulations to write to their representatives.   Study gun violence: Also in 2018, Oz tweeted in reference to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention: ""Right now, the @CDCgov is NOT funded to study gun violence in this country. It’s time we treat shootings as a public health problem. Contact your congressperson today to demand they fund the #CDC to comprehensively study gun violence. #EndTheBan."" Red-flag laws: On his TV show in 2019, Oz said red flag laws, which provide a mechanism to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others, ""may help protect you and your family."" At a campaign stop in February 2022, Oz said he believes in some red flag-style laws to evaluate whether people with certain mental health issues should be allowed to be armed, but that he is against any national red-flag registry, according to a local news report of the event.  On March 18, 2022, in a story about the columns supporting gun-control measures, Fox News reported that Oz disavowed the columns. In an interview, Roizen told PolitiFact that for most of the more than 15 years that he and Oz co-authored the column, he and Oz typically wrote the columns separately, without consulting one another. Roizen said he believes he wrote all of the columns that supported gun-control measures.  ""I believe he believed in people having guns, the Second Amendment,"" Roizen said, but that he didn’t know Oz’s opinions on any gun-control measures. He said Oz never expressed any objections to him about the columns that supported gun control. ""I don’t remember any conversation about it at all,"" Roizen said. The Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and decided not to seek re-election.  Besides McCormick and Oz, the major Republican candidates are commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate developer Jeff Bartos, Philadelphia attorney George Bochetto and Carla Sands, who served as Trump's ambassador to Denmark.  The Real Clear Politics polling average as of April 12 shows McCormick in the lead by 2.6 percentage points over Oz. An Emerson College Polling/The Hill poll of very likely Republican Pennsylvania voters conducted April 3-4 showed McCormick in the lead, by 18% to 17%, over Oz. Trump endorsed Oz on April 9, five days after McCormick’s ad started running. Trump said Oz ""will always fight for and support our under-siege Second Amendment."" The leading Democratic candidates are Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta and U.S. Rep.  Conor Lamb. The primaries are May 17. Overall, the Nov. 8 general election race is rated as a toss-up and as ""tilts Republican."" The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, now split 50-50. McCormick said in an ad that Oz ""called for a New Zealand-style gun ban"" and said ""Americans should have less access to guns."" Oz currently is running as a pro-gun candidate, but that is in contrast with statements he made for years in support of gun-control measures such as an assault rifle ban and measures to restrict gun purchases, such as background checks and waiting periods.  Oz’s statement about less access to guns was vague; it did not call for governmental restrictions on gun access. We rate the statement Mostly True.

McDonald’s didn’t add xylitol, a sugar alcohol toxic to dogs, to its soft serve ice cream
","We’re not sure who is thinking about feeding McDonald’s ice cream to their dogs. But in case you know someone who is, a social media post offers this urgent, exclamation-point-filled message: ""WARNING!!! McDonald’s has added Xylitol to their ice cream!!! Xylitol is deadly to dogs!! Do not let your pups eat any type of ice cream from McDonald’s!!"" reads an April 13 Facebook post. But dog owners don’t have to worry too much — it isn’t true. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Xylitol, a sugar alcohol, can be deadly to dogs, but we could find no evidence that it was added to McDonald’s ice cream recipe. It isn’t listed as an ingredient in any of the company’s desserts. McDonald’s also dismissed the rumor. ""These claims are false,"" the company said in an email to PolitiFact. ""Our soft serve, found in our cones and other desserts, does not contain xylitol."" This doesn’t mean that regularly giving your dog ice cream is a good idea, however. Pet companies and veterinarians warn that too much can make dogs sick, and some ice cream companies do include toxic ingredients, like xylitol.  Even so, it’s not in McDonald’s ice cream, so we rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809784D740>],/factchecks/2022/apr/14/facebook-posts/mcdonalds-didnt-add-xylitol-sugar-alcohol-toxic-do/

No, the Brooklyn subway shooting was not a false flag attack
","Hours after a gunman opened fire on a crowded subway train during morning rush hour in Brooklyn, New York, some people logged onto social media to falsely claim that the attack was staged, or what many call a ""false flag"" operation.  ""Biden gives a gun grabbing speech yesterday, when NO ONE was talking about guns, and voila! FALSE FLAG,"" someone tweeted, sharing a story about the shooting. ""The guy fired 33 rounds in a crowded subway car and hit 10 people. No deaths, and the cameras just HAPPENED to not be functioning, and the guy ‘got away’. This has EVERY marking of a False Flag,"" another said.  Other reasons social media users used to claim that the attack was fake include bogus claims of crisis actors and ""fake blood."" ""False flags"" are supposed covert operations designed to deflect blame and are frequently the subject of conspiracy theories. Posts making these claims were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) On April 12, a man popped open a smoke canister in a subway car and started shooting, firing over 30 rounds and striking 10 people as the train pulled into the 36th Street station in Sunset Park. Five riders were critically wounded in the rush-hour attack, and many more were injured in the chaos that followed, police said. No deaths have been reported. Wearing a gas mask and construction vest, the man — identified by law enforcement as 62-year-old Frank R. James — fled the scene, leaving behind a gun, ammo, gasoline and fireworks. He was arrested a day later in Manhattan. While a motive has not yet been established, investigators said that James will face federal terrorism charges. There is no evidence that the attack was staged.  Multiple local and national news organizations have been closely covering the shooting in Brooklyn, obtaining live footage, speaking to law enforcement and interviewing witnesses. Claims about ""fake blood"" and ""crisis actors"" are baseless and appear to solely come from unsourced social media posts.  Cameras not working in the New York City subway system isn’t evidence of a conspiracy — it reflects long-standing issues plaguing the Metropolitan Transportation Authority that include frequent breakdowns and mechanical failures. The day before the shooting, President Joe Biden did announce new measures to crack down on so-called ""ghost guns,"" firearms that come in parts that can be bought online and assembled without much of a trace.  But the new rule, which essentially expands the definition of a firearm to cover these kits, is unrelated to the shooting. The firearm used in the attack wasn’t a ghost gun. Police said James purchased it from a federal firearms licensee in Ohio in 2012. While James had multiple arrests dating back to the 1990s, he has no felony convictions, law enforcement said, allowing him to make the purchase. New York law enforcement also debunked reports that said the FBI had previously investigated James and cleared him (a narrative many use to support false flag theories) saying in an April 13 news conference following James’ arrest that there is ""no record"" of any FBI investigation involving James and that claims stating otherwise are inaccurate.  It’s become common after a mass shooting to hear false claims that they were staged. This happens, partly, because these false beliefs often affirm people’s worldviews, researchers have told PolitiFact. When something tragic happens that seems to challenge one’s belief systems, it can be more comfortable to think that event was all staged for nefarious purposes. Distrust in the media and police also help push these hoaxes along and makes people more susceptible to believe in elaborate set-ups. ""It can be a lot more emotionally comfortable to believe that not only did it not happen, but that the thing that happened is actually a conspiracy to delegitimize your beliefs,"" said Mike Caulfield, a research scientist at the Center for an Informed Public at the University of Washington. One way people can confront false flag claims during chaotic events is to first ask themselves if they or the people posting these conspiracy theories are experts in crises, Caulfield said, and instead of jumping to conclusions, seek out experts and credible sources first. Social media posts claim that the mass shooting in the New York City subway was a false flag. This is baseless and relies on unsourced social media posts. The attack was real. Pants on Fire!

Pump the brakes: no law stipulating that drivers can’t go 5 miles over limit in North Carolina
","A Facebook post warned North Carolinians to be aware of a new speed limit law. ""Just passed into law today: You cannot go five miles over speed limit in NC,"" the post read. ""You can be stopped for one mile over posted speed limit!""  But pump the brakes — a majority of the Facebook users who responded to the post called it out for being misleading. ""Way to share improper information,"" wrote one user. ""It is not a law, because the law already says you can’t speed.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  First it’s important to note: the North Carolina Legislature isn’t scheduled to convene until May 4, so there wouldn’t have been a law passed at this time. There is an annual campaign underway from the Governor’s Highway Safety Program called ""Speed a Little, Lose a Lot,"" aimed at curbing fast driving and raising awareness of the risks of speeding past the limit. ""Law enforcement officers will step up enforcement of speeding motorists from April 11-17,"" a recent press release said.  But the campaign doesn’t say anything about a new law that bars drivers from going 5 mph over the speed limit. Lauren Horsch, spokeswoman for state Senator Phil Berger, confirmed this. ""Law enforcement has the authority to enforce speed limits, and enforcement decisions, like traffic stops, are within the discretion of the officer,"" Horsch said.  First Sgt. Christopher Knox of the North Carolina Department of Public Safety also debunked the claim. ""There has NOT been a change to North Carolina law with regards to speeding statutes, nor has there been any changes to our agencies enforcement of these laws,"" he wrote to PolitiFact. ""The North Carolina State Highway Patrol issues citations or makes arrests only for definite, clear-cut and substantial violations of the law."" So what do the state’s speeding laws actually say? North Carolina, like most other states, has absolute speed limits. For example, if a person is in a 35 mph zone but is driving at any speed faster than that, it’s a violation of a law.  With that being said, the state follows what’s known as ""basic"" speeding law, which stipulates that ""no person shall drive a vehicle on a highway or in a public vehicular area at a speed greater than is reasonable and prudent under the conditions then existing."" DrivingLaws.com explains it this way: a person can safely drive 55 mph on a clear, sunny day, but in conditions that are snowy and icy, that speed would be dangerous and could violate basic speeding law. A Facebook post claimed that a new law was passed in North Carolina on April 11 that drivers could not go 5 mph over the speed limit, and could be stopped for going one mile over it.  No new law was passed stating this. North Carolina, like other states, follows absolute law, which means that a person driving at any speed over the posted limit in an area is in violation of the law. However, it allows for basic law, which rules that a person can drive at a speed that is reasonable and safe under favorable conditions.  We rate this Facebook post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AB9680>],/factchecks/2022/apr/14/facebook-posts/pump-brakes-no-law-stipulating-drivers-cant-go-5-m/

Fact-checking an ad against Georgia’s Brian Kemp, false claims about the 2020 election
","Republican voters in Georgia are being told that GOP Gov. Brian Kemp, who is seeking re-election, is not up to defeating the expected Democratic nominee, Stacey Abrams. The warning comes in a TV ad from Get Georgia Right, a conservative super PAC that says its aim is to elect Republicans in Georgia and for president.  Kemp ""dismissed concerns about voter fraud in the 2020 election"" and ""widespread illegal ballot harvesting continued, electing two Democrat senators,"" the narrator claims in the 30-second spot, which shows people appearing to place ballots inside drop boxes.  ""If Kemp can’t beat voter fraud, he won’t beat Stacey Adams,"" the ad said. The ad does not mention Kemp’s competitor for the Republican nomination in the May 24 primary, former U.S. Sen. David Perdue. But Politico reported April 13 that Get Georgia Right is dedicated to defeating Kemp and that it received $500,000 from former President Donald Trump’s Save America PAC. That accounts for nearly all the funds that Get Georgia Right had on hand as of March 31, according to its latest report to the Federal Election Commission.  There is no evidence to back the ad’s illegal voting claims. The roughly 5 million ballots cast in Georgia in the 2020 presidential election were counted three times, including once by hand. Georgia state and local officials found no evidence of systematic voter fraud. The secretary of state’s office investigated claims about dead or otherwise ineligible voters and debunked allegations of fraud, such as the false claim that election workers in Atlanta were caught on tape secretly counting ""suitcases"" of fake ballots. We rated a Perdue claim that the 2020 presidential election and subsequent Georgia Senate runoff elections ""were stolen"" Pants on Fire.  The winners of the runoffs, which were held because no candidate won more than 50% of the vote in the November 2020 elections, are the two Democratic senators the ad alludes to: Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. In the runoffs, Ossoff defeated Perdue and Warnock defeated Sen. Kelly Loeffler.  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, certified those results, affirming that the returns ""are a true and correct tabulation of the certified returns received by this office from each county."" Kemp signed off on the certification. Kemp in November 2020 rejected calls from state Republican leaders for a special legislative session to tighten voter residency requirements for the runoffs, saying: ""Any changes to Georgia’s election laws made in a special session will not have any impact on an ongoing election and would only result in endless litigation.""  In March 2021, Kemp signed legislation that adds new identification requirements to absentee voting and limits ballot drop boxes. Kemp’s office said in November 2021 it identified dozens of ""inconsistencies"" in the 2020 election. But those instances did not warrant an investigation by the state election board, Kemp said.  ""Ballot harvesting""generally refers to someone collecting absentee ballots on behalf of others and then submitting them to official election drop boxes.  In Georgia, it is generally illegal to collect and submit multiple mail ballots. Exceptions are made for physically disabled voters. Raffensperger in January said that his office was investigating claims of ballot harvesting, but ""no one has alleged that those are fraudulent ballots. Those were lawful voters."" So far, claims that widespread fraudulent votes were cast via illegal ballot harvesting remain unproven.  Get Georgia Right told PolitiFact it obtained videos from various Georgia counties that it said show ""tens of thousands of ballots that were cast beyond the single ballot allowed per person using a drop box"" in the November 2020 and January 2021 runoff elections, exceeding the margins of victory in the presidential race and both runoffs. The group did not share those videos with PolitiFact and it did not say whether it had submitted those videos to authorities for an investigation. Moreover, even if people violated the law by submitting ballots for multiple people, that alone would not make the ballots invalid. The law does not say that illegal ballot harvesting, in and of itself, invalidates the ballots or makes them illegal. True the Vote, a conservative Texas group that says it works to protect the integrity of elections, in January 2022 also alleged ballot harvesting in the November 2020 and January 2021 elections. Last year, the Georgia Bureau of Investigation said there wasn’t enough evidence to proceed on the allegation.  True the Vote has since said it has a witness, but has yet to reveal the person’s identity. The State Election Board voted March 16 to issue subpoenas to the group to obtain the name of the witness.  If neither Perdue nor Kemp gets more than 50% of the primary vote, there will be a runoff on June 21.  In the Nov. 8 general election, the Republican nominee is expected to face Abrams, who is unopposed in the Democratic primary. Kemp won his first term as governor in 2018 by defeating Abrams, a former George state lawmaker, by about 50% to 49%.  Campaign watchers rate the general election as a toss up and ""tilts Republican.""  Get Georgia Right, a conservative super PAC, said Kemp ""dismissed concerns about voter fraud in the 2020 election"" and ""widespread illegal ballot harvesting continued, electing two Democrat senators."" Kemp dismissed claims of voter fraud after investigations showed there was no evidence that such fraud happened in the 2020 election or in the January 2021 runoffs. Two Georgia Democrats were elected to the U.S. Senate in the runoffs and their election results were certified by state officials in Georgia who were Republicans. The claim that illegal ballot harvesting happened in Georgia is not proven. We rate the claim False.

Claim about smartphones given to immigrants misses key context: they’re used for tracking
","A tool used by the government to track people who entered the country illegally is being mischaracterized on social media as a smartphone giveaway. Conservative pundit Nick Adams shared a post April 11 featuring a screenshot of his own tweet from the previous week. ""Joe Biden is giving smartphones away to illegal border crossers,"" Adams said. ""This is an impeachable offense."" Although smartphones are being distributed to immigrants, their purpose and usability is very limited. Immigration officials are issuing the phones so they can monitor immigrants released from custody; the phones cannot be used for other purposes, like going on Facebook or calling friends. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fox News reporter Bill Melugin shared photographs on Twitter a day before Adams’ tweet that reportedly showed the type of phone given to people detained by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Melugin said he was told by sources that detainees are ""given these phones by the government to track them and allow them to communicate with ICE."" A spokesperson for ICE confirmed to PolitiFact that the agency gives smartphones to some immigrants who have been detained after entering the country illegally. The phones come with some caveats.  The devices do not have the capability to make personal phone calls, check social media or browse the internet, the spokesperson said.  Instead, the phones are pre-loaded with an application called SmartLINK as a way to track immigrants who have been released from detention and are awaiting a deportation hearing.  SmartLINK is part of ICE's Alternative to Detention program to closely track ""non-detained noncitizens at varying levels of supervision, using several different monitoring technologies,"" ICE’s spokesperson said.  The app requires someone to check in with immigration officials either by uploading a selfie or answering a call from their case manager, according to the Associated Press. The application was first used in 2018 to keep track of about 5,000 people, the AP reported. Now, ICE uses it to keep tabs on more than 125,000 immigrants. Not all immigrants detained by ICE get a government-issued device, the agency’s spokesperson said.  ""If a noncitizen acquires their own personally owned smartphone, the SmartLINK application can be loaded onto that device,"" the spokesperson said.  SmartLINK was developed by BI Inc., a subsidiary of private prison company the GEO Group. The BI Inc. logo appears on the box featured in Melugin’s photos. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged the smartphones during a briefing on April 8, saying it's one of several ways the government can track someone after being released from detention.   ""Yes, there is telephonic reporting,"" she said. ""There is SmartLINK, which enables participant monitoring via smartphone. There’s the Global Positioning System. These are the range of means with modern technology that we monitor."" The SmartLINK monitoring program has been used by past administrations, including the Trump administration. Adams’ claim about the phones being an impeachable offense for Biden doesn’t hold much water, either.  The Constitution says a sitting president can be removed from office if they are convicted of ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors.""  Adams doesn’t provide a reason as to why the issuance of smartphones is grounds for impeachment. A Facebook post claims immigrants who enter the country illegally are receiving smartphones under President Biden and argues that he should be impeached for it.  The smartphones given to immigrants detained by ICE are used to track them with a pre-installed application after being released from custody. The phones cannot be used for anything else. ICE has been using the phones and the tracking application since 2018, before Biden became president.  The post is partially accurate, but leaves out important details and context. We rate it Half True.

That wasn’t bird poop on Biden’s jacket. It was distillers grains
","All presidents face some bad luck while in office as events they often can’t control affect their agendas. But one would have to have pretty bad luck — or pretty good luck, by some beliefs — to get pooped on by a bird indoors while giving a speech. That’s what many on social media are falsely claiming happened during President Joe Biden’s visit to Menlo, Iowa, on April 12. ""A bird pooped on Joe Biden during his speech today. You can’t make this up,"" read the headline of a video posted on Facebook by conservative activist Ryan Fournier. Actually, you can make this stuff up.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Biden was at the indoor event at a bioprocessing plant to discuss an effort to lower gas prices by lifting a summertime ban on higher-ethanol gasoline blends. While he was speaking, a substance fell and splattered on his suit jacket. Biden did not appear to notice and continued his remarks. But it was not bird poop that landed on Biden, according to the Des Moines Register. The paper reported that while there were birds in what the president called the ""giant barn"" where the event was held, one of its photographers said the substance was distillers grains, which it described as a ""a co-product of the ethanol production process."" The article shared a wider photograph of the scene showing a large pile of the grain near the stage. It also showed a closeup image of the president’s jacket, which clearly shows a yellow color, not the traditional white usually dropped on us by our avian friends. Justin Sink, a White House reporter for Bloomberg, tweeted that the substance was bits of corn that were flying around the site. Kate Bedingfield, the White House communications director, tweeted to the RNC that ""If you guys knew your way around a corn silo at all, you'd know it was corn."" An article by the conservative website RedState backs the White House explanation. It shared a video from another angle, posted to Twitter by the local news site Iowa Starting Line, in which you can see the grain flying around the room off the top of the giant pile. The article also shares a tweet by NBC News reporter Gary Grumbach, who was at the event and said, ""Corn powder particles were dripping on all of us periodically throughout the event."" Fournier was not the only one spreading the false claim. Also participating in the misinformed smear were the New York Post,the Republican National Committee and Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who added some bird sound effects to the video. It became clear fairly soon after that the theory was a load of bird poop, but by that point the video had been widely shared. A Facebook claim said that a bird did its business on Biden’s jacket while the president was delivering a speech in Iowa. Something did stain the president’s suit during his speech, but it was distillers grains, according to reporters in the room and the White House. A video clearly shows particles flying around from a giant, nearby grain pile.

Chemtrails are not real, no matter what Alexa says
","Amazon’s virtual, voice-activated assistant Alexa can dish out everything from weather to music — and conspiracy theories, too. A TikTok video suggests that Alexa confirmed so-called chemtrails are being used to reduce the human population. The video showed a woman asking Alexa, ""What is the purpose of spraying chemtrails?"" Alexa answered, ""Chemtrails are being sprayed across the entire planet, not just here in America, to accomplish many goals. The main one being to reduce the human population of the earth."" The TikTok video was shared on Facebook on April 6 and was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Despite Alexa’s answer, ""chemtrails"" are not real. They are a conspiracy theory that claims that the condensation trails behind aircrafts are part of a secret, large-scale atmospheric spraying program. Following a 2016 survey of atmospheric chemists and geochemists, a resulting study said that ""well-understood physical and chemical processes"" debunk the alleged evidence for chemtrails. For this story, we asked Alexa the same question from the TikTok video, ""What is the purpose of spraying chemtrails?"" Alexa answered, ""The purpose of chemtrails might be weather control, solar radiation control or testing of various agents on people, flora or fauna."" People who spread the chemtrails conspiracy theory cite varying alleged purposes for them, including weather modification, chemical or biological weapons testing and manipulating stock prices by damaging crops. It’s not the first time Alexa has been spotlighted for giving dubious answers about chemtrails. In 2018, stories reported that when asked, ""What’s a chemtrail?"" Alexa answered that they are ""chemical or biological agents deliberately sprayed at high altitudes for a purpose undisclosed to the general public in clandestine programs directed by government officials."" At that time, Mashable reported that an Amazon representative said it was an error that had been corrected. We reached out to Amazon for comment about the TikTok video, and a spokesperson said, ""Alexa pulls from a variety of sources to respond to questions. We have blocked this response and are continually advancing our systems to ensure Alexa is accurate, relevant and helpful to customers."" In the past, when other videos made claims about Alexa responses that could not be replicated by others, Amazon gave a few explanations for why it might have happened. For example, customers can record and schedule responses for Alexa, which would only play on that customer’s device. Or users also can access templates for trivia games, birthday cards and flashcards to create automated questions and responses. Amazon also has a program called Alexa Answers that allows anyone to provide answers for Alexa to read aloud. The company said it vets the answers, but ""a dedicated number of Alexa Answers pranksters have spent untold hours flooding the service with obvious trash,"" Mashable reported. We searched the Alexa Answers online database for the keyword ""chemtrails.""

Scientific evidence does not support ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19
","Despite a lack of scientific evidence, proponents of using ivermectin to treat COVID-19 continue to claim that the drug is a viable option. One April 6 post on Facebook suggests ivermectin is an effective treatment for the virus. ""Despite doctor testimonials, clinical trials and international studies showing the efficacy of ivermectin, mainstream media continues to suppress info regarding the drug as a treatment for COVID-19,"" says the post from One America News, a conservative cable news service. The post is an ad for an April 9 program on the network, and it continues, ""What is the history and the benefits of ivermectin? Tune in for the facts!"" The Facebook post was flagged as part of the platform's efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But scientific evidence does not support the use of ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19. A large clinical trial published March 30, 2022, in the New England Journal of Medicine found that ivermectin did not decrease either hospitalizations or prolonged emergency room stays among COVID-19 patients. Other, earlier research of the drug had significant limitations: Initial studies were small, with just a few hundred participants, and one analysis of nearly two dozen trials was later retracted. Ivermectin is an anti-parasitic drug that is used in humans to treat conditions known as river blindness and lymphatic filariasis. Some forms are also used in animals to prevent heartworm disease and parasites. The drug is not approved by the FDA for prevention or treatment of COVID-19. The New England Journal of Medicine trial was double-blind, randomized and placebo-controlled, considered the ""gold standard"" of studies. In the trial, 3,515 symptomatic COVID-19 patients were recruited from 12 public health clinics in Brazil and given either ivermectin, a placebo or another intervention. ""The administration of ivermectin did not result in a lower incidence of medical admission to a hospital or (lower incidence of) prolonged emergency department observation for Covid-19 among outpatients at high risk for serious illness,"" the study said. Experts noted that while other trials of ivermectin are ongoing, they ""doubted that the additional trials would come to a different conclusion, since the (Brazil) trial was so large and carefully designed,"" the New York Times reported. Earlier studies of the drug had at most a few hundred participants, and ""small studies can be vulnerable to statistical flukes that suggest positive effects where none actually exist,"" according to the New York Times.  A December 2020 study that reviewed results from 23 trials initially seemed to show positive outcomes from use of ivermectin, but ""reports surfaced that many of the studies (that were) included in the analysis were flawed and, in at least one case, alleged to be fraudulent,"" the New York Times reported. The study was retracted, and when the authors did a new, more rigorous version of it, ""ivermectin’s benefit vanished."" A Facebook post suggests ivermectin is an effective treatment for COVID-19. Scientific evidence does not support the use of ivermectin as a treatment for COVID-19.

Kleefisch didn’t have the power to cut taxes on her own as lieutenant governor
","As she runs for the Republican nomination for governor, Rebecca Kleefisch is – understandably – touting the accomplishments during the Gov. Scott Walker administration. Kleefisch, of course, was lieutenant governor, not governor. So, her claim in a recent TV ad caught our attention. In the ad, released March 28, 2022, Kleefisch is seen speaking to a crowd declaring: ""As your lieutenant governor, I beat the liberal mob, I cut your taxes, and I protected your freedoms.""  Is that accurate?  Can the lieutenant governor – who does not introduce or write legislation, and does not sign or veto bills – cut taxes?  Let’s take a closer look at the claim, and what role – if any – Kleefisch played.  First, let’s take a look at taxes during the time Kleefisch served under Walker, who served from 2011 to 2019. During that time PolitiFact Wisconsin looked at many tax-cut claims. Indeed, there were more than $8 billion in tax cuts between 2011 and the time of a 2018 fact check. The nonpartisan state Legislative Fiscal Bureau provided the estimate of about $8.47 billion in tax savings, between income and franchise tax reductions, property tax reductions, and other cuts. So, what was Kleefisch’s role? When asked for backup, Kleefisch’s campaign team said she attended most budget briefings during the Walker administration, and during discussions around the 2017-19 budget traveled the state with the budget director to tout the plan.  Her campaign also shared an April 1, 2014 article from the Wisconsin State Journal, headlined ""Once ‘radioactive,’ Rebecca Kleefisch has become a ‘trusted ally and lieutenant’,"" in which Walker said that Kleefisch was quick to get involved after her election.   ""She was directly involved in the budget planning process during the transition period and then in each of the budget periods once we took office,"" it quotes Walker as saying. The article also noted how Kleefisch led tax roundtables ahead of the 2015-’17 budget with former Revenue Secretary Richard Chandler, and how the feedback collected at those roundtables was directly tied into plans.  Walker also testified to Kleefisch’s involvement in conversations regarding the budget:  ""Rebecca Kleefisch immediately joined me and other key members of our transition team for the daily budget briefings,"" he said in a statement. Chandler, who served as the Department of Revenue Secretary during the Walker administration, said Kleefisch organized and sat through roundtables about taxes, eventually pulling together a report that was used during budget sessions.  ""She brought back a lot of input from all of those discussions,"" Chandler said.   All of that may be true, but experts told us Kleefisch overstates her role in the ad. John Witte, a professor of political science and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, noted the formal budget is submitted every two years by the governor in Wisconsin, not the lieutenant governor.  ""It is possible, and even likely, that she had some input before the submission,"" Witte said in an email. ""How much is probably unknowable without detailed access to documents, memos, etc.""  To be sure, according to the state constitution and state laws, lieutenant governors in Wisconsin have no role in approving tax cuts or any other types of legislation. What’s more, Walker shaped many of the tax cuts, but Republicans who control the Legislature also put their stamp on them.  So while Kleefisch may have been involved in the talks surrounding budgets and tax cuts during the Walker administration, she had no direct role in cutting those taxes. In a TV ad, Kleefisch declared: ""As your lieutenant governor, I beat the liberal mob, I cut your taxes. Taxes were surely cut during the Walker administration – to the tune of more than  $8 billion during their eight years in office.  Kleefisch participated in budget discussions and held listening sessions across the state. And she may have advocated for those tax cuts, but the lieutenant governor simply isn’t responsible for voting on or signing tax cuts or other types of legislation into law.  Our definition of Mostly False is a statement that ""contains an element of the truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280973DC1C0>],/factchecks/2022/apr/13/rebecca-kleefisch/kleefisch-didnt-have-power-cut-taxes-her-own-lieut/

We could find no news reports or documentation that shows 350,000 Disney+ subscriptions have been canceled. The company does not routinely report on the fluctuations of their subscribers.  Disney declined to comment. The company last released subscriber statistics in February 2022 in a first quarter earnings report. At the time, Disney said it had added 11.8 million Disney+ subscribers, bringing the total to 129.8 million.  The next update on subscription figures will be during Disney’s next quarterly earnings call on May 11 and would be the only place where it would share more information. HB 1557 prohibits classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade.  Supporters of the law hail the need for parents, and not teachers, to have control over such discussions, part of a broader push to control the content of classroom lessons. But critics warn it isn’t necessary and makes some students feel unsafe by singling out LGBTQ material as dangerous and inappropriate. Facebook posts claim Disney lost over 350,000 Disney+ subscription days after conservatives called for boycotts. There is no evidence to support this. Disney has not released any data on its subscription numbers since February and more figures will be reported after the company’s next quarterly earnings call in May.

Racist Facebook post is real, but it was not made by the chairman of Virginia’s Republican Party
","A Virginia politician resigned days after news surfaced that he wrote a racist Facebook post about two Black military leaders, including U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin.

RT IF YOU THINK HE MUST BE EXPELLED! A Twitter user saw the tweet and asked us if it was true. The person who made the statements was a local official, not someone in a statewide leadership position. Occupy Democrats later sent a corrected tweet. The real author of the post was David Dietrich, who is not the chairman of Virginia’s GOP. Rather, he’s the chairman of the Hampton Electoral Board in Virginia. Dietrich led the three-member board, which oversees elections in Hampton’s city of over 137,000 residents. Hampton is located in the southeastern part of Virginia, near the city of Norfolk.  Dietrich made the post in February 2021. Under the headline ""Military Purge,"" Deitrich lashed out at Austin’s appointment as defense secretary, saying that Austin was ""standing down the military to ferret out ‘white nationalists’"" in order to ""remove conservative, freedom-loving Americans from the roles."" He also bashed retired Army Lt. Gen. Russel L. Honoré, whom House Speaker Nancy Pelosi tasked with leading a review of security at the Capitol following the Jan. 6 insurrection. ""To listen to this guy, you would think he was a Black Nationalist,"" Dietrich wrote.  Dietrich went on to call the two military leaders ""nothing more than dirty, stinking n------"" and said, ""Perhaps the best way to pull us back from the brink is a good public lynching.""  A local Virginia TV station, WAVY-TV, was the first to break the story on April 8, 2022. It reported that Dietrich’s comments came to light after the Republican Party of Hampton released them in a statement. The party said it was made aware of Dietrich’s post the week before. It condemned Dietrich’s comments as ""abhorrent and unacceptable"" and called for him to resign, as did Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, a Republican.  ""The abhorrent words of a Hampton Roads official are beyond unacceptable and have no place in Virginia,"" Youngkin wrote. ""It’s time to resign."" As governor, I serve all Virginians. I won’t accept racism in our Commonwealth or our party. The abhorrent words of a Hampton Roads official are beyond unacceptable and have no place in Virginia. It’s time to resign. https://t.co/w2pnl95jrl After initially refusing to do so, Dietrich resigned on April 9.

After stopping to visit U.S. troops a day earlier, Biden was greeted at the presidential palace in Warsaw on March 26 by Polish President Andrzej Duda. In one image from the president of Poland’s official website (see the seventh image in the gallery at the bottom), you can see what looks like scaffolding on the left side of the building and the wall almost looks like a painting. We reached out to Jakub Szymczuk, Duda’s official photographer who took the photo, for an explanation, but have not received a response.  We also reached out to the White House, the Secret Service, Duda’s office and other photographers at the scene to explain the building’s appearance, but didn’t hear back. The exterior of the building looked different in this Oct. 26, 2021, photo when Jordan’s King Abdullah II visited the palace, and on March 19, 2017, when Germany's President Frank-Walter Steinmeier visited. Articles translated from Polish from August discuss planned renovations on all presidential properties, including the presidential palace. And the chancellery of the President of the Republic of Poland sent a statement to PolitiFact, confirming that renovation work on the facade of the presidential palace has begun. It’s clear the building itself is real, as was Biden’s visit. Wider photographs and videos from the scene show the full courtyard of the palace and Biden’s arrival. Biden was photographed visiting with U.S. troops on March 25 and giving a speech outside the Royal Castle in Warsaw on March 26 after his visit with Duda. The trip was widely covered by major news outlets, such as Fox News, the Wall Street Journal, the New York Times and many others, with no suggestion the event was staged. Szymczuk, Duda’s photographer, posted a selfie with Biden inside the palace on Facebook the same day. The palace was built in the 1640s and has served many purposes over the centuries, according to the official website of the Polish president. The main body of the palace was mostly destroyed by a fire in 1852 and the building has been renovated multiple times over the years. After one such renovation in 1994, it became the ""official seat of the President of the Republic of Poland,"" the site said.  PolitiFact has debunked multiple false allegations since Biden took office that he and the White House have staged various events, including that Biden created a fake set to receive a COVID-19 vaccine booster, that he faked an interview in front of a green screen, and that an anti-lynching bill signing ceremony didn’t really happen. We can add this claim to the list. A Facebook post alleged that Biden’s trip to Poland was staged because the Presidential Palace in Warsaw looks fake. It does appear that there may be something covering the exterior of the building, but wider shots and video show the whole courtyard of the palace. Polish websites show articles from August detailing planned renovations at presidential properties. In addition, there was widespread news coverage, some of it live, of Biden’s stop in Poland, which included a visit with U.S. troops and a speech outside the Royal Castle. To believe Biden’s trip to Europe was staged would mean believing a widespread conspiracy involving another country and the media. We rate this claim False.

This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s start with money laundering.  Ukraine is ""not even close"" to being the money laundering capital of the world, said Moyara Ruehsen, who oversees the financial crime management program at Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. Ruehsen pointed us to two lists used to gauge money laundering risk around the world.  First is the Basel AML Index, with AML standing for anti-money laundering.  According to the global ranking in 2021, Haiti was No. 1, followed by the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Myanmar, Mozambique and the Cayman Islands. Ukraine was 55th, landing between Russia (44th) and the United States (83rd).   Next, Ruehsen directed us to the jurisdictions under increased monitoring by the Financial Action Task Force, a global watchdog that sets international standards aimed at preventing money laundering. The task force keeps a ""grey list"" — countries under increased monitoring as they address deficiencies in their anti-money laundering — and a ""black list,"" countries Ruehsen said people shouldn’t do business with at all.  Ukraine is on neither list. (Iran and North Korea are on the black list.) The European Commission also identifies high-risk countries that have ""strategic deficiencies in their regime on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism."" Afghanistan, Cambodia, and Pakistan are on the list, but Ukraine is not among them.  Ukraine was on FATF’s ""grey list"" about 20 years ago, Ruehsen said, and up until 2014, when the country’s former president, Viktor Yanukovych, was overthrown, Ukrainian leadership was widely considered to be corrupt. ""I don’t doubt it that a lot of that corrupt behavior trickled down to lower levels of government,"" Ruehsen said. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, the country’s current president, campaigned on addressing corruption. The claim that Ukraine is the money laundering capital of the world, she said, ""sounds like Russian propaganda.""  As for sex trafficking, we’ve previously debunked a claim that Russian President Vladimir Putin vowed to ""‘crush’ child sex traffickers in Ukraine."" According to the State Department’s latest Trafficking in Persons report, Russia has a more serious problem with child sex trafficking than Ukraine. Both countries struggle with the issue, the report said, but Ukraine took action to address it between 2020 and 2021, while Russia failed to make ""significant efforts"" to eliminate the problem. While Ukraine convicted traffickers, increased financial assistance to victims, and launched awareness campaigns, Russia ""convicted only one trafficker,"" failed to ""initiate any new prosecutions of suspected traffickers,"" and ""offered no funding or programs to provide services for trafficking victims."" Russia, not Ukraine, is among 11 governments the report says have ""a documented ‘policy or pattern’ of human trafficking, trafficking in government-funded programs, forced labor in government-affiliated medical services or other sectors, sexual slavery in government camps, or employment or recruitment of child soldiers.  The report also ranks countries based on the extent of government efforts to meet minimum standards for the elimination of human trafficking. Tier 1, the United States’ ranking, is the highest, but it doesn’t mean the country has no human trafficking problems. Rather, it means the country fully meets minimum standards to eliminate trafficking. Tier 2 — Ukraine’s tier — means a country’s government doesn’t fully meet the minimum standards but is making significant efforts to bring itself into compliance. Tier 3 includes countries such as Afghanistan and Russia that don’t meet the minimum standards and aren’t trying to.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BF4140>],/factchecks/2022/apr/12/viral-image/no-ukraine-isnt-money-laundering-or-child-sex-traf/

There’s no evidence planes sprayed people protesting the Dakota Access pipeline with poison
","More than five years after the fact, some social media users are circulating claims that hundreds of people who spent months protesting the construction of the Dakota Access pipeline were attacked with harmful chemicals. One such Facebook post, which was first shared in March 2020, was still generating buzz online as recently as April 8. ""If you were in Standing Rock the months of Oct to Nov 2016, you were intentionally poisoned by the Governor of North Dakota Jack Dalrymple, Kyle Kirchmeier of Morton County Sheriffs Department and the pilot who knowingly sprayed poisonous chemicals over the Standing Rock Oceti Sakowin and Sacred Stone Camps,"" it read.  The post went on to claim that the Morton County Sheriff’s Department ""directed a secret operation"" that used agricultural aircraft to spray ""an aerosol called Chlorophacinone, also known as ROZOL"" on protesters each night for nearly seven weeks. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Standing Rock protests against the Dakota Access pipeline were not without violent conflict, but there is no evidence to suggest that protesters were sprayed with poisonous chemicals. From around April 2016 through February 2017, thousands of people gathered near the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe’s reservation in North Dakota to protest the construction of a 1,172-mile crude oil pipeline, known as the Dakota Access pipeline. At the same time, the tribe waged a legal battle in an effort to block the pipeline — arguing that the project was a threat to native lands and could contaminate their water supply. Protesters were pepper sprayed, tear gassed, struck with rubber bullets, hosed with water in below-freezing temperatures and attacked by security dogs. Some complained of what they characterized as a mysterious plane flying overhead during the protests. But government officials and people involved in the demonstrations have both refuted claims that planes sprayed protesters with harmful chemicals.  Rozol, an anticoagulant poison that causes animals to bleed to death, is often used to kill prairie dogs by putting pellets into their burrows. It is a restricted-use pesticide, so only certified pesticide applicators in some states can use it. Rumors that Rozol was used on protesters arose after an Environmental Protection Agency investigation found that in 2016, a private rancher had illegally used 40,000 pounds of Rozol poison to attempt to kill black-tailed prairie dogs near the Standing Rock Sioux Reservation, where the protests occurred. The Bismarck Tribune reported that instead of being put into burrows, Rozol pellets were ""broadcast on the ground,"" and dead prairie dogs were left unmoved, endangering other wildlife. Researchers from United Tribes Technical College studied the incident. Referring to the protesters as ""campers,"" they wrote that, as colder winter temperatures set in, ""widespread respiratory illnesses among some campers became prevalent."" Though rumors emerged that Rozol was responsible for the illness that protesters started calling ""DAPL cough,"" there was no conclusive evidence of a connection. ""Although there are statements posted online that some campers have had medical tests that showed Rozol exposure or analyses of their tents that showed Rozol residue, those test results have not been confirmed or are not reliably available, and so the true nature of the illness is still not clear,"" researchers wrote.  The researchers also noted that it was possible some of the protesters’ camp sites were set up on land where the Rozol had been illegally distributed. At least one of the protesters’ camps was set up on Cannonball Ranch land, according to a Seattle Times report. The Rozol was illegally distributed across more than 5,400 acres of land, some of which was part of the Cannonball Ranch.  However, North Dakota officials refuted claims that Rozol was responsible for ""DAPL Cough"" symptoms. The government’s ND Response website attributed the symptoms to the protesters’ living conditions, which included tents and other non-insulated structures in temperatures that often go below zero.   A light inside a tent glows as a person walks by at the Oceti Sakowin camp where people have gathered to protest the Dakota Access oil pipeline in Cannon Ball, N.D. on Nov. 29, 2016. (AP)​ ND Response wrote that common temporary forms of heat ""have been known to cause lung, nose, and eye irritation."" The statement concluded: ""An ongoing cough is not consistent with Rozol exposure."" Dallas Goldtooth is a spokesperson for the Indigenous Environmental Network, one of the organizations involved in the protests, and was often quoted during national coverage of the demonstrations. He called the claims ""wild rumors"" in a December 2016 Facebook post. ""No we are not being sprayed with chemicals,"" he wrote. ND Response also addressed claims that crop duster planes had sprayed protesters with chemicals, saying the state had ""routinely conducted aerial surveillance of the camps"" in an effort to assess the number of people present, which would be important to ensure protesters' safety if a mass evacuation were required.  ""At the time the rumor started, there were videos posted on social media alleging chemicals being sprayed which depicted law enforcement officers without respiratory gear,"" the state agency behind the website said. ""Authorities would never spray a crowd with mustard gas or other lethal chemicals, particularly with unprotected law enforcement officers present."" A post claimed Dakota Access pipeline protesters were ""intentionally poisoned"" by government officials in North Dakota when a pilot ""knowingly sprayed poisonous chemicals"" over their camps. We found no evidence to suggest planes dropped a poisonous chemical on people protesting the Dakota Access pipeline. People involved in the protests and state officials have refuted this claim.

No, the COVID-19 vaccines do not contain ‘HIV lipid wrappers’
","Since the first COVID-19 vaccines became available to the public in late 2020, people have falsely claimed that all sorts of nefarious things are in them, including aluminum, graphene oxide and microchips.

""Covid mRNA vaccines are encased in lipid nanoparticles to ensure their delivery to cells … There is no relationship with HIV,"" said Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health and Security.

No, Virginia's House did not vote to cut school funding
","Virginia’s Democratic Party says the Republican-controlled House of Delegates wants to gut funding for public schools. ""This session, Republicans launched attack after attack on Virginia’s public schools, teachers and students,"" the party said in an April 4 news release. ""They have repeatedly threatened to defund public education and their budget is proof of their true intentions. The proposed House budget cuts hundreds of millions in funding for public education, including gutting teacher pay raises by 20% and slashing tens of millions in funding for early childhood education."" We’ll focus this fact check on the Democrats’ central claim: ""The proposed House budget cuts hundreds of millions in funding from public education."" It’s a highly misleading statement that carries over to other claims the party makes. The General Assembly is hashing out a new two-year state budget that will go into effect July 1. Former Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, proposed his final budget in December 2021 - one month before leaving office. The House and the Senate separately amended Northam’s plan, and each chamber approved its own two-year budget.  House and Senate budget negotiators are now hammering out their differences. After the legislature approves a compromise, its budget will be sent to the new governor,  Republican Glenn Youngkin. Virginia is brimming with cash as revenues during pandemic-struck 2021 came in 14% higher than predicted.  The Democrat-led Senate - following Northam’s lead - views the surplus as an opportunity to expand programs, especially in education and mental health, with some room for tax relief.  The Republican-led House - following Youngkin’s lead - is heavily focused on cutting taxes and issuing rebates. Even so, the House’s budget would increase general fund spending on education by 14.5% from the current two-year budget to the coming two-year plan. The current base budget for public schools is $14.8 billion. The House would raise it to $16.95 billion in the next biennial budget, a $2.15 billion boost to education spending over the next two fiscal years. How does the Democratic Party figure that the House budget cuts ""hundreds of millions"" from public education?  It doesn’t compare spending in the current budget to approved House spending in the next.  Instead, it compares the money Northam proposed spending in his budget for the next two years to the amount the House approved. The party doesn’t reveal that in its news release, which was featured on the landing page of its website. Northam proposed spending $17.2 billion in general funds for education for the next two years - a $2.4 billion increase over the current budget. In other words, the party’s starting point in claiming the House budget deeply cuts education is bolstered by $2.4 billion that hasn’t existed in the past. Another way to describe it: Northam proposed a $2.4 billion increase to education over the next two years while the House approved a $2.15 billion hike. That’s a $250 million difference in new investment in education, not the amount that would be cut. At the risk of more complication, the Senate has proposed $17.5 billion in general fund spending on education over the next two years - an 18.2% increase over the previous budget and $550 million more than the House approved. Negotiators are seeking a compromise. The Democratic Party, seeking to back its claim, sent us a list of education programs that the House budget would reduce in funding from Northam’s recommended levels.  The list underscores serious policy differences between the House and Senate. But the House did not cut any of the cited programs from their current budget levels. For example: Northam’s budget proposed giving teachers a 5% raise in each of the next two school years. The House approved a 4% raise each year with 1% bonuses.  Northam sought $268 million in new funding to create more spots for at-risk three-year-olds in the state’s preschool program. The House approved a $59 million increase. The House rejected an $8 million Northam proposal to expand STEM programs. The House nixed a $22 million proposal to hire more instructors to teach English as a second language.  The Democratic Party of Virginia said in a news release, ""The proposed House budget cuts hundreds of millions in funding for public education…"" The release, featured on the party’s website, creates the wrong impression that the Republican-controlled House of Delegates wants to slash the state’s current education budget. To the contrary, the House has passed a new two-year state budget that would increase school spending by $2.15 billion – or 14.5% - over the current biennium. What the party didn’t say, however, is that it was not comparing spending levels in the current two-year budget to those in the House-approved budget for the next two-years. Instead, it compared the $17.2 billion that former Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam recommended spending on education over the next two years to the $16.95 billion the House has approved. The House sliced $250 million from Northam’s proposal. If Democrats had said that, they’d have been correct. But it is misleading to suggest that the House budget would cut Virginia’s actual spending on education. We rate the Democratic Party’s statement False.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280971F9D00>],/factchecks/2022/apr/12/democratic-party-virginia/no-virginias-house-did-not-vote-cut-school-funding/

Attack ad on Sen. Mike Lee advising Trump on 2020 election omits that Lee opposed overturning result
","As investigators continue to analyze what led to the mob attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Sen. Mike Lee was hit with an ad over his connection to the insurrection. The Utah Republican, endorsed for re-election by former President Donald Trump, was targeted by his main challenger,  independent candidate and former Republican Evan McMullin. ""Senator Mike Lee advised Trump's legal challenges to overturn our election,"" the narrator says at the start of McMullin’s 30-second TV ad. ""He was one of only two senators who was in on the scheme, receiving the plan four days before the January 6th insurrection."" Lee and another Republican senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, advised Trump’s legal team in its efforts to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election. But Lee ultimately broke with Trump, concluding there was no evidence for taking the victory away from Joe Biden. On Jan. 6, 2021, then-President Trump held his ""Save America"" rally where he repeated his Pants on Fire claim that he won the 2020 election. Trump invited the crowd to ""walk down to the Capitol"" where the House and Senate were holding a joint session to certify the electoral college vote for Biden. A mob breached the Capitol and shut down Congress for hours.  Early Jan. 7, after the attack was quelled, Congress certified Biden’s win. Lee and Graham voted to certify the presidential election results and against objections to certifying the results in Arizona and Pennsylvania. In supporting the election result, Lee said on the Senate floor: ""I’ve met with lawyers on both sides of the issue. I’ve met with lawyers representing the Trump campaign, reading everything I could find about the constitutional provisions in question, and I’ve spent a lot of time on the phone with legislators and other leaders from the contested states…. ""I spent an enormous amount of time reaching out to state government officials in those states, but in none of the contested states — no, not even one — did I discover any indication that there was any chance that any state legislature, or secretary of state, or governor, or lieutenant governor, had any intention to alter the slate of electors."" Details of Lee’s actions have been publicly reported. ""Peril,"" a September 2021 book by Washington Post associate editor Bob Woodward and reporter Robert Costa described how Graham and Lee took the claims of election fraud seriously enough to get briefed on the details, involve their senior staff and call state officials throughout the country.  As summarized by the Post, a key document was a memo written about counting electoral votes by conservative legal scholar John Eastman, who is referenced in the ad. Lee received an Eastman memo from the White House that said Vice President Mike Pence could ignore seven states that had submitted dueling slates of electors to Congress, split between Trump and Biden, and count only electors from the remaining states, handing the election to Trump.  Woodward and Costa reported that Lee knew the alternate electors were merely Trump loyalists putting themselves forward in certain states, in a move the authors describe as ""a social media campaign — an amateur push with no legal standing."" Lee said that he made ""phone call after phone call"" to officials in some of the relevant states, such as Georgia, Pennsylvania and Arizona, saying that no one seemed poised to certify a new slate of electors. ""At that point, I believed that we had reached the end of the process, as indeed we had,"" Lee said during a Jan. 27, 2012 online town hall.  A Utah newspaper, the Deseret News, reported more on what Lee said at the town hall. He said that Trump’s inner circle repeatedly told him that state legislatures were acting to decertify or even recertify their slates of electoral votes before Congress convened on Jan. 6. As that date approached, Lee said, ""I became concerned because I wasn’t seeing any of these developments occur but I was continuing to hear this narrative.""  Lee said that after calling governors, attorneys general, secretaries of state and legislative leaders in several states, not one state was willing or inclined to decertify or recertify their electoral votes. UTpolunderground.com, a political news website, also carried an article about Lee’s outreach to state officials and his conclusion that there was no evidence to overturn the election. When we asked Lee’s campaign for comment, a spokesperson referred us to the UTpolunderground.com article. On April 1, the same day McMullin tweeted out his ad, Trump endorsed Lee, calling McMullin ""McMuffin."" McMullin, a former CIA operative, was a Republican before running as an independent for president in 2016. He made news in February with reports showing he raised more campaign money than Lee in the final quarter of 2021.  Democrat Kael Weston, a former State Department official, is campaigning for the Senate seat, but the Utah Democratic Party is being pressured to not field a candidate in hopes of giving McMullin a better shot to defeat Lee, the Deseret News reported. The Utah race could play a role in determining which party controls the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Campaign watchers rate the race as solid or safe Republican. Lee, who was elected in 2010, is also being challenged in Utah’s June 28 primary. The leading Republican challengers are former Utah state lawaker Becky Edwards and communications strategist Ally Isom. McMullin claimed in an ad that Lee ""advised Trump's legal challenges to overturn our election"" and ""was one of only two senators who was in on the scheme."" Lee and another GOP senator, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, advised the Trump team’s efforts to overturn the result of the 2020 presidential election. But Lee ultimately broke with Trump, concluding there was no evidence for overturning the result. McMullin’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.

""​​Unvaccinated people in all age groups had higher case and death rates than people vaccinated with a primary series in the same age groups,"" the CDC reported as of March 17. The CDC has estimated that two or three doses of an mRNA vaccine reduce risk for COVID-19 invasive mechanical ventilation or death by 90%, and three doses of vaccine during the omicron surge reduced the risk by 94%. While there were more breakthrough COVID-19 cases with the omicron variant, vaccines continued to protect against infection, serious illness and death. While some people who are not vaccinated may not have experienced serious COVID-19 symptoms when infected, this claim ignores the data that show the virus is far more serious and fatal in people who are unvaccinated.

NYC’s ‘gay’ ad campaign to Floridians used donations, not tax money
","New York City Mayor Eric Adams approached a lectern flanked by signage that bore the word ""Gay,"" and addressed the state of Florida.  It was Monday, April 4, and standing alongside the 61-year-old mayor were 10 adults, one of whom wore a rainbow-colored face mask.  ""This is the city of Stonewall,"" Adams said, invoking the historic 1969 gay rights demonstrations that followed a police raid at the Stonewall Inn, a gay bar in New York City. ""This is the city where we are proud to talk about how you can live in a comfortable setting and not be harassed, not be abused — not only as adults but also as young people."" At the City Hall event, Adams chastised Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for signing into law HB 1557, dubbed the ""don’t say gay"" bill by critics. The legislation prohibits classroom instruction about sexual orientation and gender identity in kindergarten through third grade. Then the mayor announced an ad campaign to address the issue.  For eight weeks — starting April 4 — five pieces of creative art condemning the law will be displayed on billboards across major cities in Florida. The ad campaign was spotted on a billboard in Jacksonville, Florida, following the announcement.  We have a message for Florida’s LGBTQ+ community: come to a city where you can be you. Join us now at City Hall. https://t.co/0OOg7zigSB The move drew national media coverage and seemed to touch a nerve with DeSantis. ""Now, New York is doing billboards telling people come, come to New York from Florida,"" DeSantis said at a press conference on April 5. ""You know, they're wasting taxpayer money on doing that. I don't know why they would do it."" DeSantis’ claim sounded at odds with what Adams said when he announced the ad campaign, so we looked into it.  Adams said at the event that the campaign is ""costing New York City taxpayers nothing.""  The artwork that will be displayed on the billboards is being created by a multinational marketing company, WPP, and its subsidiaries, VMLY&R and Kinetic, among others, that won’t charge New York City for that effort. Kinetic is paying for the costs associated with putting up the billboards.  Graham Smith, the managing director of VMLY&R and the company’s lead on the effort, confirmed to PolitiFact that the creative content was donated.  The head of public affairs at WPP North America, Brian Ellner, also confirmed his firm is donating creative work and is securing donated media. Adams, Ellner said, ""pledged that no tax dollars would be used to support"" the ad campaign.  DeSantis did not return PolitiFact’s request for comment. We found no news reports or credible evidence to suggest that the city paid for the ad campaign. DeSantis said that New York City is ""wasting taxpayer money on"" placing billboards in Florida. Adams and the private marketing firms involved in the ad campaign have denied this characterization.

Twitter post wasn’t serious about Elon Musk using $3 billion to give every American family $100,000
","A viral social media post is claiming the $3 billion Elon Musk spent buying a 9% stake in Twitter should’ve been directly given to the American people instead. The April 5 tweet was made following the announcement that the Tesla CEO would join Twitter’s board of directors after purchasing 73.5 million shares of the company’s stock. ""With the money Elon Musk spent to buy Twitter shares, he could have given every American family $100,000 and still had enough left over to cancel all student debt,"" tweeted Hunter Walk, the co-founder of a venture capital firm. If Walk’s tweet sparked a sense of familiarity, it’s because it echoed a similar claim involving Michael Bloomberg. During the 2020 presidential election, a claim was made that Bloomberg’s campaign spent $500 million on advertising. A social media user at the time said the money could’ve been used to give all 327 million people in the United States $1 million each. PolitiFact found the Bloomberg critic’s math was flawed. If $500 million was actually divided among 327 million people, it would amount to about $1.53 per person. Walk’s tweet also includes faulty math. Although he doesn’t say what is considered a family, there are at least 122 million households in America with about 2.6 people per household, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. Dividing $3 billion by 122 million households would result in each unit getting $24.59, with nothing leftover to tackle student debt. Even if Musk’s $3 billion was dedicated toward paying off college loans, it wouldn’t cover a quarter-percent of what’s owed.  It's estimated that Americans owe around $1.74 trillion in student loans.  Walk later admitted he wasn’t being serious with his claim and said in one reply that it was a ""troll twete."" In a follow-up tweet on April 6, he joked about his post triggering a fact-check by Twitter’s Birdwatch feature. ""What did I learn? People on left don't do math and people on right are really willing to defend their rich icons,"" Walk said. ""And crypto folks are generally vocal but sometimes funny."" A user on Twitter said the $3 billion Elon Musk used to buy shares of Twitter could’ve been redistributed to give $100,000 to each American family and eliminate student debt. But $3 billion divided among all the families in America would be nowhere close to $100,000. It also wouldn’t even come close to covering the $1.74 trillion that Americans owe in student loans.  We rate this Twitter post as Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FBCD00>],/factchecks/2022/apr/08/tweets/twitter-post-wasnt-serious-about-elon-musk-using-3/

Fauci not discounting natural immunity to COVID-19
","An 18-year-old video of Dr. Anthony Fauci talking about the strength of natural immunity is making the rounds on social media, with some users alleging the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases is ignoring the science now when it comes to COVID-19. ""Check out this clip of Dr. Fauci in 2004 talking about the STRENGTH of Natural Immunity,"" reads an April 1 Facebook post. ""Fast forward 18 years, what happened to this ‘science?!’ Why does Fauci continue to LIE to the American people?!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Fauci’s statements were made in the context of an hour-long discussion about influenza, not COVID-19, the NIAID said in a statement to PolitiFact. Fauci supports the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s recommendation that people who have recovered from COVID-19 still get vaccinated, the agency said. Fauci’s public statements since the pandemic began show that he has not completely discounted the amount of protection natural immunity provides from COVID-19, but he has expressed uncertainty about how long the protection lasts with regard to this particular virus. Fauci’s 2004 comments on immunity came on C-SPAN’s Washington Journal after a caller suffering from the flu talked about her bad experiences with the influenza vaccine. The relevant portion of the interview begins at the 28-minute mark. Slen: ""She should not get it again this year?"" Fauci: ""She doesn’t need it, because the most potent vaccination is getting infected yourself."" Influenza and COVID-19 are both contagious respiratory viruses, but require different public health responses. While the flu can be caught year-round, generally it peaks between December and February. The CDC recommends people get flu vaccines once a year.  COVID-19 is not seasonal, spreads more easily and is far deadlier than the flu. The CDC said there have been 3.5 million flu illnesses, 34,000 hospitalizations and 2,000 deaths in the U.S. from the flu so far in the 2021-22 season. There have been more than 982,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the U.S. since 2020 and nearly 600,000 of those came in 2021, according to Johns Hopkins University data. Dr. Nicole Iovine, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida's Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Medicine, said that in 2004 our knowledge about immunity against respiratory viruses was more limited than it is today, and there was a shortage of influenza vaccines due to manufacturing issues, so that may have factored into Fauci’s advice. The NIAID confirmed that shortage played a role in Fauci’s answer. At that time, Iovine said, flu vaccines were trivalent, meaning they were designed to guard against three flu viruses. Today, they are designed to protect against four flu viruses. So, when Fauci was speaking, Iovine said, ""the benefit of flu vaccination after having the flu was somewhat diminished."" While Fauci told the viewer nearly two decades ago that she didn’t need the vaccine if she recently had the flu, he and the CDC recommend people get vaccinated against COVID-19 after they’ve recovered from the virus.  That’s for a couple of reasons. The CDC says on its website that studies show a reduced risk of reinfection in people who have had the virus and been vaccinated because the vaccine provides added protection to the immune system.  NIAID said there is no currently available reliable test to show if someone is protected against reinfection just from having the virus. Immunity from prior infection appears to have protective benefits, the agency said, but the level and durability of the protection is still unclear. Fauci also hasn’t discounted protection from natural immunity and has spoken encouragingly about it on several occasions. In March 2020, early in the pandemic, Fauci expressed optimism — and uncertainty — about how effectively natural immunity from the virus could ward off reinfection in an interview with ""The Daily Show"" host Trevor Noah.   ""We don’t know that for 100% certain, because we haven’t done the study to see rechallenges, whether they’ve been protected,"" Fauci said. ""But I feel really confident that if this virus acts like every other virus that we know, once you get infected, get better, clear the virus, then you’ll have immunity that will protect you against reinfection. So it’s never 100% but I’d be willing to bet anything that people who recover are really protected against reinfection."" Fauci also spoke about natural immunity on Sept. 9, 2021, in an interview with CNN’s Anderson Cooper and Dr. Sanjay Gupta. Gupta raised a study out of Israel that showed a strong immune response in those who had the virus and asked Fauci why people should still get vaccinated. Fauci said there could be a good argument for not getting the vaccine based on the study, but didn’t ""have a firm answer"" for Gupta. He also questioned the durability of the immune response, and said more discussion was needed. ""The one thing that paper from Israel didn't tell you is whether or not as high as the protection is with natural infection, what's the durability compared to the durability of a vaccine?"" Fauci said. ""So it is conceivable that you got infected, you're protected, but you may not be protected for an indefinite period of time."" He spoke on the issue again in an April 30, 2021, radio interview with Latino USA’s Maria Hinojosa. Fauci explained why Hinojosa should get vaccinated even though she had COVID-19 a year ago. ""It’s very likely that if you didn’t get the vaccine, your antibodies levels will start going down and down and down and down and then you might get vulnerable to reinfection, which we’ve seen in some people,"" Fauci told her.  Iovine said that immunity to COVID-19 declines after both natural infection and vaccination and scientists don’t entirely know why immunity isn’t more durable compared to typical childhood vaccines. ""Since both flu and COVID cause significant mortality, the best personal and public health strategy is to get vaccinated, rather than take the chance that one will recover from natural infection,"" said Iovine. ""The bottom line is that we should not be following 18-year-old medical advice when there is much more up-to-date, relevant and evidence-based information available to us,"" Iovine said.  Social media users are using a 2004 video of Fauci praising the strength of natural immunity to influenza to suggest he’s ignoring that science when it comes to COVID-19. Fauci’s comments in that video were specific to a question from a woman who was suffering from influenza. COVID-19 is a different and more deadly virus, and there’s no reliable test that shows the durability of immunity from an infection. Regarding COVID-19, Fauci has also spoken positively about protection from natural immunity, but questioned its durability. He recommends, as does the CDC, that people also get vaccinated for added protection. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809764C300>],/factchecks/2022/apr/08/facebook-posts/fauci-not-discounting-natural-immunity-covid-19/

Claim about German bestiality brothels is based on outdated article
","A video clip posted on Facebook uses outdated information to baselessly claim that there are bestiality brothels ""spreading"" in Germany. ""German perverts open bestiality brothels,"" says the caption on the video posted April 6 by Michael Knowles, who hosts a show at The Daily Wire, a conservative news website. In the video, Knowles reads aloud from what he says is a story published ""today"" by the British newspaper Daily Mail. Knowles read the headline of the story, ""Bestiality brothels are 'spreading through Germany' warns campaigner as abusers turn to sex with animals as 'lifestyle choice.'"" He also read the first paragraphs of the story. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the Daily Mail story that Knowles cited was published in July 2013. And even before it was published, Germany’s parliament had voted in early 2013 to criminalize ""using an animal for personal sexual activities."" In the video, Knowles said, ""One thing we predicted was that if you lift the traditional social and political restrictions on sexual activity and you redefine marriage and you redefine the whole family …you’re going to have people not just having sex with each other … you’re going to have people having sex with animals."" We reached out to Knowles for comment but did not receive a reply. The claim about bestiality brothels appears to have come from a single person who the Daily Mail identified as a ""livestock protection officer."" The officer didn’t provide any examples of the brothels but cited a German farmer who was concerned about his sheep which he said had been sexually abused by men sneaking into his barn. In the Daily Mail story, the livestock protection officer calls for the government to ban bestiality, something the German government had already done months before the story published. A bid to overturn the law was shot down by Germany's constitutional court in 2016. We did not find any credible reports of ""bestiality brothels"" spreading in Germany. The caption on an April 6 Facebook video said, ""German perverts open bestiality brothels."" It cited a Daily Mail story that allegedly was published ""today."" But the Daily Mail story was published in July 2013 and contained outdated information. The German government outlawed bestiality in February 2013. We found no credible reports to back the claim. We rate this post False.   ",[<zip object at 0x00000280972FF900>],/factchecks/2022/apr/08/michael-knowles/claim-about-german-bestiality-brothels-based-outda/

Baldwin pins blame for high insulin prices on big drug corporations, but there are other factors
","When it comes to diabetes, the numbers are stark. One in 10 Americans have the disease, and more than one in three have pre-diabetes, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. What’s more, people are developing diabetes at younger ages and a faster rate. A recent tweet from U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, who has cosponsored legislation to cap the out-of-pocket cost of insulin for Americans at $35 per month, made a stark claim of its own: ""The price of insulin has been jacked up by Big Drug Corporations,"" Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, said in the March 16, 2022, tweet. ""35 million Americans who have diabetes need lower costs. We can cap the price of insulin at $35 with our Affordable Insulin Now Act. Let's have a Senate vote and pass it!"" The House of Representatives voted a few weeks later, on March 31, 2022, to approve the Affordable Insulin Now Act, which would cap insulin prices at either $35 a month or 25% of an insurance plan's negotiated price — whichever is lower.   But the fate of the measure in the Senate remains unclear.  So what can one make of Baldwin’s tweet?  Are costs of insulin in the United States excessive? And what can be said about whether high prices are due to being ""jacked up by Big Drug Corporations""?  Diabetes is a chronic health condition that affects how your body turns food into energy. Most people’s bodies naturally produce insulin, a hormone that helps convert sugars from food into energy the body can use or store for later.  ""When you have diabetes, your body either doesn’t make insulin or doesn’t use its insulin well, causing your blood sugar to rise,"" according to the CDC. ""High blood sugar levels can cause serious health problems over time."" When a person has Type 1 diabetes, the body can’t make insulin, and he or she will need to take insulin every day. With Type 2 diabetes, your body doesn’t use insulin well.  ""Losing weight, eating well and exercising can help you manage the disease,"" according to the Mayo Clinic. ""If diet and exercise aren't enough to manage your blood sugar, you may also need diabetes medications or insulin therapy."" About 30 million Americans have diabetes, and about 31% take insulin to manage the condition, according to the Commonwealth Fund, a private U.S. foundation whose stated purpose is to ""promote a high-performing health care system that achieves better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency…"" According to the American Diabetes Association, those with diabetes account for $1 of every $4 spent on healthcare in the United States. Let’s start with some statistics that underline how high costs are in the U.S.  According to an April 2020 report from the American Action Forum, a conservative think tank based in Washington, D.C., the average list price of insulin increased 11% annually from 2001 to 2018, with average annual per capita insulin costs now nearing $6,000.  According to an October 2021 report from the Health Care Cost Institute, an independent nonprofit that studies health care prices, in its data sample the average monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin in 2019 was $82. And ""among the 8.7% of individuals in the highest spending category, the median monthly out-of-pocket spending on insulin was $315."" The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says Americans pay 10 times what people in other developed countries pay. Meanwhile, a January 2021 Forbes article reported that net costs of insulin to pharmacy benefit managers and payers have decreased in recent years because of steep rebates, but the savings very often have not been passed through to patients.  The bottom line: Americans pay a high cost for insulin – far higher than in other countries. But in her claim, Baldwin pinned the blame on the drug companies, when there are many factors involved in pricing and many points where prices – and profits – can be increased.  When we asked Baldwin’s office for backup for the claim, it pointed us to several reports and articles on insulin costs and affordability and a 2021 Senate committee report on what is behind it. The bipartisan staff report from the Senate Finance Committee noted that ""(insulin) manufacturers are retaining more revenue from insulin than in the 2000s,"" and that ""the amount of revenue pharmaceutical manufacturers are retaining from insulin has risen."" ""Insulin manufacturers compete fiercely, using rebates as bargaining chips to receive preferred formulary placement for their products and to block competition,"" the Senate report reads.  ""The companies undertake these bidding wars to maximize revenue and capture — or maintain — market share. Furthermore, in some cases the investigation found that while insulin manufacturers closely monitor their competitors’ pricing actions when determining their own list prices over time, there were multiple instances of companies increasing prices in lockstep with competitors."" So, that supports Baldwin’s claim. But others note that’s not the full picture. Dr. Jing Luo, assistant professor of Medicine at the Center for Pharmaceutical Policy and Prescribing at the University of Pittsburgh, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, ""There was a time when list prices for insulin rose at a rapid clip…on the order of 30% per year. Those price increases came from the manufacturers themselves."" Luo, whose research focuses on prescription drug use, pricing and policy, especially for medicines treating chronic diseases such as diabetes, also noted: ""In recent years we have noticed that the list price changes are not as dramatic as they had been previously. This is probably due to much higher public scrutiny."" Luo, in a Dec. 10, 2021 WBUR radio article said the limited number of TextEditor manufacturers in the U.S. are part of the equation. ""When you have a setting where there (are) only a few suppliers, but the demand for the medication is quite great,"" he told WBUR, ""it results in a situation where manufacturers can raise their prices without much blowback."" As to Baldwin’s claim, he said it is ""a simplification of the complex system we have that allows drug manufacturers to set whatever price they desire."" Karen Van Nuys, executive director of Value of Life Sciences Innovation at the University of Southern California, said in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin that big drug corporations often get the blame for rising insulin prices, but their research shows ""they are actually not the culprits in this case."" ""The amount manufacturers have been receiving per 100mL of insulin has actually been declining steadily over the last several years,"" Van Nuys said. ""What has been increasing is the amount of money drug distribution intermediaries — pharmacies, pharmacy benefit managers, health plans and wholesalers — have been pocketing."" Insulin is measured in International Units (units); most insulin is U-100, which means that 100 units of insulin are equal to 1 mL. Baldwin said ""the price of insulin has been jacked up by Big Drug Corporations."" There is no question that U.S. consumers pay more than those in other countries. And there is strong evidence that drug company profits are a key factor in the higher costs. But experts note that there are other factors involved – and other steps along the way where profits are taken. And those entities also play a role in the higher costs. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A363880>],/factchecks/2022/apr/08/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-pins-blame-high-insulin-prices-big-drug-co/
