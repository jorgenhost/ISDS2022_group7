Mitt Romney says half of students can't get a job out of college
","
Secretly recorded video of Mitt Romney grabbed attention on Sept. 17, 2012, primarily for his claim that 47 percent of Americans ""believe they are victims"" entitled to government help.

But there’s more to the video snippets of Romney speaking privately to big Florida donors in Boca Raton. As the Republican presidential candidate explained his approach to wooing independent voters, he reeled off a series of statistics about the disappointing economy. 
We’re checking several statements from Romney’s remarks on May 17, 2012, but here we’re asking whether, ""Fifty percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job.""

 Fifty percent of kids

Romney has made similar remarks on the campaign trail before, and his campaign has pointed us to articles by the Associated Press and Time.com that each address the bleak job market for 2012 college graduates.

The key piece of evidence is from the Associated Press article, ""In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed."" It’s based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs.

Here’s how the AP summarized the findings:

""A weak labor market already has left half of young college graduates either jobless or underemployed in positions that don't fully use their skills and knowledge. Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs – waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example – and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans. ...

""About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed. … Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year.""

Rather than roughly half of recent college grads not being able to find a job, the reality is that about 50 percent of recent college graduates are either unemployed or employed in jobs that aren’t commensurate with their degree. Of this 50 percent figure, about half are unemployed, and about half are in jobs that don’t require a college degree.

In August, PolitiFact checked with Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research. Sum agreed with our analysis.

Romney would have been more accurate if he had phrased his claim the way he did on other occasions, when he said ""half the kids coming out of college this year … can't find a job, or a job that's consistent with a college degree.""

We also think there’s an additional piece of context worth mentioning. Viewers shouldn’t compare this 50 percent rate to the more familiar unemployment rate, which is currently at 8.5 percent. The reality is that even in strong economic times, a sizable percentage of recent college grads is either unemployed or employed in jobs below their abilities.

According to the AP, the record low was still pretty high at 41 percent, in 2000 -- ""before the dot-com bust erased job gains for college graduates in the telecommunications and (information technology) fields."" That’s far higher than the more familiar unemployment statistic for the overall population ever gets.

While Romney glossed over details when he spoke with donors, painting a darker picture than supported by the research, he did get the tone right: At 53.6 percent, the number of college graduates unemployed or underemployed is the highest it’s been in at least 11 years.

 Our ruling

Romney told campaign donors that ""50 percent of kids coming out of school can't get a job."" He missed a key qualifier -- according to the research, about a quarter of recent college grads literally can’t find a job, while another quarter have found a job, but one that doesn’t require a college degree. Still, the research shows the employment picture for college grads is grimmer than at any time in more than a decade.

Romney repeats claim that Obama promised unemployment would not exceed 8 percent
","
Grainy video of Mitt Romney talking to big-dollar donors in Florida has the political world in a tizzy.

Romney’s remarks in the secretly recorded video that 47 percent of Americans believe they are victims entitled to government help prompted a swift response from the Barack Obama campaign and a late-night explanation from Romney himself.

We’ll be checking several claims from Romney’s remarks at the May 17, 2012, fundraiser in Boca Raton, Fla. Here we’ll examine one we’ve heard before. It was tucked into Romney’s description of how he can win over voters who supported Obama four years ago but are disappointed now.

""Those people that we have to get, they want to believe they did the right thing but he just wasn't up to the task. They love the phrase that he's ‘over his head.’ … The best success I have at speaking with those people is saying, you know, the president has been a disappointment. He told you he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent. Hasn't been below 8 percent since,"" Romney said.

Did Obama promise to keep unemployment below 8 percent? Not exactly.

 Projection or promise?
   
The source for Romney’s statement -- and others like it -- is a Jan. 9, 2009, report called ""The Job Impact of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Plan"" from Christina Romer, then chairwoman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and Jared Bernstein, the vice president's top economic adviser.
       
Their report projected that the economic stimulus plan would create 3 to 4 million jobs by the end of 2010. The report also included a chart predicting unemployment rates with and without the stimulus. Without the stimulus (the baseline), unemployment was projected to hit about 8.5 percent in 2009 and then continue rising to a peak of about 9 percent in 2010. With the stimulus, they predicted the unemployment rate would peak at just under 8 percent in 2009.
       
The important word here is projection. The economic analysis wasn’t a promise, it was an educated assessment of how events might unfold. And it came with heavy disclaimers.
       
""It should be understood that all of the estimates presented in this memo are subject to significant margins of error,"" the report states. ""There is the more fundamental uncertainty that comes with any estimate of the effects of a program. Our estimates of economic relationships and rules of thumb are derived from historical experience and so will not apply exactly in any given episode. Furthermore, the uncertainty is surely higher than normal now because the current recession is unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""
       
There's also a footnote that goes along with the chart stating: ""Forecasts of the unemployment rate without the recovery plan vary substantially. Some private forecasters anticipate unemployment rates as high as 11% in the absence of action.""

Of course, we now know the unemployment rate did exceed 8 percent. It peaked at just over 10 percent in early 2010 and has decreased very slowly. In August 2012, it was 8.1 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Our ruling

Romney told donors he could win over wavering voters by reminding them that Obama said ""he'd keep unemployment below 8 percent.""

Obama didn’t say that. Rather, his Council of Economic Advisers predicted that the stimulus would hold it to that level. Their report included heavy disclaimers that the projections had ""significant margins of error"" and a high degree of uncertainty due to a recession that is ""unusual both in its fundamental causes and its severity.""

The sub-8 percent prediction did not hold true, but it’s still incorrect to characterize it as a promise or guarantee.

Barrow gets flak for vote that funded study of ants
","
Could Congressman John Barrow’s re-election chances come down to, of all things, ants?

The Georgia Democrat recently released a television commercial portraying himself as a fighter against out-of-control spending in Washington. The National Republican Congressional Committee attempted to undercut Barrow’s efforts with a claim it says proves he’s no fiscal watchdog.

""Barrow left taxpayers on the hook for $950k study on genetic makeup of ants,"" read the headline of an article on the NRCC’s website.

The article claimed Barrow voted for legislation in 2009 that included sending $500,000 to Arizona State University to study the genetic makeup of ants to determine distinctive roles in ant colonies; $450,000 went to the University of Arizona to study the division of labor in ant colonies.

""Georgia families know that in order to get rid of wasteful spending they need to get rid of John Barrow,"" NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek wrote.

The Republicans’ larger point about this is they want to link Barrow with President Barack Obama, who is portrayed by the GOP as a big-spending liberal.

""Congressman John Barrow has supported [Obama’s] liberal spending agenda every step of the way,"" Bozek told PolitiFact Georgia. ""His claims [otherwise] don’t pass the smell test.""

Republicans believe they have a good opportunity to defeat the four-term incumbent in November after the lines in the east Georgia congressional district he represents were redrawn. The new 12th Congressional District no longer includes Savannah, a traditional stronghold for Democrats. A 2011 Atlanta Journal-Constitution analysis found the district shifted from a 2 percent Democratic advantage to a 20-point Republican lean. Barrow is the only white Democrat in the House who represents a congressional district in the Deep South.

Barrow has tried to portray himself as a moderate Democrat. His congressional website includes an email address for people to send ideas to ""fix Washington,"" saying, for example, that the federal government spends billions of dollars on vehicles it doesn’t need. Barrow did not attend the recent Democratic National Convention. He claims to have voted 54 percent of the time with House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Republican from Virginia. In a recent TV ad, Barrow said he voted against funding for a lobster institute, holding one of the sea creatures for effect.

So why would a congressman from Georgia vote to spend federal funds for researchers from Arizona to study ants? The answer lies in one of the largest government spending measures in U.S. history.

Shortly after Obama became president in 2009, House Democrats took up legislation aimed at stabilizing the U.S. economy. The bill was called the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act. It was commonly known as the economic stimulus. It entailed $787 billion in federal spending on infrastructure projects, unemployment benefits, expanded medical benefits and other government programs. The bill passed the then-Democratic-led House of Representatives by a 246-183 vote. Barrow voted in favor of the program. Not one Republican voted for the bill.

Months later, Republicans began blasting the stimulus. U.S. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, who voted against the stimulus, complained about money funded for the ant research in his home state.

""I had no idea that so much expertise concerning ants resided in the major universities of my state,"" McCain quipped at a news conference. ""I must say, I say that with an element of pride -- but I'm not sure that it is deserving of these taxpayer dollars.""

Arizona State officials said the research helps further knowledge of evolution and societal behavior, which sheds light on understanding humans. A University of Arizona official said the research would help scientists learn more about how ants share scarce resources.

""You don't think of it every day, but ants are really good at division of labor,"" Leslie Tolbert, the UA vice president for research, said in The Arizona Daily Star.

Barrow spokesman Richard Carbo defended the congressman’s vote on the stimulus. He said the 407-page bill did not include references to ants or research to study the insects. The money came from $2.5 billion through the National Science Foundation to be spent on research that was unspecified in the bill. Carbo said it is disingenuous for the NRCC to say Barrow supported that amount of money for the research.

""To say [Barrow] voted for it is inaccurate and false,"" Carbo told us. ""If you look at the entire bill, there’s no mention of ants.""

Carbo said some Republicans from the Georgia Legislature have credited the package with helping the economy in this state. Bozek countered that Barrow’s support for the bill disappeared after the NRCC publicized the money for ant research. She cited a Sept. 11 report in The Savannah Morning News that Barrow recently removed a sentence from his campaign biography that he stood with Obama in support of the stimulus act.

But is it fair to bash Barrow for voting in favor of the stimulus when it didn’t include any information that some funds would ultimately be spent on ant colony research? Bozek said the congressman should have known the stimulus would result in ""wasteful spending.""

""John Barrow continues to try to and pass the buck for his failed leadership that cost Georgia taxpayers dearly,"" Bozek said. ""While Barrow tries to hide the facts by deleting mentions of the failed stimulus from his website, Georgia taxpayers are left footing the bill for his wasteful stimulus plan.""

OK, so where does this leave us? Barrow did vote for the stimulus bill. It did not mention anything, however, about ant research, but some of the funds were used for such purposes. The NRCC headline is technically accurate, but it omits some important information to fully understand this issue. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B30D80>],/factchecks/2012/sep/18/national-republican-congressional-committee/barrow-gets-flak-vote-funded-study-ants/

Jeanne Shaheen cites poor job creation in New Hampshire's southern neighbor under Romney
","
As political commentators debated whether the Democratic National Convention would give President Barack Obama a significant ""bump"" in the race for the White House, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen indicated Obama at least has Granite Staters’ support.

The former governor of New Hampshire, identified as a ""longtime friend and ally"" of Clinton, was a guest on a segment of MSNBC’s The Daily Rundown called ""The Clinton Contribution"" leading up to the former president’s speech in Charlotte on Sept. 5.

During the three-minute spot, Shaheen predicted that Clinton would show how Obama best identifies with middle America’s concerns, and discussed the close 2012 presidential race in her swing state.

""This election is close everywhere and I think New Hampshire reflects that,"" Shaheen said. ""But the fact that Barack Obama is still leading slightly in New Hampshire despite the fact that -- that Mitt Romney has a home there, that he was governor of Massachusetts, our neighboring state, I think is a reflection of people’s remembering what Romney did in Massachusetts. You know, when he was governor, Massachusetts was 47th in job creation, so we need better than that in a president.""

PolitiFact has had heard this claim about Bay State job creation under Romney more than once.

In fact, the day before Shaheen cited the statistic, PolitiFact gave Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, the Democrat who succeeded Romney in 2006, a Half True for using it in his speech at the convention.

PolitiFact New Hampshire reached out to Shaheen about the claim. Spokesperson Faryl Ury cited a Market Watch story from February 2010 that cites U.S. Labor Department statistics showing Massachusetts ranked fourth from last in the country in jobs growth from January 2003 to January 2007 -- Romney’s time in office.

But the article failed to present any new data that would challenge what has been deemed a partially accurate Democratic talking point for more than a year.
Here’s a quick summary: PolitiFact handed Obama’s campaign adviser David Axelrod a Half True for the same claim in June 2011. And nearly a year later, Axelrod earned another Half True for repeating it.

Democrats have repeated the statement so many times, the Romney campaign came up with a counterattack -- that Massachusetts under Romney initially ranked last among states in job growth, but by the end of his governorship, ""we were in the middle of the pack."" That got a Half True as well.

PolitiFact’s usual approach is to look at the claim in two parts: First, are the numbers correct, and second, how much was the change because of Romney's policies?

We used state-level statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source of employment data, specifically figures for non-farm jobs, seasonally adjusted. And because the Massachusetts governor takes office in early January, we used the data for December of each year as a baseline.

From December 2002 to December 2006, Massachusetts ranked 47th out of 50 states (not including the District of Columbia) in job growth. (We calculated that by using the number of jobs at the beginning and end of the period for each state to determine the percentage change and then ranking the states.) Only Ohio, Louisiana and Michigan fared worse.

So the number is correct.

But does Romney deserve credit for the job situation? This is an issue we've addressed often at PolitiFact with governors from many states. Economists have consistently told us that policies of a governor have a relatively small impact on a state's economy.

For instance, the country was coming out of a recession when Romney took office. And it's likely that Massachusetts emerged more slowly from that recession because its pre-recession numbers were disproportionately inflated by the technology bubble, said Michael Widmer, president of the Massachusetts Taxpayers Foundation, an independent group that analyzes fiscal trends in the state. A lot of those tech jobs never came back.

Widmer warned us when we first looked at Axelrod’s 47th-in-the-nation claim in June 2011 not to put too much stock in any governor's influence over their state's rate of job growth. The ability for governors to manage the state economy is vastly overrated, Widmer said. States are tied to larger economic forces, he added, and governors often claim too much credit when things are going well and no blame when things are going poorly.

Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution, echoed that point.

""Presidents, governors, and mayors can have an impact on job creation during their terms in office,"" he said. ""Almost always, however, the impact is small in relation to the effects of events and trends over which elected officials have little control, especially in their first few years on the job. A recession that is underway or begins soon after a president or governor takes office is in no way the fault of the new officeholder. The flip side is that chief executives cannot claim much credit for a strong economic recovery that begins shortly before or after they take the oath of office. The conditions that made the recovery possible were already present when their term in office began. The executive’s policies may have speeded or slowed the recovery around the margins, but the conditions that caused the recovery to begin were already present before the oath of office was administered.""

(As we’ve noted before, Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

Our ruling

It’s correct that Massachusetts ranked 47th of 50 in job creation on Romney’s watch.

However, Shaheen -- like Democrats before her and the Romney camp in its rebuttal -- exaggerates Romney’s influence on the state job market.

Governors simply don't have that much impact. Shaheen gets a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A480440>],/factchecks/2012/sep/17/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-cites-poor-job-creation-new-hampshi/

Rick Scott brags about Florida's declining unemployment rate
","
The competitive businessman in Gov. Rick Scott wants Florida to be No. 1 for jobs.

By most measures it’s not, and in at least one area it’s dead last.

But what about its declining unemployment rate?

Scott often points to this measure as evidence the state is headed in the right direction. In August, when monthly jobs numbers showed the state lost 3,300 jobs and the unemployment rate ticked up to 8.8 percent, Scott’s office found something nice to trumpet: Over the past 20 months (when Scott took office), the unemployment rate fell faster in Florida than in any other state.

Scott repeated the claim a month later at a Sept. 13, 2012, board meeting of Enterprise Florida, the official economic development organization of the state of Florida.

""We have every reason to brag about what’s going on in our state,"" he said. ""If you look at the fastest drop in unemployment, it’s down 2.3 (percentage points) in the last 20 months.""

We’ve heard conflicting reports about Florida’s job creation record, so Scott’s argument that the state’s falling unemployment rate is brag-worthy piqued our interest.

His math is right. Since December 2010, the month before he took office, it has fallen 2.3 points to 8.8 percent in July, which is still above the national August unemployment rate of 8.1 percent.

Is such a feat really good for Florida, though?

Economists don’t share Scott’s sunny perspective. Cheering the decline overlooks the real reason for it: a labor force contracted by the departure of thousands of workers, many of whom simply gave up looking for work.

""What we’re seeing is that our participation in the labor force is declining,"" said Amy Baker, the Florida Legislature’s top economist, at a Sept. 12, 2012, meeting. ""And because it’s declining, that’s really leading to much of the improvement -- in the month of July, about 91 percent of the improvement -- in the unemployment rate.""

A September 2012 report by Baker’s team at the Office of Economic and Demographic Research, highlighted the same trend: dropping unemployment rate caused not by job creation, but almost exclusively by a shrinking workforce. People tend to leave the labor force when they become discouraged with the process of trying to find work.

Florida ranks last in the nation when it comes to long-term unemployment, so economists say the shrinking labor force is a natural result. More than half of the 816,000 jobless people in Florida have been looking for work for six months or more, a new national record, according to a recent Florida International University study.

""The conditions of the labor market have been dire for so long that many people have dropped out of the labor force,"" reads the FIU report, which highlights several areas where Florida’s recovery is lagging the national pace. ""Labor force participation rates keep plummeting even though we are three years into the recovery.""

Absent the labor pool’s contraction, the unemployment rate would be 9.8 percent, Baker’s report found. A report from Scott's Department of Economic Opportunity found that if the state's 94,100 discouraged workers were added to the unemployment rolls, the jobless rate would be 9.7 percent.

That’s because Florida’s job growth rate has been mediocre when compared to other states. The state has added 69,900 jobs in the last 12 months, a growth rate of less than 1 percent. This growth is slower than the national pace; Florida ranks 28th in the nation.

For comparison, high-growth states like California and Texas have created 365,000 jobs and 222,500 jobs, respectively, over the same period. California and Texas are two of 13 states currently growing jobs twice as fast as Florida.

It's not always a good sign when a state sees a rapid decline in the unemployment rate, said Sean Snaith, an economist with the University of Central Florida. 
""You need strong economic growth to bring down rapidly the unemployment rate in the way we want to see it decline, and we haven’t seen that strong economic growth,"" he said. ""This is the contradiction in the unemployment rate: Just because it’s going down, doesn’t mean it’s good news.""

We reached out to Scott’s press office and a spokesperson referred us to the Department of Economic Opportunity. A DEO spokesperson said the workforce is shrinking due to a high population of retirees and a large number of seasonal workers. When pressed for more specific figures to back up those claims, the spokesperson declined to answer and ultimately referred us to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Our ruling

Scott reassured Florida’s economic development leaders, ""We have every reason to brag about what’s going on in our state.""

We found his example of the plummeting unemployment rate over 20 months is not something to tout.

Experts say the reasons behind the drop are mostly grim: Thousands of discouraged workers have given up on finding work in Florida.

The shrinking workforce can be attributed to a number of factors, but the fact that Florida is last in the nation when it comes to long-term unemployment can’t be ignored. A major factor in the drop in unemployment is the exodus of people who have simply given up looking for work. Job creation, meanwhile, has been below-average.

So is the unemployment rate decline a positive economic sign for Florida? We say Mostly False.

Is Barack Obama right on 'guaranteed benefits' under Medicare?
","
A new ad from President Barack Obama emphasizes a favorite Democratic talking point -- that Medicare currently has ""guaranteed benefits"" that could be taken away if Mitt Romney wins the presidency. 
In the ad, a narrator says, ""The new AARP Voter Guide is out with facts you need on Medicare. Fact: Barack Obama will protect your guaranteed benefits and will not allow Medicare to become a voucher program. Fact: Mitt Romney would take away Medicare as guaranteed benefits and instead give future retirees ‘premium support’ or vouchers. AARP opposes that plan and non-partisan analysts say it could raise seniors' costs up to $6,400 a year."" 
But are there ""guaranteed benefits"" for Medicare today? And if so, would they be at risk if Romney wins? A lot of it depends on how you define these words. 
What guarantees exist under Medicare today? 
Probably the clearest -- and least controversial -- explanation of how Medicare is a guarantee is that once you turn 65, you get Medicare, no questions asked. 
That wasn’t always the case. Before Medicare and Medicaid were established in 1965, health coverage for seniors was far from guaranteed. When people retired, they often lost coverage they had from their former employer and couldn’t afford a new plan. (For more on the pre-Medicare era, including statistics, see our article, ""Were the early 1960s a golden age for health care?"") 
The Obama campaign goes further. It argues that ""guaranteed benefits"" refers to ""all the benefits that Medicare is required to cover."" Today, Medicare is structured as a defined-benefit plan rather than a defined-contribution plan. That means it specifies the benefits provided, rather than letting one’s benefits depend on the amount of money they paid into the system. 
""As a system of defined benefits, Medicare does guarantee those benefits,"" said Paul Starr, a specialist on health care reform at Princeton University. ""The government has a responsibility for them that it would not have in a defined-contribution scheme. There are a host of legal rights in regard to providers that are also associated with those guaranteed benefits. All that goes away with the shift to defined contribution."" 
Is there a complete guarantee of benefits? 
No, Medicare benefits aren’t guaranteed in every sense. 
First, while the federal government guarantees that you will be served by Medicare once you turn 65, it doesn’t guarantee that you’ll get every possible service or treatment paid for. Indeed, an entire industry sector -- Medigap insurance plans -- has emerged to pay for the procedures that Medicare doesn’t cover. This is particularly true for the coverage for newly emergent technologies and treatments. 
And just because something is covered today doesn’t mean it will be covered indefinitely, or at the same percentage of the cost. 
Congress and the president can -- and do -- change the benefit rules for Medicare. In 1988, for example, Congress enacted the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, adding a bevy of benefits, including a prescription drug benefit and a catastrophic-care benefit, said Robert Moffit, a health care specialist at the conservative Heritage Foundation. The following year, Congress repealed it. 
Obama’s own health care law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, doesn’t maintain the status quo indefinitely. While we have previously said that the Romney campaign is exaggerating when it criticizes Obama for cutting Medicare, the Romney campaign isn’t wrong that changesare going to be made. The fact that Obama would reduce Medicare reimbursement to certain Medicare providers -- likely resulting in the elimination or reduction of some benefits -- is proof positive that Medicare is not a fixed, unchangeable program. 
Obama’s law also creates the Independent Payment Advisory Board, a 15-member, appointed panel that is charged with identifying Medicare savings. While PolitiFact has in the past been critical of Republican exaggerations about what the board would do, the board could force certain changes in the Medicare program. Any such future changes would undermine the notion that Medicare has ""guaranteed benefits."" 
""If you are promised a benefit but find trouble accessing physicians or home care or long-term-care providers to provide that service, have your benefits been changed or compromised?"" said Gail Wilensky, a former health care official under President George H.W. Bush. ""I think a reasonable person could say yes."" 
Another important factor that could infringe on any Medicare ""guarantee"" is the program’s fiscal challenges. 
According to Medicare’s actuary, the trust fund for Medicare Part A -- the part of the program that pays for hospital care -- will run out in 2024 if the Obama law’s cuts remain on the books, or in 2016 if the cuts are rescinded (the course Romney has said he wants to follow). So unless something is done to change the program’s fiscal balance, Medicare would spend down its reserves for hospital payments within eight to 16 years. 
""If you define guarantee benefit as simply receiving a Medicare card, then that only lasts until the money runs out,"" said Joshua Archambault, a former Romney aide who is now a health care policy specialist at the free-market Pioneer Institute. ""So I guess the president can make that claim until 2016 … but then he loses it."" 
Even health care experts who are supportive of Obama’s law do acknowledge that the concept of a Medicare ""guarantee"" may be too strongly worded. 
""So long as the law is in place, people who meet specified eligibility requirements are assured specified benefits,"" said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Still, ""nothing in the statutes is ‘guaranteed,’ because Congress always has the option of changing the law."" 
Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who has advised both Obama and Romney on health care reform, agreed. ""Under today's system, you have a guaranteed benefit, but one that is subject to political risk,"" he said. 
How Romney would change Medicare 
As for Romney’s plan, it’s important to note that it has not been been set out in full detail, and it hasn’t been analyzed by the Congressional Budget Office. But we’ll explain it as best we can. 
Romney has said his plan would be close to the most recent one offered by his running mate, Paul Ryan. For people who are now under age 55, Medicare would no longer pay for seniors’ health care bills directly. Instead, the government would offer future beneficiaries fixed payments -- voucher-like credits -- that could go toward private plans. Beneficiaries could use those credits to select a traditional Medicare plan or a private plan from a competitive marketplace, or exchange, that complies with standards set by the government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based on the second least-expensive plan available. 
We know that the Romney plan, like the status quo, would preserve the guarantee that people will start receiving coverage under a federal health care program when they turn 65. (The age threshold would gradually rise to 67 by 2034.) 
Less clear is whether the operational changes Romney would make would undermine the guarantee of benefits under Medicare. The Romney campaign argues that not only would be traditional Medicare be a choice, but that private plan offerings must provide coverage at least comparable to what Medicare provides today, and that those plans would be Medicare-approved. 
However, since CBO hasn’t weighed in, we don’t know whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, especially over the longer term. 
The Obama campaign argues that ""Romney has said that under his voucher system, plans have to offer coverage that is ‘comparable’ to Medicare today"" -- a term they believe falls short of a guarantee of specific benefits. 
But Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and a domestic policy staffer on health-care issues for President George W. Bush, says that’s a smokescreen. The Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services ""establishes the benefits covered by Medicare each year, and the private insurers in Medicare Advantage and Part D, the drug benefit, are required to cover at least that minimum benefit or its actuarial equivalent. That's exactly the Romney proposal."" 
Under the most recent plan, Levin said, ""seniors are guaranteed at least one and generally two options that provide comprehensive coverage for no greater out-of-pocket costs than they have now."" 
Levin also disputes the notion that the Romney plan is a pure defined-contribution plan. ""The Romney approach is a hybrid of defined benefit and defined contribution,"" he said. ""The minimum benefit is set by the government, and all competing insurers must meet it, but the government payment is determined by competitive bidding among those insurers to see how cheaply they can provide at least that minimum benefit."" 
The most recent Republican plans have lessened the likelihood that Medicare’s payment will fall behind the actual rise in health care costs, experts say, but given the limited details, there’s still some uncertainty on this front. 
Under the Romney plan, MIT’s Gruber said, you have the same political risk of a broken guarantee as you have today, but that guarantee is compounded by health spending risk. ""As health spending rises faster than your voucher, you are in trouble,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
In the ad, Obama said he ""will protect your guaranteed benefits"" in Medicare, while ""Mitt Romney would take away Medicare as guaranteed benefits."" 
Obama exaggerates when he refers to ""guaranteed"" Medicare benefits under today’s system. Currently, Medicare does ""guarantee"" a form of health coverage for seniors and, in the shorter term, guarantees specific benefits. But Medicare doesn’t cover everything, and Congress and the president can change what is covered, and will be forced to do so when fiscal pressures hit. 
Meanwhile, it’s plausible that the Romney plan could provide less of a ""guarantee"" than Medicare currently does, but we found sharp disagreement between supporters and opponents of Romney’s Medicare plan on that point. This disagreement is hard to resolve given the shortage of information Romney has so far provided.

Thompson says aide wasn’t representing campaign in email criticizing sexual orientation of Baldwin
","
Hours before U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin of Madison gave the most important speech of her political career, to the Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, N.C., a disparaging email made the rounds.

Baldwin is facing former Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson in a bid for a key open U.S. Senate seat, the one now held by Democrat Herb Kohl.

The email criticized Baldwin, who had said that her Sept. 6, 2012, convention speech would focus on ""heartland values.""

Here’s the email message:

""Yesterday, Madison-Liberal Tammy Baldwin cited ""heartland values"" as the topic for her prime time speech to the DNC tomorrow night.  
Clearly, there's no one better positioned to talk ""heartland values"" than Tammy""

The email included a link to a YouTube videoand then added these words: ""A primer of her values---note event, and enjoy.""

The video is of Baldwin, who would be the first openly gay member of the U.S. Senate, dancing on stage with a costumed band at a 2010 gay pride event in Madison.

The email -- and several similar tweets  -- were sent to more than a dozen conservative political contacts, including bloggers and those in the media, by Brian Nemoir, senior adviser/communications for the Thompson campaign.

One of the recipients forwarded the email to WisPolitics.com, which wrote the first story on the matter and called the messages""a negative hit from Tommy Thompson’s campaign.""The tweets were sent from Nemoir’s personal account, according to the Wisconsin State Journal.That account has since added privacy settings.

The emails drew a far broader audience, and quickly drew attention -- and criticism -- since it was the first time Baldwin’s sexual orientation had been made an issue in the contentious campaign.

In an email to reporters, another Thompson aide, Darrin Schmitz, wrote that Nemoir ""acted on his own"" and ""he was not representing the Thompson campaign in this matter.""

Is that accurate?

Let’s pause for a quick note: When we examine claims from campaign spokespersons, we typically attribute the statement to the candidate. After all, that is what spokespersons are hired to do -- speak for the candidate. We will do that here when evaluating the statement issued by Schmitz, who like Nemoir, has frequently spoken to the media on behalf of the campaign.

Five days after the emails were sent, Thompson told reporters after an appearance in Milwaukee:""I thought it was a mistake, I'm sorry, and he's apologized, I believe. He shouldn't have done it.""

Thompson also said a person's sexual orientation is ""absolutely not an issue"" in the race.

After the email was made public, Nemoir’s role with the campaign changed, and he was replaced as the campaign’s spokesman, according to Thompson.

But what about that not-part-of-the-campaign claim about the email?

When asked to back up that position, Schmitz said Nemoir’s email was an ""unauthorized statement.""

""As you well know, this is not the first time an employee of any business, organization, campaign or media outlet has shared personal thoughts through a work email,"" Schmitz said in an email.

Maybe so, but some things just don’t add up.

In the past, most of Nemoir’s correspondence with reporters had been through his email address with his consulting firm, Full Impact Communications. This email was sent from his  email account with the Thompson campaign.

The email contained Nemoir’s name and listed his then-position with the campaign: senior adviser/communications. It also contained the web address for the Thompson campaign.

It certainly appeared official.

What’s more, it arrived a key political moment in the campaign.

It was sent out hours in advance of Baldwin’s convention speech, and was tied directly to the theme of that speech ""heartland values."" Although the email text didn’t note her sexual orientation in depth, the link made the message was clear: Baldwin does not represent ""heartland values"" because she is gay.

""This sounds like a good/bad cop routine. An aide makes an attack through the campaign but the organization disavows the attack,"" said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. ""This can be a very effective strategy if the media pick up the attack.""

West added that ""making an issue of someone's sexuality is not a casual decision. Campaigns think very carefully about the up and downside of that."" He likened the message to ""lobbing a nuclear bomb into a meadow.""

Our rating

A Thompson consultant said the campaign was not responsible for an email that criticized Baldwin as not representing ""heartland values.""

But the email came from the campaign’s chief spokesman on a campaign account at a key political moment in the campaign. It was sent to conservative bloggers and others. It was clearly meant to draw attention to the video of Baldwin’s appearance at the gay pride event.

The average reader of the email got the message loud and clear: Thompson’s campaign was criticizing Baldwin.

Schmitz’s statement is false, and it’s ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970AA240>],/factchecks/2012/sep/17/tommy-thompson/thompson-says-aide-wasnt-representing-campaign-ema/
"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Housing', 'Income', 'Taxes', 'Menendez Facts']","
Bloggers say Bob Menendez voted for a new 3.8% tax on the sale of homes
","
A debunked claim making the rounds on the chain e-mail circuit for years has been revitalized to attack a New Jersey Democrat.

A blog called ""Menendez Facts"" falls far short of the truth in a post claiming U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez ""voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%.""

""In 2010 Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a brand-new tax on the sale of homes. Sen. Bob Menendez voted for this during one of the most horrific housing markets in recent history. When families are struggling to sell their homes, as housing prices plunge Sen. Bob Menendez voted to take even more money from families struggling to sell their homes,"" the Sept. 4 blog post says.

The post includes a chart that lists how much this new tax would cost homeowners. Sell your home for $200,000? The chart claims you would pay $7,600 in taxes.

Sell your home for $500,000? That’ll cost you $19,000 in taxes, according to the chart.

But that’s simply false.

Menendez Facts acknowledged in an e-mail that we were fact-checking this claim and said they would update their blog post this week, but did not say how.

Versions of this home sales tax claim have been checked by PolitiFact and other nonpartisan fact-checking groups several times before. The claim has been roundly declared as false and PolitiFact has rated it Pants on Fire.

Such claims stem from a provision included in the 2010 national health care overhaul.

On March 25, 2010, the Senate passed the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act, which was the second part of the health care bill.  

Menendez, who is running for re-election in November, voted in favor of that bill, which included a new tax on investment income for wealthy individuals that goes into effect in 2013.

The law created a 3.8 percent tax on investment income for individuals who have an adjusted gross income of more than $200,000 or couples with an adjusted gross income of more than $250,000. That investment income could include profits from real estate transactions.

PolitiFact National noted in a similar fact-check in July, that those high-income earners represent less than 5 percent of all taxpayers. Individuals or couples who make less than those income thresholds would not be subject to the tax.

But even if a couple earned more than those thresholds, the tax only applies to profits from the sale of a home, not the sales price itself, as the blog post claims.

Also, if the home being sold is your primary residence, the first $250,000 in profits for an individual, or the first $500,000 in profits for a couple, is excluded from the tax.

And for some perspective, the National Association of Realtors reported that the national median existing-home price in July was $187,300. No homeowner could make $250,000 in profit on the sale of that home and, therefore, would not pay the 3.8 percent tax.

Paul Brubaker, Menendez’s campaign communications director, said in an e-mail, ""Senator Menendez worked on behalf of New Jersey’s middle class families, and all Americans, to help provide them access to quality, affordable health care by helping to make the Affordable Care Act the law of the land. It is sad that, even though the U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the law, some falsehoods about the law persist ­– evidently with the help of the MenendezFacts.com web site."" 
Our ruling

A blog called Menendez Facts claimed that ""Sen. Bob Menendez voted to enact a new tax on the sale of homes of 3.8%.""

That’s a distortion of the truth.

Menendez voted in favor of a bill tied to the health care law that created a tax on investment income for high-income earners.

Though that investment income could include profits from real estate transactions, it is not a tax on the sales price of a home and it would not impact the vast majority of Americans.

Wealthy individuals who sell their home for a large profit may be subject to the tax, but the blog does not make that clear and suggests the tax applies to the sales price of homes, regardless of an individual’s income.

So again we set this ridiculous claim ablaze: Pants on Fire!

Josh Mandel claims Sherrod Brown's campaign attacked his military service
","
It’s insult time. Let’s start with this one -- that U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown’s actions were ""un-American."" That leads to another -- that Brown, the Democratic senator from Ohio, has stooped so outrageously, desperately low that he attacked the military service of his opponent, Marine Corps and Iraq War veteran Josh Mandel.

My gosh, you might say, is this a nasty campaign or what?

Well, yes. Still, to understand these related insults, you must follow some  twists, turns and contortions, the likes of which did not end with the Olympics in London. In an election year, gymnastics continue until the polls close.

The claim we are examining today is that Brown’s campaign attacked the service of  Mandel, a Republican who is currently Ohio’s treasurer -- and a Marine Corps reservist who served two tours in Iraq. 

Mandel’s campaign sent out a fund-raising email saying as much on Aug. 31 and referred to Brown using ""scummy smear tactics"" to attack Mandel’s military service. 

""It is outrageous for Sherrod Brown’s campaign to say that enlisted military service with infantry battalions in Iraq doesn’t prepare you for leadership… that risking your life in defense of your country somehow disqualifies you from serving your country back home,"" the email said.

The subject line on the email was ""Mandel Marine service under attack.""

Let’s take the episode chronologically:

On Aug. 24, 2012, Mandel and Brown were interviewed together at The Columbus Dispatch. The candidates were asked about the federal government’s auto industry bailout, which Brown supported. Mandel called one aspect of the bailout ""un-American."" 

He was speaking of the manner in which General Motors, with government money and input, agreed to guarantee the full pensions of unionized workers at Delphi Corp., a former GM subsidiary. Delphi’s salaried workers got no such guarantee. Many salaried Delphi workers will see dramatic cuts in their pensions, and they say back-room negotiations involving President Barack Obama’s administration and GM resulted in unequal treatment.

Meantime, as The Dispatch reported: ""In their first head-to-head meeting of this election season, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Josh Mandel described Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown as ""un-American.""

The newspaper quoted Mandel: ""I don’t toss around the word un-American very often — it’s a dangerous word to use. But stripping ... Delphi employees of their pensions with that vote — that is un-American."" 

The Plain Dealer, in an Aug. 26 interview, asked Mandel to elaborate on whether he thought Brown was anti-American, or whether he was strictly referring to the Delphi matter. 

""I think Sherrod Brown’s a proud American,"" Mandel said. ""Just because I served in the Marines and did a couple tours of Iraq doesn’t mean I love my country any more than he loves his country. We just have a different vision for where we want to take it, and different ideas for what we think grows an economy and creates jobs. And the thousands of Delphi employees who were depending on having pensions and were all of a sudden stripped of them are now baby boomers and senior citizens who are struggling to make ends meet.""

Brown’s campaign held a news conference Aug 30 in Columbus to denounce the ""un-American"" claim.  As reported by an NBC affiliate,  ""local veterans, including two retired Army Generals, denounced Mandel’s choice of words. Ret. Major General Dennis Laich said, ‘Having spent 35 years in the military, I have a sense of what un-American looks like in terms of words and deeds and I can tell you that the vote that Senator Brown took, in no way, represents an un-American act.’""

During that news conference, a reporter asked the retired generals if they thought Mandel’s use of his military service would work in earning votes from the military or veterans bloc. Here is Laich’s answer, which we got from news accounts, partial transcripts from the Brown and Mandel campaigns, and online video of the news conference:

""It’s not a matter of it working or not. The fact of the matter is that Josh Mandel has served in the military. We applaud that. As a matter of fact, Gen. (Sam) Kindred and I would both hope that thousands of other young Ohioans would choose to serve in the military. But the fact of the matter is, that the meaning that we’re trying to do today is not in Iraq or Afghanistan at the tactical level. It is at the national strategic level, its national security level, where Sen. Sherrod Brown is the veteran.""

Laich continued, saying, ""The experience that Josh Mandel had in the military is at the tactical level. Decisions that are made by those hundred Americans who serve in the United States Senate (are) at the strategic level and the national security level. We applaud it, we recognize it, and we wish that others would continue to serve or choose to serve. But the fact of the matter is that these are two different sets of criterion that are at play here and the experienced veteran in the wars on Capitol Hill is Sherrod Brown -- who has, by the way, I hate to disagree with my colleague here, but he characterized Senator Brown’s record for veterans and their families as outstanding, I characterize it as perfect.""

There you have it. Did you hear an attack on Mandel’s Marine Corps service? The Mandel campaign says it did. 

Travis Considine, Mandel’s communications director, told PolitiFact Ohio that Brown’s campaign ""is essentially attacking Josh’s military service by suggesting that because his time in the Marine Corps was spent at the ‘tactical level’ he is not as prepared to fight for Ohio’s veterans as Sherrod Brown, who they call ‘the experienced veteran in the wars on Capitol Hill.’ Their logic illustrates exactly what is wrong with Washington, the belief that career politician experience supersedes actual experience.""

That brings us back to the Mandel camp’s Aug. 31 fundraising email. The email did not quote Mandel directly. Rather, it included a statement from a Mandel supporter and fellow Marine. The email said:

""Did you see what fellow Marine Mark DePhillips wrote below about Sherrod Brown's campaign attacking Josh's Marine Corps service?  Take a look, and I bet you will be as disgusted as I was.""

The email asked supporters to help Mandel ""fight back and defend not only his own military service, but the honorable service of the thousands of brave men and women who risked everything to protect this great country."" It provided a link to a television commercial that Mandel wanted to air. The commercial begins with this line:

""Sherrod Brown’s cowardly attacks on Josh Mandel’s character are shameful. Just ask the Marines who put their lives on the line with him."" 

It’s not unusual to insult a political opponent. But attacking his military service is something else. 

Laich, however, said he did no such thing.  ""For someone to draw from those comments that I insulted his military service is a stretch,"" he told us in a telephone interview. ""You’d have to do some magical thinking there.""

He said that in the military, service members are tasked with different levels of duty: tactical, operational or strategic. Each is invaluable, he said, repeating his praise for Mandel’s military service. But each is different, he said.

Was Laich on firm ground here? We turned to military materials to see. It turns out that Laich’s descriptions are consistent with Marine Corps and Pentagon manuals, including the Department of Defense Dictionary of Military and Related Terms.

The strategic level refers to establishing national or multi-national objectives and developing resources to accomplish them. Think of this as the 20,000-foot view -- or in Washington, the duties of policy makers.  The operational level refers to the level at which military operations are planned and sustained. The tactical level is where battles and engagements are planned and executed. Says a Marine Corps manual called, simply,  Tactics: ""Winning in combat depends upon tactical leaders who can think creatively and act decisively.""

 And says a Marine Corps intelligence manual, which we mention because Mandel’s specialty in the Corps was intelligence:

""Tactical intelligence concerns itself primarily with the location, capabilities, and possible intentions of enemy units on the battlefield and with the tactical aspects of terrain and weather ... Marine Corps intelligence focuses on tactical intelligence, which is the level of intelligence Marines need, generate, and use most often.""

None of this sounded outrageous. 

Yet there is an element of truth in Mandel’s complaint. Though couched in laudatory phrases, Laich's remarks could be interpreted as dismissive. While Laich, speaking on behalf of Brown’s campaign, applauded Mandel for serving, he also distinguished Mandel’s experience at the tactical level from experience in the Senate. In order to praise Brown’s Senate service, he spoke of a Marine’s military service as not only requiring a different skill set, but also as subordinate to the skills in the United States Senate: ""The experience that Josh Mandel had in the military is at the tactical level. Decisions that are made by those hundred Americans who serve in the United States Senate (are) at the strategic level and the national security level.""

That said, there was no attempt to describe Mandel as someone who disobeyed orders or who was derelict in his duty or anything other than an exemplary Marine. 

And we don’t see, from reading the general’s remarks, that he ever conveyed the message that ""risking your life in defense of your country somehow disqualifies you from serving your country back home,"" as the email from Mandel’s camp implied.

Knowing those critical facts would give a different impression of the claim that Brown’s campaign attacked Mandel’s military service.

Gingrey: Medicare reform plan does not create voucher system
","
GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney’s decision to pick U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan as his running mate unleashed a flood of partisan debate over Medicare.

Georgia politicians are riding the rapids.

The Wisconsin congressman is the architect of a plan to overhaul Medicare that Democrats have widely attacked as a ""voucher system.""   

During an interview on CNN, Republican U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta used a more delicate term: ""premium support.""

""Premium support is not vouchers,"" the co-chairman of the House Republican doctors caucus said Aug. 14.

""A voucher would be, you hand money to a senior and say, ‘Hey, go find your health care,’ "" he said. ""This would be run by the Medicare trustees. … The money would stay there.""  

So which one is it? ""Premium support"" or a voucher plan?

Democrats have used the word ""voucher"" over the years to criticize Republican privatization proposals. Republicans don't like the word and try to avoid it

PolitiFact National recently gave President Barack Obama a Mostly True when he said that Romney and Ryan ""want to turn Medicare into a voucher system.""

Its inquiry started with the dictionary.

Merriam-Webster defines a voucher as ""a written affidavit or authorization ... a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures; a coupon issued by government to a parent or guardian to be used to fund a child's education in either a public or private school.""

""Premium support"" describes a concept that’s been kicking around since the mid-1990s.

Health policy experts Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution and Robert Reischauer, a former Congressional Budget Office director, defined the term in a 1995 study. Versions of premium support have appeared in other proposals since then.
   
Broadly speaking, these proposals would change Medicare from a program in which the government pays the health care provider for services directly to one in which the government designates money for a beneficiary to spend on an insurance plan.
   
The initial Ryan plan that used ""premium supports"" was released in early 2011. It was approved by the GOP-controlled House before dying in the Senate.

Here’s what PolitiFact National has to say about this version:

In this first version, for workers 55 and younger, Medicare would have changed from a program that pays doctors and hospitals for their services to one in which the government would designate a pot of money for each beneficiary to pay for private insurance premiums.

Beneficiaries would have selected a plan from a group that complies with standards set by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, which runs the health benefits program for federal employees.

The beneficiary would receive an amount based in part on the cost of the second-least-expensive plan available on the exchange.

The most recent version of Ryan’s plan has one key difference. He gave beneficiaries the option of selecting a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.

Does this mean Ryan’s plan is not a voucher system? Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber offered two main arguments to back up his statement:

One: The government pays, not the senior

""Premium support means the senior picks from a list of government-approved plans and then the government pays the bill,"" Talaber said.

This argument falls short. Early proponents of premium support did not consider this to be a defining characteristic of the system.

Even if they did, this type of approach would still fit the dictionary definition of ""voucher,"" which we described above.

Two: The amount of support would change to meet the rising cost of health care

Talaber pointed us to a 2011 blog post written by Aaron, co-author of the study we mentioned above.

""The defining attribute of the plans that Reischauer and I christened ‘premium support’ was that the amount of support was to be indexed to average healthcare costs, not, as in voucher plans, to a price index or per person income,"" Aaron wrote.

The difference is crucial, Aaron wrote: ""Voucher plans are virtually guaranteed to become increasingly inadequate; premium support plans will not.""

Aaron’s blog post, however, does not prove Gingrey’s point. As we mentioned above, Ryan’s plan indexes premium supports to the second-least-expensive plan available in the exchange -- not average health care costs.

This difference opens Ryan’s plan to reasonable criticism that it may not share premium support’s defining characteristic.

In the interest of fairness, we considered other arguments on why Ryan’s plan counts as premium support, not vouchers. Some backers of free-market reforms do think there’s a substantive difference, although experts interviewed by PolitiFact National differ on how to classify Ryan’s plan.

Aaron himself told PolitiFact National that he thinks ""premium support is a type of voucher.""

Further complicating the matter is that even among policy wonks, language tends to evolve over nearly two decades.
   
Regardless, Ryan’s plan fits the dictionary definition of ""voucher"" pretty well.

Gingrey’s statement that ""premium support is not vouchers,"" has two main problems.

It’s fair to argue that Ryan’s plan lacks an essential feature of ""premium support"" -- being indexed to average health care costs. We think this is a crucial shortcoming.

Furthermore, the claim draws distinctions that are too fine for a general audience -- and even some experts.

We give Gingrey a Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096700DC0>],/factchecks/2012/sep/17/phil-gingrey/gingrey-medicare-reform-plan-does-not-create-vouch/

Tennessee congressman defends vote raising Social Security age to 70 by saying it won’t happen until “turn of the century”
","
A central theme of Democratic challenger Eric Stewart’s campaign against 4th Congressional District incumbent Scott DesJarlais is the freshman’s support of House Republican budget plans and their impacts on Medicare and Social Security.

DesJarlais has sought to downplay attacks against his votes for raising the age of eligibility for Social Security benefits by arguing that no change will affect anyone currently 55 or older.

DesJarlais, a physician from South Pittsburg, Tenn., raised the issue on his own when he appeared on Nashville NewsChannel5’s weekly public affairs program ""Inside Politics"" on Aug. 17. He said: ""I want to talk about the fact that the Paul Ryan plan helps save Medicare when the Democrat plan lets Medicare end. There’s a lot of misnomers out there. He wants to charge that we’re raising Social Security age to 70. Under the current structure, that happens sometime at the beginning of the next century.""

In an interview  with The Daily News Journal of Murfreesboro, DesJarlais said that ""as far as this charge that I voted to raise the retirement age to 70, there’s a process where the retirement is pushed back by one month every two years, so by the time the retirement age hits 70, it’ll be sometime around the turn of the century.""

We can understand why a candidate treads carefully on Social Security. But there is no disputing this: On March 29, 2012, as the House was considering a series of Republican-sponsored budget reduction plans, DesJarlais voted for two separate GOP plans that would have major impacts on Social Security -- one which would have raised the eligibility age to 70 by 2048, or 52 years before the ""turn of the century."" Neither of the bills became law: The one that raised the retirement age to 70 in 2048 failed to pass the House and the other won House approval but never passed in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

The first was a budget-reduction plan submitted by the Republican Study Committee, which calls itself ""a group of House Republicans organized for the purpose of advancing a conservative social and economic agenda."" All of Tennessee’s Republican House members except Rep. John Duncan Jr. of Knoxville are RSC members and all of them except Duncan voted for the RSC plan.

The RSC’s website describes its budget plan in full, including its proposal for ""slowly increasing (Social Security’s) retirement age to 70 years…. For those born in 1978, the full-retirement age would remain at 70 years old.""

By our calculator, 1978 plus 70 is 2048 – more than five decades before the turn of the next century.

The Bipartisan Policy Center’s analysis says: ""Starting in 2023, the RSC budget proposes to increase the Social Security full retirement age by two months every year until it reaches age 70 in the year 2047.

The RSC plan’s failure cleared the way later that day for House approval of a separate plan by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, now the GOP vice presidential candidate. The Ryan plan did not list specific changes for Social Security but required Social Security trustees to submit a stabilization plan to the President and for the President to submit a plan to Congress. DesJarlais also voted for that plan.

In defending the accuracy of his statements, DesJarlais and his staff in essence contend that the Democrats have been attacking him for voting for the Ryan bill – which on March 29 did not contain a detailed provision for raising Social Security’s retirement age – and that that was what he was responding to with his ""turn of the century"" claim. His office pointed to an earlier, 2010 version of Ryan’s plan called ""Road Map to America’s Future"" that did include a detailed provision saying the Social Security. That plan says that ""retirement age will gradually increase until it reaches 70 in the next century."" An important note on that, however -- DesJarlais was not in Congress in 2010. He did not vote on that plan.

DesJarlais’ statement on the matter says: ""My statement regarding the time frame for raising social security is completely accurate when talking about Ryan’s budgetary roadmap, which has been the only budget that has been discussed and what I believed was being referred to.""

A review of Stewart’s website, including a web video, and media releases shows he has been talking about both the RSC plan and  the Ryan budget plan. But a press release issued by Stewart’s campaign that says DesJarlais’ ""turn of the century"" claim ""may be the falsity of the century"" specifically refers to his vote for the RSC plan.

Our ruling

To defend himself against charges that he voted to raise the Social Security age to 70, the freshman congressman points to his support for Congressman Paul Ryan’s 2010 budgetary road map where the retirement age doesn’t hit 70 until the next century.

But DesJarlais was not even in Congress in 2010, and the only vote he ever made on a plan that included a target date for raising the age to 70 came earlier this year.That plan called for raising Social Security age to 70 by 2047 or 2048 -- 52 years before the century turns.

For that bit of misdirection, we give the congressman a ruling of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096734C00>],/factchecks/2012/sep/17/scott-desjarlais/tennessee-congressman-defends-vote-raising-social-/
"['Rhode Island', 'Candidate Biography', 'Bernard Jackvony']","
Republican Bernard Jackvony says Democrat David Cicilline is the fifth most liberal Representative in Congress
","
One of the reasons U.S. Rep. David Cicilline gives when asking voters in the 1st Congressional District to send him back to Washington is that Rhode Islanders need a Democrat in that seat to prevent the Republican Party -- and by implication, conservatives -- from doing bad things.

During a discussion on the contest during the Rhode Island PBS program ""A Lively Experiment,"" former Republican Lt. Gov. Bernard Jackvony said Cicilline is far more liberal than most.

How liberal?

""Cicilline is the 5th most liberal person in the House of Representatives,"" he said.

There's no reason to debate Cicilline's liberalism, but is he really the 5th-most left-leaner in that highly partisan institution?

When we called Jackvony to ask the source of his information, he said he heard the factoid as part of a question in the WPRI-TV-Providence Journal debate on Aug. 28 between Cicilline and Anthony Gemma. WPRI's Ted Nesi told us he made a reference to Cicilline's voting record, but he was referring to a different ranking, by OpenCongress.org.

On that website, Cicilline is indeed ranked 5th. But it's a list of party-line votes among Democrats, not liberal votes. Of 1,697 votes logged, the congressman voted with the majority of the House Democratic caucus 95.9 percent of the time.

One could argue that Democrat votes are liberal votes, but that's a gross oversimplification. The website notes that the list makes no distinction between serious deeply divisive issues and the hundreds of votes on routine matters where ideology doesn't play a role.

The Washington Post has a similar database. It has Cicilline voting with the party on 96 percent of 1,503 votes. In that ranking, where the percentages are rounded off, Cicilline is listed as third among Democrats. But 36 House members -- 11 Democrats and 25 Republicans -- also voted with the party line at least 96 percent of the time.

Because Jackvony characterized Cicilline as the 5th-most liberal member of the House, we looked for other sources that actually use that metric.

Many special-interest groups give legislators scores for their votes on various liberal and conservative issues, although their lists are typically not very comprehensive.

However, the National Journal, a weekly magazine that covers politics, has an annual survey that ranks members of Congress on the liberal and conservative scales. In its latest report, Cicilline is the 48th most liberal member of the House, based on 949 roll call votes. That keeps him out of the National Journal's ""Most Liberal"" category.

We also checked rankings for two conservative organizations, where the more liberal you are, the lower your score.

Heritage Action for America, the activist arm of The Heritage Foundation, scores Cicilline at 12 percent, tied for 31st place (with 24 others) on the liberal scale.

Club for Growth has Cicilline tied at 19th from the bottom.

The liberal website Progressive Punch tags Cicilline as the 49th most liberal member of the House.

In short, nobody puts him close to 5th.

And to illustrate how the rankings differ depending on who does them, the National Review and Progressive Punch list Cicilline as more liberal than his Rhode Island colleague, Rep. James Langevin. Heritage Action and Club for Growth say Langevin is more liberal.

Our ruling

Former Lt. Gov. Bernard Jackvony said Rep. David Cicilline ""is the 5th most liberal person in the House of Representatives.""

He was citing a statistic that ranked party-line voting, not liberal votes, although among Democrats the two often go hand in hand.

There is no definitive arbiter of which congressman is more liberal than the next. Different organizations judge candidate voting records differently.

The rankings we found gave Cicilline a bit more moderate score and the respected National Journal didn't even include the congressman in its tally of the 25 ""most liberal"" members of the House.

Cicilline is clearly liberal. But because Jackvony was so specific, and he was specifically wrong, we rate his statement False.

Democratic group says Duffy voted against pay increases for troops but in favor of protecting his own salary
","
The TV ad  that mocks Republican congressman Sean Duffy as a selfish pol who opposed pay for U.S. troops is one of the toughest we’ve seen in the fall 2012 campaign.

As combat soldiers trudge under a hot sun, a narrator begins: ""They fought for us, walked a mile in these boots.""

The camera pans to shiny black wing-tips: ""Congressman Duffy walked in these, ahem, shoes.""

The ad from the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee continues: ""Facing a government shutdown, Duffy voted against making sure our soldiers got paid...against increasing combat pay."" Onscreen: Duffy voted against paying our soldiers.

The narrator contemptuously adds: ""But Duffy made sure he got paid."" Onscreen: Duffy voted to protect his own pay.

Pretty serious stuff -- and Democrats are raising the same votes against other Republican candidates.

So, did Duffy -- who faces Democrat Pat Kreitlow in his bid for a second term -- really vote to stop military pay raises while shielding his own pocketbook?

Turns out the votes cited -- in those footnotes at the bottom of the screen -- are not the whole story.

Not even close.

The votes referenced in the ad all come from spring 2011, when an extended partisan tussle over spending cuts brought the federal government close to a shutdown. One of the sticky issues was how to deal with congressional pay and military pay if a shutdown occurred. There was plenty of maneuvering for partisan advantage and both parties claimed they were on the side of the troops.

To back up its claim, the DCCC pointed us to votes on Democratic-sponsored amendments to three bills. Here’s what we found on the votes in congressional roll calls, the official legislative history and media reports.

-- ""Voted against paying our soldiers.""

April 7, 2011: As President Barack Obama and Republican leaders negotiated one day before a shutdown deadline, the GOP-controlled House passed a one-week appropriations bill (H.R. 1363). It funded the Department of Defense for a longer period, the remainder of the fiscal year, through Sept. 30, 2011.

Obama had warned that a shutdown would threaten troop pay. Republicans, trying to keep the pressure on, called their measure a ""troop funding bill."" But Democrats complained it cut too deep and included an unacceptable ban on public funds for abortions in Washington, D.C.

Less than 10 minutes before the final approval of the bill, Democrats forced a vote on a different motion.

That motion sought to ensure that members of the military would continue to get paid in the event of a shutdown. The maker of the motion, U.S. Rep. Bill Owens, D-New York, argued Obama planned to veto the Republican appropriations for the military, so the troops still would not get paid.

Owens did not explain how he expected to protect troop pay through an amendment to a bill the president had pledged to veto.

U.S. Rep. Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, sponsor of the spending bill, said on the floor: ""This motion is purely a political gesture and should be defeated ... The real fact is that if you vote against this bill, you are voting against the troops who are engaged in three wars.""

Duffy voted no on the motion along with all but one other Republican.

But he was in the 247-181 majority, including 15 Democrats, that approved the underlying bill.

So, did Duffy ""vote against paying our soldiers"" as the ad says?

No. He opposed one amendment, but the effect of his votes would have kept money flowing to the military for the rest of the budget year.

-- Voted ""against increasing combat pay.""

May 26, 2011: After the 2011 funding crisis was averted, the House debated a defense authorization bill for the following year, 2012.

Democrats called for a vote on a motion to boost pay for combat troops.

U.S. Rep. Buck McKeon, R-California, called it transparently political:
""We had all kinds of time to bring an amendment that would be helpful like this, then they bring this one. There's no offset. This would just put us again above the allocation from the chairman. This is really more Democrat increasing spending.""

The motion failed, with Duffy in opposition.

What the DCCC ad doesn’t say is that the full bill -- supported by Duffy, nearly all Republicans and 95 Democrats -- already included a pay hike of 1.6 percent in the monthly basic pay for members of the uniformed services. That covered combat troops as well.

So, Duffy didn’t vote for the additional bump proposed at the very end of the process, but he voted for the increased pay level in the underlying bill. He did the same in 2012, on a 1.7 percent pay increase.

Think of it this way: There is a bill to increase spending by $500,000 for a particular program. An amendment is offered to increase it to $750,000. If a person votes against the amendment but for the bill, are they ""voting against an increase in spending"" for the program?

-- ""Voted to protect his own pay.""

April 1, 2011: During the shutdown crisis, Republicans controlling the House approved a bill (H.R. 1255) directing that its version of budget cuts become law if the Senate did not act by April 6, 2011.

Both parties maneuvered to score points during debate on the bill, resulting in separate actions that were largely symbolic and arguably unconstitutional.

While the GOP claimed the House action alone could make the bill law, Roll Call pointed out the bill ""would not become law unless the Senate also approves it and the president signs it into law, neither of which is expected to occur.""

The budget-cuts bill included a prohibition on paying members of Congress and the president during a shutdown (members get paid during a shutdown while most federal employees do not). But as even some Republicans pointed out, under the constitution pay cannot be reduced mid-term. To address that concern, some proponents argued members would get paid retroactively for any loss of salary.

Democrats pounced on that -- and went further, seeking an amendment to bar any retro payments. But  The Washington Post reported that they got a surprise on the floor when when a Republican member revealed an email from Obama’s Justice Department questioning the constitutionality of the motion.

Duffy and all but one Republican voted against the Democratic motion, which failed. Duffy voted in favor of H.R. 1255, including the ban on paying members during a shutdown. It passed but died in the Senate.

Both measures -- as dubious legally as they were -- were attempts to erase the pay protections that members of Congress have in current law for getting paid during a shutdown.

Indeed, it is standard for all federal employees to get retroactive pay once a shutdown ends is standard, PolitiFact National found in a 2011 Truth-O-Meter item.

So saying that Duffy was out to protect his check is a big stretch.

A final note:

The Democratic amendments in question were ""motions to recommit,"" a prerogative of the minority party since the first Congress. They are motions, partly procedural, that attempt to send a bill back to committee just before passage.

""Both parties, when in the minority, have used these to make political statements and embarrass the majority for partisan advantage,"" said Donald Wolfensberger, an expert on parliamentary rules who was a key Republican staffer for the House Rules Committee in the 1990s. ""It is well understood in modern times that these are designed for partisan campaign purposes and usually have little to do with better policy.""

Indeed, Democrats complained bitterly in 2007 when then-minority Republicans used ""MTRs"" to stall and score political points, the Post noted.

For example, in March 2007, Democrats tried to pass a bill to give the District of Columbia a vote in the House. From the Post: ""Republicans moved to recommit the bill to committee, attaching new language that would have thrown out the District’s strict anti-gun laws. Worried that conservative, pro-gun Democrats would feel compelled to vote with GOP and kill the bill, Democratic leaders yanked it from the floor.""

Both parties, when in the minority, contend the motions can have merit and are not purely procedural.

Our rating

A Democratic TV ad charges that Duffy ""voted against paying our soldiers"" and ""against increasing combat pay"" while voting ""to protect his own pay.""

The claims are based on Duffy’s votes on ""motions to recommit"" that preceded final votes on military and congressional pay. Such motions are routinely denied by the majority party as procedural moves. That gives the minority party the chance to structure them for partisan advantage.

That’s what is playing out in the ad now.

We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C4B3340>],/factchecks/2012/sep/16/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-group-says-duffy-voted-against-pay-incr/

There were 22 other co-sponsors
","A new TV ad airing in Iowa and New Hampshire says that Hillary Clinton ""stood by our National Guard and Reserve and kept standing till they received health care they deserved.""
 
The record indicates that Clinton has been an advocate for expanded health benefits for National Guard and Reserve members.
 
In 2005, she was one of 23 co-sponsors for legislation sponsored by Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina that would allow reserve troops to enroll in Tricare, a Defense Department managed health care program. (Statements on Clinton's Web site don't mention that she was one of many co-sponsors.)
 
The legislation didn't pass, but much of its substance was adopted in the 2007 defense authorization bill.
 
The tone of her ad suggests she was a key player in the passage of the bill, but the record indicates that Graham took the lead in the effort, and she was one of several supporters. So while it's fair for her to say she was an advocate for expanded benefits for Guard and Reserve members, the statement would be more accurate if it indicated she was one of many.

Not the funding gap he claims
","Former Sen. John Edwards says he cares passionately about rural schools. He is, in fact, a product of them. Felt like a ""hick"" as the first member of his poor family to go to college.
 
And Edwards wants to do more for rural schools, to give more children like him the chance to have experiences like his.
 
But this statement, made during his education platform speech, falls flat on fact. One need only to look at the very sources his campaign cites as his supporting documents — the National Education Association and the National Center for Education Statistics — to see that the former vice presidential candidate and his team read the headlines, but not the details.
 
The NEA actually says on its Web site that rural — and small — schools account for 40 percent of the nation's public school students. In an e-mail, a spokesman for the NEA said rural schools alone enroll about 20 percent of the nation's students.
 
That fits with the National Center for Education Statistics breakdown of figures in a June 2007 report.
That report shows that rural schools account for 31 percent of the nation's schools and enroll 21.3 percent of the nation's students.
 
Those schools get 18 percent of all federal funding, not 22 percent, the NCES report further shows. That's actually lower than what Edwards said, but since the enrollment is half of what Edwards claimed, the big disparity he was seeking to illustrate just isn't there. Using sources provided by his own campaign, we rate this Edwards statement to be ""False.""

She's been active on issues for 9/11 workers

In a Clinton campaign ad airing in Iowa and New Hampshire, an announcer says the New York senator has been a strong advocate for workers who responded to the 9/11 attacks. ""She stood by ground zero workers who sacrificed their health after so many sacrificed their lives and kept standing till this administration took action,"" the announcer says.
 
As you might expect for a senator from the state where the deadliest attack occurred, the record indicates she has been a consistent advocate for workers who responded to the World Trade Center and cleaned up the debris after the two buildings were destroyed.
 
Soon after the attacks, Clinton and fellow New York Sen. Charles Schumer pushed legislation to aid New York City's recovery. She also has been a proponent of government programs to track the health of workers who were exposed to smoke and dust at the site. The doctors who monitored the workers' health credited Clinton with steering $12-million to a Centers for Disease Control program for that work.
 
Clinton has testified at hearings on the health status of 9/11 workers, and she has publicly criticized the Environmental Protection Agency for its early statement that the air at the World Trade Center site was safe.
 
There is considerable evidence that she has been active on issues to help and protect the workers, so we find her claim to be True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Fred Thompson']","
The Iraq Study Group didn't say that
","During a Republican debate in Dearborn, Mich., on Oct. 9, 2007, Fred Thompson was asked to explain his previous comments about whether Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction. He replied that Saddam had used them against the Kurds and had nuclear reactors in the early 1980s. Thompson added, ""The Iraq Study Group reported that (Saddam) had designs on reviving his nuclear program, which he had started once upon a time.""
 
The Iraq Study Group was a bipartisan panel created by Congress to recommend a better U.S. strategy in Iraq. The panel was headed by former Secretary of State James A. Baker III and Lee Hamilton, a former member of Congress who chaired the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
 
In December 2006, the group released its report,

The Way Forward: A New Approach,

which recommended a new U.S. strategy. The 142-page report focused on the future of Iraq and did not address whether Saddam wanted to restart a nuclear program. So we find Thompson's claim to be False.
 
It's possible that Thompson was referring to the Iraq Survey Group, a CIA panel that was formed to investigate whether there were weapons of mass destruction or the intent to produce WMDs in Saddam Hussein's Iraq. The report found that Saddam did not produce or possess any weapons of mass destruction for more than a decade before the U.S.-led invasion, but that he ""aspired to develop a nuclear capability — in an incremental fashion, irrespective of international pressure and the resulting economic risks.""

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
Not by himself, he didn't
","Rudy Giuliani has repeatedly said that he cut taxes 23 times while he was mayor of New York. He repeated the claim during a debate in Dearborn, Mich., on Oct. 9, 2007.
 
The problem is, he was opposed to one of the tax cuts he lists, and several other cuts were championed by others or involved state funds — not city funds.
 
The most glaring example is the expiration of the 12.5 percent personal income tax surcharge on New York City residents. Peter Vallone, then the city council speaker and a candidate for governor, championed letting the tax expire, while Giuliani opposed him. After about five months, the mayor and the city council came to a budget agreement, and Giuliani changed his mind and let the tax expire.
 
Some New Yorkers have disputed whether the mayor may appropriately take credit for the STAR program, a property tax rebate that Gov. George Pataki initiated and paid for with state funds, according to an analysis of the cuts by the

New York Daily News.

 
The Annenberg Political FactCheck, a fact-checking Web site, looked at the ""23 tax cuts"" line when the campaign used the figure in a Giuliani radio ad. FactCheck concluded, based on information from New York City's Independent Budget Office, that eight of the tax cuts Giuliani boasts about actually should be credited to state government initiatives. In addition, FactCheck said he did not deserve credit for the personal income tax surcharge and that overall, he could rightly claim only 14 of the 23 tax cuts.
 
The Giuliani campaign has argued that Giuliani deserves credit for any tax cuts under his watch. Giuliani made the case himself to a reporter in an exchange that was captured on video.
 
In the video, Giuliani said he deserves credit for the tax cuts because he publicly argued for them and lobbied for them, and that he was the chief executive of the tax base that was affected.
 
Still, we find it's a stretch for Giuliani to personally take credit for 23 when many of them were primarily pushed by others. So we find his claim to be Half True.

Going, going ... probably wrong.
","John McCain might be right, but we don't think so.
 
McCain's campaign didn't return repeated calls and e-mails to confirm where the 50,000 number came from.
 
But it clearly didn't come from eBay.
 
""We're not exactly sure where he got the number. We don't even calculate according to the U.S.,"" said eBay spokeswoman Deanna Monestero. ""I don't want to say it's wrong, but I can't trace it.""
 
The latest figures for the U.S. date back to 2005, when an A.C. Nielsen study revealed 724,000 Americans used eBay to make some money. But the survey didn't break down the number to figure out how many were just making a few bucks compared with the number making a living on eBay.
 
Back in 2003, a similar survey found that 430,000 Americans made all or some of their income from the internet auction site. But once again, the survey didn't break down the ""all"" and ""some"" income numbers.
 
That same year, Jim Griffith, who is eBay's so-called ""dean of education"" (who knew there was one?), was quoted in a Colorado newspaper as saying, ""More than 20,000 people earn their living selling on eBay in the United States.""
 
But a company spokeswoman couldn't say where that number came from, either.
 
These days, the company only keeps track of eBay entrepreneurs worldwide. That number, based on a 2006 Nielsen study, is estimated at 1.3-million. But again, it doesn't distinguish between full-time and part-time on-line auctioneers.
 
The bottom line: Lots of people make money on eBay, but how many depend on it to pay their bills remains unclear.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Standing up, but not alone
","In a TV ad airing in Iowa and New Hampshire, Sen. Hillary Clinton portrays herself as a leader on health care. ""Hillary stood up for universal health care when almost no one else would,"" the announcer says, ""and kept standing till 6-million kids had coverage.""
 
Indeed, the New York senator has a record as an advocate for health care reform. When she was first lady, President Bill Clinton appointed her to head the President's Task Force on National Health Reform. But the group formulated a plan that ended up going down in defeat. It was one of the most significant defeats of President Clinton's first term.
 
Critics of the Clinton health plan, mostly Republicans, focused on her role and mocked the proposal as Hillary Care. The name has stuck and made a resurgence in the past few weeks since now-candidate Clinton has proposed her own plan.
 
But did she stand up for universal health care ""when almost no one else did""? That's a stretch.
 
The president obviously also favored it in 1992, but so did every other major Democratic candidate — Jerry Brown, Tom Harkin, Bob Kerrey and Paul Tsongas. It also had support in Congress, though not enough to pass. So we find the ""almost no one else"" claim to be an exaggeration.
 
For the second part of the assertion, the Clinton campaign said the ""6-million kids"" refers to those who would benefit from the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), which passed in 1997 and was funded with cigarette taxes. SCHIP provides federal funding to states, which then put up their own money and set rules to provide health care for uninsured children.
 
Much of the credit for SCHIP usually goes to Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. But the Clinton campaign says she used her influence behind the scenes to push for SCHIP, and there is evidence to support that.
 
Shortly after the legislation passed, the

New York Times

reported, ""Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support.""
 
We don't dispute that Clinton worked behind the scenes for SCHIP, but the TV ad gives her disproportionate credit for the entire program. We find that the ad overstates her role on this count and also on the broader issue of universal health care. And so we find the claim to be Half True.

He nails two stats, misses a third
","Edwards, aiming to win rural voters' support in early-voting states including Iowa and South Carolina, is trying to make the case that the government ought to pay more attention to their education needs. So he talks about how troubled the rural schools are.
 
But he sometimes overstates the case.
 
In this single sentence, Edwards makes three distinct claims about the state of affairs in rural education. On accuracy, he goes two for three.
 
First, consider dropout rates. Yes, rural schools have a high rate, 11 percent, as the June 2007 report by the National Center for Education Statistics shows. Just not the highest.
 
The dropout rate in urban areas is worse: 13 percent.
 
But Edwards is right when he says that rural schools have the lowest college enrollment rates in the country. Only 27 percent of students coming from rural schools enrolled in college in 2004-05, according to the report, well below the 37 percent rate in cities and suburbs, and lower than the 32 percent in towns.
 
And he also has it right on teacher pay. The federal report is pretty clear: ""Public school teachers in rural areas earned, on average, lower salaries in 2003-04 than their peers in towns, suburbs and cities.""
Taking it all into consideration, we rate Edwards' statements on rural education as ""Half True.""

"['National', 'Education', 'Hillary Clinton']","
No records, but there are witnesses
","In responding to a question about testing from education, Sen. Hillary Clinton said she ""led the effort"" to improve Arkansas schools in 1983.
 
It might seem an easy fact to prove. But 24-year-old records from Arkansas don't pop up on the Internet, and folks from the state's Department of Education apologized that someone apparently had thrown out the supporting documents.
 
So we turned to press clippings from the time, and to the folks who were there.
 
They unequivocally state that Clinton, who was Arkansas First Lady at the time, did chair the state's 1983 Education Standards Committee at a time when Arkansas was trying to move up from the bottom of the nation's many school-related rankings, from student performance to teacher pay.
After meetings in all 75 counties, the committee made several recommendations. These included raising the dropout age, requiring all high schools to offer advanced math and science courses, and mandating smaller class sizes. To pay for the changes, it also proposed a sales tax increase.
 
And to win support for these ideas, Clinton and her husband, then Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton, called for competency tests for all teachers — something the teachers hated but the public loved.
 
""Over and over again I was asked, 'What are you going to do about all the incompetent teachers?'"" Mrs. Clinton told the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette in 1984.
 
The initiatives won resounding approval in a special session of the Legislature in late 1983.
 
But was Mrs. Clinton a chairwoman in name only? Or was she truly the change agent?
 
""She shepherded it through and was absolutely instrumental in getting it approved through the legislative process and accepted in general by the public,"" said Peggy Nabors, president of the state teachers union at the time, who now is leaning toward supporting Clinton for president.
 
The state has made many education reforms since, and its national ranking has risen to the middle of the pack. Arkansas School Boards Association executive director Dan Farley, a Clinton backer, said the 1983 initiative lit the flame for such changes in a state that didn't have education on its front burner before.
 
""We still have a way to go,"" he said. ""But the earliest flickering started then.""

He's right that others have hedged
","
In an interview on MSNBC, Romney tried to turn the tables on his Republican rivals -- who have accused him of flip-flopping on various issues -- by saying he was more consistent on gay marriage than they have been.
 
He said, ""I don't think that Rudy (Giuliani) or Fred (Thompson) or John McCain support the marriage amendment. And I think they're in error on that one.""
 
Indeed, Romney is the only Republican front-runner unequivocally backing a constitutional gay marriage ban.
 
Giuliani, Thompson and McCain share his opposition to same-sex marriage but they vary in how they would address the issue at the federal level. Romney is the only Republican front-runner to support an amendment to the Constitution, such as the one that failed in Congress last year, which would limit marriage to male-female unions.
 
McCain, who actively opposed the 2006 amendment attempt on the grounds that it was unnecessary and would violate states' rights, says that he would only support such an amendment if the Supreme Court began to strike down state-level gay marriage bans.
 
Thompson has proposed a constitutional amendment that would not ban gay marriages, but would free states from the obligation to recognize same-sex marriages performed in other states. That provision was included in the 1996 Defense of Marriage Act, which Thompson and McCain both supported, but it is still being challenged in the courts. A constitutional amendment would preempt any judicial challenge to the existing law.
 
A spokesman for Giuliani said the former mayor ""does not support a federal marriage amendment at this time."" Giuliani told CNN's Larry King in February 2007 that he would not support a constitutional amendment, ""unless all of a sudden lots of states do what Massachusetts does and kind of come at it from the other side and decide that the Constitution says that -- that you cannot have marriage between a man and a woman. If it stays the way it is, you don't need one.""
 
We find Romney's statement on his opponents to be True because he is accurately describing their positions.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Mike Huckabee']","
Apples and oranges
","Mike Huckabee illustrates a need for overhauling our health care system by comparing what is spent in the U.S. on health care versus what is spent on what he calls the entire military budget.
 
There are two problems with Huckabee's statement.
 
Here's the first one: The number Huckabee quotes for U.S. military expenses is only what the U.S. Department of Defense spends, which at about $520 billion in 2007 is 3.8 percent of the nation's gross domestic product.
 
But defense spending is spread across many other budgets. According to the White House's Office of Management and Budget, the nation's entire 2007 national defense budget — which includes atomic energy and defense-related activities in the departments of Homeland Security, Justice, State and Commerce — is $570 billion. That's about 4.2 percent of GDP. So, Huckabee's off, but not by much.
 
Here's the bigger problem. In his statement, Huckabee seems to be comparing federal government spending on the military to total spending in the U.S. on health care. Not just government money, but also private spending.
 
His campaign didn't return phone calls to explain what he meant or from where he drew his statistics. But his 17 percent of GDP most closely resembles a figure cited by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the federal agency responsible for administering health programs. It reported in January 2007 that the U.S. is projected to spend about 16.2 percent of GDP on national health expenditures this year, or about $2.3-trillion.
 
But that's everything. What the federal government spends, what state and local governments spend, what private citizens spend.
 
The same study shows that if you subtract private sector money from the equation, health care expenses by the federal government drop to 5.5 percent of GDP. Add in state and local government spending and you get to 7.6 percent of GDP.
 
Of course, ""we,"" all of us, make up the private sector. So Huckabee has every right to include the private with public expenses when citing the true cost of U.S. health care in proportion to GDP.
But comparing that with government-only spending on the military, or anything else, artificially inflates the disparity between the two costs.

"['National', 'Families', 'LGBTQ', 'Mitt Romney']","
Consistent on gay marriage, not on amendment
","
In a Sept. 14, 2007 interview on MSNBC, Romney said, ""I have not changed my position on the marriage amendment or anything else related to marriage that ...you know, I think the New York Times said that I had changed my tone.""
 
Here's a look at his comments over the years:
 
In 1994, as a candidate for the U.S. Senate, he told a Boston-area gay newspaper that the definition of marriage was a ""state issue as you know -- the authorization of marriage on a same-sex basis falls under state jurisdiction.""
 
During his Senate race, Romney wrote in a letter to the Massachusetts branch of the Log Cabin Republicans, ""I am more convinced than ever before that as we seek to establish full equality for America's gay and lesbian citizens, I will provide more effective leadership than my opponent."" He promised the group that he would support laws preventing discrimination against gays and lesbians in the workplace and implied his hope for the eventual full integration of gays in the military.
 
But even in 1994, he clearly opposed legalizing same-sex marriage, telling the Bay Windows newspaper that he backed the current governor's position that the law should only uphold male-female marriages.
 
In 2002, when Romney was governor, his wife, son and daughter-in-law signed a petition supporting a proposed amendment to the Massachusetts constitution, that would not only ban the state from recognizing same-sex marriages, but further stated, ""Any other relationship shall not be recognized as a marriage or its legal equivalent, nor shall it receive the benefits or incidents exclusive to marriage.""
 
But Romney quickly expressed his opposition to the amendment, saying that although he believed marriage was between a man and a woman, the language barring civil unions was ""too extreme,"" with his spokesman telling the Boston Globe, ""Mitt does not support it. As far as Mitt is concerned, it goes farther than current law, and therefore it's unnecessary.""
 
Yet in 2003, when the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled that same-sex couples could be married in the state, Romney urged the legislature to adopt a constitutional amendment banning the practice. He has since supported a similar amendment to the U.S. Constitution, despite the fact that the congressionally proposed constitutional amendment includes language similar to the 2002 Massachusetts ballot proposal that he opposed.
 
And so we give Romney a Half-True. He is correct that he has been consistent in his opposition to same-sex marriage, but has changed his position as to the scope of an amendment that he would support.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'John Edwards']","
Edwards forgets Kucinich
","At a debate, John Edwards talked about his support for universal health care, capping it off by saying he was the first candidate to lay out a specific plan.
 
That's true only if you don't count Dennis Kucinich. Yes, Kucinich is a long-shot candidate, but he's been promoting a fairly specific, universal health care plan since at least 2005 and arguably earlier.
 
The Edwards' campaign responded to a question on this point by saying Edwards meant for the 2008 cycle. We suspect he likely was more focused on his closest rivals, Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. And he did beat those two to the health care punch by several months, introducing his plan in February 2007, while Obama introduced his in May and Clinton in September.
 
Edwards' plan requires employers to cover employees or pay into a government fund so employees can buy their own insurance. It also creates regional health care markets so those people don't have to negotiate on their own with insurers. After that, the plan has an individual mandate requiring every person to be insured. Edwards pays for the plan through a combination of cost savings and tax increases on higher income levels.
 
The Kucinich plan, on the other hand, is reflected in a piece of legislation he co-sponsored in the U.S. House. It was introduced in the House in 2005, though Kucinich supported an earlier version during his previous run for president in 2004. It would provide free health care for all, including primary care, prescription drugs, and mental health services. The plan would be paid for by cost savings and tax increases on the top 5 percent of income earners, an increased payroll tax, and taxes on stock and bond transactions.
 
The legislation has little chance of passing, but it's still fairly specific and it's certainly universal. Edwards may have had caveats in mind when he made his comment, but ""first"" means ""first,"" and Edwards wasn't.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Democratic National Committee']","
Or maybe Iraq isn't that simple
","Sen. John McCain's television ad in which he touts his history of criticizing the Bush administration on Iraq has drawn the fire of the Democratic National Committee. In a news release on Oct. 3, 2007, the DNC declared, ""McCain Trying to Have it Both Ways on Iraq.""
 
Here's the DNC's full charge: ""After years of supporting President Bush's failed strategy in Iraq, and after leading the charge for the Bush-McCain escalation of that war, John McCain is trying to have it both ways by trying to cast himself as a longtime critic of the administration while at the same time refusing to change course on the war.""
 
Well, yes, that's true. McCain is indeed trying to cast himself as a longtime critic of the administration while staying the course in Iraq. More to the point, though, it's accurate. McCain actually has been a longtime critic of the administration on Iraq, even as he has advocated a sustained and larger military presence there.
 
But saying that's ""having it both ways"" is just the kind of oversimplifying of facts the Democrats love to accuse the White House of doing. A bit like saying that opposing U.S. involvement Iraq is the same as opposing the war on terrorism.
 
McCain's ad is part of an attempt to distinguish himself from the president on Iraq. The Democrats point out that McCain has been wedded to the president's overall war policy, and like President Bush, McCain has displayed a tendency to offer rosy predictions about the outcome in Iraq, even as conditions didn't seem to be improving much.
 
All of that is true, and there's no shortage of evidence.
 
""I think the situation on the ground is going to improve,"" McCain told the

Hill

newspaper on Dec. 8, 2005. ""I do think that progress is being made in a lot of Iraq. Overall, I think a year from now, we will have made a fair amount of progress if we stay the course. If I thought we weren't making progress, I'd be despondent.""
 
As the top Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, McCain has been a tireless supporter of the war, and he has robustly defended the president's ability to wage the war as he saw fit. Arguing Sept. 19, 2007, against an amendment that would have required troops to spend as much time at home as they spent in Iraq before being sent back to Iraq, McCain said this on the Senate floor:
 
""Clearly the message I am getting from the troops in the field is not that the war is lost. ... We are succeeding and we are winning. And with the enactment of this amendment, we will choose to lose. This is setting a formula for surrender, not for victory.
 
""I am hearing from the troops in the field three words, three words: Let us win. They have sacrificed a great deal. ... Now give them a chance to win. That is what they want. They do not want that sacrifice to be in vain.""
 
McCain was calling for more troops and resources as far back as 2003, just months after the invasion. He criticized former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld for two years before Rumsfeld resigned. In speeches and interviews, he frequently warned that failure to change tactics would lead to a long and difficult fight.
 
In fact, it's common for McCain to express his concerns about the U.S. strategy in Iraq and his belief in the U.S. mission there in the same speech.
 
""We have made many, many mistakes since 2003 and these will not be easily reversed,"" McCain said during a Jan. 5, 2007, panel discussion at the conservative-leaning American Enterprise Institute. ""Even greater than the cost thus far, and in the future, however, are the catastrophic consequences that would ensue from our failure in Iraq.""
 
McCain's positions on Iraq underscore the complexity of the war as a political issue, and of McCain's unique position as supporter and critic. It may prove difficult for voters to get the nuance. It also may offer a little insight into why the other top-tier presidential candidates, Republicans and Democrats alike, are treading a bit more lightly.
 
The DNC's critique of McCain has at its core a nugget of truth about how McCain supports the war while being critical of how it has been conducted. But we find the DNC's claim that this is ""having it both ways"" to be a Barely True presentation of the facts.

"['National', 'Guns', 'Mike Huckabee']","
A correct account of past Giuliani positions
","The full quote from Mike Huckabee's interview:
 
""One thing I have to admire about Rudy, and he was I think courageous to go to the NRA, because his past positions -- he's sued gun manufacturers. He was supportive of Brady. He was supportive of things like assault weapon bans, which really is a misnomer, because it's really ridiculous to call a semiautomatic weapon an assault weapon.""
 
We find Huckabee's claims are accurate.
 
In 2000, during Giuliani's term as mayor, he announced that New York City was filing a lawsuit against two dozen gun manufacturers. The city alleged practices such as deliberately producing more guns than could be legally bought and ignoring illegal sales by gun distributors.
 
Giuliani has since distanced himself from the lawsuit, recently saying that it ""has taken several turns and several twists that [he does not] agree with,"" but this does not detract from Huckabee's assertion that Giuliani sued gun makers.
 
The Brady Bill, which created a waiting period for handgun purchases and background checks, became law in 1993. The Assault Weapons Ban, which prohibited the sale of some semi-automatic weapons, expired in 2004 after 10 years on the books. In a February, 2007 interview Giuliani was asked about them both and said: ""I was in favor of it because I thought that it was necessary both to get the crime bill passed and also necessary with the 2,000 murders or so that we were looking at,"" annually in New York City at the time.
 
Currently, Giuliani's stance on gun control is ""that we need to enforce laws that exist, as opposed to passing new laws that infringe on individual rights.""
 
Huckabee's claims, however, deal with Giuliani's past positions rather than his current ones, and as such are accurate.

"['National', 'Energy', 'Mike Gravel']","
Yes, in theory, but not in practice
","Gravel said at a debate that 5-million windmills could produce enough energy, electrical and otherwise, to serve the whole country.
 
In theory, he's right. The energy experts we interviewed did not dispute that 5-million 2.5-megawatt windmills, operating under normal conditions, would produce energy equal to and surpassing total U.S. energy consumption of about 9-billion megawatt hours per year.
 
So, it's true, but not at all realistic.
 
""Technically it could be that big, but it wouldn't be economically feasible,"" said Ryan Wiser, a staff scientist with the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
 
Wind is described as an intermittent energy source because the wind doesn't always blow. So power production from windmills varies. It's not cost-efficient or practical to store the quantities of wind power you would need to power the entire country consistently, Wiser said.
 
Researchers are debating the potential of supplying 20 percent of U.S. electrical consumption via wind turbines, the term for electricity-producing windmills. Hitting 20 percent is considered controversial and ambitious. Wiser said scientific studies are still in draft form, but they look promising.
 
Currently, the United States gets between 0.8 and 1 percent of its electricity from wind power.
 
President Bush has spoken approvingly of wind energy, because of its minimal impact on the environment. The

Wall Street Journal

reported in July 2007 that the U.S. wind industry, which has lagged behind its counterpart in Europe, is now ramping up. Demand is strong for the high-tech parts used to build wind turbines, so much so that shortages are preventing new projects from starting.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'John McCain']","
He told you so!
","John McCain is right: He told them so.
 
Although he has been one of the Senate's strongest and most vocal advocates of the war in Iraq, leading recent debates against Democratic bills to set a timetable for withdrawal, McCain has also been one of the Bush adminstration's biggest Republican critics.
 
As far back as mid 2003, shortly after the invasion of Iraq, McCain was warning that the United States needed to send more troops to Iraq and more money to Iraq reconstruction efforts, or else face a deep and long-lasting insurgency that would threaten America's mission there.
 
Which, of course, is exactly what has happened. He was also a strident critic of former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld, telling interviewers that he lacked confidence in Rumsfeld as far back as 2004 — meaty criticism for a top Republican on the Armed Services Committee.
 
""There's not enough (troops), and we are in a very serious situation, in my view, a race against time. We need to spend a whole lot more money to get the services back to the people. We need to get the electricity going, the fuel, the water. And unless we get that done and get it done pretty soon, we could face a very serious situation,"" McCain told NBC's

Meet the Press

on Aug. 24, 2003.
 
""Time is not on our side. People in 125-degree heat with no electricity and no fuel are going to become angry in a big hurry. The sophistication of the attacks on U.S. and allied troops have increased. And what we do in the next several months will determine whether we're in a very difficult situation or not, and there's still time, but we've got to act quickly.""
 
Despite McCain's contrary position on how the Bush administration has fought the war, however, pollsters say the public never really picked up on the nuance: He has always been seen as a Bush loyalist on the war, which is increasingly unpopular. And that's problematic for his presidential campaign.
 
About the only praise McCain has given the Bush administration on the war followed Bush's decision to send 30,000 more troops to Iraq over the past summer. That may have contributed to the sense that McCain was one of the president's men, experts said.
 
""Six months ago, Republican voters felt that he was in lockstep with the president (on the war) and … he was just going off the edge for the cliff for the president,"" said Dick Bennett, president of the New Hampshire-based American Research Group.
 
This new ad, which is running in New Hampshire and on his Web site, coupled with the message McCain is taking to campaign stops, is designed to put new emphasis on McCain's differences with an unpopular president over an unpopular war. With it, McCain hopes to turn a neat political trick: Supporting the overall policy, while reminding people that he would have done it differently.
 
As for his claim that just ""one man"" opposed the strategy in Iraq, that's a bit of a stretch: Independent experts and many congressional Democrats have lavished criticism on the administration's strategy in Iraq.
 
But among his major Republican competitors for the presidential nomination, McCain is right. Former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney has recently suggested that he, too, would take a different route in Iraq than the president, but McCain was clearly there first.
