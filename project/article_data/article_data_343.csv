Eric Hovde says U.S. has “six times more” oil than Saudi Arabia
","As Wisconsinites geared up to hit the highway for the Fourth of July, Republican U.S. Senate candidate Eric Hovde declared American energy independence as easy as 1, 2, 3.

Here’s the solution to high gas prices and overreliance on foreign oil, a
Hovde campaign news release said on July 2, 2012:

1.  ""Immediately tap into America’s natural resources: More than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia); 272 trillion cubic feet of natural gas; and more than half the world’s oil shale supply.""

2. ""End the moratorium on domestic drilling on public lands.""

3. ""Build the Keystone XL pipeline.""

There has been much debate about drilling on public lands and the Keystone XL pipeline, which would move oil sands crude from Canada to Gulf of Mexico refineries. But there’s been little discussion of the claim that America has an untapped domestic oil source that tops oil-rich Saudi Arabia by a factor of six.

Is Hovde right?

Hovde’s campaign pointed us to the Republican website for the House Natural Resources Committee, chaired by U.S. Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Washington).

""According to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) the U.S. holds more than half of the world’s oil shale resources,"" the site says. ""The most recent estimates (April, 2009) show the region may hold more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil – six times Saudi Arabia’s proven resources, and enough to provide the United States with energy for the next 200 years.""

Hovde, the committee website and the USGS are talking about the same thing -- the Green River Formation in Colorado, Utah and Wyoming. But each is using some critically different ways to describe it.

The Green River Formation is considered the world’s largest oil shale resource, but only sporadic attempts have been made to explore it -- typically when oil prices spike.

The reason: It’s not crude oil that lies beneath the surface, as in Saudi Arabia. It’s oil shale, a solid organic compound that can be converted to oil only when heated to great temperatures. The USGS made clear when it announced its findings in 2009.

Huge obstacles including costs, technology and environmental concerns have stood in the way.

Let’s start with the non-partisan source, the Geological Survey. Pressed by Congress during a gas-price spike several years ago, the survey analyzed the oil shale resource and determined the Colorado section of the formation by far the most promising.

They estimated that 1.525 trillion barrels of ""in-place oil shale resources"" lie in the Colorado section. That’s the number Hovde and the Republican website mention.

But each shortens that to ""oil"" -- and that’s a big difference. The Geological Survey describes oil shale as ""pre oil"" because it is not ready-made crude.

And the agency’s assessment made an important point: No economically viable extraction method is currently available in the United States, because the process is so technologically and environmentally challenging compared to conventional extraction of actual crude oil.

""Much of the resource in Colorado, where the richest deposits of high grade oil shale exist, are buried deep enough that mining is considered impractical or prohibitively difficult and expensive,"" said Justin Birdwell, a USGS research engineer studying the resource, in an interview. The focus, therefore has been on underground processing technologies, which are unproven.

Given this backdrop, the agency concluded in 2009 that it’s unknown how much of that 1.5 trillion barrels is recoverable. That’s still true today, although the agency is developing estimates. Recovery of oil is years or decades away, certainly not ""immediate"" as Hovde described it.

Additionally, when it comes to the Saudi Arabia comparison, Hovde runs into a major apples-to-oranges problem when he says the 1.5 trillion ""barrels of oil"" in the Green River Formation is ""six times more"" than in Saudi Arabia.

He is comparing Saudi Arabia’s 266 billion of ""proved resources"" with the 1.5 trillion in the Green River Formation -- but the latter number is only an estimate of the total ""in-place"" in the formation, without regard to the ability to get it out or get a viable price for it.

It’s a ""major distinction,"" as a Congressional Research Service paper on US fossil fuel resources noted in 2010.

""Proved reserves are those amounts of oil, natural gas, or coal that have been discovered and defined, typically by drilling wells or other exploratory measures, and which can be economically recovered,"" the study said.

In terms of proved reserves, the US has 20.7 billion barrels -- 13 times less than Saudi Arabia, according to the latest data from the Energy Information Administration, a US government agency.

The Republican website Hovde cites was more precise and cautious than the candidate. It said the region ""may hold"" more than 1.5 trillion barrels, and explicitly compared that to the Saudi’s ""proven"" resources.

Hovde omitted the qualifiers.

In any case, according to two Congressional Research Service studies, oil shale ""makes poor feedstock for making gasoline, so it might primarily be a source of other liquid middle distillate fuels such as jet fuel or diesel oil, fuels for which there is significant national demand.""

Finally, Hovde’s claim reminded us of a February 2012 item by PolitiFact National that rated Mostly False a claim by Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich. He said that by one estimate the United States  may have ""three times as much oil in the United States as there is in Saudi Arabia.""

That item noted the same apples-to-oranges problem in the comparison.

Our rating

Hovde suggested that we immediately tap into America’s natural resources, which he said are ""more than 1.5 trillion barrels of oil (six times more than Saudi Arabia).""

Hovde referred to a massive western United States formation of oil shale, and there’s a kernel of truth in that government officials estimate that 1.5 trillion barrels are contained there.

But Hovde omits a critical fact: He’s comparing that uncertain oil shale resource with Saudi oil reserves that have been discovered and defined and can be extracted economically. It’s unknown what the western formation will yield, and it certainly won’t come immediately.

Chris Christie says under new bill teachers who receive two negative evaluations lose tenure
","
Gov. Chris Christie didn’t get everything he had proposed from a tenure reform bill the state Legislature passed recently. But the Republican governor told a national audience this week teachers will lose tenure after receiving negative evaluations, one element of his education reform plan.

That’d be a win for the governor, if it were true.

But it’s not that simple.

Christie said after the New Jersey Education Association, the state’s largest teachers union, spent two years campaigning against his tenure reform proposals, they finally ""came to the table. And we negotiated New Jersey's tenure law, which is over 100 years old, the oldest tenure law for K to 12 education in the country, has now been reformed to say that if teachers get two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings they lose tenure,"" Christie said during a July 9 speech at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. ""We're putting accountability back into the system.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found teachers who receive negative evaluations may be fired, but under the legislation -- passed by both houses of the Legislature on June 25 but not yet signed by the governor -- teachers still have the right to appeal, the core job protection afforded by tenure.

Christie has described tenure as a job for life, but a process through which districts can fire teachers has always existed. Critics, however, argue the system is so costly and time-consuming that it deters districts from using it except in extreme cases of misconduct.

State law says tenured teachers cannot have their pay reduced or be fired except for inefficiency, incapacity, unbecoming conduct or other just cause, and then only after a hearing.

That does not change with the new legislation. Tenure charges are still subject to a hearing, though the process has been overhauled in an effort to make it easier to dismiss teachers.  

Michael Drewniak, a spokesman for Christie, said the governor ""did not go into full detail and, for the sake of brevity in a speech, merely abbreviated the process which clears the way for revocation of tenure.""  

""This is a sea change in the law,"" Drewniak said. ""Prior to the tenure bill, teachers could be removed for only a handful of reasons in a process that was massively expensive for school districts and ridiculously time consuming. For the first time, there is a statewide evaluation system that can be used to remove poor-performing teachers through a more streamlined process.""

The legislation creates an evaluation system with four possible ratings: ineffective, partially effective, effective and highly effective.

Superintendents will be required to file a charge of inefficiency against a teacher who receives either two consecutive ineffective ratings or a partially effective rating and then an ineffective rating the next year.

Superintendents, under exceptional circumstances, may defer filing tenure charges for a year against a teacher who receives two consecutive partially effective ratings or an ineffective rating and then a partially effective rating the next year.

But the charges must be filed if the teacher does not receive a positive evaluation the next year.

Still, tenured teachers facing a charge of inefficiency maintain the right to dispute those charges with a third-party, though the process has been changed. For instance, arbitrators, rather than administrative law judges, will now hear cases involving tenure charges.

We can’t know now whether that process will definitely make firing inefficient teachers easier, but what is clear is that tenure isn’t immediately revoked after two negative evaluations.

Our ruling

Christie said New Jersey’s teacher tenure law ""has now been reformed to say that if teachers get two years of partially effective or ineffective ratings they lose tenure.""

For the large part, superintendents must file tenure charges against teachers who receive two consecutive negative ratings on annual evaluations.

In those cases, teachers may ultimately be fired, but they don’t automatically lose their tenure and, therefore, maintain the right to appeal the charges levied against them.

We rate this claim False.

DCCC claims money from Chinese prostitution supports Jim Renacci's GOP majority
","
Billionaire Las Vegas casino owner Sheldon Adelson donates millions of dollars to Republican causes. A fired former employee of Adelson’s filed a lawsuit which alleges that Adelson personally approved of prostitution at properties his company owns in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that now is part of China.

Adelson vigorously denies those allegations.

What does any of that have to do with Rep. Jim Renacci?

Even though Federal Election Commission records show that Adelson hasn’t ever donated to Renacci, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee tried to use the casino owner’s legal woes against the Medina County congressman with a provocatively titled press release: ""Congressman Renacci’s Re-election Funded by Chinese Prostitution Money?""

""Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci’s Republican majority,"" the DCCC claimed in a news release on July 2, 2012.

""What will Congressman Jim Renacci do when his Chinese prostitution money comes from billionaire Sheldon Adelson?"" it continued, urging Renacci to ""reject the support of these groups funded by money from a Chinese prostitution strategy.""

As a result of redistricting, Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, Ohio, is pitted against Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat. That makes him a target for the DCCC.

The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn’t spent anything so far.

Adelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle. The NRCC regularly sends out news releases that attack Sutton, Renacci’s November election rival who is from Copley Township near Akron.

When we asked Renacci campaign spokesman James Slepian about the DCCC’s claim that the congressman’s re-election might somehow be funded by Chinese prostitution money, Slepian replied that there is ""no money from Chinese prostitutes, the Easter Bunny or the Tooth Fairy in our campaign coffers.""

""The DCCC's Chinese prostitution fantasy demonstrates that they are now fully immersed in the gutter and will literally say anything to avoid talking about Betty Sutton's lockstep support for the failed Obama economic agenda,"" Slepian said. ""This campaign needs to be about the economy and voting records, not fairy tales about Chinese hookers.""

The allegations that Adelson signed off on prostitution at his properties in Macau were raised last month during a lawsuit filed by former Sands executive Steven Jacobs, who was fired from overseeing those properties in July 2010. Associated Press reported that Jacobs’ lawsuit accuses Adelson of breach of contract and pushing him into illegal activity.

A court filing from Jacobs says he tried to rid the casino floor of ""loan sharks and prostitution"" while he worked there, which upset senior executives who informed him that ""the prior prostitution strategy had been personally approved by Adelson.""

A spokesman for the Adelson’s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always ""maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson’s character.""

In a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine,  Adelson said there’s not a ""shred of evidence"" to back his former employee’s charges, and ""says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) have given millions of dollars to set up clinics around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the … claims even more preposterous.""  Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau.

Do unproven charges by a disgruntled former Adelson employee coupled with Adelson’s generosity to GOP groups that are likely to back Renacci justify the DCCC’s claim that ""foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci’s Republican majority?"" 
We don’t think so.

The root of the allegation stems from a fired employee’s claim that Adelson allowed prostitution to be present in a casino in Macau. Based on that, the DCCC claims that Adelson, one of the wealthiest people in America, made political contributions with cash from prostitution revenues. And then the claim invokes Renacci’s name as part of the Republican majority that this tainted money is supposedly supporting.

Renacci hasn’t accepted money from Adelson and doesn’t control contributions to the GOP groups that support him.

The claim that Adelson’s donations to these other groups amount to ""Chinese prostitution money"" is dubious enough that inserting the word ""allegedly"" can’t save it.

TV ad says health law's cost is $2 trillion, 'double what we were promised'
","
A new ad attacks Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., on the health care law and claims to have ""the facts."" Then it trots out a series of distortions.

""Florida patients and seniors deserve to know what are the facts about President Barack Obama’s health care law,"" the ad says. ""Fact: Bill Nelson was the deciding vote. The bill could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised. Nelson’s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage. Tell Bill Nelson: Protect Florida patients, repeal the health care law.""

The ad is from an outside spending group called American Commitment, which says on its website that it supports ""free markets, economic growth, constitutionally limited government, property rights, and individual freedom."" It’s a 501(c)4, so it doesn’t have to disclose its donors. (For more details about American Commitment’s connections and spending, check out this report from the Washington Post.)

We fact-checked several of the ad’s claims: that Nelson was the deciding vote on health care (Mostly False) and that the law ""imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class"" (Pants on Fire.) Previously, we've also looked at claims about cutting $500 billion from Medicare (Mostly False) and millions losing coverage (False).

Here, we’ll examine the claim that the law ""could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised.""

We asked American Commitment for evidence for its charges, but we didn’t hear back. Tiny print that flashes by on the screen -- we read it only by pausing the YouTube video -- says the claim is from ""Congressional Budget Office Estimate.""

Even though American Commitment didn’t respond to our queries, we easily found similar statements about the health care law costing up to $2 trillion.

Though the claim is repeated often, it’s not accurate.

First, some background on the Congressional Budget Office. It’s a nonpartisan, widely respected agency with an expert staff that generates projections and reports about how proposed laws affect the federal budget. It works with another agency, the Joint Committee on Taxation, that is charged with looking at the effects of various taxes on the federal budget.
   
The Congressional Budget Office is not always right in its projections. In recent years, for example, it overestimated how much it would cost to cover prescription drugs for seniors in Medicare. The program actually came in under projections.
   
But for claims about federal spending, we consider the Congressional Budget Office, often called the CBO, to be the standard by which we fact-check claims.

The CBO updates its reports and projections from time to time, and one of its updates on the health care law was released March 14, 2012.

In that report, the CBO increased its projections of the costs under the new law. Most of the costs will come in the form of tax credits to help people of modest income buy health insurance, or in outright spending to enroll the poor in Medicaid, a government-run insurance program.

Critics of the law seized on the line from the report that the law’s ""provisions related to insurance coverage are now projected to have a net cost of $1,252 billion over the 2012-2022 period; that amount represents a gross cost to the federal government of $1,762 billion."" (Read the CBO’s update for yourself.)

The ad upgrades that $1,762 billion, or $1.762 trillion to $2 trillion. In this case, we won’t quibble about $240 billion, because the $1.76 trillion number itself is extreme cherry-picking. It doesn’t account for the law’s tax increases, spending cuts or other cost-saving measures. 
In fact, the CBO has said that overall the health care bill actually reduces government spending by about $124 billion over 10 years. 
Still, this $1.76 trillion number gained traction quickly and started spreading around the Internet and into comments from the law’s opponents.

The Congressional Budget Office soon released a statement to set the record straight. Here’s part of what it said:

CBO released two reports this week related to the analysis of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) conducted by CBO and the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). One report presented updated estimates for the insurance coverage provisions of the ACA, and the other responded to questions we’ve received regarding the effects of the ACA on employment-based health insurance.

Some of the commentary on those reports has suggested that CBO and JCT have changed their estimates of the effects of the ACA to a significant degree. That’s not our perspective. ...

For the provisions of the Affordable Care Act related to health insurance coverage, CBO and JCT’s latest estimates are quite similar to the estimates we released when the legislation was being considered in March 2010.

After the U.S. Supreme Court found the health care law constitutional, the CBO announced it would revise its findings on the health care law. Those findings are scheduled for release during the week of July 23, 2012.

Finally, our fellow fact-checkers at FactCheck.org created their own set of estimates, specifically comparing the CBO’s original set of gross-cost estimates from 2010 with the estimates released in 2012. FactCheck.org found the estimates increased by 8.6 percent -- a far cry from doubling.

Our ruling

The TV ad says that the health care law ""could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised."" Actually, only part of the health care law -- the gross costs -- could cost up to $1.76 trillion. That’s only a slight increase from what was originally promised -- not close to double.

The number also doesn’t account for the portions of the law that pay for that spending, both new taxes and cost reductions.

The ad’s source -- the Congressional Budget Office -- specifically rebutted the charge that the costs had doubled, and they issued that rebuttal months ago. The CBO said that its latest estimates ""are quite similar to the estimates we released when the legislation was being considered in March 2010.""

We rate this statement False. 
Update: This report has been corrected to clarify the projections of gross costs as distinct from the insurance coverage provisions. The rating remains the same.",/factchecks/2012/jul/11/american-commitment/tv-ad-says-health-laws-cost-2-trillion-double-what/

Did your kid just drink 16 packs of sugar?
","
In recent days we’ve heard a revival of an age-old question that highlights our nation’s shared love of sugar yet calls out our regional differences: Is it pop or is it soda? Or maybe it’s just Coke? 

While in bubbly debate over what to call soft drinks -- your PolitiFact Oregon staff does not agree on this -- a colleague of ours suggested a potential fact check that anyone might find intriguing, no matter what they call their carbonated beverage of choice. You’ve probably seen the ""Sugar Packs"" ads around Multnomah County, put there by the Health Department as part of a healthy living and anti-obesity campaign that started in 2010.

It’s the one with a pile of packets of white sugar draining into a 20-ounce bottle of generic cola. ""Your kid just ate 16 packs of sugar,"" the ad states. ""All those extra calories can bring on obesity, diabetes and heart disease.""

Sixteen packets? Our collective stomachs cramped. Our teeth ached. We swallowed our distaste and started checking.

Soda-sleuthing turned out to be quite easy, namely because there’s a lot of pop in a newsroom. In fact, we found more than a dozen empties within spitting distance. A 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola regular, we learned, contains 39 grams of sugar, usually from high-fructose corn syrup in the United States. A 20-ounce bottle would then contain 65 grams of sugar.  

Corn syrup is not the same as white table sugar, but the county is talking equivalents. A packet of table sugar as shown in the ad is equal to about a teaspoon, or about 4 grams of sugar. So, indeed, there are at least 16 packs of sugar in every 20-ounce bottle of regular cola.

There’s no arguing that that’s a large chunk of sweet. The American Heart Association recommends no more than nine teaspoons -- nine packets -- of added sugar a day for adult men. For women, it’s six.

But just for the fun of it -- no, we’re not on a sugar high -- we wanted to know what else could contain the equivalent of 16 packets of granulated white. And bingo: A 16-ounce Jamba Juice Banana Berry contains 60 grams of sugar.  A 12-ounce Chocolate McCafe shake from McDonald’s has 76 grams.

A Starbucks Grande non-fat, no-whip Caramel Frappucino Blended Beverage contains 59 grams of sugar, although to be fair, the drink also includes 4 grams of nutritious protein. The iced lemon pound cake contains 46 grams of sugar -- but then, all you adults knew that -- and PolitiFact Oregon has fallen into tangential research.

Back to the point.

We figure children don’t usually indulge in diet sodas, which are made with artificial sweeteners like aspartame, and not with corn syrup or sugar. We’re told by a beverage trade publication that 12-ounce cans are the top sellers -- but a 20-ounce bottle doesn’t seem out of line in this age of super-sized drinks and Double Big Gulps.

""It’s what’s available in our environment,"" said Sonia Manhas, who manages the program for the county.

After all, McDonald’s markets a 16-ounce soda as a small-sized soft drink and a 12-ounce drink as child-sized. We figure parents are smart enough to figure out the sugar-gram-to-cola-ounce ratio themselves. The smaller the drink, the fewer the sugar packets.

All this really means is that we find the county’s statement accurate. We rate it True. And that’s the unsugar-coated truth. ",/factchecks/2012/jul/11/multnomah-county/did-your-kid-just-drink-16-packs-sugar/

Roger Williams says $765,828 in federal money spent to subsidize pancakes for Washington yuppies
","
Roger Williams, facing a July 31, 2012, runoff against Wes Riddle for the Republican nomination in the state’s 25th Congressional District, vows in a mailer to voters that he’d ""just say no"" to wasteful spending.

His mailer lists as objectionable expenditures half a dozen items including the nearly $800 billion economic stimulus package sought by President Barack Obama in 2009. As we’ve written before, various experts credit the stimulus with protecting or creating jobs.

A reader asked, though, if other items on Williams’ list hold up such as purported spending on a remake of ""Sesame Street"" in Pakistan; a New York video game preservation center; an art exhibition in Italy; a documentary on how rock music fed the collapse of the Soviet Union; and a study of how college students use mobile devices for social networking.

For this article, we’re chomping solely on the mailer’s tastiest claim -- $765,828 in federal spending to ""subsidize ‘pancakes for yuppies’ in the nation’s capital.""

A caveat: We’re not going to judge whether the proclaimed expenditure is wasteful. That’s Williams’ opinion.

Still: Pancakes for yuppies, supported by Uncle Sam?

We'll accept that Washington has its share of yuppies; Merriam-Webster defines a yuppie as a ""young college-educated adult who is employed in a well-paying profession and who lives and works in or near a large city.""

Williams’ mailer offers as its basis a Dec. 20, 2011 online announcement by U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., of his ""Wastebook 2011"" report. The report includes a short chapter stating that the hundreds of thousands of federal dollars were provided to help build an International House of Pancakes restaurant in the Columbia Heights section of Washington, breaking down to $500,000 ""as an equity injection in DC Pancakes LLC for a 19 percent ownership interest"" in the project with remaining funds going to ""training costs for new employees, and other consultants.""

Coburn’s report says Columbia Heights, which is north and west of the Capitol, ""has become a local shopping hot spot for some and ― one of Washington‘s more desirable neighborhoods. Other businesses in the area include Target, Bed Bath and Beyond, Best Buy, and Starbucks.""

Coburn says in his footnotes that he drew on a Nov. 24, 2010, commentary in the conservative Washington Examiner and research by the non-partisan Congressional Research Service, which apparently confirmed the grant amounts and purposes.

In the Examiner article, writer David Freddoso quotes Butch Hopkins, who was then CEO of the Anacostia Economic Development Corp., as saying that his organization had applied for and received the grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services in 2009 to invest in the restaurant in exchange for a minority equity stake. Freddoso questions the benefit to taxpayers of subsidizing the restaurant’s creation in a neighborhood, he writes, that was already a popular yuppie shopping, dining and drinking locale. It quotes Acting HHS Assistant Secretary David Hansell, on hand at the IHOP’s opening, as saying that a lot of folks came out looking for jobs there.

We sought to confirm the grant and then to gauge if it’s reasonable to characterize the restaurant as catering to yuppies.

The economic development corporation, founded in 1969, says it has developed single and multi-family housing, neighborhood retail and office projects and a shopping center to serve residents living in Washington east of the Anacostia River. On a web page, the corporation says it teamed with an investment company to open the IHOP restaurant, drawing on support from HHS’s Office of Community Services. ""This venture will employ over 150 DC residents,"" the web entry says, ""the majority of which are from AEDC’s primary target area in Ward 8,"" which is mostly in southeast Washington.

By email, HHS spokesman Kenneth Wolfe told us the agency gave a $765,828 Community Economic Development grant to the economic development corporation, which proposed to spend $500,000 from the grant to make a 30 percent equity ownership investment in the Jackson Investment Company to build and open an IHOP in Columbia Heights, creating 70 full-time jobs for low-income individuals otherwise eligible for Temporary Aid to Needy Families. A summary Wolfe provided says the grant would leverage about $2 million in other funds, about which he did not elaborate.

We weren’t sure how to determine whether the IHOP caters to yuppies.

Generally, according to news accounts, Columbia Heights appears to be gaining retail momentum after decades of disuse in the wake of  riots and fires that broke out after the April 1968 assassination of the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. A Jan. 9, 2005, news article in the Washington Post, described the local residents as diverse, singling out mostly poor immigrant and African American teenagers. A Nov. 21, 2010, Post news article on the initial onslaught of applicants to work at the IHOP, on Irving Street near 14th Street NW, describes it as located in ""fast-gentrifying Columbia Heights -- home to Target, Best Buy and a gastropub featuring $7 pints of British draft beer."" A Dec. 21, 2011, Huffington Post story about Coburn’s criticism of the federal grant says the IHOP is in a ""massive Columbia Heights shopping center, part of a major mixed-use redevelopment of a once-vibrant commercial corridor that had been fairly barren even years after a Green Line Metrorail station opened.""

By telephone, IHOP corporate spokeswoman Becky Madeira said the neighborhood is so diverse, it would be a mischaracterization to say the restaurant caters to yuppies. ""There is a diversity of ages and a broad band of ethnicities"" in the area, Madeira said.

In a telephone interview, Tyoka Jackson, the local franchisee, told us the restaurant employs 100 workers: ""We took people who were on welfare, who were unemployed, we’re talking ex-offenders, military, single mothers and fathers, and they have jobs now. To me, as a taxpayer, that is money well spent.""

Jackson also said his customers are a diverse mix. ""I would never characterize it as yuppie,"" Jackson said, adding that if Williams is in Washington, he’s welcome to see for himself. ""If he wins, I would suggest he come in and have a stack of pancakes and take a look at who is sitting around him... not only who is sitting around him, but who is serving him,"" Jackson said.

Finally, J.B. Wogan of PolitiFact in Washington scouted the restaurant at about 9 a.m. on a weekday.

Wogan reported back that the surroundings have tell-tale signs of ""yuppy-ism"": a bike rack out front, a tea shop across the street, a Bed, Bath and Beyond next door, two Starbucks within short walks, a Vitamin Shoppe and a Panera Bread nearby. Also, there are four banks within a two-minute walk, perhaps a sign that people living or working in the area have money to deposit and withdraw.

And as Wogan entered the IHOP, he encountered a white man in a teal plaid shirt carrying a laptop. Then again, he also counted four older black women, two teenage boys and two families. And despite an advertisement for free Wi-Fi, no one had a laptop out. No one appeared to be on break from a white-collar job -- Wogan was the only customer wearing a button-down shirt.

Maybe Wogan stopped in at the wrong time or on the wrong day. Still, he didn’t spot yuppies eating pancakes.

Williams’ campaign did not respond to an inquiry about this claim.

Our ruling

A $765,828 federal grant helped an IHOP open in a part of the capital that has been gaining retail cachet. It makes sense, too, that the restaurant’s customers include yuppies. Who doesn’t like pancakes?

But the intimation that the grant was awarded just to satisfy yuppie appetites fails to acknowledge that people of all stripes (and ages and income levels) order short stacks. Also, the grant enabled dozens of down-and-out individuals to land jobs -- a result not acknowledged in the campaign mailer.

""Florida patients and seniors deserve to know what are the facts about President Barack Obama’s health care law,"" the ad says. ""Fact: Bill Nelson was the deciding vote. The bill could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised. Nelson’s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage. Tell Bill Nelson: Protect Florida patients, repeal the health care law.""

The ad is from an outside spending group called American Commitment, which said on its website that it supports ""free markets, economic growth, constitutionally limited government, property rights, and individual freedom."" It’s a 501(c)4, so it doesn’t have to disclose its donors. (For more details about American Commitment’s connections and spending, check out this report from the Washington Post.)

We fact-checked the claim that Nelson was the deciding vote in another fact-check, rating it Mostly False. We've also looked at claims about cutting $500 billion from Medicare (Mostly False) and millions losing coverage (False). 
Here, we’re fact-checking whether the health care law ""imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class.""

We asked American Commitment for evidence for its charges, but we didn’t hear back.

We found the same claim, though, on several conservative blogs. Their basis for making the claim focused on the tax penalty that’s part of the health care law, the penalty imposed on people who go without health insurance.

The individual mandate as tax penalty

Here’s how it works: Starting in 2014, individuals who do not have health insurance and who aren't exempt (say, for cases of hardship or religious belief) will have to pay an annual penalty of at least $95. The amount increases, though, up to $695 in 2016. After 2016, the amount would be indexed to inflation and could be higher -- up to 2.5 percent of household income.

Critics of the law have pointed out, correctly, that some people who make less than $250,000 will be subject to this tax penalty. During the 2008 campaign, Obama pledged not to raise taxes on families who make less than that.

The blogs said that 75 percent of the people who pay the penalty are in the middle class, so that makes it the biggest middle-class tax increase in history. This is a logical fallacy -- just because 75 percent of the households who pay the tax are in the middle class, that doesn’t automatically make it the largest middle-class tax increase in history.

But let’s set that problem aside for moment so we can explore who’s paying the mandate. Then we’ll get to other problems with the ad’s claim.

Who pays the individual mandate’s tax penalty

The Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation -- two nonpartisan federal offices -- have estimated that about 4 million uninsured Americans will have to pay the penalty, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019.

The CBO projections show that 76 percent of the people paying the penalty will have a household income of 500 percent of the federal poverty level or below. For a family of four, that comes to about $120,000.

We should note that there is no standard definition of ""the middle class."" We looked at projections from the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center for what the federal income distribution will look like in 2016. A chart from the center estimates that the threshold for the top 20 percent of income in 2016 will be $123,970. So statements like these essentially define ""middle class"" as the bottom 80 percent of the income scale.

But there’s a different way to look at who pays the penalty, and that’s as a tally of dollars paid, rather than the number of households.

The CBO projected that the bottom 80 percent will pay 46 percent of the tax dollars collected as a result of the mandate. That’s compared to 55 percent of revenues that will come from the top 20 percent.

This presents a different picture of how the financial burden of the mandate will be borne. There’s a big difference between the ""middle class"" carrying 75 percent of the burden rather than 46 percent of the burden.

Two tax experts -- Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center and William McBride of the Tax Foundation -- agreed with our analysis when we looked at a similar claim. They also indicated that, it’s more appropriate to use dollars paid than the number of households that have to pay the penalty.

Other taxes dwarf the mandate

Now we come to another problem with the ad’s claim -- whether the tax increases in the law are the largest in history.

It’s true that some middle-class people will pay the tax penalty for not having insurance. But as we noted earlier, that penalty is intended to encourage people to get insurance. It’s not intended to raise enough money to pay for the bulk of new spending in the health care law. Other tax increases do that.

Most of those tax increases are on the wealthy and the health-care industry -- not the middle class.

Starting in 2013, high earners -- defined as households making make more than $250,000 or single people making more than $200,000 -- will see their Medicare payroll taxes increase 0.9 percentage points, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. Also, people at these income levels pay a new tax on investment income of 3.8 percent.

The 10-year tally: $210.2 billion. That easily outpaces $4 billion per year that comes from the individual mandate.

For other new taxes in the law, it’s less clear how the burden will fall. These taxes include annual fees on health insurance providers ($60.1 billion over 10 years); a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers ($27 billion over 10 years); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion over 10 years); a higher floor for medical expense deductions on itemized income tax returns ($15.2 billion over 10 years); and an excise tax on indoor tanning services ($2.7 billion over 10 years).

Also, there’s a 40 percent excise tax on high-cost health plans, so-called ""Cadillac plans,"" which begins in 2018, raising $32 billion in 2018 and 2019.

Largest tax increase?

Finally, the health care law is not the largest tax increase in history. We looked into this topic in detail when we fact-checked Rush Limbaugh’s statement that the health care law is ""the largest tax increase in the history of the world.""

That detailed analysis can be found here, but the bottom line is this:

Depending on your rounding, tax increases resulting from the health care law are about the size of tax increases proposed and passed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter, in 1990 by President George H.W. Bush and in 1993 by President Bill Clinton.
       
The health care law’s tax increases are smaller than tax increases signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1982 and a temporary tax signed into law in 1968 by President Lyndon B. Johnson. And they are significantly smaller than two tax increases passed during World War II and a tax increase passed in 1961.
       
It’s true that the tax increases in the health care legislation do reverse a trend of federal tax cuts and represent the first significant tax increases since 1993.

But they are not the largest in the history of the United States.

Our ruling

The ad calls the health care law ""the largest tax increase in history on the middle class."" Actually, the law is not the largest tax increase in history, and most of its taxes fall on the wealthy and the health care industry.

Even if all of the taxes in the health care law fell on the middle class -- which they don’t -- the statement still wouldn’t be accurate.

Another outside group says Bill Nelson was the deciding vote
","
Yet another conservative outside spending group is targeting Florida’s Democratic incumbent, U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson, with distorted claims about the health care law.

This time, the group is called American Commitment. The ad claims to have ""the facts,"" but then trots out several distortions we’ve already debunked.

""Florida patients and seniors deserve to know what are the facts about President Barack Obama’s health care law,"" the ad says. ""Fact: Bill Nelson was the deciding vote. The bill could cost up to $2 trillion, double what we were promised. Nelson’s health care vote imposes the largest tax increase in history on the middle class, cuts $500 billion from Medicare to pay for new government programs, and millions could lose their current coverage. Tell Bill Nelson: Protect Florida patients, repeal the health care law.""

On its website, American Commitment says it supports ""free markets, economic growth, Constitutionally-limited government, property rights, and individual freedom"" and advertises connections to other conservative groups like the Club for Growth and Americans for Prosperity.  It’s a 501(c)4, so it doesn’t have to disclose its donors. (For more details about American Commitment’s connections and spending, check out this report from the Washington Post.)

We asked American Commitment for evidence for its charges, but we didn’t hear back.

Here, we’re going to look at whether Nelson was the deciding vote. We fact-checked this statement in June 2012 when another outside spending group made the same charge. 
We've also fact-checked the ad's statement that the law was the largest tax increase in history on the middle class. We rated that Pants on Fire. And, we've previously looked at claims about cutting $500 billion from Medicare (Mostly False) and millions losing coverage (False).

The 2009 health care vote
   
There’s no doubt that the health care law was passed with several very close votes. One of the key votes happened on Dec. 24, 2009, when 59 Democrats and one independent voted together in favor of the bill. (Sixty votes were needed for a preliminary cloture vote to prevent filibusters.)

Nelson was among the 60 senators who voted for the bill to go forward.

Opponents of the law have argued that any of those 60 cast the deciding vote, because every vote was needed to pass the bill.

We find that argument unpersuasive, because there’s evidence in the record to show that some of those votes were more critical than others.
   
As we noted before, there is a long history of senators holding back their votes until their demands are met. On the health care law, some senators did hold out until the last minute -- but Nelson wasn’t one of them.
   
One of the detailed reports we’ve seen on the final negotiations for the law is from the Los Angeles Times. According to its report, some of the most crucial votes came from Sen. Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.; Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb.; and Sen. Russ Feingold, D-Wis.
   
According to the newspaper, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., ""knew that he had to keep Lieberman in the tent. And the next night, when Democrats gathered for a special caucus meeting, Reid did not call out the Connecticut senator, focusing instead on the need to unite and move forward.""
   
At the meeting, Reid turned to Nelson of Nebraska, who also ""had a long list of demands, including more restrictions on funding abortions and full federal funding to expand Nebraska's Medicaid program. ... Reid was closing in on a deal.""
   
Suddenly, another roadblock appeared: Republican opponents of the bill threatened to filibuster -- that is, indefinitely block consideration of -- an unrelated defense appropriations bill as a way of indirectly delaying the health care measure. To get around that, Reid had to persuade Feingold -- an opponent of the defense bill for substantive reasons -- not to join the Republican blockade.
   
""Reid was unwilling to challenge Feingold on a vote of conscience,"" the Los Angeles Times reported. ""And when Democrats gathered for yet another special caucus meeting ... Reid was ready to concede defeat. But as dejected senators began to leave, Feingold arose: He would put aside his convictions on the war, he said, and vote with his party. 'I don't think there was a dry eye in the caucus room,' said Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin, D-Md.""
   
There was also a concern about whether Sen. Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., would physically be able to reach the chamber because he had been in the hospital with a staph infection. But he was brought in in a wheelchair and voted.

We found several other news articles that focused on Nebraska's Nelson as the final key for Senate Democrats in 2009. He announced his support days before the Christmas Eve vote, after he reached a compromise about abortion and federal funding for his state. But in March 2010 the Nebraska senator voted against the final bill.
   
The Nebraska senator told CNN in December 2009: ""I couldn’t create the opportunity to be the 60th vote. It happened. … If you think it’s fun having both sides on an issue mad at you when you are trying to do something in good faith, just think it’s like going home and getting bit by the family dog. So who enjoys that?"" Ben Nelson is retiring and not running for re-election.

Bill Nelson’s role
   
In the summer of 2009, Florida’s Bill Nelson was quiet about health care reform -- angering some Democratic activists. But in September he jumped into the fray -- offering amendments about Medicare Advantage and Medicare drug benefits. Nelson sounded cautiously supportive in news accounts -- saying he had some criticisms but called the bill a ""starting point.""
   
""There are serious issues to be resolved,"" Nelson said in a speech on the floor of the Senate in September 2009. ""This senator is optimistic, and I believe that we are going to be able to achieve this goal of expanding affordable health care to nearly all Americans.""
   
In October 2009, Nelson joined other Democrats on the Senate Finance Committee in voting for the health care plan. Nelson called the package a ""good start.""
   
In November during public stops in the Tampa Bay area, he predicted the Senate would pass a health care bill and said: ""If we don't do something about health care, it's going to run our country into bankruptcy."" The Orlando Sentinel described him as an ""enthusiastic cheerleader for the emerging legislation.""
   
After the December vote, the health care bill still needed changes and another round of approvals. Nelson’s office issued a press release in March 2010 saying that despite the legislation’s ""flaws"" -- including that it didn’t force drug makers to reduce the costs of prescriptions -- he would support it.
   
""Nelson, who had been considered by some to be a possible swing vote, made his declaration just at the outset of Senate starting its deliberations on changes to the health care signed into law by President Obama yesterday,"" stated Nelson’s press release.
   
When we fact-checked this claim previously, Nelson Senate spokesman Dan McLaughlin told PolitiFact Florida in an email: ""There’s no way every Democratic senator could have cast the ‘deciding vote.’ And there’s no way to say Bill Nelson cast the deciding vote -- when he didn’t. Nelson didn’t like the bill. He tried to improve it. Among other things, he offered an amendment against the drug-makers. And, he announced his vote well before the roll call. He played no extraordinary role in the final passage.""

Our ruling
   
American Commitment says that Florida Sen. Bill Nelson cast the ""deciding vote"" for health care. The health care law required 60 votes, so Nelson's vote was crucial -- as were the other 59 votes. But describing Nelson as the ""deciding vote"" suggests he had some extraordinarily powerful role, and that’s not the case. Nelson had cautiously been a supporter for months as he tried to amend the law.

"['Civil Rights', 'Elections', 'Legal Issues', 'Texas', 'Eric Holder']","
Eric Holder says recent studies show 25 percent of African Americans, 8 percent of whites lack government-issued photo IDs
","
Addressing the NAACP at its annual convention in Houston, Attorney General Eric Holder stressed his commitment to battling states such as Texas seeking to put in place laws requiring citizens to show a government-approved photo ID before voting at the polls.

According to the prepared text of his July 10, 2012, speech, Holder recapped the Justice Department’s decision not to approve the Texas law’s implementation after deciding it would be harmful to minority voters. Separately, the State of Texas, led by its attorney general, Greg Abbott, has sued the government toward winning judicial approval of the law, which the Republican-led Legislature approved in 2011.

Holder credited the NAACP with ""working to raise awareness about the potential impact of this and other similar laws, and the fact that – according to some recent studies – nationally, only 8 percent of white voting-age citizens, while 25 percent of African-American voting-age citizens, lack a government-issued photo ID. In our efforts to protect voting rights and to prevent voting fraud, we will be vigilant and strong. But let me be clear: We will not allow political pretexts to disenfranchise American citizens of their most precious right.""

We asked the Justice Department how Holder reached his percentages and didn’t immediately hear back.

But the references to 8 percent and 25 percent, respectively, were familiar to us.

In a January 2012 fact check, we rated Mostly True a claim by Democratic U.S. Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and John Lewis of Georgia that up to ""one in four African Americans do not carry the necessary forms of identification to vote"" under the conditions of state photo ID laws.

At the time, we noted that the figure originated in a 2006 survey by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University’s School of Law.
   
The center combines research and legal advocacy on public policy issues such as campaign finance reform and racial balance in criminal law, and it has said that state efforts to require photo IDs from voters at the polls could discourage millions from voting, especially minority and low-income Americans. In an October 2011 report, the center said that in five states where photo ID laws were scheduled to take effect in 2012, some 3.2 million Americans, accounting for about 10 percent of the states’ voting-age residents, lacked government-issued photo IDs.
   
Two of those states -- Texas and South Carolina -- must have their laws cleared by the U.S. Department of Justice because of past failures to protect minority voting rights. The department rejected South Carolina’s law in December 2011 (saying that minority registered voters were more likely than whites to lack state IDs) and declined to bless the Texas law in March 2012.

The Texas law would require voters to show a valid government-issued photo ID, such as a Texas driver's license, Department of Public Safety identification card, state concealed handgun license, U.S. military ID or U.S. passport.
   
Back to the nationwide data: The center’s 2006 survey reached by telephone 987 U.S. citizens of voting age, asking them questions including, ""Do you have a current, unexpired government-issued ID with your picture on it, like a driver’s license or a military ID?""
   
As voter ID debates heated up in 2011, the conservative Heritage Foundation issued a critique of the survey, noting it was still frequently cited and questioning its decision not to focus on registered or actual voters. The Brennan Center’s response said in part, ""While it is true that citizens in those groups are more likely to vote in any given election, they are not the only citizens who have the right to vote.""
   
Overall, according to the survey, 11 percent of voting-age Americans did not have current government-issued photo ID. Among African Americans, 25 percent did not have such ID, compared to 8 percent of whites. Not enough Hispanics were surveyed to reach reliable conclusions about that subgroup, the center said.
   
In a December 2011 report, the NAACP mentioned the 25-percent figure from the 2006 survey, going on to say that factors in individuals not having IDs may include the cost of getting a photo ID (because minorities are over-represented in the poor population) or a lack of the documents needed to apply for the photo ID, such as birth certificates (not issued to many African Americans born before the Civil Rights Act passed), which also can cost money to obtain.
       
When we looked into the Democrats’ claim, we found no other national surveys by race of which U.S. citizens eligible to vote have government-issued photo IDs. Two national surveys taken in 2008, however, checked on registered voters.  
   
Before the 2008 presidential election, researchers from the University of Washington and other schools carried out a national telephone survey of 4,563 registered voters. In the survey, 10 percent of blacks, 11 percent of Hispanics and 5 percent of whites said they did not have a valid driver's license or an ID issued by their home state.
   
Another survey, reaching 10,000 registered voters via phone and Internet after the 2008 election, included questions about driver’s license ownership by race. In an Aug. 30, 2011, blog post, Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart III said responses showed that 19 percent of black respondents and 3 percent of whites did not have a driver’s license. In his blog post, Stewart did not break out results for Hispanic respondents.
   
Among half a dozen other studies, ranging in scope from three counties to three states, several struck us as having limited applicability:  
  
Two other surveys asked questions closest to matching the statement by Holder.
   
A 2007 survey of Indiana’s voting-age citizens found 26.6 percent of blacks and 13.6 percent of whites did not have a ""current"" government-issued or state university-issued photo ID.
   
A 2008 survey of registered voters in Indiana, Mississippi and Maryland found 3.8 percent of blacks and 0.9 percent of whites did not have government-issued photo IDs.
   
Our ruling
   
Holder’s figures appear to trace to a single national survey taken about six years ago though, far as we can tell, mostly unchallenged since.

Other collections of data do not touch on exactly the same points, but most indicate that African Americans are less likely than whites to hold varied kinds of government-issued IDs, with percentages of blacks without such IDs ranging from nearly 4 percent to more than 26 percent and percentages of whites having such an ID ranging from 1 percent to nearly 14 percent.

Wisconsin GOP U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy says ""Obamacare"" law ""slashed $500 billion from Medicare""
","
On June 6, 2012, Wisconsin Democrat Pat Kreitlow huffed and puffed in declaring that U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., ""voted twice to end Medicare.""

It was a claim, made numerous times about others, that PolitiFact National labeled its Lie of the Year for 2011. Kreitlow, who is challenging Duffy in the November 2012 election, earned a Pants on Fire for his version.

A day later, Duffy fumed over Kreitlow’s support of President Barack Obama’s health care reform law, saying it ""slashed $500 billion from Medicare.""

That has been another popular claim for the Truth-O-Meter.

Let’s see whether Duffy is spouting anything more than hot air.

Past claims

The first phases of the health care reform law, which was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court in June 2012, took effect in March 2010.

Six months later, the 60 Plus Association, a conservative advocacy group for senior citizens, began running TV ads against Democratic members of Congress from Wisconsin and other states who voted for it.

The claim? The law ""will cut $500 billion from Medicare"" and ""hurt the quality"" of care for seniors.

PolitiFact National found the law does not take $500 billion out of the current Medicare budget, but reduces the growth of Medicare spending by just over $500 billion over 10 years.

In rating the claim Mostly False, our colleagues noted that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will rise to $929 billion in 2020, an increase of $430 million over actual spending in 2009.

So, Medicare spending continues to increase, but not by as much as it would have without the reform law.

The claims of a $500 billion cut to Medicare, however, have continued.

In May 2012, a Republican Ohio congressman accused a Democratic Ohio congresswoman of having ""gutted Medicare by $500 billion"" by voting for the health care reform law. PolitiFact Ohio rated the claim Mostly False, noting that Medicare spending would have grown at a faster rate without the law.

The same month, PolitiFact Florida gave a Mostly False to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce for saying ""seniors will see $500 billion in Medicare cuts to fund ‘Obamacare.’"" Our colleagues found that slowing the growth in Medicare spending is intended to offset, to some extent, the overall cost of the law.

(For a comprehensive look at Medicare and claims made about it, read ""The PolitiFact guide to Medicare attack lines."")

Duffy claim

Duffy's made his claim in a news release issued June 7, 2012 to criticize Kreitlow's support of the health care reform law. Regarding the law's effect on Medicare, Duffy said:

""Kreitlow's full-throated support for the government’s unwarranted takeover of healthcare slashed $500 billion from Medicare, too.""

(Claims that Obama's law is a government takeover of health care was PolitiFact National's Lie of the Year for 2010.)

Duffy campaign manager Justin Richards argued that ""slashed"" is an accurate way of describing how the law reduces the growth in Medicare spending. But even though some of the news article excerpts Richards cited referred to cuts, he acknowledged that the reductions are in the growth of future spending.

Our rating

Duffy said the federal health care reform law ""slashed $500 billion from Medicare.""

There is an element of truth in his statement because Medicare spending will grow by about $500 billion less than it would have without the law. But the law has not already reduced Medicare spending by $500 billion, as Duffy suggests.

"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Robert Menendez']","
U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez claims health care reform will mean $250 million in savings over the first 10 years, $1.2 trillion over the second decade
","
It didn’t take long after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the health care reform law for U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez to revive a questionable talking point about the potential savings from the legislation.

In the hours following the court decision, the Democratic senator claimed health care reform policies will lower the federal deficit by more than $1 trillion over the next 20 years.

""So the reality is the Congressional Budget Office says we save $250 million over the first 10 years. Over the next 10 years, we save $1.2 trillion in savings in terms of health care,"" Menendez said in a June 28 interview on the Regional News Network’s Richard French Live.

Menendez is correct in his overall point that budget office projections indicate health care reform policies will likely lower federal deficits. But the senator made a couple of mistakes in citing those specific figures, PolitiFact New Jersey found. 
Our PolitiFact colleagues debunked similar claims by other Democrats in 2010, including one from President Barack Obama.

First, let’s discuss the projected deficit reduction in the first decade.

The Affordable Care Act and related legislation contain various provisions that affect federal spending in three ways: some policies increase costs; some policies reduce spending; and others generate additional revenues.

For the 2012-2021 period, the budget office has projected that there will be more new revenue than new spending, resulting in a net decrease in federal deficits of $210 billion, according to a February 2011 estimate. As of March of this year, that estimate had not been updated.

So, the senator is clearly wrong to cite projected savings of ""$250 million over the first 10 years.""

But Menendez made a larger mistake by suggesting the budget office has projected ""$1.2 trillion in savings"" over the second 10 years.

The budget office has not projected any specific dollar figures for that period. The uncertainties are too substantial to create such detailed projections, according to the budget office.

The ""$1.2 trillion"" cited by Menendez is based on the budget office’s estimate that health care reform policies would reduce deficits in that second decade by ""an amount in a broad range around one-half percent of gross domestic product (GDP)."" GDP is a measure of the nation's economy.

However, in multiple reports over the last few years, the budget office has cautioned that this long-term estimate carries a ""greater degree of uncertainty."" That's why a specific dollar figure has not been projected.

In a December 2009 report, the budget office said: ""A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great.""

As the budget office noted in a February 2011 report, calculations for the second decade are based on the assumption that existing provisions remain unchanged, but a number of policies may not be sustainable over a long period of time.

""Over a longer time span, a wide range of changes could occur—in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care—that are very difficult to predict but that could have a significant effect on federal health care spending,"" according to that report.

So, Menendez’s ""$1.2 trillion in savings"" is not based on an exact dollar figure projected by the budget office, but instead on a percentage of GDP, a rough estimate with a ""greater degree of uncertainty"" attached to it.

In response to our findings, Menendez spokeswoman Tricia Enright said in an e-mail:

""CBO was asked by members of Congress to provide the out-year estimates for the health care law and that’s what they did. They said their best estimate was .5% of GDP. If you take that estimate and plug in the numbers so that it’s actually easier to understand, you get approximately $1 trillion. That’s the estimate the Senator has used and it’s the same estimate used by the President’s economic team. It’s the estimate he will continue to use.""

Our ruling

In a TV interview, Menendez claimed that, as a result of the national health care reform, ""the Congressional Budget Office says we save $250 million over the first 10 years. Over the next 10 years, we save $1.2 trillion in savings in terms of health care.""

The senator’s claims contain an element of truth, which is that the budget office has projected health care reform policies will likely lower federal deficits. But Menendez fumbled by citing those specific figures.

Over the first 10 years, the budget office is projecting a reduction of $210 billion, not the ""$250 million"" cited by Menendez.

As for whether there will be ""$1.2 trillion in savings"" in the second 10 years, the budget office has not projected any specific dollar figure for that period. Instead, Menendez’s claim is based on a percentage of GDP that's considered by the budget office to be a rough estimate with a ""greater degree of uncertainty.""

Gingrey claim about Obama health care old, inaccurate
","
Opponents of President Barack Obama’s signature health care legislation are rushing to turn his recent victory before the U.S. Supreme Court into a defeat at the ballot box this November.

The court ruled June 28 that the law’s requirement that certain people buy health insurance is constitutional under federal taxing powers.

The decision gave Republicans a chance to repeat a claim that the bill is a tax of historic proportions.  

U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey of Marietta joined the chorus the day the court released its decision to uphold the mandate during an interview on American Public Media’s radio show ""Marketplace."" It airs on WABE-FM, Atlanta’s local National Public Radio station.

Gingrey said he wouldn’t care to have a beer with Supreme Court Justice John Roberts.

""I'd like to pour one on his head,"" Gingrey quipped. He also complained that the bill is a whopper of a tax.

""This indeed is the largest tax [increase] in the history of our country,"" Gingrey said.  

Politicians and pundits have been using different versions of this talking point for years, and we’ve often ruled it False or worse.

The latest such statement PolitiFact rated came from conservative talk show host Rush Limbaugh, who earned a Pants on Fire for saying ""Obamacare is ... the largest tax increase in the history of the world.""

It’s not even the largest in American history, PolitiFact ruled.

PolitiFact Georgia contacted Gingrey’s office for answers.

Before we evaluate his response, let’s review the reasoning behind our prior rulings.

Hold tight. It’s complicated.

The federal Joint Committee on Taxation, a nonpartisan committee of Congress with a professional staff of economists, attorneys and accountants, broke down the tax impact of the health care law from 2010 to 2019.
       
Over the next 10 years, the plan would raise hundreds of billions of dollars through measures such as a Medicare payroll tax increase, new taxes on certain medical devices and so-called ""Cadillac"" health care plans, and an annual fee on health insurance providers.   

The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates the health care law will bring in more than $437.8 billion by 2019. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated the additional revenue coming in to the government to be $525 billion between now and 2019.

Is this the biggest tax increase in American history?

We turned to a method employed by Jerry Tempalski, an analyst in the Office of Tax Analysis with the U.S. Department of the Treasury. In 2006, Tempalski tried to determine the relative impact of major tax revenue bills from 1940 to 2006.

Tempalski used revenue estimates from Treasury and the Joint Committee on Taxation. He measured the impact of the increase by calculating the increase in revenue as a percentage of the U.S.’ gross domestic product. He typically used estimates from immediately after the laws went into effect.

Calculations for 1940-1967 should be viewed with some caution, he said, because revenue estimates are from different sources and are not completely consistent.
       
Here are Tempalski’s top five tax increases from 1940 to 2006:
       
        1. Revenue Act of 1942: 5.04 percent of GDP
       
        2. Revenue Act of 1961: 2.2 percent of GDP
       
        3. Current Tax Payment Act of 1943: 1.13 percent of GDP
       
        4. Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968: 1.09 percent of GDP
       
        5. Excess Profits Tax of 1950: 0.97 percent of GDP
       
       
The 2010 health care law wasn’t included in the list, so we calculated our own percent of GDP figure.

We chose 2019 as our base line. That’s when the bill’s tax provisions go into full effect.

The CBO estimates that in 2019, the government will see increased revenue of $104 billion, including the penalty paid by people who decline to buy health insurance.

We divided that number into the CBO’s gross domestic product projection for 2019, which is $21.164 trillion.

The result: 0.49 percent of total GDP. The health care bill doesn’t even crack Tempalski’s top five.

Gingrey spokeswoman Jen Talaber countered that the CBO’s 2010 long-term budget outlook says Obama’s health care law will increase revenue to 1.2 percent of GDP by 2035. That would catapult the tax to near the top of the list.

But that projection is for more than two decades from now. The accuracy of revenue and GDP projections plummet the further into the future they go.

Second, Gingrey’s number is not comparable to those in Tempalski’s ranking. Tempalski’s calculation compares revenue estimates for years immediately after the new tax law goes into effect, not a generation out.

In addition, Gingrey cherry-picks favorable statistics while ignoring the most up-to-date information. The CBO’s 2012 projections show Obama’s health care bill will increase tax revenue by far less -- 0.8 percent.

Make no mistake about it -- this is still a huge tax increase. And there are a lot of unknowns as the program is implemented.

But Gingrey went further than that. He said it is the ""largest tax"" increase in the nation’s history.

PolitiFact ruled previously that Obama’s health care bill is not the largest tax increase in U.S. history. That ruling stands.

Ohio Democratic Party says Kasich budget forced local cuts, tax increases, layoffs
","
After a recent appearance on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" in which Gov. John Kasich said he had balanced Ohio's budget and cut taxes, the Ohio Democratic Party issued a statement that his budget had negative consequences for local communities.

""Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone,"" the statement said, ""causing many communities to seek school levies, local tax increases, layoffs"" to offset budget cuts.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to check out the claim.

The governor's office answered with its own statement. It said the number of local government workers in Ohio has increased under Kasich after decreasing under his Democratic predecessor, Ted Strickland, and that the number of local tax issues has declined.

PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued. Kasich and other Republicans often talk about shrinking the size of government. We found he was accurate, three months ago, when he said the number of state workers in Ohio had gone down.

So it was something like a ""man bites dog"" story for him to boast that local government employment increased on his watch after declining under a Democratic administration.

Kasich's spokesman referred us to the employment database of the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

It showed that the number of local government workers in Ohio in July 2011, when the Kasich budget went into effect, was 520,600. It was 526,200 in preliminary numbers for May, the most recent number available -- an increase of 5,600 workers.

The number stood at 554,700 in July 2007, when the first Strickland budget went into effect, and 523,400 in June 2011 -- a decrease of 31,300.

The decrease continued until last January, when it reached 520,000, the lowest level since 1999. The peak of local government employment in Ohio was 560,600, reached in July 2004, according to the BLS.

Kasich spokesman Rob Nichols also pointed to the local election tallies on the Ohio secretary of state website. The figures show ""tax issues were at the lowest levels since 2003,"" he said, countering the claim that Kasich's budget led to local tax increases.

We looked, though we find it difficult to draw any conclusions about local finances from a simple count of the number of tax issues on local ballots. For consistency of comparison, we looked at November general-election tallies. (There has been one November general election and one spring primary since Kasich's budget went into effect.)

What we found was a general consistency in the number of tax issues: a total of 1,009 last November; 1,059 in November 2010; 1,100 in November 2009; 1,053 in November 2008, and 995 in 2007 -- the lowest level in the years for which a local issues summary was available.

Kasich's two-year budget, signed a year ago, cut state funding for local governments by about $630 million over the two years, and cut funding for schools by about $700 million. The governor challenged local governments to be more efficient and creative to deal with the cuts without raising taxes.

Ohio Democratic Party Spokesman Jerid Kurtz cited 10 municipalities and school districts looking at layoffs and tax hikes that officials blamed on the funding cuts.

One was the city of Lima. Its finance director said it had a balanced budget as recently as 2008, but faced a $2 million deficit in its general fund, largely because of state budget cuts, despite ""reducing the general fund consistently for the past 10 years,"" the Lima News reported.

Another was Sycamore Township, near Cincinnati. It laid off most of its firefighters in May 2012 because, township officials said, state budget cuts would eliminate half of the community's general fund revenue.

A third was the Berea school district, which passed a 3.9-mill operating levy in March 2012 after reducing its budget by $5.1 million for reasons that included the loss of state dollars.

According to the Ohio School Boards Association, school levies passed in March 2012 at an ""exceptionally high"" rate of 74 percent, the highest level since November 2000. The usual passage rate for school levies in Ohio is about 54 percent, the group said.

The growth in local government employment ""is more likely due to the Ohio recovery that began a full year before Kasich took office,"" Kurtz said. ""There is absolutely no proof Kasich's budget is the cause.""

Seeking further perspective, we called the Ohio Municipal League, which lobbies for cities and villages. Communications director Kent Scarrett said he ""certainly"" agreed ""there is more of an uptick in school levies"" because of state funding cuts, and said the full impact has not yet been felt.

The biggest cuts in direct payments to municipalities through the Local Government Fund will come in year two of Kasich's budget in 2013. The elimination of the estate tax in 2013, which is also part of the budget, will further reduce revenue to local governments.

""They're going to be up against it next year,"" Scarrett said. ""In 2013 the cuts are going to be much more profound. It's kind of scary.""

That's looking into the future, which we won't do.

Let's get back to the statement we're checking: ""Kasich slashed local government and school funding to the bone,"" causing many communities to seek tax increases and lay off workers.

The claim is partially accurate.

Kasich's budget did cut funding for local governments significantly. Some school districts and municipalities have sought, considered or passed tax issues to deal with budget shortfalls to which the funding cuts have contributed. And the Ohio Democrats can provide anecdotal evidence that some budget shortfalls have threatened or led to layoffs.

But the claim also overlooks important details that give the it context.

The number of local government jobs in Ohio has actually increased since Kasich's budget was enacted, after dipping to a 12-year low. And the number of local tax issues to appear on ballots across Ohio has been steady for several years.

Further, one of the outside experts we talked to says it is too soon to tell the full impact of cuts in funding because the biggest cuts through the Local Government Fund haven’t kicked in yet, nor has the elimination of the estate tax.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True. ",/factchecks/2012/jul/11/ohio-democratic-party/ohio-democratic-party-says-kasich-budget-forced-lo/

There’s no proof that white vans, external locks are being used for sex trafficking
","Since late 2019, social media users have been sharing posts urging people to call 911 at the sight of a white van with external locks on its doors and hatches. ""If you see any vans like this call 911,"" says a Nov. 22 Facebook post, which shows an image of a white van with external locks on its side door and hatch. ""This is utilized for sex trafficking."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Human trafficking is a legitimate threat that affects millions of people. But while it’s possible that some human traffickers have used white vans to kidnap their victims, there’s generally no way to predict what type of vehicle a trafficker or other criminal would drive. More to the point, there’s no evidence that white vans with external locks are an especially common getaway ride for kidnappers. Like a pair of similar hoaxes we debunked related to zip ties and sex trafficking, this post seems alarmist.   A screenshot of a viral Facebook post warning that white vans with external locks are used by sex traffickers.​ When we searched news archives, we didn’t find a swarm of reports about human traffickers who used external locks to trap people inside their white vans and drive away.  Instead, we found a number of reports — from fact-checkers as well as local and national news outlets — that debunked viral Facebook posts that were fooling people into believing most white vans belonged to sex traffickers. Some outlets, like Lead Stories, knocked down posts claiming white vans with external locks are the vehicle of choice for sex traffickers, noting that such locks are widely available for sale online and commonly used by workers who use expensive tools on the job. Others dealt with similar posts that warned about white vans more generally. These posts reportedly took off after Baltimore Mayor Jack Young issued a warning about white vans that he claimed, without evidence, were ""trying to snatch up young girls for human trafficking.""  Young said he got word of such incidents from Facebook rather than from the Baltimore Police Department, which later told reporters it had no reports of actual incidents that involved sex traffickers driving white vans with external locks. A number of white-van owners have reported being harassed since posts associating their vehicles with sex trafficking have cropped up, according to Business Insider. The FBI declined to comment when we asked if incidents involving white vans were frequent or if white vans with external locks presented any particular reason for concern. But Robert Lowery, vice president of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, told Yahoo News that ""of the 420,000 missing children last year, there were around 30 or 40 physical abductions that involved, for example, grabbing them in public."" ""Although that’s too many and it does happen, these scenarios are rare,"" he said. In a statement to PolitiFact, the Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking, said it hasn’t identified white vans with external locks as a trend. Human trafficking often occurs between people that know each other, rather than complete strangers, and people being trafficked aren’t always physically restrained, locked away or held against their will, the group said. ""By far the most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it always — or often — involves kidnapping or otherwise physically forcing someone into a situation,"" the Polaris Project said in its statement. ""In reality, most human traffickers use psychological means such as tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims."" Shared Hope International, a nonprofit Christian organization with a similar mission, told us that ""trafficking victims are generally not kidnapped or taken away from their families abruptly."" ""Many people don’t realize sex trafficking exists in their community, but it impacts people everywhere,"" the organization said. ""Those who are concerned about sex trafficking and want to prevent people from being exploited should start by educating themselves and getting the facts."" It’s important to stay aware of your surroundings, and should you want to report or seek services related to a case of human trafficking, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or email [email protected].

Lee statue, supporters of Trump are sharing a familiar image created after Lemonis’ August 2017 interview on CNBC with #boycottCampingWorld.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

""There’s no doubt that there is probably not many consumers in this country today that are in favor of what has been said in the last couple days and if they are, quite frankly, don’t shop at my business,"" he said. ""And I think that the reality of it is that there is a fear, a fear of retribution."" The CNBC headline was born: ""Marcus Lemonis: If you’re OK with what Trump said, don’t shop at my business"" Reading his comments in context, Lemonis was not telling all Trump supporters not to shop at his store. He was talking about consumers who agreed with what ""has been said in the last couple of days,"" with a focus on Trump’s comments. A few days later, Lemonis made a live video to defend himself from the blowback, though he made a revision to what he actually said. ""What I said is that if you were okay with what happened at Charlottesville, with what was said and what was done, I am not OK with it,"" he said. He added he would not change his position no matter how much it hurt him.

Obama’s Energy Department didn’t give $737 million to company employing Nancy Pelosi’s brother
","Facebook users are sharing a year-old YouTube video that revived an old conspiracy alleging corruption between former President Barack Obama and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. ""Nancy Pelosi’s brother’s company received $737 million from Obama’s Energy Dept.,"" says the title of the video, which was posted to YouTube on Feb. 16, 2019. This claim exaggerates what really happened. Pelosi’s brother-in-law, Ronald Pelosi, was on the board of a firm that made a small investment in a solar company, and that solar company received a $737 million loan guarantee for a project.  Pelosi’s company never received $737 million from Obama’s Energy Department. The YouTube video splices together photos of Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Ronald Pelosi. It includes more than six minutes of narration lifted word-for-word from an opinion article on Illicit Info, a blog site for conversative and libertarian opinion writers. The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Daily Politics Feed, the YouTube channel responsible for the video, says all of its videos are created by transcribing the text of stories from ""alternative news sources."" The Illicit Info article is labeled as opinion. In a statement to PolitiFact, a spokesperson for Nancy Pelosi’s office said the claims about Ronald Pelosi have ""been repeatedly debunked."" ""It was a loan guarantee to a company with a very small investment from a firm Ronald Pelosi joined after the deal in which he had no financial stake or benefit,"" the spokesperson said, noting that Ronald Pelosi is Nancy Pelosi’s brother-in-law, not brother, as the video says. Several fact-checkers and news outlets have set the record straight since the deal was announced in 2011, including FactCheck.org, Snopes, the San Francisco Chronicle and Fortune. Some debunked similar claims again in 2019. Each of them found that Ronald Pelosi’s connection to SolarReserve, the parent company of the firm that received the loan for a project in Nevada, was blown out of proportion. According to those reports, the unsubstantiated claims first popped up shortly after the Energy Department announced in September 2011 that it would be providing a $737 loan guarantee to Tonopah Solar Energy, a subsidiary of SolarReserve, for a major solar project. At the time of the announcement, Ronald Pelosi was an ""independent director"" on the board of PCG Asset Management, a subsidiary of a private equity firm called Pacific Corporate Group, which had invested in SolarReserve, according to FactCheck.org. Before that, Pelosi had been an executive director with the same subsidiary firm from March 2008 to April 2009. That’s about the extent of Ronald Pelosi’s connection to the money in question. The $737 million sent to Tonopah Solar Energy was a loan guarantee, not a blank check, and SolarReserve told FactCheck.org and Snopes that Pacific Corporate Group’s investment was a 2% share. Pelosi also provided FactCheck.org with documentation showing that he took in just $25,000 annually from his role on the board.  Plus, Ronald Pelosi wasn’t on the board at the time that Pacific Corporate Group made its investment in SolarReserve, according to the San Francisco Chronicle. The Chronicle reported that Pelosi didn’t stand to profit from the firm’s stake in SolarReserve, either. Pacific Corporate Group did not return our emailed requests for comment. A YouTube video said, ""Nancy Pelosi’s brother’s company received $737 million from Obama’s Energy Dept."" The Energy Department didn’t give money to Ronald Pelosi or his company, Pacific Corporate Group.

Social media posts issue alarmist warning about zip ties, sex trafficking
","Social media users are warning women to be careful if they discover zip ties looped around the door handles of their cars and the cars parked nearby.

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Human trafficking is a legitimate threat that affects millions of people. But the method isn’t as widespread as the social media posts make it out to be.  The posts are similar to another alarmist hoax we debunked related to zip ties and sex trafficking.  A screenshot of a viral Facebook post warning women about a zip-tie contraption allegedly used by sex traffickers to distract women. We searched news archives for reports of sex traffickers using zip ties and found no record of the contraption described in the social media posts being used to distract women at their cars. We read about these posts in multiple reports from news outlets in Canada. According to those reports, the image started making the rounds in January, with posters claiming an incident occurred at a mall in the city of Burnaby. A separate post circulating at the same time said sex traffickers were also placing $100 on car doors as a different form of distraction.  Burnaby police said on Twitter that they were aware of the posts and that they were ""unable to find any report or investigation that fits this criminal activity."" They said the information in the posts was causing ""unnecessary concern"" to city residents. The FBI declined to comment when asked if incidents involving the zip-tie contraption had cropped up in the United States.  The Polaris Project, a nonprofit organization that works to combat human trafficking, said they haven’t identified the method as a trend.  Human trafficking often occurs between people that know each other, rather than complete strangers, and it doesn’t always involve a form of physical restraint, the group said. ""By far the most pervasive myth about human trafficking is that it always — or often — involves kidnapping or otherwise physically forcing someone into a situation,"" the Polaris Project said. ""In reality, most human traffickers use psychological means such as tricking, defrauding, manipulating or threatening victims."" Shared Hope International, a nonprofit, Christian organization with a similar mission, told us that ""trafficking victims are generally not kidnapped or taken away from their families abruptly."" The bottom line: It’s important to stay aware of your surroundings, and should you want to report or seek services related to a case of human trafficking, you can contact the National Human Trafficking Hotline at 1-888-373-7888 or email [email protected].

Checking tweet about Chinese people detained with flu-like symptoms
","Health officials across the country are bracing for the likely spread of the new coronavirus in the United States, which federal officials have said is inevitable. The new virus was first reported in China, which remains the epicenter of the outbreak. The virus has spread to at least 57 other countries. U.S. Customs and Border Protection has procedures in place when it comes to apprehending individuals attempting to cross the border illegally who may be infected with a communicable disease — regardless of their country of origin. In a Feb. 26 tweet starting with ""BREAKING,"" Charlie Kirk, a conservative pundit who founded Turning Point USA, said three people from China were apprehended after attempting to cross the U.S.-Mexico border and were quarantined after displaying flu-like symptoms. Kirk asked people to retweet his post, which included a call for heightened border security in the face of the new virus. ""Three Chinese nationals were apprehended trying to cross our Southern border illegally,"" he wrote. ""Each had flu-like symptoms. Border patrol quickly quarantined them and assessed any threat of Coronavirus. Our weak border is a health risk. Close the border—Build. The. Wall. RT!"" Kirk’s tweet gets some things right, but is missing a key detail: All three of the people apprehended by border patrol were medically cleared and returned to the custody of immigration officials. Kirk’s spokesman Andrew Kolvet pointed to a Fox News segment about the apprehensions, which featured an interview with Brandon Judd, president of the National Border Patrol Council. In the clip, Judd says that three Chinese citizens were apprehended in Del Rio and had flu-like symptoms. ""Our agents acted like champs, they quarantined them immediately and transferred them to a local hospital,"" Judd said. ""Luckily, they did not have the coronavirus."" Details from Border Patrol A Customs and Border Patrol spokesman said agents apprehend approximately five Chinese nationals a day within the agency’s Rio Grande Valley Sector on the Texas-Mexico border, a number that represents ""an extremely small percentage of our overall daily apprehension totals."" ""Although we haven’t encountered any issues to date, we do have measures in place to identify individuals with signs of illness who may be potentially infected with a communicable disease,"" he said in a statement from the agency. ""Individuals identified with symptoms of illness are referred to (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention) or local health officials for additional health screening."" The agency put this protocol into action on Feb. 10, when agents apprehended three Chinese nationals near Eagle Pass, after they crossed the Rio Grande along the Texas-Mexico border, according to a description of the event provided by the spokesman. The individuals were taken to the Eagle Pass Station, where officials determined that two of the three people had a fever, according to a Border Patrol official. At that point, all three individuals were taken immediately to a local hospital for assessment, before being taken inside the station. All three people were medically cleared for travel and turned over to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Since the individuals were taken directly to the hospital after a health assessment, they were not placed in quarantine at the Border Patrol station or taken to a designated quarantine station. Our ruling Kirk said: ""Three Chinese nationals were apprehended trying to cross our Southern border illegally. Each had flu-like symptoms. Border Patrol quickly quarantined them and assessed any threat of Coronavirus."" On Feb. 10, three people from China were apprehended at the border and two had a fever. All three were taken to a local hospital for assessment and were medically cleared for travel. None of the individuals were quarantined at the station. Kirk’s tweet gets some things right, but includes inaccurate details, like the number of people with symptoms and whether individuals were quarantined.

Post wrongly links Bloomberg spending for Toomey to Kavanaugh confirmation
","Mike Bloomberg’s past spending to help some Republican candidates has drawn the ire of Democrats, now that he’s seeking to be their presidential nominee. But a Facebook post goes too far in linking his spending to help re-elect U.S. Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., to the confirmation of U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh. In 2016, Toomey won a second term when he beat Democrat Katie McGinty, a former aide to Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf and former environmental adviser to President Bill Clinton, by about 1.5 percentage points.  ""Fact: Mike Bloomberg spent $12 million to re-elect a Senate Republican (Toomey) in 2016,"" stated the Facebook post. ""Toomey beat the Dem (McGinty) by 1.5 points. If McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won and could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court."" We found that Bloomberg did spend millions to help Toomey; whether that changed the outcome of the election is anybody’s guess. But the post exaggerates when it says the race had the power to change the Supreme Court. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Two ads by Bloomberg’s Independence USA PAC praised Toomey for crossing party lines to support background checks for gun buyers.  Toomey backed legislation to expand checks to online sales and gun shows — a position shared by Bloomberg, who helped launch the gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety.  A New York Times analysis of Bloomberg’s donations stated that he spent $11.7 million to support Toomey in 2016. Since 2012, the New York Times found, Bloomberg has helped candidates from both major parties, but his political committees have given more to Democrats than Republicans.  We used the database of donations posted by the Center for Responsive Politics and found that Bloomberg’s Independence USA PAC spent $5.9 million in support of Toomey in 2016. As an individual, Bloomberg gave $2,700 to Toomey’s campaign.  The Pennsylvania U.S. Senate race was the most expensive general-election Senate contest in the nation in 2016, reaching a total of $170 million with candidate and outside spending combined. The Facebook post misleads when it states, ""if McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won.""  At the beginning of 115th Congress in January 2017, there were 52 Republicans, 46 Democrats and 2 independents who caucused with the Democrats. When Alabama Democrat Doug Jones took office in January 2018, that gave Republicans a 51-49 lead. If McGinty had won, the Senate would have ended up at 50-50. So who would have been in control? Washington University political scientist Steve Smith said that there are Senate precedents that allow the vice president’s party — in this case Mike Pence — to be treated as the majority party. When the 2000 elections produced a 50-50 tie and a Republican vice president, the two parties worked out a ""power-sharing agreement"" that provided for committees to be equally divided between the parties but with Republican chairs, Smith said. However the majority leader was the Republican leader. If the Senate found itself in another 50-50 split, that would lead to another round of negotiations. ""The Democrats would not control the Senate in the case of a 50-50 division,"" he said. ""To the contrary, some power sharing arrangement would again be negotiated and the term ‘control,’ an informal term, really would not fit. If the vice president was Republican, the majority leader would be Republican."" Now that brings us to the part of the Facebook post that said after Jones won, if McGinty had also won, the Democrats ""could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court."" This statement does have a qualifier of ""could,"" but if it assumes that a McGinty win alone could have changed the outcome. That’s misleading. The Senate voted 50-48 to confirm Kavanaugh in October 2018. U.S. Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia was the lone Democrat to vote in favor. If we take the hypothetical scenario of McGinty beating Toomey, and assume she would have followed Democratic Party lines, and all other senators would have voted in the same way as they actually did, the vote would have tied 49-49. That means that Pence could have cast a deciding vote. Other scenarios are equally hypothetical.  A Facebook post said, ""Fact: Mike Bloomberg spent $12 million to re-elect a Senate Republican (Toomey) in 2016. Toomey beat a Dem (McGinty) by 1.5 points. If McGinty had won, Ds would have controlled the Senate after Doug Jones won and could have blocked Kavanaugh from the Supreme Court."" Bloomberg did support Toomey and gave him significant funding. The rest of the claim is murky and relies on a hypothetical situation. Kavanaugh was confirmed in a 50-48 vote. If McGinty had won and all other things were the same, it likely would have ended up in a tie vote to be broken by Pence.

Josh Hawley exaggerates State Department warning in claim about Confucius Institute
","U.S. Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., applauded the University of Missouri following its announcement that the university’s Confucius Institute will shut down in August. ""Pleased Mizzou is shutting down the#China Communist Party funded ‘Confucius Institute.’ As the State Department warned Mizzou in July 2019, and as I have repeatedly stated, this program presented security risks for students & university as a whole,"" Hawley tweeted Jan. 15. Hawley has criticized the Confucius Institute and raised questions about the program in the past, including when he sent a letter to MU Chancellor Alexander Cartwright on July 24 urging him to ""reconsider the costs and risks that come with allowing a Confucius Institute to remain on (Mizzou’s) campus, and with entering any other agreements with the Chinese government."" That wasn’t the first time a politician urged a university to shut down its Confucius Institute program citing threats to security; Texas A&M closed its program after two U.S. representatives wrote a letter recommending the action to four Texas universities. We decided to look into whether the State Department really warned Mizzou in July about security risks arising from a Confucius Institute program. We found a letter, but struggled to find a warning. The controversy Mizzou’s Confucius Institute is one of about 500 established worldwide by Hanban, a subsidiary of the Chinese Ministry of Education. Hanban’s website describes Confucius Institutes as nonprofit, public institutions that ""aim to promote Chinese language and culture in foreign countries.""  Hawley criticized Hanban in his letter to Cartwright, saying that it is governed by leaders of 12 Chinese ministries, including those that handle media and propaganda. He also said universities that partner with Hanban sign contracts that prohibit ""tarnishing the reputation"" of Hanban, and they send teachers and textbooks designed to promote a positive image of China. In the United States and across the globe, universities have been shutting down their programs amid concerns and investigations. BBC News reported in September 2019 that a ""flurry"" of universities worldwide had closed their programs in the preceding weeks.  Mizzou announced on Jan. 14 that its contract with the Confucius Institute will be terminated, effective in August, according to a news release from the university. The main reason: a change in State Department guidelines that now requires a certified Mandarin teacher to accompany classrooms with Confucius Institute staff members. The Confucius Institute instructors were classified as interns on exchange visas, not teachers. The university said it would cost too much to make the changes in categories. The release says the State Department notified Mizzou in a July letter. Hawley’s press secretary confirmed with us this is the same letter he was referring to in his tweet. So, did the State Department warn Mizzou that the Confucius Institute presented security risks? MU spokesperson Christian Basi provided us the July 15 letter from the Department of State’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs. It was signed by Henry C. Scott, director of the Office of Private Sector Exchange Program Administration. There’s no direct warning given by the State Department here. The letter was meant to notify Mizzou of violations in its Confucius Institute program that were found by the department and address how to fix them. The letter states the exchange program administration attempts to help sponsors of a Confucius Institute program correct errors when the office notices them. It addressed specific areas of concern.  The first area of concern was Confucius Institute student interns teaching in K-12 classrooms without a supervisor who speaks Mandarin. The language barrier ""creates a vulnerability, as efficacy of the co-teacher’s supervision is severely limited,"" the letter states. If that is a warning about security, it’s pretty opaque.  The other areas of concern listed were failures to comply with required form signatures and worker’s compensation policies, improperly listing Confucius Institute student interns’ primary site of activity and misusing a ""Research Scholar"" role defined by the department.  There is no specific mention of potential risks to students or Mizzou in the letter.  Our ruling Hawley said the State Department warned Mizzou that the Confucius Institute ""presented security risks for students & university as a whole."" In a July letter to the university, the State Department listed violations of its guidelines and offered instructions on how to fix those violations. The letter never warns the university about risks created by the Confucius Institute; there’s little language that points to any warning. The closest it comes is in pointing out the risks of not adhering to the department guidelines on having a Mandaring speaker in the classroom, which ""creates a vulnerability.""
