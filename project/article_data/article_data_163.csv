Viral image about Democratic senators and 'big pharma' is misleading
","A viral post circulating recently in some of the more liberal corners of social media accuses 13 Democratic senators of allegedly voting against lower drug prices because they were recipients of big money from drugmakers. The post included the names and photographs of 13 Democratic senators — Cory Booker and Bob Menendez of New Jersey, Michael Bennet of Colorado, Tom Carper and Chris Coons of Delaware, Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Martin Heinrich of New Mexico, Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Patty Murray and Maria Cantwell of Washington state, Jon Tester of Montana, Mark Warner of Virginia, and Bob Casey Jr. of Pennsylvania. It also listed dollar amounts the senators were said to have received from ""big pharma."" Several readers asked us to check the post’s accuracy, so we did. (We’ll set aside the misspelling of Booker’s first name.) The viral image was created by a group called The Other 98, which says it fights ""economic injustice, undue corporate influence and threats to democracy."" We were unable to reach a representative of the group. However, we were able to make pretty solid guesses about the underlying reference. It lines up with the voting results for an amendment voted on by the Senate on Jan. 11, 2017. The amendment is filled with legislative jargon, but it would basically create a mechanism to promote ""lower prescription drug prices for Americans by importing drugs from Canada."" The measure failed, with 46 votes in favor and 52 against. The 13 Democratic senators targeted in the post were among those 52 votes against. As for the dollar figures, they largely align with donations listed on the OpenSecrets.org site run by the Center for Responsive Politics, an independent clearinghouse for campaign finance data. In every case, the dollar amounts listed track almost exactly the amounts given to each senator under the category ""pharmaceuticals/health products"" for the 2016 campaign cycle, notwithstanding a few small deviances. The post, however, includes some errors, and its accuracy is undercut by a significant oversimplification: The image gives no indication that the senators also voted for a separate amendment that explicitly sought to lower drug prices. The vote wouldn’t actually implement ‘cheaper medicines’ There are a couple of issues with considering action against the measure to import drugs from Canada as a vote ""against cheaper medicines."" The vote was more symbolic than substantive. It was an amendment to a Senate budget resolution, which is a non-binding measure that doesn’t get signed by the president or become law. Rather, they set a framework for committee chairs to work within when deciding how to spend money. So the measures shouldn’t be oversold as direct action. ""Simply put, if adopted by the Senate, the amendment would not have required the United States to begin importing drugs from Canada -- period, full stop,"" said Jeff Giertz, communications director for Booker. ""It would have added language into the budget resolution that would have advised the Senate to spend money in a way that would result in this."" ""Giertz said that Booker supported the same goals, but wanted to see a framework for ensuring the safety of imported drugs included in the amendment."" Don’t overlook another vote to amend the same bill It’s important to know that every one of the 13 senators listed in the meme voted in favor of a separate amendment that did urge lower drug prices. This other amendment effectively prevented the Senate from considering legislation that did not ""as promised by (President-elect Donald Trump), lower drug prices, as certified by the Congressional Budget Office."" Like the other amendment, this did not pass -- it won only 47 votes in favor, with 51 against. But the fact that all 13 senators listed on the meme voted to support this amendment muddies the conclusion of the meme that they all ""voted against cheaper medicines."" The senators offered varied reasons for opposing the amendment the viral image refers to. For instance: • Booker: ""I support the importation of prescription drugs as a key part of a strategy to help control the skyrocketing cost of medications. Any plan to allow the importation of prescription medications should also include consumer protections that ensure foreign drugs meet American safety standards. I opposed an amendment put forward last night that didn’t meet this test."" • Coons: The amendment ""didn’t meet the safety standards he believes are necessary,"" a spokesman Sean Coit told PolitiFact. • Donnelly: ""I do not believe the best way to address the problem of rising prescription drug prices or to advance an importation policy is through legislation that is designed specifically to take health care away from the people who need it"" -- that is, the Republican-backed effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act. • Casey: ""Sen. Casey had concerns about whether existing safety standards would apply to wholesalers,"" spokesman John Rizzo told PolitiFact. ""Sen. Casey has spoken with (Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., an amendment sponsor) about this, and the two of them are actively working on legislation that will allow importation."" The numbers shown don’t only represent money from 'big pharma' The assertion that these senators took millions from ""big pharma since 2011"" is also imprecise. We’ll start with what looks like a typo. The dollar amounts shown are generally accurate for the 2016 campaign cycle, but if you were to include the totals going all the way back to 2011, as the meme states, then the amount would be substantially larger than what is shown. Because the point would have been stronger with larger dollar figures, this looks to us like an unintended mistake. However, the ""pharmaceuticals/health products"" category as defined by the Center for Responsive Politics is actually broader than what most reasonable people would consider ""big pharma."" For this purpose, a more accurate subcategory for ""big pharma"" would be the Center for Responsive Politics category ""pharmaceutical manufacturing."" Several of the senators listed on the post rank in the group’s top 20 recipients of ""pharmaceutical manufacturing money"" during recent election cycles, but not all of them do -- and the amounts for each are smaller than what the meme reflects. Murray made the top 20 list in 2014 and 2016, for a cumulative $265,406. (You can investigate the numbers at the Center for Responsive Politics site here.) Coons made it in 2012 and 2014 for a cumulative $138,450. Casey made the list in 2012 and 2016, for a combined $231,380. Carper made the list in 2012 and 2016, for a combined $171,300. Menendez and Tester made the top 20 in 2012 ($153,800 and $54,750, respectively), Booker and Warner made it in 2014 ($233,750 and $71,050), and Bennet made it in 2016 ($135,127). These dollar amounts, which are admittedly incomplete, are lower than what the post shows for each senator’s ""big pharma"" contributions. Then there’s another caveat we always mention in articles like this one. The industry donation breakdowns tallied by the Center for Responsive Politics doesn’t just include donations by fat-cat executives and company political action committees. It also includes donations made by any individual employed by a company in a given industry sector. This can include rank-and-file employees -- and in states with a heavy pharmaceutical presence in the workforce, this can be a significant factor. These states include Delaware, represented by Carper and Coons, and New Jersey, represented by Booker and Menendez. Our ruling The viral image says that 13 Democratic senators ""voted against cheaper medicines"" and took millions from ""big pharma since 2011."" The 13 Democrats did vote against one amendment that was intended to lower drug prices through reimportation of medicines from Canada, and they have each taken money from drugmakers. However, the image leaves a misleading impression that the senators have voted against lowering drug prices. In reality, all 13 senators voted in favor of a different amendment that specifically advocated ""lower drug prices."" In addition, the dollar amounts listed for the senators use an overly broad definition of ""big pharma,"" inflating the amount of money they have taken from the industry. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False. EDITOR'S NOTE: We have modified our paraphrase of a comment by Giertz to better reflect what he said.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C495080>],/factchecks/2017/jan/18/other-98/viral-image-about-democratic-senators-and-big-phar/

Education nominee Betsy DeVos says a Wyoming school might need guns to stop grizzly bears
","President-elect Donald Trump’s pick for education secretary thinks some K-12 schools may decide they need a gun on campus — to protect themselves from bear attacks, for example. At her Senate confirmation hearing, education activist and major Republican donor Betsy DeVos mentioned a meeting she had with Sen. Mike Enzi, R-Wyo. He told her about a rural public school in Wapiti, Wyo., that has a fence surrounding the schoolyard to keep grizzly bears out. Later in the hearing, DeVos suggested a fence might not be enough. When Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., asked DeVos if she thinks guns should be allowed on school premises, DeVos said that decision should be left up to local lawmakers who might have specific needs. Like grizzly bears.  ""I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies,"" she said, referencing the school in Wyoming. We couldn’t bear not knowing whether the elementary school in Wapiti, Wyo., keeps a gun on hand to defend against grizzlies. So we called up Park County School District No. 6, which includes Wapiti Elementary School. ""No, we do not,"" said Angie Page, assistant to the superintendent, citing the district’s no-weapons policy. The entire state of Wyoming actually has a policy banning weapons on elementary, middle and high school campuses, state Department of Education spokesperson Kari Eakins said. Decisions about wildlife defensive measures are made at the local level and not reported to the state. Even though Wapiti Elementary doesn’t keep a gun for use against a grizzly, there really is a fence to keep bears out.   Wapiti, an unincorporated community with a population of about 165, is located on the edge of Yellowstone National Park. More than 700 grizzlies live in the Greater Yellowstone area, according to the National Park Service. The Wapiti school put up a fence to keep the grizzlies out of the playground in 2002, according to the Billings Gazette, a newspaper in Montana. Between 1990 and 2000, 16 grizzly bears were captured within a 4-mile radius of Wapiti, the article said. The Denver Post reported in 2005 that a Wyoming Fish and Game biologist had recently captured two cubs hanging around the Wapiti school, and that a grizzly hide was nailed outside of the principal’s office. Even after finding that DeVos’ claim was incorrect, we wondered if it’s advisable to use a gun when faced with a potential grizzly bear attack. Adult males can weigh up to 700 pounds and are about 3.5 feet tall at the shoulder.   ""Without question, guns can protect people from bears,"" said Tom Smith, a wildlife sciences professor at Brigham Young University. ""But, and this is a big but, to be able to use a firearm under duress effectively is limited to a very small group of persons."" Smith told us that people would be much better off using some sort of bear spray (about $40 on Amazon). It’s non-lethal to the bear, it’s less cumbersome than a gun, and because it creates a plume of spray, the user’s aim doesn’t have to be as accurate as it would be if he or she were using a gun. A study of bear attacks in Alaska found that in 27 percent of cases involving guns that failed, the person couldn’t get their gun ready fast enough to shoot the bear, according to an article Smith wrote for Alaska Magazine in 2012. Firing a warning shot was only successful at getting the bear to leave in 33 percent of incidents. ""So while some may carry firearms for protection, and it certainly is their right, the vast majority of persons would do themselves — and bears and quite honestly the rest of us — a big favor by carrying bear spray,"" Smith said. Our ruling DeVos said, ""I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school (in Wapiti, Wyo.) to protect from potential grizzlies."" The elementary school in Wapiti certainly faces the threat of grizzly bears, given its proximity to Yellowstone National Park. It has a fence surrounding the playground to keep bears out. However, the state of Wyoming and the school district ban weapons in K-12 schools, so Wapiti Elementary does not have a gun on hand to defend against potential bear attacks. We rate DeVos’ claim False. Correction: Due to a transcription error, the word ""probably"" was left out of DeVos' statement in an earlier version of this article. It read, ""I would imagine there's a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies."" The article has been updated with her complete quote: ""I would imagine that there's probably a gun in the school to protect from potential grizzlies."" Additionally, we have corrected a statistic about the efficacy of firearms against bears. The rating of False remains the same.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BBD880>],/factchecks/2017/jan/18/betsy-devos/education-nominee-betsy-devos-says-wyoming-school-/

After Fort Lauderdale airport shooting, legislator says Florida lags behind in mental health funding
","The suspect in the mass shooting at the Fort Lauderdale/Hollywood International Airport told the FBI in Alaska in November that he was hearing voices. Anchorage police confiscated Esteban Santiago’s handgun and took him for a mental health evaluation. Police returned his gun to him in December when he asked for it. On Jan. 6, he flew to Broward County and is the suspected gunman in a rampage at the airport that left five dead and several others injured. Days later, Democratic state legislators held a press conference in Tallahassee to argue for gun control measures and more mental health funding. Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith, D-Orlando, said that Republican legislators argue that the way to reduce gun violence is not through gun control but mental health care funding. But Florida, he said, has the worst record in the nation in terms of funding mental health care treatment. ""We see once again Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding — 50th,"" he said. ""There is no one that is doing worse than we are when it comes to making sure we that we are providing comprehensive mental health care."" Florida is near the bottom of the pack in mental health funding, and one key ranking cited by many experts places the state at 51st in per capita spending. However, there are some caveats about the ranking. Comparing state mental health funding Smith pointed to news articles about Florida’s low ranking on mental health funding and data from the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. Mental health funding experts said they consider the institute’s data as the best source. The institute collects annual data on expenditures by state mental health agencies from the states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico. The total amount of expenditures is divided by the state population to compare the amount per capita. The most recent data, for fiscal year 2014, showed Florida ranked 51st out of 52 jurisdictions for total state mental health spending — behind 49 states and Washington, D.C. — at $36.05 per capita. The Sunshine State was only ahead of one jurisdiction: Puerto Rico, at $20.22. Florida has consistently been near the bottom of the rankings for years, said Ted Lutterman, senior director of the institute. In general, states in the northeast and northwest spend more, while southern states spend much less, he said. One key caveat about this data: It is based on money spent through Florida’s Substance Abuse and Mental Health Office, managed by the Department of Children and Families, and it doesn’t include services paid from other sources, including Medicaid or local funds, on mental health programs. ""Those additional funding sources aren’t reported to DCF, but they’re still used within the local systems of care to treat individuals,"" said Jessica Sims, DCF spokeswoman. The national research institute asks the state mental health authority in each state to provide information on all the funds used for its public mental health provider system, including state psychiatric hospitals and community providers. If another state agency uses Medicaid funds to pay for services directly and doesn’t work with the state mental health authority, then the state mental health authority will not have that data, Lutterman said. In most states, the state mental health authority helps manage the Medicaid funds. However Florida administers Medicaid differently, Lutterman said, and therefore isn’t able to report the Medicaid data for this report. The National Alliance on Mental Illness uses the per-capita state expenditures to compare rankings, said the alliance’s spokesman Bob Carolla. ""It reflects the relative degree of commitment to mental health by the state,"" he said. ""Medicaid dollars compared to Medicaid dollars could be a separate indicator, except I believe it’s more problematic because of the differences that exist between the state Medicaid programs."" Florida lags behind the majority of states on Medicaid spending per enrollee and the state Legislature rejected Medicaid expansion as part of the Affordable Care Act. Another way to examine mental health funding is to look at whether states are increasing the amount each year. The National Alliance on Mental Illness annual survey of state mental health care legislation doesn’t rank states but shows general budgeting trends. The 2015 report shows Florida maintained funding in 2013 and increased it in 2014 and 2015. Our ruling Smith said, ""Florida is ranked 50th in the nation for mental health care funding."" A key source of data for ranking states on mental health spending is the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors Research Institute. That data shows that Florida ranked 51st in 2014. However, it is difficult to compare Florida with other states because it administers its Medicaid program differently than most states.

"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan wrongly claims actuaries have determined Obamacare is in a 'death spiral'
","As Republicans in Washington move toward a repeal of Obamacare, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan is doubling down on criticism of the sweeping healthcare law. That included a description in his Jan. 12, 2017, weekly briefing about the current state of Obamacare. ""The law is in what the actuaries tell us (is) a death spiral,"" the Wisconsin Republican said. ""So we’ve got to intervene to prevent this from getting worse."" Ryan used the same ominous term — death spiral — in his Jan. 5, 2017, weekly briefing and as far back as a Fox News interview in December 2016. But is it accurate? Death spiral has a precise meaning The phrase ""death spiral"" evokes an airplane in a nosedive, but in the world of health care it carries a specific definition. Ryan appears to be referring to that definition since each time he used the term, he attributed it to actuaries. So this isn’t a fact check on the health or success of Obamacare, but on whether the present condition is consistent with what industry number-crunchers call a ""death spiral."" The term refers to a cycle where shrinking enrollment leads to a deteriorating risk pool (that is, healthy people leave the plan due to the cost). That leads to higher premiums, which causes enrollment to shrink even further, continuing the cycle. ""It’s a well-known and documented phenomenon,"" said David Cutler, a Harvard University economics professor who was among the early users of the term in a 1998 paper, though he doesn’t believe he was the first. Three elements to a death spiral So a death spiral requires 1.) shrinking enrollment, 2.) a deteriorating risk pool and 3.) rising premiums. Let’s look at those one by one. The latest figures show enrollment in the Affordable Care Act’s insurance exchange is up slightly from last year. Through Dec. 24, 2016, some 11.5 million people were signed up for coverage, an increase of 300,000 from the same point last year. ""This market is not merely stable, it’s actually currently on track to grow,"" said Aviva Aron-Dine, an economist with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. ""These (death spiral claims) are claims that have been sort of demonstrably false for a while, but it’s even more irresponsible to be repeating them now when we actually have enrollment data for 2017."" As for the risk pool, Aron-Dine said it improved in 2015. Data for 2016 isn’t available yet, but the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reports the share of people signing up for 2017 in the low-risk demographic — ages 18-34 — is on par with 2016, at 26% of enrollees. Larry Levitt, vice president of the health care-focused, nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, noted the 26% number in a Jan. 10, 2017, tweet, adding, ""You'd expect that number to go down in an insurance ‘death spiral.’"" And data maintained by Standard & Poor’s shows the pool of people insured through the marketplace is improving, as the insurer cost per enrollee dropped below costs in the employer-sponsored market for the first time since Obamacare began, said Ben Wanaker, deputy assistant secretary with HHS. The role of premiums is more nuanced. Premiums are going up significantly this year. The benchmark plan used to gauge changes increased an average of 24% across the 50 states and Washington, D.C., the Kaiser Family Foundation reported. But most consumers won’t see any increase in what they pay because Obamacare includes subsidies that cap premium prices at a certain percentage of income for anyone below 400% of the federal poverty level (in 2016 that would be $47,520 for a single person). Among the people who have signed up so far for 2017, 81% will receive a subsidy. As a result, for most there is no direct connection between premiums and enrollment — the core connection that defines a death spiral. For example, Arizona has by far the largest premium increase for 2017 (145%) but has still seen Obamacare enrollment increase by 8 percent so far. ""When the premiums go up, people don’t drop coverage because the amount they pay hasn’t changed,"" Cutler said. When asked for evidence of the death spiral, Ryan spokesman Ian Martorana provided links to other people who have claimed the system is in a death spiral and details on how premiums are rising and insurers are leaving the marketplace. But he did not provide any data that showed the conditions being met for the actuarial definition of a death spiral. None of this is to say things are rosy for Obamacare. Several of the country’s largest insurers have abandoned or drastically scaled back their involvement in the exchanges, meaning one-third of counties will now have only one company offering plans on the exchange. But that’s not a death spiral. Mark Pauly, a conservative health economist at The Wharton School, said it was a ""poor choice of words"" by Ryan. ""It’s not a death spiral, it’s just a downward spiral,"" he said. Our rating A death spiral is a health industry term for a cycle with three components — shrinking enrollment, healthy people leaving the system and rising premiums. The latest data shows enrollment is increasing slightly and younger (typically healthier) people are signing up at the same rate as last year. And while premiums are increasing, that isn’t affecting the cost to most consumers due to built-in subsidies. So none of the three criteria are met, much less all three. We rate Ryan’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A410F00>],/factchecks/2017/jan/18/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-wrongly-claims-actuaries-have-determined/
"['Illinois', 'Mike Fortner']","
Fortner's claim about states with automatic voter registration checks out
","Sponsors of a new bill to make voter registration automatic with issuance of Illinois driver’s licenses say it fulfills federal standards for proving voter eligibility and protects against fraud. Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoed the state's first attempt at automatic voter registration (AVR) over questions about fraud and federal compliance. But the chief co-sponsor of the new legislation, state Rep. Mike Fortner, R-West Chicago, wrote in an op-ed that his bill ""requires the applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, as is required by the National Voter Registration Act and used by all other states that have (automatic voter registration)."" With automatic voter registration gaining momentum in recent years, we decided to look into Fortner’s claim to see whether states that have authorized AVR do in fact require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote. Automatic voter registration in the U.S.  Illinois’ attempt to institute automatic voter registration failed after Rauner vetoed Senate Bill 250 over concerns it could violate federal election law and open the door to voter fraud. Rauner said he supports modernizing the state’s election system and easing voter access, and noted in his veto message that with a few changes, he could get behind a future version of the bill.   That new version was introduced Nov. 15 by House Republican leader Jim Durkin in the form of House Bill 6627. Later that month, Fortner penned an op-ed explaining how the GOP-backed legislation addresses the issues raised by the governor. Six states -- Alaska, California, Connecticut, Oregon, Vermont and West Virginia -- and the District of Columbia have enacted AVR as of Dec. 8, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In March 2015, Oregon became the first state in the nation to pass a law that allows for the automatic registration of eligible residents applying for or renewing a driver’s license, except those who opt out. Most recently, voters in Alaska approved a November ballot measure to allow AVR through the state’s Permanent Fund Dividend (PFD), which pays a sum to eligible residents who have lived in Alaska for a full calendar year. Once the system is in place, eligible voters, unless they decline, either would be registered automatically or have their existing voter information updated when they complete their annual PFD applications. A total of 29 states considered measures in 2016 to automatically register residents who conduct business with state government agencies and transmit voter information electronically to election officials, according to the New York University School of Law’s Brennan Center for Justice. In addition to Illinois, New Jersey was the only other state whose legislature passed an automatic voter registration bill that ended up being vetoed by the governor. Requirements of automatic voter registration  Fortner writes in his op-ed that unlike SB 250, the legislation he’s sponsoring requires an applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, which he says is required by the National Voter Registration Act of 1993, also referred to as the ""Motor Voter Act."" The language in Fortner’s bill states that a driver’ license/voter registration application must, ""unless the applicant declines to register to vote or change his or her registered residence address, require the applicant to attest, by signature under penalty of  perjury, to meeting the qualifications to register to vote in Illinois at his or her residence address as indicated on his or her driver's license or identification card application."" Federal law mandates states include a voter registration form as part of any application for obtaining or renewing a driver’s  license. These applications only can require the minimum amount of information necessary to allow state officials to determine the eligibility of an applicant. According to the U.S. Department of Justice, a ""voter registration application must state each voter eligibility requirement (including citizenship), contain an attestation that the applicant meets each requirement, state the penalties provided by law for submission of a false voter registration application and require the signature of the applicant under penalty of perjury."" Under SB 250, the Secretary of State’s Driver Services Department would have been permitted to send all information pertaining to an applicant’s identity, address and citizenship to the Illinois State Board of Elections, ""regardless of whether or not the individual attested to his or her eligibility to register to vote."" That language was one of the sticking points for Republicans who opposed the bill, and was underscored in the governor’s veto message. ""Senate Bill 250 does not require an applicant to attest to meeting the qualifications to vote or to sign the application, as required by federal law,"" Rauner wrote in his veto message. ""The bill relies on the State Board of Elections to screen out individuals who are not eligible to vote, even though the State Board may not have access to that information."" Do all states with AVR require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote? The second part of Fortner’s statement claims all states with automatic voter registration require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote. In a phone interview, Fortner said his staff had verified that each state with automatic registration requires applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote. Jonathan Brater, counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice’s Democracy Program, referred to the attestation requirement as an ""in-the-weeds legal issue."" Brater said it’s difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison among states with automatic registration because eligibility requirements are collected differently in each state. He added that the attestation requirement outlined in the motor voter law is from a time when computers weren’t used for voter registration, and that the ""specific wording of the law doesn’t really reflect how states do it"" today. At least 33 states use electronic registration at DMVs and about 39 currently or soon will offer online voter registration. Both are available in Illinois. ""The real problem with the National Voter Registration Act so far is that not enough people are getting to register to vote,"" Brater said. ""Automatic voter registration fulfills the promise of the law that other attempts to implement have not."" While states with automatic voter registration do collect eligibility information differently, an analysis of legislation passed by state legislatures shows applicants must attest that they meet the qualifications to vote and/or sign the application form. Here’s a look at AVR requirements in those states:  Our ruling In a November op-ed about a Republican-backed automatic voter registration bill, Fortner wrote, ""House Bill 6627 also requires the applicant to attest to their eligibility to vote, as is required by the National Voter Registration Act and used by all other states that have AVR."" Fortner argued the House Republican’s automatic voter registration legislation addresses the concerns raised by Rauner when he vetoed SB 250 on Aug. 12. The bill would have permitted the Secretary of State to electronically send information pertaining to an applicant’s identity, address and citizenship to the State Board of Elections, ""regardless of whether or not the individual attested to his or her eligibility to register to vote,"" according to the language of the bill. The West Chicago Republican’s claim that the National Voter Registration Act requires applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote, as do all the states that have automatic voter registration is accurate. An analysis of the legislation passed by the six states and Washington, D.C., that have enacted AVR shows all of them require applicants to attest to their eligibility to vote with a signature, and none had language similar to that of Illinois’ bill. We rate Fortner’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3FA600>],/factchecks/2017/jan/17/mike-fortner/fortners-claim-about-automatic-voter-registration-/

No, 70% of foreign aid is not 'stolen off the top'
","The United States spends about $50 billion on foreign aid, or about 1 percent of the entire federal budget. Much of it, whether in the form of development, health, humanitarian or military aid, involves the State Department at some point in the process. So at a confirmation hearing for Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., asked Tillerson about corruption in foreign aid. ""There are many, many, many reports talking about corruption within foreign aid,"" Paul said. ""That we give it to developing countries, and 70 percent of it's stolen off the top."" Tillerson answered that he had once seen military forces steal shipments of food aid right at the airport. He said that sort of thing could be avoided if America picked the right partners to deliver aid. In this fact-check, we decided to take a closer look at Paul’s 70 percent figure. Across the board There is no question that the aid bucket can leak. Sergio Gor, Paul’s spokesman, told us Paul ""was pointing out how often foreign aid is stolen."" But neither Paul’s office nor any expert we reached could point to any study that found that 70 percent of what we give winds up stolen. Gor sent us an article by noted aid researcher William Easterly at New York University that argued something altogether different. Easterly wrote that as of 2008, 76 percent of all American aid went to countries judged by the private consulting group PRS to be most corrupt. Does that mean all that money was lost? No. The corruption ranking is an indirect measure at best. It aims to help businesses figure out the risk of investing in a country and puts the most weight on patronage, nepotism and ""suspiciously close ties between politics and business."" Easterly himself told us that his analysis is ""suggestive"" but in no way conclusive that 70 percent of aid money is stolen. ""It is inherently impossible to calculate the number ‘x percent of aid is stolen’ from the numbers that I use on how much aid goes to corrupt countries,"" Easterly said. ""The actual stealing of aid happens mostly in secret, using many tricks intended to deceive any outside observers. So nobody knows how much is actually stolen."" Easterly wrote recently that in the name of fighting terrorism, the United States has ""redirected aid money to some of the most autocratic, corrupt, and oppressive regimes in the world"" such as Uzbekistan, Ethiopia and Uganda. He argued that this increased the risk of money going astray, but again, he said he couldn’t quantify the diversion. Morten Broberg, a law professor at Copenhagen University, focuses on corruption in development assistance and humanitarian aid. ""I do not recall coming across any detailed and convincing statistics,"" Broberg told us. Broberg called the 70 percent figure incorrect. Worst case examples Gor, Paul’s spokesman, told us ""there have been entire projects which have been fraudulently executed."" He pointed to an op-ed about Nigeria that claimed, without any documentation, that hundreds of billions of dollars had been stolen from the government since 1960, an amount nearly equal to the foreign aid donors had sent. He also cited an Economist article that said that a year after Western governments had given the African nation of Malawi $1.2 billion, ""corrupt officials, businessmen and politicians pinched at least $30 million from the Malawian treasury."" If true, that would be a lot of money, but it would amount to about 2.5 percent of the total aid -- not 70 percent. Providing aid in war zones is particularly susceptible to fraud. Government auditors for the U.S. Agency for International Development investigated 25 cases of fraud and corruption within the humanitarian aid effort in Syria. In one case, a Turkish vendor had replaced lentils with salt in food ration kits for Syrians running from the fighting. Out of $835 million spent, they said their investigations ""resulted in more than $11.5 million in savings."" They also said at one point, as much as $300 million worth of program work was on hold, pending review. That does not mean fraud or theft had taken all that money. About a quarter of those funds were later allowed to move forward. Afghanistan and Iraq are major sinkholes of American aid. A 2014 Special Inspector General report on Afghanistan reconstruction said about $1.6 billion in aid was flowing through ministries that ""were unable to manage and account for funds."" The report did not estimate how much aid was stolen. The report said that even when U.S. Agency for International Development staff knew that controls were weak, they continued to approve grants. For Iraq, the congressional Commission on Wartime Contracting estimated that the cost of fraud ""ran between 5 and 9 percent"" between 2002 and 2011. That amounted to as much as $18.5 billion over that period. Our ruling Paul said that 70 percent of foreign aid is ""stolen off the top."" Paul’s office was unable to point to a study that backed that up for all American aid, and experts who study the issue knew of no such estimate. While theft is real, and possibly extreme on individual projects, it is not on the scale Paul asserted. We rate this claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c2956347-4ba9-4b1b-a0a9-2794c2448aa9",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B914C0>],/factchecks/2017/jan/17/rand-paul/no-70-foreign-aid-not-stolen-top/

John Lewis wrong on whether he skipped an inauguration before Donald Trump's
","The back-and-forth between President-elect Donald Trump and civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga., dominated news coverage over the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend. It began on Jan. 14 with an excerpt from an interview that Lewis did for NBC’s Meet the Press, in which he said that while he believes in forgiveness, ""it's going to be very difficult"" to forge a relationship with Trump. ""I don't see this president-elect as a legitimate president."" Trump quickly took to Twitter to criticize Lewis. In a pair of tweets, Trump said, ""Congressman John Lewis should spend more time on fixing and helping his district, which is in horrible shape and falling apart (not to.....mention crime infested) rather than falsely complaining about the election results. All talk, talk, talk - no action or results. Sad!"" Trump’s comments drew criticism for ignoring Lewis’s sacrifices in the 1960s civil rights movement and for mischaracterizing Lewis’ district. PolitiFact rated Trump’s assertions about the district Mostly False. Lewis, for his part, also drew criticism (including from Democrats) for his characterization of Trump as someone who isn’t ""a legitimate president."" Lewis’ stance is not universal among Democrats. While the 40-plus Democrats who are skipping the inauguration is an unusually large number, they amount to a minority of the Democratic caucus in the House. In his Meet the Press interview, Lewis underlined the importance of his concerns about Trump by saying, ""It will be the first (inauguration) that I miss since I've been in Congress. You cannot be at home with something that you feel that is wrong, is not right."" Some readers asked us whether this was true. It turns out that it is not. Lewis didn’t attend President George W. Bush’s inauguration in 2001. Bush prevailed after a weeks-long, controversy-laden recount that ended with a 5-4 Supreme Court decision. A contemporary Washington Post article included this paragraph: ""Some members of the Black Caucus decided to boycott Inauguration Day; John Lewis, for instance, spent the day in his Atlanta district. He thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in because he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president."" Lewis’ office confirmed the accuracy of the Post’s 2001 account. ""Rep. Lewis also missed one other inauguration, the first inauguration of President George W. Bush,"" said the statement from Lewis’ communications director, Brenda Jones. ""His absence at that time was also a form of dissent. He did not believe the outcome of that election, including the controversies around the results in Florida and the unprecedented intervention of the U.S. Supreme Court, reflected a free, fair and open democratic process."" Indeed, on Jan. 17 -- three days after Lewis’ original comment and three days before his inauguration -- Trump jumped on the discrepancy in another pair of tweets. ""John Lewis said about my inauguration, ‘It will be the first one that I've missed.’ WRONG (or lie)! He boycotted Bush 43 also because he… thought it would be hypocritical to attend Bush's swearing-in....he doesn't believe Bush is the true elected president. Sound familiar! WP"" (The ""WP"" apparently refers to the Post story.) So Trump’s tweet is accurate, and Lewis’ original statement on Meet the Press was not. Our ruling Lewis said that Trump’s inauguration ""will be the first one that I miss since I've been in Congress."" That’s incorrect: Lewis also boycotted the first inauguration of George W. Bush, a decision confirmed both by contemporary news reports and Lewis’ own office. He made this comment to demonstrate the intensity of his opposition to Trump, but it's a fact that he also boycotted Bush's inauguration.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Homeland Security', 'Luke Messer']","
Rep. Luke Messer is correct, 2006 act allows the construction of a border wall
","With Donald Trump days away from taking the presidential oath, Republicans have been examining ways to help him meet his campaign promise of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Critics have called out the proposed wall as a tremendous expense. But Rep. Luke Messer, R-Ind., has said the Secure Fence Act of 2006 already supports construction of the border wall. ""By funding the authorization that's already happened a decade ago, we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump's campaign pledge to secure the border,"" Messer said in a CNN story published Jan. 6. We wondered if the 2006 law gives Trump the green light to get started on his immigration promise. Experts told us Messer’s claim is on point. A 2006 law The Secure Fence Act of 2006 was signed into law by Republican President George W. Bush. The act allowed the Department of Homeland Security to ""take all actions the secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States."" Those actions include the use of personnel, technology and physical infrastructure enhancements, the law says. That authorization of physical infrastructure enhancements could include a fence, wall, barrier, et cetera, said Molly Gillaspie, a spokeswoman for Messer. The 2006 law defined ""operational control"" as the prevention of all unlawful entries into the country, ""including entries by terrorists, other unlawful aliens, instruments of terrorism, narcotics, and other contraband."" It also directed the department to build two-layered fencing along five stretches of the border, amounting to about 850 miles, according to a 2009 Congressional Research Service report. That double layer requirement was revised by the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008, the report said. The modification directed the Homeland Security secretary to construct reinforced fencing ""along not less than 700 miles of the southwest border where fencing would be most practical and effective and provide for the installation of additional physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors to gain operational control of the southwest border."" Currently, there are 702 miles of fencing along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection. That includes 652 miles of primary fencing, 36 miles of double-layered fencing and 14 miles of tertiary fencing, according to the agency. In a post-election interview Nov. 13, Trump told CBS's Lesley Stahl he would accept fencing ""for certain areas … but certain areas, a wall is more appropriate."" In a press conference Jan. 11, Trump told reporters, ""It’s not a fence. It’s a wall. You just misreported it. We’re going to build a wall."" The Secure Fence Act of 2006 gives the Department of Homeland Security some discretion on how they choose to secure the border and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2008 gave the department greater flexibility, said Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center, a nonpartisan think tank researching global issues. ""It is our belief that U.S. Customs and Border Protection can build additional barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border — whether you call these ‘walls,’ fences or other sorts of barriers — in the regular course of its work and without requiring additional authorization from Congress,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications and public affairs at the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank studying migration policies and trends. A limitation for the construction of the southwest border wall would rise from Congress’ willingness to pay for it, not from needed authorization, said Edward Alden, an expert on border security and a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank. The REAL ID Act of 2005, passed by Congress, even gave the Homeland Security secretary the authority to ""waive all legal requirements"" that may get in the way of constructing border barriers, Alden noted. That authority was used in 2008 by then Secretary of Homeland Security Michael Chertoff to waive environmental reviews. Our ruling Messer said, ""By funding the authorization that’s already happened a decade ago (in the Secure Fence Act of 2006), we could start the process of meeting Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to secure the border."" The 2006 law authorized the Department of Homeland Security to ""take all actions the Secretary determines necessary and appropriate to achieve and maintain operational control over the entire international land and maritime borders of the United States."" Those actions include the use of personnel, technology and physical infrastructure enhancements. Experts told us that what’s now needed from Congress to build a wall are funds, not additional permission.

Sam Johnson airs Half True claim that Social Security is 'going bankrupt by 2034'
","A Texas congressman forecasted disaster within two decades unless Congress adopts a fix to the Social Security program. U.S. Rep. Sam Johnson, R-Plano, declared in a Dec. 10, 2016, online post: ""Social Security is in trouble (it’s going bankrupt by 2034)."" Johnson, a former Texas House member and POW who also has announced plans not to seek re-election in 2018, included with his Facebook post a web link to a Forbes magazine news article about his freshly-introduced plan for Social Security reform. That plan, he wrote in his post, would prevent benefits from being ""immediately cut"" by 20 percent when the Social Security fund runs dry.  Johnson’s 54-page proposal would change how benefits are calculated, lowering benefits for high-income workers and increasing them for low-income workers, and also raise the age at which workers could claim Social Security retirement benefits from the existing 66 to 69. Social Security in the federal budget Social Security, established by a 1935 law, adds up to the nation’s universal support program for retired, disabled or dependent Americans.  In 2015, too, it accounted for the largest single chunk of federal spending, racking up $882 billion in expenses that year, according to the Congressional Budget Office.                    SOURCE: Congressional Budget Office, ""The Federal Budget in 2015"" And it’s no secret that barring intervention, the program is headed for shrinkage. In May 2013, PolitiFact Ohio rated Half True a claim that ""the Social Security trust fund is sound,"" finding credible forecasts of the program’s fiscal fade; the CBO in 2012 said the fund would run dry by 2034 under current law. Millions of Americans also consider Social Security vital income. In 2015, PolitiFact Florida rated Mostly True a claim that one third of the country’s seniors were depending on Social Security for 90 percent of their income; both figures were actually greater. As of November 2016, some 66 million Americans received Social Security payments, which averaged $1,241.66 monthly, according to the Social Security Administration. About 41 million beneficiaries were older than age 65 and about 25 million of those individuals relied on the aid for half or more of their monthly incomes. So, was Johnson correct that the program will be bankrupt by 2034? Johnson cites trustees' report We emailed Johnson’s Washington office and got a reply from his press secretary, Adrienne Rimmer, who sent a 272-page report from the board of trustees of the Social Security program. The report, dated June 22, 2016, made projections for the future of Social Security, which is formally called the Old-Age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance program (OASDI) reflecting the combination of two insurance programs: old age and survivors insurance and then disability insurance. Rimmer pointed us to language in the report stating: ""Under the Trustees’ intermediate assumptions, projected OASDI costs will exceed total income by increasing amounts starting in 2020, and the dollar level of the combined trust fund reserves declines until reserves become depleted in 2034."" Depleted? That sounds like nearly emptied as in almost bankrupt. Still, the trustees predicted there would remain money sufficient to pay reduced benefits. The report states: ""At the time of depletion of these combined reserves, continuing income to the combined trust funds would be sufficient to pay 79 percent of scheduled benefits."" The cause for projected depletion of the funds, according to the report, is ""the retirement of the baby boom generation will increase the number of beneficiaries much faster than the number of covered workers increases."" To refresh: The baby boom generation was born in about the two decades following WWII, a period when the U.S. birth rate surged nearly 50 percent over pre-war levels, according to the U.S Centers for Disease Control. The birth rate then tapered from about 26.5 births per 1,000 Americans in 1948 to about 14 in 2009. That cohort born in the post-war decades began to retire, and thus began to draw retirement benefits, after 2010. As more baby boomers retire, they will switch from a source of income for social security to an expense. The U.S. Census Bureau reported in 2014 that the number of Americans age 65 and older would grow from 22 per every 100 working-age people in  2012 to 35 per every 100 working-age people in 2030. That’s why the trustees, in their report, predicted that total program costs will begin to exceed income in 2020, with all cash reserves expended by 2034. So we could see how Johnson reached his conclusion. Bankrupt or not? And does the trustees’ forecast break out to Social Security going bankrupt? We noticed, for starters, that the trustees’ analysis, slated for its next update in July 2017, indicates there’s a minimal possibility the fund doesn’t dry up until at least 2091. But otherwise the latest report presents three scenarios, of ""low,"" ""intermediate"" and ""high"" costs to the program, based on assumptions about birth and death rates, growth in wages, interest rates and the consumer price index. For the low-cost scenario, the report states, the board assumed a relatively high birth rate, a relatively high death rate and relatively high immigration--meaning many people entering the workforce and fewer retirees living long enough to collect substantial benefits. The low-cost scenario also assumes relatively high worker productivity and wage growth plus relatively high inflation and low unemployment--all of this adding up to workers drawing bigger paychecks and paying more into Social Security. The high-cost scenario, in contrast, assumes low birth and death rates and low immigration, all of this placing more stress on the fund.                SOURCE: Document, ""The 2016 annual report of the board of trustees of the federal old-age and survivors insurance and federal disability insurance trust funds,"" Board of Trustees, Federal Old-Age and Survivors Insurance and Federal Disability Insurance trust funds, June 22, 2016 Johnson’s conclusions were based on the intermediate scenario -- though the report said ""significant uncertainty surrounds the intermediate assumptions."" Then again, when the report authors ran 5,000 simulations with randomly assigned values to the key parameters, they found a 95 percent chance that the fund would dry up between 2029 and 2045, leaving benefits to be paid solely from incoming payroll tax receipts. News reports don't say 'bankrupt' Seeking non-governmental context, we looked up news articles from the time of the trustees’ report’s release. Up front, we noticed, none of the stories on the trustees' forecast includes the word ""bankrupt,"" The Wall Street Journal reported on June 22, 2016: ""Social Security, Medicare face insolvency over 20 years, trustees report."" The article said: ""Social Security faces depletion by 2034."" Around the same date, Time magazine reported that ""the combined trust funds that help pay old age and disability benefits are likely to run out by 2034,"" and The Washington Post wrote, ""the Social Security trust fund has enough cash to pay full benefits for another 18 years."" Outside experts concur it's not bankruptcy For more perspective, we queried several outside experts including Mike Brandl, a senior lecturer in economics at The Ohio State University. So, Social Security going bankrupt? ""It’s kind of a scare tactic to use that kind of terminology,"" Brandl said by phone. ""There is a legal definition of bankruptcy. When a firm or a person goes bankrupt, what happens generally is the creditors puts in a claim with the courts to recover their debt."" According to the website for U.S. federal courts,""bankruptcy helps people who can no longer pay their debts get a fresh start by liquidating assets to pay their debts or by creating a repayment plan."" A business can can either liquidate or reorganize in order to claim bankruptcy. In contrast, under the scenario outlined in the trustees’ report, the Social Security program wouldn’t liquidate assets or be reorganized after 2034; it would simply shrink what is pays in benefits. That is, Brandl told us, Social Security would ""become insolvent,"" meaning it wouldn’t be able to pay its debts in full. We ran Brandl's analysis past Josh Gordon, policy director of the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, which sponsors research and education about the federal budget. Gordon agreed by phone: ""Bankrupt is the wrong word to use. Bankruptcy implies it runs out of money, it doesn’t exist, it has to liquidate its assets, and nothing of the sort could happen to the Social Security program."" We also connected with Thomas Saving, a Social Security trustee from 2000 through 2007 and director of the Private Enterprise Research Center at Texas A&M University. Saving said by phone that regardless of bankruptcy’s definition, the trustees’ report made clear that Social Security will not be able to pay its bills in full after 2034 without a change in law. Savings added that in his view, a change in law was ""certain"" to be adopted by Congress because ""it’s impossible to imagine that you make all these promises and you’re going to renege on them."" Promises? Saving noted that working Americans pay into Social Security with the understanding that they will eventually draw benefits. So, Saving suggested, lawmakers couldn’t conceivably let the program die. Saving later emailed us a web link to a Social Security Administration web page listing nine categories of likely social security reforms intended to maintain solvency. They range from raising the cap on a federal cap on taxable income, to taxation of benefits and investments, raising the age at which a person automatically qualifies for retirement benefits, creating personal Social Security accounts or changing the rules by which children or spouses of workers receive benefits. Our ruling Johnson said the Social Security program ""is going bankrupt by 2034."" Johnson's cited government scenario indicates a mismatch between Social Security revenues and obligations will likely result in shortfalls and benefit cuts by 2034. But the relevant report also says the scenario's underlying assumptions come with ""significant uncertainty."" Regardless, it's clear that at some future date Social Security will have to rely solely on incoming payroll tax receipts to cover what would likely be reduced benefits. That’s trouble, as Johnson said. Yet it’s not bankruptcy, which suggests a terminal shutdown. We rate this claim Half True.

Tammy Baldwin: Federal government prohibited 'from negotiating lower prescription drug prices'
","In the heat of her historic run for the U.S. Senate in 2012, Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin traded charges with Republican rival Tommy Thompson over prescription drug prices for senior citizens who are on Medicare. After defeating the former governor to become the nation’s first openly gay U.S. senator, Baldwin largely scaled back her public statements. But in recent months, as a 2018 re-election campaign looms, she has returned to being more vocal. With potential GOP challengers lining up, Baldwin revisited the Medicare issue on Jan. 5, 2017, declaring on Twitter: ""We have a broken system in D.C. that prohibits the fed gov from negotiating lower Rx drug prices for our senior citizens. Let’s change it."" The tweet clearly alluded to Medicare, in that it was accompanied by a graphic that referred to legislation known as the Medicare Prescription Drug Price Negotiation Act. So, is a behemoth like the federal government not allowed to use its leverage to attempt to negotiate lower prescription drug prices in Medicare? And while we’re asking: What impact would such negotiation power have? Part D Medicare Part D is a voluntary insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare proposed by Republican President George W. Bush. It became law in 2003 and has been in place since 2006. Private insurance companies offer a variety of plans subsidized by the government, and beneficiaries get to choose the plan that's best for them. In 2016, nearly 41 million Medicare beneficiaries were enrolled in Part D. Democrats have complained that Part D was a huge giveaway for the pharmaceutical industry because, although the insurance plans can negotiate prices with drug makers, the government cannot. President Barack Obama vowed to change the program to allow Medicare to negotiate lower prices, but then backed away from the pledge during negotiations over his Affordable Care Act, earning a Promise Broken on PolitiFact National’s Obameter. Three 2016 presidential candidates -- Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders -- supported federal negotiation. And in January 2017, Baldwin and other Democratic senators introduced a bill to allow negotiation. So, the issue is back in play. During the Baldwin-Thompson race, we rated True a claim by Baldwin that federal law prohibits the government from negotiating for ""better prices"" in Medicare Part D. That law remains in place. So, what impact would federal negotiation have? Views vary. Lower prices? Fewer drugs? The current law says that ""in order to promote competition,"" the health and human services (HHS) secretary ""may not interfere with the negotiations between drug manufacturers and pharmacies and prescription drug plans."" Jack Hoadley, a public policy professor at Georgetown University, told us the federal government might have more leverage than individual insurance plans to negotiate lower prices, if it were allowed. A 2015 federal report found that Medicaid, for example, has negotiated larger rebates from drug manufacturers -- which reduce drug costs to the government and to senior citizens -- than the private plans in Medicare Part D ""by a substantial margin."" In contrast, American Enterprise Institute health care and retirement policy scholar Joseph Antos told us that if the government negotiated for lower prices in Part D, ""there will be an attempt to push up prices paid by everyone else."" Grace-Marie Turner, president of the pro-free market health reform Galen Institute, said federal negotiation would really mean ""price controls"" that might would discourage drug makers from investing in research that produces new drugs. The nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation summarizes it this way: Proponents believe that giving the secretary of HHS the authority to negotiate drug prices on behalf of millions of Medicare beneficiaries would provide the leverage needed to lower drug costs, particularly for high-priced drugs for which there is no competition and where private plans may be less able to negotiate lower prices. Opponents believe the secretary would not be able to get a better deal than private plans already do and that plans have greater leverage with drug companies because of their whole line of business, but, if the secretary were able to negotiate lower prices, pharmaceutical companies would reduce their investment in pharmaceutical research and development. Our rating Baldwin says the federal government is prohibited ""from negotiating lower prescription drug prices for our senior citizens."" Her reference is to Medicare Part D, a voluntary insurance program for prescription drugs for people on Medicare. Views differ on whether seniors ultimately would benefit if the federal government could negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies on prescription drug prices for Part D. But current federal law does prohibit that.

Trump's exaggerated claim that John Lewis' district is 'falling apart' and 'crime infested'
","President-elect Donald Trump kicked off Martin Luther King Jr. weekend by sparring with Democratic Georgia Rep. John Lewis, after the civil rights icon said he doesn’t see Trump as a ""legitimate president."" Lewis, in an interview with NBC, said he wouldn’t attend the presidential inauguration because he thought the Russians had helped Trump win election. A few hours later, Trump hit back on Twitter, saying the place Lewis represents is ""crime infested.""  As many have noted, Lewis has had a long record of action, including dozens of arrests dozens for protesting segregation, enduring violence at the hands of state troopers and leading the fight for racial justice in the 1960s.    But is Trump right that Lewis’ district today isn’t doing so hot? A transition team spokesman referred us to the district’s unemployment, poverty and crime rates. They are higher than the national and state averages, but the district is doing well . Calling it ""crime infested"" is a stretch. Georgia’s 5th congressional district, which Lewis has represented since 1987, consists of most of Atlanta (Fulton county) as well as parts of the surrounding suburbs (DeKalb and Clayton counties). Here’s a map:    To get a sense of how Georgia’s 5th is doing, we looked at the Census Bureau’s My Congressional District service, which compiles federal demographic and socioeconomic data.   Georgia’s 5th State average National average Unemployment rate (2015) 8.2 percent 5.5 percent 5.0 percent Median household income (2015) $48,017 $49.620 $53,889 Poverty rate (2015) 21.3 percent 17.0 percent 13.5 percent Percent with high school degree (2015) 87.6 percent 85.4 percent 86.7 percent Percent with bachelor's degree 40.6 percent 28.8 percent 29.8 percent   As you can see, the district has higher unemployment and poverty rates than the national and state averages and a lower median income. On the flip side, it also has a higher rate of education attainment. Atlanta, the heart of the district, is a major international transportation hub and one of the fastest growing places in the country. Forbes named the city the ninth best place in America for businesses and career development, and among the best for job growth and education. The Brookings Institution’s Metro Monitor report — which measures economic trends in 100 U.S. cities like job and wage growth, poverty and gross metropolitan product — placed Atlanta at No. 32 for growth (though it ranked at No. 62 and 63 for prosperity and inclusion, respectively) in its January 2016 report. A separate analysis by PNC Financial Services noted Atlanta’s ""tech and corporate cluster"" and its ""economic dynamism."" (A number of Atlanta companies, including Coca Cola and Delta Air Lines, made the Fortune 500 in 2016). Longer term, the financial analysts concluded, the city will be ""an above-average performer."" In sum, Trump is exaggerating when he says Georgia’s 5th is ""falling apart"" by some metrics and, by others, he’s flat-out wrong. What about his parenthetical swipe at the dangers of living in Lewis’ district? Crime is not reported by congressional district so we’ll have to look at the Georgia 5th’s constituent parts. As the Trump transition team accurately noted, Atlanta had the 14th-highest violent crime rate in 2015 with 1,120 violent crimes per 100,000 residents. That’s about triple the national average: 372.6 offenses per 100,000. (We should note the FBI cautions against ranking and comparing crime rates across cities.) But that ignores the fact that Atlanta’s violent crime rate, as well as property, has been decreasing over the past decade, mirroring the overall national trend. Here are two charts showing that: While Atlanta does make up most of the Georgia’s 5th, the district does contain parts of other towns with lower crime rates. For example, Brookhaven in the northern tip had a violent crime rate of 327.9 in 2015, and Morrow in the southern end 574.6, according to FBI statistics. Residents of Lewis’ district did not agree with Trump’s depiction of their neighborhood, and rallied to defend it on social media.  The Atlanta Journal Constitution highlighted the reactions on its front page Sunday morning, emblazoned with the headline: ""Atlanta to Trump: ‘Wrong.’ "" And in 2007, when Trump was looking to add his name the city’s skyline, he seemed to have a very different opinion of it, according to a 2015 Journal Constitution article. ""Atlanta is one of those cities that won’t be suffering the real estate foibles. Atlanta is like New York. New York is as hot as it ever has been,"" Trump said. ""It’s just going to get better."" (That year, the violent crime rate was 1623.8, about 45 percent higher than it was in 2015.) A day after his initial tweets, Trump broadened his claim and said Lewis should focus on ""crime-infested inner cities of the U.S.""  Our ruling Trump said Georgia’s 5th congressional district is ""in horrible shape and falling apart (not to mention crime infested)."" The district isn’t in as terrible economic shape as Trump suggests. While it has higher unemployment and poverty rates than the national average, it still has a thriving economic hub in Atlanta and higher educational attainment. Atlanta does have a much higher crime rate than the national average, but like most major cities, that has been in decline. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False. Correction: A previous version of this article compared the fifth district's poverty rate for families to the state's and country's poverty rates for all individuals.

Medicaid expansion drove health insurance coverage under health law, Rand Paul says
","President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and the key issue facing Republicans is how do they get rid of the sweeping health care law without creating chaos for an estimated 20 million people who gained insurance under the program. That includes many people who gained health care through more generous rules for Medicaid, a longstanding federal program for the very poor. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said dealing with people who got Medicaid is ""the big question."" ""The vast majority of people that got insurance under President Obama's Obamacare, the Affordable Care Act, got it through Medicaid,"" Paul said Jan. 15, 2017, on CNN’s State of the Union. Paul proposed that if any state wants to retain expanded Medicaid, it should be prepared to raise taxes to do so. Paul’s federal plan emphasizes reducing insurance regulations to lower prices and promoting health savings accounts. Our focus is on his statement that the vast majority of the newly insured under Obamacare came through the Medicaid program. We were curious if that was accurate. More people became eligible for health insurance through Medicaid after passage of the Affordable Care Act. The law expanded eligibility for the poor, though states could choose not to participate in the expansion. We reached out to Paul’s office for his source and did not hear back, but the U.S. Health and Human Services Department issued a report in March 2016 that at first glance gives some support to his claim. It said that Medicaid and CHIP (Children’s Health Insurance Program) added 14.5 million people by the end of 2015. (That’s the most recent data available.) Take that number at face value and about three-quarters of the newly insured came through the two closely linked programs. But the analysts we reached told us that a fair number of those new people were eligible for coverage under old rules that predated the Affordable Care Act. How many? The Kaiser Family Foundation broke it down into about 10.7 million newly eligible and about 3.4 million who were eligible before but hadn’t enrolled. Joan Alker, a research professor at Georgetown University’s McCourt School of Public Policy, told us that most of that 3.4 million are children. She said Medicaid analysts explain this through the ""welcome mat effect."" ""There was a lot of outreach and publicity, and people started coming in,"" Alker said. ""The parents might qualify for expanded Medicaid, but their kids were already eligible under Medicaid or CHIP.  And the same could happen for parents who signed up through the marketplace."" The marketplace was the way to sign up -- often through a government website -- for individual private insurance under the Affordable Care Act. It turns out, the impact of Obamacare on Medicaid is more complicated than simply more generous eligibility rules for adults. Benjamin Sommers at the Harvard School of Public Health said research he and his colleagues did showed that about half of the Medicaid increases came through eligibility changes and about a half through drawing in those who were eligible before. For Sommers, both effects are part of the Affordable Care Act. In that sense, he thinks Paul has a point. ""The majority of the national coverage gains are Medicaid, but not the vast majority,"" Sommers told us. In an op-ed, Sommers wrote that eligibility rules and the welcome mat effect are so intertwined, if parents lose their eligibility, very often coverage for their kids lapses as well, even though the children still qualify. ""If parents are disenrolled after an ACA repeal, many children will return to being uninsured,"" he wrote. A couple of other factors make it difficult to say precisely why Medicaid grew under Obamacare. Health care analyst, John Holahan at the Urban Institute, a Washington-based academic center, noted that the Medicaid enrollment data is shaky. ""If all 50 states send in their numbers, 40 of them might do a good job and for 10, the data might be garbage. You try to impute and make estimates to account for the flawed and missing information,"" he said. And Laura Wherry, assistant professor of medicine at the UCLA School of Medicine, said any model depends on some guesswork as to what would have happened if the Affordable Care Act hadn’t happened at all. Our ruling Paul said the vast majority of people that got insurance under Obamacare got it through Medicaid. About 20 million people gained coverage and about 14.5 million of those were under Medicaid or CHIP. But a sizeable fraction of that 14.5 million were eligible before the Affordable Care Act took effect. One estimate said about a quarter of them were previously eligible. Another estimate put it as high as half. There is some guess work behind all the reports. Medicaid might account for slightly more than half of those who gained coverage. Most people wouldn’t say that amounts to the vast majority, but it is likely still the majority. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097720580>],/factchecks/2017/jan/15/rand-paul/medicaid-expansion-drove-health-insurance-coverage/

Trump lawyer: Foreign dignitaries staying in a Trump hotel doesn't violate Constitution
","Here’s a hypothetical scenario giving some ethics watchdogs heartburn: A foreign dignitary visits Washington, D.C., on government business and decides to stay at the Trump International Hotel. He or she might choose to stay there because of its amenities, its convenient location four blocks from the White House, or to build up goodwill with the president who owns the hotel. If his hotel accepts the foreign government’s bill payment for the dignitary’s stay, some critics argue Donald Trump would, as president, be in violation of the Constitution’s provision to block foreign influence. The emoluments clause says that no officer of the United States can accept gifts, titles or emoluments (salary) from a foreign government, without permission from Congress. But lawyers for Trump say that the critics are mistaken, because this clause doesn’t apply to fair-value exchanges, such as paying standard market rates for a hotel room. ""These people are wrong,"" said Morgan Lewis & Bockius partner Sheri Dillon at a Jan. 11 press conference. ""This is not what the Constitution says. Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument."" Despite this position, Dillon said Trump’s company would donate to the U.S. Treasury any profits earned from foreign governments through his business, to avoid even the appearance of impropriety. And his company will also refrain from engaging in any new deals with foreign governments while Trump is president. But given the backlash about Dillon’s interpretation of the emoluments clause from some legal commentators, we decided to fact-check her claim that fair-value exchanges — like paying a hotel bill — are not emoluments. The answer we found isn’t very satisfying: Some legal scholars say Dillon has a point, others say she doesn’t. The emoluments clause hasn’t come before the courts in any meaningful way, so there aren’t any past judicial rulings to look at for guidance about the scope of the emoluments clause. Whether the clause even applies to the president remains an unsettled legal question. ""Anything anyone tells you about the emoluments clause is a matter of opinion,"" said Seth Barrett Tillman, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause. Before we go any further, here’s the full text of the emoluments clause, found in Article I, Section 9 of the Constitution: ""No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."" What that means is someone holding a government position cannot take an emolument, meaning payment or salary, from a foreign government. A clear example of an emolument would be if a government employee made a decision favorable to a foreign country and, in exchange, a representative of that country’s government gave the American employee a check. Dillon’s law firm explained in a Jan. 10 white paper why they believe this clause doesn’t ban, say, a foreign government paying a fair rate to stay in a hotel owned by a government worker. The authors of the Morgan, Lewis & Bockius white paper wrote that the Constitution’s authors understood the term ""emoluments"" to mean ""a payment or other benefit received as a consequence of discharging the duties of an office."" So paying a hotel to offer standard hotel services is not an emolument because the service provided is not associated with the office of a president. They also wrote that in the early 1800s, the country nearly amended the Constitution to extend the emoluments clause to all citizens, not just federal office holders. They did not see evidence that anyone thought that extending the clause’s reach would inhibit citizens’ ability to engage in fair commerce with foreign governments or their representatives. Tillman said he largely agrees with the Morgan, Lewis & Bockius white paper — especially because the money would be flowing into the Trump Organization, not Trump’s pockets directly. ""The concern is related to the concept of office,"" he said. ""It’s not about business deals like staying in hotels when the price is fixed."" That, however, is far from the final word. Several legal scholars wrote in a Brookings memo that they read the emoluments clause as applying to fair-value exchanges. The clause is intended to block any arrangement with a foreign state that could result in a profit or benefit for the officeholder because it carries the risk of ""improper foreign influence,"" as the officeholder’s legitimate business interests would depend, at least in part, on the foreign state, the authors wrote. They are Norman L. Eisen, chief White House ethics lawyer under Barack Obama, Richard Painter, chief White House ethics lawyer under George W. Bush, and Laurence Tribe, a law professor at Harvard University. The historical evidence shows, they argue, that the drafters of the Constitution wanted the emoluments clause to be broad in scope, in order to limit even the possibility of corruption. For example, the phrasing in the clause specifically refers to emoluments ""of any kind whatever."" ""Wholly apart from any actual quid pro quo arrangements or demonstrable bribes or payoffs, the emoluments clause will be violated whenever a foreign diplomat stays in a Trump hotel or hosts a reception in one,"" they wrote. Despite their position, Eisen, Painter and Tribe note that ""there is not yet a firm consensus on this point."" All of this discussion assumes that Trump, as president, would be subject to the emoluments clause. But that’s still not a certainty, and there is evidence, both modern and from the time of the Constitution’s ratification, that supports either side. We should note that hotel stays are not the only way representatives of foreign states interact with Trump’s business. He has worked with foreign governments to do business in around 20 countries. The Bank of China is a tenant in Trump Tower in Manhattan. Depending on how his plans to separate himself from his business play out, these dealings could present, if not a violation of the emoluments clause, a serious conflict of interest. Our ruling Dillon, a lawyer for Trump, said under the Constitution, ""Paying for a hotel room is not a gift or a present and it has nothing to do with an office. It's not an emolument."" Whether the emoluments clause would include a situation where representatives of a foreign state paid for a room in one of Trump’s hotels is an unanswered legal question. We encountered reasonable arguments on both sides, and there isn’t any judicial precedent to guide us to the right answer. Maybe this question will get answered in a meaningful way during the Trump administration. But for now, we rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0E0700>],/factchecks/2017/jan/13/sheri-dillon/trump-lawyer-foreign-dignitaries-staying-trump-hot/

Virginia Tea Party says dollar has lost 98 percent of value under The Fed
","
The Tea Party is no fan of the Fed.

In a pointed letter to Virginia's Congressional delegation, the Virginia Tea Party Patriot Federation recently called for an audit of the Federal Reserve System, blaming the bank for pushing the nation further into debt and devaluing the dollar.

The letter comes in response to Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke’s plan to buy $600 billion in additional U.S. Treasury bonds.

""The Fed, which was created and initially funded with taxpayer gold and monies by an Act of Congress, is opaque and operates in secrecy. It has done so since its inception in 1913,"" the letter reads. ""Since that time, the U.S. Dollar has lost 98% of its purchasing power. We believe that this alone is compelling reason enough to tear down the veil and audit the Fed. Chairman Bernanke's recent actions make the need for this audit all the more urgent.""

Upon hearing the 98 percent number we wondered two things:
1) Really?
2) And if so, is it all the Fed’s fault?  

Asked how they arrived at their conclusion, the letter’s co-authors said they used gold.

""In 1913 the official price of an ounce of gold was $20.64. Today, an ounce of gold buys $1,370.  That is an increase in the price of gold of some 6,530%; seen another way, the value of the dollar versus gold has fallen 98.5 percent,"" explained Jamie Jacoby with the Richmond Tea Party.

Those numbers do check out. But they are meaningless, according to C. Barry Pfitzner, a professor of economics at Randolph-Macon College.

Pfitzner noted that the U.S. is no longer on the gold standard, which ended in 1914. Even the gold ""exchange"" standard -- under which official holders of dollars like foreign banks and treasuries could convert dollar holdings to gold -- ended in 1971.

""The current market gold price is nothing more than the equivalent of any other speculative commodity.  Not unlike, say, silver, diamonds, platinum -- or for that matter, hog futures,"" Pfitzner said. ""So one could argue that the dollar has lost 98 percent of its power to purchase gold.  So what? Irrelevant. And the Fed is not to blame. It does not control the price of gold.""

Dean Croushore, chair of the economic department in University of Richmond’s Robins School of Business, agreed.  

""Economists generally think of purchasing power as the amount of goods that a person can buy with a dollar, not the amount of gold that a person can buy with a dollar,"" he said. ""Measuring the amount of goods that one can buy with a dollar is best done using a price index, such as the consumer price index.""

Well, that’s easy enough.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Price Index inflation calculator, a dollar in 1913 had the same buying power as $22.09 today, about a 95 percent decline.

Rather than the gold standard, the BLS calculator uses the average Consumer Price Index for a given calendar year. That data represents changes in prices of all goods and services purchased for consumption by urban households.

Now, on to the next point. Is the Fed really responsible for the dollar's decline in value over 90-plus years?

""That is not a great record and the blame does belong with the Federal Reserve, especially in the high inflation years from the mid-1960s to the early 1980s,"" Croushore said. He added that the Fed’s record ""improved in the past 20 years, when the average annual inflation rate has been 2.5 percent.""

Pfitzner noted two problems with putting all the blame on the Fed: the change in what money is used for and the difference in incomes.

""No economist would argue that the index from 1913 is comparable to the index in 2010,"" Pfitzner said. ""The mix of goods that consumers purchase is entirely different.""

As to his second point, the annual income per person today is about $33,000 today, compared to about $400 in 1913. So while the dollar is worth far less today, we have far more of them to spend.

""If we blame the Fed for inflation (and the taming of inflation in recent decades), seems they should also get some credit for growth in real incomes,"" Pfitzner said.

Barry Bosworth, an economist at the left-leaning Brookings Institute, said the Federal Reserve isn't responsible for the U.S. dollar's value, which he called ""pretty constant"" relative to other currencies.

""The decline in the value of the dollar is the result of inflation, but advocates of the gold standard may argue that it could have been avoided if the U.S. had stayed on the gold standard, so they blame the Federal Reserve Bank,"" Bosworth said.

So let’s look back over the facts.

No doubt, the value of a dollar has plummeted since 1913, when milk cost eight cents a quart. The Tea Party’s says the buck has dropped by 98 percent, but its use of the gold standard to measure the greenback is not a relevant gauge. Using the Consumer Price index, as many economists recommend, we find the dollar fell by 95 percent since 1913.

So the Tea Party, despite its disputed methods, wound up with a figure that’s in the ballpark.

But in bemoaning the drop in value of a dollar, the Tea Party omits a huge mitigating factor: salaries have grown enormously since 1913 and consumers have more to spend. If the Fed’s historic handling of inflation is to be blamed for the drop in the dollar, it must be credited for the rise in wages.

Wisconsin Republican Party chairman Reince Priebus says President Barack Obama has added 141,000 workers to the federal payroll and wants to add 125,000 more
","
Eager to ridicule the economic stimulus package, Republicans long have pounded President Barack Obama for overseeing a rise in federal government employees even while private-sector payrolls have shriveled.

It started over the summer, when two Ohio congressmen -- including soon-to-be U.S. House Speaker John Boehner -- separately claimed the federal payroll had jumped by 400,000 or 590,000 since Obama took office in January 2009.

Those claims were greatly inflated by including temporary U.S. Census workers, PolitiFact National found.

Now the GOP is back with a new set of numbers.

In the wake of election victories, officials are working them into interviews and even social-networking messages, such as this Nov. 16, 2010 Twitter post from Reince Priebus (@ReincePriebus), chairman of the Republican Party of Wisconsin:  

""Obama has grown fed. payroll by 141k workers-not counting Census, postal, & uniformed military. Wants to add 125k more.""

Priebus weighed in on this national topic -- coincidentally we assume -- about a week after his name came up in speculation about succeeding Republican National Committee chairman Michael Steele at some point.

Priebus’ tweet linked to a Fox News.com story that quoted U.S. Rep. Jason Chaffetz (R-Utah), who is in line to run a House subcommittee on federal employment.

Chaffetz was pushing a 10 percent across-the-board pay cut for federal employees. He told Fox that Obama had added 141,000 federal workers. The Fox story, without attribution, added: The president wants to hire 125,000 more workers.""

Since the numbers had changed from the summer, we wondered how the new ones added up.

First some context and history.

Federal employment figures are cyclical. They are lower now than 20 years ago. The federal payroll began a dive in the 1990s, rose again after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, held pretty steady for much of the last decade -- then began a sharp climb up in 2008, the last year of George W. Bush’s presidency.

The White House and private analysts attribute much of the rise this decade to homeland security and civilian defense positions related to fighting two wars and international terrorism.

Let’s start with how much the federal work force has gone up.

During Obama’s tenure, the number of federal workers has increased by about 141,000, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics -- though it is in large part a product of Bush’s last budget.

Priebus and Chaffetz did not include census workers, avoiding the misleading approach taken by Boehner and others.

They also excluded U.S. Postal Service workers in their count, which tallies some 2.19 million civilian federal workers. That makes the increase much larger than it otherwise would be, since the postal workforce is shrinking.

Got that?

If the postal workers cuts were included, the overall increase in employees under Obama would be about 40,000, or a modest 1.4 percent increase in the workforce. By leaving the postal service out, as the GOP does, the increase is 141,000 jobs, or almost 7 percent.

That’s a huge difference.

Tad DeHaven, a budget analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute, says postal workers are federal employees and should be included.

But government statisticians, the White House and some private watchdog groups routinely exclude postal workers in their reports. So Chaffetz and Priebus are not off base -- and both were careful to note which workers they meant.

A second caveat is more important.

Obama was elected in November of 2008 and took office in January of 2009. An analysis by Cato, the libertarian think tank, said the vast majority of spending for the 2008-’09 year -- which began a month before the election -- was from Bush-implemented changes.

If you start counting with the first full fiscal year under Obama, the job increase under Obama is half of the 141,000. But it’s also true that Obama picked up the ball from Bush and ran with it.

Let’s look at part two of the Priebus claim: that Obama wants to add 125,000 more workers.

It’s based on the Fox story, which did not attribute that number to anyone.

The 125,000 figure is an apparent reference to fiscal year 2011. But the 125,000 figure is not the projected job growth in fiscal year 2011 -- it’s just new hires, according to an analysis by the Partnership for Public Service, which provides research for The Washington Post.

Priebus’ tweet makes it sound as if that 125,000 would come on top of the 141,000 increase. But two-thirds of the 125,000 hires will replace departing federal workers, the Partnership estimated. So those positions won’t grow the number of federal jobs.

We won’t know until next fall, when the 2011 fiscal year ends, how many net jobs were added across the government.

But like any good charge, a pointed tweet doesn’t wait.

So, our evaluation won’t wait either.

Like others in his party, state GOP chairman Reince Priebus’ claim on federal hiring takes a statistical approach that makes the 2009-’10 trend more dramatic than under another method. And the claim pins the entire growth on Obama, while ignoring the budget implemented by Bush. But it’s a legitimate number, commonly used, and clearly defined.

The second claim is off base, using a new-hire number as a proxy for job growth to suggest that Obama would nearly double the two-year job growth in one year. The mixed message earns Priebus a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097720B80>],/factchecks/2010/nov/24/reince-priebus/wisconsin-republican-party-chairman-reince-priebus/

ODOT cites heightened Amtrak ridership in light of potential program cuts
","
Republican Gov.-elect John Kasich has made it clear he will cancel Ohio’s $400 million passenger train project when he takes office in January. Gov. Ted Strickland, who lost to Kasich earlier this month and strongly supported the project, denied Kasich’s recent request to halt spending on environmental and engineering studies related to it that already has topped $1 million.

Advocates for the project, which would use federal stimulus money to establish a Cleveland to Columbus to Cincinnati train line, remain hopeful Kasich will change his mind. While Kasich views the 3C rail corridor as a waste of money, supporters say it will create jobs and meet a growing demand for passenger train service.

The Ohio Department of Transportation issued a news release on Oct. 25 touting the increasing desire among Ohioans to travel by train. The department said ""demand for transportation choice is on the rise, with 14 percent more Ohioans riding passenger trains over the past year.""

ODOT, under the leadership of Strickland appointee Jolene Molitoris, is overseeing the $400 million rail project. Department spokesman Scott Varner said the increasing demand for passenger rail ""adds to the viability of the 3C. It shows there is a ridership demand.""

Even though Kasich seems determined to kill the train project, we decided to look into Ohioans’ supposedly increasing appetite for train travel. If accurate, it would be a worthy factoid for rail advocates to put before Kasich.

Amtrak is the only passenger rail operator in the state, according to the Ohio Rail Development Commission, so passengers on its trains would fully account for ridership in Ohio. To measure ridership, Amtrak counted the number of passengers who boarded a train or got off a train at one of Ohio’s seven Amtrak train stations.

The counting method exposes Amtrak to some level of duplication. If a passenger is traveling within the state – from Cleveland to Sandusky, for example -- he would be counted twice: once when he boards the train in Cleveland and again when he gets off in Sandusky. Spokesman Marc Magliari said Amtrak would not release statistics of intercity travel in Ohio because the information is considered proprietary. But he said such travel is rare. ""Most people aren’t going from Elyria to Bryan,"" Magliari said.

According to Amtrak, there were 128,174 passengers whose train ride began or ended at an Ohio train station in the 2009 fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30. There were 146,861 such passengers in the 2010 fiscal year. That’s a 14.6 percent increase.

The Inspector General of the U.S. Department of Transportation regularly audits Amtrak’s operations. Three such audits have been initiated so far this year. However, the Inspector General’s office could not say whether or not Amtrak’s ridership figures are accurate.

""We do not have any information that would lend to us having a response,"" David Wonnenberg, of the Inspector General’s office, said in an e-mail. ""We have not issued an audit report in which these or similar questions came up.""

Amtrak confirmed the figures on which ODOT relied to boast about Ohio’s spike in passenger rail ridership. The railroad’s method of counting passengers does leave some room for inflation. But since the same counting method was used in 2009 and 2010, such increases would occur in both years so the impact on the data would be consistent.

Bobby Scott says health care reform may cut deficit by $1.2 trillion over 20 years
","
In his quest to see all Bush-era tax cuts expire, Rep. Robert C. ""Bobby"" Scott criticizes Republicans for avoiding ""tough"" budgetary choices.

In a recent press release in support of allowing the tax cuts to expire, Scott, D-3rd, lambastes Republican legislators and President George W. Bush for enacting them without offering ways to cover the costs.

""Democrats can and have made these tough choices – most recently with the enactment of Health Care Reform, which provides the largest benefit to the middle class since the enactment of Social Security and at the same time reduces the deficit by nearly $1.2 trillion over the next two decades,"" Scott says.

Amid all the debate over health care reform, we wondered whether the new law really would slice the deficit by $1.2 trillion.

Scott, like President Obama in a similar claim check by PolitFact National, uses numbers from the Congressional Budget Office.

According to the CBO, the health care act is indeed expected to trim the deficit because tax increases and cost savings in the reforms are expected to outweigh the costs of its new programs and tax credits.

The projection for the first 10 years is solid. The CBO analysis says the health care act ""would produce a net reduction in federal deficits of $138 billion over the 2010-2019 period as result of changes in direct spending and revenue.""

But the projection for the next decade is far more speculative.

The CBO typically only calculates the impact of legislation's cost over 10 years. But it will create calculations for a longer period if Congress requests it, which many members did for health care reform.

Here's what the CBO said about computing health reform's effect on the deficit between 2020 and 2030:

""A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great. Among other factors, a wide range of changes could occur — in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care (such as advances in medical research, technological developments, and changes in physicians’ practice patterns) — that are likely to be significant but are very difficult to predict, both under current law and under any proposal.""

But the CBO was willing to estimate that in the second 10 years, the health care legislation would reduce deficits ""in a broad range around one-half percent of GDP.""

The GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, is the amount of goods and services produced within the borders of a nation during a year.

The CBO estimates the United States’ GDP will slightly exceed $22.5 trillion by 2020, up 4 percent from the year before.

To arrive at the $1.2 trillion figure, Scott is assuming that the GDP will continue to rise at that rate. And if it does, he’ll be right,  if not conservative,  in his claim.

Based on a 4 percent GDP increase each year with the deficit being reduced by half a percent, the deficit would actually be reduced to $1.4 trillion by 2030.e to the $1.2 trillion.

The GDP has risen by more than 4 percent all but five times over the last 50 years. Four of those occurrences have been in the last decade, including 2008 and 2009. Last year was the only time the GDP shrank in during the last five decades, falling 7.9 percent from 2008.

But looking at 20-year projections and using numbers that even the CBO says are dicey seems like shaky ground. Is Scott making a safe extrapolation or a leap of faith?

""I don't think $1.2 trillion is an overstatement,"" said Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

He said translating percentages of GDP into dollars is the only way to convey it to the public.

""It's perfectly reasonable to put that into terms people can understand,"" Horney said.

Even so, CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf noted that the projection is based on ""assuming that all of its provisions would continue to be fully implemented.""

That's a big assumption.

For example, on Dec. 10, 2009, the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Servicesissued a reportconcluding that the plan to reduce payment updates to health care providers through Medicare ""are unlikely to be sustainable on an annual basis"" and that further reductions in Medicare growth rates through the Independent Medicare Advisory Board ""may be difficult to achieve in practice.""

Robert Book, a health economist at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said a deficit reduction number extrapolated from a forecast of the GDP is dubious.  

""GDP estimates are extremely uncertain,"" Book said. ""Ten years ago, who would have predicted we'd have a recession last year? Nobody could possibly have known that.""

And besides, he said, if the plan reduces deficits ""it just means it raises taxes a lot.""

""So the number is probably not right, and even if it were, it's meaningless,"" Book said.

So, let’s review:

Scott says health care reform would reduce the deficit by nearly $1.2 trillion over the next two decades.

While it’s true that the CBO report he relies on says the health care bill -- with the proposed reconciliation -- would continue to improve the deficit situation in the second 10 years, it does not arrive at a $1.2 trillion figure.

To do that, Scott relies on speculative GDP projections to predict a number that that CBO itself says would ""not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great.""

So we rate the claim Half True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096874BC0>],/factchecks/2010/nov/23/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-says-health-care-reform-may-cut-defici/

""This investment will strengthen the surrounding Midwest economies through new rail and construction jobs, while also increasing development and connectivity from rural to urban areas.""

What happened in those intervening 15 months?

Well, after Republican Gov. Tommy G. Thompson and Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle spent years working with other Midwestern states on plans for high-speed rail, the Milwaukee-Madison link was one of 13 projects selected to receive federal funding -- $810 million -- in January 2010.

Then Republican Scott Walker made stopping the train a central part of this gubernatorial campaign, as did Republican candidates in Ohio and Florida. Now, Walker says Congress should allow the state to use the $810 million on roads -- though many, including Petri, say that’s unlikely. Other states -- New York, North Carolina, California and, of course, Illinois -- are clamoring for the money Wisconsin is about to take a pass on.

And, the state’s Republican members of Congress are, well, circling the wagons around Walker.

Thus, the November statement from Petri and U.S. Reps. Jim Sensenbrenner of Menomonee Falls and Paul Ryan of Janesville. It read:

""We support Governor-elect Walker's effort to put the brakes on the High Speed Rail budget boondoggle, which is why we introduced legislation, today, that would give states the ability to return federal funds obligated to high-speed rail projects, and instead use this money to reduce our nation’s $1.6 trillion deficit and $13.8 trillion debt.""

So, it’s time again to roll out the Flip-O-Meter.

Remember, we’re not passing judgment on whether the shift was good policy or even good politics. The Flip-O-Meter measures only how much an elected official’s position has changed.

Petri’s position was pretty clear in that first letter, in which he joined with U.S. Rep. Jim Oberstar (D-Minn.) and announced the creation of a congressional caucus to support high speed rail, including the network that would include the Milwaukee-Madison link.

That was the letter about a strengthened economy and all that rural-urban connectivity.

In many ways, the letter was in line with the views of Thompson, who was a strong backer of the high-speed network as governor and chairman of the Amtrak board. In September, Thompson did his own shift and said the state instead should ask that the money go to highways.

""I was supportive of high speed trains because I believe high-speed trains has a place,"" Thompson said at the time. ""But at this day and time and the circumstances we have right now, we can't afford it.""

Petri, a long-time member of the House Transportation Committee, said he was merely heeding the wishes of state leaders, first Thompson and then Doyle.

""My position was to make the strongest case I could for Wisconsin to have high speed rail,"" Petri told PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""That was successful.""

So, what happened since?

Petri said Walker’s election indicates that sentiment has turned away from the train. And if the train is stopped here, he wants the money to go to reduce the federal deficit -- not another state’s rail project.

But how do you square a statement about the project's benefits with one declaring it a ""boondoggle""?

Asked about the stark difference in the two letters bearing his boss’ signature, spokesman Niel Wright said Petri didn’t write the recent letter -- it came from Sensenbrenner’s office.

""Sensenbrenner is hotter on this and more determined on this than Mr. Petri,"" Wright said.

Indeed, in his interview with us, Petri sounded remarkably open to the need for a rail connection from Madison to Milwaukee and Chicago.

""It probably should be considered at some point,"" especially as Madison continues to grow, he said.

Petri also noted that the train was a ""pet project"" of President Barack Obama -- and that it was highly unlikely that the president would sign legislation directing the money for road work or deficit reduction. He said Wisconsin’s money could well wind up going to another state.

""If that’s the choice,"" Petri said, ""I’d say just go ahead with it.""

If so, the Flip-O-Meter will be back for the backflip.

For now, we’ll say Petri has gone from a full-blown advocate for the high speed rail project to signing onto a statement that condemned the project. And that’s a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097352800>],/factchecks/2010/nov/23/tom-petri/tom-petri-heads-opposite-direction-high-speed-rail/

Portland schools superintendent Carole Smith says high school makeovers will affect 40 percent of students
","


The last time Portland Public Schools asked voters to approve a pricey construction bond measure, the money was spread pretty evenly among all district schools. This time, schools superintendent Carole Smith proposes to spend the bulk of the $548 million, if approved, on eight schools, including a top-to-bottom rebuild of Cleveland, Jefferson and Roosevelt high schools.

As part of her pitch at a press briefing, superintendent Carole Smith said she chose to focus on high schools, in part, to reach as many students as possible in this first round. (If voters approve, every high school will be updated within 15 to 20 years, and every school within the next 20 to 30 years.)

""So high schools were selected on purpose because every student in a cluster will ultimately go to a high school,"" she said. ""So by doing three high schools, we essentially impact 40 percent of the students in the district.""

Forty percent sounds nice. It sounds large. And it’s an excellent selling point to recession-weary voters who may be struggling with the most expensive local bond measure in state history. Yet, the figure didn’t sit right with some reporters present. The three high schools currently enroll just 2,669 students -- a teeny amount of the district’s 47,000 students, and a figure that translates to 20 percent of enrolled high school students.  

PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know how Smith got to the higher figure.

So we went back to the superintendent’s office. Her spokesman Matt Shelby provided two pieces of information to back up her claim.

One, he said his boss meant to include Lincoln High School, since this bond measure would pay for pre-construction planning at the Southwest Portland school. Two, he said Smith reached the figure by including all students in kindergarten through grade 12 eligible to attend one of those four schools. ""If you include all students in the Lincoln, Roosevelt, Jefferson and Cleveland clusters, that gives you a grand total of 20,257 and that’s right about 43 percent,"" he said.

Maybe in a theoretical world with theoretical enrollment. The problem is that not all the students in a ""cluster"" attend that high school. Some enroll in a magnet school such as Benson, a charter school or an alternative school. Even more problematic is the inclusion of the Jefferson cluster -- because there is no Jefferson cluster. Students in the Jefferson attendance area are free to attend another high school of their choice, and three-quarters of students do, whether the schools are on the Phase One rebuild list or not.

Anyway, instead of counting cluster numbers, let’s take a look at projected high school enrollment figures to gauge the percentage of students served. (We’ll deal with the addition of Lincoln later.)

PPS projections show that by 2014 there would be 12,753 high school students. Of those, Cleveland would enroll, at the high end, 1,361 students; Roosevelt, 1,098 students; and Jefferson, 450 students. That totals 2,909 students, or 23 percent of high school students.

By 2019, under a very aggressive growth model, the district estimates 14,565 high school students. Cleveland would have at the high end, 1,590 students; Roosevelt, 1,365 students; and Jefferson, 650 students. That totals 3,605 students, or 25 percent of high school students.

Neither of those figures sounds remotely like 40 percent.

Now, let’s tackle the question of whether Lincoln should be included in Smith’s calculations. She repeats her argument in a fact sheet disseminated at the PPS site online. ""More than 40 percent of PPS students live in the attendance area of the first high schools to be rebuilt under the long-range program: Cleveland, Jefferson, Roosevelt and Lincoln.""

But Lincoln won’t be rebuilt with the money from this bond. Money from this property tax levy will pay only for design work, not for any of the far more costly construction work required for students to see a new high school. Voters will have to approve another facilities bond for Lincoln to be rebuilt. Smith is free to use Lincoln’s ""cluster"" to sell that levy in another six years, but it smacks of double-dipping to do so now.

Take a look at the estimated costs to judge for yourself. The cost to rebuild and redesign Roosevelt is estimated at $82 million to $86 million; Jefferson is $48 million to $52 million; Cleveland is $90 million to $92 million. And Lincoln? A wimpy $6 million.

Shelby said that even without Lincoln, the three schools have attendance areas that make up 34 percent of the school district. He maintains that the superintendent’s larger point remains valid: focusing on high schools will affect a greater number of children.

""I would argue that ALL students in each cluster would be affected. They ALL would have the opportunity to attend a fully modernized high school. Whether they choose to is another story,"" he wrote.

There are lots of reasons for deciding which schools to rebuild first and we won’t get into those here. But if school officials want to affect the most students by rebuilding three high schools, those schools would be Cleveland, Franklin and Grant. Together, they make up 32 percent of high school enrollment -- still not 40 percent.

The superintendent’s remarks clearly were an attempt to sell reporters -- and voters -- on the expansive nature of the expensive bond measure. But we don’t agree with the way Smith reached her number, by using clusters, and we don’t think Lincoln should be included when none of Lincoln will be rebuilt by the proposed bond measure.

The school district’s own projections show enrollment at the three rebuilt high schools will make up only a quarter of all high school students. Trying to inflate that number to 40 percent is ridiculous. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.

"['History', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says Thomas Jefferson called regulations an ""endemic weakness""
","
As part of his push to spur job growth, Gov.-elect Rick Scott has put a target on many government regulations. For example, Scott told business leaders at the Florida Council of 100 on Nov. 18, 2010, that he will freeze all regulations currently being formulated by state agencies so he can evaluate their impact.

""Regulations grow and spread like weeds — if we aren’t actively working to cut them back, they choke off every productive effort,"" he told the group, according to prepared remarks. (The event was closed to the public, so we can’t verify the quote.)

He added: ""This is an endemic weakness in government — so old that Thomas Jefferson listed this problem among his charges against the King of England in the Declaration of Independence. Jefferson wrote, ‘He (King George III) has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of officers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.' ""

Scott quotes Jefferson correctly. But we wondered, what did Jefferson mean when he wrote that line? Did he think regulations are an endemic weakness in government?

The ""swarms of officers"" Jefferson referenced were about 50 officials in the British Customs Service whose job was to stop colonists from smuggling goods to circumvent various taxes imposed by the Crown, including the Stamp Act of 1765 and the Townshend Acts of 1767.

Colonists were ""particularly adroit smugglers,"" said Stephen Lucas, a University of Wisconsin communications professor. The officials ""certainly were harassing to the merchants and the smugglers who were trying to evade the laws."" Lucas studies rhetoric and wrote the 1989 article ""The Stylistic Artistry of the Declaration of Independence.""

Lucas adds: ""He uses the term ‘swarms,’ which makes it sound like there are thousands of these officials. The point was to make them sound as onerous as possible.""

Jefferson was, of course, a politician. And the Declaration of Independence was a revolutionary document used to discredit King George III. ""What would you expect a guy to say?"" said Peter Onuf, an American history professor and Jefferson scholar at the University of Virginia.

Onuf, however, pointed out that the document was a critique of King George -- not of government in general. ""It’s designed to depict the government of George III as absolutely illegitimate,"" he said. ""The important thing is that it’s an argument against a particular government.""

He added: ""To take these phrases out of context and suggest they’re eternally valid under all circumstances, it just gets tedious after a while.""

Lucas said the Declaration’s famous preamble (""We hold these truths to be self-evident..."") includes principles that apply to any government. The 28 charges against King George are just that -- specific accusations against the king.

""In fact, the colonists tended to see these grievances they had against England as growing out of a conspiracy to choke off the colonies,"" Lucas said. ""They’re not necessarily an inherent part of government.""

Let’s circle back to modern times. Scott is clearly trying to bolster his anti-regulation argument with the gravitas of the Declaration of Independence. He calls regulation an ""endemic weakness in government"" and then says Jefferson listed ""this problem"" in the Declaration.

But Jefferson didn’t complain about regulation as an ""endemic weakness."" He leveled a specific charge against King George that, as Lucas points out, involved just about 50 officials to combat smuggling among the colonial population of 3 million.

Scott accurately quoted Jefferson, but he took the line out of context to advance his own argument against government regulation. Jefferson was no big-government liberal (He once lauded the ""suppression of unnecessary offices (and) useless establishments and expenses.""). But in this case he was more upset about King George than he was about government intervention. We rate Scott’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F1D880>],/factchecks/2010/nov/22/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-thomas-jefferson-called-regulation/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Trade', 'Sherrod Brown']","
Sen. Sherrod Brown cites daily deficit figure as pricetag for NAFTA, China trade deals
","
Congress may have no greater trade-agreement foe than Sherrod Brown, the Democratic U.S. senator from Ohio. 
It’s not that he says selling cars, soap and widgets to foreign consumers is bad. It’s just that some foreign trading partners use their cheap labor and weak environmental and safety standards to sell cars, toys and widgets to Americans at prices that our domestic industries cannot match while, according to Brown, adopting policies that make it hard to sell America’s goods abroad.  

So Brown was not saddened when negotiations for a South Korean trade deal went sour in November. After all, he said in a news release, more than 10 years of free trade deals have  ""brought a $2 billion per day trade deficit and the loss of millions of manufacturing jobs -- jobs that should go to Ohio's skilled workers.""

PolitiFact and The Plain Dealer expended plenty of bytes and ink on the lost-jobs issue during the election season, so there is no need to wade back into it here. Let’s just say that a persuasive case can be made, although the underlying data on jobs is poor. This country can send a man to the moon but it cannot precisely quantify the number of jobs lost or gained to trade.

But what about Brown’s other point -- that more than 10 years of trade under the North American Free Trade Agreement and trade relations with China has resulted in a trade deficit of $2 billion a day?

Causation of that kind is in dispute, and some experts and data suggest this country’s reliance on oil plays a big role in the trade deficit, with OPEC countries selling $76.4 billion more to the United States than vice versa so far this year. But imbalances with China ($201 billion and counting so far this year) play a bigger role, government statistics show.

We will not argue cause and effect here, nor will we tell you not to enjoy low-price consumer goods.  We’re merely examining the numbers.

They show that the negative balance of trade went from $70.3 billion in 1993, just before NAFTA, to $378.8 billion in 2000, as the United States accepted permanent normalized trade with China, to a record high of $759.2 billion in 2006, according to Commerce Department records.

So what of Brown’s precise number, $2 billion a day? Brown is right -- kind of. Or he’s not right, sort of.

This drives us nuts too, but as we dug into the subject, we realized that different groups use different measures to describe the size of the trade deficit.

You’d think it would be as easy as comparing the value of goods and services exported from the United States with those imported from other countries. So let’s show you some numbers from the Commerce Department using that exact measure.

Trade deficit for 2007: $702 billion.

For 2008: $698.8 billion.

For 2009: $374.9 billion. The recession’s effects were glaring, but even before then the trend was downward, albeit slightly.

For January through September 2010, the most recent measurement available, the trade balance was a negative $379.1 billion. Assuming the monthly trends hold through December, this year’s annual trade deficit should reach $500 billion.

Divide that by the days of the year and you’d have a daily trade deficit of $1.37 billion a day. That’s 32 percent lower than Brown’s claim of $2 billion a day.

But since flush times will return eventually, imports and exports will presumably resume at robust levels, too. So if Brown was referring to the trade deficits that existed before the recession, his statement would be nearly accurate, because the deficit came to an average of $1.91 billion a day in 2008 and $1.92 billion a day in 2007.

But it may not be that simple.

Trade balances are affected not only by wages, tariffs and the demands of consumers, but also by events beyond the recession such as currency corrections and the value of the dollar. Considering recent currency corrections, annual trade deficits could stay in the range of $500 billion, said William Cline, a senior fellow at the Peter G. Peterson Institute for International Economics. That would make Brown’s $2 billion-a-day figure somewhat high.

""It’s a bit of an outdated figure,"" Cline said..

Yet there’s another way of viewing the data. Figures from the Commerce Department that we reviewed originated from the U.S. Census Bureau’s economic analysis unit (a bureau within a bureau at Commerce). The figures are the government’s official measure of the trade balance, used by the White House, cited in the news media and accepted broadly by economists.

Yet the U.S. International Trade Commission, or ITC, which polices trade matters in the United States, maintains separate data that is used to review tariffs and trade practices. Depending on how one chooses to sort the data, a higher trade deficit can result. Brown’s office told us that his data came from the ITC.

So we, too, turned to the ITC, and its staff helped guide us in using its online database. The ITC cautioned that the official figures come from Commerce, but various trade professionals use ITC data to drill down further for other purposes.

We drilled. The result: A much higher trade deficit -- as high as $500.9 billion last year, in the depths of the recession, and $800 billion -- averaging $2.19 billion a day -- for 2008.

How can one agency have such different figures from another?

It’s easy. The ITC, concerned with tariffs, trade laws and trade policy, measures the value of goods -- cars, factory equipment, steel -- but not services. Services represent only a portion of the trade universe, yet they add a sweet spot to the equation. This country had a $132 billion trade surplus in services last year because it exported more in the way of travel, financial services, information services and so forth, than it brought in.

Take away those services -- or just look at the ITC numbers -- and the trade balance becomes more bleak.

It’s important to remember that when the White House and news reports mention the trade deficit, they are including services as well as goods and relying on the Commerce numbers. Even the ITC stressed this with us. But Brown aides as well as representatives of Public Citizen, a liberal public interest group, and its Global Trade Watch project, say the ITC data can be more relevant in certain circumstances.

A state like Ohio exports relatively little in the way of services, for example, so the ITC’s focus on goods may be more pertinent for measuring trade’s impact in Ohio, said Todd Tucker, research director for Global Trade Watch, and Chris Slevin, a Brown aide who previously worked as Global Trade Watch’s deputy director. Even nationally, there is debate as to how much job-creating value can be found in export sectors like financial services and travel, Tucker said. Factories that make things employ a lot more people.

Not to complicate this further, but ITC data can be sorted in yet another way, making the trade imbalance appear to be even worse. This occurs when some foreign-made goods are counted as ""imports for consumption,"" an ITC category with an assumption at the port of entry that the goods will be consumed in the United States. The problem occurs, critics say, when these ""imports"" wind up being shipped back abroad after being stored here temporarily. That gives them a new category on the way out -- ""re-exports"" -- which is not the same as a simple export of a product made in the United States. So they were counted as imports on the way in, but not subtracted back out as regular exports on their way out.

This kind of counting, which defenders say has merit in certain circumstances, results in a higher trade deficit than when every product shipped in is counted as an import, and every product shipped out is counted as an export. By using these other categories in the ITC database, we calculated a trade deficit of $612 billion last year and a stunning $920.6 billion in 2008.

These are close to the numbers Brown’s office supplied to us initially, and they support his claim -- and then some.

So which figure is right?

It’s a matter of legitimate dispute. Global Trade Watch says the larger numbers are more revealing and pertinent in a number of cases, especially when comparing U.S. trade relations with individual countries rather than the entire universe of global trade. The National Association of Manufacturers says that’s nonsense. From ""time immemorial,"" the Commerce/Census data have been used, measuring the total value of goods and services in and the total value of goods and services out,  and that’s the only valid way to count a deficit or surplus, said Frank Vargo, the association’s vice president for international economic affairs.

""Inside U.S. Trade,"" a publication for trade policy wonks and attorneys, discussed this at length in a Nov. 12 article. It said that ""these different approaches result in widely different numbers when applied to both the global and bilateral deficits, and they have helped fuel and confuse a debate among stakeholders.""

Global Trade Watch is sticking to its guns, but so is the National Association of Manufacturers.

So back to Brown’s $2-billion-a-day claim: Is it accurate?

Brown, who has authored a book on what he calls the ""myths of free trade,"" derives his figure from the ITC, and while the ITC cautioned us that the official balance-of-trade measure actually comes from Commerce, it is true that some authorities regard even the outlying ITC numbers as perfectly fine to use in certain circumstances.

Yet even if we were to put those numbers aside and only use the Commerce Department numbers, Brown’s figures were close to the mark before the recession. This year is not the best year to measure the normal effects of trade, and no one can predict the future; perhaps the trade deficit will stabilize at a lower number such as $500 billion a year, or $1.36 billion a day.  Perhaps it won’t.

But based on the historical trends, regardless of which data source is used, we say Brown’s claim is Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809772A840>],/factchecks/2010/nov/22/sherrod-brown/sen-sherrod-brown-cites-daily-deficit-figure-price/
"['Federal Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Republican Party of Wisconsin']","
State GOP says earmarks ban passed due to leadership of U.S. Sen.-elect Ron Johnson of Wisconsin
","
In the week following his decisive victory over three-term Democratic U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, political newcomer Ron Johnson laid low, declining interviews with state media.

Turns out the Republican from Oshkosh was not inactive, though.

National media reports on Nov. 9, 2010, placed Johnson among a group of incoming senators publicly backing a ban on earmarks -- those tasty pieces of pork sprinkled by the thousands into the federal budget by individual lawmakers.

Reporters set up the issue as the first test of whether newly elected conservatives would take on  a time-honored Washington tradition -- bringing home the bacon. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Kentucky) and others opposed the ban, which is non-binding but symbolically significant.

On Nov. 16, McConnell dropped his opposition, the caucus endorsed the ban and it passed.

In a news release the next day, the Republican Party of Wisconsin lauded Johnson.

""Because of Johnson’s leadership, Senate Republicans adopted a caucus ban on earmarks, showing the American people they’re serious about cutting government waste and corruption. Senator-elect Johnson isn’t wasting any time in his push for reforms, and the Republican Party of Wisconsin applauds his efforts.""

Wow. Did Johnson, not even in office yet, really lead the way on the earmarks ban?

Let’s peek behind the headlines.

The Senate Republican caucus includes 46 members. Johnson is one of 13 newly elected Republicans. He was one of six incoming freshman to publicly agree to sign on to the earmark ban at the request of U.S. Sen. Jim DeMint (R-South Carolina).

Other newly elected senators hung back, and just four current senators initially joined DeMint’s group. The DeMint crew of 10, dubbed an ""insurgent group"" by The Washington Post, sent a letter to their colleagues urging support for a ban.

McConnell and another defender of earmarks, Sen. Jim Inhofe (R-Oklahoma), loudly pushed back against the ban in the days before the caucus vote. They said earmarks were a tiny slice of federal spending and important for district projects.
 
Inhofe told the Post that banning earmarks ""gives cover for big-spending members of Congress to look conservative. They start demagoguing the earmark thing and everybody goes, ‘Oh, they must be conservative.’""

McConnell and Inhofe reportedly lobbied new members to vote against the earmark ban, although Johnson says he was not contacted.

But the two backed off before the matter came to a vote, and on Nov. 16 in a closed-door meeting the caucus united behind a two-year moratorium.

Again, media accounts portrayed sitting senators as bowing to pressure from voters and the Tea Party movement, to which Johnson is loosely tied.

Johnson, by his own account, did not lobby other senators face-to-face on the issue. And he said he was not deeply involved with DeMint’s concerted effort, which dates back months.

""That all occurred before we got here,"" said Johnson. ""Quite honestly, we kind of stepped into this, having been asked to co-sponsor it (referring to the freshmen who signed on). And Sen. McConnell made his decision.""

DeMint, though, directly credits Johnson and the small group of early supporters for the victory.

Wesley Denton, DeMint’s spokesman, told us: ""Senator-elect Johnson was an early public supporter of the earmark ban. His leadership helped give us the momentum we needed to win.""

So, where does that leave us?

In the wake of the earmarks vote, the state Republican Party credited Johnson’s leadership for its passage. The ban was opposed publicly by the Senate minority leader, putting the outcome of the vote in question. Johnson, new to Washington, joined a small group who took a public stand, while some other incoming freshmen stayed on the sidelines.

Johnson didn’t take a role in arm-twisting on the issue. And he was not solely responsible, as the GOP’s claim suggests. But he and just a few others made a real difference in the outcome.

State Sen. Bob Wirch says it costs Wisconsin taxpayers more than $1 million over four-tear term to run the governor's mansion
","
The governor’s mansion -- a kingly abode for the governor and his family, right?

Don’t think like a peasant. It is so much more.

""Executive residences,"" as the National Governors Association calls them, are ""regarded as an important symbol of the state’s culture and heritage. As state treasures, executive residences provide an appropriate setting for official state entertaining and are often highly valued as a venue for community functions.""

Oh.

The NGA goes on:

""Given the critical role executive residences play in official state and cultural activities, considerable care is required in managing, staffing and maintaining the executive residence.""

Gee, sounds like that could get kinda expensive. Just how much does it cost taxpayers to run the Wisconsin governor’s mansion -- ahem, executive residence?

Too much, says state Sen. Bob Wirch, a Democrat from Pleasant Prairie in Kenosha County. Echoing a call he made in 2002, when Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle was elected, Wirch wants Republican Governor-elect Scott Walker to sell or lease the 34-room manor.

""Over the course of one four-year term,"" Wirch claimed in a news release Nov. 15, 2010, ""it costs taxpayers more than $1 million simply to operate.""

Wirch also noted Walker’s own call to citizens for ideas on how to make state government run more efficiently. After all, with a structural deficit, lost revenue because of a state Supreme Court decision and other issues, the new governor faces a projected shortfall of $3 billion for the 2011-’13 budget.

""It is hard to set a good example,"" Wirch said in his statement, ""if you are living in a mansion.""

Walker, who will be inaugurated Jan. 3, 2011, plans to move with his family from Wauwatosa into the residence, said his spokesman, Cullen Werwie.

He said Walker has no comment on Wirch’s recommendation to sell or lease the mansion, which is perched on the shores of Lake Mendota.

The home’s ""replacement value"" is $1.63 million, according to the state Department of Administration. But Wirch believes that with its 3.7 acres of land, the estate is worth more than $2.5 million.

Perhaps, like us, you’ve never been to the mansion (although you can see it in pictures).

Well, according to the Department of Administration, the state Historical Society and the office of first lady Jessica Doyle, it: 

Nice. So, who takes care of it?

Seven employees, according to Vicki Heymann, the mansion’s residence director. Full-timers include Heymann, a chef, a gardener and a ""facilities maintenance specialist."" The part-timers are a housekeeper, a ""laundress and flower arranger,"" and the head of the waitstaff, who has worked at the mansion for more than 32 years.

OK, now let’s get to Wirch’s claim that operating the mansion costs more than $1 million during a four-year term.

Wirch’s office said the state Legislative Fiscal Bureau put the operating costs at $265,000 per year. That would come to $1.06 million over four years.

The senator’s per-year number is a touch high, but his four-year figure of more than $1 million is on target.

The fiscal bureau told PolitiFact Wisconsin that the mansion’s operating expenses are budgeted at $262,500 in 2009-’10 and the same amount for 2010-’11, nearly all of which is salaries. That’s a total of $1.05 million over four years.

In fact, actual expenditures are running higher, according to the state Department of Administration. They were $290,462 in 2008-’09 and $273,340 in 2009-’10. If that were carried out over four years, the total would be $1.13 million.

Wisconsin is one of 44 states that provided a governor’s residence as of 2004, according to the most recent survey done by the National Governors Association.

Here’s how three of the other six treat their governors: 

OK, let’s bring all this mansion talk home.

In calling on Governor-elect Scott Walker to save taxpayer dollars, state Sen. Bob Wirch said selling or leasing the governor’s mansion would enable the state to cut more than $1 million over four years on the cost of operating the mansion. Based on the latest budget and expenditure figures, the operating costs do exceed $1 million over four years.

Also on U.S. Rep. Joe Barton's legislative bucket list? Retooling energy policy, he said during a Nov. 11 speech at the conservative Heritage Foundation, where the Ennis lawmaker specified something else he'd like to repeal. ""In a bill that passed in 2007 or 2008, we prohibited in a few years the sale of incandescent light bulbs, like the one that's shining on me right now from the back of the room,"" he said. ""And I was at Walmart this weekend buying some light bulbs and the traditional incandescent light bulb I believe you can get four for $1.99. The little squiggly pig-tail ones were one for $9.99."" 
Then the dig: ""Now, if you're Al Gore, you can afford $10 a pop for squiggly-pig-tailed fluorescent light bulbs. But if you're mainstream America, two or three kids, mom and dad working outside the home, that's not a very good deal. So I think repeal that law right off the bat to show that we're going to put market forces back into play. We'll show the American people that we're serious about an energy policy that actually produces energy for America."" 
Since we're not Al Gore, we wondered if we're getting a bad deal: $9.99 for a compact fluorescent lamp — the squiggly pig-tailed bulb Barton mentions, also known as a CFL — versus $1.99 for a four-pack of traditional bulbs. 
First, some background: In 2007, Congress voted to improve the efficiency of light bulbs. Then-President George W. Bush signed into law the Energy Independence and Security Act, which set energy efficiency standards for kinds of incandescent lamps (conventional light bulbs) and fluorescent lamps (CFLs). Barton voted against it — the law Barton now wants to repeal ""right off the bat."" 
While running for president, Barack Obama promised to sign a measure into law that ""begins to phase out all incandescent light bulbs."" He said the change would save Americans $6 billion a year on their electric bills. Last year, PolitiFact reported that no such proposal has made it into law, though in June 2009, Obama announced changes in lighting standards. 
Starting in August 2012, fluorescent tube lamps (most commonly found in offices and stores) and conventional incandescent reflector lamps must become more efficient. The government said those types of lamps represented approximately 45 percent of total lighting energy use. 
This isn't the first time Barton has spoken out against CFLs. On Sept. 16, Barton and two other representatives introduced a proposal to repeal the section of the act requiring that bulbs use 30 percent less energy than standard incandescents. In a press release from Republicans on the committee, Barton said that ""Washington is making too many decisions that are better left to people who work for their own paychecks and earn their own living."" 
Nick Prelosky, an intern in Barton's office, told us that Barton's point was ""that the CFLs are more expensive... a lot more expensive than the incandescent bulbs."" 
Barton's press office didn't return our calls on this topic, and after initial communications with Walmart's corporate headquarters, no one answered our queries. 
So we don't know which Walmart Barton shopped — there's one in his hometown of Ennis — or what the light bulb options were at the store. But at a Walmart Supercenter in Austin, we found a wide selection of bulbs and prices. We found a 15-watt dimming CFL bulb for $11.77 and a four-pack of 100-watt soft-white incandescent bulbs for 84 cents, an even greater price spread than Barton said. 
But a dimming CFL bulb that costs more than $10 vs. a four-pack of incandescents that costs about $2 isn't exactly apples to apples. We turned to a comparison of CFL and incandescent wattage by Energy Star, a joint federal program of the Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Energy. 
According to Energy Star, a 60 watt incandescent bulb produces a minimum light output of 800 lumens, about what a 13 to 15 watt CFL bulb produces. At the store, we found a six-pack of 13-watt CFL bulbs for $7.97. A three-pack was $4.28. 
Next, we went shopping online. Our ""light bulb"" search query on Walmart's website returned 136 hits. 
Again, bulb prices varied. A three-pack of soft-white 13-watt CFL bulbs costs $4.92, according to Walmart's website. A two-pack of soft-white 60-watt incandescents costs $2.54. That's $1.64 per CFL bulb and $1.27 per incandescent. 
On the pricier end was a two-pack of three-way CFLs for $19.84, which are only sold online, according to Walmart's website. That's $9.92 per bulb — the price Barton bemoans. A two-pack of three-way incandescent bulbs costs $4.26, or $2.13 per bulb. 
But bulb life is also a factor in cost comparisons. In August 2009, Consumer Reports reported that ""swapping regular bulbs for compact fluorescents can save you at least $30 per bulb over the life of a compact fluorescent lightbulb... Some CFLs now cost less than $2 compared with $9 to $25 in 1999. Several lasted five to 10 times as long as regular bulbs in our tests, and Energy Star-qualified models use up to 75 percent less power."" 
In its October issue, Consumer Reports found that the CFL bulbs in its lab ""have been cycling on and off since early 2009, or 6,000 hours. For comparison, a typical incandescent bulb lasts only around 1,000 hours."" 
Lastly, we checked in with the Light Bulb Shop on Austin's Burnet Road. When we explained the statement we were fact-checking, Martin Day, a salesman at the store, told us: ""You can get cheaper CFLs than $10."" The cheapest CFL the store sells costs about $3 each, he said — a four-pack for $12. The cheapest incandescent: 75 cents. 
Let's review the math. One 13-watt CFL bulb costs as little as $1.30 (the price for a six-pack divided by the number of bulbs), compared to 20 cents for an equivalent 60-watt incandescent bulb. But it would take at least five incandescents to replace it over the average life of a CFL. However, if you want a dimmable CFL, it will definitely cost you. 
On their face, the prices cited in Barton's statement hold up. Yes, you can go to Walmart and buy a four-pack of incandescent bulbs for $1.88 (online) or 84 cents (at the Austin Supercenter) — prices even lower than Barton aired — and a single CFL bulb for $11.77 (even more than he said). However, Walmart also sells some CFLs for less and other incandescent bulbs for more. 
More importantly, Barton ignores other relevant factors — wattage and longevity — that undercut a simple price comparison and his suggestion that a ""mainstream,"" two-income family can't afford such energy-saving bulbs. 
We rate his statement as Barely True. 
This story has been updated to correct the cost of a 13-watt CFL bulb to $1.64

Whitehouse says companies get a tax break for moving jobs overseas
","
It's bad enough when companies take U.S. jobs and move them overseas to take advantage of lower labor costs. But does the U.S. tax code actually offer an incentive for firms to engage in such ""offshoring?""

That was the assertion of Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse earlier this fall when he went on the floor of the Senate to argue for a bill, designated S-3816 and known as the ""Creating American Jobs and Ending Offshoring Act.""

The proposal, he said, ""would close some really perverse loopholes in the tax code that, right now, reward American companies for moving American jobs overseas. The law, right now, permits companies that close down American factories and offices and move those jobs overseas to take a tax deduction for the costs associated with moving the jobs to China or India or wherever.""

There's nothing controversial about allowing companies to deduct their expenses for doing business, but does the tax system actually help companies cover the cost of moving local jobs to another country?

Absolutely, said Thea Lee, deputy chief of staff of the AFL-CIO, a 12-million member labor organization that opposes offshoring. ""You can take a business deduction for the costs associated with moving the job. So if you close down your factory in Providence, pack everything up and have to train the workers and ship the machinery overseas, all the costs associated with that are tax deductions,"" she said.

As a result, companies get back roughly a third of their expense at the expense of U.S. taxpayers, she said.

""There have been a lot of attempts over the years to get rid of this,"" but corporation lobbyists have argued that the loophole is needed because it creates more jobs, said Lee. ""You can believe that or not. I don't give it a lot of credence.""

Robert E. Scott, senior international economist with the Economic Policy Institute, a liberal-leaning think tank that deals with issues of concern to low- and middle-income workers, confirmed that relocation expenses are deductible and that existing tax law makes no distinction between whether a company moves part of its operations to another state or to another country.

""Businesses that have expenses of any kind are allowed to deduct them against income, and that would include any kind of shutdown expenses having to do with a plant,"" he said. ""They could also play games, potentially, with writing down any undepreciated value, so if they decide to scrap equipment they're shipping to China they could write down the depreciated value and take that off against their taxes as well. Both are options available to companies, and I suspect they are widely used.""

On the same day Whitehouse made his statement, Scott A. Hodge, president of The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy, released a statement saying the problem that served as the premise of the legislation isn't as big as people imagine.

He cited a Bureau of Labor Statistics report from the second quarter of 2010 showing 338,064 mass layoffs. When seasonal layoffs are subtracted, only 6 percent of the remaining workers -- 10,206 people -- lost their jobs during that quarter due to any movement of work. When the destination of the relocation was known (most of the time it wasn't) about 29 percent of the movement was to places outside the U.S. We checked more-recent numbers from the third quarter of this year; they showed a similar pattern.)

""The bottom line is that offshoring accounts for a small percentage of overall job losses . . . The offshoring of jobs may make for good headlines and political points, but it is not supported by the data,"" Hodge concluded.

In this case, the bill, which would also have given companies two years of payroll tax relief for jobs they brought back to the U.S. from overseas, was opposed by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, in part because it contained another provision limiting the ability of companies to defer paying U.S. taxes on money earned overseas. The chamber argued that it would limit the ability to compete overseas.

S-3816 was essentially voted down Sept. 28 after it garnered only 53 of the 60 votes required to close off debate. Among 57 Democrats, 52 supported it (one didn't vote), 40 of 41 Republicans opposed it (one didn't vote) and the two independents were split. 
So the law Whitehouse decries is still the law. There is little debate that the current system allows companies to get a tax break for their expenses when they send jobs outside the U.S. 
We rate Whitehouse's statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809677F640>],/factchecks/2010/nov/21/sheldon-whitehouse/whitehouse-says-companies-get-tax-break-moving-job/
"['Children', 'Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Mike Villarreal']","
State Rep. Mike Villarreal says Gov. Rick Perry's administration proposed ending immunizations for 113,000 kids
","
Democratic state Rep. Mike Villarreal of San Antonio sees the potential for ""a public health disaster"" in a document that lays out options for cutting the state health department's budget by 10 percent, according to a news release from his office. 
""Perry administration proposes ending immunizations for 113,000 kids,"" says the subject line of Villarreal's Sept. 7 statement. ""We want Texas kids in school learning, rather than sitting at home or the doctor's office suffering from preventable diseases. ... If we don't prevent the spread of diseases among these children, we put at risk all Texas kids who are too young to receive their immunizations yet."" 
An end to immunizations for thousands of youngsters? We wondered if Villarreal's shot hit the spot. 
First, some background on the federal Vaccines for Children program, which Texas has participated in since 1994. According to the website of the Texas Department of State Health Services, the program provides vaccines to health care providers for eligible children, including those who lack health insurance and those enrolled in the Children's Health Insurance Program and Medicaid. In 2010, the federal government spent more than $380 million on immunizations for children in Texas, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
Carrie Williams, a spokeswoman for the state health services department, said 4.2 million Texas children qualified for the vaccinations under the federal program that year. To expand eligibility beyond the federal requirements, Texas pitches in some dollars so that any child who comes to a public health clinic can be immunized. The department is spending $7.1 million on the program in 2010-11 and expects to need $9.5 million for full funding in 2012-13. 
In May, Gov. Rick Perry and other state leaders, mindful of a looming revenue shortfall (lately pegged at $24 billion), asked state agencies to spell out possible 10 percent cuts in their budgets for 2012 and 2013. In August, the health services department laid out $238 million in possible reductions, with $7.7 million of that coming out of the state's spending on childhood immunizations. That proposal represents an 81 percent cut from what the agency expected to spend on the vaccination effort during 2012-13. 
The agency document, which Villarreal cites in his press release, describes the impact of the $7.7 million cut: ""At this level of reduction, the overall safety-net program will need to reduce the number of children being vaccinated with GR funds (estimated 112,661 children). A significant portion of these children could be affected."" GR refers to general revenue funds. 
The document further says: ""This could end the public health clinic policy of turning no child away and instead will result in public clinics making referrals for those individuals that have health insurance to their medical homes for vaccines. If families are unable to go to their referral sites/medical homes, then the children may not be able to obtain vaccination services and could fall behind in the immunization schedule, ultimately lowering vaccine coverage levels and making our communities vulnerable to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases."" A ""medical home"" is one's usual health-care provider. 
While Villarreal's press release also says the Department of State Health Services ""estimates that half of the children could be immunized through other programs,"" he concludes that the end result of the budget cut would be to eliminate immunizations for 113,000 children. 
At the agency, Williams disputed Villarreal's interpretation. She said 112,661 is the number of kids the agency estimated would receive vaccines purchased with general revenue in 2012-13. If the Legislature reduces the state contribution to the vaccine program by $7.7 million, she said, the agency estimates that half of the 112,661 children — about 56,000 — would not be able to receive immunizations at public health clinics. However, Williams said, that doesn't mean those kids would necessarily go without. ""They may have to seek their immunizations elsewhere, such as through their regular doctor,"" Williams said. 
And what would happen to the other 56,000 children? Williams said the agency expects that they would still be able to receive immunizations at public health clinics, but she did not specify how that would be accomplished. ""We likely will have to fill in the gap with vaccine from other resources, possibly federal sources,"" she said, because state dollars alone may not be able to cover all of them. 
Upshot: There's a 56,000 difference between the number of children Villarreal said would no longer get immunized and the number of children the agency says could no longer be served at public health clinics if the proposed budget cut happens. 
Asked to explain the discrepancy, Villarreal told us by e-mail that he issued his September statement after his office discussed the August budget cut proposal with agency officials. ""At that time, they communicated to us that the proposal would end funding for 113,000 children and about half of them could be expected to find services elsewhere,"" Villarreal said. ""That's what I said in the first two sentences of my press release. The agency now says that we misunderstood. The point is the same either way: A very large number of our children would be left without immunizations."" 
We asked Williams about that early September conversation between a Villarreal staffer and Nick Dauster, director of the agency's Government Affairs Unit. She said: ""There must have been a misunderstanding between what was said and what was heard in a phone call a couple months ago. Admittedly, it’s a complex topic that involves estimates and unknowns, and our early information could have been clearer, which is why we provided clarification."" 
The ""clarification"" was an e-mail sent from Dauster to Peter Clark, Villarreal's legislative director, on Sept. 1 — before Villarreal issued his press release — saying that ""an estimated 56,000 children could be affected"" by the cut in immunization funding. ""This represents children who receive immunization services normally paid for by general revenue,"" Dauster wrote. 
Finally, we explored whether it makes sense to ascribe the agency-level proposal to the Perry ""administration,"" as Villarreal's statement does. 
By law, the governor appoints the chief executives as well as the governing boards of some major agencies, including the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, whose Perry-appointed executive commissioner chooses the commissioner of the health services department in consultation with the governor. Also, Williams told us that the health services staff put together its budget reduction proposals with input from commission overseers. 
We asked Stephanie Goodman, a commission spokeswoman, if it was accurate to characterize the health services department ideas as ""Perry administration proposals."" Her response: ""No. Our staff developed the options."" She said the governor's office wasn't involved in deciding what cuts to propose. 
And how does Villarreal's statement that the Perry administration proposes ending immunizations for 113,000 kids shape up? 
We'll take his reference to the ""Perry administration"" as a defensible poke. And a state agency has proposed ending most of the general revenue funding for immunizations for that many kids. 
However, the suggestion that none of those 113,000 children would get vaccinated misstates the estimated impact of the proposed $7.7 million budget cut. While the state acknowledges that half the children would no longer be served under the immunization program — and some of those may have insurance coverage — it expects the rest would still get their shots at public health clinics. However, it says it doesn't yet know exactly how those immunizations would be paid for. 
We rate Villarreal's statement Barely True.

"['Florida', 'Frederica Wilson']","
Congresswoman-elect Frederica Wilson says hat ban started in 1800s but can be waived
","
Frederica Wilson was known as the Florida state legislator who owned a massive collection of fancy hats. But when the Democrat was elected to the 17th District in Congress on Nov. 2, 2010, to represent portions of Miami-Dade and Broward counties, her fashion statement ran afoul of the rules.

We learned of Wilson's hat woes from a Nov. 17 posting in Naked Politics, a blog by the Miami Herald:

""Wilson is hoping to have a conversation with the likely new speaker, John Boehner. At issue: whether or not the longtime lawmaker can wear her signature hats on the House floor. The House bars members from wearing hats while the body is in session, but Wilson said she believes the speaker can waive the rule -- which dates to the 1800s.

'""It's sexist,"" Wilson said. ""It dates back to when men wore hats and we know that men don't wear hats indoors, but women wear hats indoors. Hats are what I wear. People get excited when they see the hats. Once you get accustomed to it, it's just me. Some people wear wigs, or high heel shoes or big earrings or pins. This is just me.""' 
The blog post continued: ""Wilson had to take her hat off for her official congressional picture, but plans to appeal that ruling as well. She did wear her hat on the House floor the other day -- but the House wasn't in session.""

She managed to show off at least one of her hats in Washington, D.C.: she arrived for freshman orientation wearing a black cowboy hat with sequins, according to the Washington Post. 
Roll Call also wrote about Wilson's hat dilemma on Nov. 4: ""But while we expect Wilson to become the Hill's newest fashionista -- for better or worse, depending on who you ask -- she likely will have to ditch her trademark headpieces while she's on the House floor. Although there isn't a specific dress code, hats have been banned on the floor since September 1837. Even the late Rep. Bella Abzug (D-N.Y.) couldn't sport her trademark broad-brimmed hats when she served during the 1970s.""

This is not a serious heady matter. But the Truth-O-Meter was curiously scratching its head. Was Wilson correct to say that the rule banning members from wearing hats on the House floor dates back to the 1800s? And who can waive the rule?

First, a little more colorful background about Wilson and her hats that we gleaned from a May 11, 2009, Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times article:

""In a political universe dominated by men in dark suits, Sen. Wilson is the rainbow that cannot be ignored. She walks the halls of the Capitol flashing her custom-made, bedazzled cowboy hats and perfectly matched suits -- her own runway of eye-popping colors that are more suited to the Miami district she represents than to good ol' boy Tallahassee. Canary yellow. Five-carat turquoise. Cotton-candy pink. Cherry red. Rhinestone-studded black and gold. Here in the center of Florida's political universe, the loud wardrobe of the educator-turned-Democratic lawmaker sends a clear if unspoken message to fellow lawmakers: I am here. And attention will be paid.""

We reached Wilson briefly by telephone on the morning of Nov. 19 and asked her how many hats she owns.

""I've never counted, but I've been wearing them almost 30 years,"" said the former Miami-Dade school board member and state legislator. ""It's almost like a fetish. ... I have hundreds.""

Wilson said she brought six hats to D.C. and has been researching the rules about hat wearing and still hopes to speak to Boehner about the ban. Wilson said she would get back to us regarding her research on the hat ban and who she believes can waive it, but we did not hear back.

Now let's return to our research on the hat ban. The rules of the 111th Congress -- the current one in session -- state under ""Comportment"":

""When the Speaker is putting a question or addressing the House, a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may not walk out of or across the Hall. When a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner is speaking, a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may not pass between the person speaking and the Chair. During the session of the House, a Member, Delegate, or Resident Commissioner may not wear a hat or remain by the Clerk’s desk during the call of the roll or the counting of ballots. A person may not smoke or use a wireless telephone or personal computer on the floor of the House. The Sergeant-at-Arms is charged with the strict enforcement of this clause.""

We consulted Miami Herald reporter Lesley Clark, who wrote the blog item about Wilson and covers Congress. Clark obtained a copy of historic documents kept by the House and also forwarded to us a 2009 copy of the Constitution Jefferson's Manual and Rules of the House of Representatives. That document states: ""No Member is to come into the House with his head covered, nor to remove from one place to another with his hat on, nor is to put on his hat in coming in or removing, until he be set down in his place. Scob. 6. In 1837 the parliamentary practice of wearing hats during the session was abolished by adoption of current clause 5 of rule XV11.""

A document from 1907 in the same link above, sheds more light: we turned to ""Hinds' precedents of the House of Representatives of the United States"" written by Asher Hinds who was the clerk to the speaker. That document states that the hat rule was ""the fruit of considerable agitation. In early years, following the custom of Parliament, Members wore their hats during session.""

That practice however was challenged when Charles F. Mercer of Virginia proposed a rule ""as early as March 13, 1822: 'Nor shall any Member remain in the hall covered during the session of the house.' "" Mercer's proposal wasn't adopted, but other members of Congress also proposed similar bans during the next several years. A ban proposed in 1833 was rejected because ""Members would have no places in which to put their hats if they should not wear them, and also that the custom of wearing hats was a sign of independence of the Commons of England, and therefore a good usage to preserve the American House.""

A historical highlights document from the House provides a short summary of the history of the hat ban. That document states that member John M. Patton of Virginia defended ""the really harmless but apparently indecorous practice of wearing our hats ... Regarding then this usage as merely ‘the outward and visible sign of the inward and spiritual’ freedom of this body from all executive control or interference, let us preserve it. And whenever, if ever, our executive magistrates shall attempt to employ any improper influence on this body, let us be found with our hats on.""

But on Sept. 14, 1837, the House adopted the rule banning members from wearing hats during the session or by the Clerk's table during the call of the roll.

So far, Wilson is correct: the House ban dates back to the 1800s. But she also said in the interview that she thought that the House speaker could waive the rule. She said she wanted to talk about it with Boehner, chosen by his peers to be speaker of the House when the 112th Congress convenes in January.

We contacted Boehner spokesman Michael Steel to ask if he had the power to waive the rule, if any leader could waive it, or if it requires a full vote by the House when it adopts rules in January. Steel said he didn't know the answer.

We turned to the House Practice, Assembly of Congress (Chapter 5), which includes a section on Adoption of Rules. That section states that the House can adopt its own procedural rules -- and ""ordinarily the House adopts the rules of the prior Congress but with various amendments."" So it appears that the House in January could adopt a new rule -- say, allowing all hats or dress hats. But this document doesn't address either way whether any leader can waive a rule.

We asked Vincent Morris, spokesman for the House rules committee. He wrote to us in an e-mail: 
""Current Rules prohibit hat wearing so anyone showing up with a hat would likely be told to take it off. For the Rules to change, members would need to approve revisions when the next Congress starts in January.""

So for now, it appears that Wilson will need to persuade her peers to change the rule in January. The good news for Wilson is that if she ever wins a U.S. Senate post, she won't encounter this headache.

Unlike the House, the Senate doesn't have a formal written rule banning members from wearing hats.

""People don't wear hats in the Senate,"" said Senate historian Donald Ritchie. ""The Senate sort of adheres to an unofficial dress code but it's not specifically in the rules.""

The News Service of Florida wrote Nov. 17, 2010, that ""Wilson, not known for being shy, plans to tell Boehner she intends to wear hats -- not ask him for permission.""

""I’m not going to ask anyone,"" Wilson was quoted as saying.

This would not be the first time that Wilson ran into roadblocks to her hats. When she wore Davy Crockett style hats in middle school, the dean called her father to complain, but she and her father didn't give in, the St. Petersburg Times wrote May 11, 2009. In 2002 after she was elected to the state Senate after serving in the House, a senator -- not identified in the article -- complained about her hats at a Senate retreat. (The News Service article identified that senator as Republican Anna Cowin.)

""I thought, with all these problems we have, she's worried about me wearing a hat? Well, I just smiled through it,"" Wilson was quoted as saying in the 2009 St. Petersburg Times article. ""Sen. (Jim) King took care of it.""

An aside: we wondered if the current hat ban rule would prohibit religious Jews from wearing yarmulke or Muslim women from wearing the hijab or headscarf. Steel, Boehner's spokesman, said in an e-mail: ""The rule regarding hats has never been interpreted to apply to religious headcoverings.""

So does the headstrong Wilson have her facts right? She is correct to state that the ban on House members wearing hats started in the 1800s -- Sept. 14, 1837, to be precise. But can Boehner or any individual ""waive"" the rule? It appears that the House would have to vote on a new rule in January 2011. At this point, Wilson has not provided any proof that any individual could simply waive the rule. If she provides us such proof from her research, or if Boehner later responds with evidence that he does have that power, we could revisit this topic. But for now, we rate this claim Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFB55C40>],/factchecks/2010/nov/19/frederica-wilson/congresswoman-elect-wilson-says-hat-ban-started-18/
"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'State Budget', 'Pari Sabety']","
State budget director Pari Sabety says Ohio's economy is on the mend, stronger than when Strickland took office
","
The perception that Ohio’s economy is in terrible shape is a big part of why John Kasich is Ohio’s next governor and Ted Strickland will be Ohio’s newest unemployed citizen next year.  

Kasich hammered home the theme of 400,000 lost jobs in Ohio in his rather narrow win over Strickland. And it’s a perception that is a bone of contention with some Strickland supporters who see the state again on the road to prosperity.

State budget director Pari Sabety appears to be in that crowd. She spoke two days after the Strickland defeat at a roundtable discussion at the Columbus Convention Center as part of the Impact Ohio Post-Election conference.

During her Nov. 4 remarks, Sabety took pride in how the Strickland administration has managed the state’s finances during the worst recession since the Great Depression. To give those in the audience a sense for why she thought things were moving in the right direction, Sabety passed out an ""economic dashboard,"" a color-coded chart that depicted 11 key economic indicators shaded red, yellow or green.

Those indicators were a mix of red, yellow and green in Nov. 2007, and today they are almost all green, she explained to the audience.

Praising the Strickland administration fiscal management, Sabety said Ohio is now on a steady course. She added, ""The economy is on the mend. … It is in better shape than it was when we took office.""

That got our attention. Is Ohio’s economy really on the mend?  And is it really in better shape today than it was when Strickland became governor in 2007?

We first looked at the ""economic dashboard"" Sabety used to support her assertions.

Developed by Jim Koons of the governor’s council of economic advisors, the dashboard covers 11 categories, including Ohio’s employment rate, new building permits, wage and salary information, initial jobless claims as well as U.S. retail sales, light motor vehicle sales and other measures.

But the dashboard is only of limited use in evaluating Sabety’s statement, primarily because it dates from November 2007, not January 2007 when Strickland took office. Koons said he didn’t design it until November 2007.

Furthermore, it’s not designed to give a snapshot of Ohio’s economy at a given time, but rather more of a ""forward-looking"" sense of what trajectory the state is on. Ultimately, Koons said, it’s a tool to help predict whether the state’s revenue forecasting will be on target in the coming months — a handy thing to know if you are running a $25 billion-a-year enterprise like state government. And it’s weighted to favor the short term over the long term, he said.

Asked if the state’s economy is better now than 2007, Koons couldn’t say.

""I haven’t really spent much time thinking about that,"" he said. ""I would definitely say we are moving in a better direction.""

We put the same question to a trio of other independent economic analysts — all based in Ohio. They consider the assertion false, laughable and downright bizarre.

That’s because a state’s employment figures are the true measure of the health of a state’s economy, they all said.

""Frankly, an economist getting up in a meeting and saying things have improved in Ohio since 2007 would be laughed at,"" said Bob Rogers, an economics professor at Ashland University and former president of the Ohio Association of Economists and Political Scientists.

Said Ken Mayland, an economic analyst who is president of Clear View Economics in Pepper Pike: ""I think on the face of it that statement is blatantly false.""

Said George Zeller, a economic research analyst based in Cleveland: ""When you look at it in terms of jobs, it’s kind of a bizarre statement actually.""

All three said the state’s employment record is clear — 5.65 million people employed in January  2007 when Strickland became governor and 5.32 million today -- a difference of 330,000 jobs. And they all said that is clearly the best way to measure the health of the state’s economy.

""It’s a macromeasure,"" Mayland said. ""When people are employed they are producing things.""

Our trio of experts were somewhat more split when asked if Ohio’s economy was on the mend.

Mayland said he thought Ohio’s economy was definitely on the upswing.

""I do believe that the Ohio economy is recovering, we are probably going to get a pretty big share of the national economic recovery,"" he said. ""Manufacturing, in general, and the auto industry in particular, they are rebounding,"" he said. ""But when I say they are recovering you have to keep in mind there had been permanent job loss that will never be recovered, so they won’t get back to their former selves.""

Professor Rogers agreed there has been a bit of a rebound in Ohio’s economy this year.

""Steel has made a little bit of a recovery, but in the last month or two it’s backed down. The auto industry is better, but it’s certainly not back to where it was before the crash.""

Other outside experts have seen signs that Ohio’s economy is rebounding including the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia, which rated Ohio as having the fifth-fastest growing economy during the past 12 months. And personal income tax collections are up 5 percent in the first quarter of fiscal 2011 as well as sales tax collections over the past four months when both are compared to the same period a year ago.

By far, the most pessimistic was Zeller who said that small gains in employment in Ohio that have been reported are a mirage caused by a faulty national modeling which has overestimated new firms being born. He predicted that the state’s employment figures will be downgraded by 86,000 in January when the national model is evaluated by federal officials erasing, the 15,000 or so jobs that Ohio has gained on paper in 2010. Instead, Ohio will have lost 70,000 jobs this year.

""There is no evidence at all that Ohio has gained even one job in 2010,"" said Zeller. ""Ohio is still losing jobs right now, so therefore the economy is not on the upswing. I will say that the rate at which we’re losing jobs has slowed dramatically.""

Zeller compared it to a football team that is getting destroyed, but manages to tack on a few points. ""If the Browns are behind 48-0, and they kick a field goal, are things on the upswing?"" he asked. ""Well, yes, because they have three points now, but they are still way behind. That’s kind of the position the state’s economy is in.""

So add it all up, and what do we have: 
Allowing for the evidence that Ohio’s economy is rebounding, we’ll give Sabety credit for the first part of her claim. But we take away points for the second part.

We rate her statement that the economy is on the mend and that it is in better shape than when Strickland took office to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A412840>],/factchecks/2010/nov/19/pari-sabety/state-budget-director-pari-sabety-says-ohios-econo/

Virginia Tea Party says dollar has fallen 44 percent under Bernanke
","

The Virginia Tea Party Patriot Federation has joined a growing chorus of conservatives blasting Federal Reserve System Chairman Ben Bernanke’s plan to buy $600 billion in additional U.S. Treasury bonds.

In a sharply worded open letter to Virginia’s Congressional delegation, the Federation asks legislators to slow the printing of U.S. currency, curtail spending and audit the Fed.

""Chairman Bernanke's new program, which the Fed says it will ‘adjust as needed,’ is an open-ended threat to the U.S. Dollar,"" the letter states. ""Americans have to stop and question why our sovereign currency, the U.S. dollar, has fallen over 44% since Bernanke began pumping money into the system beginning back in 2002.""

The 44 percent figure piqued our interest and we wondered what they were measuring the dollar against.

Asked for the source of their information, the letter’s co-authors, Jamie Jacoby and Bob Marcellus, referred to a 2008 Forbes magazine column by economist Steve Hanke.

""The currency began its downward course early in 2002, thanks in large part to Fed policy, and it bottomed out in mid-July 2008, having declined 44% against the euro in that period,"" Hanke wrote.  

OK, so we now know that the dollar’s decline in the claim is set against the euro standard. But, 2008 was a while ago, so we wondered how the dollar compared to the euro today versus 2002.

As of Nov. 15, the EUR/USD rate (American dollars to one euro) is at 1.36 compared with 0.87 in February 2002, a drop of 56 percent.

But that brings up the second issue with the claim -- Bernanke didn’t join the Federal Reserve System’s Board of Governors until September 2002, not early 2002 when the dollar began to decline. Bernanke didn’t become chairman until 2006, succeeding Alan Greenspan.

""I think it’s foolish to assign blame for the U.S. foreign exchange rate to Dr. Bernanke when he was a member but not the Chair of the Federal Reserve,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the left-leaning Brookings Institution. ""How much influence can a single, very junior member of the Board have?""

Dan Mitchell, a senior fellow at the free-market Cato Institute, saw that point, but added that Bernanke wasn’t exempt from responsibility.

""Greenspan was the Chairman, so he really deserves a lot of the blame,"" Mitchell said, ""On the other hand, Bernanke supported those policies.""

So, let’s get back to numbers.

If we look at change in the EUR/USD rate from September 2002, when Bernanke joined the Fed, until now, it has gone from 0.98 to 1.36, meaning that the value of the dollar has dropped 39 percent.  By that measure, we’re pretty close to the 44 percent used in the claim.

Is that good enough? Maybe not, says Burtless.

""The reason I do not take the letter writer’s claim very seriously is that he or she has selected just one currency to judge the trend in the value of the dollar,"" he said. ""It happens to be a currency that has appreciated relative to the dollar. Other currencies have fallen in value relative to the dollar.""  

Burtless suggested using another measure to track the change -- the trade-weighted U.S. Dollar Index, a broad measure of the value of the U.S. dollar against the currencies of our major trading partners.

From September 2002 through Nov.15, the index has fallen from 126.17 to 98.82, a 22 percent decline.

But as Mitchell points out, the euro/dollar comparison is commonly used and widely accepted.

""If we shift from surface-level political debates to academic analysis, then a broader measure of currencies would be a better benchmark,"" he said. ""After all, what if the dollar was falling because of something that the [European Central Bank] was doing rather than easy-money policy by the Fed?  But the euro is the benchmark, so that is how the debate is usually framed in DC.""

If we to accept that, is it fair to lay all the blame on the Fed? Robertson says no.

""Part of the decline since the worst of the crisis, say, late 2008-spring 2009, is due to the rebound of other major currencies,"" he said.  ""The dollar almost always rallies in crises (it's a safe haven for worriers), so the subsequent decline in normal times is to be expected. In the longer run the dollar's decline is because our industries are not internationally competitive with a high dollar, and that has little to do with Bernanke or the Fed.""

To summarize: The Tea Party’s letter says that the dollar has fallen 44 percent ""since Bernanke began pumping money into the system beginning back in 2002.""

The number that the Tea Party uses reflects a different time period than Bernanke’s actual term as chairman and even as a member of the Board of Governors. Since Bernanke joined the Board in 2002, the value of the dollar dropped 39% against the euro, not 44%.

The Tea Party’s statement also relies on one measurement of U.S. currency -- against the euro -- instead of a broader comparison to several major world currencies. Using that standard, the dollar has fallen 22%.

Nevertheless, the letter’s point that the value of the dollar has fallen sharply since 2002 is undeniable, even if the decline is more gradual using indexes other than the euro and even if Bernanke had limited influence for four of the eight years.

Therefore, we find the claim to be Half True.

"['Wisconsin', 'Jeff Scrima']","
Looking at Waukesha Mayor Jeff Scrima and his ""half pay"" pledge
","
When 32-year-old political novice Jeff Scrima joined the April 2010 race for Waukesha mayor, he felt the city leaders were ""out of touch,"" pointing to the decision to give raises to the mayor during the worst recession in 70 years.

So, this tag line went on his campaign literature: ""Will serve as full-time mayor on half pay.""

Promising to hold the line on taxes, Scrima’s lean government message carried him into office in Waukesha, Wisconsin’s ninth largest city and a suburb of Milwaukee. ""Being an elected official should not be about the money,"" Scrima said in an interview.

He added the ""will work for half pay"" slogan drew attention and seemed catchy.

Since taking office, the simple pledge has gotten a whole lot more complicated, from a new charitable fund to complaints from aldermen that his approach isn’t helping taxpayers at all. In the latest twist, Scrima told aldermen he’d give half of his future pay back to the city -- if they all returned to the city an equal share of their pay.

Boy, the Flip-O-Meter was built for situations like this.

Its purpose is to sort out if elected officials have changed their positions -- whether the switch is good or bad or in between is up to the voters.

Let’s start at the beginning:

The pledge

During the campaign, Scrima routinely repeated the ""work for half"" pledge in literature, interviews and debates. It was an echo of sorts to the pledges made by Milwaukee County Executive Scott Walker and other elected officials to return some of their pay to taxpayers.

The salary for the mayor of Waukesha is $70,100 a year and in April will increase to $73,100.

Scrima did not specify how he would handle the half of the salary that he would decline. But voters were clearly left with the impression that his pledge would reduce the cost to taxpayers.

Most politicians simply return their unwanted pay to the municipal coffers. Under state law, Scrima had 30 days after the election to tell the city if he didn’t want to accept full pay.

""The mayor did not do that,"" said Donna Whalen, human resources manager and assistant city attorney.

Such givebacks may make only a small difference in the bottom line -- Waukesha’s general operations budget for 2011 is about $58 million, with $51.4 million to come from property taxes. But they can be popular with voters.

""Most people never look at the benefits of how you give money back,"" said Kevin Kennedy, director and general counsel for the state Government Accountability Board, adding: ""For most people it’s a gesture.""

In any case, Scrima did not take the most direct route to accomplish his goal. 

The alternative path

On June 16, 2010, Scrima announced the creation of the ""New Day in Waukesha Fund"" and said half of his net pay (after taxes and health and dental insurance deductions) would be directly deposited to the fund with each pay day.

He launched the fund with a check for $2,787.34 - the amount that equaled half of his net pay for his first weeks in office. At the time, he said state law prohibited him from taking a half-sized paycheck. But that was only true because he missed the 30-day deadline to self-change the pay scale.

He could have written a check to the city with each paycheck, but did not.

The nonprofit fund, which echoes his campaign theme, is administered by a five-member board -- Scrima and four others he selected. The fund’s stated purpose is to ""provide vitality"" to the city through creation of gateways, memorials, beautification and arts, and collaborative efforts that benefit young people. So far, no grants have been awarded.

Contributions to the fund are tax deductible.

Scrima said he hoped the community fund would ""leverage"" other contributions once projects were identified. And at the time of the announcement he declared he had secured ""additional commitments already totaling $26,700 from the community.""

But so far, Scrima’s checks are the only ones that have gone into the fund, said David Schultz, president of the Waukesha County Community Foundation Inc. which handles the money at the direction of the ""New Day"" board.

So, let’s update the scorecard: Taxpayers are still paying Scrima’s full salary. Instead of returning the money directly to city coffers, the giveback is being put -- after taxes -- into a fund that gives Scrima more control over how it is spent.

During a recent meeting about the city budget, Ald. Chris Hernandez needled the mayor, saying it would help the tax levy if Scrima gave the money back to the city rather than his fund. 

The alternate alternative path

On Nov. 10, 2010, Scrima changed course.

He offered in a budget amendment to give half of his future pay back to the city as a way of preventing a tax levy increase. The catch: He would only do so if all 15 aldermen also agreed to pay cuts and return the money to the city.

That idea was dead on arrival, but it gives even more life to our analysis. If anything, the mayor’s proposed amendment underlines that the money is not going to the city now.

""I believe I’m living up to my campaign promise,"" Scrima told PolitiFact Wisconsin, arguing the city could enjoy greater benefits from his approach -- especially once others contribute to the fund. ""This is what I signed up for and I don’t regret it.""

The Flip-O-Meter came to a different conclusion.

The new mayor said he’d work for half pay. But under his approach, he’s taking the full salary and then putting money in a charitable fund, which carries tax advantages and control advantages. He has more say over how it is spent than if it went back to the city to hold down taxes. Creating the fund may be noble -- and clever, after all it is named after his campaign slogan. But it is not what voters could have expected based on his slogan. Scrima’s latest effort, to leverage aldermen into his pledge, underlines the half-pay is doing nothing to help the city’s bottom line.

All Scrima’s bouncing on the half-pay pledge earns him a Half-Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000002809756F100>],/factchecks/2010/nov/19/jeff-scrima/looking-waukesha-mayor-jeff-scrima-and-his-half-pa/
