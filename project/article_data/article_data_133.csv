Former R.I. Rep. Nicholas Gorham says state General Assembly 'has no explicit constitutional authority' to levy taxes
","Former state Rep. Nicholas Gorham made a surprising claim last month in a commentary in The Providence Journal. ""The fact is that we have a General Assembly that has no explicit constitutional authority to impose income, sales, estate and the myriad of other taxes upon us, yet it taxes the people as if there were no limitations on its authority to tax the people,"" he wrote in the piece, published Dec. 30. The legislature can’t legally levy taxes? This called for a PolitiFact audit. First, a history lesson. When King Charles II granted a royal charter to the colony in 1663, the document, preserved in a metal and glass case at the State House, established ""a form of pure government by an elected assembly presided over by a nearly powerless, elected governor,"" according to an account on the General Assembly’s website. The Assembly’s supremacy continued when Rhode Island became a state, and was reaffirmed in the state’s first Constitution, adopted in 1842. Article VI, Section 10 spelled it out, saying ""the General Assembly shall continue to exercise the powers it has heretofore exercised, unless prohibited in this Constitution."" The state Supreme Court consistently interpreted that to mean the power of the General Assembly was unlimited unless authority to do something was specifically given to another branch of government. Things changed in 2004, when the General Assembly, responding to pressure from good government groups, passed ""separation of powers"" legislation, a set of proposed amendments to the state Constitution. The amendments made it clear the government is divided into three separate branches, banned legislators from serving on any executive-branch boards or commissions, and gave the governor power to appoint members of agency boards. And they eliminated the catch-all Section 10. Voters approved the amendments 2-to-1.    So is Gorham right that, because of 2004 vote, the General Assembly lost its ""explicit"" authority to tax? On a literal level, yes. The only reference to setting taxes in the current Constitution is a section that says that the Assembly can set the manner in which property valuations are conducted. But legal experts say on a practical level, implicit can be as good as explicit. Former state Supreme Court Justice Robert G. Flanders Jr., who stepped down in early 2004, says that although much was changed by the 2004 amendments, much abides. From the days of Parliament and the English kings, he said, the power to levy taxes has rested in the legislative body, a legal tradition that was carried on in England’s colonies in the Americas. ""Inherent in the legislative power is the power to tax,"" Flanders said. ""You wouldn’t need an explicit grant."" Richard Raspallo, legal counsel to House Majority Leader Nicholas A. Mattiello, agreed, saying there are several examples of legislative power that is assumed despite a lack of specific language in the Constitution. ""Where is it explicitly stated in the Constitution that the General Assembly has the authority to require Rhode Island citizens to follow traffic rules, or have a license, or grant people the right to marry, or require people to have certain educational standards in order to work in certain fields?"" he said. ""At some point, the General Assembly has been granted power by the people to legislate for the common good,"" he said. ""That includes the imposition of taxes to pay for the welfare of the citizenry."" Gorham indirectly acknowledged that, but said the ambiguity shows the need for a state constitutional convention to settle the matter definitively. (Voters will be asked in November whether a convention should be convened.) As he wrote in his commentary: ""Of course, I plan to pay my taxes, but you really have to wonder sometimes. If the people really wanted to get taxes — and, yes, borrowing — under control and on the people’s terms, the Constitution, just the way it is, would be a great place to start. Let the revolution begin!"" Our ruling Nicholas Gorham said the Rhode Island General Assembly ‘‘has no explicit constitutional authority’’ to levy taxes. History tells us he’s right. Had he suggested that the lack of explicit language meant no one had to pay taxes, we’d view his claim in a far different light. But he didn’t, so we rule it True.

GOP says Alex Sink used a state-owned airplane to 'get to a vacation in the Bahamas'
","With the matchup now set for a March 11 special election for the U.S. House, the National Republican Congressional Committee has launched some familiar attacks against Alex Sink, the Democratic candidate and a former Florida chief financial officer. In a new Web ad released Jan. 15, the GOP resurrects charges from the 2010 gubernatorial race, when Sink lost to Republican Rick Scott. The new ads remind voters that Sink had once caught flak for using state airplanes. ""She used a taxpayer-funded plane so she could get to a vacation in the Bahamas,"" the video charges. It also lists a few other flight-related claims to bring the attack in for a landing. The state airplane episode was a big deal for Sink during her 2010 campaign, and the claim that she used the plane to get to the Bahamas was designed to cause her turbulence again. So we buckled our seat belts and looked at whether the NRCC had done its pre-flight preparations correctly. Frequent flyer Alex Sink was in the middle of her 2010 gubernatorial run when the Tampa Bay Times and the Miami Herald produced a report detailing her apparent use of state airplanes for personal and campaign use. The June 2009 report focused on Sink, then serving as CFO, and Republican Attorney General Bill McCollum, who was also running for governor, eventually losing the Republican primary to Scott. The Times and the Herald reported that Sink’s state-provided air travel had cost $413,334 between January 2007 and June 22, 2009. State law requires Cabinet members to maintain a legal residence in Tallahassee, and both Sink and McCollum had second homes in the capital. But the law prohibited them from using a state plane to commute to and from their residences in other parts of the state. The report prompted an ethics complaint against both politicians (and against then-Lt. Gov. Jeff Kottkamp, a Republican, prior to that). Sink was accused of misusing the planes for personal flights and campaign stops and for diverting flights to Tampa airports so she could travel to her home in Thonotosassa. The NRCC’s Web ad refers to the subsequent Florida Commission on Ethics investigation. In addition to a trip to the Bahamas, the ad said, she ""spent $400,000 of taxpayer money to fly around the state"" and ""used the plane to attend political campaign events."" There is a really big caveat here, however. The ethics commission found no evidence of wrongdoing by Sink (or by any of the other two politicians, for that matter). Former Assistant Attorney General Craig B. Willis was hired as a special advocate. He concluded that no state statutes had been violated, because there was no evidence of what he called ""wrongful intent."" The commission’s investigation found that reimbursement guidelines for transporting family and attending campaign events had been met, and that Sink’s use of the planes didn’t constitute misuse of state resources. Furthermore, Willis found that between July 2005 and June 2009, the term ""aircraft"" had been removed from a portion of a state statute that defined commuting for official state business. Willis noted that this left questions about whether the restrictions about commuting even applied to flying on the state planes. Ultimately, the complaint was dismissed. While using state aircraft to commute between a politician’s home and Tallahassee was normally not allowed, flying an official to a state function and back was allowed. The commission found 58 of Sink’s approximately 250 flights on state planes started or ended at either Tampa International or Vandenberg airport (which changed its name to Tampa Executive Airport in 2009). She had paid for about 190 commercial flights home during the time span in question. Sink said during the investigation that flying to one city for an official function with a stop at the official’s home or other desired destination, either to pick her up or drop her off, was ""common practice"" among high-ranking officials. Sink’s Chief of Staff Jim Cassady said her office considered the diverted flights acceptable if she had business in the destination city for pickup flights, or in the originating city for dropoff flights. Mike McClure, manager of the Department of Management Services Bureau of Executive Aircraft Operations, told the commission that the difference in cost when diverting a flight in this way was minimal. A March 3, 2009, audit of the department by state Inspector General Steve Rumph found that DMS billing procedures were ""adequate,"" but suggested the department clarify its policies and begin requiring officials to certify travel was for official business. The audit also said that Sink, McCollum and Kottkamp had been taking trips that weren’t obviously for business and that the practice should be ended. Rumph’s audit noted the inconsistencies in the statutes that may have led to confusion about the use of the aircraft. This led to officials using the planes for trips without official business purposes. The final version of the audit left out the inspector general’s findings that the trio had spent some $51,000 for ''unnecessary legs during business trips,'' of which $27,200 was attributed to Sink. DMS spokeswoman Cathy Schroeder said that portion of the audit was removed because the agency ""did not have any manpower to further investigate that."" When the commission asked Sink if she thought diverting flights to pick up her up or drop her off was an appropriate use of state resources -- even if it was common among top officials -- she answered, ""Certainly it was, or else I wouldn’t have been doing it."" Off to the Bahamas So what about Sink’s alleged trip to the Bahamas? On March 7, 2008, Sink and two staff members flew from Tallahassee to Miami to see the Florida International University's Wall of Wind exhibit and to make a keynote address at the South Florida Hispanic Chamber of Commerce When her official business was complete, Sink was entitled to a trip across the state to Tallahassee, but instead she diverted the plane to Fort Lauderdale. She was catching a Continental flight to Marsh Harbour in the Bahamas -- where her husband Bill McBride owned a condo -- for a short vacation. One staff member went with her to Fort Lauderdale, then flew back to Tallahassee. Sink paid for the Continental flight. The diverted flight cost the state $248, according to the Department of Management Services. Because Sink and her staffer were aboard, Sink’s pro-rated cost for the trip to Fort Lauderdale was assessed at $123.75 by the DMS, but since she was returning from state business, she wasn’t charged. (For reference, a Super Shuttle shared van ride between airports is $45 and takes less than an hour; a nonstop van ride is $126 and a private, reserved car is $175.) There are no major commercial flights between the two airports, which are only about 25 miles apart. The NRCC told PolitiFact Florida that the ad wasn’t trying to accuse Sink of breaking any laws, only that she had squandered state resources by taking a state flight in order to catch a private flight to the Bahamas. The ad’s wording, which Sink has called ""deceptive,"" is in fact somewhat misleading, as it could be interpreted as Sink taking a state plane all the way to the Bahamas. That would only be allowed if she were attending an official function there, not because she was going on vacation. In this case, she was diverting the state plane to an airport to get to a commercial flight, rather than Tallahassee. The commission’s public report, which was released in December 2009, found ""no probable cause"" that Sink had purposely violated any state laws in regard to the Bahamas episode. The report did recommend that the Legislature should probably amend the law to be more specific about how the planes should be used. In essence, the commission declared the law was too vague to definitively find any wrongdoing on Sink’s part. After Scott defeated Sink in 2010, the newly elected governor kept to a campaign promise and sold both planes, a 2003 Cessna Citation and a 2000 King Air. This put 11 pilots and support personnel out of work. Scott, a millionaire businessman, uses his own private jet to attend official functions. Our ruling The NRCC said in its ad that Sink ""used a taxpayer-funded plane so she could get to a vacation in the Bahamas."" It’s true that she was headed to a vacation in the Bahamas, and it’s also correct that she took a state plane to reach her flight from the mainland after finishing her official business in Miami. What’s not so obvious from the ad is that Sink was cleared of any violations of state law, and that her diversion of the flight headed back to Tallahassee was common practice at the time among senior officials. Even if the flight took her only 25 miles, it still can be construed as Sink’s using the plane to ""get to a vacation in the Bahamas."" However, we think most reasonable people would read this phrasing as suggesting that Sink took a state plane all the way to her island destination, which she did not. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/jan/17/national-republican-congressional-committee/gop-says-alex-sink-used-state-owned-airplane-get-v/

Viral Internet meme says U.S. government predicted in 1916 that hemp would soon be dominant for making paper
","With the recent legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado, pot is hot. So when a reader was curious about the accuracy of an Internet meme about hemp -- a close botanical cousin of marijuana that has been caught up on in the war on drugs -- they sent it our way. The graphic says: ""In 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down."" The claim has proliferated all over the Internet. Sometimes a source is listed (such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture archives), but none of the repetitions ever seems to have a checkable citation, much less a direct link to a verifiable source. We decided to take a closer look. First, some background on hemp. Hemp and marijuana are both varieties of the cannabis plant, but hemp has much lower levels of THC, the psychoactive compound that makes marijuana a drug. Over the years, hemp has been used to make a wide variety of products, from rope, fabrics and paper to food and fuel, but its use in the United States dwindled after World War II. After more than a decade of dormancy as a crop in the United States, hemp was effectively outlawed by the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, which drew no distinctions between hemp and cannabis, presumably because the two plants look so similar that it would be easy to conceal illegal marijuana plants in a field of hemp. Some states have since loosened their laws about hemp cultivation, but federal law remains a steep obstacle to efforts to revive the domestic hemp industry. Because the legal fates of marijuana and hemp have been closely intertwined over the years, supporters of decriminalizing marijuana have often made common cause with those who would like to revive hemp as a crop in the United States. That’s why the Internet meme we are checking struck a chord among marijuana-legalization supporters on social media. Still, widely believed doesn’t necessarily mean correct. Did the U.S. government really predict that hemp would, in the course of three decades, make wood obsolete as the raw material for making paper? The notion is not entirely implausible. The Agriculture Department does have ""a lot of pre-World War II material on hemp,"" said Wayne Olson, a librarian at the National Agricultural Library, which is part of the Agriculture Department. That’s because hemp was once a cultivated crop in many states, especially Kentucky. The best known of these Agriculture Department documents is Bulletin 404, which features a pair of studies published in 1916 that investigate the plausibility of using hemp hurds -- a part of the hemp plant -- to make paper. This document has played a key role in the arguments of those who support legalizing hemp and marijuana, due partly to numerous citations in The Emperor Wears No Clothes, a book initially published in 1985 by the late Jack Herer, a pro-cannabis activist. Herer’s volume has been widely read within the pro-cannabis community, though it’s been questioned by historians for the quality of its scholarship. Even though Bulletin 404 was mentioned at several points in The Emperor Wears No Clothes, Herer’s book never makes the claim circulating in the Internet meme we’re checking. More to the point, when we looked at Bulletin 404 itself, we couldn’t find any reference to a prediction that ""by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp."" The papers that comprise Bulletin 404 are highly technical, dwelling on matters such as how much caustic soda was used in the tests and how to measure ""unsieved hurds."" Truth be told, the authors’ powers of prediction were rather faulty. They wrote that ""there appears to be little doubt that under the present system of forest use and consumption, the present supply can not withstand the demands placed upon it."" As anyone who uses paper knows, that certainly didn’t come to pass. Nor did the authors’ prediction that, ""without doubt, hemp will continue to be one of the staple agricultural crops of the United States."" And even that is not the same thing as predicting that all paper will eventually come from hemp. So Bulletin 404 is a dead end. What about other papers? Tom Murphy, the National Outreach Coordinator with the group Vote Hemp, pointed us to one additional document dating from around the same time -- a 72-page chapter from the Yearbook of the United States Department of Agriculture for 1913. But this document didn’t make the claim we’re checking, either. Olson of the National Agricultural Laboratory was skeptical that the claim actually exists somewhere in the department’s archives. ""I have been here since 1987 and have a pretty good idea what’s in the collection, but I have not heard that quote,"" he said. And Joseph Schwarz of the National Archives and Records Administration said that his office, at our request, searched the general correspondence on hemp for 1916 and 1917 as well as the Online Public Access Catalog. Such a claim could not be located, he said. Academics expressed skepticism that the claim was made. ""I never encountered this statement,"" said Michael Schaller, a University of Arizona historian. ""At various times there have been many claims about hemp, so it is possible someone, somewhere, sometime, said it. But I have not seen it in any original source."" Ralph Weisheit, a professor of criminal justice sciences at Illinois State University and author of Domestic Marijuana: A Neglected Industry, agreed that ""it doesn't sound right. This was a time in our nation's history when trees were abundant, and I'd be surprised if a government agency was completely ruling them out as a source for paper."" Ten other experts told PolitiFact that they had never heard of this claim, had never seen it persuasively documented, or both. ""I have read Bulletin 404 carefully and can see no such claim,"" said Samuel Thayer, an expert in edible wild plants, author of The Forager’s Harvest, and creator of the Hemphoax.org website, which casts doubt on a wide variety of claims by hemp advocates. ""It is possible the source is something else, but since I have not seen the claim referenced to any document in particular, and I know of no other USDA document regarding hemp from that year, that is my working hypothesis about where it came from."" Our ruling The Facebook post said that ""in 1916, the U.S. government predicted that by the 1940s all paper would come from hemp and that no more trees would need to be cut down."" The most plausible source for this -- Bulletin 404 -- is silent on this claim, and neither our own research nor any of the dozen experts we asked was able to come up with a definitive source. As with all claims of this type, it’s impossible to prove a negative, so we are willing to re-rate this claim if credible evidence emerges. However, our best efforts have turned up nothing more than a puff of smoke. Since the claim is unsupported, we rate it False.",/factchecks/2014/jan/17/facebook-posts/viral-internet-meme-says-us-government-predicted-1/

Obama says U.S. produces more oil than it imports for first time in nearly 20 years
","President Barack Obama this week touted the progress his administration has made in recovering from the economic recession, focusing on developments in engineering and manufacturing.   ""Thanks to the hard work and sacrifice of the American people, the good news is the economy is growing stronger,"" he said in a speech on Jan. 15, 2014, at North Carolina State University. ""Our businesses have now created more than 8 million new jobs since we hit bottom. Because of an all-of-the-above strategy for American energy, for the first time in nearly two decades, we produce more oil here in the United States than we buy from the rest of the world."" PolitiFact wanted to know if Obama’s claim gives us an accurate picture of U.S. oil numbers. A spokesman offered up this White House blog post that touches on Obama’s point in more detail. Domestic crude oil production surpassed crude oil imports in October 2013 for the first time since 1995. We also consulted the U.S. Energy Information Administration. According to their November 2013 report, the United States produced an average of 7.8 million barrels of oil per day in October and imported 7.5 million barrels of oil per day. So Obama’s numbers add up. How did we arrive at this point? Kenneth Medlock, an economics professor at Rice University who serves as the senior director for the Center for Energy Studies, said there are a couple of reasons why production exceeds imports. ""Yes, we are producing more than we import now, but that owes to both increased production domestically and reduced demand,""Medlock said. The reduced demand is due in part to the recession. It’s no surprise that people cut back on gasoline consumption when there’s less money in their wallets, so that lowers demand. And if demand is down, the United States doesn’t need to import as much oil supply. Another cause of reduced demand is increased energy efficiency. Over the last few years, rising popularity of fuel-efficient vehicles and other innovations have led consumers and businesses to spend less on utilities and at the pump, said John Lowe, a senior associate dean and energy law professor at Southern Methodist University. Aside from reduced demand, Medlock also mentioned increased production as another reason the United States is producing more oil than it's importing. We can credit increased domestic production to innovation in regulatory infrastructure. That includes factors like the ability for companies to negotiate directly with private landowners about mineral rights, as well as open access to pipelines. But we can’t tie these developments back to one president, Medlock said. They go back a couple of decades. Still, it’s worth noting that Obama is a known supporter of energy efficiency. When he campaigned for office, he promised to reduce the country’s dependency on foreign oil. In 2012, we rated that Promise Kept based on projections of the impact of his administration’s fuel efficiency standards. Our ruling Obama said the United States is producing more oil domestically than it’s importing from the rest of the world for the first time in nearly two decades. That claim is on the money. However, a lot of this has been in the works for awhile, including dynamics that pre-date the Obama administration. Experts told us the new dynamic is due to factors like the recession, increased fuel efficiency and ramped up domestic oil production. As a simple statement on where we stand on oil exports vs. imports, though, Obama’s claim is accurate. We rate it True.",/factchecks/2014/jan/17/barack-obama/obama-says-us-produces-more-oil-it-imports-first-t/

'Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries,' says author Lisa Bloom
","As shootings at a Florida theater and a New Mexico school rocked the news this week, CNN host Piers Morgan greeted viewers Tuesday with alarming stats about gun violence. Then one of Morgan’s guests jumped in with numbers of her own. After questioning the sheriff investigating the theater killing, Morgan turned to Lisa Bloom, a lawyer and author of Swagger: 10 Urgent Rules for Raising Boys in an Era of Failing Schools, Mass Joblessness, and Thug Culture. ""Let me give you another number: 20,"" Bloom said. ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries. Why? Because other civilized countries rein in guns."" We can’t quantify whether gun policies are preventing gun violence, as Bloom said, but we can look at her claim that ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" First of all, it’s not typical to refer to peers of the United States as ""civilized countries."" More often, they are grouped as ""developed,"" ""advanced industrial"" or ""high-income countries,"" many being in Western Europe. When we asked Bloom what she meant, she directed us to a Washington Post infographic comparing gun-related murders per capita for the United States and the nations of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. The global consortium of 34 countries includes Western Europe, Turkey, Israel, Chile, Japan and South Korea. Mexico is also in the group, but the Post did not include it because its murder rate is exceptionally high amid a drug war. (The OECD considers all but Mexico, Chile and Turkey as ""advanced"" countries. Those three are ""emerging."") The United States is tops -- way tops -- for gun deaths, with a 2010 rate of 3.2 firearm-related deaths per 100,000 population, according to statistics collected by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. Chile was second at 2.2, followed by Turkey and Switzerland, tied for third at 0.8. The rest of the countries fell below 1, if they made the map at all. The U.S. rate is more than 20 times the rate of Australia, France, the United Kingdom (excluding Northern Ireland), Israel, South Korea, Japan, Norway, Poland and Slovenia. The U.S. rate firearm-related deaths is closer to 10 or 16 times the rates of countries such as Austria, Denmark, Germany, Greece, Netherlands, New Zealand and Spain. (Country to country comparisons are slightly imperfect due to the variance in how data is reported. For example, the rate for Turkey and Switzerland is based on each country’s most recently reported year, which is 2006 and 2004, respectively. You can see more on this Google spreadsheet we compiled using U.N. data for firearm death rates from 2004 to 2010.) Post foreign affairs blogger Max Fisher concluded, ""The U.S. gun murder rate is about 20 times the average for all other countries on this chart. That means that Americans are 20 times as likely to be killed by a gun than is someone from another developed country."" A related fact-check from PolitiFact examined a 2011 study by researchers of the Harvard School of Public Health and UCLA School of Public Health. Their findings, while based on data for 23 high-income, populous countries from the World Health Organization now almost a decade old (2003), mirror more recent trends. The United States, they found, has more firearms per capita, the most permissive gun control laws and a disproportionate amount of firearm-related deaths from homicides, suicides and accidents. ""The United States had a homicide rate 6.9 times higher than those in the other high-income countries, driven by a ﬁrearm homicide rate that was 19.5 times higher than those in the other high-income countries,"" the report says. ""For 15 year olds to 24 year olds, the ﬁrearm homicide rate in the United States was 42.7 times higher than in the other countries."" Bloom said her particular statistic is widely reported, and she will include more stats on gun deaths in her upcoming book, Suspicion Nation. ""No matter how you analyze the data, the numbers are deeply disturbing,"" she said. Our ruling Bloom said, ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" Her phrasing is imperfect (""civilized"" countries versus ""developed""), and depending on what countries you count  you can reach a slightly different figure. But Bloom’s point is well-sourced and largely accurate. The United States has a much higher rate of the world’s most developed countries.

San Antonio water customers up 52%, but only used 21% more water 1986-2011
","San Antonio’s growth was coupled with an eye-popping statistic during the latest Texas Tribune Festival public policy conference. Robert Puente, CEO of the San Antonio Water System, said during a Sept. 20, 2013, panel discussion that the city-owned utility has seen ""67 percent growth in the last 25 years, 0 percent more water used."" San Antonio has been called a ""poster child"" for water conservation. As it has risen to become the seventh-largest city in the United States, its leadership has used multiple approaches to tackle the water worries facing all of Texas, where the population is rocketing and the future looks dry. But did 67 percent more customers settle in without using more water? By phone, Puente said the percentages he aired ""need to be updated."" The water system’s vice president for public affairs, Greg Flores, told us by email that Puente’s rates covered 1984 through 2009. During that period, according to a chart Flores sent us, the population served by the utility rose from 800,627 to 1.34 million while water produced fell from 191,431 acre-feet to 186,112 acre-feet (an acre-foot is the amount needed to cover an acre to a depth of 1 foot, equal to 325,851 gallons). That’s a nearly 68 percent increase in population served and a 2.9 percent decrease in water produced. Then again, the cited period wasn’t the latest 25-year time span when Puente spoke. Flores said the chart was generated from the utility’s 2008 statistics. Flores sent a web link to the most recent edition, the utility’s ""2011 Stat Book,"" and gave us the numbers for 2012, which we used to check the six most recent 25-year spans for which data is available. The 2012 data was not available when Puente spoke at the conference, Flores said, though data through 2011 was. ""Compilation of data for a particular year is typically not completed until the end of the following year,"" he said. The 25-year spans showed fluctuations partly explained by the weather: Flores noted that 2011 was ""the single hottest, driest year in Texas"" and said water use remained atypically high through the 2011-13 drought. 2007 was a very wet year for San Antonio, he said.
  25-year span Population served Acre-feet used 1987-2012* Up 55.2% Up 23.4% 1986-2011 Up 51.8% Up 21% 1985-2010 Up 55.6% Up 5% 1984-2009 Up 57.6% Down 0.6% 1983-2008 Up 59.9% Up 21.5% 1982-2007 Up 69.1% Down 7.3% *2012 data were unavailable when Puente made his claim. The oldest span we checked, 1982-2007, showed more dramatic change than Puente’s statement: 69 percent growth and a 7 percent drop in water use. But the most recent span for which data was available when he spoke, 1986-2011, saw a 52 percent increase in customers alongside a 21 percent increase in water used. That’s still not bad, a long-time Sierra Club leader told us by phone.  Ken Kramer, water resources chairman for Sierra’s Texas chapter, told us, ""It’s still very significant. Especially as compared to other major cities around the state. … It is great that San Antonio is doing this, and it does provide a model for other cities that haven’t had that success yet."" The trend statewide is toward less water use, Kramer said. State and federal standards, with such requirements as water-efficient showerheads and toilets, have reduced Texans’ per-person water use. Texas as a whole averaged out to about 151 gallons used per person per day in 2007-11, according to the Texas Water Development Board, with the state’s nearly 26 million people using 169 gallons apiece a day during hot, dry 2011. Flores said, and the utility’s stats confirm, that San Antonians reduced per-person water use from around 200 gallons a day in the 1980s (the utility’s stats show the decade averaged out at 197 gallons per day, to be precise) to about 140 gallons a day now (2007-11 average out at 137 gallons per day). Daily water use per capita for 2011 in Texas’ six largest cities shook out this way, according to the water board: Houston, 191 gallons; San Antonio, 148 gallons; Dallas, 197 gallons; Austin, 156 gallons; Fort Worth, 166 gallons; El Paso, 143 gallons. What got San Antonio saving? ""A big federal hammer,"" Puente told us. ""Back in the early 1990s, a federal judge actually was going to lay down pumping rules, limit our ability to pump water out of our aquifer, and gave us till the end of the legislative session to pass certain rules that we would impose on ourselves,"" he said. San Antonio and nearby areas, he said, were hit by the federal deadline because of endangered species that relied on the Edwards Aquifer. Flores outlined some of the Alamo City’s approaches: Smarter use of water pulled from the Edwards, including the nation’s largest direct recycled water delivery system, routing treated wastewater to users such as golf courses, the River Walk and local industry. Pumping all the Edwards water it’s allowed to every year, and storing what it doesn’t use in the Carrizo Aquifer -- which isn’t porous like the Edwards, but hard-packed sand, Flores said. The Edwards water sits there, in fact barely commingling with the Carrizo water, and San Antonio has been extracting it as needed for the past three years.       New sources such as a $145 million desalination plant set to start tapping a deeper, saltwater aquifer in 2016. Not pumping as much water in the first place, aka conservation. The water utility educates users and subsidizes ways to use less, both in residential and commercial systems. Flores said the utility has approved conservation projects based on the $400 price to buy rights to an acre-foot of Edwards water for a year. If the project was cheaper than buying the water, the utility implemented the plan. Giving away 325,000 low-flow toilets, even hiring plumbers to help low-income residents install them, cost less than the unsaved water would have, Flores said. Same for helping Coca-Cola retool to clean bottles with pressurized air. Last year, though, mindful of the rising cost of water from the Edwards and other sources, the utility raised the ceiling: Now a project has to save more than buying the water at $1,100 per acre-foot, he said. Outdoor water usage, Puente said, is the next area of focus, with the utility offering rebates to water customers who want to convert a parched part of their lawn to a deck or patio. Our ruling Puente said San Antonio has seen ""67 percent growth in the last 25 years, 0 percent more water used."" Those are cherry-picked, out-of-date stats, vintage 1984-2009. Up-to-date figures available when Puente spoke, covering 1986-2011, show that as the population served grew 52 percent, water usage increased 21 percent. San Antonio may outpace other cities in water conservation. This claim still washes out as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Rhode Island Senate says the New England Patriots ranked second this season in the most points scored in the NFL
","There are plenty of reasons for praising the New England Patriots, a team vying for a Super Bowl berth Sunday when they take on the Denver Broncos. But the Rhode Island Senate may have gone just a bit out of bounds on Jan. 15 when, without dissent, it passed a resolution lauding the team for its accomplishments and wishing them well against the Broncos. The resolution, sponsored by Paul Jabour, D-Providence, and Roger Picard, D-Woonsocket, states that, ""The Patriots were led by an explosive offense that scored the second most points in the NFL and a tough and stingy defense."" The resolution was read aloud. We won't get into the debate over how tough and stingy New England's defense is, especially during recent games. But the point total claim raised the hackles of one of our sports gurus, who said the Senate had made a rookie mistake. When another reader started raising questions about the Senate resolution on Twitter, we went to the official statistics page at NFL.com. According to the site, New England scored 444 points during the regular season. That put the team in third place, one point behind the Chicago Bears (with 445 points) and the Broncos (with a whopping 606). Third place isn't second place, so the claim seems to be False. But the resolution doesn't specify regular season. If you include postseason play, which purists are loath to do when comparing all the teams in the NFL, New England does rank second. (The Bears didn't make the playoffs.) By that measure, the resolution is correct. Denver has logged 630 points, New England 487 points, and Kansas City 474 points. (If you want to look at the postseason alone, New England ranks fifth out of 12 teams on point totals. San Francisco and San Diego have scored more points, but each team has played two games, while the Patriots have played just one.) In sum, the claim can be accurate, but only if you combine regular-season and postseason play, which means comparing teams that competed in 16 games with those that have played 17 games (or in a few cases, 18 games). That's a sizable caveat. Because the statement needs clarification or additional information to be correct, we rate it Mostly True.

Scott claims secrecy in picking judicial nominees
","It’s said the wheels of justice move slowly. So, too, is the process of approving the names of some judicial nominees. The tortoise-like pace of appointing judges to serve on two key courts has resulted in rare public criticism of the Obama administration by some leading Georgia Democrats and civil rights leaders. One such critic is U.S. Rep. David Scott, a Democrat who represents portions of metro Atlanta. ""It is an abomination that these nominees for lifetime appointment were drafted in secret, not vetted by any legal groups among the president’s supporters,"" Scott wrote in a letter to U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee. Scott and others, who’ve supported President Barack Obama on so many issues, felt blindsided by the White House, particularly since the nominees were reportedly chosen after consultation with Georgia’s two Republican senators. We wondered if the congressman’s claim was correct. U.S. District Court Judge Julie Carnes was the White House’s pick to serve on the Atlanta-based 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, joining pending 11th Circuit nominee Jill Pryor, an Atlanta attorney. To fill four Northern District of Georgia slots, Obama nominated Atlanta attorney Leigh Martin May, DeKalb County State Court Judge Eleanor Ross, Georgia Court of Appeals Judge Michael Boggs and Atlanta attorney Mark Cohen. The critics say there’s not enough racial diversity among the nominees. They say some nominees have previously sided against the interests of the civil rights community. The Senate confirms presidential nominees, and the White House reportedly had trouble getting some names past the two senators for nomination. ""I don’t think (Obama) will nominate anyone without home-state senator support,"" said Richmond College of Law professor Carl Tobias, who studies the judicial nomination process and has paid close attention to what’s going on in Georgia. U.S. Sens. Johnny Isakson and Saxby Chambliss had held up Obama nominees for years, until a deal struck several months ago finally broke the impasse, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution has reported. A spokeswoman for Chambliss declined comment, referring us to a December statement by both senators thanking the White House for its cooperation through the nomination process. The White House press office and Isakson did not respond to requests for comment. Scott’s chief of staff, Michael Andel, explained that the White House did not discuss the nominations with Georgia Democrats serving in Congress, which is why the congressman described the process as secret. Andel said the White House did not run the names by organizations that typically vet potential nominees, such as the Georgia Association of Black Women Attorneys (GABWA) or the Gate City Bar Association, a prominent African-American attorney group based in Atlanta. Veteran Atlanta attorney and former six-term congressman George ""Buddy"" Darden chaired a 13-member committee in 2009 that was created by Georgia Democrats in Congress to submit nominees to Obama to the federal bench. The committee took input from GABWA and other groups, he said. A year later, the AJC reported that none of the vacancies had been filled. Why not? Chambliss and Isakson weren’t thrilled with the names being submitted, according to news accounts. In 2013, after Obama’s re-election, Darden said the White House rebuffed their efforts for a meeting. The White House worked with the two Georgia senators and Kenneth S. Canfield, a major Obama donor and Atlanta attorney, according to Darden and some news accounts. ""(The White House) wouldn’t let the congressmen know what was happening,"" said Darden, who served in Congress as a Democrat. Canfield declined comment. Charles S. Johnson III, a former president of the Gate City Bar Association, gave us a detailed account of negotiations with the Obama administration. Negotiators met with the White House in mid-2010, he said, and the Obama administration made two nominations to fill vacancies on the North Georgia court. Chambliss and Isakson, though, did not support the candidates, Johnson said. In August 2013, when rumors surfaced that a deal was in the works, the Gate City Bar Association and other groups wrote Obama to complain they were being left out, said Johnson, a partner at Holland & Knight, one of the most influential law firms in Georgia. The White House met with some Georgia Democrats serving in Congress in October. Andel said names of specific judicial nominees weren’t discussed at the meeting. Johnson said his group and others tried, to no avail, to get a meeting with Chambliss and Isakson. ""There was no public process for vetting these nominations before they were announced, unlike previous years, in which the president and the senators typically sought input on judicial nominees from leaders and organizations in the community to be affected,"" Johnson said via email. ""I personally met with one of the individuals who was rumored to be part of brokering this package deal. In my meeting I specifically asked whether it would be possible to seek community input regarding this package. I was told that there was no interest in seeking community input, and that those involved in putting this deal together were aware that the deal would draw significant community opposition."" Sarah Binder, a senior fellow at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution, said the White House has no formal process when it comes to judicial nominations. Some states, she said, have commissions to vet candidates. Most will seek input from the state’s U.S. senators. Tobias said he thinks Scott’s claim is correct, but he agreed the spoils of victory for U.S. senators include having input on judicial nominations. ""It’s not the best way to proceed, but it may be the only way to proceed,"" Tobias said. To sum up, Congressman Scott claimed he and other Georgia Democrats serving in Congress were left in the dark when the White House came up with the names of nominees to serve on two key benches. He also claimed groups who traditionally support Obama weren’t in the loop as well. This was tough to fact-check because some key people and groups involved in the process wouldn’t talk about it. But it appears Scott and the other Democrats weren’t consulted when the White House came up with its nominees. While some groups weren’t consulted, it does appear some Obama supporters did offer some input.

Checking Robert Gates' criticism of Vice President Joe Biden's foreign policy record
","A new memoir from former Defense Secretary Robert Gates hit the book shelves this month, drawing both praise and criticism for its candid insights into the two most recent presidents Gates worked for, George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and their administrations. Washington reporters immediately latched on to Gates’ portrayal of Vice President Joe Biden. Biden, he said, is a nice guy — ""simply impossible not to like"" — but ""wrong on nearly every major foreign policy and national security issue over the past four decades."" Ouch.  Asked to back up his harsh words Jan. 13, 2014, on National Public Radio’s Morning Edition, Gates replied: ""Frankly, I believe it. The vice president, when he was a senator — a very new senator — voted against the aid package for South Vietnam, and that was part of the deal when we pulled out of South Vietnam to try and help them survive. He said that when the Shah fell in Iran in 1979 that that was a step forward for progress toward human rights in Iran. He opposed virtually every element of President Reagan's defense build-up. He voted against the B-1, the B-2, the MX and so on. He voted against the first Gulf War. So on a number of these major issues, I just frankly, over a long period of time, felt that he had been wrong."" This is not an argument without consequence. Biden served for years on the Foreign Relations Committee, including several stints as chairman, and he was picked as Obama’s running mate in part because of his experience in world affairs. For someone of Gates’ stature to publicly criticize a sitting vice president is uncommon. We can’t — and won’t — weigh in on whether Biden was on the right or wrong side of history. That’s a debate that likely will never end. Nor are we stipulating that Gates’ examples are the definitive list by which the last 40 years of U.S. foreign relations will be judged. But we did wonder if Gates’ description of Biden’s history was accurate. That led us to this review of the career of a man who first entered the Senate in 1973 and who twice has acted on his presidential ambitions and may again in 2016. History between Biden and Gates Biden won his first election in 1972 at just 29, fueled by the anti-war sentiments of a generation wary of the Vietnam conflict. Biden later said he ""wasn’t against the war for moral reasons; I just thought it was stupid policy."" At other times in his career, Biden advocated for military intervention. Most notably, Biden was an early and instrumental advocate of military intervention in the Serbia and Kosovo conflicts during the Clinton administration. He reportedly called Yugoslavian leader Slobodan Milosevic ""a damn war criminal"" to his face and later said his work in the Balkans was one of his two ""proudest moments in public life."" Biden and Gates have not always disagreed. In his memoir Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War, Gates recalled fighting military leaders in 2007 to get more money to protect troops on the ground against roadmines. It was Biden who offered an amendment to fund Mine Resistant Ambush Protected vehicles to the tune of $1.5 billion. It passed unanimously. But there’s clearly tension between Gates and Biden. Gates wrote that just sitting next to Biden was ""awkward"" because they so frequently were at odds. Biden is mentioned on nearly six dozen pages of Gates’ 600-page memoir, often in an unflattering light. Biden, too, has not always been so kind to Gates. When President George H.W. Bush nominated Gates to director of the Central Intelligence Agency in 1991, Biden not only voted against his confirmation, he openly criticized Gates. ""I believe it is time for us to look forward. I have been disappointed in the past in Mr. Gates’ analytical skills, especially in regard to the Soviet Union,"" Biden said, according to the Senate record. ""I have chosen to err on the side of new thinking."" A few minutes later, Gates won confirmation by a vote of 64-31. When Gates was confirmed overwhelmingly by the Senate 95-2 to Secretary of Defense under the second Bush, Biden was one of three senators not to vote. Clearly, these two men have some history. But what about Gates’ claims regarding Biden’s record? Let’s go through them one by one. Biden ""voted against the aid package for South Vietnam."" On April 10, 1975, President Gerald Ford requested Congress to provide nearly $1 billion in military and humanitarian aid to South Vietnam within nine days. By this point, American intervention in Vietnam was waning after two decades of involvement, and Ford’s request was the final attempt to bring U.S. assistance to the war-torn country. On April 25, 1975, the Senate approved a conference report to provide some financial assistance on a 46-17 vote. Biden, just two years after taking office, voted against the measure. The bill ultimately died in the House. And on April 29, as the South Vietnam capital of Saigon was captured, Ford order an evacuation of all remaining U.S. personnel from Indochina. Biden said when ""the Shah fell in Iran in … 1979 ... that that was a step forward for progress toward human rights in Iran."" We were not able to find evidence that Biden spoke positively of the fall of the Shah.   Mohammad Reza Shah Pahlavi was the leader of Iran until January 1979, when he and his family were forced out of the country by backers of Ruhollah Mostafavi Musavi Khomeini, an exiled cleric critical of the regime. Khomeini returned to the country in February 1979 to claim power as supreme leader and proclaim the Islamic Republic of Iran, the state it remains in today. An extensive search through newspaper archives found no instances of Biden speaking positively of the Shah’s ouster. Jules Witcover, author of Joe Biden: A Life of Trial and Redemption, does not recall coming across such a statement in his research, either. We found reference to the statement in a 2008 opinion piece published by the New York Post that heavily criticized Obama’s choice of Biden as his VP. But there was no source for it. The comment has continued to circulate in conservative media, again without citation. We contacted both the Post and the author to ask for a source, but we didn’t hear back. Through a publicist, we asked Gates to back up the claim. They simply referred us back to his book. We found no other source for this statement, and especially no original citation, so we have significant doubts that it’s accurate. We will update this point if more evidence comes to light. Biden ""opposed virtually every element of President Reagan's defense build-up. He voted against the B-1, the B-2, the MX and so on."" Following World War II, the United States’ approach to the Soviet Union and the spread of communism centered on containment. President Ronald Reagan changed that, said Barry Watts, a senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, a national security think tank. ""If you read through key national security documents written under Reagan, they basically turn their back on containment and say, ‘we can win this thing,’"" Watts said. ""And the defense build-up under Reagan is the concrete substantiation to put increased pressure on (the Soviets)."" During the next eight years, Reagan would push Congress to spend hundreds of billions of dollars on defense. One such proposal was to bring back the B-1 bomber, a plane canceled under President Jimmy Carter. On Dec. 3, 1981, Biden voted for an amendment to eliminate funds for the B-1 from the defense appropriation bill. The amendment failed, and the defense spending bill passed the Senate a day later with $2.4 billion for the B-1. Biden did not vote on the Senate bill. The same bill also contained $2 billion for the MX, an intercontinental ballistic missile known as the ""Peacekeeper."" Biden voted for an amendment that would have eliminated some funding for the MX, which failed. The B-2, also known as the ""Stealth bomber,"" was a secret project for much of the 1980s. Funding for the project was included in the 1987 defense spending bill, but the amount was classified. Biden voted for the final bill, but we could not find his position on that particular appropriation. However, from 1989 to 1992, Biden continually voted for measures that stripped funding from the B-2 project, according to voting record scorecards kept by the Council for a Livable World, a group that advocates for nuclear arms control. As for the rest of the defense build-up, Biden voted in favor of the final military spending compromise resolutions passed by Congress throughout the Reagan years, his office noted. But he also often voted against many of the administration’s military priorities during the amendment phase. Biden annually earned high ratings in the 1980s voting scorecards from the Council for a Livable World, which generally opposed Reagan’s defense build-up. The exception was in 1987 and 1988, when he earned low marks after missing many of the votes while running for president. Biden ""voted against the first Gulf War."" Biden was a staunch opponent of the first invasion of Iraq in 1991 under President George H.W. Bush. The day before the vote, he delivered a blistering speech against the war and accused Bush of threatening to usurp the constitution to commit troops without congressional consent. But Biden was not alone in his dissent. The House had its longest debate in the history of the chamber in deciding whether to go to war, according to the Los Angeles Times, and the Senate only narrowly passed the joint resolution authorizing use of force in Iraq, 52-47. Biden voted no, citing a torn Congress and country. ""Even if you win today, you still lose,"" Biden said on the day of the vote. ""The nation is divided on this issue."" Our ruling Gates’ assessments of Biden’s positions on South Vietnamese aid, the Reagan defense build-up and the first Gulf War are accurate, according to our research. However, we found no solid evidence that Biden actually said the fall of the Shah was a step forward for human rights in Iran. Experts will continue to debate whether foreign policy decisions of Gates and Biden will be viewed favorably by historians. But Gates portrayal of Biden’s record was accurate, with the exception of the unproven claim about Biden’s comments on Iran. We rate Gates’ statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/jan/16/robert-gates/robert-gates-criticism-vice-president-joe-biden/

Fox News host says Americans don't know their history, then flubs history of Boston Tea Party
","Fox News co-host Andrea Tantaros scolded Americans for not knowing their history on The Five on Wednesday. She inadvertently provided proof moments later, in the form of … Andrea Tantaros. Tantaros and other The Five panelists were talking about a new report from the conservative Heritage Foundation, which ranked America only 12th in terms of economic freedom. Tantaros said countries ahead of the United States, like Estonia, are more economically free because they ""actually know their history, and they study their history, and they study ours and what we’re doing here."" Americans, on the other hand, have gotten lazy and complacent, she suggested. ""If you ask most people, they don’t even know why we left England,"" she said. ""They don’t even know why some guy in Boston got his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea. Most people don’t know that."" We can’t fact-check what Americans do or do not know. But what’s clear is there appears to be no story of ""some guy in Boston"" getting ""his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea."" Early American history experts were generally puzzled over what Tantaros was talking about and thought she might have mashed a few Revolutionary War-era stories together. Neither Tantaros nor Fox News responded to our request for clarification. But our experts were certain on a couple of things: 1. No one secretly tried to raise the tax on tea. In 1767, The British parliament imposed a series of duties on goods being imported to the colonies -- including on tea. The laws implementing the tariffs are called the Townshend Acts, after Charles Townshend, who came up with the idea. Many prominent colonists objected, arguing that under British law colonists could not be taxed without having representation in parliament. All of the tariffs were repealed in 1770, except the tariff on tea. The 1773 Tea Act, which spawned the Boston Tea Party (and more than 200 years later was part of the inspiration for the tea party political movement), did not increase taxes on tea, said University of North Texas associate professor Guy Chet. What it did, essentially, was create a tax break for the British-held East India Company that would allow it to sell tea cheaper in America than anyone else (even cheaper than tea smuggled into the colonies). Colonists refused the ploy to prop up the East India Company and legitimize British colonial rule, and boarded the first tea ships in Boston and dumped the tea overboard. ""The Tea Act is routinely and understandably (but incorrectly) lumped in with these other other laws that did raise taxes,"" said Chet, author of Conquering the American Wilderness: The Triumph of European Warfare in Colonial New England. Point being: No secret, and no direct effort to increase the tax. 2. The man who tried to tax tea on colonists wasn’t in Boston when he died. If you had to identify one person as the tax on tea guy, it’d be Townshend, who was chancellor of the Exchequer. But he didn’t die in the colonies and certainly didn’t have his head blown off. Townshend barely lived past the passing of the Townshend Acts. He died Sept. 4, 1767, of a ""putrid fever."" ""I don't know what Tantaros is talking about. Sounds like bunk to me,"" said Benjamin L. Carp, an associate professor of early American history at Tufts University and author of Defiance of the Patriots: The Boston Tea Party and the Making of America. ""No one in British North America tried secretly to raise the tax on tea, much less get his head blown off for the attempt,"" said Samuel A. Forman, who blogs about revolutionary history and wrote Dr. Joseph Warren: The Boston Tea Party, Bunker Hill, and the Birth of American Liberty. 3. It’s hard to say who ""got his head blown off,"" if anyone. Forman speculated that Tantaros may have been talking about Joseph Warren, who was president of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress. Warren was killed at the early Revolutionary War battle of Bunker Hill on June 17, 1775. He was shot in the head, ""dying heroically at the climax of the battle,"" Forman said. (History buffs can watch a video of Forman describing Warren’s injuries.) Chet said Tantaro may have been referencing violence against British customs officers attempting to enforce existing taxes on tea. ""Just as a matter of ballistics, it'd be pretty difficult to blow someone's head off with 18th century weaponry unless you were using artillery,"" Carp said. ""Although maybe you could do the trick with small arms; you'd have to ask a weapons expert."" Our ruling Tantaros, in lamenting Americans’ knowledge of U.S. history, said, ""Some guy in Boston got his head blown off because he tried to secretly raise the tax on tea."" No one got their head blown off for that reason, and no one secretly tried to raise the tax on tea. The British government imposed duties on a number of goods in 1767, including tea. The 1773 Tea Act actually would have made tea cheaper for colonists, though it would have done so by propping up the British-held East India Company. The man responsible for the original tax died of a fever in Britain. Tantaros appeared to be trying to make the point that Americans -- who live in a country that is less economically free, according to one report -- forget what the lack of freedom feels like. That position may or may not be supported by their lack of knowledge of the lead-up to the Revolutionary War. But it’s not supported by her version of history because it did not happen.

Blog posts broke news that administration was delaying Obamacare’s employer mandate
","U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz sees a ""consistent pattern of lawlessness from this president and this administration""-- unilaterally altering laws and choosing which to enforce, Cruz said in Austin on Jan. 10, 2014. One example, the Texas Republican said, came last summer, when President Barack Obama delayed by a year the Obamacare law’s requirement that companies with 50 or more employees provide coverage to their workers. ""The president’s a big fan of saying, ‘It’s the law of the land. We need to follow the law of the land.’ Oh, really? Let’s see, that law of the land says on Jan. 1, 2014, the employer mandate shall kick in for big business,"" Cruz said at a Texas Public Policy Foundation conference. ""And yet the president just announced unilaterally, ‘No, we’re not enforcing this. I’m granting an exemption to all of big business.’ And by the way, this was done -- was this done through a big formal announcement, through an address to the American people: ‘There’s a problem in this law; we’re going to have to change it’? ""No. It was done through a blog post by a mid-level bureaucrat at the Department of Treasury on July 3, right before the Fourth of July break."" We’re not getting into whether laws were broken; not our purview. But we wondered if Cruz accurately captured how the change was revealed. Cruz spokesman Sean Rushton told us by email that Cruz was referring to a July 2, 2013, blog entry on Treasury.gov attributed to Mark Mazur, assistant secretary for tax policy. The post said, ""The administration is announcing that it will provide an additional year before the ACA mandatory employer and insurer reporting requirements begin."" News coverage that day said the Treasury and White House websites broke the news. The New York Times reported: In a significant setback for President Barack Obama's signature domestic initiative, the administration on Tuesday abruptly announced a one-year delay, until 2015, in his health care law's mandate that larger employers provide coverage for their workers or pay penalties. The decision postpones the effective date beyond next year's midterm elections. Employer groups welcomed the news of the concession, which followed complaints from businesses and was posted late in the day on the White House and Treasury websites while the president was flying home from Africa. The Washington Post’s Wonkblog said: The Obama administration will not penalize businesses that do not provide health insurance in 2014, the Treasury Department announced Tuesday. … ""We have heard concerns about the complexity of the requirements and the need for more time to implement them effectively,"" Mark Mazur, Assistant Secretary for Tax Policy, wrote in a late Tuesday blog post. In a July 3, 2013, news story, Bloomberg News described the White House website announcement: Valerie Jarrett, a senior Obama adviser, said in a blog post announcing the move that the administration decided on the delay so officials could simplify reporting requirements and give employers a chance to adjust their health-care coverage. Some months later, it looks to us like the Treasury announced the change shortly before the White House did. Jarrett’s post is time-stamped 6 p.m. Eastern; the Treasury blog entry does not have a time stamp. But the earliest news accounts we saw solely cited the Treasury post: the Washington Post news blog entry, stamped 5:51 p.m., a Business Insider news story stamped 5:41 p.m., and a Huffington Post item stamped 5:50 p.m. Eastern. With the announcements, the government put in motion one-year delays for businesses to report certain information to the IRS and related penalties. The Obamacare law, approved in 2010, essentially requires affected employers and other health coverage providers to report whether their insurance plans meet the law’s minimum coverage standards and whether employees are enrolled in them. There were more notification steps: A July 9, 2013, IRS notice formalized the change, and Treasury and the IRS published proposed versions of the rules for comment Sept. 9, 2013, in the Federal Register. When we called in January 2014, IRS spokesman Eric Smith told us by phone that the final rules had not yet been issued. Debate has swirled over whether the administration had the authority to unilaterally make this change. Rushton emailed us a link to a July 8, 2013, blog post by the libertarian Cato Institute saying the Affordable Care Act gives Treasury the authority to collect penalties, not to waive them or the reporting requirements. In contrast, a Treasury official told a House subcommittee on July 17, 2013, that the department generally may delay effective dates in some circumstances -- such as easing the transition to new requirements -- because of a law stating the IRS can ""prescribe all needful rules and regulations"" to enforce relevant laws. So: The news was announced on two government blogs. And was the originator a mid-level bureaucrat? John Palguta, vice president for policy at the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan group that studies the federal workforce, told us by email, ""The assistant secretary for tax policy is far from a mid-level Department of Treasury employee. ""Of the approximately 2.1 million civilian employees in the executive branch of government (not counting the Postal Service), Mr. Mazur is one of only 1,217 Senate-confirmed, political employees in government paid at executive-level IV,"" which in 2013 was $155,500 a year. On the other hand, a University of North Carolina constitutional law professor who wrote a book on federal appointments told us by email, ""He could be described as ‘mid-level’ but, because he is Senate-confirmed, not a bureaucrat.

Texas trails for fastest-growing state, but more than 1,000 people a day have still been moving there
","In a full-page advertisement in the Austin American-Statesman, Texans for Reliable Power suggested a need for more electricity generation in the state by presenting ""facts"" starting with: ""Texas is experiencing the fastest population growth in the country. As we add more than 1,000 people a day, each new Texan and new business increases demand on our grid."" Is Texas (still) growing that fast? In 2010, we rated as Mostly True a claim by Gov. Rick Perry that more than 1,000 people move to Texas every day. With help from the U.S. Census Bureau, we learned that about 635 people were then coming to Texas every day, on average. A census official based that number on average daily net migration from other states (393) plus average daily net migration from other countries (242). IRS data, meanwhile, suggested that about 1,353 a day switched their residence to Texas between the time they filed their tax returns in 2007 and when they filed in 2008. Eric Bearse, a spokesman for the group, which he described as organized by investor-owned power plants, said the ad's reference to Texas having the nation’s fastest population growth reflected raw changes in population, not percentage changes. That’s ""because it is the raw number of people that add demand to the (electrical) grid,"" Bearse said by email before pointing out web links to census population estimates for the states through June 2013 plus a Dec. 21, 2011, census press release indicating Texas was the nation’s fastest-growing state from April 2010 to July 2011. Before Bearse provided the group's back-up information, we had inquired about how fast Texas is growing to the Census Bureau and the Texas state demographer, Lloyd Potter. Potter drew on the bureau’s state population estimates as of the end of June 2012 and June 2013 to respond by email that Texas gained more than 1,000 residents a day, by those figures, and also gained the most residents of any state. However, Potter and bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein, also replying by email, each told us that Texas has not had the fastest growth rate. Specifically, Texas led the nation by gaining 387,397 residents from July 2012 through June 2013. California, ranking second, saw a population bump of 332,643, according to the bureau estimates. Yet North Dakota, whose population increased by 22,000 residents,  experienced the greatest percentage growth, 3.1 percent, trailed by Utah (about a 46,000 person increase, 1.6 percent). Next among the states, Colorado and Texas each saw increases of 1.5 percent, according to the estimates. Potter and Bernstein each said that the estimated increase in the population of Texas in 2012-13 means the state gained an average of 1,061 residents a day over the 12 months. Our ruling The group said: ""Texas is experiencing the fastest population growth in the country,"" adding ""more than 1,000 people a day."" From July 2012 through June 2013, the state’s population increased more than 1,000 people a day, according to government estimates. In raw numbers, Texas also added more new residents than any other state. But the state’s 1.5 percent growth rate trailed the gains of North Dakota and Utah, tying the pace of growth of Colorado. North Dakota also grew faster than Texas from 2010 through June 2013, according to census bureau estimates. Texas ranks among the fastest-growing states; it’s not quite No. 1.

Scott Walker plans to end income tax, more than double sales tax, Democrat Mary Burke says
","As her gubernatorial campaign was getting its sea legs, Mary Burke knocked Gov. Scott Walker for curtailing collective bargaining for most public employees, spurning federal money to expand Medicaid and failing to create jobs as quickly as he promised. With the turning of the calendar, Burke’s scope widened and her rhetoric sharpened. When WisPolitics asked her about the state income tax in a Jan. 7, 2014 interview, the Madison Democrat immediately invoked Walker, alleging he has a two-pronged plan that would raise taxes. ""Walker's tax plan is a tax hike,"" Burke claimed. ""It increases taxes for nearly 80 percent of the people in the state and we shouldn't think about it being anything other than a tax hike that falls on those who are least able to afford it. Eighty percent of the people in the state would pay more money."" She added: ""It's going to kill jobs. If you can imagine a hike from 5-1/2 to 13-1/2 percent  in sales tax, every single business along any of our borders should be deeply concerned. People would leave and just drive across the border, buy their goods there. You think about a person who's thinking about buying a new car. That's an extra $1,000 or more on top of that price."" Let’s slow down a bit. As Walker eyes the November 2014 gubernatorial election and a possible presidential run in 2016, he has said he is aims to continue cutting taxes. Yet, raising the state portion of the sales tax to 13.5 percent would make it the highest in the nation. So is Walker pushing a plan that would more than double the state sales tax, resulting in 80 percent of residents paying more in taxes overall? Income tax The income tax question to Burke followed comments Walker made about tax reform during at least four media interviews in December 2013 and January 2014. Let’s start with Walker’s comments, to see whether he has a plan to shift from the income tax to the sales tax. 1. In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Walker opened the door to a host of potential tax overhauls in his February 2015 state budget proposal (assuming he is re-elected). Those ranged from eliminating or flattening the income tax to dropping technical colleges from local property tax rolls. Walker said those changes could involve both outright cuts, and shifts of income or property taxes onto the sales tax. But he said he wouldn’t commit to any plan until after consulting with business leaders and the public. ""I don't have any preconceived notion on this. It's not like I have one goal,"" the governor said. ""The only goal is I want the overall tax burden to go down every year I'm in office. … What we're trying to do is have these early discussions that aren't threatening."" 2. Asked by a Wausau TV station if it’s possible to eliminate the state income tax, Walker said his administration will ask residents ""well into 2014"" if they prefer to continue ""chipping away"" at various taxes or taking bold action. ""If you look across the country -- some of the top performers, when it comes to job creation in the states -- are states that either have no income tax or very low income taxes,"" he said. ""I’m intrigued by that; I think there’s a lot of merit to that. But what I want to hear back from taxpayers is, is that the right way to go?"" Walker added:  ""As part of that -- a year out, spending the time really listening before acting -- is if we think removing income taxes entirely is the right way to go, how do we replace that? ""We don’t have a specific plan on the table."" 3. Walker made similar comments on Wisconsin Public Television, saying any formal plan to eliminate the state income tax, if one is developed, would not be proposed until late 2014 for the the 2015-'17 state budget. 4. And Walker told Wisconsin Public Radio that if the income tax were reduced or eliminated -- which he stressed is only an idea -- he would consider exemptions so that consumers wouldn’t have to pay sales taxes on essential goods such as clothing. ""It would protect people who have the lowest incomes the most if you could carve out those basic essentials out there,"" Walker said. ""And then, say, you want to spend more on things that may not be essential to your life and your livelihood, well then the sales tax is going to be a part of it."" When we asked the Burke campaign to back Burke's claim, spokesman Joe Zepecki argued that ""Walker is poised to pursue this policy change"" given that he has been considering the elimination of the income tax for nearly a year. Zepecki cited comments made by one of Walker’s top aides, Secretary of Administration Mike Huebsch, in a news report in February 2013. Huebsch said at the time that raising the sales tax to about 13 percent would allow the state to eliminate the income tax, and that Walker was considering eliminating the income tax. But the news report said nothing of any plan. So, Walker has expressed interest in the idea of eliminating the income tax and acknowledged that such a move would require recovering at least some of that revenue by raising the state sales tax. But he has said repeatedly it’s a concept he wants to discuss with the public for at least a period of months before any plan is considered. And he has said it is important to ""protect people who have the lowest incomes"" if any change were to go forward. Burke, however, framed the issue as if there is a specific plan on the table to eliminate the income tax entirely, and then took it a step further by asserting that plan would more than double the sales tax. Sales tax The second part of Burke’s claim is that Walker’s plan would raise the state portion of the sales tax from 5.5 percent to 13.5 percent. Moreover, she says that would result in nearly 80 percent of residents paying higher net taxes. To be sure, there is no specific plan. But let’s dig a little deeper on the numbers. Burke cites a blog post from the Wisconsin Budget Project, a program of the liberal Wisconsin Council on Children and Families. The post says that raising the sales tax to 13.5 percent -- in order to recover all revenue lost by eliminating the income tax -- would mean the bottom 80 percent of taxpayers, in terms of income, would pay more net taxes. (The nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau also says the state sales tax would have to go to nearly 13.5 percent in order to collect all revenue lost by eliminating the state's income tax.) For example, a taxpayer in the lowest 20 percent by income ($14,000) would pay nearly $750 more in taxes on average, according to the blog post. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent (average income exceeding $1 million) would receive a tax cut averaging nearly $44,000. The blog post ended by saying: ""There’s a lot we don’t know yet about what the governor plans for the income tax. But one thing is clear: repealing the income tax would mean that all but the wealthiest taxpayers would be paying more in taxes, not less."" The Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance notes that the wealthy pay disproportionately more of the state income tax and the poor spend more of their earnings than the wealthy do. That means high-income earners typically fare much better than the poor when the income tax is lowered and the sales tax is raised. So, mathematically speaking, revenue from the state income tax is equal to the revenue that would be collected by raising the state sales tax to roughly 13.5 percent. But Walker hasn’t proposed raising the sales tax to that level. And when he has talked about a shift in the state’s tax system, he has noted that exemptions on necessities such as food and clothing could be included to ease the impact of a higher sales tax on low-income residents. Beyond that, we can’t evaluate the fiscal impact of a plan that is not on the table -- yet that is precisely what Burke does in her claim. This claim reminds us of one we recently rated from Walker himself, in which the governor touted a tax relief bill by using a hypothetical scenario and cherry-picked numbers. We rated that claim Pants on Fire. Our rating Burke said Walker's income ""tax plan is a tax hike. It increases taxes for nearly 80 percent of the people in the state."" Walker wants to explore the possibility of eliminating the state income tax, which likely would trigger some increase in the state sales tax. But he has not advanced a plan to eliminate the income tax, nor to raise the sales tax by any particular amount. For a statement that is false and ridiculous, we give Burke a Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2014/jan/16/mary-burke/scott-walker-plans-end-income-tax-more-double-sale/
"['Energy', 'Florida', 'Maurice Ferre']","
Maurice Ferre warns of China's rise as an alternative energy leader
","
On June 1, 2010, Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, Maurice Ferre, dropped by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel newsroom and met with the editorial board. Among other things, he talked about a new economic development policy based on moving the country away from dependence on oil.

Near the end of the 7:12-minute-long clip posted on YouTube, Ferre weighs in on the need for the United States to pursue renewable energy sources. He also laments our standing in the world in the renewables sector: ""I think it is unacceptable for the Chinese today to be larger in wind power and in solar panels and photovoltaic manufacturing than all of Europe put together—forget the United States.""

In other words, Ferre, a former mayor of Miami, is bothered that China has emerged in recent years as a global leader in the manufacturing of windmills, solar panels, and other off-the-grid gadgets, and Europe and the United States are left in the dust. We wondered whether he's right about China’s dominance and how far ahead it really is.

We asked Ferre where his numbers came from, and he said he read it in The Economist recently though he didn't have specifics. We tracked down a Feb. 3 article in the monthly magazine. Titled ""Blown Away: China and America added most wind capacity in 2009,"" the article was about how America's ""reign could be short-lived as China continues its enormous rate of increase"" in wind capacity. Bear in mind, though, this was about the amount of energy produced by wind technology in China, not about wind-turbine manufacturing.

Similarly, the nonprofits we found that study global renewable energy focus mainly on the production and energy capacity of a country -- and not so much its manufacturing. In other words, they don't concentrate solely on the building of wind turbines and solar panels.

We contacted Worldwatch Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank that issued an 80-page ""Global Status Report"" on renewable energy earlier this year. Ferre is indeed correct when he notes the rise of China as it becomes a competitive force in the renewable energy sector.

""Manufacturing leadership is shifting from Europe to Asia as countries like China, India, and South Korea continue to increase their commitments to renewable energy,"" opens the report. ""In 2009, China produced 40 percent of the world's solar [photovoltaic] supply, 30 percent of the world's wind turbines (up from 10 percent in 2007), and 77 percent of the world's solar hot water collectors.""

The report offers a breakdown of the market shares of the top 10 wind turbine manufacturers for 2009, and the market shares for the top 15 solar photovoltaic, or PV, manufacturers, for 2009. (Photovoltaic manufacturers make solar cells, usually out of silicon, that convert the sun's light into electricity. Solar cells are what's inside the solar panels we're familiar with.) Among wind turbine manufacturers, China holds 21 percent of the market, compared to Europe's 38 percent. India, the United States, and ""others"" make up 39 percent. It must be noted that both lists don't take into account the remaining firms.

Among market shares for the top 15 solar PV manufacturers, China came out on top, according to the Worldwatch Institute report, with 23 percent, compared to Europe's 5 percent and the United States' 14 percent.

""It's been the manufacturing leader in photovoltaic modules for at least a couple of years, and long ago took the lead in solar water heating components,"" wrote Seth Masia, deputy editor of SOLAR TODAY, a magazine affiliated with the nonprofit American Solar Energy Society.

Indeed, China's ascent as a photovoltaic manufacturer is consistent with what we found elsewhere. Once dominating as the world's largest PV manufacturer (in the 1980s), the United States has since lost its footing. In 2008, the U.S. produced only 5 percent of the world's solar cells, with Europe and Asia leading global production, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. The European Photovoltaic Industry Association reports that in 2009 China manufactured 54 percent of the world’s silicon module capacity, compared to 28 percent for Europe and 5 percent for the US.

It would have been so much easier for PolitiFact to check on the production of energy rather than equipment, and China does have a good story to tell in energy capacity. China added more renewable-power capacity than any other country in the world in 2009, according to the Worldwatch Institute.

But Ferre's point was manufacturing when he met with the Sun-Sentinel editorial board. His statement that China is larger than Europe and the United States in the manufacturing of wind and solar power equipment is correct for photovoltaics, but not for wind. The Worldwatch Insitute report points out that, among the world’s top 15 wind turbine manufacturers, Europe came out ahead of China in 2009. That gives Ferre's statement a rating of Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/23/maurice-ferre/ferre-half-true-chinas-rise-energy-leader/

Sheriff in McCain campaign ad claims more than half of illegal immigrants come through Arizona
","
One of the points of contention over Arizona's tough new immigration law is the number of illegal immigrants pouring into the state. And it's an issue Sen. John McCain, who was a leader in the bipartisan efforts for immigration reform in 2007, has taken up in campaign ads.

""Drug and human smuggling, home invasions, murder,"" says McCain as he walks along the border fence in Nogales, Ariz., with Pinal County Sheriff Paul Babeu.

""We're outmanned,"" says Babeu, matching McCain's slow pace, hands together behind his back, in an ad known as ""Complete the danged fence"" that was posted to YouTube on May 7, 2010. ""Of all the illegals in America, more than half come through Arizona.""

That number seemed high to us, so we decided to check it out. Because the claim was made in an ad produced by the McCain campaign rather than Babeu himself, we are attributing it to the McCain campaign.

We found the numbers were different than the ad claimed.

It is true that about 45 percent of immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally most likely cross through Arizona, according to statistics on apprehension rates published by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. Apprehension rates appear to be closely correlated to actual rates of entry, according to Jeff Passel, senior demographer with the Pew Hispanic Center.

However, not all illegal immigrants enter the country illegally.

The Pew Hispanic Center estimates that 40 to 50 percent of all people residing illegally in the U.S. actually entered the country legally, according to a report cited in congressional testimony by John Morton, assistant secretary of homeland security for U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. For example, they came as tourists or on a temporary visa, and then overstayed their visit.

A 2005 report published by the Migration Policy Institute estimated that 30 to 40 percent of people with visas stay longer than they are permitted.

""Only slightly more than half (of all illegal immigrants) sneak into the country,"" said Passel, adding that the data on those who enter legally shows that ""very few come through Arizona.""

So the McCain ad overreaches by saying that ""more than half"" of the illegal immigrants come through Arizona. While it is true that 45 percent of the immigrants who enter the U.S. illegally come through the state, the total number of illegal immigrants in the U.S. also includes the ""overstayers,"" so the percentage coming through Arizona ends up being lower.

We couldn't find a precise estimate on the percentage of illegal immigrants who crossed through Arizona, but estimates indicate it's much lower than the figure cited in McCain's ad. For example, if you assume 50 percent of the current illegal immigrants in this country entered illegally, then only 22.5 percent crossed through Arizona. Even if you assume that 70 percent entered the country illegally, a high estimate, then only 31.5 percent entered through Arizona.

The McCain ad would have been right if it said, ""Of all the people who enter this country illegally, nearly half come through Arizona."" But the claim as worded is pretty far off. We rate it Barely True.

Rachel Maddow and Marco Rubio come out swinging on claims about tax cuts and the federal deficit
","Liberal MSNBC television host Rachel Maddow and conservative Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio are engaging in a multimedia tit-for-tat over tax cuts and the federal deficit.

All set to a background of peppy elevator music, winks and clever one-liners.

We're not kidding.

The back and forth started on July 14, 2010, when Maddow decided to poke fun at Rubio's ""12 Simple Ways To Grow Our Economy."" She noted, correctly, that most of the ideas are ripped straight from the Republican playbook.

Extend the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts. Repeal the estate tax. Repeal the federal health care legislation. Fight cap and trade.

Maddow criticized the ideas as failing to consider the GOP's (and Rubio's) other golden rule -- thou shall not increase the deficit.

""Republicans want to be the anti-deficit and anti-debt party right now, but they also want to run on George Bush's tax policies,"" Maddow said. ""And that is the giant awkwardness at the heart of Republicanism right now. Because George W. Bush's tax policies did to the deficit what the 'I only eat fried cheese' diet does to your cholesterol.""

The Maddow rant got a reaction from the Rubio campaign two days later, in a web ad set to that peppy elevator music we talked about.

""On Tuesday, Marco Rubio announced 12 simple ways to grow the economy and create jobs,"" the ad, called ""Maddow"" begins. ""How can you know the plan is right? Rachel Maddow thinks it's wrong.""

(You really should watch these ads, by the way. Rubio at one point facetiously plugs Maddow's 9 p.m. show; Maddow, in return, facetiously thanks him, and so on).

On July 19, Maddow issued her reply to Rubio's ad -- in her own ""ad"" that mimics Rubio's.

""Marco Rubio has proposals for cutting the deficit and growing the economy. He wants to: Make Bush's '01 and '03 tax cuts permanent, end the estate tax, prevent cap-and-trade energy legislation, repeal health reform,"" Maddow's ad says. ""How does Marco Rubio say you can know his plan is right? 'Rachel Maddow thinks it's wrong.' Seriously. That's his argument. That's it.

""Even if everything about me is inherently wrong just by virtue of who I am, this is still true about Marco Rubio: His economic proposals will add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit.""

The Rubio camp issued their latest response on July 21, highlighting the state's unemployment rate and the number of Floridians facing foreclosure while taking a shot a President Barack Obama and Senate rival independent Gov. Charlie Crist.

""Think Obama and Crist's policies are working just fine for Florida?"" the ad, called ""Again, Rachel"" asks.

For Rubio, the ads are a chance to take on a liberal media-type like Maddow. And we're pretty sure we haven't seen the last of it. That said, we found it an appropriate time to jump in with a fact check. The question we're after: Will Rubio's economic ideas add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit?

Maddow's case We know government spending is a big issue for Rubio. On July 16, 2010, we checked and found True a Rubio claim that $0.40 of every $1 being spent by the federal government is now borrowed. We also know Rubio vigorously opposed the federal stimulus bill because it added substantially to the federal deficit. A spokeswoman for Maddow said the talk show host got her deficit figures from the Congressional Budget Office, Congress' nonpartisan number-crunching arm. The CBO produced a series of revenues estimates in February should Congress enact three Republican-held tax cutting ideas -- extend the set to expire 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, repeal the federal estate tax and continue indexing the Alternative Minimum Tax for inflation (The AMT was enacted in 1969 to make sure wealthy people couldn't avoid taxes altogether, but it wasn't indexed for inflation. Congress manually adjusts the AMT for inflation each year).

All three proposals are part of Rubio's 12 ideas -- specifically Ideas 1, 3 and 5.

Together, the CBO found that they would increase the federal deficit by $3.4 trillion from 2011-2020, ""mostly from lower revenues but also from increased outlays for refundable tax credits."" Preventing cap and trade legislation, Rubio's Idea 9, also would have a negative effect on the federal deficit, according to the CBO. The theory behind cap-and-trade is that the government sets a limit on how much carbon different companies, such as electric utilities or manufacturers, can emit (the cap). The government then issues permits to companies and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed so they can conduct business (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively.

In a letter dated July 7, 2010, CBO Director Douglas W. Elmendorf said that opposing cap and trade legislation would have the effect of raising the federal deficit by about $19 billion from 2011-2020.

Those are the four major ideas Maddow uses in making her claim. But we wanted to at least consider Rubio's other ideas. Many of them, it turns out, come with deficit impacts that are difficult to measure, or at least appear to have no impact on the deficit. Rubio proposes reducing the corporate tax rate, for instance, but he doesn't say how much -- making it impossible to judge the revenue impact.

Another Rubio idea is to repeal the federal health care bill (you can see all 12 here). The federal health care bill enacted is estimated to reduce the deficit slightly -- about $143 billion from 2010-2019 -- according to the CBO. But a substitute health care bill -- something Rubio favors -- could reduce the deficit as much. So we've decided to discount the deficit reduction for the sake of this fact check.

Excluding the health care repeal, that's about $3.4 trillion that we can verify that will be added to the federal deficit between now and 2020 if Rubio's economic ideas are put in place.

Economic debate

We turned to economists and Rubio's campaign to see what we're missing.

Karen Campbell, a policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the CBO deficit projections do not account for a fundamental Republican philosophy -- that lower taxes can bolster economic activity across a broader spectrum. Put simply, the lower tax rates are, or the less taxes people are required to pay, the more opportunities that exist for people to make money.

It's a sentiment echoed by the Rubio campaign.

""A growing economy means more people are employed and generating revenue, more businesses are being started and expanded, and fewer people are claiming unemployment benefits,"" Rubio spokesman Alex Burgos said.

That's not an argument for everyone, however.

""If you cut taxes, you borrow money, that's it,"" said Chuck Marr, the Director of Federal Tax Policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ""For a lot of Republicans it's gotten to the point, that deficits only concern spending. A deficit is when you spend more than you tax. But for them, it's become just what the spending is. They seem to think that taxes don't matter. Mathematically it's ridiculous.""

Added Gary Burtless, a senior fellow at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution: ""I cannot see any way that extending the Bush tax cuts or repealing the estate tax could have any effect other than to produce an increase in the expected size of the future deficit. Period. There is no plausible set of private economic responses that would generate an increase in future total tax revenue if those two policies were adopted. The federal government would simply collect less income tax revenue and less estate tax revenue than it is now expected to do.""

Greg Mankiw, who was the chairman of George W. Bush's Council of Economic Advisors from 2003 to 2005, estimated in 2005 that a broad-based income tax cut would recoup ""only about a quarter of the lost revenue through supply-side growth effects.""

Mankiw, who teaches macroeconomics at Harvard, referred to people who believe that broad-based income tax cuts could actually raise tax revenue ""charlatans and cranks"" in the first edition of his textbook, Principles of Economics.

Our ruling

We realize we're not going to be able to change people's basic economic philosophies. We're not here today trying to disprove supply-side economics, or boost another economic thought. Based on our analysis, we do think it's a stretch for someone like Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to suggest the Bush 2001 and 2003 tax cuts were revenue neutral. And yet we also see the logic in the argument that lower taxes could stimulate investment in the economy, creating an army of new taxpayers. Rubio, himself, realizes spending cuts also will be necessary to offset at least some of the tax cuts he's proposed -- and to shrink the federal deficit. Rubio's campaign announced he would roll out ideas to cut government spending on July 26 in Jacksonville.

And we'll be ready to examine them. But in this case, we're sticking to Maddow's claim that Rubio's ""economic proposals will add $3.5 trillion to the federal deficit."" The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office says that extending the 2001 and 2003 Bush tax cuts, repealing the estate tax and continuing to adjust the Alternative Minimum Tax for inflation will increase the federal deficit $3.4 trillion between now and 2020.

That's right about on the mark, and only measures the impact of three of Rubio's tax cutting ideas. But unlike Maddow, we do want to leave some leeway for the economic growth those broad-based tax reforms could generate, as well as Rubio's spending cuts, still to be revealed.

John Boehner, GOP claims that federal taxpayers will fund Pennsylvania abortions simply untrue
","
As Congress struggled to pass health reforms earlier this year, anti-abortion groups and members of Congress fretted the legislation would permit taxpayer dollars to be used for the controversial procedure, overturning years of precedent that banned use of federal money for abortions except in cases of rape, incest, or to save a mother’s life. To ease those fears, President Obama signed an executive order that reaffirmed the bans would continue in health insurance programs developed under the new bill.

Obama’s gesture was needed to win support from key anti-abortion Democrats, including Bart Stupak of Michigan, Marcy Kaptur of Toledo and Steve Driehaus of Cincinnati. But Republicans still weren’t convinced. ""Make no mistake, a ‘yes' vote on the Democrats' health care bill is a vote for taxpayer-funded abortions,"" House GOP Leader John Boehner of Ohio said at the time.

As states prepare to implement a part of the law that encourages them to create temporary high risk plans for people with pre-existing medical conditions who have trouble finding affordable insurance, Republicans like Boehner and anti-abortion groups like the National Right to Life Committee are claiming the new high risk insurance pools will provide a backdoor way for the federal government to fund abortions. Pennsylvania was among the first states to put together a plan, and publicize its details.

""The Department of Health & Human Services is providing $160 million to the state of Pennsylvania to set up a new high-risk insurance pool program that would cover any abortion legal in the state,"" Boehner said in a news release July 13.

""This is the boldest admission yet from the Obama administration that the President’s Executive Order on taxpayer-funded abortion was a sham,"" Boehner said. ""The fact that the high-risk pool insurance program in Pennsylvania will use federal taxpayer dollars to fund abortions is unconscionable.""

Ohio’s eight GOP members of Congress have kept up the chorus.

On July 15, Rep. Jim Jordan of Urbana claimed the Pennsylvania high-risk insurance program would include abortion coverage and demonstrate that Kaptur, Driehaus and Obama violated their promise that ""ObamaCare would not allow tax dollars to be used to take the life of unborn children.""

""The Stupak-Kaptur-Driehaus executive order, signed by President Obama was not worth the paper it was printed on,"" Jordan’s statement said. ""It was merely a ploy to give so-called pro-life Democrats an excuse to vote for a federal takeover of health care that allows taxpayer funding of abortion..""

Then on July 19 the group of eight – Boehner, Jordan, Steve LaTourette of Bainbridge Township, Patrick Tiberi of Genoa Township, Jean Schmidt of Loveland, Michael Turner of Centerville, Bob Latta of Bowling Green and Steve Austria of Beavercreek – wrote to Gov. Ted Strickland expressing concern that other states’ high risk health plans will cover elective abortions, and urging Strickland to make sure that doesn’t happen in Ohio.

""Your voice as Governor is needed to help ensure that not a dime of the $152 million in federal funds Ohio is set to receive for its high-risk pool plan goes toward covering abortions,"" their letter said. At Strickland’s request, Ohio Department of Insurance Director Mary Jo Hudson replied with a letter that insisted the high risk pool the state plans to launch on Aug. 1 will comply with federal law, and not cover abortion services ""except in the cases of rape or incest, or where the life of the woman would be endangered.""

Will these new plans actually permit individuals with pre-existing medical conditions to get federally funded abortions?

Boehner’s statement is nearly identical to one made by the National Right to Life Committee that we analyzed. They said that the Obama administration will give Pennsylvania $160 million to pay for health insurance plans that cover ""any legal abortion.""

Here’s what we found when we analyzed that statement July 16.

Pennsylvania’s 60-page proposal outlines a standard health care plan that says this about abortion: ""Includes only abortions and contraceptives that satisfy the requirements of 18 Pa.C.S. § 3204-3206 and 35 P.S. §§10101, 10103-10105. ... Elective abortions are not covered.""

Those statute numbers refer to Pennsylvania's abortion laws, where abortion is, for the most part, legal. The code says that abortions may be performed if a doctor determines that ""in his best clinical judgment, the abortion is necessary."" The only mention the statute makes of forbidding an abortion is when it is ""sought solely because of the sex of the unborn child.""

Douglas Johnson, National Right to Life Committee’s legislative director, said those statute numbers mean that the proposal is meant to include any legal abortion.

""We know how this stuff works,"" Johnson said. ""He'll say 'It's not elective, it's necessary.'""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services responded in a statement issued July 14: ""In Pennsylvania and in all other states abortions will not be covered in the Pre-existing Condition Insurance Plan (PCIP) except in the cases of rape or incest, or where the life of the woman would be endangered.""

Pennsylvania’s insurance department, issued its own statement July 15: ""Pennsylvania will – and has always intended to – comply with the federal ban on abortion funding in the coverage provided through our federally funded high risk pool. This program will provide much-needed assistance for the sickest of the sick. The likelihood that any of those covered will seek abortion services is remote, but if they do need such services, they will have to pay for them out their own pocket.""

The Department of Health and Human Services is still developing regulations for many aspects of health care, and they're trying to do it with some haste. New Mexico, for example, submitted a plan for the Pre-existing Condition Health Insurance Plan that explicitly included abortion services, but then withdrew it quickly when it learned that the federal government would forbid the services, Associated Press reported.

The Obama administration has clearly stated it won’t allow abortion to be covered under the new plans, save for cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother. State officials in Pennsylvania and Ohio have insisted their new programs will comply with the federal ban. The high-risk plans in question are designed to cover older people with chronic health conditions rather than the healthy young women most likely to seek elective abortions.

We find Boehner’s statement to be False.

Ted Strickland claims Ohio invested more in school funding
","
Gov. Ted Strickland has long campaigned on being a champion of education, even going so far as to inject himself into the landmark school funding decision in Ohio back when he was a congressman.

So it’s no surprise that the Democratic governor is peppering  his campaign speeches with references to increasing school funding.

For example, in a July 6, 2010, speech in Columbus, Strickland lamented funding cuts done in several other states before saying ""in Ohio, we invested in our children, raising school funding by 5.5 percent in the last budget.""

The claim is such a popular theme with Strickland, we decided to look more closely at his assertion.

While it’s true that the total pot of money going to funding primary and secondary schools in Ohio will grow by 5.5 percent during the current two-year state budget that ends in July 2011, it’s not state aid that is responsible for the hike. State aid to schools will actually be lower by about $32 million--from $6.542 billion in 2009 to $6.510 billion in 2011. On a district-by-district level, that means about 60 percent of the more than 600 school districts in Ohio will get less money for operations in the current two-year budget cycle than they did before.

Instead, it’s federal money, including stimulus funding dollars which makes the statewide school funding pie bigger. And a large portion of the federal funding for primary and secondary education must be funneled into very specific programs such as $922 million statewide in combined federal Title I and IDEA funding. Title I money must be spent on things like additional teachers, intervention specialists for low-income students. IDEA funds must be spent on the education of special needs children.

The natural impression left by the governor’s words ""we invested in our children, increasing school funding"" is that Ohio’s state government took steps to increase the amount it puts toward education. In fact, it was the federal government that has invested more in Ohio’s children. And six out of 10 Ohio schools districts have less money to spend on operations than they did in the previous budget under Strickland.

We find the governor’s claim to be False.

American Crossroads ad attacking Reid on stimulus uses out-of-date data
","
One of the most closely watched U.S. Senate races of the year is the match-up between Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev. Reid, the Senate's most powerful member, faces Republican Sharron Angle, a Tea Party favorite.

In mid-July, American Crossroads -- a group that's the brainchild of top Republican officials including Karl Rove and Ed Gillespie, both former strategists for President George W. Bush -- released one of the latest in a string of hard-hitting ads in the race.

The ad said, ""It's bad enough that Nevada has the highest unemployment in the nation. And Harry Reid claims to be helping the jobs situation. Really Harry? Recent data showed Nevada ranks 50th in the money received from Harry's stimulus bill. Thats right. Senate Leader Harry Reid has gotten his own state less help than every other state but one. Along with bailouts, deficits and Obama care, that's what Harry Reid's done for Nevada. Really, Harry? That's not the kind of help Nevada needs.""

We thought it would be worth checking to see whether Nevada really ranks 50th in aid from President Barack Obama's economic stimulus bill.

Tracking down the source of the claim was easy: The ad includes an on-air citation of a Las Vegas Review-Journal story. But we sat bolt upright when we saw the story's date: Feb. 23, 2009. No, not Feb. 23, 2010. The ad said Feb. 23, 2009. That's less than two weeks after Congress passed the massive bill -- not exactly ""recent"" in our view.
 
Seeking more details, we looked at the story itself. It's a comprehensive article by staff reporter Molly Ball that outlined how Nevada ranked in per capita stimulus aid overall (50th of 51, counting the District of Columbia), as well as for education (51st), transportation (48th), and Medicaid assistance (47th).

Because we couldn't find any official document on the Internet that confirmed Nevada's 50th-place rating, we contacted Ball. She said that she calculated the numbers herself using data provided to her at the time. The article cites numerous sources, including the Nevada State Budget Office, the Congressional Research Service, the journalistic outfit ProPublica, the Democratic Policy Committee and CNNMoney.com. It also explains that a large part of the reason why Nevada was poised to receive comparatively little funding was that federal dollars from the stimulus are pegged in part to what the state already pays for programs such as Medicaid, which are low compared to many other states.

The rankings attracted attention at the time. A March 1, 2009, column in the Review-Journal's competitor, the Las Vegas Sun, picked up on the raw-deal-on-the-stimulus theme and quoted a spokesman for Republican Gov. Jim Gibbons saying, ""The governor was surprised and a little disappointed we didn’t receive more in the stimulus package for the state.""

So we can understand why American Crossroads used these figures. But was it appropriate to describe them as ""recent""? We don't think so.

The Obama Administration has made significant efforts to collect and publicize data on where stimulus dollars are going through the website Recovery.gov, run by a congressionally created board independent of the administration. (The Recovery Board collects the data from recipients via FederalReporting.gov,) So we turned to Recovery.gov for the most up-to-date data.

There's a state-by-state breakdown that lists ""funds available,"" which is defined as ""funds set aside for release to a recipient either immediately or in the future."" Through July 15, 2010 -- 17 months more recent than the article cited in the ad -- almost $3.2 billion had been set aside for Nevada, about double the amount calculated by the Review-Journal in early 2009. To make an apples-to-apples comparison to the figure cited in the ad, we calculated stimulus funds per capita, by dividing every state's dollar total by its population. Using this measurement, Nevada actually ranked almost exactly in the middle of all states -- 26th from the top.

There's also a breakdown for ""funds paid out"" to date. Using this measurement, Nevada has received $2.2 billion, which is even better -- Nevada ranks 16th highest nationally, or well above average.

When we asked American Crossroads for comment, spokesman Jonathan Collegio said that it's legitimate to fault Reid based on the original Review-Journal statistics, which reflected the bill immediately after it left his chamber. ""When the Senate Majority leader brags about all the power and the prestige he brings Nevada, while not actually getting anything for Nevada in the stimulus bill he controlled, he has neglected his home state,"" Collegio said.

We'll grant that there are a lot of different ways to make this kind of calculation. An ongoing study by ProPublica, an investigative journalism outlet that has tracked stimulus data, found that Nevada ranks 9th from the bottom, using data that is several months older (and possibly different from) than what is found on recovery.gov. Even recovery.gov offers various types of data that can be sliced and diced to produce state rankings. So the authors of the ad had no shortage of data to choose from.

It's not surprising that American Crossroads would reach for the most unflattering number, and if they'd framed it carefully -- for instance, saying that the state ranked 50th ""in one study"" -- they would have scored passably on our Truth-O-Meter. However, American Crossroads not only cherry-picked the most damning data but also tried to pass it off as ""recent."" Current data would have showed that Nevada's stimulus haul was no smaller than about average by national standards. This is not a trivial omission, so we rate the ad False.",/factchecks/2010/jul/23/american-crossroads/american-crossroads-ad-attacking-reid-stimulus-use/

GOP candidate for governor Karen Handel calls opponent Nathan Deal a ""former Clinton Demcrat.""
","
Republican candidate for governor Karen Handel emerged this week from the smoke of the primary election battle guns blazing.

The morning after winning a spot in the Republican runoff, the former Georgia secretary of state appeared on WSB-TV and called her opponent, former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal of Gainesville, a name: ""a former Clinton Democrat.""  

Former Democrat? Yes. But was Deal a big supporter of Clinton?

Handel rose in the polls as a possible front-runner only weeks before Tuesday's primary, where she captured 33 percent of the vote. Deal trailed her by 10 points.

The two will face off Aug. 10 to see which Republican will go head to head in November against the Democratic nominee, former Gov. Roy Barnes.

Handel went on the attack just hours after her primary win, during a live, four-minute interview Wednesday morning. She was responding to a claim by Deal that he's the only ""true conservative.""

She laughed.

""You know, I’m not going to be lectured by Nathan Deal, who is a former Clinton Democrat. I will stack up my conservative credentials against his any day of the week,"" Handel told the WSB-TV anchor.

When Fox 5 asked her the same question, she renewed the charge.

First, a little history about Democrats in Georgia.

Deal served in the state Senate starting in 1981 as a conservative Democrat. Democrats dominated Southern politics at the time, and Georgia was no exception. Conservative Democrats were common.

With the start of the 1990s, conservative Democrats increasingly switched to the GOP. Deal followed.

Deal was a Democrat during his first congressional win in 1992, the year of Bill Clinton's first presidential victory. Deal won again as a Democrat in 1994. 

But in April 1995, after the GOP took control of the U.S. House and Senate during the Republican takeover, Deal switched parties and became a Republican. He has stuck with the GOP ever since.

Deal resigned from the U.S. House on March 21 to focus on his gubernatorial bid.

The Handel campaign gave four reasons why it thinks Deal deserves the ""former Clinton Democrat"" label. First is that he was elected to Congress as a Democrat when Clinton was at the top of the ticket. This is correct.

Handel's camp also brought up three pieces of legislation from 1993: two on the budget and a third on gays in the military.

The first had to do with a 1993 budget vote. Handel's team claims Deal's ""yes"" vote was for a tax increase. Deal's people said that vote was on a procedural issue, and Deal voted against Clinton’s tax hike during the vote that really mattered.

The second was Clinton's economic stimulus package. He supported a Republican amendment to the bill ""that would have forced Congress to offset any new spending with revenue increases or spending cuts,"" according to a news account. When it failed, Deal voted for the package.
The third was a bill that opposed Clinton's efforts to lift the ban on gays in the military. It would have amended a U.S. Department of Defense appropriations bill to require the military to ask people entering the armed forces whether they were homosexual or bisexual. Deal voted against it. 

When Deal served in Congress as a Democrat, he was by no means in lock step with Clinton -- even on the president's major initiatives.

Deal voted for legislation that called ending the ban on gays in the military an ""unacceptable risk."" Clinton settled for instituting the ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"" policy, which remains in place.

Deal voted against Clinton's successful push for a family-leave bill guaranteeing millions of workers 12 weeks of unpaid leave to deal with family emergencies.

""The purpose of the bill is noble, but I don't think it's the kind of thing the federal government should force on employers,"" he said at the time.

When Clinton proposed $10 billion in budget cuts in 1993, Deal said they were ""not really enough."" He was described in an October 1993 account in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution as ""a key member"" of a bipartisan group that pushed him to cut more.

Overall, Deal's voting record showed that Deal -- once he switched to the GOP -- was more of a Bush Republican than he was a Clinton Democrat while he was in Clinton's party.
 
In 1993, Deal voted in support of Clinton-backed bills 59 percent of the time, according to an analysis of voting patterns by Congressional Quarterly. In 1994, his support stood at 64 percent.
Deal's support for the president plummeted to 23 percent when he became a Republican. It  hovered in the midteens during Clinton's final three years, then shot up to 93 percent when Bush took office in 2001.

In 1998, Deal voted to impeach Clinton.

GovTrack.us, a group that tracks Congress, rates Deal as a ""rank and file Republican,"" based on his record of bill sponsorship.

In addition, political experts we interviewed were uncomfortable with describing Deal as a ""former Clinton Democrat.""

Charles Bullock, an expert on Southern politics with the University of Georgia, said he ""probably wouldn't"" use that term to describe Deal. Conservative Democrats generally came down to the right of a lot of Clinton's first-term agenda, especially on gays in the military.

Although Handel's campaign listed Deal's votes accurately, its take on his record while he was a Democrat ignores critical facts. Deal broke with Clinton to side with Republicans on a variety of legislation, including bills that were important parts of the president's agenda.

Furthermore, when Deal became a Republican, the bipartisanship evident during his career as a Democrat all but vanished. He voted enthusiastically against the president, including during Clinton's impeachment. Deal was no pal to Clinton.

We rate Handel's statement Barely True.

Stephen Colbert says that Texas can't afford new science textbooks because of an $18 billion budget shortfall
","
Rocker Alice Cooper famously sang ""school's out for summer,"" and on the July 6 episode of The Colbert Report, host Stephen Colbert saluted the ""noted educator,"" but amended the lyric. ""Depending on budget cuts, it could be out forever,"" he said. 
We won't take him too literally, since he also said that the Texas State Board of Education revised the state's social studies curriculum standards ""so the books would no longer say that Sen. (Joseph) McCarthy was engaged in a witch hunt, but, instead, was the star of Bewitched."" 
Still, another claim caught our ear: ""It turns out that Texas has an $18 billion budget shortfall and can't afford its new science textbooks,"" he said, as a May 18 Austin American-Statesman article flashed on the screen. 
Since Colbert has his ""I's on Edjukashun,"" a segment on his show about education news nationwide, we wondered whether he got that write. Er, right. 
When we contacted Colbert to elaborate, a spokeswoman told us that the show was on vacation until July 26, so we forged ahead. 
First, let's look at the budget shortfall. 
In a May 11 meeting of the House Appropriations committee, Wayne Pulver, assistant director of the Legislative Budget Board, told legislators the reasons the state is facing a budget gap. The board, which prepares a draft of the budget bill for legislators each session, also crunches the numbers that inform legislative spending decisions. 
At the hearing, Pulver confirmed that lawmakers will start the next legislative session with a budget gap because of funds that will no longer be available from sizeable sources that helped balance the 2010-11 budget: $6.4 billion in federal stimulus money and $5.6 billion in one-time state funds. 
Those figures jibe with an analysis the budget board produced in March for the committee. John O'Brien, the board's executive director, pegged the budget gap at $11 billion, but cautioned that his figure assumed no growth in state spending or revenue. 
At the May hearing, Pulver detailed factors expected to increase the shortfall, including that revenue could fail to meet projections and that spending may increase to accommodate growth in demand for programs like Medicaid and the Children's Health Insurance Program. 
When committee chairman Jim Pitts, R-Waxahachie, asked whether ""that could add up to between $15 and $18 billion,"" Pulver called the range ""reasonable."" 
Of course, projections are uncertain. In April, Sen. Steve Ogden, R-Bryan, chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, told the San Antonio-Express News in April that the budget gap couldn't yet be defined ""because you don't know — when you say shortfall, you imply some sort of mandatory spending level and some sort of predetermined revenue level, neither of which we have. There's no shortfall if you don't spend it. And we don't know yet what our revenue projections are."" 
How about them textbooks? 
On May 21, the education board voted to postpone issuing textbook Proclamation 2012, which calls for the purchase of new science textbooks for kindergarten through 12th grade, according to the Texas Education Agency. The science books were estimated to cost $347 million, in addition to $888 million necessary to cover already-approved English materials, continuing contracts and freight. 
""The state's looming budget deficit, estimated to be $18 billion in the next biennium,"" pushed the board's decision, according to TEA, and members instead decided to update the current textbooks with supplemental online material that covers the new science curriculum standards the board approved last year for science classes in fifth through eighth grade, plus biology, chemistry, physics and integrated physics and chemistry. 
What did we learn? 
Colbert cherry-picked the higher figure of the budget board's latest shortfall projection — $18 billion — but so did the education agency in explaining the education board's decision to delay buying new science textbooks. 
We rate his statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/23/stephen-colbert/stephen-colbert-says-texas-cant-afford-new-science/
"['Rhode Island', 'Legal Issues', 'Jeremy Kapstein']","
Kapstein says lieutenant governor has power to negotiate on economic development
","
Here we go again. Another election year, another debate over what the lieutenant governor's job is all about and whether it's even worth having the position at all.

The characters might change, but the story stays the same. The sitting lieutenant governors try to defend their work. The challengers promise they'd do more with the office, or in the case of Cool Moose candidate Robert Healey, eliminate it altogether.

Enter one of the newest candidates for the job, Red Sox senior adviser Jeremy Kapstein. When appearing on WPRO's Dan Yorke Show Tuesday, Kapstein, a Democrat, promised that, if elected, he'd be a salesman for the state, wooing developers and creating jobs in the process.

But it was what he said about the lieutenant governor's responsibilities that caught our ear:

""The lieutenant governor has the power to go out as an independent constitutional office and has the budget to be this economic ambassador. And then, when the deal is brought in, to actually negotiate and help the [state Economic Development Corporation] so that it is a good deal for the taxpayers of the state.""

That sounded like quite a lot of authority for an office that some have argued shouldn't even exist.

Kapstein's claim has created a minor stir among Rhode Island politicos, so we elected to send it to the Truth-O-Meter. What we really wanted to know is whether the state Constitution gives a lieutenant governor any authority to be an ""economic ambassador"" who could negotiate on behalf of the EDC.

Here's what we found: Apart from references to how and when the lieutenant governor is elected, there are few mentions of this job in the Constitution. Statutes within the state's General Laws note that the lieutenant governor is responsible for chairing several boards and commissions. But the Constitution does not lay out a specific set of duties that the state's number-two executive can, or must, perform.

It wasn't always that way. It used to be that the lieutenant governor was authorized to take over when the governor was out of state. But that power was stripped in a 1992 constitutional amendment. Until 2003, lieutenant governors were also responsible for presiding over the state Senate. These days, however, the most significant constitutional duty assigned to the lieutenant governor is as the governor's understudy:

""When the governor elect shall die, remove from the state, refuse to serve, become insane, or be otherwise incapacitated, the lieutenant governor elect shall be qualified as governor at the beginning of the term for which the governor was elected.""

We admit, we were intrigued by the question of who would determine that a governor had gone insane. But we digress.
 
Kapstein campaign manager Joe Rodgers said the candidate acknowledges the ambassador and negotiator roles are not specifically defined in the state Constitution, but Rodgers said Kapstein believes an effective lieutenant governor would take on those types of duties.

All this raises some interesting questions about Kapstein's claim. On the one hand, because the Constitution gives the lieutenant governor no specific powers, he's wrong to suggest that it does. But on the other hand, does the lack of specifics mean a lieutenant governor could do whatever he or she wants?

His Democratic primary opponent, incumbent Elizabeth Roberts, branded herself during her first term as a champion of health care and traveled across the state to encourage Rhode Islanders to ""Buy Local."" No one questioned her authority to do so.

The same goes for Kapstein's ability to negotiate on behalf of the Economic Development Corporation. There's nothing in the Constitution to say he can't do so, assuming the agency wants his help. The EDC board is chaired by the governor, which means Kapstein would need the governor's approval to take on any of this responsibility.

Roger Williams Law School Prof. Jared Goldstein said the absence of a defined job description makes it hard to determine what's appropriate.

""The question is whether the lieutenant governor on his or her own volition can just decide to take on various activities that are neither authorized by statute or by the Constitution,"" he said. ""Yet there's simply nothing in the Constitution or in statutes or in case law that speaks to that.""

So there we are, a little stuck. Kapstein's not completely right. But he's not really wrong either. As much as we hate to do it, we'll split the difference and call it Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/23/jeremy-kapstein/kapstein-says-lieutenant-governor-has-power-negoti/
"['National', 'History', 'Pundits', 'This Week - ABC News', 'George Will']","
George Will says Democrats in 1930s wanted FDR 'to be more conservative'
","During the July 18, 2010, roundtable segment of ABC's This Week, conservative columnist George Will turned to the 1930s in an effort to shed light on why Americans today are growing discouraged about the policies of a Democratic president.

""The false liberal assumption is that economic hard times move the country to the left,"" Will said by way of introduction. ""It's not true, and it didn't happen in the 1930s. Before the '36 election and after the '36 election, in which Roosevelt carried 46 of 48 states, Democrats said they wanted him to be more conservative, and only about 18 percent of Democrats said they wanted to increase spending. Those are Democrats.""

We weren't even aware that scientific public opinion polling existed in the 1930s, so we decided Will's claim that Democrats wanted Roosevelt to become more conservative was worth closer look.

We started by asking Will's staff for a citation. They said that he took his numbers from 1930s-era Gallup polls cited in The Right Nation: Conservative Power in America, a 2004 book by John Micklethwait and Adrian Wooldridge, journalists with The Economist. In turn, The Right Nation footnoted them to a 2003 book, The Strange Death of American Liberalism, by H.W. Brands. Researching in the main online archive for Gallup polls, we initially couldn't find the poll the books cited. But after conferring with Brands, we were able to locate it in an old bound volume. It was taken Nov. 29, 1936, and asked, ""Should President Roosevelt's second administration be more liberal, more conservative, or about the same as his first?"" Exactly 50 percent of Democratic respondents said ""more conservative,"" while 19 percent said ""more liberal"" and 31 percent said ""about the same."" So ""more conservative"" is not an overwhelming majority, but it's easily in the lead among the three choices. But there's more to the story.

To better understand the result, we turned to the largely forgotten world of 1930s polling. It turns out that Gallup began polling in 1935 using a method that's different from today's but fairly rigorous for its time.

Today, reputable pollsters use random sampling to choose phone numbers from across the country which they then call to ask standardized, carefully worded questions. The assumption is that a truly random sample will reproduce the whole nation in microcosm to within a few percentage points of accuracy (that's the familiar ""margin of error""). And while modern polling has its critics, most experts agree that it works pretty well.

By contrast, the earliest polls by Gallup first determined the demographic makeup of the electorate, then assigned survey-takers to visit far-flung locales in order to personally interview respondents with certain demographic characteristics. The idea was that surveying a population that has the same statistical characteristics as the whole electorate would produce a good sense of the voting public's opinion.

Polling experts we spoke to said that 1930s polling data has some value. But using it to prove a point requires caution, because 1930s polls are subject to certain types of statistical bias that today's polls have largely overcome.

The most obvious difference is that Gallup's 1930s polling was more akin to today's ""likely voter"" samples, rather than today's broader ""registered voter"" samples. Since Gallup set out to reach a demographic sample that mirrored those who voted, its poll-takers did not direct their questions to individuals who were deemed unlikely to vote. There's nothing necessarily wrong with this approach -- ""likely voter"" polls are a valuable part of the political landscape today. But it should be noted whenever raw data from 1930s polls are used, because polling likely voters in that era underrepresented women, southerners, blacks and the less-educated, according to Adam J. Berinsky, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology political scientist, in a landmark 2006 paper on 1930s polls.

Beyond sampling bias, there's another issue of concern: Was the poll Will cited representative of other Gallup polls taken around the same time? The answer is no. Eric Schickler, a political scientist at the University of California (Berkeley) tracked down a Gallup poll that was also taken in November 1936. One of the questions was, ""Should President Roosevelt's second administration be more liberal, more conservative, or about the same?"" Among the 1,378 Democrats interviewed, just over 50 percent -- a slender majority -- said ""about the same,"" while 30 percent said ""more conservative"" and 19 percent said ""more liberal.""

Meanwhile, Karlyn Bowman, a polling analyst at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank, found two other examples that undercut Will's claim. Gallup asked the following question in successive polls during November 1937, a year after Roosevelt's reelection: ""Do you think the policies of the Roosevelt Administration are too liberal, too conservative, or about right?"" In the first poll, 70 percent of Democrats said ""about right,"" 26 percent said ""too liberal"" and 4 percent said ""too conservative."" In the second poll, the numbers were similar, with ""about right"" rising to 74 percent. So, Democrats were once again likelier to say that FDR was too liberal than that he was too conservative, but both groups of respondents were far outnumbered by those who said FDR's approach was ""about right."" We'll grant that Will's introductory point -- that hard times in the 1930s didn't move the U.S. to the left -- has some merit. Several political scientists we talked to noted that public opinion tends to move in reaction to whoever the president is. ""When a Republican is elected President, opinion shifts in a liberal direction, responding to real or perceived conservative changes in policy, and when a Democrat gets elected, opinion moves conservative,"" said Robert Y. Shapiro, a Columbia University political scientist. So when FDR came in, Gallup polling showed indications that respondents were concerned about leftward drift. So let's sum up. The book sources Will used did report the poll result accurately. But there are two problems. One is that Gallup polls at the time under-reported the views of many Americans. The other is that at least three Gallup polls from that era showed that 50 to 70 percent of Democrats thought FDR's approach was ""about right,"" with much smaller proportions of Democrats seeking a more conservative FDR. So we rate Will's statement Half True.",/factchecks/2010/jul/22/george-will/george-will-says-democrats-1930s-wanted-fdr-be-mor/

Bloggers claim Bo flies in his own plane
","

Talk about making sacrifices and tightening the belt. Bo, the Portuguese water dog that Senator Ted Kennedy gave to the Obama family as a present, apparently flies in his own private jet. That, at least, is the claim that seems to have gone viral on the Internet over the weekend.

""As the rest of us toil on the unemployment line, as millions of Americans find their retirement accounts dwindling, their hours at work cut, and their pay scale trimmed, King Barack and Queen Michelle are flying their little doggie, Bo, on his own special jet airplane for his own little vacation adventure,"" wrote Warner Todd Houston, a blogger on Publius Forum.

The rumor caught our attention, and not just because we're fascinated with the pet air travel industry. Is Bo really commanding his own jet? We decided to look into it.

We quickly traced the origin of the rumors to the Morning Sentinel, a newspaper based in Waterville, Maine. On July 17, 2010, the paper published an account of the First Family's visit to the state's Acadia National Park. Among the details was a reference to Bo.

""Arriving in a small jet before the Obamas was the first dog, Bo, a Portuguese water dog given as a present by the late U.S. Sen Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., and the president's personal aide Reggie Love, who chatted with Baldacci,"" the article stated. It seems that some people took this to mean that Bo actually arrived in his own jet.

Air Force One is usually a Boeing 747, but the Trenton airport runway was too small for the plane, so the Obamas opted for a Gulfstream G3, the article stated. That plane can accommodate up to 19 passengers. To fit everyone in -- the President always travels with multiple staffers and aides -- the Obamas decided to travel in two smaller airplanes, the second of which carried several White House aides and Bo.

Indeed, the Sentinel article was updated to clarify that there were many other people in the jet that carried Bo. ""Today's story about the arrival of the Obamas said the Obamas' dog and one aide arrived on a small jet before the First Family, but there were other occupants on the plane, including several other staffers. The presidential party took two small jets to the Hancock County-Bar Harbor Airport in Trenton because the airport was too small to accommodate the president's usual jet."" 
To be thorough, we also checked with the White House. Katherine Bedingfield of the White House Office of Media Affairs told us that the claim is ""baseless and absurd."" Bo does not even require his own seat, and during the Maine trip he traveled on a government-owned plane with White House staff.

We figured that at least some of the bloggers were being satirical, but from our review of reader comments that followed many of the entries, it's pretty clear that there are those who actually took this stuff seriously, so we wanted to set the record straight.

So, Bo did indeed arrive in a separate jet, but it's ridiculous to claim that he has his own airplane. He traveled on a government-owned plane with government staffers who didn't fit in the small Gulfstream G3 that the First Family had to take because of the physical limitations of the Trenton airport runway.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Mike Pence']","
Mike Pence says Democrats want all of Bush tax cuts to expire
","In a July 20, 2010, press conference, Rep. Mike Pence, R-Ind., the third-ranking House Republican, attacked the Democratic majority over tax policy.

He said, ""The American people deserve to know that, should Democrats get their way, every income tax bracket will increase on January 1, 2011. Every single one. You know, you don’t raise taxes on every American taxpayer during the worst recession in 25 years. As we’ve done on their failed stimulus policy, as we did on their national energy tax, as we did on their government takeover of health care, House Republicans will stand in the gap to protect taxpayers from the largest tax increase in American history.""

We thought it would be worth checking two aspects of Pence's statement. One is whether all tax brackets are indeed poised to rise when tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush expire at the end of this year. The other is whether the Democrats actually want that to happen. We'll take these in order.

• Will every tax bracket increase? The answer is yes, unless Congress takes action.

The Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001, which is set to expire on Dec. 31, 2010, lowered income tax rates across the board, though studies have shown that the benefits of this law, when combined with other Bush-era tax cuts, tilted toward wealthier Americans.

The law created a new, 10 percent tax rate for the lowest-income taxpayers (many of whom actually qualify for tax rebates under the Earned Income Tax Credit). It also chopped a few percentage points off most existing tax brackets, with the top rate for married households falling from 39.6 percent to 35 percent.

If the tax cuts were to expire with no Congressional intervention, the pre-2001 tax brackets would spring back to life. Here's how the tax brackets would look on a before-and-after basis for married couples filing jointly based on their incomes. For simplicity, we're ignoring modest adjustments for inflation. Tax brackets for other categories such as individual filers broadly follow the same pattern.

  • Up to $16,750: Rises from 10 percent to 15 percent
  • From $16,751 to $58,200: Stays same at 15 percent, but entire bracket pays 5 percent additional on the first $16,750
  • From $58,201 to $68,000: Rises from 15 percent to 28 percent
  • From $68,001 to $137,300: Rises from 25 percent to 28 percent
  • From $137,301 to $209,250: Rises from 28 percent to 31 percent
  • From $209,251 to $373,650: Rises from 33 percent to 36 percent
  • $373,651 and up: Rises from 35 percent to 39.6 percent

   So on this point, Pence is correct, assuming Congress does nothing.

• Do Democrats want every tax bracket to rise, as Pence suggests? In a word, no.

For many months, Democratic officials have consistently said that they intend to let only the tax cuts for the wealthiest individuals lapse. The cutoff they usually suggest is $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for married couples filing jointly. President Obama campaigned on just such a plan, and we've logged those promises into our Obameter campaign promises database.

Take this Reuters article published July 13, 2010, just days before Pence made his comments.

""The U.S. Congress will likely act to extend tax cuts for the middle class to avoid choking off the fragile economic recovery, key congressional Democrats said on Tuesday. House Democratic Leader Steny Hoyer said he expected the House to push to extend middle-class tax cuts before they expire at year end but suggested cutting taxes for the wealthy is less urgent. 'What you want to do is stimulate at this point in time, so you certainly do not want to increase taxes on the middle class, middle-income working Americans,' Hoyer told reporters. President Barack Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress have vowed not to raise taxes on individuals earning less than $200,000 or couples making less than $250,000.""

A bill to do this is not yet finished, but spokesmen for both Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and the House Ways and Means Committee confirmed to PolitiFact that the legislative proposal they're working on would extend the tax cuts for all taxpayers below an income threshold. A Pence spokesman countered with another Hoyer remark, made June 22, 2010, during a forum on deficit reduction.

Hoyer told the audience that ""as the House and Senate debate what to do with the expiring Bush tax cuts in the coming weeks, we need to have a serious discussion about their implications for our fiscal outlook, including whether we can afford to permanently extend them before we have a real plan for long-term deficit reduction,"" according to an Associated Press report.

This suggests that at least one leading Democrat is undecided about how to proceed with the Bush tax cuts in the long term. However, we don’t see this as strong evidence for Pence’s claim.

First, Hoyer, in comments to reporters after the June 22 event, said, ""I don't think this is the time to increase taxes."" He said that any tax increases, if they happen at all, would need to take place after the economy recovers. He didn't express any opposition to temporary extensions of the tax cuts (at least for middle- and lower-income Americans) -- and that’s the only factor that’s relevant in judging Pence’s quote. While Pence would be on safe ground questioning Hoyer’s commitment to a permanent extension, he’s wrong to say that Hoyer would somehow ""get (his) way"" by seeing all tax brackets increase on Jan. 1, 2011.

Just to be safe, we checked with Hoyer’s office to nail down his stance on a temporary extension. Communications director Katie Grant confirmed that Hoyer favors at least a temporary extension to prevent a tax increase on Jan. 1, 2011. If anything, the momentum within the Democratic Party may be in the direction of keeping the Bush tax cuts for everyone, even for the wealthy. On July 22, 2010, news reports indicated that Democratic Sens. Ben Nelson of Nebraska and Kent Conrad of North Dakota had joined a growing chorus of Democrats who think it might be a good idea to extend the Bush tax cuts for everyone, at least until the economy has recovered. Pence is right that every tax bracket will go up if the law is not extended. Still, we think the claim that Democrats don't want to extend the law is inaccurate. While the legislative drafting is still in process, the Democratic majority in Congress has made clear that it plans to extend tax cuts for all but the top couple percentage points of the income distribution. So it's highly misleading for him to say that Democrats actually want to see all the bill's cuts expire. Indeed, Pence's comment verges on a scare tactic. While Pence would have been entirely accurate to say, ""If the Democrats fail to extend the expiring tax cuts, all tax brackets will increase,"" he didn't. What he did say merits a ruling of False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c0d67665-83ed-4917-9c62-18f8b2669155",/factchecks/2010/jul/22/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-democrats-want-all-bush-tax-cuts-e/

Group says more than 3 out of 10 girls have been pregnant at least once by 12th grade
","
Among the many dismal claims PolitiFact Georgia runs across, this one seemed more depressing than most. 

An e-mail newsletter sent by a membership group of state foster homes and other child services said that by 12th grade, ""more than 3 out of 10 girls have been pregnant at least once.""

Really? That much?

Normer Adams, executive director of the Georgia Association of Homes and Services for Children, is editor of Welfare Watch. The newsletter used the teen pregnancy statistic to illustrate the need for programs and praise the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Pregnancy Prevention's (G-CAPP) Second Chance Homes, where teen mothers live as they learn to be self-sufficient. 

Here's what the newsletter said:

""By the 12th grade, 63% of all students have had sex and more than 3 out of 10 girls have been pregnant at least once.""

This item deals with the pregnancy statistic. 

Adams said he got his information from the Web site of G-CAPP, which is a major statewide nonprofit that advocates to lower teen pregnancy rates.

G-CAPP's ""Fast Facts"" page gives a list of statistics on the state of teen pregnancy in Georgia and nationally.

""Three in ten girls in the U.S. become pregnant at least once before age 20,"" it states.

That's not by twelfth grade, but by age 20. So the newsletter didn't accurately cite the figure.

Still, ""three in ten"" in the U.S. seemed like a lot, so we called the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, a nonprofit that produces statistics and other information frequently used by teen pregnancy prevention groups. It's where G-CAPP got its figures.

The group calculated the pregnancy statistic itself, said Bill Albert, its chief program officer. An April 2008 fact sheet on the statistic said it was based on 2004 teen pregnancy rates from the National Center for Health Statistics, the most recent figures at the time. 

The usual teen pregnancy rate measures the rate of teen pregnancy in a single year. The figure from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy is different because it measures the ""cumulative risk of teen pregnancy over a teen girl's entire life up to age 20,"" according to its fact sheet.

The group totaled the teen pregnancy rate for girls in each of those 10 years, adjusting for teens who have multiple pregnancies. It found that 29.81 percent of girls become pregnant at least once as a teen, or three in 10.

To get an independent take on the subject, we contacted the Guttmacher Institute, a nonprofit group that performs social science research, policy analysis and public education on sexual and reproductive health in the U.S. and internationally. It checked data from the National Survey of Family Growth that was released last month. 

The survey, a sample of 15- to 44-year-olds across the nation, was conducted between 2006 and 2008 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Just under 28 percent of women who were age 20 at the time of the survey reported having ever been pregnant, according to the data. That's very close to 29.81 percent from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy. Or three in 10.

And for girls who are 18, the typical age for a 12th-grader, that figure was about 17 percent, according to that same set of data.

So why don't we notice more of these pregnant teens?

Albert from the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy said only about half of these teens give birth.

""Some may have hidden the pregnancies, some may have elected to terminate the pregnancy, others may have suffered a fetal loss,"" Albert said. ""In short, pregnancy is -- up to a point -- hard to detect. Children are not.""

So yes, three in 10 females in the U.S. become pregnant at least once by age 20.

This means that while Welfare Watch got the statistic from the G-CAPP Web site wrong, it's correct that a significant percentage of U.S. teens become pregnant. So while the statement is generally true, it was off-target on some important information.

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says that Texas has a high percentage of students who take the SAT
","
As CNBC pronounced Texas the nation's best state for doing business, Gov. Rick Perry offered reasons why Texas is ""still on top"" during an interview with the business-news network. One of them: the number of Texas students participating in a national college-admissions' exam. 
""We have more kids take the SAT than any other state in the nation,"" Perry said on the July 13 CNBC broadcast. ""I mean a high percentage of our kids take the SAT."" 
Which is it? 
Bill White, the Democratic nominee for governor who has stressed education as an important issue, thinks it's neither. ""Rick Perry proved again yesterday that he simply can't tell the truth when it comes to education,"" a July 14 press release from White chided, saying that Perry gave ""blatantly false information about SATs."" 
Later that day, the governor's office issued a press release pointing reporters to a July 14 Fortune magazine article that offered four reasons why ""Texas beats California in a recession."" However, the article also notes that ""SAT scores in the state have declined over the last few years, and the state ranked 34th among the 52 states and jurisdictions graded on the National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) last year."" 
Confused? 
When we checked with Perry's campaign, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier tweaked the first of Perry's CNBC statements by saying Texas has more students taking the SAT than ""nearly"" any other state. 
According to the College Board, which manages the SAT exams, Texas ranked third in 2009 in the number of SAT takers — 141,733 public and private school students. Of course, Texas was also the second-most populous state. California, the most populous state, had the most SAT participants (207,301), followed by New York (159,886). 
We turned next to Perry's second statement, that a high percentage of ""our kids"" take the SAT — arguably a powerful talking point because a state's percentage of SAT takers signifies its share of potential college students. 
According to the College Board in 2009, Texas had the 22nd highest SAT participation rate (21st if you don't count the District of Columbia): 51 percent of Texas students in the class of 2009. The national average was 46 percent. Maine had the highest participation rate (90 percent), followed by New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and D.C. 
In recent years, neither the percentage of SAT-takers in Texas nor the state's place in the College Board rankings has changed much. In 2008, Texas again came in 22nd, with 50 percent of students taking the test. In fact, as long as Perry has been governor, Texas has ranked 20th, 21st or 22nd. Its share of students taking the test has ranged from a high of 57 percent (2003) to, most recently, a low of 51 percent. 
So how does the governor's two-part statement score? 
We'll cut him slack for saying Texas has the most students taking the SAT, since he immediately backed off when questioned. And Texas did have the third-highest number of high-school students who took the SAT in 2009. 
Perry's statement that Texas has a high percentage of students taking the SAT begs the question: High compared to what? While the share of Texas students who took the test in 2009 exceeded the national average, 20 other states had greater shares of students taking the test including similarly high-population states such as Florida, Pennsylvania and New York. California had a smaller share: 49 percent. 
We figure ""high"" means better than barely above average. To stick with the school metaphor, 51 percent is a failing grade. 
We rate Perry's statement as Barely True. 
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.",/factchecks/2010/jul/22/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-has-high-percentage-students/

Alex Sink says House GOP rushed through pro-oil drilling measure, but stalled on oil ban
","
The July 20, 2010, special session to consider a constitutional amendment banning oil drilling in state-controlled waters was full of drama and political theatrics, but ultimately little action. 
The session came and went in about two hours with the Republican-controlled House and Senate failing to even consider adding anti-drilling language to the November ballot. The House voted along party lines 67-44 to adjourn the session without action. The Senate voted 18-16 to adjourn.

None of it, however, stopped political leaders from both major parties, and independent Gov. Charlie Crist, from trying to score political points.

Among the near-constant volleys of accusations, name-calling and bickering, we found a statement from Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink particularly interesting.

Speaking to reporters before the Legislature convened the noon session, Sink launched a pre-emptive attack against GOP legislators.

""Today at noon, I expect to see the culmination of the complete failure of the Florida Legislature to be in tune with what's going on the real world of Florida,"" said Sink, a Democrat who is running for governor. ""In the same chamber, where House Republicans shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling, those same Republicans will stand at their desks to claim they don't have enough time.""

During the 51 minutes of House debate before legislators adjourned, we heard from several Republicans about the need to deliberately and methodically consider the impacts of an oil drilling ban. House Speaker Larry Cretul, for instance, suggested the Legislature should consider whether to put a constitutional amendment on the ballot in 2012 -- in the calm after the crisis. 
""The fact remains that (Crist) has called us here at the last possible moment to consider a constitutional amendment for which he never proposed any language, and permitted far too little time for reflection and review,"" Cretul said. ""This is a terrible way to propose constitutional changes."" 
Was, as Sink suggested, that same line-of-thinking absent when legislators considered a proposal to allow drilling in state waters?

Sink spokeswoman Kyra Jennings pointed us to the House's oil drilling legislation in 2009 as proof.

That year, state Rep. Dean Cannon -- who is set to become Speaker -- filed a bill that would allow the governor and cabinet to award oil and natural gas leases in state waters between three and 10 miles offshore.

The bill passed the House 70-43 but stalled in the Senate.

From soup to nuts, how long did it take House legislators to consider and approve the measure?

The state keeps a thorough log that follows the progress of legislation. PolitiFact Florida went back to track HB 1219, the Cannon oil drilling bill.

The bill originally was filed on Feb. 26, 2009, but that's misleading. The original bill only asked the Department of Environmental Protection to develop a plan for the implementation of an oil and natural gas drilling program.

Cannon, of Winter Park, didn't unveil the final oil drilling language until April 20 (a Monday night), hours before it was scheduled to be considered by a House Policy Council. The Orlando Sentinel called Cannon's language a ""surprise,"" when it was introduced. The Pensacola News-Journal reported that it ""caught opponents off guard."" In an editorial, the St. Petersburg Times called the act a ""shameful"" oil drilling ploy.

The language, which was supported by oil drilling proponents such as the Associated Industries of Florida, passed out of the Policy Council 17-7. It was sent to the House floor the next day, a Wednesday.

From the Times editorial:

""Cannon sprang the radical idea to allow oil rigs within 3 miles of the coast in the eighth week of a nine-week legislative session. And he did it even as the House has failed to consider the governor's plan to foster renewable energy. Florida needs more than 10 days to consider changing a law that has protected its shores for decades, and the Senate and governor should reject it.

""Clearly, Associated Industries of Florida has been working with Cannon for weeks to try to reverse a 20-year drilling ban -- though Cannon unveiled it just 12 hours before it passed a House council Tuesday. A pollster hired to do a survey, an industry expert from Texas and an Orlando economist touting potential revenue all testified. Cannon contended HB 1219 is merely an attempt 'to have a mature, thoughtful conversation about what we want to do about this.' So why is the public just now hearing about it?""

Once on the House floor, HB 1219 was read three times as required. The first reading came on April 22 (a Wednesday), the second on April 24 (a Friday).

The bill was read a third time, and amendments were considered on April 27 (the following Monday). The bill passed at 4:40 p.m.

We should make clear that the Cannon legislation didn't directly allow oil and natural gas exploration in Florida waters; rather, it permitted the governor and cabinet to allow drilling. Another step would have been required.

Regardless, the bill language was first made public on a Monday night and initially looked at by legislators the next morning. It passed the the following Monday. Total time in the hopper: Five working days.

The special session to consider the oil drilling constitutional amendment was scheduled to last four days. Of course, it lasted just a few hours.

In chastising Republican lawmakers, state CFO Alex Sink said the House ""shoved through a proposal in just a few days to open state waters to oil drilling."" It took House lawmakers just five working days from first seeing the bill to passing it.
