Unemployment was the lowest ever a year ago? No, it was the highest ever
","Less than two months after signing into law his $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, which was aimed at providing relief from the coronavirus pandemic, President Joe Biden unveiled two spending proposals totaling more than $4 trillion. Backlash came in the form of a widely circulated Facebook post that didn’t name Biden, but described his approach narrowly. It made this lament: ""WHY DO WE NEED A $4 TRILLION JOBS PLAN, WHEN A YEAR AGO WE HAD THE LOWEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN HISTORY WITHOUT USING TAXPAYERS MONEY?"" The April 24 post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post is wrong in three ways: Biden’s $4 trillion in plans encompass much more than just jobs. A year before the post — in April 2020, with the coronavirus pandemic hitting hard — unemployment was at a record high, not a record low. Around that time, President Donald Trump authorized spending of trillions in taxpayer dollars, too. Just before the end of March 2020, he signed a $2.2 trillion bill COVID-19 relief bill. News headlines have referred to Biden’s two plans as a $4 trillion plan, or $4 trillion in plans. Neither of his two blueprints has yet been presented as a bill to Congress. The $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan, presented as an infrastructure program, would go beyond roads and bridges to water systems and broadband, as well as to programs such as care for the elderly and disabled.  Biden’s $1.8 trillion American Families Plan, which he outlined in his first speech to Congress, includes child care subsidies and tuition-free community college and pre-K. Unemployment in March 2021, the latest month for which figures have been released, was 6%. That’s far below what it was early in the pandemic, in early 2020. A year before the Facebook post, in April 2020, the unemployment rate was 14.7%.  That is the highest on record (since 1948), according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which cited the pandemic. Forty-three states had historically high unemployment rates that month. (Estimates during the Great Depression are not directly comparable and are not official statistics, according to the agency.) Like Biden, Trump authorized spending tax dollars to rescue the economy. On March 27, 2020, just before unemployment hit its record high, Trump signed a $2.2 trillion emergency coronavirus package into law.  He also signed a $900 billion COVID-19 relief bill, on Dec. 27, 2020. Before the coronavirus outbreak, unemployment had been low under Trump. In April 2019, it was 3.6%, the lowest rate since December 1969.  The lowest unemployment rate on record is 2.5%. That was reached twice, in May and June of 1953. A Facebook post said: ""Why do we need a $4 trillion jobs plan, when a year ago we had the lowest unemployment in history without using taxpayers money?"" Biden has proposed two spending plans totaling $4 trillion, but they go well beyond jobs. A year before the post, in April 2020, the unemployment rate was the highest on record, not the lowest. In late-March 2020, Trump signed a $2.2 trillion COVID-19 relief bill into law.

Airplane over coliseum wasn’t spying on Arizona audit
","The Republican-orchestrated audit of ballots cast in Arizona’s Maricopa County is rife with conspiracy theories. The latest one involves spies in the sky. ""Spy Plane Identified Circling the Arizona Veterans Memorial Coliseum Where the Election Audit Is Taking Place – What’s Going On?"" stated a May 3 headline on David Harris Jr.’s website.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Facebook post is wrong. Biden won Arizona by about 10,000 votes in November, flipping the state to the Democrats after Donald Trump’s win in 2016. Maricopa County — the state’s largest and home to the capital, Phoenix — found no abnormalities in earlier audits, but state Senate Republicans sought to pursue their own audit of the battleground county. Election experts nationwide, including Republicans, have said the audit lacks transparency and is unnecessary. The Facebook post provides no evidence to back up the claim that there was a spy plane circling the coliseum, the site of the audit of 2.1 million ballots. The Facebook post attributes the information to The Gateway Pundit, a source of inaccurate claims about the presidential election results. The Gateway Pundit wrote that it had received information that an airplane had been circling the coliseum. But the accompanying map showed the flight path wasn’t above the coliseum, just nearby. The Gateway Pundit updated the story to say the airplane was registered to the city of Phoenix. The updated article included a response from Sgt. Maggie Cox, a Phoenix police spokesperson: ""This was brought to our attention by another media outlet. The article narrative is not accurate. While the maps do accurately represent our flights, both times ... the aircraft was on police calls that had nothing to do with the events at the Veteran Memorial Coliseum. Please update your news story.""  Cox gave PolitiFact a similar statement. She said that one of the airplane calls was related to a stolen vehicle. The airplane ""was not over the coliseum,"" Cox said. ""It has nothing to do with the events in the coliseum. It’s not over the audit — I verified that with the air unit.""  The police department’s website says the air support unit flies about 8,000 hours a year and assists in pursuits by vehicle and foot, recovers stolen vehicles and executes mountain rescues.  We found no evidence that a plane was deployed to spy on the audit.

No, the Green New Deal doesn't cost average households 'almost $700,000'
","U.S. Rep. Ben Cline recently put an eye-popping taxpayer price tag on the Green New Deal - a bold but vague climate change-centered plan that has been roundly condemned by Republicans. ""It crushes jobs, costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029,"" Cline, R-Va., said of the proposal during a brief floor speech on April 22.  Think about it. The average annual household income in 2019, the latest year available, was $68,700. The average household cost of the Green New Deal, according to Cline’s statement, would be about $75,000 a year. Cline is essentially saying every penny of earnings by an average household will be swallowed by the plan. Cline, who represents Virginia’s 6th Congressional District, running from Roanoke through the Shenandoah Valley, is hardly the first Republican to make this $700,000 statement. It’s been a talking point for two years. Fortunately for taxpayers, the claim doesn’t hold up. Here’s why: Green New Deal Basics The Green New Deal is a resolution - that is, a non-binding proposal and not actual legislation. It has been introduced in the House by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y. and is cosponsored by 101 Democrats. There’s a companion resolution in the Senate introduced by Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., and cosponsored by 12 Democrats. The measures have been referred to subcommittees. Ocasio-Cortez and Markey introduced almost identical Green New Deal resolutions in 2019 that met heavy Republican opposition. One was killed in the Senate and the other never came up for a vote in the House. Broadly speaking, the resolutions address ways to curb climate change and protect the environment. Their far-reaching goals include ""eliminating pollution and greenhouse gas emissions as much as technologically feasible"" and ""meeting 100% of the power demand in the United States through clean, renewable, and zero-emission energy sources.""  The Green New Deal reaches into other policy areas, as well. It calls for creation of ""millions of high-wage union jobs,"" investment in infrastructure, and ""promoting social justice and equality."" But the proposals have never laid out cost figures. And they have not received a cost estimate by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office — the gold-standard source on pricing proposed federal programs. Source of the $700,000 figure Cline’s office told us the congressman’s $700,000 tax figure comes from a 2019 report on the Green New Deal by the American Action Forum, which describes itself as a ""center-right"" think tank. The forum is a sister organization of the American Action Network, a conservative, nonprofit advocacy organization. The report doesn’t mention the $700,000 figure or a total for the estimated per-household cost. However, it does show estimated household costs for different parts of the Green New Deal from 2020-2029. Most of the cost estimates were expressed in ranges. Cline said the Green New Deal  ""costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029,"" - which suggests a massive tax increase for every family. But the American Action Forum analysis doesn’t actually say that typical households will pay that cost in new taxes.  If we add up the high-end range estimate in each category, it comes to $671,010 between 2020 and 2029. If we add up the low-end figure in each category, it comes to $369,010. To come up with estimates, the American Action Forum made a series of assumptions, such as that the Green New Deal would invest so heavily in high-speed rail transit ""that air travel becomes unnecessary."" The actual text of the resolution does not call for grounding airplanes.  The American Action Forum analysis also assumed the plan would include a Medicare for All proposal similar to one made by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and estimated it would cost average households $260,000 over 10 years. However, the texts of the green resolutions don’t mention Medicare for All -- instead, they more broadly call for ""hig h quality health care"" for everyone. The American Action Forum put a number of caveats in its study that Cline and many other Republicans omit. It said, ""The breadth of its proposals makes it daunting to assess the (Green New Deal) using the standard tools of policy analysis"" and called its study an ""initial foray."" The researchers wrote that many of the goals in the plan would require policies that are ""redundant with other aspects in it, which also complicates a precise analysis, as the interactions are difficult to predict."" The report’s lead author is Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of American Action Forum and former director of the Congressional Budget Office. He has told PolitiFact he would need more details about the Green New Deal to conduct a more specific cost analysis. Our ruling Cline said the Green New Deal ""costs an average American household almost $700,000 through 2029."" The Green New Deal is a set of goals, not detailed policies attached to specific taxes. The $700,000 number comes from a brief that its author, the right-of-center American Action Forum, acknowledges is a preliminary and rough estimate. The analysis did not say an average household would pay an extra $700,000 in taxes. Instead, it estimated a range of possible costs under different scenarios over 10 years and Cline took the highest number.  It’s possible the resolution will eventually lead to specific legislation that can be formally analyzed for potential costs, but at this point, the proposals are murky. So, we rate Cline’s statement False.   ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C51C440>],/factchecks/2021/may/05/ben-cline/no-green-new-deal-doesnt-cost-average-households-a/

No, Gavin Newsom Did Not ‘Just Let 76,000 Inmates Out Of Jail,’ As Recall Candidate John Cox Claimed
","Republican recall election candidate John Cox cozied up with a live, 1,000-pound Kodiak bear and branded himself as ""a beast"" at his campaign kick-off event in Sacramento on Tuesday, before criticizing Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom over his handling of the pandemic, power blackouts and housing crisis.  But Cox also made a wild — and beastly — falsehood: He claimed Newsom had just released tens of thousands of inmates onto the streets.  That’s simply not the case.  ""[People] don't want to live in fear of fires, or live in fear of rising crime. I mean, [Newsom] just let 76,000 inmates out of jail with almost no warning,"" Cox said at the event, as the bear named Tag, who has appeared in movies and TV shows, alternated between lying down and pacing.  ""Many of those are going to commit other crimes. I mean, what are we going to do, then I want my daughter to feel safe. I want everybody to feel safe,"" the candidate added.  ""Many of those are going to commit other crimes. I mean, what are we going to do, then I want my daughter to feel safe. I want everybody to feel safe."" We fact-checked Cox’ statement that Newsom ""just let 76,000 inmates out of jail with almost no warning.""   Our Research Here’s what actually happened:  Late last week, the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation expanded a controversial program that allows prison inmates to shorten their sentences in exchange for good behavior and participating in rehabilitation. The agency cited its authority under voter approved Proposition 57 to create new opportunities for good behavior credits. Democratic state lawmakers support such efforts, while many Republicans lawmakers do not.  Cox is correct that the move was done with little public notice. But the rest of his statement distorts reality. The credit expansion allows 76,000 prisoners, including some violent and repeat felons, to potentially reduce their time served by one-third instead of one-fifth under the program, which has been in place since 2017.  ""These changes do not result in the automatic release of any incarcerated individual,"" Dana Simas, a spokesperson for the state prisons agency, wrote in an email. ""This is NOT an early release program, this is an expansion of Good Conduct Credits that the population must earn through participation in rehabilitative programs and sustained good behavior."" Simas added that it will be ""months or years"" before any inmates are released as a result of this initiative.  We contacted the Cox campaign and did not hear back.  The San Diego County businessman is one of several Republicans running in the election to recall Newsom.  The California secretary of state's office announced late last month that supporters of the effort had collected enough valid signatures to force the recall vote, which is expected to take place this fall. Voters will have the option to select whether they want Newsom to remain as governor and to vote on a potential replacement. Sharp Reduction In California’s Prison Population Over the past decade, California has sharply cut its prison population following a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. The population reached a peak of 163,000 inmates in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. In 2014, voters reduced penalties for property and drug crimes. Two years later, they approved allowing earlier parole for most inmates.  Before the pandemic hit, the prison population had dropped to 117,00 inmates, the Associated Press reported this week. In the last year, 21,000 more have left state prisons — with about half being held temporarily in county jails. Last year, California sped up the release of 3,500 inmates to reduce crowding as COVID-19 spread through prisons statewide, according to the Los Angeles Times. It freed 2,345 others early last July.  Republican lawmakers have frequently criticized the state’s efforts to reduce its prison population, saying early releases make communities less safe.  Like Cox, Rep. Mike Garcia, R-Los Angeles, condemned the state’s move in a campaign press release this week.  His statement distorted the credit program and suggested the release of inmates was imminent. ""Just when you think California couldn’t enact more idiotic policies, the politicians in Sacramento are now putting children and families in danger by releasing tens of thousands of violent criminals into our communities,"" the Garcia press release said.  Our Ruling  California recall candidate for governor John Cox claimed Gov. Gavin Newsom ""just let 76,000 inmates out of jail with almost no warning.""  That’s just wrong.  The California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation expanded a good behavior and rehabilitation program that will make 76,000 inmates eligible for somewhat shorter sentences. The agency made this move without much public notice, but did so using authority granted under voter-approved Proposition 57.  No one has been released under the expanded program and officials estimate it will be months or years before that happens.  We rate Cox’s statement as False.   FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FBBC00>],/factchecks/2021/may/05/john-cox/no-gavin-newsom-did-not-just-let-76000-inmates-out/

Johnson falsely claims Wisconsin didn’t account for in-person hours when allocating federal stimulus
","As public school students in Milwaukee and Madison return to the classroom for the first time in more than a year, administrators across the state are still trying to figure out how to spend federal stimulus money earmarked for schools. 
  How the money is allotted to schools across the state has become a hot topic -- especially among Republicans, who think more money should be given to schools that were quick to return to an in-person teaching model last fall.  U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin took to Twitter to criticize what he called a ""shotgun approach"" for directing stimulus money to schools.  
""No distinctions are being made between Wisconsin schools that remained closed to in-person learning, and those that have been re-opened for months,"" he tweeted April 8, 2021.  So Johnson claims Wisconsin didn’t allocate more money to schools that were already back in person over those still choosing to make use of virtual schools.  Is it true?  Johnson’s office did not return multiple requests for more information. But Johnson did include a link to a news report in the tweet, so we have some additional context.  The link was to an April 7, 2021 story from the Wisconsin State Journal about the $2.4 billion in federal stimulus aid allocated to the state under the three stimulus plans passed since the outbreak of the coronavirus pandemic in 2020.  Let’s look deeper at the story, and the issue as a whole. The story notes that 90 percent of the money is being allocated to schools based on the number of low-income students in each district. In that sense, Johnson has a point -- the formula is not based on how much time schools spent in the classroom, or in remote learning. But the state does not have discretion in how to split up that money. How it is spent is governed by the federal stimulus measures that passed, two under Republican Donald Trump and one under Democrat Joe Biden. Chris Bucher, communications specialist for the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction, said that portion of the funding was allocated using the Title I formula, which takes into account the percentage of children from low-income families, based on Census data. States were only given discretion on how to distribute the remaining 10 percent, which amounts to about $65.5 million in Wisconsin. And that is where Johnson’s claim is off. 
The state Department of Public Instruction developed a plan for the funding, which went to the Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee for approval. That committee, like the Legislature, is controlled by Republicans. Gov. Tony Evers could veto the spending decision, but the committee could still override his veto.  For its part, the finance committee added a component to the DPI plan that requires the total number of in-person instructional hours provided during the 2020-21 school year be taken into account when the money is distributed. That would favor districts that went back in person early over others that didn’t, such as Milwaukee Public Schools and Madison Metropolitan School District. District-by-district allocations for the in-person schooling-based funding have not yet been decided, according to an April 5, 2021 summary from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau. To comply with the new formula, the department is planning to collect data on the number of in-person days of school at the end of the school year, Bucher said.  Johnson claimed that when distributing federal money, ""No distinctions are being made between Wisconsin schools that remain closed to in-person learning, and those that have been re-opened for months.""  But lawmakers in Wisconsin did put some restrictions on money sent to school districts based on how many days of in-person schooling took place during the 2020-21 school year. Federal funds, however, were not distributed in that way.  We rate Johnson’s claim Mostly False.   ",[<zip object at 0x00000280979C8740>],/factchecks/2021/may/05/ron-johnson/johnson-falsely-claims-wisconsin-didnt-account-per/

Ron DeSantis’ misleading claim about crime, police funding
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis lauded a new state law he championed as ""the strongest anti-rioting, pro-law enforcement piece of legislation in the country."" The new law increased the criminal penalties for offenses committed ""in furtherance of a riot or an aggravated riot."" It also allows state attorneys or city council members to appeal budget proposals that seek to reduce police operating budgets to the state’s Administration Commission. The commission, made up of the governor and Cabinet, has the final say. ""This bill actually prevents against local governments defunding law enforcement,"" DeSantis said after signing the bill April 19. ""We’ll be able to stop it at the state level. And if you look at some of these places that have done this, they’ve already seen crime go up."" DeSantis’ office pointed to news reports about increased crime in six places: New York City, Los Angeles, Austin, Washington, D.C., Minneapolis and Philadelphia. The types of crimes and time periods used to measure those increases varied per city. Those cities did reduce or redistribute some police funding as they grappled with the coronavirus pandemic and activists’ calls to spend less on policing and more on mental health services and anti-crime programs. However, criminologists disputed DeSantis’ link between budget cuts and worsened crime. Experts said the limited data and selective time frames disregard key points: Murder and gun violence were already up in 2020, before cities changed their budgets. (Some of the six cities are still in the process of shifting money from the police.) Cities that did not cut police budgets also saw murder go up in 2020. ""These comparisons of crime increases with reductions in police budget or personnel are strictly anecdotal. In the first instance, they should be compared with crime changes in cities that have not altered policing,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, a University of Missouri, St. Louis expert on crime trends. ""Moreover, they are at best correlations between crime changes and policing. They say nothing about whether or how the changes to policing caused the crime changes."" A proper evaluation of budget changes and their impact on crime should control for multiple factors that influence criminal activity, said Charis E. Kubrin, a criminologist at the University of California, Irvine. Those factors include poverty, joblessness, drugs, gangs, guns, housing insecurity and demographic shifts, she said. After George Floyd’s killing by a police officer in May 2020, activists protesting racial discrimination and excessive use of force by police called on cities to ""defund the police."" While some protesters want to eliminate police departments entirely, others want to revisit the functions of police departments and reroute some police funding toward other services. The six cities flagged by DeSantis did not abolish police departments or cancel their budgets. But they approved less funding for police departments for fiscal 2021. Some responded by transferring police duties to other city departments, eliminating funding earmarked for overtime pay, imposed hiring freezes, among other measures. The cities made budget changes to fiscal years that started as early as July 1, 2020, and as late as Jan. 1, 2021. PolitiFact reached out to each of the six cities to learn more about their budget changes and how significant they were in relation to the overall police budget. We heard back from most, but got limited information. In Philadelphia, a $33 million cut to the police budget represents about 4.5% of the department’s adopted general fund budget of $727 million. New York City officials last year said they agreed to remove $1 billion from the police department’s spending. (The Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group, said the net reduction to the police budget so far has been about $477 million.) The department’s total budget for 2021 was $10.2 billion. Los Angeles cut $150 million from the police operating budget. The department’s 2021 budget is more than $1.7 billion. Minneapolis officials in December said they shifted $7.8 million from the proposed police budget to other city departments. Overall, the city approved $164 million for the police department. (The city’s fiscal year runs concurrently with the calendar year.) The Austin American-Statesman reported on a $150 million cut to the police budget, which represents about one-third of the police budget. But city spokesperson Jaquarry Wilson disputed the characterization of funds being cut, saying $121.7 million ""was simply moved into two transition funds"" while city staff determines which services can be offered by other city departments. Another $31.5 million was reinvested in other community safety initiatives in other departments, Wilson said. DeSantis’ claim did not take into consideration how crime manifested nationally in 2020. Many cities saw spikes in homicides in 2020, regardless of changes to their police budgets. Crime increases are likely the result of the ""social disorganization"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic, said Samuel Walker, an emeritus professor of criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha. Social disorganization involves a weakening of the basic bonds of social control, such as good employment and stable families. Nationwide, murder went up every quarter of 2020 compared with the respective quarters in 2019, according to preliminary FBI data. The number of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter offenses increased 14.8% nationwide in the first half of 2020 compared with the same period in 2019, according to preliminary data reported to the FBI by more than 12,000 U.S. law enforcement agencies. At the same time, the FBI said there were overall declines in the number of violent crimes and property crimes. ""The complicated drivers of 2020's large murder increase were clearly already well established before budget cuts for 2021 were passed,"" said Jeff Asher, a crime analyst and co-founder of consulting firm AH Datalytics. Some of the local news reports offered by DeSantis’ office also compared homicides in 2021 with 2020. One report focused on New York City murders over the first 10 days of 2021 versus the first 10 days of 2020; another looked at Philadelphia homicides from the beginning of 2021 through mid-March, compared with the same period in 2020. Short-term homicide data can be ""notoriously unreliable,"" said Michael Campbell, a criminologist at the University of Denver. Homicides are relatively rare compared with other crimes, leading to large fluctuations in the homicide rates. ""However, everything points to a broad uptick in homicide, domestic violence, gun crimes and other serious offenses,"" Campbell said. ""Things are bad everywhere and it’s easy to point at these big cities but it’s impossible to determine any clear relationship and I’d be surprised if one ever emerges."" Cuts in police funding don’t automatically mean the department will make a decision that puts public safety at risk. When police departments have a reduced budget, they try to make adjustments that spare services for citizens or affect their perception of safety, said Kevin Robinson, a lecturer at Arizona State University's School of Criminology & Criminal Justice. Departments, for example, could opt to replace a patrol vehicle every five years instead of four, said Robinson, who served in the Phoenix Police Department for nearly 40 years. Bloomberg CityLab analyzed the 2021 police budgets of the 50 largest U.S. cities in January. On the whole, the cities’ police budgets were reduced by 5.2%. But spending on police as a share of general expenditures rose slightly to 13.7%. At least 24 cities increased police funding for 2021, Tampa among them, Bloomberg reported. Tampa city officials in September voted to increase the police department’s budget by $13 million for fiscal 2021, to $176 million. The Tampa Bay Times around mid-November reported that Tampa, like other cities nationwide, saw an uptick in murders in 2020 compared with 2019. DeSantis said, ""If you look at some of these places that (cut police funding), they’ve already seen crime go up."" An element of truth in DeSantis’ claim is that crime went up in six major cities. But he said it was because of budget cuts, when murder and gun violence were already trending up in 2020, before cities changed their budgets. None of the budget changes have been in place for a whole year, so it’s too early to tell the extent of their impact on crime, if any. A proper assessment would control for many factors that influence criminal activity, experts said.

Then, the new members voted to end the mask requirement in Vail schools.""  More than 100 parents did show up before a school board meeting in Vail, Ariz., on April 27 to call on board members to end a rule requiring students to wear face masks. ""Owing to the commotion,"" Newsweek reported, board members decided not to hold their meeting as planned, and the protesters nominated five people from their own ranks to form a new governing body. The group then decided themselves that the mask mandate should be optional. But this wasn’t an official election. It took place in a hallway, defied laws dictating how a school board member can be elected or recalled, and changed nothing about the board’s makeup or the district’s mask mandate.  ""It was a media stunt,"" said Chris King, one of the district’s five board members. ""It was essentially the same as electing who’s going to be the banker in a game of Monopoly. That’s the same authority.""  Several board members and Darcy Mentone, a spokesperson for the district, told us that no one from the board was removed or resigned. Recalling a board member requires a petitioner who lives in the school district to collect signatures from at least 25% of voters in that area, or approximately 5,000 people, Mentone said. If the petition is filed on time, the recall is put on a ballot.  There is likewise a formal process to run for the school board.  On April 30, the district did decide to allow students to take off their masks outside when they’re at school, but this decision was made by the superintendent, Mentone said, not the board.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EE4080>],/factchecks/2021/may/04/viral-image/no-parents-didnt-oust-school-board-vail-arizona/

No, Red Cross isn't warning vaccinated people not to donate blood
","UPDATE, July 26, 2021, 3:50 p.m.: The American Red Cross stopped accepting donations of convalescent plasma on June 25, because of a surplus of supplies and waning demand from hospitals. Jessica Merrill, director of biomedical communications for the group, said that under federal guidelines, vaccinated people are still eligible to donate plasma.   A TikToker detailed his experience of donating plasma at a location of the American Red Cross, where he said he was warned by a woman who worked there not to get the vaccine.  ""She told me, ‘because you won’t be able to donate plasma if you’ve had the shot,’"" the man in the video said. ""I asked her if it’s just out of precaution because you don’t know what’s in it? She said, ‘no, we know what’s in it. That’s why you can’t donate blood, because it’s completely tainted.’"" The man went on to say that if the Red Cross is warning people that the COVID-19 vaccine is tainted, it’s probably best to listen, since they’ve been around for a long time. But that isn’t what the Red Cross really says. Despite what the Tik Tok user might have heard, the Red Cross issued a news release on Feb. 24, 2021, that said people can indeed donate blood, platelets and AB Elite plasma after receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. TikTok identified this video as part of its efforts to counter inauthentic, misleading or false content. (Read more about PolitiFact's partnership with TikTok.) The Red Cross offered some additional details: People can donate blood as long as they know which company manufactured the vaccine: Pfizer, Moderna or Johnson & Johnson. The organization also lists recipients of two vaccines that are in trials in the U.S., Novavax and AstraZeneca, as eligible for blood donation. As long as a person has the manufacturer’s name and they feel healthy, without symptoms of COVID-19, it’s safe to donate right afterward.  ""Knowing the name of the vaccine manufacturer is important in determining donor eligibility,"" said American Red Cross spokesperson Jessica Merrill. ""If a donor does not know the name of the manufacturer of the vaccine they received, they will be asked to wait for two weeks before giving blood."" The donation process for a vaccinated person is the same as usual, Merrill said. It takes about one hour, and includes registration upon arrival, a confidential questionnaire about their health history and places traveled, and checks of temperature, hemoglobin, blood pressure and pulse.  Merrill said one reason for misinformation about blood donation following the COVID-19 vaccine is that many regular blood donors are aware that some immunizations do require a wait period. However, Merrill said that’s not the case with the COVID-19 vaccines. ""Similar to other vaccines such as measles, mumps or influenza, the COVID-19 vaccine — including the J&J vaccine — is designed to generate an immune response to help protect an individual from illness, but vaccine components themselves are not found within the bloodstream,"" Merrill said. Distribution of the J&J vaccine resumed in the U.S. after health authorities paused its use to investigate limited cases of blood clots.  ""There is no evidence of or reason to suspect an increased risk of blood clots as a result of donating blood after receiving a J&J vaccine or for patients who receive donations from these individuals,"" Merrill said. In a TikTok video, a man said he was told by a staff member at the American Red Cross that a person vaccinated against COVID-19 can’t donate plasma, because their blood has been completely tainted.  The Red Cross refuted this statement, saying that a vaccinated person can indeed donate blood if they know who manufactured their vaccine and they are healthy. If the person doesn’t know who manufactured the vaccine, they must wait two weeks before donating. All COVID-19 vaccines, including the J&J shot, are safe for blood donations.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978BEDC0>],/factchecks/2021/may/04/tiktok-posts/no-red-cross-isnt-warning-vaccinated-people-not-do/

No proof for pro-Trump conspiracy theory of secret watermarks on Ariz. ballots
","Nearly six months after Joe Biden defeated former President Donald Trump, contractors hired by Arizona Senate Republicans are auditing results in Maricopa County, home to Phoenix and the state Capitol, where some Republicans have made allegations of widespread voter fraud. These claims have been dismissed in court and refuted by a sampled hand count of ballots. Maricopa also hired two independent firms to conduct a forensic audit of its tabulation equipment. The audit found no abnormalities. But a new spin on an old conspiracy theory has emerged during the recount. It builds on a debunked narrative that Trump’s administration put secret watermarks on official ballots to trick cheating Democrats. (Pants on Fire!) The new version makes allusions to ultraviolet light and an acronym for president that refers to Trump. ""Auditors are now using UV light to scan across all ballots. POTUS told us the 2020 election would be stolen via fake printed ballots. We were right about specially marker ballots all along, the media and left called us all crazy, but we knew,"" says a post widely shared on Facebook. ""The Maricopa audit is confirming the rumors, that real ballots have a special watermark. No wonder the Democrats tried to stall... NCSWIC."" NCSWIC, for ""Nothing Can Stop What Is Coming,"" is used by adherents of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. With the Facebook post is a photo of three people at machines. The letter Q is above the photo along with this headline: ""WATCH THE WATER.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The Maricopa County Elections Department confirmed a previous statement that it does not use watermarks or any other ""secret markings"" on its ballots. And no evidence has emerged that the contractors have found any evidence of watermarks. Ken Bennett, the state Senate Republicans’ liaison for the audit, told PolitiFact that auditors did initially scan ballots with UV lights to see if there were watermarks. But they are no longer using UV lights, Bennett told PolitiFact on May 3. We told Bennett that Facebook posts state that the audit had confirmed rumors about ballots having a special watermark.  ""There is no evidence of that and findings would not be released in the middle of the audit anyway, that is pure speculation or made up whatever,"" said Bennett, a former Arizona secretary of state. QAnon emerged in October 2017 and is rooted in the unsubstantiated belief that an array of public figures are Satan-worshipping, cannibalistic pedophiles and Trump was in charge of a covert effort to arrest and expose them. Facebook has banned QAnon pages, groups and accounts since October, but posts such as these continue to proliferate. The ""watch the water"" comment comes from a February 2018 QAnon thread, known as a ""Q drop,"" which are cryptic messages that the central figure of the conspiracy theory posts for followers to decipher. The watermark claim around election day that we fact-checked tried to connect watermarks with ""watch the water,"" as the new claims appears to do.  Republicans in November started to raise challenges to the presidential election in Arizona, centering largely on Maricopa County, after Biden narrowly won the state following Trump’s win there in 2016. In March, Senate Republicans announced that they had hired a team, led by a Florida-based technology company called Cyber Ninjas, to conduct the audit. Cyber Ninjas doesn’t appear to have previous experience in election audits. The firm is led by Doug Logan, who was part of the ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election. A voice mail message left for Logan was not returned. The outcome of the audit will have no impact on the 2020 election results, which were certified by state officials in November. On Jan. 6, Congress voted to accept those results showing that Biden won Arizona and the presidency. A Facebook post claims that an audit of the 2020 election in Maricopa County, Ariz., ""is confirming the rumors that real ballots have a special watermark"" — suggesting that fake ballots could have been cast in an effort to prevent Trump from being re-elected president. Maricopa County says it does not use watermarks on its ballots.  No evidence has emerged that the audit, led by a firm headed up by a man who was part of the ""stop the steal"" conspiracy theories about the election, has found any evidence of watermarks.

About 26.9 million people watched Biden’s first address to Congress, not 11.6 million
","Although President Joe Biden’s first speech to Congress wasn’t officially called a State of the Union address, that hasn’t stopped social media users from comparing Biden’s viewership to viewership of former President Donald Trump’s State of the Union addresses. One image posted on Facebook claims that Trump’s State of the Union speeches were viewed by three to four times the number of people who watched Biden’s April 28 address to a joint session of Congress. The image reads: ""TV Ratings for Presidential Addresses: President Trump 2017 — 48,000,000 President Trump 2018 — 46,000,000 President Trump 2019 — 46,800,000 President Trump 2020 — 37,200,000 Biden 2021 — 11,600,000"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Are the numbers correct? Yes and no.  PolitiFact looked at viewership numbers compiled by the Nielsen Company, which tracks television viewership data.  Based on Nielsen’s data, the post is correct about the number of viewers who tuned in to watch Trump address the joint sessions of Congress. Nielsen reported the following numbers for ""combined number of viewers"":  Feb. 28, 2017: 47,741,000 viewers Jan. 30, 2018: 45,551,000 viewers Feb. 5, 2019: 46,789,000 viewers Feb. 4, 2020: 37,173,000 viewers When compared to the numbers provided in the post, there isn’t much deviation.  The post rounded the Trump figures up to nearest hundred-thousand or million. But, all in all, the numbers accurately reflect viewership of Trump’s addresses. The viewership number offered for Biden’s first address to Congress was incorrect, however. Nielsen reported that 26.9 million people watched Biden’s speech on April 28. While that was low compared with Trump and other predecessors, it is more than double the post’s claim of 11.6 million viewers. So far, in 2021, television viewership is down, according to Nielsen’s data. Both the Associated Press and CNN attributed a portion of Biden’s lower ratings to people watching less live TV in favor of watching more on-demand programming. ""Presidents who are more compelling naturally attract more attention than those who are seen as more staid,"" said Alison Dagnes, a political science professor at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania whose areas of expertise include American political media and public opinion.  When asked about Biden's lower viewership numbers, she said, ""Say what you will about Donald Trump: but he wasn’t boring."" In addition, Dagnes said she believed the pandemic had an impact on the size of Biden's TV audience because the public is ""exhausted.""  ""The Trump years were chaotic and overwhelming, even if one was a Trump supporter, and then the pandemic forced everyone to be hyper-vigilant,"" she said. ""One primary appeal of Joe Biden thus far, according to polling, is that he is governing quietly. The nation is tired. I wasn’t surprised that the TV ratings were as low as they were."" An image posted on Facebook claimed that Biden’s first address to Congress had only 11.6 million viewers, while Trump’s presidential addresses were watched by three to four times that number of people. The post provided accurate viewership numbers for Trump’s presidential addresses overall. But the post was incorrect about the number of people who watched Biden’s address.

Janet Yellen partly correct about corporate income, GDP
","President Joe Biden wants to pay for much of his American Jobs Plan — a $2.65 trillion proposal to fund infrastructure, research and development, and other items — by raising the corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%.  That’s still below the 35% rate in effect before the tax law President Donald Trump signed in 2017. But Republicans argue that any increase would leave the United States at a competitive disadvantage internationally. On the May 2 edition of NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen defended the administration’s approach, suggesting that corporate profits are rising yet largely escaping taxation. ""Right now, corporate income tax amounts to only 7% of total federal tax revenue, and corporate income has increased as a share"" of gross domestic product, Yellen said.  ""This comes also in the context of global negotiations to try to stop a decades-long race to the bottom among countries in competing for business by lowering their corporate tax rates,"" she added. ""And we feel that will be successful."" Yellen was on target when she said corporate income taxes account for about 7% of federal tax revenues. But we wondered whether she was right to say that corporate income has increased as a share of GDP.  The answer is yes over the long term, but not much in recent years. Economists we interviewed agreed that a reasonable metric for assessing Yellen’s claim is after-tax corporate profits as a percentage of GDP, which is calculated every year by the U.S. Commerce Department’s Bureau of Economic Analysis. The data shows that this figure has fluctuated between about 4% and 8% since the end of the Great Depression.   If you leave out a three-year dip during the upheaval of the 2007-09 Great Recession, the percentage in recent years has stayed within an even narrower band. Between 2004 to 2019, corporate profits have fluctuated between 6.5% and 7.7% of GDP. (Data for 2020 is not available yet, but the coronavirus pandemic is expected to skew the data anyway.) This doesn’t amount to a large or sustained increase. There’s no clear upward trend line.  ""The definition of 'gone up' is in the eye of the beholder, but it does not look like much,"" said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the center-right American Action Forum. However, if you look over a longer period of time, the data does provide some support for Yellen’s assertion. The averages by decade show the period from 2010 to 2019 has the highest percentage since the start of data collection in the 1930s.   Based on this slicing of the data, ""I’d say Secretary Yellen is basically correct,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution. The Treasury Department did not provide further information for this article. Yellen said, ""Corporate income has increased as a share of"" gross domestic product. We found no dramatic upward trend line in corporate profits as a share of GDP. In fact, if you separate out three years during the Great Recession, the percentage has moved within a narrow band for the past decade and a half. However, over the longer term, the decade between 2010 and 2019 did have a higher percentage than any decade going back to the 1930s.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Wolf Blitzer was wrong to say the wealthiest pay the most in taxes
","
Editor's note: On Sept. 13, 2011, we checked Wasserman's Schultz's claim that it's not true that 50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax. But we broadened this fact-check on Sept. 16, after her spokesman said she was referring to the other portion of Wolf Blitzer's statement. 
Before the Republican candidates for president took center stage in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011, for the CNN/Tea Party Express debate, Democratic National Committee chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz talked with CNN's Wolf Blitzer -- and the conversation quickly turned into a back-and-forth over taxes. 
Blitzer tried to make the point that wealthy Americans might already pay the most taxes, while Wasserman Schultz countered that their tax rates are the lowest they've been since the 1950s. We watched the ships pass in the night.

The lead-in was about President Barack Obama's jobs bill, and how Republicans seem steadfastly opposed to raising any tax on anyone. Here's what followed:

BLITZER: All right, we don't have to debate the whole issue of taxes and wealthy and all of that. (But) the wealthiest Americans, they pay the most in taxes already -- 50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax, because ...

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No, that's actually not true, Wolf.

BLITZER: Fifty percent, you don't ...

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: We're at the low -- in terms of the wealthiest Americans, we're at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s.

BLITZER: I know, but they pay a huge chunk of the federal income tax, the wealthiest Americans. The top 2 percent or 3 percent pay whatever that number is, 30 or 40 percent.

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: But they're still at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s.

BLITZER: Yes, 35 percent.

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: And there have been significant tax breaks from President Obama.

BLITZER: All right. We're not going to get into all of that.

Blitzer cut cut off the debate there -- and we picked it up. Originally, we measured Wasserman Schultz's assertion that Blitzer was wrong to say that ""50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax."" 
But we then heard from Democratic National Committee spokesman Brad Woodhouse, who told us that Wasserman Schultz's objection to Blitzer -- ""No, that's not actually true, Wolf"" -- wasn't in response to his statement about the 50 percent of Americans who don't pay federal income tax (despite what it might have sounded like to viewers). Instead, she was arguing against his claim that ""the wealthiest Americans, they pay the most in taxes already,"" he said. 
Since it's impossible to say exactly which part of the statement she was disagreeing with, we decided to check both. 
(In another item we examined Wasserman Schultz's claim that the wealthiest Americans have the lowest comparative ""tax rate since the 1950s."" We found that Mostly True.) 
To keep it simple, we'll break this fact-check into two parts. First we'll look at whether the wealthiest Americans pay the most in taxes. Then we'll examine whether 50 percent of people pay no federal income taxes at all. 
What the wealthy pay in income taxes 
Blitzer explained his statement about the wealthy's tax burden by saying, ""they pay a huge chunk of the federal income tax, the wealthiest Americans. The top 2 percent or 3 percent pay whatever that number is, 30 or 40 percent.""

Just how big is that chunk?

As PolitiFact has reported, the most recent hard data on this question comes from the 2007 tax year. It can be found in a Congressional Budget Office report released in 2010. CBO's report shows what share of the federal tax liability was shouldered by various income groups. We'll show you the information in a chart.

The top line of the chart groups households by income: The first five columns break down taxpayers in five equal groups, poorest to richest. The last three columns focus solely on the wealthiest Americans. Blitzer first said the wealthiest Americans ""pay the most in taxes,"" then clarified ""federal income tax."" So we've provided a breakdown of both total federal taxes, in the top row -- which also includes Social Security taxes, corporate income taxes, and taxes on goods like gas, tobacco and alcohol -- and in the bottom row, federal income tax. 

 Share of federal taxes in 2007 
  
Blitzer said, ""they pay a huge chunk of the federal income tax, the wealthiest Americans. The top 2 percent or 3 percent pay whatever that number is, 30 or 40 percent."" The most recent CBO report shows that just the top 1 percent of households paid nearly 40 percent of income taxes. Meanwhile, their share of total federal tax liabilities was nearly 30 percent.

For a more recent look, we have to rely on estimates based on 2010 law by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. They show the top 1 percent paying 32 percent of federal income taxes and 22 percent of all federal tax.

That means, if anything, Blitzer's statement about the top 2 or 3 percent's income tax burden may be conservative — he's on the mark just for the top 1 percent.

Meanwhile, Wasserman Schultz responded not with information about share of taxes paid, but with arguments about tax rates. Indeed, Woodhouse provided us with four articles, three of which focused on tax rates, and a fourth that looked at Americans' total tax burden falling as a share of the economy. None of them proved false Blitzer's claim about the size of the wealthiest's share of the tax burden.

Instead, they made a separate observation -- that while the wealthy may pick up a bigger percentage of the federal tab, they're paying a smaller percentage of their income. It's a strong point, but it doesn't make Blitzer's statement any less true. 
How many people pay no federal income taxes 
When it comes to the number of people not paying federal income taxes, Blitzer is pretty close to right. 
The Joint Committee on Taxation, a respected bipartisan committee of Congress found that in 2009 roughly 22 percent of ""tax units"" ended up paying nothing. 
Another 30 percent actually got money back from the government — meaning they made money — through mechanisms such as the Earned Income Tax Credit, a longstanding policy that encourages low-income Americans to work by refunding money through the tax code. 
The caveat here is that the statistic is measured in ""tax units"" — which is people or families who file tax returns. (The calculation will exclude some people, but not, for instance, people who receive unemployment benefits. The Internal Revenue Service considers that taxable income.) 
How did we get to the point where most Americans don’t pay federal income taxes? The main reason is that the United States employs the tax system not just to collect funds but to distribute them as well.

Bob Williams, a tax policy specialist at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, told our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia this is largely carried out through popular tax breaks, which are sometimes called ""tax expenditures.""

""There are lots and lots of them,"" he said. ""We estimate they total more than a trillion dollars a year in reduced taxes, and in fact the bulk of those go to the top end of the income distribution.""

However, because high earners have so much income liability, the breaks they get still don't whittle their taxes down all the way to zero. By contrast, popular lower- and middle-income breaks such as child credits and mortgage interest deductions do get a big share of the population off the hook.

To be fair, we wanted to see if there are more up-to-date figures. The Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center said the number actually has dropped slightly -- and that 49.5 percent of tax filers ended up paying nothing in federal income taxes in 2010. In 2011, the predict the number might drop even more, down to 46.4 percent . 
Our ruling 
During a back-and-forth between Blitzer and Wasserman Schultz, Blitzer said that ""the wealthiest Americans, they pay the most in taxes already -- 50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax."" 
Wasserman Schultz responded by saying ""that's actually not true."" 
But both of Blitzer's points are valid. About half of tax filers pay no federal income tax at all, and the wealthiest Americans -- though they may have a lower rate than they did in the 1950s -- still pay a huge chunk of federal income taxes.

"['Health Care', 'Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Gov. Scott Walker says he asked unions for concessions and they refused
","
In a September 2011 campaign fundraising letter pegged to staving off a possible recall drive against him, Gov. Scott Walker mocked his opponents as the ""old order"" and ""screaming protesters"" blocking bold fiscal reforms.

He focused sharply on labor unions, which fought legislation by Walker and Republican lawmakers to curtail collective bargaining and force  public workers to contribute more toward pensions and health care. That push, which became law, attracted massive and prolonged protests in Madison.

""I asked the unions to pay into their own health care insurance (just as their Wisconsin neighbors do) and they said I was being unreasonable,"" Walker’s letter said. ""I requested that they contribute toward their own pensions (just as their Wisconsin neighbors do) and they screamed it was unfair.""

He added: ""Obviously I made the protectors of the status quo boiling mad.""

Walker’s claim gets at one of the key rhetorical battles left over from the historic budget fight in Madison.

Walker supporters argue it was really always about the money and that’s why organized labor fought so fiercely against Walker’s plan.

Union leaders say their beef was with Walker’s sharp limits on collective bargaining and what that would mean for the future of unions.

Indeed, in the heat of the standoff --  with Senate Democrats delaying action by fleeing to Illinois --  leaders of major unions proclaimed they’d accept the pension and health-insurance benefit changes if the bargaining changes were dropped.

So, what about Walker’s statement -- that he had requested that change, but it was rejected as unreasonable and unfair?

We’ll examine three distinct periods -- the governor’s race of 2010, the post-election period before Walker took office, and Walker’s early months as governor starting in January 2011.

The timing matters.

In mid-February 2011, labor was reeling over Walker’s newly announced plans to impose benefits cuts and curtail collective bargaining for most public employees.

It was at that point that AFSCME Council 24 (the largest state employee union), along with the state teachers union and other labor leaders said they would be willing to trade the concessions if Walker would drop the limits on collective bargaining. AFSCME stands for American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

To be sure, not all members or unions fell in lockstep behind their leaders’ stance. In fact, on March 3 some 7,000 unionists held a ""no concessions, no cuts"" rally in Madison organized by National Nurses United. And the rally was officially backed by several major public sector unions in Wisconsin.

Walker rejected the offer as a ""hope and a prayer"" and said the collective bargaining limits were also crucial to giving local government and schools the flexibility needed to balance their budgets. Unions then pointed to Walker’s reaction as proof he just wanted to gut unions.

Given this whole sequence, can the governor claim unions rejected his request?

That’s where the timing comes in.

When we asked Walker aides for backup for the claim, they pointed us to the reactions of AFSCME Council 24 leader Martin Beil in December 2010 -- when Walker, then the governor-elect, began rolling out details of his push for benefits concessions -- and even further back, to summer 2010, when Walker aired a campaign TV ad on the theme.

At the earlier points, the union had a much different reaction -- to say the least.

We’ll focus on Beil’s AFSCME unit because it represents 22,000 state workers and took the public lead in reacting to Walker.

Here’s a look at the sequence:

June 2010: Walker, then a candidate in the GOP primary, said he would propose major wage and benefit cuts from state employees to help close a huge projected budget shortfall.

Reaction: Beil’s union said Walker was propagating a myth that state workers were overpaid.

""State employees for many years have taken less money in wages so they could have solid pensions that could be there when they retired. Now you've got characters like Walker saying 'We've got to violate that trust,'"" Beil said. ""It would be very difficult for us to easily accept this at the bargaining table.""

November 2010: With the election won, Walker lobbied Gov. Jim Doyle to stop negotiating labor deals on his way out of office. (The tentative agreements included no pay increases and unpaid furlough days that equalled a 3.3 percent pay cut for workers. They called for small increases in employee health premium contributions that were considerably less that Walker later sought.)

Reaction: On Dec. 2, 2010 Beil told Wisconsin Eye, ""What more is there? Does he want our firstborn?"" If Walker wants benefit cuts, Beil said, he should give wage hikes in return.

In that interview he said it could ""get ugly,"" echoing comments he made in a Nov. 16, 2010 interview on Wisconsin Public Television: ""Workers have ability to withhold labor, whether it’s legal or illegal…If pushed I believe state employees will respond by taking matters to the street.""

December 2010: While the lame-duck Legislature considered the Doyle-negotiated union deals, Walker upped the ante.

He made clear he was considering abolishing public unions altogether -- or at least changing state law so he didn’t have to bargain with them -- in order to get more from employees on pensions and health without negotiations that could drag on. Public employees have become ""haves"" and taxpayers ""have nots,"" Walker said.

Reaction: ""State workers and other public workers aren't about to sacrifice their benefits for some political future of a tyrant,"" Beil said. ""This is all about Scott Walker kind of bringing back, instead of public service, it is public servitude. He's the master of the plantation and we're supposed to be his slaves; that's his philosophy here. So I think he'd be real happy if we were paid minimum wage and had no pension at all.""

Later, on the eve of Walker’s inauguration, Beil’s union put out a fact sheet making the case that workers were not overcompensated.

This is a crucial point in time, because union critics often cite the ""plantation/slave"" remarks as the high point of union resistance to monetary concessions.

And this is where evaluating Walker’s recent claim gets interesting.

It’s clear that the biggest state employees’ union reacted negatively -- from the start -- to Walker’s push for concessions on health insurance and pensions.

But during the time period Walker pointed us to, after the election, it’s also clear that union leaders were reacting at least in part to Walker’s suggestions that he might bypass union negotiations to get what he wanted.

Beil’s much-quoted ""slaves"" remarks, for example, came a few days after Walker said he might even act to eliminate the unions altogether. Beil complained that Walker was simply ""issuing mandates.""

There are other problems with Walker’s claim.

In his fundraising letter, Walker painted himself as having ""asked"" or ""requested"" the benefits concessions. A reader unfamiliar with the history might think the governor made an actual offer to the unions in collective bargaining. Or that some talks between the two sides took place.

No such offer was ever made, and there is no evidence of behind-the-scenes talks, according to both sides.

Walker certainly signalled through his public statements that he would seek the concessions, but ultimately -- when it came time to deal with labor -- he chose to end-run the unions and 50 years of collective bargaining history and unveil legislation removing pensions and health insurance from negotiations.

So Walker didn’t ""ask"" -- he told.

Was there ever room to bargain?

In late 2010 when labor dealt with union-friendly Doyle, a Democrat, unions agreed to no wage increase, furloughs and modest increases in payments toward health benefits -- in exchange for more say on overtime and other matters.

When Walker did put the concessions into the budget-repair bill in February 2011, it was scheduled to come to a vote within a week. Negotiations were a moot point.

The unions reacted by going public with statements offering to give Walker what he wanted on pensions and health if he would back off the collective bargaining limits. But it’s impossible to know how serious the offer was, or what would have happened if Walker decided to take it.

Our ruling

In a fundraising letter, Walker stated unions had rejected his push to pay more for pensions and health care.

The immediate reaction from labor was negative -- when Walker unveiled his plan in February 2011 but also when he broached the idea during the campaign and advanced it in the period before he took office.

But, soon after his concessions proposal was introduced, top labor leaders quickly said they could swallow the higher pension and health care contributions if Walker backed down on collective bargaining. What’s more, the portrayal of ""asking"" the unions rewrites history, leaving the misleading impression there was give and take with labor.

Walker’s office argued that the union statements and actions amounted to a refusal. But by that standard, later statements from those same leaders bowing to concessions would have to be taken into account as acceptance.

We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C8EF40>],/factchecks/2011/sep/16/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-says-he-asked-unions-concessions-/

U.S. Rep. Scott says jobs bill will save jobs of teachers, police, firefighters
","
Even before President Barack Obama officially submitted his jobs bill to Congress, U.S. Rep. David Scott took to the airwaves to sing its praises.

Obama’s $447 billion bid to push the economy out of the doldrums is just the thing for the middle class and poor, Scott said Sept. 9 in an interview for local National Public Radio affiliate WABE-FM (90.1). It would help the employed, the unemployed and small business to boot.

The bill would even spare the nation’s most beloved public servants from joblessness, Scott said.

""This is targeted so that no longer will states have to lay off teachers, and it’s specified in its language,"" Scott said. ""Teachers, firefighters, police officers -- people that we need.""  

Government would ""no longer"" have to lay off teachers, cops and firefighters? This sounded all too touchy-feely for the hardened skeptics of PolitiFact Georgia. Would the legislation create a U.S. Bureau of Rainbows and Unicorns, too?

We called Scott’s office for more information.

Michael Andel, his chief of staff, referred us to the language of the American Jobs Act of 2011, which was sent to Congress on Monday.

Sure enough, Title II, Subtitle B provides $30 billion for what it calls ""teacher stabilization."" As the bill says, its purpose is ""to provide funds to States to prevent teacher layoffs and support the creation of additional jobs in public early childhood, elementary, and secondary education in the 2011-2012 and 2012-2013 school years.""

Title II, Subtitle C provides $5 billion in ""First Responder Stabilization,"" which aims to save jobs for police officers and firefighters.    

This is how the bill would work, if it passes as written:

A state would receive money for teachers based on its population, the bill states. It may keep up to 2 percent of the cash for administrative costs and up to 10 percent for state-funded early learning programs. The rest would go to local districts, which would be required to use it for compensation, benefits and support services needed to keep employees or hire new ones.

The legislation bars districts from using the funds for other administrative purposes. States may not use the money to boost rainy-day funds or reduce debt, and they have to agree to keep their education spending at earlier levels.

Police departments would get their money directly from the U.S. attorney general. Fire departments would get theirs from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. These offices may use $10 million for administrative costs.  

The White House estimates that the bill, as written, would bring Georgians $956.7 million for up to 12,800 teachers, firefighters and police officers.

But does that mean that government will ""no longer"" have to lay off these public servants?

On this point, Scott oversold his claim. First of all, the bill funds teachers only for the next two years.

Second, it’s not clear to us that the money would be enough to prevent every teacher or officer from being pink-slipped.

Consider teachers. The White House estimates its bill could save or create about 390,000 education jobs across the nation over the two years, according PolitiFact Georgia’s calculations. Each of these jobs lasts one year.

It’s not clear whether this will save all the education jobs currently at risk. The White House estimates that 280,000 education jobs are at risk for fiscal year 2012. The American Association of School Administrators estimates that 227,000 school district jobs could be cut in the 2011-2012 school year.

We were unable to find estimates for education jobs at risk over the two years in which Obama’s bill is slated to create jobs, so whether they all could be saved is up in the air.

(Scott said that ""states"" won’t have to lay off teachers or first responders. These are typically local jobs, but we won’t penalize Scott for this misstep. State funds can help prop up local jobs, and the jobs plan passes money through the states.)   

Of course, the bill’s chances are far from assured. Even if it does pass, these provisions could be amended out of it. And state governors could decide to reject the cash.

In sum, Scott’s claim has strengths and weaknesses.  

The jobs legislation does set aside $35 billion for teachers, firefighters and police officers. And it does specify that the bulk of the money go to jobs, rather than administrative costs. This means that even though Scott overstated his claim, the bill is ""targeted,"" as he said, to keep these government employees from being laid off.

But the burden of proof is on Scott, and while the money could prevent many layoffs, there’s no hard evidence that governments would ""no longer"" have to let go of employees. His claim has accurate elements, but it’s overstated and could use more context.

We therefore rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973D3400>],/factchecks/2011/sep/16/david-scott/us-rep-scott-says-jobs-bill-will-save-jobs-teacher/

JCP&L says Hurricane Irene was second largest storm to hit continent in terms of power outages
","

When Hurricane Irene roared ashore last month in New Jersey and along parts of the East Coast, the storm killed people, destroyed homes, ruined belongings and caused unprecedented flooding.

It also left more than 7 million people in North America without power, according to Jersey Central Power and Light.

""In fact, Irene was the second-largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages – and the first hurricane to make landfall in New Jersey since 1904,"" according to an advertisement the company published in the Sept. 7 Star-Ledger.

PolitiFact New Jersey checked that statistic with a number of weather and energy experts, many of whom agree that Irene is one of the worst storms to hit North America. However, at least one organization puts the number of outages at 9 million.

First, let’s look at how JCP&L arrived at its statistic.

Spokesman Ron Morano said the company’s research was focused on the costliest and most destructive hurricanes – those affecting large population areas and multiple states. Among them: Hurricane Ike in 2008, which affected customers in 10 states and Canada; and Irene, which affected people in 14 states and the District of Columbia. Irene also entered Canada, but lost its tropical characteristics by the time it crossed the border, said Dennis Feltgen, spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami.

JCP&L reviewed a 2009 report by Jeff Masters, a meteorologist and co-founder of the Weather Underground website, that states Ike disrupted power to 7.5 million people. JCP&L also looked at utility reports, press releases from affected utility companies, information from the U.S. Department Of Energy, the National Weather Service, and news articles about Irene that supported data in Masters’ report, Morano said in an email.

Morano provided a list of 16 major utility companies along the East Coast that reported 7,070,000 power outages during Irene. More than 670,000 of JCP&L’s 1.1 million customers were among those without power. 
JCP&L struggled to restore service in Irene's aftermath, and some customers reported being without power for eight days. The company, in press releases, said delays in restoring power were caused by the volume of outages, the location of some problems and continued flooding. Partly because of JCP&L's storm response, public hearings are planned to discuss with the state's utility companies how to improve response for the next storm. 
""Based on the most recent information, Irene is all but certain to top 7.5 million customers affected,"" Morano wrote. ""Nothing in our research indicates a hurricane has impacted more than 7.5 million customers in North America.""

But figures still vary.

The Department of Energy’s Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability reported a high of 5.9 million customers with outages during Irene, but cautioned that its data does not include all utility companies. The same office reported a high of approximately 3.8 million outages for Ike.

A spokesman for the Washington, DC-based Edison Electric Institute said its outages tally for investor-owned electric companies is approximately 9 million. Municipal power companies and cooperatives are not included in that figure, said spokesman Dan Riedinger. The institute represents approximately 70 percent of the U.S. electric power industry.

Given the institute’s estimate – which is in line with figures reported by the Associated Press on Aug. 30 and Sept. 1 for communities from the Carolinas to Maine -- wouldn’t that make Irene, not Ike, the largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages?

""I’m 99 percent sure in terms of the storm that that is correct but we just can’t confirm it yet,"" Riedinger said.

Still, Ike’s ranking is a bit dubious. Since numerous agencies and experts we contacted said there’s no way to quantify an exact number of outages – and, therefore, rank them -- we asked Masters how he was able to do that for the 2009 report cited by JCP&L.

""All I did was go through the Wikipedia pages for every major hurricane power outage event of the past 40 years,"" he said in an email. ""Not authoritative at all. I put a plea on the post that if anyone knew of better sources of power outage data, they should contact me, but no one did.""

Wikipedia is an online database where anyone can enter or edit information on a particular subject, regardless of accuracy.

As for the other part of JCP&L’s statement, both David Robinson, New Jersey’s state climatologist, and Feltgen said the last hurricane before Irene to make landfall in New Jersey was in 1903 – not 1904, as JCP&L’s ad stated.

Our ruling

JCP&L says Hurricane Irene was the second-largest storm to hit North America in terms of power outages, with at least 7 million customers affected. Several experts we spoke with offer power outage ranges from 5.9 million to 9 million, noting that not every utility company is included in those estimates. Prior to Irene, Ike in 2008 reportedly caused 7.5 million outages, but some sourcing of that data comes from an online database with questionable accuracy issues. Still, JCP&L’s overall point about Irene being a major storm that caused millions to lose power is valid. We rate this claim Mostly True.

Eric Cantor blog post attacks Barack Obama for ""tax on soup kitchens""
","
Republicans portray President Barack Obama as an ineffective leader who has radically expanded government and done little to create jobs. And now, they say, he's out to hurt soup kitchens.

In a Sept. 14, 2011, blog post, the office of House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., took aim at one of the provisions of Obama’s jobs bill.

The post was headlined, ""President Obama's Tax On Soup Kitchens,"" and it criticized a tax provision included in Obama’s jobs bill.

""Yesterday, it was announced that an astounding one in six Americans are living in poverty,"" Cantor's blog post said. ""President Obama's response? To demand a tax on donations to soup kitchens and other charities that help people desperately in need. The president's proposal will impact approximately 40 percent of all the tax deductible contributions, and essentially penalize soup kitchens, hospitals, and churches that provide essential services to those who need them most. It’s no wonder this tax hike has been rejected on both sides of the aisle.""

We wondered if it was accurate for Cantor’s office to say that the jobs bill includes ""President Obama's tax on soup kitchens.""

First, we located the section in the jobs bill that Cantor’s office was using to back up its claim. It’s a tax provision designed to pay for the new expenditures and tax cuts that are supposed to spur job growth. Here’s the summary provided by the White House:

""This section would limit the value of all itemized deductions and certain other tax expenditures for high-income taxpayers by limiting the tax value of otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions to 28 percent. No taxpayer with adjusted gross income under $250,000 for married couples filing jointly (or $200,000 for single taxpayers) would be subject to this limitation. The limitation would affect itemized deductions and certain other tax expenditures that would otherwise reduce taxable income in the 36 or 39.6 percent tax brackets. A similar limitation also would apply under the alternative minimum tax. This section would be effective for taxable years beginning on or after January 1, 2013.""

In other words, this provision would generate income by limiting how much certain high-income taxpayers can deduct for charitable or other reasons.

Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, said soup kitchens theoretically would be affected if wealthy taxpayers cut back their donations because of the law.

""Limiting the tax savings on charitable contributions will reduce the amount that affected taxpayers give,"" Williams said. ""Some of what those folks give goes to soup kitchens. Affected soup kitchens will have less money to feed their clients, who will therefore be worse off.""

However, Williams added that the change is pretty modest. It would potentially affect only a tiny sliver of taxpayers -- about 2 percent of households. It’s not clear how much of a difference the limit on deductibility would mean for these taxpayers’ willingness to make charitable donations, either to charities generally or for soup kitchens specifically. And there’s no certainty that givers would cut their donations equally to all their charities.

That said, while the proposed deduction limit would potentially affect only a tiny fraction of taxpayers, the high-earning taxpayers who would get hit by it give disproportionately to charity -- not surprisingly, since they have the most disposable money to start with.

Statistics for the 2006 tax year showed that only 2.9 percent of filers reported adjusted gross incomes of at least $200,000. (Some joint households in this group do not earn enough to be affected by Obama’s proposal, but it’s the closest approximation in the data that we could get.) Yet despite the small size of this group, their itemized charitable donations accounted for 38.4 percent of all the itemized charitable donations made in the U.S. that year, by taxpayers from all income levels. So a tax hit to this group would likely hurt charitable giving more severely than a similarly structured tax hike on lower-income taxpayers.

But is it fair to call the provision in the jobs bill a ""tax on soup kitchens""? Clearly that's not what it is.

The government taxes many things -- cigarettes, gasoline, property, incomes. But it does not tax soup kitchens -- and would not start to do so under this bill. (Quite the contrary -- any soup kitchen that’s a charity is fully tax-exempt.) The proposal’s impact, then, is much more indirect -- it gives slightly less favorable tax treatment to charitable donations, a fraction of which may reach soup kitchens, for a small segment of the tax-paying population.

So the headline of the blog post is quite misleading. We also think the explanation in the text of the post, while more accurate than the headline, still goes too far when it says that Obama has acted to ""demand a tax on donations to soup kitchens and other charities that help people desperately in need."" Obama didn’t ""demand a tax"" on soup kitchens when he introduced the bill.

Brad Dayspring, a Cantor spokesman, said the point of the post was that ""eliminating a tax deduction for those who give to charities creates a new tax disincentive for that action, one that has otherwise not existed for a long-standing period of time. Bipartisan Members of Congress agree that this will have a negative effect on charities. … Soup kitchens are one such category of charities. … Ergo, President Obama introduced a new and negative tax treatment for soup kitchens (among others) this week. That is a fact.""

Our ruling

Cantor's blog post was headlined ""President Obama's tax on soup kitchens."" That is misleading in two important ways. First, Obama did not single out soup kitchens for special tax treatment. And second, the proposal is not a tax on soup kitchens, or any other charitable organizations; it effectively increases the existing tax burden on a small percentage of households, which may indirectly cause disincentives for donations to soup kitchens. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BE8480>],/factchecks/2011/sep/15/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-blog-post-attacks-barack-obama-tax-sou/

Sean Hannity says Barack Obama's jobs bill creates new avenue for unemployed to sue for discrimination
","During the Sept. 13, 2011, edition of Sean Hannity’s show on the Fox News Channel, Hannity said that President Barack Obama’s jobs bill included a new way for Americans to sue for discrimination.

In a discussion with former Florida State University football coach Bobby Bowden and Tucker Carlson, the editor of the Daily Caller, a conservative website, Hannity said that, under the bill, unemployed people would be able to sue for discrimination if they felt their status had kept them from getting a job.

""There is a class where they could sue the employer they've interviewed with because they were discriminated against, because they were unemployed,"" Hannity said. ""If I'm an employer and they implement that, I'm not going to interview anybody.""

Carlson added, ""There's a new category to the Civil Rights Act with race, ethnicity.""

Hannity continued, ""You can sue if you are unemployed and don't get the job and think you weren't hired because you are unemployed.""

Carlson replied that such a provision was a ""giveaway to the trial lawyers.""

""We've gone entitlement crazy,"" Bowden said.

""We have,"" Hannity agreed.

We were curious about whether Hannity described the proposal correctly. We began by turning to the bill itself.

The provision in question follows news reports that some companies have rejected unemployed job applicants out of hand as a way of filtering the large numbers of job resumes they’re receiving. In some cases, companies even made it clear in advertisements that they would not consider applicants who were unemployed.

Since unemployment levels have remained stuck for months at near post-Great Depression highs, such practices posed a challenge for an administration that desperately wants to boost employment. So the bill states the overarching position that ""denial of employment opportunities to individuals because of their status as unemployed is discriminatory.""

Specifically, the bill prohibits employers from publishing help-wanted ads that disqualify people who are unemployed, and bars employers from failing to consider or hire an individual ""because of the individual's status as unemployed."" The bill places similar restrictions on employment agencies.

As for enforcement of the new provision, the bill says that ""a court of the United States shall have the same jurisdiction and powers as the court has to enforce ... Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964"" -- the landmark provision that bans employment discrimination based on race, color, religion, sex and national origin.

An individual who seeks redress through the courts, the bill says, ""may be awarded, as appropriate"" an order to employers to stop the prohibited practices, ""reimbursement of costs expended as a result of the unlawful employment practice,"" damages up to $1,000 for each day of the violation, and ""reasonable attorney’s fees.""

Lynne Bernabei, a Washington employment lawyer best known for representing whistleblowers, agreed that Hannity described the law accurately, though she said that individuals suing under the new provisions -- if they are ultimately enacted as written -- will still face a steep climb in the courts before they secure any compensation.

""Any individual suing under this law has to prove that he was discriminated against because he was unemployed,"" Bernabei said. ""Discrimination is always difficult to prove, and it wouldn't be any easier to prove in this context.""

But Hannity didn’t suggest that plaintiffs would somehow be assured of winning in court; he simply said that they would have the opportunity to sue. We rate Hannity’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FB1B40>],/factchecks/2011/sep/15/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-says-barack-obamas-jobs-bill-creates-/

Alan Grayson says $360 million in taxpayer money went straight to Taliban
","
Democratic ex-congressman Alan Grayson is talking about the Taliban again. 
The first time -- when he not-so-subtly compared his opponent in the 2010 election to the Taliban -- didn't work so well. See, previous paragraph (i.e., ex). 
But Grayson is back, preparing to run for Congress after losing to Republican Dan Webster. 
In an e-mail to supporters (subject line: ""Iraq: I Did My Part"") on Sept. 1, 2011, Grayson wrote about the Commission on Wartime Contracting in Iraq and Afghanistan, which released its final report on prevalent waste and fraud among taxpayer-paid contractors in those countries. The bipartisan commission determined the U.S. government lost between $31 billion and $60 billion to waste and fraud as a result of ineffective oversight of contract spending. 
Grayson elaborated in his e-mail: ""In fact, $360 million of our tax dollars went straight to ... the Taliban. Wow. Who could have imagined that? Well ... me."" 
The rest of Grayson's note details how he revitalized a Civil War-era law that allows people to file lawsuits in the name of the federal government, a move that attracted attention from the New York Times, Washington Post, CNN and Wall Street Journal (he included links). He wrote that he voted against the wars, was a vocal opponent of them while in office and provided breakdowns of the war's toll on taxpayers. 
His point? He did something against the wars. 
But did he also make a false claim? Of all his figures, his statement that the United States sent $360 million ""straight to the Taliban"" was the most striking. 
It didn't take long to turn up what he was talking about. 
Grayson was referencing an Aug. 16, 2011, story by the Associated Press that preceded the commission's in-depth report. The AP reported that an investigation by a military task force found that $360 million in taxpayer money meant to strengthen Afghanistan's economy ended up going to ""the Taliban, criminals and power brokers with ties to both."" 
It happened through a process called ""reverse money laundering."" The AP explained it like this: American money starts out clean as it is given to companies hired by the military for transportation, construction, fuel and other projects. But the funds become ""tainted"" -- landing in the hands of crime groups and the Taliban -- either by direct payments or through the network of subcontractors. 
The Taliban and insurgent groups only reaped a ""small percentage"" of this $360 million, an anonymous Kabul-based military official told the AP. Most of the money was lost to profiteering, bribery and extortion by criminals and power brokers. 
About half of the lost money stemmed from a large transportation contract called Host Nation Trucking, comprised of eight prime companies that hired nearly three dozen subcontractors to transport supplies to U.S. troops in Afghan bases. Those subcontractors then paid off insurgents or warlords who control the roads. The task force found that one of the prime contractors, HEB International Logistics, made direct payments to ""malign actors,"" the designation given to the network of corrupt Afghan government and business officials, criminals and insurgents.  
The work of the military task force ran ""parallel"" with the research of the wartime contracting commission, commission spokesman Clark Irwin said.  But the military's findings have not been publicly made available (at least as far as we can tell). 
The wartime contracting commission's report, however, is a publicly available document. That report does not peg a specific dollar figure on moneys lost to the Taliban and other criminal groups. It notes, however, that extortion of U.S. transportation and construction project money is the second-largest source of revenue for insurgent groups, behind the drug trade (pages 73-4). 
From the report: ""In Iraq and Afghanistan, U.S. funds have been diverted to insurgents and warlords as a cost of doing business in the country. In Afghanistan, insurgents, warlords, or other groups control or contest parts of the country. They threaten to destroy projects and harm personnel. The Commission finds it particularly alarming that Afghan subcontractors on U.S.-funded convoys, road construction, and development projects pay insurgent groups for protection."" 
We asked the member of the commission who wrote that excerpt and an expert on the issue, University of Baltimore government contracting professor Charles Tiefer, for his opinion on Grayson's statement. There was no unclassified amount for money diverted to the Taliban until recently, Tiefer said, but the $360 million figure is credible based on information he gained while on a trip to Kandahar in March and the commission's conclusions. 
""That figure is consistent with it being the insurgent's second-largest funding source,"" he said, noting that finding a precise number would be nearly impossible. 
Tiefer went on to compliment Grayson, saying he ""was among the first lawyers to discuss publicly the scale of contracting waste in Iraq -- I never talked to him but I read what he had to say -- so, I think he has more right than most congressmen to pronounce on this issue."" 
Grayson, reached by e-mail, said he received further information on the subject from military briefings during his time in Congress, congressional delegation trips and several whistle-blower clients who worked for contractors in Afghanistan, ""none of which, unfortunately, I am allowed to share with you, except to say that the figure is corroborated,"" he wrote. 
Here's what we know: Grayson correctly quoted a figure from a national story about U.S. money being diverted to ""the Taliban, criminals and power brokers with ties to both."" A member of the Commission on Wartime Contracting -- and an expert in the field of government contracting -- found this information credible based on extensive research. 
But Grayson's statement comes with two minor caveats. He said that tax dollars went ""straight to ... the Taliban."" The process is actually more complicated and involved a type of money laundering. And the money went to bad actors other than the Taliban in some cases. Those are noteworthy clarifications and enough to rate Grayson's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D511C0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/15/alan-grayson/alan-grayson-says-360-million-taxpayer-dollars-wen/

Josh Mandel chides Sen. Sherrod Brown for out-of-state contributions
","
If you’re looking for fun with numbers (and who isn’t?), you could do a lot worse than download campaign finance data from the Federal Election Commission and sort it on a spreadsheet.

But you won’t have to. Josh Mandel’s campaign has done it for you. We’ve done it too, and can confirm that the Republican U.S. Senate candidate’s staff knows its stuff.

It also knows that Mandel got something wrong.

During an interview with WKYC in Cleveland on Sept. 1, Mandel was asked about some campaign contributions that have raised some eyebrows. The generous contributions were from employees of a Canton direct mail firm, Suarez Corporation. Bloggers, the Ohio Democratic Party and news reporters have asked how those employees could afford to write such campaign checks. There has been no proof that someone else actually provided the money, which would be illegal. But the unusual appearance has led reporters to ask questions..

Thus, the question to Mandel by WKYC reporter Tom Beres: What do you say to people who are disturbed by these contributions?

Mandel, who is currently Ohio’s treasurer, sidestepped the question, responding with a swipe at Sen. Sherrod Brown, the Democratic incumbent he hopes to defeat in 2012.

""Well, the majority last quarter of Sherrod Brown's campaign contributions came from outside of the state of Ohio,"" he said. ""The majority of ours, came from inside of the state of Ohio.""

That provoked a new question: Really?

There’s nothing improper about going out of state to raise campaign cash, unless an office holder is neglecting his duties. But while sidestepping the question, Mandel indirectly opened a new line of criticism: that Brown doesn’t have the faith of Ohio voters and contributors. The Mandel campaign says it intends to continue that line, saying it believes it is true.

But Mandel was wrong in his statement.

His spokesman, Joe Aquilino, shot us an e-mail while we were still sorting the data, saying, ""Josh misspoke and meant to say that the majority this year of Sherrod Brown's campaign contributions have come from outside the state of Ohio. (""last quarter"" vs ""this year""). We'll keep using this talking point and it's actually much worse than what Josh said during the interview. We'll be using this statistic a lot to show Senator Brown's lack of support from people here in Ohio who actually know him and know his record.""

This brings us to the numbers. We downloaded data from CQMoneyLine, a subscription service that sorts FEC data, and then turned to the original FEC records to do more crunching, factoring in itemized contributions (those of more than $200, which by law must list the donor’s name and address) and donations from political action committees. The Mandel campaign sent us its numbers, too, and they too came from an FEC download. The numbers matched.

They show that Mandel was wrong about the most recent quarter, which ended June 30. Brown got the majority of his contributions from Ohioans: $623,049 in state, compared with $609,506 out of state.

The previous quarter, however, more money came to Brown from out of state. Putting the two quarters together, the totals tipped the balance to the out-of-state side: $1,098,899 from Ohio, compared with $1,225,202 from out of state.

Does that make Mandel wrong in a narrow sense -- but right in a broader way? His campaign sees it that way.

Yet data that includes Brown’s current term but also goes back to his days in the House of Representatives, crunched on a regular basis by the Center for Responsive Politics for every member of Congress, shows that a majority of Brown’s donations have always been from Ohio.

That could change in the future, as it could for Mandel, who has only raised money during a single quarter so far in  this race (and the majority of his donations were from Ohio). Both candidates must raise millions more. Both will look for deep pockets throughout the United States.

But Mandel was wrong on his specific claim. And if adding in one more quarter renders him sort-of right, a long history involving years of Brown elections renders Mandel wrong.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Mandel’s statement is simply False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D66C80>],/factchecks/2011/sep/15/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-chides-sen-sherrod-brown-out-state-con/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Crime', 'Valerie Vainieri Huttle']","
Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle says 160,000 students stay home from school every day because they’re afraid of being bullied
","
Students dream up lots of reasons to skip school.

But tens of thousands of children are staying out of the classroom every day to avoid bullying, according to Assemblywoman Valerie Vainieri Huttle.

The Bergen County Democrat, a primary sponsor of an anti-bullying law that is being put into practice in New Jersey this school year, said those students need to feel safe.

""A hundred and sixty thousand kids stay home every day because they are afraid to go to school because of bullying,"" Vainieri Huttle said at a Sept. 6 news conference in Fort Lee. ""These are the kids that we are concerned with this morning. These are the kids that we need to give that message to this morning, that they will be protected.""

Vainieri Huttle repeated the statistic in an interview on NJTV that aired the same day as the news conference, but applied the number to New Jersey.

""And it certainly now is a mandate for all school districts to follow a course in anti-bullying and helping these kids get through those difficult years when, quite frankly, in New Jersey, there's like 160,000 kids that stay home from school each day because they're afraid to go to school,"" she said.

""Because of bullying?"" NJTV’s Joanna Caplan Gagis asked Vainieri Huttle.

""Because of bullying,"" Vainieri Huttle replied.

Vainieri Huttle’s spokeswoman, Andrea Katz, said the assemblywoman ""misspoke"" on NJTV. ""She meant the United States,"" Katz said.

Still, the statistic is questionable even on a national level.

Katz sent us several sources to support Vainieri Huttle’s claim, including a 2010 fact sheet from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and several other reports, news articles and websites.

""It’s a really commonly cited number,"" she said. ""It’s out there.""

And it is. A number of federal, state and local agencies have referenced the number, citing various organizations and individuals as the source.

Katherine Cowan, a spokeswoman for the National Association of School Psychologists, confirmed the number came from her organization, ""but nearly 20 years ago.""

""The statistic is extremely old and not valid in 2011,"" said Cowan. ""It’s one of those things that the media really loved and grabbed onto and took on a life of its own.""

Cowan said researchers calculated the number in the early 1990s from an annual survey conducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but did not have specifics on how the statistic was determined.

The CDC’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System survey, which has been conducted since 1991, asks high school students several health-related questions.

One survey question asks students if they did not go to school in the last 30 days because they felt unsafe at school or on their way to or from school.

A survey released in 2010 found 5 percent of high school students nationwide stayed home from school on at least one day for those reasons. But the question doesn’t ask why students felt unsafe, so the statistic could also apply to students who live in a high-crime neighborhood or fear crossing a dangerous intersection on their walk to school.

Though the statistic on students staying home because of bullying is no longer valid, Cowan said the impetus behind the fact -- that bullying has widespread implications -- is validated by a lot of research.

Deborah Temkin, research and policy coordinator for bullying prevention initiatives at the U.S. Department of Education, said her department recognizes the bullying statistic is ""likely not up to date.""

But, she said, ""there are quite a few students who stay home from school each and every day,"" because of bullying.

We found no other statistic that quantified the number of students who stay home because of bullying.

In response to our findings, Vainieri Huttle said, ""There is no doubt that harassment, intimidation, and bullying have a serious impact on the ability of New Jersey students to thrive academically and socially.""

Our ruling

Vainieri Huttle claimed that 160,000 students stay home every day because they are afraid of being bullied at school.

A spokeswoman for the National Association of School Psychologists confirmed her organization is the source of the statistic, but said the number is ""extremely old"" and ""not valid.""

Vainieri Huttle used the flawed -- though widely cited, even by the CDC in 2010 -- statistic to illustrate the impact of bullying. We don’t dispute that bullying is a serious concern, but Vainieri Huttle needs better numbers to prove her point.

We rate Vainieri Huttle’s claim Mostly False.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz downplays meaning in New York special election loss
","
Republican Bob Turner's stunning victory in a New York special congressional election on Sept. 13, 2011, has Democrats scrambling to offer explanations for their pre-presidential election year defeat.

The leading defense is that the result in New York's 9th district is an isolated event -- the combination of local issues, a less-than-strong Democratic candidate in David Weprin and the lingering baggage of the 9th District's former congressman, Anthony Weiner, who resigned after admitting to sending inappropriate messages to several women via Twitter and Facebook.

Party leaders also contend that the district -- which has been held by a Democrat since 1923 and where Democrats hold a 3 to 1 registration advantage -- apparently isn't that Democratic.

Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz offered the de facto Democratic rebuttal in interviews with the the Wall Street Journal and New York Times.

""It's a very difficult district for Democrats,"" the Journal quoted her as saying. The paper noted that Wasserman Schultz said the Democratic margins in the 9th tend to be the second lowest of all the districts in New York City.

In the Times, Wasserman Schultz said: ""In this district, there is a large number of people who went to the polls tonight who didn't support the president to begin with and don't support Democrats -- and it’s nothing more than that.""

We wanted to see if the New York 9th meets Wasserman Schultz's description -- or if we're the victim of spin.

The 9th Congressional District in New York includes parts of Queens and Brooklyn. The district has one of the heaviest concentrations of Jewish voters in the country. Here's how the 2010 Almanac of American Politics describes it:

""This is unquestionably a Democratic district, but conservative by New York City standards: It voted 67%-30% for Democrat Al Gore for president in 2000, but in 2004, after President George W. Bush's response to September 11, it gave Democrat John Kerry only 56%. It was the greatest swing of any congressional district in the nation that year. In 2008, Democrat Barack Obama won with 55%-44% over Republican John McCain. Obama lost the Brooklyn portion of the district 57%-42%.""

The numbers provide a good overview of the district. Here's some more things to consider:
  

Some of those Weiner numbers can be explained, in part, by the power of incumbency. But Weiner is a Democrat -- as was now-Sen. Charles Schumer, who served in the 9th before Weiner.

Reading back what Wasserman Schultz said

We have two instances of Wasserman Schultz downplaying the results in the 9th by suggesting that the district isn't as Democratic as it sounds.

In the Journal piece, she said ""It's a very difficult district for Democrats."" That's a silly claim on its face -- based on the performance of candidates in that district. However, the Journal's quote includes a note that leads us to believe she may be talking about being ""very difficult"" only relative to other New York City congressional districts.

So for this fact-check, we're zeroing in on her comments to the Times, where she said: ""In this district, there is a large number of people who went to the polls tonight who didn't support the president to begin with and don't support Democrats -- and it's nothing more than that.""

This quote, too, has some nuance -- namely because she said that there were a ""large"" number of people who went to the polls opposing Obama and Democrats. You could say that of any election in any district.

And another problem is knowing who went to the polls. We haven't seen any exit polling and haven't spoken to anyone who has.

We asked pollsters and political science professors who had been following the special election and know the district to analyze Wasserman Schultz's statement. Most agreed that while the district shouldn't be confused with liberal districts in California, Massachusetts or other places, it is a Democratic district. They also generally agreed that the district's voters have turned more against Obama since they helped elect him in 2008 -- which would negate Wasserman Schultz's assertion that people didn't support Obama ""to begin with.""

""She's correct that the president is very unpopular in that district -- 31 percent approval to 56 percent disapproval,"" said Democratic pollster Tom Jensen. ""However that hasn't always been the case -- he won 55 percent of the vote there in 2008. So yes a lot of the people who voted Republican just did so because they don't like the president -- but it should be a major cause of concern for Democrats that there are so many voters who fall into that category in a district where he did quite well his first time up for election.""

Christopher Malone, a political science professor at Pace University in New York, said anecdotal evidence is strong that Obama Democrats in 2008 have since abandoned ship and voted for Turner in 2011.

""There were many voters that came out to vote against Obama that probably have stayed home in the past because they knew their vote was wasted (for example, in 2008 when McCain was sure to lose New York state),"" Malone said. ""On the other hand, it is also clear that many Democrats who supported Obama have become disenchanted with him and either stayed home or switched their vote and went with Turner. I can’t give you figures right now because I’ve not seen exit polls. But this is what I’ve seen leading up to the race from conversations with people on the ground and from other reports.""

Republican pollster John Diez, who polled the district ahead of the special election, said polling data clearly showed that opinions about the president have changed since 2008.

""The fact is that between the 2008 election results and recent survey data, President Obama, the leader of the Democrat Party and the architect of the Democrat policies, has become increasing less popular. His declining job approval is not only driving turnout, but voting decisions among voters who supported him in 2008,"" Diez said.

And then there's the end of Wasserman Schultz's claim -- that the results were ""nothing more than"" the people voting for Turner who didn't vote for Obama or Democrats. Douglas Muzzio, professor of public affairs at Baruch College in New York, took umbrage with that characterization.

""'Nothing more than that' -- gimme a break,"" Muzzio said in an e-mail. ""Far more than an anomaly, a local screw-up.""

Brad Woodhouse, communications director for the DNC, said he was unsure what people could object to in Wasserman Schultz's remarks. ""I don't see how that statement could be in dispute,"" he said. ""We lost the race so it stands to reason that the people who showed up are unlikely to be supporters of the president.""

Our ruling

Wasserman Schultz defended the defeat of a Democratic candidate in New York's 9th Congressional District by saying that ""there is a large number of people who went to the polls tonight who didn't support the president to begin with and don't support Democrats -- and it's nothing more than that."" 
In a low turnout election, where about 60,000 people voted (compared to about 200,000 in 2008), and based on the fact that a Democrat lost and a Republican won -- there's no doubt that there's some truth to the statement. 
But there are a few problems with Wasserman Schultz's characterization. First, despite who voted there has been a shift in the popularity of Obama in the 9th District -- where 55 percent voted for him in 2008 but only 31 percent approve of him today. That undercuts her claim that people who went to the polls didn't support the president to begin with.

And the historical trends show that the 9th district has largely and consistently been a Democratic district. 
A more complete picture might emerge when and if exit polls are released, but for for now Wasserman Schultz's claim has holes in it. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CE68C0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/14/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-downplays-meaning-new-yor/

Ron Paul says U.S. has military personnel in 130 nations and 900 overseas bases
","During the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas -- a staunch advocate of limited government and a more modest military footprint -- offered a surprising statistic about the reach of the U.S. armed forces.

""We're under great threat, because we occupy so many countries,"" Paul said. ""We're in 130 countries. We have 900 bases around the world. We're going broke. The purpose of al-Qaida was to attack us, invite us over there, where they can target us. And they have been doing it. They have more attacks against us and the American interests per month than occurred in all the years before 9/11, but we're there occupying their land. And if we think that we can do that and not have retaliation, we're kidding ourselves. We have to be honest with ourselves. What would we do if another country, say, China, did to us what we do to all those countries over there?""

That statement includes a lot of different claims, but we’re going to focus on just one of them here that a reader asked us to check -- that the U.S. military ""is in 130 countries. We have 900 bases around the world.""

We’ll split this into two parts -- checking whether the U.S. military has personnel in 130 countries, and whether the U.S. has 900 overseas military bases.

Personnel

For the personnel question, we turned to a Sept. 30, 2010, Pentagon document titled, ""Active Duty Military Personnel Strengths by Regional Area and by Country.""

We tallied up all the countries with at least one member of the U.S. military, excluding those with personnel deemed to be ""afloat."" We found U.S. military personnel on the ground in a whopping 148 countries -- even more than Paul had said. (There are varying standards for what constitutes a ""country,"" so that may explain the divergence from Paul’s number.)

However, we should add a caveat. In 56 of these 148 countries, the U.S. has less than 10 active-duty personnel present. These include such obscure locales as Mongolia, Nepal, Gabon, Togo and Suriname.

By contrast, the U.S. has disclosed only 13 countries outside the United States and its possessions that are host to more than 1,000 personnel. They are: Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain, Turkey, the United Kingdom, Japan, Bahrain, Djibouti, South Korea, Iraq, Afghanistan and Kuwait.

In addition, this is a snapshot of the global military footprint, so it may not include all temporary training missions and humanitarian assistance activities. ""Such activities are so pervasive you almost have to wonder how the other 70 countries manage to avoid hosting such operations,"" said John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, a national security think tank.

Bases

For this question, we turned to an official Pentagon accounting of U.S. military bases around the nation and the world, the ""Base Structure Report, Fiscal 2010 Baseline.""

According to this report, the U.S. has 662 overseas bases in 38 foreign countries, which is a smaller number than the 900 bases Paul cited. But here again, the list omits several nations integral to active operations in Iraq and Afghanistan, so it’s conceivable that the actual number of sites approaches 900.

The Pentagon ""is very reluctant to label anything a ‘base’ because of the negative political connotations associated with it,"" said Alexander Cooley, a political scientist at Barnard College and Columbia University who studies overseas bases. ""Some of these facilities, such as the Manas Transit Center in Kyrgyzstan, may not be officially counted as ‘bases,’ but it is the most important U.S. facility in central Asia, staging every U.S. soldier transiting in and out of Afghanistan and conducting refueling operations.""

Still, caveats are in order here, too. Of the 662 overseas sites listed -- that is, those outside the active war zones -- all but 32 of them are either small sites (with a replacement value of less than $915 million) or sites essentially owned on paper only.

For instance, the sole site listed for Canada is 144 square feet of leased space -- equal to a 12-foot-by-12-foot room. That’s an extreme case, but other nations on the list -- such as Aruba, Iceland, Indonesia, Kenya, Norway and Peru -- have just a few U.S. military buildings, many of them leased. Some of the sites are unmanned radio relay towers or other minor facilities. ""Most of them are a couple of acres with a cyclone fence and no troops,"" Pike said.

Cooley said that the ""true figure is tough to determine and involves judgment calls about the nature and purpose"" of the activities involved. ""The fact that host countries often choose not to disclose a U.S. military presence adds to perceptions of a ‘secret network’ "" that is larger than the officially disclosed number of bases.

Our ruling Given the incomplete figures available from the Pentagon, Paul’s topline figures -- 130 nations, 900 bases -- are plausible when active military operations are included. ""My eyebrows were raised many times"" during the debate, Pike said, but this comment ""was not one of those times."" Still, we think it’s worth pointing out that many of the personnel deployments and facilities included in Paul’s number are fairly minimal in nature. On balance, we rate Paul’s statement Mostly True.

Ron Paul says under Rick Perry, government jobs grew by 170,000 in Texas
","
With the polls now showing Rick Perry ahead for the Republican nomination, his opponents are trying to undercut his claims of soaring job growth while he's been governor of Texas.
   
During the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, sought to put some blemishes on Perry’s record by noting that many of the new jobs were in the government.
   
CNN anchor Wolf Blitzer, the debate moderator, began the exchange by asking Paul about Perry’s claims of economic success in the Lone Star State. ""You’re from Texas,"" Blitzer said. ""Does your governor deserve all that credit?""
   
Paul answered, ""Not quite. I’m a taxpayer there. My taxes have gone up. Our taxes have doubled since he’s been in office. Our spending has gone up double. Our debt has gone up nearly triple. So, no. And 170,000 of the jobs were government jobs. So I would put a little damper on this, but I don’t want to offend the governor, because he might raise my taxes or something.""
   
For this item, we’re looking exclusively at Paul’s claim that ""170,000 of the jobs"" created in Texas under Perry ""were government jobs.""
   
We turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal source of employment data for the nation, states and localities. We looked at government job growth during Perry’s tenure, from January 2001 to July 2011:
   
State government jobs: Increase of 49,100, or about 4,600 per year of Perry’s tenure
Local government jobs: Increase of 217,600, or about 20,700 per year
Federal government jobs: Increase of 19,700, or about 1,900 per year
   
Total government jobs: Increase of 286,400, or about 27,300 per year
   
Meanwhile, Texas employment overall increased over this period by 1,078,600, or about 102,700 per year.

Looking at it a different way, the number of local government jobs has increased by 21 percent during Perry’s tenure, while state government jobs have expanded at a 15 percent clip.

Let's put all of this in perspective. The increase in state government jobs represented about 4 percent of Texas’ total jobs increase; for local government jobs, it was 20 percent; for federal jobs, it was less than 2 percent.
   
We see a few different ways to analyze these numbers.
   
First, in critiquing Perry, not all government jobs are created equal. Perry has the most direct influence over the growth in state jobs. His influence on local government jobs is weaker. And he has relatively little influence in securing federal job increases. (Indeed, given his theme that the feds are overreaching, he might very well want fewer federal employees.)

How big is Perry’s sway over local government jobs? We checked with representatives of cities and counties, and they agreed that it is pretty limited.

Cities get about 36 percent of their funds from property taxes, 29 percent from sales taxes and much of the rest from items such as fines, right-of-way rentals and user fees, said Bennett Sandlin, executive director of the Texas Municipal League, which represents 1,100 Texas cities. Those sorts of income streams are not affected by the governor to any significant degree.

Counties, similarly, are ""highly reliant on the property tax,"" said Elna Christopher, a spokeswoman for the Texas Association of Counties. She said that state mandates can affect county employment numbers, particularly because a jail standards commission sets required ratios between prison inmates and correctional-officers. But while the governor appoints the commissioners, he doesn’t directly influence their deliberations.

This leaves one major area: the public schools. The state government does have significant influence over education budgets -- and most recently, this impact has been to shrink rather than increase. Earlier this year, Perry and the legislature decided to fund school districts by $4 billion less in 2012-13 than existing formulas would have provided. 
And during Perry’s tenure, local education jobs -- which Perry would have the most influence over -- have increased at a slower rate than local government jobs as a whole. Local education jobs have risen at about 11 percent, while non-educational local government jobs have risen by 37 percent.

So with the government jobs Perry can affect the most -- state jobs -- the raw-number increase was well below what Paul claimed. Only if you use a more expansive definition of government jobs -- including jobs Perry doesn’t have much of an impact on -- is the increase bigger than what Paul claimed.

Having said that, the increase in total government jobs under Perry is not trivial. State government jobs represented 4 percent of the overall increase for all types of jobs, but the combination of all government jobs accounted for nearly 27 percent. And if you look at government jobs as a percentage of all jobs in Texas, the share has risen from 16.4 percent at the start of Perry’s tenure to 17.5 percent today.
   
And here’s one more factor to consider: As state and local government jobs were increasing, so was the state's population -- more rapidly than anywhere in the nation.
   
Between mid 2001 and mid 2010, Texas’ population increased by a whopping 20 percent. The growth in local government jobs -- 21 percent -- roughly kept pace with that growth, while state government jobs increased at a somewhat slower pace, 15 percent.
   
Both growth rates were faster than the national average. Nationally, local and state government jobs both grew by slightly under 6 percent during the same period.
   
Our ruling
   
We can’t find an exact match for Paul’s 170,000 figure in the official statistics, and getting to that number requires not just state jobs, but also local government jobs that Perry would have had difficulty influencing.
   
Still, there's some truth in Paul’s underlying claim that a notable share of the job growth Perry touts on the campaign trail came from government jobs. Even leaving out federal jobs, about one out of every four new jobs in Texas during Perry’s tenure has been a new state or local government job. So while Paul is wrong on the specific numbers, he makes a larger point with some merit. We’ll call it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097015E80>],/factchecks/2011/sep/14/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-under-rick-perry-government-jobs-gre/
"['State Budget', 'Texas', 'Keep Conservatives United']","
Pro-Bachmann group says Texas spending has doubled under Rick Perry as governor
","
A group favoring U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota for president posted an ad online this month suggesting Gov. Rick Perry, the leading hopeful for the Republican presidential nomination, isn’t a fiscal conservative.

In the spot, targeted at South Carolina voters, the narrator says Perry ""doubled state spending in a decade.""

That claim by the Keep Conservatives United super PAC immediately rang a bell with us. In August 2010, Texas Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White said the state budget had gone up over 80 percent under Perry, the governor since late 2000. We rated White’s statement Mostly True. Between 2000-01 and 2010-11, spending from all sources including federal and local aid increased nearly 79 percent, from nearly $101.8 billion to almost $182.2 billion.

Then again, we noted, there are ways to analyze the increase that whittle the growth percentage.

Adjusted for population growth and inflation, spending increased 18.2 percent over the period. Also, expenditures of state general revenue — the money most directly influenced by legislators and the governor — decreased by 4.5 percent, according to the state’s advisory Legislative Budget Board.

The pro-Bachmann group offers as backup for its claim data from two comprehensive annual financial reports issued by the Texas state comptroller’s office which account for state finances in accord with standards set by the Governmental Accounting Standards Board. Counting spending from general revenue (basically state tax dollars), special revenue (meaning income restricted to specific programs), capital projects and debt service, the reports show spending of nearly $45 billion in the fiscal year that ended Aug. 31, 2000, and $90.4 billion in the year that ended Aug. 31, 2010, — an increase of nearly 101 percent.

So, there’s a way to stake the ""doubling"" claim.

We wondered how spending looks based on the actual state budgets adopted on Perry’s watch.

At our inquiry, budget board staff provided revised figures for 2000 through 2010 and added information from the 2011 budget year and 2012-13 state budget that Perry signed into law in June. Interestingly, the 2000-01 and 2010-11 expenditures from all sources have changed since our 2010 fact check; the updated figures indicate an 86 percent increase in raw spending over the period, which drops to 22 percent if adjusted for population growth and inflation.

Between 2000 and 2010, the years singled out by the pro-Bachmann group, spending from all sources increased 86 percent, or 21 percent adjusted for inflation and population growth, according to the board’s figures. Spending from state general revenue rose 44 percent, though that was actually down 6 percent in 2010 from 2000 when adjusted for inflation and population growth — as noted in a Sept. 1, 2011, Perry campaign email challenging the ad.

When we delved into spending growth for our 2010 fact check, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, suggested that any comparison of the 2000-01 budget and the 2010-11 budget take into account two factors in the latter budget that weren't at play in 2000-01.
   
First, Perry and state lawmakers agreed several years ago to cover reductions in school property taxes with state revenue; that's costing $14 billion in the 2010-11 budget. Craymer said that commitment doesn't translate to an increase in government spending; it's a shift in which level of government is doing the spending. Second, the 2010-11 budget included about $12 billion in one-time federal stimulus aid. Remove the combined $26 billion out of the comparison and the state budget increase since 2000-01 falls to 53 percent.

In a recent follow-up interview, Craymer stuck with his 2010 caveats. He also cautioned against reaching conclusions based on the state’s annual financial reports which, he said, have to account for far more than actual spending in a fiscal year. He said the best source for comparisons of spending under any governor would be the state budgets they signed into law as tracked by the budget board.

In an interview, Billy Hamilton, the state’s former deputy comptroller, aired a similar view, noting that major debt decisions reflected in the financial reports were approved directly by voters in amendments to the state constitution. Those reach the ballot without the governor having a say.

Researcher Bob Harris, the pro-Bachmann group’s treasurer, told us in an interview: ""I wanted to get the whole picture ... This was the comprehensive report.""

R.J. DeSilva, spokesman for the comptroller’s office, said by email the report each year ""aggregates the state's assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses and presents a broader accounting scope that includes more than the allocation of general revenue funds through the state's budgeting process. For example, accounting principles dictate the depreciation of
a state vehicle has to be shown as part of expenses in the (report), although it is non-cash activity which is not included in the budget process.""

Asked to elaborate, DeSilva replied: ""Another example would be higher-education spending of local funds (like tuition revenue). That spending is included in the (report), but it’s not part of
budget appropriations by the Legislature.""

All told, we can see the appeal of using a financial report with ""comprehensive"" in its title. And
the financial reports, piling in all kinds of spending factors, seemingly back up the ""doubling"" claim.

However, we’re not convinced the reports are the best way to check spending under gubernatorial sway. It’s why we tend to hew to figures in the state’s budgets.

And according to the latest updates of budgeted spending, spending from all sources increased 86 percent over the years analyzed by the group, 21 percent once population growth and inflation are counted. Budgeted spending the governormost affected, of state general revenue, went up 44 percent, though that decreased 6 percent once inflation and population growth are weighed.

We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097015400>],/factchecks/2011/sep/14/keep-conservatives-united/pro-bachmann-group-says-texas-spending-has-doubled/

Mitt Romney and the dog on the car roof: one columnist's obsession
","Gail Collins loves telling the story of how Mitt Romney drove his family to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car -- and telling it, and telling it, and telling it.

The liberal New York Times columnist has mentioned the incident in print 19 times, by our count. She devoted a column to the incident in 2007 when Romney first ran for president. In another column, she suggested John McCain pick Romney for his running mate ""so I can repeatedly revisit the time Mitt drove to Canada with the family dog on the station-wagon roof."" And when Sarah Palin was picked instead, and Collins opined that ""unlike Mitt Romney, she has never gone on vacation with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car.""

Collins regularly includes the incident in jocular news quizzes she writes. (A typical question: Which Republican hopeful ""continued to fail to explain why he drove to Canada with the family dog strapped to the roof of the car?"" Mitt Romney.) She complained that his 2010 campaign book No Apology didn't mention it, calling it ""a critical oversight."" Last year, just in time for the holidays, she suggested someone make ""a tasteful Mitt Romney Christmas Ornament"" depicting the scene of the dog on the roof. 

And just last week, she noted that the issue wasn't discussed during the Republican debate at the Ronald Reagan Library. Romney's top rival, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, reportedly shot a coyote that was threatening his daughter's dog, which made the Romney anecdote relevant. ""His puppy-rescue is a stirring picture, especially considering that Perry's chief competitor is the man who drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car.""

Aside from wondering why Collins is so obsessed with the story, we also wondered: Is it true?

We reached Collins to ask her why she liked the story so much, but she said she'd rather let her columns speak for themselves.  (See a picture of Seamus here.) The story of Seamus the Irish setter is not an Internet rumor. It first appeared in the august pages of the Boston Globe in 2007, when the paper published a seven-part profile of Romney, a former Massachusetts governor who had just launched a presidential run. 

The story of Seamus kicked off Day Four, a story about Romney's family life, written by Globe reporters Neil Swidey and Stephanie Ebbert.

It begins in 1983 with a 36-year-old Mitt Romney carefully packing up his five sons and luggage into the family station wagon for a 12-hour trip from Boston to Ontario, where his parents had a cottage on Lake Huron. At the time, Romney was a successful young consultant with Bain & Company, but he hadn't yet started buying and selling companies with Bain Capital in the private equity field.

""As with most ventures in his life, he had left little to chance, mapping out the route and planning each stop. ... Before beginning the drive, Mitt Romney put Seamus, the family's hulking Irish setter, in a dog carrier and attached it to the station wagon's roof rack. ""

Cruel? It's not presented that way in the story, which noted Romney built a special windshield for the carrier, ""to make the ride more comfortable for the dog.""

But Seamus must not have been all that comfortable, because he began to experience, um, gastric distress. 

From the story: 

As the oldest son, Tagg Romney commandeered the way-back of the wagon, keeping his eyes fixed out the rear window, where he glimpsed the first sign of trouble. ''Dad!'' he yelled. ''Gross!'' A brown liquid was dripping down the back window, payback from an Irish setter who'd been riding on the roof in the wind for hours.

As the rest of the boys joined in the howls of disgust, Romney coolly pulled off the highway and into a service station. There, he borrowed a hose, washed down Seamus and the car, then hopped back onto the highway. It was a tiny preview of a trait he would grow famous for in business: emotion-free crisis management.

As the story quickly made its way around the Internet, Romney loathers -- and dog lovers -- had a field day. 

The liberal blog Wonkette said it showed Romney would be a great commander-in-chief for the notorious Iraq prison Abu Ghraib. David Kravitz of the liberal blog Blue Mass Group called it ""nuts"" and ""classic Romney: it solves a problem efficiently, in a business-like manner, and with no regard whatsoever for the suffering that the solution may cause."" Ingrid Newkirk of People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals told Time's Ana Marie Cox that Romney was giving his children ""a lesson in cruelty"" and that dogs under extreme stress might lose control of their bowels. ""That alone should have been sufficient indication that the dog was, basically, being tortured,"" she said. Cox explored whether Romney's actions might have been illegal under animal cruelty laws. (A moot point, because the statute of limitations has long expired.) As to the accuracy of the story, the Globe learned of the incident from friends of the family and confirmed the details with the Romney family. And the candidate himself didn't dispute the report. In fact, in the days following, he defended it. Seamus loved riding in the carrier, Romney told reporters on the campaign trail in 2007. 

""He scrambled up there every time we went on trips,"" Romney said. ""He got (up) all by himself and enjoyed it."" He also said PETA had targeted him because there was a rodeo at the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, and because he went quail hunting in Georgia. ""And they're not happy that my dog likes fresh air,"" he added. Actually, Seamus had been dead -- of natural, non-station wagon-related causes -- for years when the story appeared. (He had retired to California to live with Romney's sister, who had more space.) We didn't get answers about Seamus from the Romney campaign, but from Neil Swidey, the Boston Globe reporter who unearthed the story.  Swidey said he chose the incident to begin his story because he thought it would resonate with readers as an illustration of Romney's approach to solving problems -- trip is interrupted by dog poop, so Romney pulls over, borrows a hose, takes care of the problem, and is back on his way.  ""I certainly didn't write it to make it the basis on which you judge a presidential candidate. The fact that some people appear to be doing that is a little bit crazy. But I can understand why it resonates with people,"" Swidey said. ""It's a window into how this guy operates."" Swidey said some people see it as evidence of Romney's heartlessness, while others see him as logical man and a problem solver.

He confirmed the impression we got from reading the story, that the incident was amusing family lore, and that none of the Romney family was upset or disturbed by the dog riding on the roof. In fact, some of the Romneys said they thought the dog actually liked riding on the roof. (Finally, lest we be accused of utter frivolousness, we asked Swidey what aspects of Romney's biography might be more relevant to voters considering Romney for president. He pointed us toward the Globe's coverage of Romney's business career in private equity, his time as governor and Romney's relationship with his father George, who ran for president himself back in 1968.) 

Here, we're ruling on Collins' statement that Romney ""drove to Canada with the family dog Seamus strapped to the roof of the car."" It's important to note that the dog was not literally strapped to the car, as in tied around its midsection. Rather, Seamus was in a carrier with a protective windscreen that Romney had built. The dog's diarrhea might indicate that something was amiss, but Romney's family didn't seem bothered by it. The anecdote is presented in the Globe as funny family story, not as evidence of Romney's barbaric cruelty. We rate Collins' statement Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809757A180>],/factchecks/2011/sep/13/gail-collins/mitt-romney-and-dog-car-roof-one-columnists-obsess/

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says tax rates lowest since the 1950s for wealthy Americans
","
Before the Republican candidates for president took center stage in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011, for the CNN/Tea Party Express debate, Democratic National Committee chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz talked with CNN's Wolf Blitzer about the state of President Barack Obama's jobs bill.

Wasserman Schultz was in Florida to counter the argument being made by many Republicans that since the stimulus didn't work, Obama's jobs bill won't either.

In the middle of Wasserman Schultz's back-and-forth with Blitzer, the two had a disagreement about some tax figures. Blitzer tried to make the point that wealthy Americans might already pay their fair share while Wasserman Schultz countered that their tax rates are the lowest they've been since the 1950s.

Here's the transcript of the conversation:

BLITZER: You're here with a lot of Republicans here. You're a Democrat. We will talk politics in a moment. But do you think the Republican leadership in the House, Eric Cantor, John Boehner, they're serious when they say they're willing to compromise, willing to work with the president on this jobs bill? They hate some of it, but they're willing to accept some other parts?

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, I'm concerned that they're only willing to take up and consider the parts that are part of their record of supporting allowing the fox to guard the henhouse, focusing only on deregulation of business and not making sure that we can balance the investment, as well as the tax breaks, like the payroll tax. So I would like to take them at their word.

BLITZER: From the White House perspective, it is not a take-it-or-leave-it $447 billion package. They're willing to negotiate, to compromise from the White House. Is that right?

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Oh, sure. From Day 1, President Obama has been willing to negotiate. We really haven't had willing partners on the other side. I'm certainly hopeful that the Republican leadership is willing to negotiate. But so far, they seem to only indicate that they will take up whatever it is they support and toss it back...

BLITZER: But you shouldn't be overly surprised. They never want to increase taxes. And the president's plan is based in part at least on increasing taxes on wealthier Americans.

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: Well, you're right. The Republicans continue to refuse to ask for anything from the wealthiest and most fortunate Americans, to pay their fair share. They continue to want to pile all the pain on the backs of people who can least afford it, on the middle class, on small business owners, even though the overwhelming (number) of American people want there to be revenue and want there to be a balance between spending cuts and revenue.

BLITZER: All right, we don't have to debate the whole issue of taxes and wealthy and all of that. (But) the wealthiest Americans, they pay the most in taxes already -- 50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax, because...

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: No, that's actually not true, Wolf.

BLITZER: Fifty percent, you don't...

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: We're at the low -- in terms of the wealthiest Americans, we're at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s.

BLITZER: I know, but they pay a huge chunk of the federal income tax, the wealthiest Americans. The top 2 percent or 3 percent pay whatever that number is, 30 or 40 percent.

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: But they're still at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s.

BLITZER: Yes, 35 percent.

WASSERMAN SCHULTZ: And there have been significant tax breaks from President Obama.

BLITZER: All right. We're not going to get into all of that.

Blitzer decided to cut off the debate there; at PolitiFact, we're happy to continue.

In a previous item, we measured Wasserman Schultz's assertion that Blitzer was wrong to say that ""50 percent of Americans don't even pay any federal income tax."" Blitzer had his numbers right, so we ruled Wasserman Schutlz's claim False.

In this fact-check, we're examining Wasserman Schultz's claim that the wealthiest Americans have the lowest comparative ""tax rate since the 1950s.""

PolitiFact has heard a take on this claim before -- from President Barack Obama.

During negotiations on an agreement to raise the debt ceiling, Obama was asked at a press conference whether tax increases should be a part of a deal to approve a new debt ceiling.

""You can't reduce the deficit to the levels that it needs to be reduced without having some revenue in the mix,"" Obama said on June 29, 2011. ""The revenue we're talking about isn't coming out of the pockets of middle-class families that are struggling -- it's coming out of folks who are doing extraordinarily well and who are enjoying the lowest tax rates since before I was born. If you're a -- if you are a wealthy CEO or a … hedge fund manager in America right now, your taxes are lower than they have ever been. They're lower than they've been since the 1950s.""

The most basic way to address this question is to use the highest marginal rates for ordinary income -- what's commonly called the ""top tax bracket."" This rate -- which today is 35 percent -- is applied to any money earned above a certain threshold. For 2011, that level is $379,150 for married couples filing jointly, for individuals and for heads of households, and $189,575 for married couples filing separately.

Between 1960 and the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan pushed through landmark tax cuts, top tax brackets had much higher rates than those in place today. For instance, the top rate was 91 percent in 1960 and 70 percent on the eve of Reagan’s election in 1980.

By 1988, the top federal income tax rate fell to 28 percent, and it stayed there until 1990. It ticked up to 31 percent for 1991 and 1992, before rising to 39.6 percent in 1993.

So, for five tax years -- 1988 through 1992 -- the top tax bracket had a lower rate than today’s top bracket. Put another way, out of 52 tax years since 1960, the top tax rate was lower than today’s only 10 percent of the time. (Today's top tax bracket has been steady since 2003, so in nine additional tax years, the earlier bracket was tied with today's.)

In considering Obama's statement we also looked at trying to measure the effective tax rate (as in what a typical taxpayer actually pays after deductions, exemptions and the like.)

We won't go through the complicated analysis again -- you can read it here if you like. Suffice it to say, effective tax rates for high-earning Americans are either at their lowest level since 1960 or at least very close to their lowest level.

As for Wasserman Schultz, she said: ""In terms of the wealthiest Americans, we're at the lowest tax rate since the 1950s."" Since 1960 the top marginal income tax rates -- the most common way to measure Wasserman Schultz's statement -- were lower only between 1988 and 1992 than they are today. With that caveat, we rate her claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973CA900>],/factchecks/2011/sep/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-tax-rates-lowest-195/

Hightower says Perry slashed budget of volunteer fire department reducing ability to fight wildfires
","Liberal pundit Jim Hightower, the former Texas agriculture commissioner who lost that post to then-state Rep. Rick Perry in 1990, doesn’t think much of Perry as governor—including, Hightower says, his budgeting for volunteer firefighters.

Appearing on MSNBC on Sept. 6, 2011, Hightower said Perry’s ""own state officials"" say wildfires ravaging the state were inevitable due to hot dry, windy conditions and because ""Perry, with his Republican supermajority in the Legislature, managed to slash the budget of the volunteer fire departments in our state by 75 percent in the last legislative session.""

Hightower shortly added: ""People's homes are burning down because of his failure to stand up, not today ... but months ago, and indeed a couple of years ago, to fund our firefighting capability so that we could stand up to this.""

Readers brought Hightower’s comment to our attention just as we were reviewing a similar claim by liberal commentator Thom Hartmann, who wrote in a Sept. 7, 2011, blog post on the TruthOut website that Perry ""cut his state’s volunteer firefighter program by 75%—reducing funding from $30 million down to $7 million for the critical program to prevent wildfires.""

Granted, the wildfires have been widespread, destroying homes and taking lives. But did Perry and the Republican-controlled Legislature knock down funding to volunteer fire departments and did that reduction hamper the response to recent wildfires?

To back up his claim, Hightower’s office pointed us to a Sept. 7, 2011, National Review blog post and a March 23, 2011, news report by Austin’s KVUE-TV, both mentioning legislated cuts to a state fund that helps volunteer fire departments purchase clothing, equipment and training. The cuts took effect Sept. 1, 2011, the start of the new fiscal year.

To learn more, we called the Texas Forest Service, the agency responsible for protecting the state’s forests and related natural resources and preventing and putting out wildfires.

In an interview, Robby DeWitt, who administers financial operations for the service, told us that counting employee benefits, the agency was appropriated $83 million for 2012-13, down from $117.7 million in 2010-11, a 30 percent drop. DeWitt said the forest service did not ask lawmakers to maintain its previous funding, since state leaders, facing a multi-billion-dollar revenue shortfall, had instructed all agencies to tighten belts.

In a handout, though, the forest service notes that it can request additional money to cover its firefighting bills; indeed, the 2011 Legislature approved $121 million to pay the costs of fighting fires earlier this year and in previous years.

""Given the ongoing, severe drought and fire season, TFS will have to request additional funding for fire bills during the next legislative session,"" the handout says. The next regular session is in 2013, though the governor can call a special session before then.

Among the agency's legislated cuts: A reduction in grants for volunteer fire departments from $23.25 million a year in 2010-11 to $7 million in 2012-13. According to the agency, the grants help provide equipment and training to volunteer fire departments. That money will be prioritized now, the agency says, to cover training, protective equipment and clothing. As of Aug. 12, 2011, nearly $155 million in grants had been awarded over the years to cover or help cover the cost of training, emergency fire equipment, trucks, tankers, communications systems and computers. Another 24,000 grant requests, seeking nearly $340 million total, were on file.

The cut will have an impact, the handout says, with grants for large equipment put on hold ""until funding can be restored (hopefully during the next legislative session)."" The remainder of the service’s overall budget reductions ""will result in less agency equipment replacements, reductions to operating budgets and"" the elimination of any vacant positions, the agency says, while the service ""will continue to fight wildland fires and the budget cuts will not hinder our response.""

Perry effectively agreed to a 70 percent reduction in grants—not 75 percent—when he signed the state budget into law in June.

Still, we wondered if the budgets of volunteer fire departments were socked as a result.

Seems not.

In an interview, Don Galloway, a forest service policy and planning analyst, said volunteer fire departments operate independently from state government, depending on local funding to cover operating costs. Local departments are the first responders to wildfires, he said, with the state enlisted if necessary; the state requests federal help if that’s needed.

The grants that got whittled did not and do not cover the operating costs of any volunteer fire department, Galloway said.

Finally, we wondered how volunteer fire departments view the grants’ cut.

Chris Barron, executive director of the State Firemen’s & Fire Marshals’ Association of Texas, whose members include volunteer fire departments, said in an interview that the association was happy lawmakers approved the $7 million a year for the grants at a time huge cuts hit other state-backed entities.

Barron, who is the chief of the Manchaca Volunteer Fire Department, agreed that legislators don’t appropriate money to fund volunteer fire departments, which mostly rely on local sources including donations. He followed up by email, saying there is ""not a reliable/constant source of funding for most of the volunteer fire service of Texas.""

So, Barron said, the state grants help volunteer fire departments stay afloat by helping them pay for training and equipment that they would be hard-pressed to cover by themselves.

Upshot: Hightower’s statement, suggesting Republican legislators slashed the budgets of fire departments on the front lines of the wildfires, misrepresents the cuts in state grant funding for equipment and training as if they were a direct cut to volunteer fire departments. The state doesn’t fund the operating costs of local departments.

It’s also incorrect to conclude that the cut to the grants’ fund hampered any department’s effort to combat recent wildfires; the reduction just took effect.

"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Dan Ramos']","
State Rep. Dan Ramos says loopholes the GOP left in Ohio's tax laws cost $7 billion a year
","
In a newspaper opinion piece published last month, Ohio Rep. Dan Ramos said Gov. John Kasich and the General Assembly needlessly neglected the state's needs through their approach to balancing the budget.

""Gov. Kasich and the Republican-dominated legislature have foregone the popular option of closing tax loopholes that amount to $7 billion annually in this state, choosing instead to balance the budget entirely by selling public assets, cutting local funds and eliminating thousands of jobs,"" the Lorain Democrat wrote.

That drew the attention of PolitiFact Ohio. Loopholes and tax breaks are usually mentioned in relation to federal taxes, not those at the state level. And $7 billion almost equals the deficit that was projected as lawmakers worked on the state budget for 2012-13.

We asked how Ramos came up with that figure. His office referred us to two sources: a report by Policy Matters Ohio, a liberal think tank, and the Tax Expenditure Report prepared by the Ohio Department of Taxation.

The Tax Expenditure Report is issued as a companion to the governor's executive budget. It looks at the impact of tax expenditures, which are the credits, deductions and exemptions in the tax code that reduce the amount of revenue the state would otherwise receive.

""Tax expenditures result in a loss of tax revenue to state government, thereby reducing the funds available for other government programs,"" the report says. ""In essence, a tax expenditure has the same fiscal impact as a direct government expenditure.""

But ""unlike direct budgetary expenditures, unless there is a pre-existing termination date, tax expenditures may remain in effect indefinitely with little or no scrutiny by policy makers.""

This year’s report estimated that the credits and exemptions will amount to more than $7 billion in foregone revenue in both fiscal years 2012 and 2013. The report counts 128 tax expenditures -- an increase from 122 in the previous two-year budget.

While estimating their dollar value, the report offers no conclusions about the worth and validity of the tax expenditures. That's the responsibility of the General Assembly and the governor, although -- as the report noted -- no continuing or periodic review is required.

Lawmakers supporting the tax credits and exemptions say they are most often intended to spur economic development.

Policy Matters Ohio proposed in its report that the General Assembly set a target of reducing tax expenditures by 10 percent.

""We're not saying that you can just get rid of them all,"" the group's research director, Zach Schiller, told us.

Some, he noted, are exemptions valued by the public, such as one that exempts purchases of prescription drugs from sales tax.

""But you can cut sizable amounts,"" he said.

For example, he noted, a cap on the sales tax paid by buyers of shares in jet aircraft is estimated to be worth $1 million. And retailers who collect the state sales tax get a discount on what they collect, if they send in the tax by the due date of the tax return, a windfall for big retailers.

""But the $7 billion doesn't cover everything by a long shot,"" Schiller said, because the Tax Expenditure Report counts only items that would have been taxable if not specifically exempted. While the sales tax covers the sale of all goods that haven't been exempted, it covers only services that are specifically named.

""Hiring a lobbyist, for example, does not involve paying sales tax because it wasn't written into the law,"" Schiller said. ""To me, that's a tax break,"" even though it does not count as foregone revenue.

Three years ago, Policy Matters Ohio listed ""a dozen tax breaks Ohio can do without."" noting that payday lenders and mortgage brokers were given a lower state tax rate than banks; that debt collectors, like lobbyists, don't have to bill clients for sales tax, and that a measure approved by the General Assembly made it easier for high-income individuals who spend part of the year out of state to avoid Ohio income tax.

Just those tax breaks cost the state more than $65 million a year, the group said.

Let's get back to the statement we questioned: ""Gov. Kasich and the Republican-dominated legislature have foregone the popular option of closing tax loopholes that amount to $7 billion annually in this state.""

Ramos was accurate in writing that tax exemptions and credits amount to $7 billion a year in Ohio -- though referring to them as ""loopholes"" adds a negative connotation that is not uniformly justified.

We found that this year's budget process increased the number of tax expenditures, rather than limiting them.

But we think it is important to note that even critics of the tax breaks don't recommend cutting all of them -- a point that helps provide clarification. Limiting tax breaks, in other words, is not an either-or option to increasing revenues or cutting spending in balancing the budget.

On the Truth-O-Meter, a statement that is accurate but needs clarification rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C24EEC0>],/factchecks/2011/sep/13/dan-ramos/state-rep-dan-ramos-says-loopholes-gop-left-ohios-/
