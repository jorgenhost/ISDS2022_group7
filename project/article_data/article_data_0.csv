Hurt amiss in blaming estate tax for sales of family farms and businesses
","U.S. Rep. Robert Hurt full-heartedly joined his Republican House colleagues recently in their near unanimous vote to end the estate tax. ""The death tax causes serious problems for family farmers and small business owners who want to have their children and grandchildren continue their life’s work,"" Hurt, who represents the rural 5th Congressional District, said in a statement posted to his website on  April 16. ""In many cases, this excessive and duplicative tax forces them to sell the farm or business just to pay these punitive taxes, keeping them from passing down the culmination of their lifetime of work to the next generation."" We wondered whether Hurt was accurate in saying that the tax, ""in many cases,"" forces the heirs of family farms and small businesses to pull up stakes. Many Republicans -- including other members of Virginia’s congressional delegation and House Speaker John Boehner -- made similar statements after the voted repeal vote. Republicans voted 233-3 for the legislation. Democrats opposed it, 176-7. The measure is expected to be filibustered by Senate Democrats, many of whom say the repeal of the tax -- which brings in almost $22 billion a year -- benefits only the wealthy. We asked Hurt’s press secretary, Abigail Sigler, for the sources of the congressman’s claim. She pointed to three reports published over the years by the Joint Economic Committee. The latest report, issued in 2012 by Republicans on the panel, said ""the estate tax remains a burden to family business,"" but offered no data about the number and farms and businesses that were sold because of the levy. The two other studies, issued in 1998 and 2006, also lacked hard information on liquidation sales and have become archaic. That’s because the estate tax was much steeper in the past than it is today. In 1998, for example, the levy kicked in on estates worth $625,000 from individuals and $1.25 million from couples. Assets at that level or above were taxed at rates up to 55 percent. Today, the federal levy affects estates worth $5.43 million or more from individuals and at least $10.86 million from couples.The tax rate can be as high as 40 percent, although most estates pay considerably less because of deductions available to heirs. The average tax rate rate in 2013 was 16.6 percent, according to a computations of IRS data by the nonpartisan Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. Few families are wealthy enough to be bothered by the estate tax. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in March that 5,400 people will leave taxable estates this year -- about one in every 500 people who dies, or two-tenths of one percent. The Tax Policy Center, in its 2013 study, came up with an even smaller number: It estimated 3,780 people would leave taxable estates that year. That was roughly one of every 660 people who died. Of those high-end estates, half had some farm or business assets. The researchers drilled down further to separate the estates of wealthy people with diverse portfolios from those whose holdings centered on a farm or business. They concluded that there were only 120 taxable estates in the nation where half of the value or more came from a single farm or business operation. Next, the researchers honed in on how many of those estates belonged to small family farmers and businessmen. So they narrowed their focus to taxable estates worth no more than $10 million with less than half of the assets held in a farm or business. Under that formula, the center concluded that about 20 small farms and businesses across the nation were added to federal estate tax rolls in 2013. ""They’re the exception, not the rule,"" said Roberton Williams, an economist with the center. Alan Viard, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who specializes in federal tax and budget policies, dismissed arguments that the estate tax is killing family farms and small businesses. He said the research by the Tax Center is solid and noted that heirs can take up to 14 years to pay off inheritance tax debts. Viard favors repeal of the estate tax because he believes it discourages saving. He told us the focus on small farms and businesses ""is a weak argument against the estate tax that distracts from better reasons to repeal it,"" he said. There’s one more study we should point out. The U.S. Department of Agriculture concluded last year that 99.4 percent of estates with farms in 2013 were not subject to the so-called death tax. Hurt, as we noted earlier, has lots of company in linking the estate tax to family farms and small businesses. We evaluated Hurt’s statement because it was the strongest made by a Virginia congressman. But we wanted to share these comments made by other Republicans in the state delegation: Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th ""Instead of taxing businesses and farms out of existence, repealing the death tax will help to create and maintain jobs."" April 16 written statement. Rep. Dave Brat, R-7th ""And it’s not just the super wealthy who are affected. It’s also small business owners and farmers whose wealth may not be in cash and stocks, but in the value of their land and equipment."" April 17 written statement. Rep. Morgan Griffith, R-9th ""I am proud today to have voted to repeal the federal death tax policy, and will continue fighting to grow our economy and protect American families, farms, and small businesses."" April 16 written statement. Rep. Barbara Comstock, R-10th ""Imagine building up a family business or family farm your whole life only to lose much of that business upon the death of Mom or Dad.  Under current law, Uncle Sam swoops in and can take up to 40 percent of what you spent a lifetime building up for your children and grandchildren.  Today we voted to stop that injustice."" April 16 written statement. Our ruling In arguing for the repeal of the federal estate tax, Hurt says the levy ""in many cases"" forces family farmers and small businesses owners to sell their holdings instead of passing them down. He presents no statistics --  or specific examples -- on liquidations under the federal estate tax structure that went into effect in 2011. The estate tax kicks in on individual assets worth at least $5.43 million and joint holdings of $10.86 million. Hurt ignores a body of research showing a tiny portion of deceased people -- only two tenths of 1 percent, according to a Congressional report -- leave estates that are subject to the tax. The U.S. Department of Agriculture estimates only 6 tenths of 1 percent of estates with farms qualified for the tax in 2013. The nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that there were 20 small, closely held farms and businesses that were subject to the tax that year. It’s unknown how many of them, if any at all, were sold to pay the levy. So Hurt’s statement comes up empty. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C36E7C0>],/factchecks/2015/may/03/robert-hurt/hurt-amiss-linking-estate-tax-small-farm-businesse/
"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Nuclear', 'Marco Rubio']","
Do Iran and the United States disagree on the nuclear deal framework?
","How can the United States and Iran come to a deal on Iran’s nuclear program when the two countries can’t even agree on what they supposedly agreed to? That’s the point presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. -- a vocal critic of the negotiations -- made on National Public Radio April 13. ""I still have tremendous questions about whether this deal's even viable,"" he said. ""The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things."" President Barack Obama and the other negotiating parties -- Iran, China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom and Germany -- hit a milestone in early April. They established a framework agreement that lays the foundations for a final deal, to be reached in the summer. So we wondered: Are the United States and Iran’s descriptions of what the deal will entail so different? It’s important to keep in mind that the agreement reached in Lausanne, Switzerland, was a framework, not a final deal. The framework itself isn’t publicly available, and the parties still have plenty of details to hammer out. For these reasons, there’s room for the negotiating parties to fill in the blanks with details that appeal to constituents. Even so, some of the differences between the United States’ and Iran’s descriptions of the agreement are significant -- such as the timeline for sanctions relief and how much access international inspectors will have to Iran’s nuclear facilities. Back in April, Iran and the United States decided to set these differences aside, hoping to successfully address them later, said Matthew Kroenig, a professor at Georgetown University and an expert in nuclear weapons policy. ""These differences are important, however, and could very well kill the deal,"" Kroenig said. Officials in both countries have said the other’s descriptions run counter to what was decided in Lausanne, and if they can’t agree, the potential for a deal might die. Iranian Minister of Foreign Affairs Mohammed Javad Zarif tweeted and said on Iranian television that the American factsheet was ""in contradiction"" to the framework agreement, according to the New York Times. Responding to a question about Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei’s pushback against the deal, Obama told reporters April 11, ""If that is his understanding and his position -- in ways that can't be squared with our concern about being able to embark on vigorous inspections to assure that Iran isn't cheating under any program, and that we don't have the capacity to snap back sanctions when we see a potential violation -- then we're probably not going to get a deal."" Significant discrepancies We reached out to Rubio’s team and didn’t hear back. But Iran and the United States have each produced factsheets about the agreement, in addition to a joint statement from the negotiating parties. If you want to look at the details yourself, Harvard University’s Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs put together a side-by-side comparison of all three fact sheets and relevant political statements. A major discrepancy between Iran and the United States is the timeline and conditions for pulling back sanctions against Iran. According to the American factsheet, the United States and European Union will ""suspend"" sanctions against Iran after it has been verified that Iran is complying with the deal. The sanctions can ""snap back"" into place if it is discovered that Iran is not complying. Iran’s summary, on the other hand, says the sanctions will be ""revoked"" as soon as the deal is implemented -- distinguishing a permanent change from the ability to reinstate sanctions. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani said April 4, ""During the talks we (both sides) always talked about lifting economic, financial, and banking sanctions. We never talked about the suspension of the sanctions, and if that were the case, no agreement would form."" Additionally, Obama said the sanctions relief would be ""phased in,"" while Rouhani said the sanctions would be canceled on the ""very first day of the implementation of the deal."" Another point of contention is the level of access international inspectors will have to Iran’s nuclear facilities. The American factsheet has several bullet points emphasizing that the International Atomic Energy Agency’s inspectors will have near universal access to Iranian nuclear facilities. Obama called it ""unprecedented,"" noting that Iran will also be required to grant access to the material supply chain in addition to the facilities themselves.   Iran’s summary of the framework says much less about verification processes. It says Iran will comply with some of the agency’s protocols ""on a voluntary and temporary basis."" Additionally, Iran’s religious leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said international inspectors will not have unlimited access to nuclear facilities. ""It must absolutely not be allowed for them to infiltrate into the country’s defense and security domain under the pretext of inspections,"" Khamenei said, as reported by the Wall Street Journal. While the discrepancies over sanctions and levels of verification are important, others are a just matter of spin, said Graham Allison, director of Harvard’s Belfer Center and a nuclear weapons analyst. For example, regarding one of Iran’s uranium enrichment facilities, the United States factsheet says, ""Almost two-thirds of Fordow’s centrifuges and infrastructure will be removed."" Iran’s factsheet, on the other hand says, ""More than 1,000 centrifuge machines and all related infrastructure in Fordow will be preserved and maintained."" Both descriptions are accurate -- Fordow currently has 2,710 centrifuges, and the deal will lower that number to 1,044. While the differences in the public descriptions may be striking, Allison said people should not pass judgment on the final deal yet, given that the real negotiations are conducted in private, meaning the real contents of the deal are private, too. ""Poisonous political divides in both Washington and Tehran mean that a host of commentators and even journalists seize on, and even exaggerate, these differences for their own political ends,"" Allison said. Our ruling Rubio said, ""The Iranians are now saying that what we're saying the deal is and what they understand it to be are two different things."" Leaders in Iran and the United States are both accusing the other of distorting the framework agreement reached in April -- and there are some dramatic and significant differences in the way the two countries are describing aspects of the agreement. It’s important to keep in mind that the agreement is not the final deal, and many details have yet to be solidified. But Obama and experts have said some of the differences that have surfaced, if unresolved, could kill the final deal. We rate Rubio’s claim True. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union. Thanks to all who contributed.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C360700>],/factchecks/2015/may/01/marco-rubio/iran-united-states-disagree-nuclear-deal-framework/

Studio plan jobs claim misleading
","Atlanta officials say they are likely only weeks away from closing the deal on the largest business investment to take place on Atlanta’s southside in decades. By mid-May, they hope to make official the sale of 330 acres at the Army’s former Fort McPherson to actor and filmmaker Tyler Perry. Perry, a multimillionaire and long-term Atlanta resident, is ready to pay $30 million for the property, which he plans to redevelop into a television and film studio. According to the city, he has already invested about $200 million in various entertainment ventures in Georgia, most notably Tyler Perry Studios in southwest Atlanta. The new studio, which is forecast to take about two years to construct, is expected to attract additional investment in the area and expand Atlanta's footprint in television and film, Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed has said. The project could mean ""over 8,000 new jobs, including the relocation of 350 jobs,"" according a city press on Aug. 8, 2014, announcing tentative agreement between Perry and a government agency overseeing the post’s redevelopment.   That 8.000 jobs forecast has been repeated frequently and  across all media platforms and has sometimes been attributed to Reed. The mayor, however, has parsed his words more carefully, saying the project will create ""hundreds"" of jobs and has the potential to enhance the area culturally and economically. PolitiFact decided the projections warranted a closer look. We contacted Brian Hooker, executive director of the McPherson Implementing Local Redevelopment Authority. He told us the often-touted employment figure was formulated based on data from Perry’s organization. The Army, he said, wanted to assess how the proposed studio would affect vehicle traffic around the post, which closed in 2011. The job numbers, developed in July 2014, assume that between 10 and 20 productions will be in the works at the studio all times. Each production involves 200 to 300 skilled union and nonunion workers, as well as the talent (the on-screen folks and those you and I would consider the stars). Jobs at the studio could range from a low of 3,900 to a high of 8,300, according to the calculations. The vast majority -- 2,000 to 6,000 -- involve contract work related to the productions. A production usually takes an average of four to five months, Hooker said. The second biggest pool of workers   -- between 500 to 1,500 -- will be temporary jobs building the studio. The actual number of full-time jobs is estimated at between 400 and 800, with the bulk of those -- 300 to 500 -- being members of the professional and executive staff overseeing daily operations at the studio, Hooker said. It’s not clear exactly how many of those executive staff employees will be true new hires. That’s because the permanent employees of the current Tyler Perry Studios, about 350, are expected to move to McPherson. (Tyler Perry Studios executives have not shared their plans for the existing studio facilities, Hooker said.) Between 100 to 300 workers, categorized as ""operations labor,"" also will be full time. They will be responsible for assisting set designers and others who come to the studio as part of the various productions, Hooker said. Our conclusion: Tyler Perry plans to develop a major television and film studio at the former site of Fort McPherson, providing a major boost to the community and to Georgia’s growing film industry. The project has been forecast to create about 8,000 jobs, including some in construction. That’s based on a report, which we examined that shows a potential range of jobs from 3,900 to 8,300. At best only about 800 of those are expected to be permanent jobs. Most of them are in contract work. That’s important and missing context that doesn’t diminish the project but shortchanges the reader. The overall statement from the city is partially accurate, but misleading. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C360A40>],/factchecks/2015/may/01/city-atlanta/Studio-plan-jobs-claim-misleading/

Did lawmakers who voted to keep defense-surplus program for police get 73% more in defense cash?
","The recent unrest in Baltimore following the death of an African-American man who’d been taken into police custody has gotten people debating on social media, questioning the role of the federal government in militarizing local police. A reader asked us to check a meme on this topic that recently entered their social media feed. ""The U.S. representatives that voted to keep militarizing the police received 73 percent more campaign money from the defense industry,"" the meme reads. It accompanies an image of a phalanx of helmeted police with guns raised at a suspect whose hands are raised in surrender. The meme was created by represent.us, which was founded in 2012 and describes itself as ""building a fiercely nonpartisan movement to pass tough anti-corruption laws in cities and states across America."" Its board members range include former Louisiana Gov. Buddy Roemer, GOP strategist Mark McKinnon, former disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Harvard law professor Lawrence Lessig and D.C.-based think tanker Norm Ornstein. We thought the meme merited a closer look. Checking the number The source of the statistical claim was not hard to find. It originated with a study done using an online tool created by MapLight, a website that tracks and analyzes money in politics. The study looked at how lawmakers voted on an amendment to the Department of Defense Appropriations Act of 2015 (H.R. 4870) that would have prohibited the use of funds to transfer various types of surplus military vehicles and gear to local and state police forces through a Pentagon program established in the late 1990s known as the 1033 program. The amendment in question was offered by Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., on June 19, 2014. It failed by a vote of 62-355, but the MapLight study found some interesting statistics. The study tallied up all of the donations to lawmakers from the defense industry between Jan. 1, 2011, and Dec. 31, 2013, using seven categories of industrial sectors tracked by the Center for Responsive Politics. It determined that lawmakers who voted against the amendment took in $53,153 from defense-related donors, while those who voted in favor of the amendment took in $31,240 from those same industries. That means the ""no"" voters received 70 percent more in defense donations than did the ""yes"" voters. That’s slightly off from the 73 percent cited in the meme, but it’s pretty close. (We found an older article on Maplight that said ""73 percent""; MapLight staff told us the difference likely arose when a legislator returned a contribution, and the data automatically updated.) So the number is close to the mark. But what about the significance of this finding? This is less certain. What does the connection actually mean? As we noted, the 1033 program gives surplus military goods to local and state law enforcement, so it’s not obvious how the defense industry would benefit from a vote to keep the 1033 program alive. The industry sells its goods only to the Pentagon; the 1033 program doesn’t open up a pipeline for the industry to sell its products to local law enforcement. Nor does the industry get a cut of the transaction with state and local police forces. Some experts told PolitiFact that they don’t see how the defense industry would have a dog in this particular fight. ""There is no reason to think that defense contractors benefit from the 1033 program,"" said Benjamin H. Friedman, a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""The transfer of military goods to local or state authorities is quite unlikely to affect what the Pentagon orders in the first place."" Friedman called the connection ""likely spurious."" Brent Skorup, who has studied the issue for the free-market Mercatus Center at George Mason University, said that while the meme ""seems to imply that lobbying dollars buys votes … the causation is pretty complicated, and I think the implication is overblown."" Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments, agreed that the link was likely ""tenuous."" ""It is possible that defense companies could profit by selling spare parts for that equipment to state and local governments,"" he said. ""If the Defense Department simply destroyed the equipment, the companies would have a smaller market for (original equipment-manufacturer) parts, in theory. But a lot of the equipment being transferred doesn’t seem like it would have the potential for high-priced, high-volume spare parts. I don’t see much of a connection here."" A spokesman for Represent.us, Mansur Gidfar, disagreed. He said the existence of the 1033 program indirectly benefits the defense industry because it allows the Pentagon to err on the larger side when making orders. ""The Pentagon may not be ordering more than they need intentionally, but I have to imagine ‘we're passing these resources on to communities that need them to keep the streets safe’ is a much more palatable talking point than ‘we ordered too much and now they're sitting in a warehouse,’ "" Gidfar said. In addition, at least one armored-vehicle contractor -- Lenco Industries, which sells to both the military and domestic law enforcement market -- advertises federal grant-writing classes to police, which suggests that suppliers take an interest in such legislation. Vehicles initially obtained through the 1033 program may hook police forces on their products and spur direct purchases further down the road. Given the uncertainties, Gidfar said that his group was careful when creating the meme to highlight the correlation between defense-industry dollars and voting -- not a causal relationship. Indeed, several experts noted that it may be an independent variable -- the lawmaker’s philosophical or ideological affinity for a strong military and aggressive policing -- that could account for both the larger acceptance of defense-industry money and a ""no"" vote on the amendment. Ultimately, ""it is up to citizens to decide whether or not money played a role in how their legislator voted,"" said Pamela Behrsin, MapLight’s vice president of communications and a contributor to the original study. Our ruling The group Represent.us created a meme that read, ""The U.S. Representatives that voted to keep militarizing the police received 73 percent more campaign money from the defense industry"" than did the representatives who voted to stop it. The correct number is actually 70 percent, which is close to what the meme said. But it’s worth noting there's significant doubt about how meaningful this connection is. Several independent experts said it’s not obvious that the defense industry would have a strong self-interest in supporting the continued existence of the program, and if they don’t, that would undercut the meme’s underlying message. Others say defense contractors do have a small but real interest in seeing that police get the equipment. Overall, the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True. Correction: This article has been changed to reflect that Maplight's data on campaign contributions automatically updates. We initially reported that a numerical difference was due to mistaken typing. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280971D7AC0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/30/representus/did-lawmakers-who-voted-keep-defense-surplus-progr/
"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'State Budget', 'Florida', 'Steve Crisafulli']","
Crisafulli says 257,000 would be 'forced into Medicaid' under expansion
","Even before the Florida House adjourned early, Speaker Steve Crisafulli laid blame for the session’s budget impasse clearly on Medicaid expansion. In an essay printed by the Tampa Bay Times, Crisafulli wrote the Senate had ""partnered with the Obama administration"" to demand the expansion. But the House believed the move would drag people into a costly system that didn’t work. ""Under federal law, other low-income Floridians have access to health care subsidies to buy private insurance for less than the average cost of a wireless phone bill,"" said Crisafulli, R-Merritt Island. ""In fact, if we choose Obamacare expansion, 600,000 will lose eligibility for their subsidies, of which 257,000 would be forced into Medicaid. "" Estimates say the expansion would cover more than 800,000 people, many of whom are currently uninsured. We wondered where Crisafulli was getting his numbers. Playing percentages This subject can make heads spin pretty easily, so before we begin, let’s review a few basics about the Affordable Care Act. The law’s intent was to expand coverage to the uninsured through two different ways. The first was to give subsidies to people who needed help to buy insurance through HealthCare.gov or a new state marketplace. The second way was to expand Medicaid, a state-federal insurance program for the very poor. Medicaid expansion ended up being optional for the states, thanks to a 2012 Supreme Court ruling. This is what the Florida House and Senate are arguing about. The Senate wants to expand Medicaid so that recipients end up buying heavily subsidized insurance. The House doesn’t want to expand Medicaid at all. Crisafulli’s numbers are based on how many Floridians would qualify for the expansion, which would be extended to all adults up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level (100 percent is currently $11,770 for an individual and $24,250 for a family of four). Technically the calculation is actually 133 percent under the law, but a 5 percent deduction is added on top of that. If a state doesn’t expand Medicaid, people who make 100 to 400 percent of the poverty level can get subsidies to buy insurance in a marketplace. These are the subsidies Crisafulli is talking about. But if you qualify for Medicaid, you’re not eligible for help paying premiums. His argument is that if the state extends the program, the people between 100 and 133 percent of the federal poverty level (he’s not citing the full 138, you’ll note) will lose their subsidies to buy policies, and the House simply won’t let that happen. Crisafulli is using 2015-16 fiscal year estimates by the Florida Office of Economic and Demographic Research, which we examined ourselves. That projection says there are about 609,000 people in the 100 to 133 percent of poverty level range, and a little more than 351,000 of them have insurance of some kind. They get it through employers, Medicare or some other form of government assistance program, or buy insurance on their own (subsidized or not). Those people could enroll in Medicaid if they wanted to. More than 257,000 have no insurance at all, and these are the ones Crisafulli is saying will be ""forced into Medicaid."" His office confirmed he meant they will be left without subsidies and will not make enough money to buy policies, so Medicaid will be their only option. What it means The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and health policy experts largely agreed the numbers were plausible, but there are some points they said Crisafulli is sidestepping. Foremost is the idea that 257,000 people would be ""forced"" to join the program. There is no law that says you have to use Medicaid if you qualify, and not everyone who is currently eligible enrolls. Ben Sommers, a health policy and economics professor at Harvard, said it’s pretty tough for Crisafulli to imply those quarter-million people would be upset by suddenly qualifying for Medicaid. ""Giving uninsured people Medicaid is pretty popular among uninsured people,"" Sommers said. ""There aren’t any public opinion surveys I’ve seen in which low-income adults don’t generally support the Medicaid expansion."" Crisafulli neglects to mention there are many Floridians who right now don’t qualify for either Medicaid or federal subsidies, an estimated 669,000 people whose income is below 100 percent of federal poverty level. Those uninsured Floridians account for 18 percent of all Americans in the so-called coverage gap -- second only to Texas. They would all benefit from Medicaid expansion by gaining coverage. Finally, Crisafulli is arguing that expanding Medicaid under Obamacare would unfairly take away subsidies that Floridians need to buy their own insurance. Those subsidies are a feature of the very same Affordable Care Act he criticizes. Our ruling Crisafulli said, ""If we choose Obamacare expansion, 600,000 will lose eligibility for their subsidies, of which 257,000 would be forced into Medicaid."" Crisafulli is using incendiary language to describe state projections about Medicaid expansion. The state estimates that about 609,000 Floridians would lose access to subsidies to buy insurance under an expansion. About 257,000 of those people would be uninsured, likely because they’re too poor to buy their own. The rest could enroll in Medicaid if they wanted to. So his numbers can be considered accurate. But experts tell us saying those people would be forced into the program isn’t accurate. Many of the very poor would likely see becoming eligible for Medicaid as a benefit.  We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BF2DC0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/30/steve-crisafulli/crisafulli-says-257000-would-be-forced-medicaid-un/

Killer was on street after serving 2 years of 13-year robbery sentence, Sheriff David Clarke says
","Although his department’s primary activity is running two jails and patrolling freeways, not fighting crime on the streets, Milwaukee County Sheriff David A. Clarke Jr. frequently speaks out nationally on policing, and often in a critical way. Most recently, he made multiple appearances on Fox News to talk about rioting in Baltimore that followed the death of Freddie Gray, a black man who died of a spinal-cord injury that he suffered while in police custody. Clarke blasted Baltimore’s mayor for not responding more forcefully to the violence. Local judges are also a regular target of the sheriff. Addressing Milwaukee crime on the April 26, 2015 edition of ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a show produced by WISN-TV in Milwaukee, Clarke called judges ""the weak link"" in the criminal justice system, saying violent offenders don’t spend enough time behind bars.   As an example, he alluded to Ricky Ricardo Chiles III, a 27-year-old Milwaukee man who shot and killed the driver of a van that killed his 2-year-old nephew in a traffic accident. Chiles previously served time in prison for his role in a bank robbery. ""When a person comes up before a judge for an armed robbery, a bank robbery -- like the guy who shot the person who hit the 2-year-old -- he got a 13-year sentence, of which he served two years, and he's put right back on the street,"" Clarke said. ""We don’t have a law problem -- we don’t need more laws -- we need tougher sentencing."" Clarke's claim suggests Chiles was sentenced to 13 years in prison but served only two. That’s not what happened. Chiles’ case Late on the afternoon of April 12, 2015, a Sunday, Chiles’ 2-year-old nephew ran into a Milwaukee street and was killed by a passing van. Moments later, Chiles emerged. He shot the driver in the head and in a spray of bullets, fatally wounded his own 15-year-old nephew.  (Four days later, with police in pursuit, Chiles killed himself in a suburban Chicago hotel room.) The bank robbery occurred nearly four years earlier, on Aug. 4, 2011. Chiles, the getaway driver, was charged with being a party to the crime of robbery with threat of force. He pleaded guilty and, in January 2012, was sentenced. by Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Jeffrey Conen. Here is what Chiles could have faced and what he actually served for the bank robbery, in terms of time in prison and on extended supervision. The figures are based on state law and court records and were confirmed by the prosecutor who handled the bank robbery case.   Total term Portion in prison Portion on supervision Maximum possible sentence 15 years 10 years 5  years Chiles’ sentence 4 years 2  years 2 years   A few notes on the figures: Length of sentence: Chiles benefited from helping the district attorney’s office. The judge was told that Chiles cooperated in an unrelated homicide case that stemmed from an argument during a dice game, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The way a prosecutor put it, Chiles testified at the trial of ""a more dangerous offender"" and that man was convicted of first-degree reckless homicide. Time incarcerated: Chiles was credited for the time he spent in jail while his case was pending, which is common. So, of his two years behind bars, he served six months in jail and a year and a half in prison. Extended supervision: Chiles was released from prison in August 2013 and was due to remain on extended supervision until August 2015. That meant he still had about four months to serve at the time of his death. Clarke’s position As for Clarke’s claim, let’s note that when people talk about sentencing in a felony case, they usually think about the time an offender is being sent to prison. But technically, the sentence includes both time in prison plus time on extended supervision after the offender is released. Clarke’s spokeswoman, Fran McLaughlin, told us the sheriff meant to say Chiles could have gotten a 13-year sentence. But she acknowledged the total maximum sentence was actually 15 years -- 10 years in prison, plus five years of extended supervision. McLaughlin said Clarke’s point was that Chiles could have received a 15-year sentence but he served only two years in prison. But Clarke’s claim ignores the fact that Chiles would not have been given the maximum sentence, since he had been a cooperating witness in a homicide and a recommendation for a lesser sentence was part of the plea agreement. Our rating Clarke said the man who killed a motorist who fatally struck a 2-year-old was ""back on the street"" because he had received a 13-year sentence for bank robbery but only ""served two years."" Chiles’ sentence was four years, not 13. Chiles did spend two years behind bars, as Clarke indicated, but he was also sentenced to two years of extended supervision. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B176C0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/30/david-clarke-jr/killer-was-street-after-serving-2-years-13-year-ro/

Ben Carson says U.S. spending on health care is double next closest nation
","As a world-renowned neurosurgeon who’s considering running for president, Dr. Ben Carson is familiar with, and critical of, the country’s medical system. Appearing in Manchester at the beginning of the month, Carson told attendees at a health-care forum organized by the National Cultural Diversity Awareness Council that the Affordable Care Act was either poorly thought out, or designed to control ""every aspect"" of people’s lives. ""We have atrocious problems with access (and) horrible inefficiency problems,"" he said. Carson, a Republican, argued on behalf of health-savings accounts as a way to make people take responsibility for their own health care spending. Carson went on to say that the United States, at No. 1, doubles the health care spending of the No. 2 nation. ""We spent twice as much per capita for health care in this country as the next closest nation,"" he said during a 30-minute talk, which ranged from his own biography to entitlement and military spending. We thought that was worth looking into. Could the United States really be spending twice as much per person as nations with universal health care, such as those in Europe? According to the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) -- which monitors economic and social well-being factors in a wide-ranging group of 34 advanced industrialized countries around the world -- Americans spend more money on health care than any other nation, without much evidence that they’re getting the best value for their dollar.  On health care, the OECD has found that the United States spends far and away more per capita and as a percentage of gross domestic product than any other country. The average spending for OECD nations is less than $3,500 per capita, according to 2013 OECD data. By comparison, the United States, at $8,745, is about 2.5 times the average. But Carson was referring to the ""next closest nation,"" not the average nation. Working down from the United States, the ""next closest nation"" is Norway at $6,140 per capita. After that, it’s Switzerland at $6,080 per capita. Compared to those figures, the United States’ spending is about 1.4 times that of the ""next closest nation."" (By examining life expectancy, which is the most common at-a-glance health care metric, the U.S., with its 26th out of 36 ranking, lags significantly behind those other nations. Norway was ranked No. 10 and Switzerland was No. 1 .) Asked for a clarification, a spokesperson for Carson’s exploratory committee cited the OECD data and said that he misspoke. ""His statement should have been, ‘We spent twice as much per capita for health care in this country as the next closest nations.’ ‘Nations’ should be plural,"" the spokesperson wrote in an email. She said when averaging the health care cost of the other nations in the top 10, ""the US more than doubles the average of those countries."" She added: ""The U.S. spends $8,745 per capita while those other 9 countries spend, on average, $3,484,"" and linked to this chart as proof. The nine other countries she cited and shown on the chart were Switzerland, Canada, Germany, France, Sweden, Australia, UK, Japan and Italy. However, those are not numbers two through 10 in terms of per-capita spending. Switzerland, Germany and Canada are in the top 10, but the others range up to No. 19, Italy. The $3,484 number is the average for all 34 countries surveyed, including the United States. The real figure for average per capita spending in countries two through 10 is about $5,000. There are specific instances where Carson’s claim could be dead on. For instance, France, which is considered by the World Health Organization to be one of the best in the world in terms of quality, and spent less than half of what the United States did per capita in the most recent OECD data from 2013. But Carson wasn’t speaking only about France, which officially comes in at No. 11 on the list. It’s worth noting, the other top 10 countries – except for the U.S. –  all offer universal health care to their citizens. The U.S. has taken some steps in that direction, but Carson’s plan would go a different way. Our ruling Carson said: ""We spent twice as much per capita for health care in this country as the next closest nation."" Carson’s numbers are off. Spending in the United States is about 1.4 times the next-highest nation, and it’s about 1.7 times the average of the nations that rank second through ninth in spending -- the group Carson’s spokeswoman said he had been intending to reference in his comment. That said, Carson has a point that spending in the U.S. is higher, and approaches double its peers, especially when looking at the average spending for the other OECD nations. On balance, we rate Carson’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AE0240>],/factchecks/2015/apr/30/ben-carson/ben-carson-says-us-spending-health-care-double-nex/

Rose Mary Grant says R.I. charter schools ‘outperform’ those in other states
","The subject of charter schools — the state money they get and the regulations they operate under — has been at the center of legislative debate among state lawmakers and educators through much of the General Assembly’s 2015 session. On March 29, the head of school at Highlander Charter School in Providence wrote an opinion column in The Providence Journal that framed the debate around the academic growth of students enrolled in the state’s 25 charter schools. ""All of Rhode Island loses if we cut funding to the very schools that are nationally recognized as outperforming their counterparts across the country,"" Rose Mary Grant wrote. We can’t fact-check whether ""all Rhode Island loses."" That’s an opinion. We were, however, intrigued by Grant’s statement that Rhode Island’s charter schools ""are nationally recognized as outperforming their counterparts."" By ""outperforming,"" Grant did not claim that charter schools here are producing students who are more proficient than students elsewhere in the country. Rather, Grant wrote that charter schools in Rhode Island had more impact on their students than charter schools in other states. ""Rhode Island is moving students at a higher rate,"" Grant said in an interview. ""They are outperforming the pack at moving the students who need to move the most."" The basis for her claim is a 2013 study that developed a particular metric — tied to test scores and the performance of both charter school students and traditional public school students — for measuring the improvement of learning of each state’s charter school students. Based on this measure, the learning gains of Rhode Island charter students exceeded those of their peers in traditional Rhode Island schools, according to the National Charter School Study, a 95-page research report from the Center for Research on Education Outcomes at Stanford University. Students in traditional Rhode Island schools would need 86 days of additional instruction to show the degree of reading improvement seen in the charter schools students. In math, they would need an extra 108 days of instruction. Also, the total difference in learning gains was greater in Rhode Island than the 27 other states studied, according to the report. The Stanford researchers listed Rhode Island among nine states that ""deserve mention"" for charter school performance that ""outpaced"" traditional school performance in both reading and math. In contrast, the report shows that charter school students in 10 of the 27 states fell behind their peers in traditional schools. The study covered 2005  to 2011 and reviewed the records of 1.5 million charter students in 27 of 42 states with charter schools, representing 95 percent of the nation’s charter students. Here’s how the research was done: The center logged charter school students’ math and reading scores on tests taken prior to their enrollment in charter schools. This allowed the researchers to establish a starting point. The researchers identified a student in the traditional school system whose scores put him or her at the same starting point as the particular charter school student. They also matched traditional and charter students on demographic factors including gender, race and eligibility for free or reduced-price lunches. The researchers say they found a ""virtual twin"" for each of the charter school students. But one critic, Andrew Maul, a statistician and assistant professor at the University of California Santa Barbara, has a problem with the methodology. Maul suggests that families who select charter schools might be different from those who do not. Such a difference can affect a student’s performance, he says.   We reached out to the project director, Margaret E. Raymond, for a response. She argued that the matching process did sufficiently account for factors such as family background. A student’s past school performance, which governed the matching, is a function of family background, Raymond said. One point emphasized by the report’s authors, but not mentioned by Rose Mary Grant, is the importance of overall proficiency, not just improvements over peers. ""To measure how much they [charter schools] contribute to student academic growth is clearly essential,"" says the report. And although the researchers compared gains posted by charter schools, they did not present data that would allow one to compare the proficiency of Rhode Island charter school students with their counterparts in other states. In other words, the study details how much charter school students in Rhode Island are gaining. It does not describe how proficient they ended up being in math and reading. ""It is true,"" Raymond wrote in an email, ""that the effect in Rhode Island of attending charter school was shown to be larger than other states included in the study."" ""But, ultimately,"" according to the report, ""students need to be prepared for ‘what comes next,’ be it the next grade span or post secondary education or career advancement, so absolute achievement is also important."" Our ruling The study that Grant cited in her column did show that the learning gains of the state’s charter school students surpassed the learning gains of their Rhode Island peers and that these gains were greater than gains in the other states that participated in the study by Stanford’s Center for Research on Education Outcomes. But the writers of the study cautioned educators not to lose sight of the importance of proficiency. Grant did not reflect this concern in her column. Further, while she boasts that Rhode Island charter schools were ""nationally recognized,"" the study cites Rhode Island as one of nine states that ""deserve mention."" For these reasons, we rule the statement Mostly True.

Nation of Islam group says Israeli security trained Baltimore cops
","We’ve seen plenty of claims in recent days about the unrest in Baltimore. One that caught our attention was a tweet from an account associated with the Nation of Islam. It read, ""#Baltimore police trained by Israel Mossad & Shin Bet. More planned."" The Mossad is Israel’s foreign intelligence service and the Shin Bet is its internal counter-intelligence agency. They roughly correspond to the American CIA and FBI. So, are the Mossad and Shin Bet working with Baltimore police? No. Nation of Islam researchers included a link in their tweet that sent us to a page on the Baltimore County Police Department website. While county police were called in to assist during the riots, they are not the city police. The link includes no information or evidence that county police were trained by Mossad and Shin Bet. What that website says is that county police offered optional training for officers interested in a martial art called Krav Maga (pronounce ma-GAA). Krav Maga does have a strong connection with Israel. It was developed by the Israeli Defense Force in the earliest years of the country’s existence. It emphasizes quick and debilitating counter attacks in one-on-one combat. The instructor mentioned on the Baltimore County webpage was Jon Pascal, who had spent 15 years with the Los Angeles County Police Department. There is nothing to suggest that Pascal is a Mossad or Shin Bet agent. Krav Maga combines elements of wrestling, boxing and jiu-jitsu. The introductory sessions focus on stripping a knife or gun from an armed attacker, escaping chokeholds, restraining holds, and delivering blows that incapacitate an attacker. Elementary training in Krav Maga is not uncommon among American police departments. A local news report from Pittsburgh, Pa., featured officers from the Pittsburgh and Mt. Lebanon, Pa., police departments. An instructor with Krav Maga Maryland lists among his clients officers from Baltimore City, Montgomery, Howard and Prince George’s counties, as well as the Maryland State Police and the Capitol Police. According to that Maryland group, over 400 law enforcement agencies have used some level of Krav Maga training since 1981. We tried to reach Nation of Islam Research but no one answered at the phone number listed, nor did we get a reply to a message sent through the Nation of Islam website. Our ruling The Nation of Islam Research group said that police in Baltimore had been trained by Mossad and Shin Bet. The source they cited referred to optional training in Krav Maga for the wrong police department and listed a trainer who gained experience in Los Angeles. There’s no evidence of any training ties to Israel. This claim is utterly unproven.

Rush Limbaugh says Clinton Foundation spends just 15 percent on charity, 85 percent on overhead
","Much of the discussion about the Clinton family foundation has focused on who donated to it and what they may have expected in return from then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. But critics of the Clintons have opened up another line of attack on what is formally known as the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation, charging that it doesn’t actually spend very much on charitable works. Conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh aired this line of argument on April 23, 2015, citing a report in the Federalist, a conservative publication. Here’s a portion of what Limbaugh said: ""The Marine Corps-Law Enforcement Foundation -- 99 percent pass-through. The Clinton Family Foundation pass-through is 15 percent. The Federalist reports only 15 percent of the money donated to the Clinton Family Foundation went to actual charitable causes. The bulk of the money donated to the Clinton Family Foundation went to travel, salaries, and benefits. Sixty percent of all the money raised went to other expenses. In other words, folks, 85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary."" As this claim was circulating, the Clinton Foundation pushed back. The foundation tweeted, ""More than 88% of our expenditures go directly to our life-changing work."" The difference between 15 percent and 88 percent is wide, so we decided to check Limbaugh’s claim. A representative with Limbaugh’s radio network didn’t answer an email inquiry. An unusual approach for a foundation When most people in the charitable world think of foundations, they think of organizations that give away a lot of money in the form of grants to others who go out and do good works. The Clinton foundation works differently -- it keeps its money in house and hires staff to carry out its own humanitarian programs. This set-up means the Clinton foundation’s finances get complicated in ways other foundations do not. Partly because of that, one of the leading independent groups that track charities -- Charity Navigator -- has been flummoxed about how to analyze that foundation and has stopped rating it, at least for now. Charity Navigator says it has ""determined that this charity's atypical business model cannot be accurately captured in our current rating methodology. Our removal of The Clinton Foundation from our site is neither a condemnation nor an endorsement of this charity. We reserve the right to reinstate a rating for The Clinton Foundation as soon as we identify a rating methodology that appropriately captures its business model."" What is counted in the foundation’s financials? The Federalist article that Limbaugh cited dug into the Clinton foundation’s tax forms known as 990s, which nonprofits have to file annually with the Internal Revenue Service. Here’s an excerpt from the Federalist article: ""When anyone contributes to the Clinton Foundation, it actually goes toward fat salaries, administrative bloat, and lavish travel. Between 2009 and 2012, the Clinton Foundation raised over $500 million dollars according to a review of IRS documents by The Federalist (2012, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008). A measly 15 percent of that, or $75 million, went towards programmatic grants. More than $25 million went to fund travel expenses. Nearly $110 million went toward employee salaries and benefits. And a whopping $290 million during that period — nearly 60 percent of all money raised — was classified merely as ‘other expenses.’ "" The Clinton foundation, on the other hand, gets to its 88 percent going to ""life-changing work"" by combining the finances of the Clinton Foundation and an affiliated organization, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, that before 2010 had been part of the Clinton Foundation proper. The Clinton Health Access Initiative works with governments and private groups to lower the costs of treatment for HIV/AIDS in the developing world. The Clinton Health Access Initiative was split off from the foundation because ""they got so big they needed their own organization to do it,"" said Craig Minassian, a spokesman for the foundation, in an interview with PolitiFact. But in putting together its annual report for 2013, the Clinton Foundation folded together both groups before calculating the numbers. Some question the logic for doing it this way. ""Clinton allies are deliberately conflating the activities and finances of multiple independent nonprofit organizations and hoping you'll view everything together as ‘The Clinton Foundation,’ "" Sean Davis, who wrote the Federalist story, told PunditFactc. ""That's just not the case, though."" The correct number for the Clinton Foundation alone -- which owned the account the tweet was sent from -- was just over 80 percent in 2013, not 88 percent. The Clinton Foundation’s unusual model As we noted earlier, many foundations carry out charitable works by giving money to other organizations that, in turn, do the ground-level charity work, whereas the Clinton foundation’s charitable works are mostly done by people on the foundation’s payroll. ""We are an implementing organization rather than a grantmaking organization,"" said the foundation’s Minassian. That’s why the Clinton Foundation’s 990s show a relatively small amount of money categorized as ""grants"" -- only about 10 percent of all expenses in 2013. The foundation says its own employees are doing its charitable work. The annual report -- which, remember, includes both the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Health Access Initiative -- says that 7 percent of expenditures were spent on ""management and expenses"" and 4.5 percent for ""fundraising."" (The numbers on the 990s for the two entities are in the same ballpark.) Add those two percentages together and you get almost 12 percent; subtract that from 100 percent and you get the magic 88 percent figure the foundation cited. An independent academic CPA who specializes in nonprofit foundation finances said Limbaugh’s error was in assuming that all spending beyond grants amounted to wasteful overhead. ""When Mr. Limbaugh says most of the spending is on salaries, travel, and other, that is not particularly informative,"" said Linda Parsons, an associate professor of accounting at the University of Alabama's Culverhouse College of Commerce. ""Travel and salaries for those who are directly carrying out the mission of the organization are much different than salaries and travel for executives who are networking in order to raise funds or for those who manage the organization. The response from the Clinton foundation that they carry out their missions directly, rather than outsource it to another organization or series of organizations, makes sense given that the Clinton Foundation reports travel, salaries, depreciation and conferences directly."" Of course, Parsons’ interpretation depends on trusting the Clinton foundation’s characterization of its expenditures. As with any institution that files tax forms, the Clinton foundation has to characterize on its own what counts as ""management"" and what counts as spending on front-line charity work. The Federalist article says the foundation’s tweet exaggerates when it says money spent ""directly"" on ""life-changing work,"" when in fact the group, by its own calculations, ""spent nearly $8.5 million – 10 percent of all 2013 expenditures – on travel. Do plane tickets and hotel accommodations directly change lives? Nearly $4.8 million – 5.6 percent of all expenditures – was spent on office supplies. Are ink cartridges and staplers ‘life-changing’ commodities?"" In response to a PolitiFact request, the Clinton Foundation said the expenditures for its programs are ""inclusive of salaries for staff, large-scale conferences (which is how the foundation convenes partners to take action such as the Clinton Global Initiative and the Health Matters conference), training for farmers and other beneficiaries, as well as direct program expenses like purchasing seeds and fertilizer for our agricultural programs and medical equipment for our public health work."" Reasonable people can disagree about how to categorize expenses, said Janet S. Greenlee, emeritus professor of accounting at the University of Dayton business school. ""There is no approved, required, or suggested method for allocating costs between program and nonprogram spending, so two charities that have the same financial events may have totally different financials,"" Greenlee said. ""Limbaugh is saying everything that’s not direct service must be a waste of money, while the foundation is probably estimating that most of its other costs are actually direct service and so are accounted as such. The ‘truth,’ if there is such a thing, is somewhere in between."" The foundation sent PolitiFact a rough geographic breakdown for program spending in 2012 and 2013. It cited expenditures split between 66.2 percent for the United States, 18.1 percent for South America, 5.6 percent for Southeast Asia, 4.9 percent for Sub-Saharan Africa, 3.6 percent for Central America and the Caribbean, 1.2 percent for West and Central Africa and 0.4 percent for Mexico. That’s more than we had expected to see in domestic spending -- we’re checking with the foundation on why that was so high, and will report their explanation if we receive one -- but even if the foundation devoted as little as one-third of its expenses to programs outside the U.S., then Limbaugh’s 15 percent estimate would be too low. To offer some context, spending 88 percent of expenses on charitable programs, as the Clinton foundation says it does, would actually be pretty good by industry standards. Parsons said the average reported across all organizations in the National Center for Charitable Statistics is 81 percent -- equal to the Clinton Foundation’s rate on its own -- and the Better Business Bureau’s Wise Giving Alliance suggests a minimum of 65 percent. ""The foundation exceeds that,"" Parsons said. Our ruling Limbaugh said ""85 percent of every dollar donated to the Clinton Foundation ended up either with the Clintons or with their staff to pay for travel, salaries, and benefits. Fifteen cents of every dollar actually went to some charitable beneficiary."" There’s a grain of truth here -- roughly 85 percent of the foundation’s spending was for items other than charitable grants to other organizations, and a large chunk of this 85 percent did go to Clinton Foundation staff for travel, salaries and benefits. However, the foundation says it does most of its charitable work in-house, and it’s not credible to think that the foundation spent zero dollars beyond grants on any charitable work, which is what it would take for Limbaugh to be correct. The claim contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C29080>],/factchecks/2015/apr/29/rush-limbaugh/rush-limbaugh-says-clinton-foundation-spends-just-/
"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says he is more experienced and qualified than Barack Obama was during presidential run
","Marco Rubio focused quite a bit on his past to make his case for a future presidency during a recent visit to Iowa. During an interview with the Des Moines Register’s editorial board, the Republican touted his accomplishments to counter criticisms he is still a first-term senator, just as President Barack Obama was when he was elected president. ""I certainly feel I’m running for office with much more experience and qualifications than Barack Obama had when he ran. When Barack Obama ran for president, he was basically a state legislator from Illinois that had served in the Senate for two years,"" Rubio said April 25. ""I, on the other hand, have been a legislative leader from the third-largest state in the country who has served in the Senate four and a half years, and have invested a significant amount of time in national security issues, particularly intelligence."" So is Rubio right in saying his résumé is much more impressive than Obama’s was almost a decade ago? We’ll check both candidates’ curriculum vitae. Let’s start with an executive summary: Rubio, if he’s elected, will have spent about 17 years in politics and 19 years working overall. Obama had about 12 years in politics and 20 years of overall political and work experience. When you dig into the details, though, the differences between the two men seem fairly marginal. Rubio’s resume If Rubio is elected president in 2016, he will have the benefit of basically serving almost a full, six-year term in the U.S. Senate, more than the four that first-term Sen. Obama served from 2004 to 2008. During the Register interview, Rubio talked up his time on the foreign relations and intelligence committees, working to fashion himself as a foreign policy wonk. He also has served on the Committee on Small Business and Entrepreneurship and the Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation. Rubio had 11 years of political experience before that: almost two years as a part-time West Miami city commissioner from April 1998 to January 2000 and nearly nine years as a Florida state representative. He joined the Florida House after a special election in early 2000 and served through 2008 before leaving because of term limits. In the House, Rubio served as whip, majority leader and eventually speaker. Beyond that, Rubio graduated from South Miami Senior High School in 1989, attended three colleges and graduated from the University of Florida in 1993 before getting a law degree from the University of Miami in 1996. When not in politics, Rubio worked as a lawyer for private firms and shared teaching duties for a politics class at Florida International University in 2008 and 2009. Obama’s resume Obama’s history includes 12 years in politics before he entered the Oval Office. He was a senator from Illinois for almost four years from 2005 to 2008, although we’ll note that Obama announced his candidacy in 2006, so that’s really the point to which Rubio is comparing himself. We’re going to stick with the totals when he was elected, however. Obama also served on the foreign relations committee, as well as veterans affairs. He was on the environment and public works committee before that assignment was replaced with the Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions, and also homeland security and governmental affairs. Obama also served eight years in the Illinois state Senate from 1997 to 2004. Democrats only took majority control of the Illinois Senate in 2003, acting as the minority party during the rest of Obama’s years. (He also lost a primary run for the U.S House in 2000.) Obama was a 1983 graduate of Columbia University, then a financial analyst for a year, and a community organizer in Chicago for three years before attending Harvard Law School. He earned his law degree in 1991 and ran a voter registration drive called Illinois Project Vote in 1992. He worked for a private law firm in Chicago and began teaching in 1993, working as a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago law school while serving as a state senator. Our ruling We find Obama and Rubio’s overall experience to be roughly equivalent. Rubio would have an edge in political experience, although his time as a part-time city commissioner for a town of less than 6,000 people isn’t as rigorous as holding statewide office. Obama’s term as a senator came to a close sooner than Rubio’s would, due to the timing of the elections. But real-life experience outside the bubble of politics counts for something, too. Obama worked for years doing several different jobs, while Rubio spent some time as a lawyer. The time frame has something to do with it -- Obama was 47 when he became president, while Rubio would be 45 if he won election in November 2016. Rubio can claim he’ll have a few more years in political office, but Obama had a wider range of occupations. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D01940>],/factchecks/2015/apr/29/marco-rubio/rubio-says-he-more-experienced-and-qualified-obama/
"['Economy', 'History', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Democrats had total control of state politics for ""many years,"" Scott Walker says
","Republican Gov. Scott Walker had it two ways while defending his state’s economic record during a stop in Minnesota as he moves toward a 2016 presidential bid. Some media outlets interpreted his remarks as pushing back on the idea that Wisconsin’s economic recovery trails that of Minnesota, where Democrat Mark Dayton is governor. But Walker also spoke of Minnesota’s ""advantage"" in terms of economic growth and attributed it to politics. ""For many years, when (Republican Gov. Tim) Pawlenty was in office, the state was doing quite well,"" Walker said. ""You've had the advantage of having, other than a two-year period, Republicans in charge of at least one part of government for at least some time,"" Walker added, then noted. ""Before we came into office, for many years there was a Democratic governor, a Democratic Assembly and a Democratic Senate."" We can’t fact check Walker’s implication that Wisconsin fell behind because Democrats were running the whole show. That’s his opinion. But we can check his facts on who was in charge and when. Walker didn’t say how far back his comparison went, but his mention of Pawlenty suggests at least 2003, when Pawlenty was first elected. Here’s what we found when examining partisan control in both states: Minnesota Pawlenty served two terms, from 2003 through 2010, giving way to Dayton at the same time Walker assumed power in Madison in January 2011. So that means Republicans controlled at least one key lever for those eight years. From 2011 to present it’s been Dayton, a member of the state’s Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party, in the governor’s chair in St. Paul. Republicans held both legislative chambers in 2011-12, and one starting in 2015. But Democrats -- as Walker correctly noted -- ran both chambers from 2013-14 and of course had Dayton for those years as well. Wisconsin Walker confined his argument here to the years before he took office in 2011. But he misfires in saying Democrats had a total lock on power for ""many years."" Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle took office in Wisconsin in 2003 -- at the same time Pawlenty assumed control next door. Doyle also served eight years, then decided not to run for a third term. But Doyle only had a Legislature under total Democratic control for his last two years, 2009 and 2010. In fact, Republicans controlled the Assembly and Senate for Doyle’s first four years. Control then was split for two years before Democrats enjoyed their brief unfettered reign. Going back further, to 1995, Republicans in Wisconsin controlled at least one of the three power spots every year until 2009. The kind of single-party dominance that Walker claimed Democrats have enjoyed for many years is rare in recent Wisconsin history. Walker, though, is now in year five with Republicans gripping all three levers of authority at the Capitol. Our rating Walker said Minnesota’s ""advantage"" has been having ""Republicans in charge of at least one part of government"" for all but two years, while Wisconsin Democrats ""for many years"" controlled both legislative chambers and the governorship before 2011. In making the comparison, though, he overstates how long the Democrats had total control in Wisconsin. It was for a two-year period, before he took office and Republicans won complete control. The Republicans have had that status more than twice as long as the ""many years"" Walker said Democrats did. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFF0240>],/factchecks/2015/apr/29/scott-walker/democrats-had-total-control-state-politics-many-ye/

Pet-death claim leaves out important details
","A new tracking device available to pets being transported in the cargo hold was supposed to calm passengers about flying with Fido on Delta Air Lines. But coverage of gadget to monitor temperature and crate positioning also included some data that may have had the opposite effect. ""Delta has had the most animal deaths among U.S. carriers in the past five years, with 51, though it has had only 6 since 2013,"" according to a Bloomberg.com news report on March 31, 2015. Reaction on social media was less measured, at one point calling the Atlanta-based airline ""responsible"" for the most pet deaths on U.S. carriers. So PolitiFact Georgia decided to look at the statistics to see how Delta measures up when it comes to ferrying our furry friends. The U.S. Department of Transportation requires airlines to file ""animal incident"" reports regarding injuries or deaths to animals being flown in the cargo hold. The data is compiled into monthly reports that also include information such as arrival times and lost baggage. (As an aside, while the government requires reports on pet deaths, there is no similar requirement for any people who may perish during flights). PolitiFact Georgia reviewed annual tallies of the animal incidents for the past five years and found Bloomberg was correct on the numbers: Carrier 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 5-yr Total Alaska 4 4 1 8 3 20 American 6 5 6 1 3 21 American Eagle 1 0 0 0 0 1 Continental 6 3 0 0 0 9 Delta 16 19 10 2 4 51 Hawaiian 2 2 1 1 2 8 United 4 2 12 9 5 32 Total 39 35 30 21 17 142 But there is more to the data than just numbers. First, it’s important to recognize that some airlines accept pets only if they are small enough to fit in the cabin. Southwest Airlines, for instance, wouldn’t be on the list of cargo hold deaths because its policy does not allow for that kind of transport. And mergers in the industry will skew the numbers, too. Continental did not see zero animal deaths since 2011, for instance. It is just now part of United. It is also worth noting that when Delta saw the number of pet deaths increase in 2011, it carried far more pets than other airlines in part because of its broad route network. That year, the number of pets that were injured or died on Delta was less than 0.2 percent of those it carried, the airline said. Looking at it that way, it’s highly misleading to compare Delta with airlines such as Hawaiian. The smaller airline flies about a tenth of the miles that Delta does, yet in recent years has seen nearly as many animal deaths. Still, Delta was concerned about its increase and expanded its restrictions on certain pets. In particular, it stopped accepting snub-nosed pets such as bulldogs or Pekinese as checked items, since the animals have more difficulty breathing. As Bloomberg notes, the changes have helped dramatically reduce the number of animals that ran into trouble, with deaths down nearly 79 percent from 2011. Those numbers have fallen even as the sheer volume of animals it transports remains high. Delta flies tens of thousands of pets every year, out of the half a million that federal data show are in plane cargo holds.  About a thousand Delta flights take off out of Atlanta every day alone. ""We can’t say that every flight had pets on it. We can say that even one death is unacceptable,"" said Delta spokesman Morgan Durrant. ""Every pet is important to us. We wouldn’t accept the animal if we didn’t feel confident about their safety."" Incident reports back up Delta’s confidence. The majority of injuries and deaths are not from crew mishandling of the animals or in-flight problems. Rather, reports show the animals panicked in the kennels and attempted to chew or scratch their way out. Some animals died in their attempts. The American Veterinary Medicine Association recommends that pet owners acclimate their dogs and cats to crates well before flights, to help minimize that level of stress on the animals. The organization does not recommend tranquilizers, since that can depress breathing and increase stress. Likewise, it agrees with airlines on restrictions on some short-snout dog breeds, given they are already susceptible to breathing problems, said Dr. Kendall Houlihan, the assistant director of the AVMA’s animal welfare division. The limitations can vary for every pet, considering underlying health conditions, age and other factors, she said. ""The most important thing is for owners to speak to veterinarian as early as possible before the trip,"" Houlihan said. ""Part of that discussion needs to be whether air travel is appropriate."" Many pet owners have already decided that air travel is right for their dogs and cats, and nearly a half million fly every year without incident. Bloomberg news said that Delta has had the most animal deaths of U.S. carriers in the last decade. The numbers back up that claim, but they miss many of the reasons why. As one of the nation’s largest carriers, Delta cannot be accurately compared to significantly smaller airlines who may have higher pet deaths per miles flown, a statistic unavailable from airlines or government data. Without that missing context, the claim is just about numbers. And the numbers are accurate but misleading. We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CDBE00>],/factchecks/2015/apr/29/bloomberg-bloombergcom/pet-death-claim-leaves-out-important-details/

Did Obama pledge to stop using 'signature strikes'?
","The White House recently disclosed that the two hostages -- one American and one Italian -- were killed in January by an American ""signature strike"" aimed at al-Qaida terrorists. A signature strike is a type of drone strike, in which the United States targets people they believe to be militants, though they don’t know the exact identity of the target. Some have criticized the government’s use of such strikes because they run a higher risk of hitting innocent parties. Government officials told the Wall Street Journal that signature strikes have been effective for killing high-value targets, especially in regions where it’s hard to locate al-Qaida leaders. But the continued use of signature strikes goes against what President Barack Obama said he was going to do, said ABC News security consultant Richard Clarke, who spent 30 years working in government, including 10 years in the White House, before leaving in 2003. ""When you do these signature strikes, meaning by definition, you don't know who you are killing, you just know the facility looks like an al-Qaida facility,"" Clarke said on ABC This Week April 27. ""When you do signature strikes, that's very risky. And President Obama said he was going to stop them, and clearly he didn't."" Obama has relied heavily on drones -- nearly 2,500 people have been killed in covert drone strikes since Obama took office, according to the Bureau for Investigative Journalism, which tracks strikes. We wondered if Obama had gone back on what he said. Did he say he was going to stop signature strikes? Vague guidelines Clarke didn’t respond to several requests for comment. But we dug through Obama’s statements over the years, as well as campaign materials. We couldn’t find any instance in which Obama literally said he was going to stop using signature strikes. Clarke’s claim might stem from a May 2013 speech Obama delivered at the National Defense University, where he discussed vague drone policies. In the speech, Obama announced that he had signed a ""presidential policy guidance"" document where he codified a ""framework that governs our use of force against terrorists."" Although the event and document were widely seen as a shift to more restrictions on drone strikes, concrete details about the shift were almost nonexistent. The presidential policy guidance document itself is not publicly available, and the related fact sheet does not address drone strikes, much less signature strikes. A heckler in the audience asked specifically what Obama was planning to do about signature strikes, but he did not respond. An unnamed member of the Obama administration debriefed reporters on the shift, and one reporter asked, ""Will signature strikes explicitly be prohibited now?"" ""I don’t want to get into the details of any specific strike,"" the official responded, though he went on to say ""the type of strikes we’ve taken generally"" would eventually be phased out. ""Given the two principal changing circumstances in our effort against terrorism -- the winding down of the war in Afghanistan and the demise of al-Qaida core -- the need for the types of strikes that we’ve taken generally over the course of the last several years will be reduced over time,"" the official said. (Obama has since extended the withdrawal of American troops from Afghanistan.) Following the briefing, the New York Times reported that the codified standards ""could signal"" an end to signature strikes -- not that they would unequivocally. They also reported that officials said signature trikes would certainly continue in Pakistan, where the two men were killed. In fact, the Wall Street Journal recently reported that the CIA drone program in Pakistan is generally exempt from the 2013 policy guidelines, at least while the United States continues some level of operations in Afghanistan. At the time, Benjamin Wittes, a national security expert and editor of the Lawfare blog, wrote that it was unclear from Obama’s remarks and the coverage whether or not Obama actually narrowed the criteria for targeting people in drone strikes -- because the language was so opaque. Now -- two years later -- Wittes told PolitiFact, ""I don't think it's fair to say that Obama promised to end signature strikes."" Our ruling Clarke said, ""President Obama said he was going to stop (signature strikes)."" As far as we can tell, Obama has never said himself that he would stop signature drone strikes, which killed two western civilian hostages. An unnamed administration official implied that signature strikes would eventually be phased out, though without any details. In any case, the drone program in Pakistan, which killed the hostages, was generally exempt from these rules. Clarke’s claim suggests that Obama did something he said he wouldn’t do anymore, but that isn’t the case. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CDB800>],/factchecks/2015/apr/28/richard-clarke/did-obama-pledge-stop-using-signature-strikes/

Scarborough says Algeria donated to Clinton Foundation when it wanted off 'terror list'
","Television pundits are raising a lot of questions about foreign government donations to the Clinton Foundation during Hillary Clinton’s tenure as secretary of state. But not everyone get all the details right. Joe Scarborough of MSNBC’s Morning Joe flubbed describing the situation in the April 27 show. He was discussing a column by the Washington Post’s Ruth Marcus, whose op-ed highlighted an unreported donation to Bill Clinton’s foundation by Algeria in 2010 as an example of sloppiness. The donation, and others like it, raises questions about whether Clinton went ""soft"" on Algeria for contributing to her husband’s cause under the appearance of earthquake relief in Haiti, Marcus wrote. Scarborough said the situation will ""stink to high heaven"" even if it’s a legal gray area. ""I think it was Algeria, maybe, that had given a donation that went unreported at a time when they wanted to be taken off of the terror list in the State Department,"" Scarborough said. ""They write the check, they get taken off the terror list. ... At the same time, and then it goes unreported by the Clinton Foundation."" ""Is there a quid pro quo there? I don't know, that's really hard to tell,"" he said. Scarborough went on to break down to his panelists how easy it would be to explain to voters what might have occurred. ""This is pretty simple stuff. So Algeria is on the terror list, they want off the terror list, the State Department's making a decision to do it, they write a check for what? How much? How many million dollars do they write a check for? I don't know, but Algeria writes a check. You're from Boston, you know how politics works. They write a really big check to the Clinton Foundation,"" Scarborough said. ""The Clinton Foundation takes the check, and then just, out of nowhere the State Department then decides, well, they are going to take Algeria off the list. Now why did Algeria write a big check to the Clinton Foundation at the time they want something from the State Department? That's pretty simple for most voters."" The problem with all of this isn’t the donation, or questions about a quid pro quo with Algeria. It’s the fact that Algeria wasn’t ever on the terror list. (Media Matters first pointed out what Scarborough said.) An ally against terror The list Scarborough mentions is a serious designation given to just four countries the State Department considers state sponsors of terrorism: Syria, Iran, Sudan and Cuba. President Barack Obama is poised to remove Cuba from the list as a show of improved diplomatic relations. (Libya, Iraq and North Korea are the only countries that have been removed.) Algeria is actually a key partner of the United States in fighting terrorism in North Africa and ""has a long history of fighting terrorism,"" the State Department says. The country spent about 20 years locked in a civil war between the military and various Islamist groups after an Islamist group won a 1991 election that was scrapped. The country’s president, Abdelaziz Bouteflika, lifted a state of emergency in April 2011. But the country continues to struggle with radical violence in neighboring countries. Algeria was attacked by the group that calls itself al-Qaida in the Lands of the Islamic Maghreb almost 200 times in just 2013 in the form of improvised explosive devices, bombings, kidnappings, and fake roadblocks. Human rights violations hamper relations The Algerian government is not a state sponsor of terror. But its hands are not clean when it comes to human rights, which is most likely what Scarborough was trying to recall on air. The Washington Post story that revealed the Algerian embassy’s donation of $500,000 also mention that the one-time gift coincided with increased lobbying visits to the State Department about human rights violations. In 2010, Algeria spent more than $420,000 lobbying American officials on inter-country relations and on ""human rights issues,"" the Post found, citing documents filed as part of the Foreign Agents Registration Act. The year also saw an increase in meetings between State Department officials and lobbyists representing Algeria, growing from ""a handful"" of recorded visits in the years before and after to 12 visits in 2010, the Post reported. The Algeria donation came soon after the Jan. 12, 2010, earthquake in Haiti, the Clinton Foundation said. It was unsolicited and went to the Clinton Foundation Haiti Relief Fund, ""where the entire amount of Algeria’s contribution was distributed as aid in Haiti."" Algeria had not donated before and has not donated since, a foundation spokesman said. The foundation acknowledged it did not alert the State Department about the gift for vetting, which was required under a memorandum of understanding between the Obama administration and the Clintons in an effort to prevent foreign governments from trying to curry favor with Hillary Clinton’s State Department by donating to Bill Clinton’s philanthropy. So what are the human rights issues Algeria was lobbying on? Reports by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and the State Department outline the activities of a strict authoritarian government that represses its people’s freedom of assembly and association, overuses pretrial detentions, and employs a judicial system that is susceptible to corruption. The State Department’s 2010 report of human rights issues in Algeria highlights more issues including reports of arbitrary killings, the government failing to account for people who disappeared during the civil war in the 1990s, violence and discrimination against women, and continued restrictions for workers’ rights. The government of Algeria has resisted inspections by independent human rights groups. MSNBC's Diana Rocco said Scarborough deserves some credit for indicating he ""wasn’t sure it was"" Algeria, and that the exchange that followed ""clearly shows he’s using it as a hypothetical scenario to make his larger point about how the quid pro quo scenario may have unfolded."" None of that, though, means that Algeria was on the terror watch list in the first place.  Neither Algeria nor other governments revealed to have given to the foundation — Australia, the Dominican Republic, Kuwait, Norway, Oman and Qatar — are sponsors of terrorism, either. Our ruling Scarborough was trying to recall the details of a news story about Clinton Foundation donations from foreign governments when he brought up Algeria’s donation to the foundation to try getting off the ""terror list."" There are parts about the donations that may not look good for Clinton. Maybe it becomes a legal problem, maybe it’s just a political one. But to claim the foundation took donations from a country on the terrorist list is inaccurate. Scarborough’s claim rates False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097085B40>],/factchecks/2015/apr/28/joe-scarborough/scarborough-says-algeria-donated-clinton-foundatio/

Steve Adler says Austin's the 4th-most-congested U.S. city, worse than New York
","Traffic in Austin is so awful, Mayor Steve Adler declared, there’s less congestion in the Big Apple. Adler, speaking to the Greater Austin Chamber of Commerce, said April 1, 2015: ""We have gone from being the 24th most congested city just about 10 years ago to being the fourth most congested — more congested than NYC,"" Adler said, according to his prepared remarks emailed later to an Austin American-Statesman editor. Is all of that so? Austin’s congestion may have gotten even worse, we learned, though hizzoner’s New York angle overlooks that drivers bent on reaching the boroughs have longer commutes. To our inquiry, mayoral aide Jim Wick said Adler relied on traffic scorecards for different years put out by Inrix, a company that says it analyzes real-time traffic conditions as part of its focus on ""understanding the science of traffic."" In the latest Inrix scorecard, Wick noted by email, Austin landed fourth in traffic congestion, New York fifth. We confirmed those rankings as cited. But a March 2014 Inrix summary of its latest report, based on traffic conditions in 2013, suggests Austin motorists wasted fewer hours stuck in traffic on average that year (41 hours) than drivers in New York, who averaged 53 wasted hours. Cities with more hours wasted in traffic were Los Angeles (No. 1), Honolulu and San Francisco, Inrix said. Inrix’s illustration of the Austin-New York results:  SOURCE: Blog post, ""Three Takeaways from INRIX’s 7th Annual Traffic Scorecard,"" Inrix website, March 2014 (accessed April 8, 2015) Still, Austin ranked No. 1 nationally in traffic complaints made on Twitter, besting Los Angeles, Washington, D.C., and Seattle, according to the summary. And did Austin rank 24th in congestion a decade past? Wick emailed us a February 2009 Inrix scorecard, based on traffic conditions in 2008, placing Austin-Round Rock 21st nationally that year and 26th in 2007. (This is a good time to stress that each city analyzed by Inrix is the city’s metropolitan area, sweeping in nearby communities.) Wick said the mayor's prepared remarks may have had a typo; they should have said 24th. Inrix: Austin congestion ‘getting worse’ Next, we turned to Inrix to ask why Austin edged New York in the latest congestion rankings even though New York drivers piled up more hours stuck behind trucks. Inrix spokesman Jim Bak reaffirmed that New York drivers spent more time on average stuck in traffic in 2013, but Austin ranked worse in ""congestion intensity"" according to the Inrix index basically showing how bad traffic gets at peak drive times, Inrix says. For a road segment with no congestion, for instance, the index score is zero. Each additional point in the index represents a percentage point increase in the average travel time of a commute during peak travel hours compared to free-flow conditions. Peak times are defined as the weekday hours from 6 a.m to 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 6 p.m. For 2013, Inrix says, Austin had a higher index than New York. In fact, more up-to-date Inrix data indicates that in the 12 months through July 2014, Austin still ranked fourth nationally with an Inrix index score of 23.3; New York, by then placing sixth nationally, had a score of 20.7. What this means: Austin drivers accustomed to a 20-minute free-flow trip were taking nearly 25 minutes to make the same trip at peak times--reflecting a 23 percent increase of four minutes and forty seconds over free-flow conditions. The traffic delay exceeded the comparable pause for New York drivers by 32 seconds, per Inrix. By Inrix’s research, Bak indicated, Inrix’s report covering conditions in 2008 placed Austin’s index 21st nationally compared to 26th in 2007, he said. In 2008, cities that had worse traffic than Austin according to the Inrix index included Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth, Washington, D.C., Houston, Boston, Seattle, Minneapolis, Philadelphia, Atlanta, Phoenix, Miami, San Diego, Denver, Baltimore, San Jose and Detroit. Drumming the Truth-O-Meter, we asked Bak to unpack the New York contrast. Can it really be Austin has worse congestion? After all, you rarely see a New York movie without cars piled bumper to bumper. Bak conceded New York drivers, on average, face longer commutes. But focusing solely on drive times to judge congestion, Bak said, would lead to results driven by population. We looked for alternate congestion analyses. Census Bureau survey By email, Alan Pisarski, a Virginia transportation expert, responded to our inquiry by suggesting we consider the latest federal survey indicating how long it takes Americans to get to work. The U.S. Census Bureau’s 2013 American Community Survey asked respondents to say how many minutes it usually took to get from their home to work the previous week. Austin residents reported average travel times of 23.5 minutes, placing the city behind more than 300 others with 65,000 residents or more, according to a chart emailed to us by a bureau spokesman. Cities with longer reported travel times included Pittsburgh and New York, with 40-minute averages; Chicago, 34 minutes; Philadelphia and San Francisco, 32 minutes each; Baltimore, 31 minutes; Los Angeles and Boston, 30 minutes each; Detroit, 27 minutes; Houston, 26; Las Vegas, 25--and many more. Bureau spokesman Robert Bernstein also emailed a chart showing the survey results by metropolitan region. By that filter, drivers from the New York-Jersey City-White Plains, N.Y. area reported travel times of nearly 37 minutes, the second-longest nationally. Drivers from the Austin-Round Rock area had travel times of 26 minutes, ranking behind more than 90 areas. Texas A&M Transportation Institute We also reached out to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, which has long gauged traffic conditions. Its 2012 ""Urban Mobility Report"" includes a chart indicating that in 2011 (the latest year checked), New York ranked fourth nationally with 59 hours in average travel delays per auto commuter while Austin tied for 17th with Portland, Oregon and Las Vegas with 44 hours in average travel delays per auto commuter. Another entry in the chart, though, states drivers in peak periods in New York and Austin were experiencing nearly identical percentage increases in travel times, on average. By phone, the institute’s Tim Lomax pointed out its research compares metropolitan regions, not cities in themselves. So its New York data takes into account portions of New Jersey and Connecticut and its Austin figures sweep in parts of nearby Hays and Williamson counties. Unlike Inrix, Lomax said, the institute ""weights"" its results so congestion on heavily travelled roads factors more significantly into results. Heads up: The institute is teaming with Inrix to produce a report covering 2014 traffic conditions, Bak and Lomax each said. And, Bak said, Austin looks to rank fourth again nationally for congestion with an index score of 24.9, up 7 percent. Congestion, Bak said, ""is getting worse,"" largely due to the improving economy. Given the A&M institute’s 2011 statistics showed drivers in Austin and New York facing nearly identical percentage increases in drive time but the actual minutes added in travel time were higher in New York, we asked Lomax if the data show Austin is more congested than New York. ""I don’t think they do,"" Lomax said, adding: ""By one measure, they have about the same traffic congestion. By another measure, New York is worse than Austin."" Still, he added, ""by no measure does Austin have a great traffic situation."" A decade ago We also peeked at charts showing how the institute’s travel time indexes and peak delay times for Austin and New York changed annually from 2006 through 2011. Austin's index ranged from 1.30 to 1.33, often placing the city fourth nationally. New York’s index, ranging from 1.32 to 1.42, ranked No. 1 two years, No. 3 other years. Austin’s average delay per peak-auto-commuter (a mouthful meaning the yearly sum of all the per-trip delays for drivers traveling in peak periods) ranged from a high of 56 hours in 2006 to a low of 43 hours in 2010 with its national rank ranging from 8th to 18th. New York’s comparables were a low of 54 hours of delay in 2006 to a high of 66 hours in 2007, landing the city third to ninth over the years. TomTom Lomax pointed us to another outfit that analyzes urban congestion--TomTom, maker of navigational devices. A chart posted online by TomTom in 2015 shows ""congestion levels"" for cities which it says is the increase in overall travel times at peak hours compared to travel times in free-flow conditions. Sound familiar? In 2014, according to GPS measurements from TomTom's traffic database, New York ranked fourth among the nation’s cities with a congestion level of 31 percent; Austin ranked 13th with a congestion level of 25 percent (the same as the levels in Houston and Tampa). Then again, TomTom also presents congestion as similar in New York and Austin in that an Austin driver with a 30-minute drive (counting trips to and from work) piled up 21 minutes a day in traffic delays--just like a New York counterpart doing a 30-minute commute. Nick Cohn, a TomTom traffic expert, called us back from New York and showed us how to check travel time added in morning versus evening peak times for each city. According to TomTom, New York drivers in 2014 faced slightly longer percentage delays weekday mornings--on average, seeing a 48 percent longer trip than in free-flow conditions compared to a Austinites’ 42 percent longer trip. But Austin drivers got delayed incrementally more in evening rush hour--experiencing an average 61 percent bump in travel time compared to free-flow conditions versus New York’s 56 percent surge. But around the clock and through each week, Cohn said, New York has worse congestion than Austin because its roadways are crowded more often. Taken as a whole, Cohn said, New York has more wasted travel time. ""Your chances of hitting a traffic jam outside peak periods is higher in New York than in Austin,"" he said. Our ruling Adler said of Austin: ""We have gone from being the 24th most congested city just about 10 years ago to being the 4th most congested. More congested than NYC."" Inrix ranked Austin the nation’s No. 4 worst for congestion through 2013, just ahead of the No. 5 New York area. Also, Austin placed 26th for congestion in 2007, not quite a decade ago. But there's missing context here in that by various measures, New York’s congestion comes out worse than what Austin drivers have been experiencing. On balance, we rate this statement Half True.

Kaine says 40 percent of guns sales estimated to escape background checks
","U.S. Sen. Tim Kaine commemorated the eighth anniversary of the Virginia Tech shootings that left 32 dead with a call for stronger gun laws. ""It’s estimated that 40 percent of all the guns that are sold in the United States occur with no background records check,"" Kaine, D-Va., said during an April 16 floor speech.  We asked Kaine’s office for the source of the statistic. Sarah Peck, his press secretary, pointed to a 1997 study by the U.S. National Institute of Justice that looked at gun owners’ responses to a 1994 national survey that asked them how they acquired their weapons. The researchers concluded 60 percent of the guns were bought from federally licensed firearm dealers and therefore subject to background checks. Federal licensed sellers have to conduct background checks before sales, individual private sellers and gift givers do not. The co-authors of the study had released a more detailed report on their gun owners’ survey in 1996, estimating that between 30-40 percent of all guns transactions occurred through an ""off-the-books"" transfer in which a background check isn’t required. The 40 percent figure has been long offered by gun control advocates as evidence that the nation needs tighter background check laws. But there’s been much debate about the research, conducted by Philip Cook of Duke University and Jens Ludwig of the University of Chicago, including:  The 1994 survey was conducted eight months after the Brady Act went into effect, mandating background checks on individuals seeking to buy firearms from federally licensed dealers. Survey participants were asked about gun their acquisitions going back two years.Some of the participants made gun purchases prior to the Brady Act, when they were not required to undergo federal background checks. Only a small group of gun owners -- 251 people -- answered the survey question about the origin of their weapons. Some of the gun owners weren’t sure how they’d gotten their guns, answering ""probably"" or ""probably not"" on whether they got the gun from a licensed firearm dealer. The 40 percent figure included transactions when a firearm was not sold but, for example, inherited or given as a gift. When the Fact Checker at The Washington Post asked Ludwig in 2013 to boil down the 1994 data, the researcher said that between 14 to 22 percent of the guns were purchased without background checks. The survey is almost 21 years old and begs a question: What’s the modern-day percentage of guns sold without a background check? Cook pointed us to an editorial he and Ludwig wrote about the 40 percent statistic for the National Review in the aftermath of the December 2012 shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. ""We’ve been following the give-and-take with some interest because our research is the original source of that 40-percent statistic,"" they wrote. ""Our views may come as a surprise: First, we don’t know the current percentage -- nor does anyone else."" Ludwig and Cook said their national survey had not been replicated. Updated data doesn’t exist, in large part, because federal funding for gun studies dried up two decades ago. President Barack Obama in 2013 signed an executive order to get the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other agencies to reexamine gun violence. The research is in progress.  There’s debate among researchers about whether the two-decade old figure on gun purchases without background checks remains reliable. Some, like Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida, say it is.  ""That 40 percent without a background check is a pretty good estimate,"" said Corzine, who has researched crime prevention and the role of firearms in violence. ""I have no quarrel with it."" The Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank, is less certain. The think tank said in a 2013 report that the figure has ""clear limitations"" given its age, and the fact that it comes from a survey of a small group of gun owners. ""Proponents of universal background checks, including this report’s authors, would be well served by acknowledging the limitations of the statistic,"" the center wrote.  Our ruling Kaine says ""it’s estimated that 40 percent of all the guns that are sold in the United States occur with no background records check."" His source is a small-sample survey that’s almost 21 years old. It counted some firearms that were purchased before a law went into effect requiring federal background checks for many gun sales. The 1994 survey measured gun transactions, which included firearms that were sold and those that were given as gifts or inheritances. When the results were adjusted to guns sold -- the term Kaine uses -- only 14 to 22 percent of the firearms were sold without background checks.  The researchers say they ""don’t know"" if their findings are relevant today. There’s no updated national study.   Kaine did not acknowledge these points. So we rate his statement Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0E45C0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/28/tim-kaine/kaine-says-40-percent-guns-sales-estimated-escape-/

Distracted driving behind the jump in roadway fatalities
","As your Mom would tell you, you don’t have to be doing anything wrong on the road to be in danger. The heartbreaking deaths of five Georgia Southern nursing students in a pileup crash outside Savannah last week is evidence of that sad truth. But the Georgia Department of Transportation is trying also to draw attention to the number of traffic fatalities statewide and the driver behavior behind the deaths. ""GEORGIA ROADWAY FATALITIES THIS YEAR: 388,"" flashed a DOT over I-75 in Cobb County on Thursday. ""STAY ALERT. STAY ALIVE."" Put in context, that’s more than three deaths every day, by the 113th day of the year. The implication of the sign suggests that driver behavior is contributing to those fatalities. But considering PolitiFact Georgia just fact-checked road fatalities in January, showing highway deaths appeared to be declining, could that trend already be reversing? And does driver behavior have anything to do with the trend? Yes and yes, according to Terri Pope, spokeswoman for the Northeast DOT region, when asked about the signs and numbers behind them. So far in 2015, traffic deaths are up 25 percent from last year, Pope said. The state is averaging 100 deaths a month on its roadways, putting it on track for 1,200 fatalities by year’s end. If that happens, it will be a 4.6 percent increase from 2014 numbers – and the first year-to-year increase in nine years. Even worse, of the year’s roadway deaths so far, only 38 percent of drivers were wearing seat belts and 69 percent failed to maintain their lane – behaviors that experts say save lives behind the wheel, Pope said. And, 60 percent of the fatalities were single-car crashes where the vehicle hit a tree, culvert or bridge or drifted into another lane. ""Those statistics show that drivers, now more than ever, are driving distracted or are driving impaired,"" Pope wrote in an email. So the number of roadway deaths in Georgia is definitely on the rise. But has distracted driving – such as the use of a cell phone – also increased as a contributing factor in those crashes? The state DOT does not have 2015 data with that information, since local law enforcement agencies would determine causes as part of investigations that will lag behind the actual accidents. But the type of accidents – those single-car crashes into fixed objects or failing to maintain the lane – indicate the driver was distracted by something. The Governor’s Office of Highway Safety provided PolitiFact Georgia with statistics on distracted driving from 2009 to 2014. The data, with last year’s numbers still considered preliminary are: Type 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 Total crashes 3,454 3,922 4,079 6,829 8,179 8,5,81 Injury crashes 862 1,102 1,022 1,800 2,091 2,275 Total injured 1,174 1,596 1,420 2,617 3,082 3,298 Fatality crashes 11 13 10 9 11 18 Total fatalities 11 23 14 9 13 19 
Looking at those numbers, it’s clear the number of fatal crashes in which distracted driving was a factor jumped nearly 64 percent in five years. The increase in the number of deaths was even worse: up nearly 73 percent in the five years (though down 17 percent from a high-water year in 2010). The same factors that had been helping push down roadway deaths – safer cars, stepped up enforcement of drunken driving and roadway enhancements – are likely to have allowed for more injuries in crashes, said Harris Blackwood, director of the highway safety office. But still, the number of people injured in distracted driving crashes jumped 181 percent in the five years. ""Driver error is a major factor in a lot of these crashes that have happened and in these increased fatal crashes,"" Blackwood said. ""You’ve just got to get your focus on that road. The life you save is going to be yours."" With a busy summer season of driving ahead, that is the message transportation officials hope gets through the numbers. The state DOT has begun flashing messages on Georgia roadways, indicating driver behavior is causing an increase in traffic fatalities. The numbers bear out that increase. And the kind of crashes, and data from previous years, indicates driving while distracted with texting and phone use is likewise on the rise. We rate the DOT’s claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097712F40>],/factchecks/2015/apr/28/billboard-spaghetti-junction/distracted-driving-growing-factor-jump-roadway-fat/

Ted Cruz says about half of presidents were previously governors, half were senators
","Texan Rick Perry, the former governor who might bid again for president, has indicated he expects Americans in 2016 to prefer a governor for president over, say, a member of Congress. ""If you’re in the Senate or if you’re in the House, you can give a speech and then go home,"" Perry said in November 2014. ""Governors can’t. We have to govern."" Texan Ted Cruz, the first-term U.S. senator who declared his candidacy for president in March 2015, recently countered that senators have often been president, David Weigel of Bloomberg Politics reported. According to Weigel’s recap, Cruz was addressing young Republicans in New Hampshire April 18, 2015, when someone asked what executive chops he could bring. Cruz responded by lambasting the ""graybeards"" in Washington, D.C. for coming up with the ""senator versus governor"" framework for president in the first place. And the idea that a governor makes for a better president than a senator, Cruz said, hasn’t been reflected in voter choices. ""Here’s what history teaches us,"" Cruz said. ""About half of the presidents have been governors; half of them, senators. There have been good and bad presidents who were both."" Cruz closed out: ""I think the test we ought to apply is not what job title a person had. I think the test we ought to have is: Who has stood up and fought?"" Our test: Checking if Cruz was right about a 50-50 split between presidents who were governors and those who warmed up in the Senate. Counting presidents To sort the presidents, we leaned on the White House’s website presenting biographical sketches of the presidents and separately asked experts from the Institute for Presidential Studies at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia, and the Washington, D.C.-based Center for the Study of the Presidency & Congress to run the numbers. Barbara Perry, the institute’s director, emailed us its initial sorting of the presidents; the center’s Alice Farrell emailed us its analysis. Statistically, Barbara Perry followed up by phone, Cruz’s statement was wrong in that around a third of presidents were previously governors, a third were senators and about a third were neither. Counting presidents Our own sort is here, showing: --NOT A GOVERNOR OR A SENATOR (14 PRESIDENTS): Three of the first four presidents--the exception being former Virginia Gov. Thomas Jefferson--were neither former governors or senators; the nation was young. Another 11 presidents also had neither distinction including Abraham Lincoln, Dwight Eisenhower, Gerald Ford and George H.W. Bush; --A GOVERNOR ONLY (13 PRESIDENTS): These include Grover Cleveland of New York, the sole president to win non-consecutive terms, Theodore Roosevelt (New York), Woodrow Wilson (New Jersey), Franklin Delano Roosevelt (New York)--and four of the six latest presidents: Jimmy Carter (Georgia), Ronald Reagan (California), Bill Clinton (Arkansas) and George W. Bush (Texas). --A SENATOR ONLY (11 PRESIDENTS): The first senator to be president was James Monroe of Virginia, who led the country from 1817 to 1825. And the next three presidents, including John Quincy Adams (Massachusetts) and Andrew Jackson (Tennessee), had been senators. Modern-era senators who moved up include Harry Truman (Missouri), John F. Kennedy (Massachusetts), Lyndon B. Johnson (Texas), Richard Nixon (California) and Obama. To our inquiry, University of Virginia researcher Bryan Craig placed James Garfield in this group. Garfield, a longtime House member, was elected to the Senate by Ohio lawmakers early in 1880 before winning for president in the fall. We placed Garfield on our ""neither"" list because he never served in the Senate. (Worse, he was shot in July 1881, dying that September.) --A GOVERNOR AND A SENATOR (5 PRESIDENTS): These were Virginian James Monroe; William Henry Harrison, who was governor of the Indiana Territory and then, years later, won election to the Senate seat from Ohio; New Yorker Martin Van Buren, who resigned his governorship after two months to become U.S. secretary of state; Andrew Johnson of Tennessee and John Tyler of Virginia. Upshot: Of the 43 men who have been president, 16 were former senators, 18 were former governors, 14 were neither. That is, 37 percent were senators, 42 percent were governors--and 33 percent didn’t serve as a governor or a senator. To reach these totals, we double-counted the five presidents who were both, giving credit where credit was due. Cruz’s point We shared slightly different preliminary counts with Cruz aides. By email, his campaign spokesman, Rick Tyler, responded: ""What the senator was conveying to counter the false ‘executive experience’ narrative is there have been roughly an equal number of senators and governors who have served as president."" Governors ascendant of late Of late, though, more governors than senators have advanced to the presidency including two--Clinton and Bush--elected to the job while serving as governor. Perhaps significantly, Obama in 2008 was the first senator to capture the presidency directly from a Senate seat since Kennedy in 1960, nearly 50 years earlier. Nixon and Lyndon Johnson, both former senators, each won election to the highest office after serving as vice president. Barbara Perry suggested governors have dominated in recent decades due to national upheavals--going as far back as the Vietnam conflict and the Watergate scandal-- leading voters to distrust candidates with records rooted in Congress. ""The more candidates could separate themselves"" from Washington, she said, the better, giving governors an edge. Our ruling Cruz said about half of the presidents have been governors; half of them, senators. Governors have had a good run of late and, over all, comprise 42 percent of all presidents with 37 percent being former senators. Perhaps overlooked by Cruz; 14 presidents were neither.

UPDATE, 5:07 p.m., April 28, 2015: We amended the headline and closing line of this fact check to clarify we were checking precisely what Cruz said.

"['Campaign Finance', 'Florida', 'Alan Grayson']","
Alan Grayson says he is No. 1 in the House for small donations
","A day after a Florida man landed a gyrocopter on the lawn of the U.S. Capitol to demand campaign finance reform, U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson talked up his own efforts to focus on small donations and his potential U.S. Senate bid. Grayson, an Orlando Democrat, told a reporter for Democracy Now on April 16 that he will ""probably"" run in a primary against U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, for Marco Rubio’s Senate seat in 2016. As Democratic Party activists and leaders consider their best path to winning that seat, Grayson wants to remind them of his populist fundraising: ""I’m the only member of the House of Representatives who raised most of his campaign funds in the last election from small contributions of less than $200,"" he said. We decided to check if Grayson holds a record in the House for contributions of less than $200. (A spokesman for Grayson told PolitiFact Florida that he is likely a few weeks away from making his decision but reiterated that he has said he will ""probably run."") Counting small donations The Federal Election Commission considers donations of less than $200 as small donations, which don’t have to be individually reported. Instead, candidates report a total amount of money from small donors. In the House for the 2013-14 election cycle, those who received the largest share of their campaign revenue from small contributions were Democrats -- and Grayson was indeed No. 1, according to a November 2014 analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics. Grayson’s small donations totaled about $1.8 million and equaled 57 percent of his $3.1 million donations. The House member who raised the next highest amount in small donations was Florida’s Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Weston, and head of the Democratic National Committee. She raised $1.2 million in small donations, which equaled 47 percent of her contributions. (Wasserman Schultz recently ruled out running for Senate in 2016.) The third place House finisher was U.S. Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota who raised about $850,000 in small donations, or 41 percent of his pot. On the Senate side for the 2013-14 cycle, Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota topped the list with $11.7 million in small donations, equaling about 40 percent of his donations. (During his Democracy Now interview, Grayson mentioned U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont as a leader in the Senate in raising small donations. Sanders, an independent who caucuses with Democrats and was re-elected in 2012, raised almost $5 million in small donations, or about 61 percent.) Who racks up small donations and why? So why are some member of Congress small donor leaders? In the case of Franken, a former Saturday Night Live star, the Center for Responsive Politics noted that ""name recognition in combination with hailing from a state with a strong grassroots tradition doesn’t hurt."" Grayson’s persona as a Democratic firebrand likely contributes to his fundraising abilities. ""The most successful small-money fundraisers mix media exposure with partisan taunting and ideological appeals,"" Adam Bonica, a Stanford political science professor, wrote in 2011. Grayson is famous for his provocative taunts against Republicans, such as describing the GOP health care plan as ""if you do get sick, die quickly,"" or comparing Dick Cheney to a vampire. Michael J. Malbin, director of the Campaign Finance Institute and a political science professor at the University at Albany, said polarization alone won’t get candidates a lot of money in small donations. In many cases, candidates are tapping into political organizations with an existing network of small donors. Grayson, for example, has received money bundled through ActBlue, an online Democratic fundraising group that focuses on competitive races. Candidates ""got their boost from national organizations that created support for the candidates by recommending them to donors who trusted the bundling organization(s) and who probably would not otherwise have known who the candidates were,"" Malbin wrote.   Our ruling Grayson said, ""I’m the only member of the House of Representatives who raised most of his campaign funds in the last election from small contributions of less than $200."" Grayson’s small donations equaled 57 percent of his donations during the most recent cycle, putting him ahead of second-place finisher Wasserman Schultz at 47 percent, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.

"['Crime', 'Public Health', 'Guns', 'Wisconsin', 'Van Wanggaard']","
No statistical evidence that a waiting period for handgun purchases reduces violence, lawmaker says
","Amid a surge in murderous gun violence in Milwaukee, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate voted to repeal a state law that requires a two-day wait for handgun purchases. Just before the April 21, 2015, vote, the author of the bill, state Sen. Van Wanggaard, made this waiting-period claim: ""There’s no statistical evidence that it reduces violence whatsoever,"" the Racine Republican declared. With the repeal bill moving to the GOP-controlled Assembly, and likely headed for GOP Gov. Scott Walker, let’s see if Wanggaard is right. The law The District of Columbia and 10 states, including Wisconsin, Minnesota, Illinois and Iowa, have laws that require a waiting period for purchases of at least some types of guns, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. Wisconsin’s law, in place since 1976, applies only to handguns and only to purchases from firearms dealers. It prohibits a handgun buyer from taking possession of the weapon until 48 hours after a background check is started -- even if the check comes back clean within a matter of hours or minutes. The City of Milwaukee, the Wisconsin Coalition Against Domestic Violence and the Wisconsin Medical Society are among groups that oppose scrapping the law. Some say the cooling-off period can help prevent crimes of passion, such as domestic violence. Under the repeal bill from Wanggaard, who is a retired Racine police traffic investigator, a buyer could take possession of a handgun as soon as the seller completes the background check. Groups backing the repeal include the National Rifle Association, the Milwaukee Police Association union and the Wisconsin Wildlife Federation. Some say the wait following a successful background check is an ""unnecessary time tax on both the purchaser and the dealer,"" and that a person who needs a gun for protection can be put at risk. Walker has indicated he supports the repeal. Asked about such a measure in February 2015, he told the NRA: ""I think we want to be a leader in this area as well."" Studies Here are highlights from some key studies about the effects of waiting-period laws: A study done by one researcher from Georgetown University and one from Duke University that was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association in 2000 examined the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, a 1994 federal law that established a nationwide waiting period and background check for handgun sales. (The waiting period provision was later removed.) The study concluded that the law’s waiting period was associated with reductions in the firearm suicide rate for people age 55 and older, but not associated with reductions in homicide rates or overall suicide rates. Other research has found that people who buy handguns are at a higher risk of committing suicide during the first week after the purchase. For example, an article published in 2000 by members of the Firearm Injury Center at the Medical College of Wisconsin said a Wisconsin study found a ""sharp increase"" in the risk of suicide within one week of a gun purchase. But a 2003 report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that reviewed studies on the effects of waiting periods on violence found that some studies indicated a decrease in violent outcomes associated with the delay, while others indicated an increase. And a 2012 study by one researcher from the University of Cincinnati and another from Arizona State University found no statistical effects from waiting periods on gun crimes. In a nutshell, except for suicide, the studies show Wanggaard’s claim about waiting periods and violence is largely correct. Experts Daniel Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins University Center for Gun Policy and Research, told us there is research linking more thorough background checks -- which take longer than an instant FBI check -- with reduced homicide rates. The more thorough checks are more likely to turn up reasons why a person cannot legally purchase a gun. But Webster said he is not aware of research that shows waiting periods reduce violence. Similarly, Harvard’s David Hemenway said he was aware only of research that links lower suicide rates with wait periods. Many studies link lower levels of lethal violence with strong gun control laws in general, but not with particular laws such as a waiting period, he said. Our rating Wanggaard said, ""There’s no statistical evidence that"" a waiting period for handgun purchases ""reduces violence whatsoever."" There is research to indicate that handgun waiting periods are linked with lower suicide rates. But we did not find evidence that waiting periods coincide with less violence being committed by one person against another. If such evidence emerges, we may revisit this item. As it stands, Wanggaard’s statement is accurate but needs clarification -- our definition of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F35AC0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/27/van-wanggaard/no-evidence-waiting-period-handgun-purchases-reduc/
"['Georgia', 'State Budget', 'Transportation', 'Taxes', 'Debbie Dooley']","
Maybe not today, and maybe under a different name, but tax claim mostly on target
","Ever since Georgia voters roundly rejected regional sales taxes to fund road and transit projects in 2012, state leaders have pledged to take the lead on transportation. The Legislature made good on that promise this year with House Bill 170. Awaiting the governor’s signature, the measure is projected to raise nearly $670 million in transportation funding next year, by moving the state from a series of sales and excise taxes on gasoline to a single excise tax. That plus a mix of new fees for drivers of electric car and heavy trucks, the end of a popular tax credit for electric cars and a $5 per-night fee on hotel/motel stays, is expected to generate close to $1 billion a year to tackle the state’s backlog of transportation projects. ""That is really what all of this has been about --- finding sensible and fair ways to make our transportation network better and keep Georgia moving forward,"" House Transportation Committee chair Jay Roberts, R-Ocilla, wrote in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. Not that everyone was on board. Sen. Mike Crane, R-Newnan called the bill a ""midnight run"" on taxpayers. Debbie Dooley, who led part of the opposition to the 2012 sales tax referendum as chairman of the Atlanta Tea Party, echoed that language on her Twitter page. ""GA Republicans just pulled a midnight run on taxpayers and passed a billion-dollar tax increase with a rushed vote giving only 2 hours,"" Dooley posted on March 31. Is that right? Does the long-awaited transportation plan translate into a massive tax hike? And with that, PolitiFact Georgia waded into the squishy semantics of what counts as a ""tax"" and what is a ""fee."" In public policy terms, a broad swath of people pay taxes, for broad services, even if they don’t use them. Homeowners pay property taxes to local governments, for instance, to fund police and fire departments they may never need. Fees, meanwhile, are charged for the use of a facility, service or good that government provides. Your federal taxes help fund national parks but you still pay a fee to camp under the stars. That much is clear. Where the lines blur is when politicos and journalists begin using the terms interchangeably. House Bill 170, for instance, refers to the state’s gas tax. The money paid by Leaf drivers, or hotel visitors? Those are called fees. But to public policy folks, the gas tax is more like a fee, said Barbara Neuby, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University who specializes in budget and finance issues. That’s because you can opt out of owning a car, never buy a gallon of gas and still benefit from others picking up the tab, making what they pay a fee. And to complicate things further? You can pay a tax and a fee at the same time. Don’t own a car but need some gas for your lawn mower? You aren’t using the road to drive but you still pay for the product. ""A lot of it is semantics,"" Neuby said. ""It’s a tax increase, or additional fees if you use certain things. To some people, that’s splitting hairs. Any time government extracts money from your pocket, folks tend to see it as a tax, even if it isn’t."" There is not, in economic circles, a clear or bright line between the two terms. After all, the gas tax could be a user fee if only motorists paid it. But to an economist, if a 10-year-old walks to Dairy Queen for an ice cream cone, the price will include the cost of getting the treat’s ingredients to the store, said William J. Smith, the economics department chairman at the University of West Georgia. ""Any good or service you purchase that involves transportation will involve the gas tax,"" Smith said. ""So that’s why it’s so hard to say with any conviction that any one thing is either a tax or a fee."" All told, both expert realms lend some credibility to Dooley, and the public, seeing the transportation bill as a giant tax hike. But that refers to the language distinction. Math math, however, does not fully back up claims about a tax increase. Jared Walczak, an analyst with the right-leaning Tax Foundation, examined Georgia’s gas tax at PolitiFact Georgia’s request. The current mixed system includes a 7.5 cent per gallon excise tax, a 4 percent sales tax and, generally a 3-4 percent local tax. The effective rate: 26.5 cents per gallon, based on the current AAA fuel price of $2.37 a gallon. And with the elimination of the local and state sales taxes and jump in excise tax? At today’s prices, motorists would pay 26 cents a gallon in taxes. The break-even point would be gas prices at $2.65 a gallon, Walczak said. And those calculations do not include the local option, which could add an additional 1 percent sales tax after a public vote. But because the bill also will index the excise tax to inflation, the amount paid is projected to go up over time, as the cost of living gradually rises. The state’s amended fiscal note acknowledges that index in its projections. The impact of the gas tax in 2016 will be up to $668 million. By 2020, the tax could generate as much as $867 million. ""Some people will pay more under this proposal. Those who drive a heavy truck, those who drive an alternative vehicle, will certainly pay more immediately,"" Walczak said. ""Certain others may pay less or identical amounts at this juncture, but in succeeding years that burden will be indexed to inflation and is apt to increase."" Dooley said that conclusion remains the same, regardless of the semantic dispute. The Tea Party understood the need for transportation funding, she said. Members supported the bill repealing a jet fuel tax exemption for Delta, estimated to bring in $21 million this year and up to about $32 million in 2020. By not looking at other tax incentives to cut – such as credits given to the movie industry or breaks that helped lure Mercedes Benz USA’s headquarters – lawmakers ensured most Georgians will pay more for the necessary work, she said. ""They are increasing the burden on everyday motorists in Georgia while giving out all of these subsidies to businesses,"" Dooley said. """"They can call it a fee all they like, but if it raises revenue like this does, it’s a tax,"" Experts quibble over the semantic distinction. And at least in the short term, people will pay slightly less, or about the same, on the tax that is the biggest piece of the funding overhaul. But over time, the experts agree that the burden on taxpayers will increase. The distinction between a tax and a fee brings it down a notch, but we rate Dooley’s statement about a ""billion dollar tax increase"" to be Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971206C0>],/factchecks/2015/apr/27/debbie-dooley/maybe-not-today-and-maybe-under-different-name-tax/
"['Foreign Policy', 'PunditFact', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Newt Gingrich: Clinton foreign donations 'clearly' violate Constitution
","Hillary Clinton is in the political crosshairs as the author of a new book alleges improper financial ties between her public and personal life. At issue in conservative author Peter Schweizer’s forthcoming book Clinton Cash are donations from foreign governments to the Clinton Foundation during the four years she served as secretary of state. George Stephanopoulos used an interview with Schweizer on ABC This Week to point out what other nonpartisan journalists have found: There is no ""smoking gun"" showing that donations to the foundation influenced her foreign policy decisions. Still, former Republican House Speaker Newt Gingrich says the donations are ""clearly illegal"" under federal law. In his view, a donation by a foreign government to the Clinton Foundation while Clinton was secretary of state is the same as money sent directly to her, he said, even though she did not join the foundation’s board until she left her post. ""The Constitution of the United States says you cannot take money from foreign governments without explicit permission of the Congress. They wrote that in there because they knew the danger of corrupting our system by foreign money is enormous,"" Gingrich said. ""You had a sitting secretary of state whose husband radically increased his speech fees, you have a whole series of dots on the wall now where people gave millions of dollars — oh, by the way, they happen to get taken care of by the State Department."" He continued, ""My point is they took money from foreign governments while she was secretary of State. That is clearly illegal."" PunditFact wanted to know if a criminal case against Clinton is that open and shut. Is what happened ""clearly illegal""? A spokesman for the Clinton Foundation certainly disagreed, calling Gingrich’s accusation ""a baseless leap"" because Clinton was not part of her husband’s foundation while serving as a senator or secretary of state. We did not hear from Gingrich by our deadline. Foundation basics Former President Clinton started the William J. Clinton Foundation in 2001, the year after Hillary Clinton won her first term as a New York senator. The foundation works with non-governmental organizations, the private sector and governments around the world on health, anti-poverty, HIV/AIDS and climate change initiatives. Spokesman Craig Minassian said it’s reasonable for the foundation to accept money from foreign governments because of the global scope of its programs, and the donations are usually in the form of tailored grants for specific missions. Hillary Clinton was not part of her husband’s foundation while she was a senator or secretary of state. Her appointment to the latter post required Senate confirmation and came with an agreement between the White House and Clinton Foundation that the foundation would be more transparent about its donors. According to the 2008 memorandum of understanding, the foundation would release information behind new donations and could continue to collect donations from countries with which it had existing relationships or running grant programs. If countries with existing contributions significantly stepped up their contributions, or if a new foreign government wanted to donate, the State Department would have to approve. Clinton took an active role in fundraising when she left the State Department and the foundation became the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation in 2013. But she left the board when she announced her run for the presidency in April 2015. The Emoluments Clause So how does Gingrich come up with the claim that Clinton Foundation donations are ""clearly illegal"" and unconstitutional? The answer is something known as the Emoluments Clause. A few conservative websites have made similar arguments in recent days, including the Federalist blog. The Emoluments Clause, found in Article 1, Section 9 of the Constitution, reads in part: ""No Title of Nobility shall be granted by the United States: And no Person holding any Office of Profit or Trust under them, shall, without the Consent of the Congress, accept of any present, Emolument, Office, or Title, of any kind whatever, from any King, Prince, or foreign State."" The framers came up with this clause to prevent the government and leaders from granting or receiving titles of nobility and to keep leaders free of external influence. (An emolument, per Merriam-Webster Dictionary, is ""the returns arising from office or employment usually in the form of compensation or perquisites."") Lest you think the law is no longer relevant, the Pentagon ethics office in 2013 warned employees the ""little known provision"" applies to all federal employees and military retirees. There’s no mention of spouses in the memo. J. Peter Pham, director of the Atlantic Council’s Africa Center, said interpretation of the clause has evolved since its adoption at the Constitutional Convention, when the primary concern was about overseas diplomats not seeking gifts from foreign powers they were dealing with. The Defense Department memo, in his view, goes beyond what the framers envisioned for the part of the memo dealing with gifts. ""I think that, aside from the unambiguous parts, the burden would be on those invoking the clause to show actual causality that would be in violation of the clause,"" Pham said. Expert discussion We asked seven different constitutional law experts on whether the Clinton Foundation foreign donations were ""clearly illegal"" and a violation of the Emoluments Clause. We did not reach a consensus with their responses, though a majority thought the layers of separation between the foundation and Hillary Clinton work against Gingrich. The American system often distinguishes between public officers and private foundations, ""even if real life tends to blur some of those distinctions,"" said American University law professor Steve Vladeck. Vladeck added that the Emoluments Clause has never been enforced. ""I very much doubt that the first case in its history would be because a foreign government made charitable donations to a private foundation controlled by a government employee’s relative,"" he said. ""Gingrich may think that giving money to the Clinton Foundation and giving money to then-Secretary Clinton are the same thing. Unfortunately for him, for purposes of federal regulations, statutes, and the Constitution, they’re formally — and, thus, legally — distinct."" Robert Delahunty, a University of St. Thomas constitutional law professor who worked in the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel from 1989 to 2003, also called Gingrich’s link between Clinton and the foreign governments’ gifts to the Clinton Foundation as ""implausible, and in any case I don’t think we have the facts to support it."" ""The truth is that we establish corporate bodies like the Clinton Foundation because the law endows these entities with a separate and distinct legal personhood,"" Delahunty said. John Harrison, University of Virginia law professor and former deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel from 1990 to 1993, pointed to the Foreign Gifts Act, 5 U.S.C. 7432, which sets rules for how the Emoluments Clause should work in practice. The statute spells out the minimal value for acceptable gifts, and says it applies to spouses of the individuals covered, but ""it doesn’t say anything about receipt of foreign gifts by other entities such as the Clinton Foundation."" ""I don’t know whether there’s any other provision of federal law that would treat a foreign gift to the foundation as having made to either of the Clintons personally,"" Harrison said, who added that agencies have their own supplemental rules for this section, and he did not know if the State Department addressed this. Other experts on the libertarian side of the scale thought Gingrich was more right in his assertion. Clinton violates the clause because of its intentionally broad phrasing about gifts of ""any kind whatever,"" which would cover indirect gifts via the foundation, said Dave Kopel, a constitutional law professor at Denver University and research director at the libertarian Independence Institute. Kopel also brought up bribery statutes, which would require that a gift had some influence in Clinton’s decision while secretary of state. Delahunty thought Kopel’s reasoning would have ""strange consequences,"" such as whether a state-owned airline flying Bill Clinton to a conference of former heads of state counted as a gift to Hillary Clinton. Our ruling Gingrich said the Clinton Foundation ""took money from from foreign governments while (Hillary Clinton) was secretary of state. It is clearly illegal. … The Constitution says you can’t take this stuff."" A clause in the Constitution does prohibit U.S. officials such as former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton from receiving gifts, or emoluments, from foreign governments. But the gifts in this case were donations from foreign governments that went to the Clinton Foundation, not Hillary Clinton. She was not part of the foundation her husband founded while she was secretary of state. Does that violate the Constitution? Some libertarian-minded constitutional law experts say it very well could. Others are skeptical. What’s clear is there is room for ambiguity, and the donations are anything but ""clearly illegal."" The reality is this a hazy part of U.S. constitutional law.  Gingrich’s statement rate Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/947e9cfc-05c6-4bc4-a4f8-00ee07b8ee52",[<zip object at 0x000002809773D440>],/factchecks/2015/apr/26/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-clinton-foreign-donations-clearly-vi/

Fact-checking 'Clinton Cash' author on claim about Bill Clinton's speaking fees
","Did foreign interests curry favor with Secretary of State Hillary Clinton by paying huge speaking fees to her husband? That’s the question raised in the forthcoming book Clinton Cash by author and political consultant Peter Schweizer. On the Sunday shows, Schweizer said that while his research uncovered no proof of a quid pro quo between foreign interests and the 2016 Democratic frontrunner, the evidence does suggest a troubling trend. In an April 26 interview on Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace highlighted a claim from Schweizer’s book. ""You have an interesting point that I want to put up on the screen that seems to demonstrate exactly the point you're making,"" Wallace said. ""Between 2001 and 2012, Bill Clinton made 13 speeches, 13, for which he was paid $500,000 or more. Eleven of those 13 speeches were at least eight years after he left the presidency while his wife was secretary of state."" Schweizer responded, noting that Bill Clinton’s speaking fees ""dramatically"" went up when Hillary Clinton, now a presidential candidate, took office in 2009. ""When you have one or two examples, it's a coincidence,"" he said. ""When you have this many, to me it's a trend."" We aren’t going to dig into the truthfulness of Schweizer’s overall thesis here. But we are interested in Bill Clinton’s speaking fees while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department. His book says,""Of the 13 Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state,"" according to the New York Times, which has an advance copy. By the millions In 2014, before Clinton Cash was in the public eye, the Washington Post analyzed Clinton’s speaking fees and found he made at least $104 million in speaking fees between 2001 through 2012 -- more than half of that income came from speeches in foreign countries (though he gave more speeches within the United States). To find out more about Clinton’s speaking fees, we turned to Hillary Clinton’s federal financial disclosure forms, made available by the Center for Responsive Politics, a research group that tracks money in politics. Because Hillary Clinton held federal positions from the time they left the White House in 2001 through 2012, her financial information as well as Bill Clinton’s is available for all those years. Schweizer didn’t respond to our requests for comment, but income information on the financial disclosure forms supports his claim. Here’s a list of all the speeches for which Clinton received a fee of $500,000 or higher, including the year, location, host and actual fee: 2003 -- Japan, $500,000 Sakura Asset Management (Japanese finance corporation) (A note: This speech was canceled, but the fee went to Clinton’s presidential library foundation); 2008 -- California, $500,000, Power Within (life coach Anthony Robbins’ brand); 2010 -- Russia, $500,000, Renaissance Capital (Russian finance corporation); 2010 -- United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Novo Nordisk (Danish pharmaceutical company); 2011 -- Nigeria, $700,000, THISDAY (newspaper); 2011 -- Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation (Austrian nongovernmental organization); 2011 -- Netherlands, $600,000, Achmea (Dutch finance corporation); 2011 -- China, $550,000, Huatuo CEO Forum (business conference); 2011 -- United Arab Emirates, $500,000, Abu Dhabi Global Environmental Data Initiative (international environmental information organization); 2011 -- Hong Kong, $750,000, Ericsson (Swedish multinational communications technology company); 2012 -- Nigeria, $700,000, THISDAY (newspaper); 2012 -- Austria, $500,000, Center for Global Dialogue and Cooperation (Austrian nongovernmental organization); 2012 -- Italy, $500,000, Technogym (fitness equipment manufacturer). So in the time Clinton left the White House in January 2001 and when his wife stepped down from secretary of state in February 2013, Clinton indeed gave 13 speeches for which he made more than $500,000. Eleven of those occurred since January 2009, when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state. Only two happened before then. Schweizer suggests that Clinton’s speaking fees went up in 2009 in part because companies wanted leverage within Hillary Clinton’s State Department. For example, New York Times reporters -- building off of Schweizer’s work -- found that while the State Department was involved in securing a uranium mining deal with Russia, investors in the company involved in the deal, Uranium One, gave millions to the Clinton Foundation. Additionally, ""shortly after the Russians announced their intention to acquire a majority stake in Uranium One, Mr. Clinton received $500,000 for a Moscow speech from a Russian investment bank with links to the Kremlin that was promoting Uranium One stock."" The article’s talking about speech No. 3 on the list above, the 2010 speech paid for by Renaissance Capital. ABC News also examined Clinton’s speaking records and found many instances in which he took in money from groups with pending interests at the State Department. State Department ethics officials had to sign off on these speaking engagements, but rarely did they say Clinton could not accept payment for a particular speech. Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign has staunchly denied the implication that there was some sort of quid pro quo for entities that contributed to the Clintons’ wealth, arguing that Schweizer’s book does not have firm evidence of any such deal making. Our ruling Schweizer said, ""Of the 13 (Bill) Clinton speeches that fetched $500,000 or more, only two occurred during the years his wife was not secretary of state."" We're not checking Schweizer's suggestion that the increased speaking fees were part of a plan to curry favor in his wife's State Department. But on the specific numbers, Schweitzer is correct. Hillary Clinton’s financial disclosure forms from 2001 through the end of 2012 confirm Schweizer’s claim. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097481B00>],/factchecks/2015/apr/26/peter-schweizer/fact-checking-clinton-cash-author-claim-about-bill/
"['New Hampshire', 'Foreign Policy', 'Rand Paul']","
Did State Department really send three comedians to India on 'Make Chai, Not War' tour?
","When Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul took to the stage in New Hampshire to woo voters at a Republican presidential summit, he took aim at Democrat Hillary Clinton. The pair have both formally declared their intentions to run for the country’s highest office. Paul went after Clinton’s time as Secretary of State between 2009 and 2013, criticizing several purchases and investments the department made during her tenure. ""Hillary Clinton’s State Department sent three comedians to India on the ‘Make Chai, Not War,’ "" he quipped, garnering laughter from the audience. It’s not the first time he’s dropped that line, and it grabbed our attention. The U.S. State Department pointed to a press conference in December 2011, when a spokeswoman answered questions about the comedy tour. The press conference drew some laughter from reporters, as noted in the transcript. The department sent three Indian-American comedians, who were part of a show called ""Make Chai, not War"" on the seven-city tour through India as part of a ""regular global cultural exchange program,"" former state department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland told reporters during the 2011 daily press briefing. While the title of the show was intentionally a joke, the purpose of the tour was more serious.  The trip was intended to stem religious prejudice and encourage tolerance. The trio of comics traveled India from Jan. 4 to Jan. 17, 2012. In addition to comedy shows, Nuland said, they held audience discussions focused on issues of religious tolerance, ran workshops and did interviews with the press. The full tour cost about $100,000, and the U.S. Embassy in New Delhi sponsored it with a $88,000 grant, Nuland said. ""The reason we decided to support this tour is because among the things that they are known for is their talk about religious tolerance, about the importance of breaking down prejudices, and about the positive experiences they had growing up as Indian Americans in the United States,"" Nuland said at the press conference according to the transcript. But the state department can’t claim credit for the tour’s catchy title. One of the three comics, Rajiv Satyal, launched the Make Chai, Not War show in 2007 to create a platform for other Indian-American comedians, according to a National Public Radio story published before the group embarked to India. The show’s Indian tour came about after U.S. Embassy cultural attache Michael Macy saw one of the comics, Azhar Usman, perform in London, according to NPR. When Macy switched to a post in New Delhi, he brought the comic to India for a solo tour, which paved the way to the ""Make Chai, Not War"" India tour, according to NPR. Stand-up comedy is an American art form, that is ""all about celebration of free speech,"" Usman said Thursday. ""Comedy has a very unique ability to allow people to have very difficult conversations that society may otherwise ignore,"" he said. ""To me it was a huge win."" Dating back to the 1940s, Secretaries of State have signed off on cultural exchange programs around the world. The current state department budget contains about about $100 million for Citizen Exchange Program, which includes cultural exchanges like the one to India. It’s not the first time Paul has invoked the ""Make Chai Not War"" tour to make a point. He brought it up while grilling Clinton at a 2013 U.S. Senate hearing about attacks on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya. ""I can understand that maybe you’re not aware that your department spent $100,000 on three comedians who went to India on a promotional tour called ""Make Chai Not War,"" Paul said, according to a Wall Street Journal transcript of the exchange. Paul mentioned it again during a later hearing with Clinton’s replacement, former Mass. Senator John Kerry, according to the Washington Post. For the record, Paul’s claim didn’t cite money or motive. Our ruling Paul said ""Hillary Clinton’s State Department sent three comedians to India on the ‘Make Chai Not War tour."" The State Department, while under the leadership of Clinton, did send three Indian-American comics to India in early 2012 as part of a regular cultural exchange program intended to stem religious prejudices and encourage tolerance. The State Department didn’t come up with the name, but the show was indeed called ""Make Chai Not War.""

Sabino ""Pio"" Renteria says 15 years ago, pizzas weren't delivered in East Austin neighborhood
","East Austin neighborhoods near downtown Austin north of Lady Bird Lake have gentrified rapidly, the Austin Chronicle noted in a recent cover story. ""The lower Eastside is increasingly dotted with high-end restaurants and chic bars where homes once stood. Many residents seem surprised at the brisk pace of new development,"" reporter Tony Cantú wrote, going on to say the ""transformation"" started in the early 2000s. There’s ample additional detail. But we chewed on a comment by Sabino ""Pio"" Renteria, a resident elected to the District 3 seat on the Austin City Council in November 2014. After mention of the area’s fluctuating home values, Renteria indicated conditions have noticeably changed. ""Fifteen years ago,"" he said, ""you couldn't even get a pizza delivered in that neighborhood."" Really? To our request for elaboration, Renteria, who lives near Martin Middle School, told us he was referring to the largely residential blocks just east of downtown Austin, specifically the region bounded by Interstate 35 to the west, the lake to the south, Pleasant Valley Road to the east and East Seventh Street to the north, all of which was considered too dangerous for pizza deliveries 15 years ago and earlier, he said by phone. If he wanted a pizza delivered, Renteria said, he had to meet the delivery driver in the parking lot of the lakeside Holiday Inn on the west side of I-35, then drive his pie the several blocks home. ""No one wanted to come into the Eastside,"" he said. Varied accounts We gathered a range of  recollections while looking into this claim: --By phone, Zach Rogers said that in 1999-2000, he was a delivery driver for Pizza Classics, on 29th Street near the University of Texas, and his boss insisted he deliver pizzas everywhere; --Hoover Alexander, 60, who has a landmark restaurant on East Austin’s Manor Road, said by email that while he grew up north of Renteria’s neighborhood and north of 12th Street, ""the collective black & brown neighbors east of IH 35, from the river to Manor Rd., knew we were in the ‘no delivery zone’ that stemmed from the belief that East Austin was unsafe & crime ridden, and there was a fear of drivers getting robbed. Rightly or wrongly, the perception became the reality of no deliveries."" Alexander specified: ""No pizza delivery for my neighborhood for sure until '00 - '05,"" so Alexander would drive about five minutes west to pick up orders. --Jane and Gilberto Rivera, residents of East Austin’s Rosewood neighborhood, north of Renteria’s area, recalled not being able to lure a pizza delivery through the 1990s, though they said it’s possible that changed by 2000. Gilberto Rivera said pizza places on East Riverside Drive south of the lake would hand off their order at a gas station near the Holiday Inn, ""almost like a drug transaction."" Eventually pizza was delivered from a Pizza Hut on Airport Boulevard, he said. Jane Rivera said: ""You can safely say that at least up until 2000, (in) all of East Austin, you could not get pizza delivered."" --East Austin resident Todd Campbell said by phone he could recall not being able to get a pizza delivered to the home he shared with others at Second and Navasota in 2000. Then again, Eastside resident Marisol Prins described Mr. Gatti’s delivering to the area from its downtown location. Prins said pizza stores on Riverside wouldn’t deliver. --Down the street from Renteria’s home, we spoke with Ernest Vargas, 59, who said he couldn’t recall ever not being able to get a pizza delivered. He said his family, which bought its house in 1969, used to get pizzas delivered by Pizza Hut. --Close to I-35, on the western edge of the neighborhood, the principal of Sanchez Elementary School, Azucena Garcia, said by phone she couldn’t recall any trouble getting pizzas delivered over her 23 years at the school. Pizzas were brought by various stores, she said, with the school shopping for deals. By phone, another school employee, Jennifer Riojas-Santos, said that while living and working in the area in the 1990s, she experienced ""very limited"" pizza delivery options--including a Pizza Hut south of the lake, she said. On first pass, then, it appears that pizzas weren’t uniformly delivered in East Austin at some time in the past. Checking telephone books We couldn’t devise a wayback machine for checking 2000-era deliveries. But we test-kitchened an approach by visiting the Austin History Center to pinpoint pizza places that were then arguably close enough to Renteria’s neighborhood to bring a pie. Telephone books for 1999-2000, one published by Southwestern Bell and the other by Great Western Directories, Inc., listed more than 30 Austin pizza restaurants at the time with several saying they delivered--including Domino’s, Little Caesars, and Papa John’s. We also identified a pizza place in Renteria’s neighborhood at the time, La Pizza Loca, which was at 2727 East Seventh. In 1996, in fact, the Chronicle’s food critics credited La Pizza Loca with having the ""best eastside delivery."" The critics also said: ""As those of us who reside east of I-35 can attest, options are pretty slim where dinner delivery is concerned."" Otherwise, according to the phone books, pizza places with delivery closest to Renteria’s neighborhood were downtown west of I-35 (a Pizza Hut at 1201 W. Sixth St.) or along Riverside south of the lake (where University of Texas students already filled multiple apartment complexes): specifically, a Doubledave’s Pizzawork; a Pizza Hut; a Mr. Gatti’s; and a Little Caesars. Noted: Phone-book ads for Papa John’s and Domino’s said delivery wasn’t available everywhere. The Domino’s ad said: ""Delivery area limited to ensure safe driving. Our drivers carry less than $20.00."" In contrast, Mr. Gatti’s, which had more than 20 Austin-area locations, touted its phone number as the ""one number that’s good for pickup and delivery all over Austin."" Spokesman: Gatti’s ‘would have delivered’ We tried to reach representatives of the identified pizza stores; most didn’t engage. But by phone and email, a Gatti’s spokesman insisted its stores on East Riverside and West Sixth made deliveries throughout the Eastside in 1999 and 2000. Ronnie Steck said he’d confirmed that Gatti’s Pizza restaurant #160 on W 6th St. and Rio Grande opened in June 1999, closing in March 2014. ""During that time,"" he wrote, ""our delivery area extended west to the lake in the"" Tarrytown area ""and all the way east to Pleasant Valley, easily encompassing the area in question. In addition, the Oltorf location we had at the time picked up any delivery needs that fell south of the #160 delivery area."" ""We’ve been serving pizza to people all throughout this great city for going on 46 years and we’ve certainly witnessed and marveled at the rapid change happening on the East side. That said, had Council Member Renteria called 459-2222, Gatti’s would have gladly delivered,"" Steck said. Asked if the pizza chain was concerned about the safety of its drivers in the neighborhood, Steck said not, adding: ""That gentrification didn’t just happen yesterday."" We alerted Renteria’s office to Steck’s comments and didn’t hear back from him. A store owner’s recollection To our inquiry, a founder and former owner of Austin’s Pizza, Clay McLaughlin, said by phone its first store opened in 1999 at 12th Street and West Avenue near the main campus of Austin Community College west of downtown Austin. McLaughlin said that store, like nearby competitors, did not deliver east of I-35. ""We really tried to stay more toward campus,"" he said. ""To be totally candid, I don’t know that was our market."" Also, he said, ""safety was definitely a concern. Going up to somebody’s house, cash in the pocket... we didn’t want to get any of our drivers in jeopardy,"" he said. Our ruling Renteria said that 15 years ago, you couldn’t get a pizza delivered in his neighborhood just east of downtown Austin. We see a dash of truth here; not every pizza place delivered there at the time and earlier, into the 1990s, you evidently couldn’t get a pizza delivered at all. But it looks to us like you could get a pizza delivered 15 years ago if you knew which vendors to call. We rate the claim Mostly False.

"['Georgia', 'Congress', 'Terrorism', 'David Perdue']","
Perdue mostly right on shady weapons deal
","The White House announced last week that President Barack Obama would be eliminating a major obstacle to the restoration of diplomatic relations with Cuba by removing it from America’s list of state sponsors of terrorism. Since 1982, Cuba has been on the State Department’s list of state sponsors of terrorism, a designation it has shared with Syria, Sudan and Iran and that triggers sanctions limiting U.S. aid, defense exports and certain financial transactions. Supporters say this is a necessary step if Obama is going to turn the page on the Cold War-era dispute that has snarled diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Cuba for more than five decades. Some Republicans, including freshman U.S. Sen. David Perdue of Georgia, object to taking Cuba off the list of state sponsors of terrorism. ""The Castro regime, time and again, has violated international norms,’ Perdue, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in a statement issued the day after the White House announcement. ""I am deeply concerned that President Obama continues to embolden our enemies and empower dictators from Russia to Iran, and now Cuba. Cuba must prove it is willing to change its destructive and oppressive behavior before the United States removes it as a state sponsor of terrorism. He cited several examples of Cubas destructive and oppressive behavior, including an incident in 2013 when, he said, Cuba secretly shipped 240 metric tons of weapons to North Korea, violating a U.N.embargo. PolitiFact Georgia decided to fact-check Perdue’s statement about the weapons shipment. We reached out to Mark Bednar, a Perdue spokesman, who sent us several news accounts of the incident where aging Cuban weapons were found aboard a North Korean-flagged ship. In July 2013, Fox News reported that Panamanian officials stopped the ship Chong Chon Gang ferrying undeclared weapons and armaments, including two Soviet-era MiG fighters and surface-to-air missile system, from Cuba, in apparent violation of U.N. sanctions. The weapons were hidden under 200,000 bags of sugar. The report said the Cuban government acknowledged about a day later that the cargo included 240 metric tons of ""obsolete defensive weapons."" Government officials claimed the equipment was meant to be repaired in North Korea and returned to Cuba. Three members of the ship’s crew were arrested on arms trafficking charges. The ship was allowed to return to Cuba in 2014 after a $700,000 fine was paid, the BBC reported. A State Department spokesperson told us this week that the administration considers the weapons shipment to North Korea in 2013 an ""egregious violation of U.N. sanctions."" The administration, the spokesperson said, has worked to ensure that those responsible ""pay a price for their wrongdoing."" ""The administration also worked to maximize the diplomatic cost to Cuba for its role in the incident, including repeatedly condemning Cuba’s role in the violation in meetings of the UN Security Council,"" she said. ""While Cuba’s actions were a clear violation of international law, they do not constitute support for acts of international terrorism and do not constitute a bar to rescission of their (state sponsor of terrorism) designation."" Cuban was placed on the list in 1982 because of its efforts to promote revolution in the Western Hemisphere. North Korea spent 20 years on the list but was removed in 2008 by President George W. Bush. North Korea was placed on the list in 1988 for planting a bomb on a passenger plane headed from Baghdad to Seoul. The plane exploded south of Burma, and all on board were killed. In the current review of Cuba’s standing, the administration focused on ‘the narrow question of whether Cuba provided any support for international terrorism during the previous six months and whether Cuba has provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future, consistent with the statutory standard for rescission,"" the State Department spokeswoman said.. A senior administration official told reporters earlier this month that Cuban leaders, including Fidel and Raul Castro, have repeatedly and publicly decried terrorist acts. Congress has 45 days from receiving the president’s report to pass a joint resolution prohibiting the rescission. If that would occur, the president would have veto power and Congress the power of the veto override. Our conclusion Georgia Sen. David Perdue said he objects to plans to take Cuba off the list of state sponsors of terrorism, a move that was announced last week by the White House. He said that the Castro regime in Cuba has violated international norms. Among the specific examples he cited was Cuba ""secretly shipping 240 metric tons of weapons to North Korea in 2013 in violation of a U.N. embargo."" News reports and statements from the administration back up Perdue’s claim about the incident. The administration said it narrowly focused on whether Cuban provided any support for international terrorism in the prior six months and whether the Cuban government had provided assurances that it will not support acts of international terrorism in the future, That is context the reader needs. For that reason, we rate Perdue's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097242800>],/factchecks/2015/apr/24/david-perdue/Perdue-mostly-right-on-shady-weapons-deal/
"['Taxes', 'PunditFact', 'Bill Maher']","
Bill Maher says more Americans have been to the moon than farmers who paid the estate tax in 2013
","Liberal comedian Bill Maher made an out-of-this-world comparison to poke a hole in the Republican argument that the estate tax threatens the livelihoods of ""family farmers."" Of 5,000 Americans who paid the estate tax in 2013, ""20 farmers paid it,"" Maher said on his April 17, 2015, show. ""Twenty-four Americans have been to the moon."" ""More astronauts have been to the moon than farmers who paid the inheritance tax in 2013."" There obviously is no relation between the number of farmers paying the estate tax and the number of Americans who went to the moon, but as a point of trivia, Maher’s claim is an intriguing one. A reader asked us to ""do the magic that you do,"" which is determining whether Maher’s point is accurate. One small step for fact-checkers ... Caveat No 1: Maher is using the number of astronauts who have been to the vicinity of the moon, not just the number of moonwalkers. Twelve Americans have walked the moon’s surface over six Apollo missions, starting with Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin planting an American flag in 1969. (If you’re not sure about whether the lunar landing really happened, you won’t like this fact-check, but you may enjoy these bona fide moon misconceptions.) Add another 12 American astronauts who orbited the moon but did not walk on it, and you get  24. NASA chief historian William Barry said the 24 Americans is a solid figure in that it doesn’t double count Americans who made more than one lunar trip. ""There were several astronauts who flew to the Moon and orbited it on one mission and then were lucky enough to go back and land on it on a later mission,"" Barry said. Jim Lovell, for instance, made two trips to the moon in Apollo 8 and Apollo 13, but he never walked on it. (In this Smithsonian picture, Lovell and his crew emerge from the U.S.S. Iwo Jima after landing the spacecraft Apollo 13 in the South Pacific.)  … One giant leap for the truth  What Maher calls the ""inheritance tax"" and what Republicans call the ""death tax"" is more accurately described as the estate tax. Some wealthy families face this tax when they pass on assets (cash, land, homes, stocks, etc.) to heirs after death. Most estates do not owe estate taxes. It affects about 5,500 Americans whose estates exceed the exemption limit of $5.43 million per person. If the estate is worth more than that, an heir could pay a tax rate up to 40 percent on the value of the estate above that limit. Even though it doesn’t affect all that many people, it brings in big bucks for the government. Repealing it would cost about $270 billion over the next decade, according to the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation. In the week ahead of Maher’s April 17 show, House Republicans approved a plan to eliminate the estate tax, saying it ""can prove devastating to families — forcing them to sell land, lay off workers, and even shut down entirely."" So did this tax really affect just ""20 farmers"" in 2013, as Maher said? The number comes from an estimate by the Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. Tax Policy Center economists wanted to get an idea of how the tax would affect estates, including those with farm and business assets, in 2013. All of their numbers are estimates based on the center’s estate tax model. They defined family farms and businesses as estates having farm or business assets less than $5 million and half of the estate. These farms and businesses had taxable returns and total assets between $5 million and up $10 million. ""It’s a definition that hones in on small farms and business — the most relevant in responding to the myth that many small farms and small businesses must be liquidated to pay estate tax,"" said Brandon DeBot, a research assistant at the federal fiscal policy division of the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Using the Tax Policy Center’s model, an estimated 20 small farms and small businesses would have had to pay the estate tax in 2013, amounting to a total of $6.9 million of tax with an average tax rate of 4.9 percent. So that’s not just small farms, it’s small farms and small businesses, which might not be a farm. Caveat No. 2: The number of farms and businesses is probably not exactly 20, as it is an estimate rounded to the nearest multiple of 10. That means the number is anywhere from 16-24. Caveat No. 3: Maher talked about ""family farmers,"" addressing the Republican argument about the plight of farmers who could lose their livelihood because of the estate tax. But family farms can be big farms, and that’s where things get more complicated. Maher set up his comparison by discussing the plight of family farmers, but then later dropped the word ""family."" That one word is important. The Tax Policy Center broadened the scope to include all farm and business estates, regardless of size, with at least half of their value from farm business activity. By that method, 120 farm and business estates would have had to pay the estate tax in 2013, said Roberton Williams, a Tax Policy Center fellow who worked on the model. Alan D. Viard, a resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute who studies federal tax and budget policy, says the the estate tax has a lot of flaws, but the effect on farmers is ""just not the right grounds to criticize this tax."" Maher’s point was strong, he said. In 2001, House Republicans voted to repeal the ""death tax."" New York Times reporter David Cay Johnston scoured 1999 IRS filings, phoned the American Farm Bureau Federation, and interviewed farmers in effort to find examples of working farmers who lost their farms because of estate taxes. He found none, writing that the reality of who is bitten by the estate tax ""is different from the mythology,"" as ""the overwhelming majority of beneficiaries are the heirs of people who made their fortunes through their businesses and investments in securities and real estate."" And in 2001, the estate tax was more robust than it is now, with a lower exemption level of $675,000 and a higher top tax rate of 55 percent. ""It is a small number, bottom line,"" Williams said. ""They’re going to be the exception rather than the rule."" Our ruling Maher compared 24 American astronauts who ""have been to the moon"" to 20 farmers whom he said were the only ones to pay the estate tax. His count for astronauts who ""have been to the moon"" is reasonable, counting both American moonwalkers and those who have flown in its orbit during various Apollo missions. The larger point about only 20 farmers paying the estate tax is a little more complicated. A 2013 nonpartisan study found 20 small farms and small businesses faced the estate tax in 2013. Maher referred to ""family farms"" in setting up his claim. Saying small farms would have been better. And he dropped ""family"" in later references. Experts said Maher generally could have been more careful in his wording, but that his bit of trivia largely checks out, as does his point that the estate tax affects very few small farmers. We rate his claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2edf78cd-008c-408e-ae35-939322661e70",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FA5580>],/factchecks/2015/apr/23/bill-maher/bill-maher-says-more-americans-have-been-moon-farm/

'With certainty' cap-and-trade would wreck the economy, Rubio says
","It’s no secret that Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is skeptical of human-caused climate change. While he’s unsure of the effect humans have on the climate, Rubio is certain that addressing the problem would wreck the economy. ""If we do the things they want us to do, cap and trade, you name it, how much will that change the pace of climates change vs. how much will it cost to our economy?"" Rubio asked rhetorically on CBS’ Face the Nation April 19. ""Scientists can't tell us what impact it would have on reversing these changes. But I can tell you with certainty it would have a devastating impact on our economy."" We wondered about Rubio’s claim that it’s a ""certainty"" that cap and trade would ""devastate"" the economy. Rubio has a point in that scientists can’t say exactly how much of an effect cap and trade would have on climate change trends. But predictions about cap and trade on the economy carry the same level of uncertainty -- a lot depends on the specifics of the policy. Additionally, most estimations show a modest -- rather than ""devastating"" -- impact. We reached out to Rubio’s staff but didn’t hear back. Devastation? Cap and trade is a simple concept: The government sets a cap on carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions that contribute to climate change. To comply, companies must either upgrade to cleaner technologies or purchase allowances to continue polluting. Proponents say that because emissions would cost companies more, it’s in their interest to find ways to limit their pollution, through new technology or otherwise. Critics say cap and trade would cause companies to slow down production or pass along additional costs to customers. Quite a few states already have cap-and-trade programs, such as the Northeast Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative among 10 states, as well as the Western Climate Initiative, which includes several states (primarily California) and parts of Canada. The European Union has a cap-and-trade program among its member nations. Existing cap-and-trade programs haven’t devastated their local economies. For example, an independent consulting firm looked at the economic impact of the group of Northeastern states engaged in a cap-and-trade program that has lowered emissions by 40 percent since 2005, and the results were positive. The 2011 analysis found that the program created $1.6 billion in value added to the regional economy. It also created 16,000 jobs, and residents collectively saved more than $1 billion on energy bills. Depending on the policy specifics, different programs would have different effects on the economy and climate change, said Duke University energy policy professor Billy Pizer, though the ideal policy would seek to balance costs and benefits. ""Europe, California, New England—they all have cap and trade and nothing has been devastated,"" Pizer said. ""There is nothing about a generic cap and trade that is devastating."" The European Union program has struggled over the past few years -- in part due to the global recession and falling carbon prices on the continent. However, a 2012 report out of the Environmental Defense Fund found that costs were significantly lower than predicted. The report cited another study that found the program ""did not significantly affect"" employment, profits or added value. Joseph Aldy, an energy policy professor at Harvard University, pointed out that former President George H.W. Bush established a cap-and-trade program designed to mitigate acid rain. A recent study out of Harvard found that the program created annual benefits of up to $116 billion, compared to just $2 billion in costs -- mostly as a result of public health improvements. For a national cap-and-trade program, estimates of economic impact are all over the map. Consider the analyses of a failed 2009 proposal for a federal cap-and trade program and their effect on household costs. The Congressional Budget Office, Congress’ independent research arm, found the bill would cost about $175 per household annually. The conservative Heritage Foundation predicted instead a much higher cost: $1,241 per household annually. On the other end of the spectrum, the American Council for an Energy-Efficiency Economy estimated that a family could save $750 after the bill had been in effect for eight years. Economic benefits from cap and trade could come from more energy-efficient technology and less climate-change related costs, according to advocates. For example, the 2010 Economic Report from the President said the 2009 congressional proposal could save the economy up to $2 trillion as a result of avoided damages from more intense climate change. The Energy Information Administration, a statistical office within the U.S. Energy Department, looked at the cap-and-trade proposal and found that the macroeconomic effects were minimal -- with the bill, economic growth by 2035 would be 0.3 percent less than it would be absent the bill. They also found that a later cap-and-trade proposal would have a similar effect. We should note that one expert -- Patrick Michaels, director of the Center for the Study of Science at the libertarian Cato Institute -- told us the 2009 proposal would have been ""devastating"" to the economy because it involved unacheivable goals and assumed the eventual invention of technology that doesn’t exist yet. Michaels, a climatologist, noted though that this wouldn’t be the case for every cap-and-trade policy. ""It is political hyperbole to say that the impacts would be ‘devastating,’ "" said Gilbert Metcalf, a professor of public finance at Tufts University. ""I agree with Rubio that the economic impacts are probably easier to forecast than the climate impacts; (the economic impacts) are just not what he is saying they are."" Our ruling Rubio said, ""I can tell you with certainty (cap and trade) would have a devastating impact on our economy."" Existing cap-and-trade programs have not proven to be ""devastating"" in their economic impact. While estimates for proposed programs vary, most experts and analysts have found modest potential  impact on the economy; some even show a positive impact. Based on the evidence, Rubio can’t be certain about the potential impact of cap and trade. We rate his claim False. Note: This claim was fact-checked as part of a reward to our Kickstarter campaign to live fact-check the 2015 State of the Union.

Martin O'Malley says Congress won't see Pacific trade deal before they vote on it
","President Barack Obama’s efforts to pursue a landmark trade agreement with countries on the Pacific Rim has split his own party. Obama is seeking to finalize an agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The deal has been in negotiation since 2009 between the United States, Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam. Combined, these countries account for roughly 40 percent of the world’s economy. Trade deals often draw opposition from the left, due in part to concerns from labor unions -- a key Democratic-leaning constituency. For this reason, Obama’s push for the deal has forced Democratic officeholders and candidates to decide whether or not they will back the president’s agenda. Martin O’Malley, the former Maryland governor who is a potential presidential candidate, took a strong stand against pursuing such a deal during an interview with NPR on April 20, 2015, saying the public wouldn’t get to read the agreement before it was approved. Here’s the excerpt that aired; a longer version with more back-and-forth is available as a transcript on the NPR website. Inskeep: ""Let me ask about another issue on which Democrats seem to be divided. You have said in recent days that you oppose the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal that would tie a dozen nations, including the United States, into free trade. What's wrong with that?"" O’Malley: ""Yeah, I do oppose it. What's wrong with it is first and foremost that we're not allowed to read it before representatives vote on it. What's wrong with it is that right now what we should be doing are things that make our economy stronger here at home. And that's my concern, that the Trans-Pacific Partnership, this deal, is a race to the bottom, a chasing of lower wages abroad. And I believe that that does nothing to help us build a stronger economy here at home."" A reader asked us to take a closer look at whether Americans won’t get to read the deal before Congress casts a vote on it. So we did. As we discussed this question with trade experts, we concluded that O’Malley’s problem was conflating two pieces of legislation -- Trade Promotion Authority and the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Despite their similar acronyms (TPA and TPP), they are different, with different degrees of transparency. Trade Promotion Authority, sometimes informally known as ""fast-track,"" is a method for putting trade agreements before Congress. If Congress passes Trade Promotion Authority legislation, it’s granting the president broad leeway to negotiate a trade agreement. Once the executive branch finalizes a deal with its foreign counterparts, Congress will have a separate up-or-down vote to ratify the agreement, in the process, changing U.S. law to fit the agreement’s provisions. This second bill must be considered under streamlined procedural rules and voted on without any amendments from lawmakers. The bill introduced in Congress on April 16, 2015, was for Trade Promotion Authority, giving Obama the right to strike a deal and laying out the process for voting on the agreement once the administration finalizes it. Since the Trans-Pacific Partnership is the only significant trade deal that’s likely to be sent to Congress anytime soon, these two bills are intertwined. But their distinctions are important -- including the degree of transparency before each vote, which is the part that O’Malley was referencing. At the time Congress votes on whether to grant Trade Promotion Authority to Obama, the details of the Trans-Pacific Partnership won’t be known yet. But if Trade Promotion Authority is passed, and if the Obama administration succeeds in striking a deal, then the provisions of the deal will emerge before lawmakers cast the second vote. So in a strict sense, what O’Malley said is wrong. When lawmakers vote on the actual Trans-Pacific Partnership -- the second vote -- they will indeed have the full details of what the deal entails. The confusion enters because when Congress casts the first vote -- the one currently on Congress’ agenda, to empower Obama to strike the deal -- they won’t yet know the details of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. That’s the way the process was designed to work. Congress votes first to authorize the negotiations, and then votes a second time  -- weeks, months or even years later -- on whether to approve the agreement produced by the negotiations it authorized. ""There is congressional input into the negotiations as they proceed, but the negotiations take place behind closed doors and are not made open to the public or all members of Congress,"" said Robert M. Stern, an emeritus professor of economics and public policy at the University of Michigan. ""There may be a democratic deficit, but if the details of the negotiations were publicly available, there would likely be endless discussion and debates about various parts of the negotiations."" That sticks in the craw of critics, including O’Malley. Doing it this way puts lawmakers in an uncomfortable position -- they are being asked to approve a process that will produce a bill they won’t have the ability to amend when it comes up for a vote later.  O’Malley ""believes that Congress and the American people should be able to read the agreement before Congress votes on giving away their authority -- our authority -- to change it,"" his staff said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""The deal will not be made public until after fast track is approved -- and then at that point, there can be no changes. That leaves the general public in the dark."" O’Malley does have a point that transparency has been lacking so far. Negotiations on the Trans-Pacific Partnership have been under way for years, even before passage of Trade Promotion Authority, but they’ve been conducted with extreme secrecy. In fact, much of what the public knows about them so far comes from draft documents obtained and publicized by Wikileaks. And under the Trade Promotion Authority bill now being considered in Congress, ""detailed and timely information"" will be shared with lawmakers and staff with ""proper security clearances as appropriate."" Even before passage of Trade Promotion Authority, the Obama administration said, lawmakers and staff with security clearances have access to negotiating texts and summaries and has held hundreds of briefings. Some House Democrats say that isn’t enough enough openness. Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-Conn., told The Hill that the administration is being ""needlessly secretive. … Even now, when they are finally beginning to share details of the proposed deal with members of Congress, they are denying us the ability to consult with our staff or discuss details of the agreement with experts."" Our ruling O’Malley said that ""we're not allowed to read it (the Trans-Pacific Partnership) before representatives vote on it."" Strictly speaking, he’s wrong -- Congress, and the American public, will be fully informed of what’s in the Trans-Pacific Partnership before lawmakers vote to make the agreement part of United States law. But he has a point that lawmakers won’t know what’s in the Trans-Pacific Partnership before they cast a separate, precursor vote -- the vote to authorize Obama to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership on a fast-track basis in the first place. In a meandering radio conversation, O’Malley made a reasonable point that transparency about the deal has been lacking, but in doing so, he conflated two separate congressional votes. On balance, we rate his claim Mostly False. UPDATE, Apr. 25, 2015: This version adds additional information from the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative regarding the transparency policies afforded members of Congress prior to the passage of Trade Promotion Authority.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097695080>],/factchecks/2015/apr/23/martin-omalley/martin-omalley-says-congress-wont-see-pacific-trad/
