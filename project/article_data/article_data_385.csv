Bike Austin says bike lanes, sidewalks reduce Austin crashes up to 38 percent
","CLARIFICATION, 3:46 p.m., Sept. 9, 2016: Shortly after this fact check posted, we revised a sentence to say that we didn't find research tying the addition of simple bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. We'd originally said we didn't see research generally tying bike lanes to crash reductions. Our rating of the group's claim didn't change. After a 14-year-old bicyclist was hit by a car and killed in Austin in June 2016, local nonprofit Bike Austin called on the city to make streets safer for bicyclists and pedestrians. In a statement, the group’s executive director, Mercedes Feris, said: ""Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets."" Does that hold up? Group cites city report To our inquiry, Feris cited a 2015 City of Austin report, ""Redesigning the Street: A Report on Right-Sizing Projects in Austin, TX 1999-2014,"" analyzing the effects of a certain kind of project, called a road diet, designed to make streets safer by shrinking opportunities to drive too fast. In what the Federal Highway Administration calls the classic example of a road diet, lane lines on a four-lane road that has two lanes in each direction are repainted to create a three-lane road, leaving a single lane in each direction and a center lane solely for left turns. A 2014 agency guide to road diets says the concept developed decades ago in response to the expansion-minded road construction of the 1950s and 1960s, when two-lane roads were frequently upgraded to four lanes. One of the first road diets, the guide says, was applied in 1979 to a four-lane road in Billings, Montana. On that road, where about 10,000 cars drove every day, the shrinkage to three lanes was found to reduce crashes without increasing delays. We dug into Austin’s more recent report and checked with experts on road diets and bicycle transportation. From that, we found that such projects often incorporate new bike lanes -- but they don’t typically add sidewalks. Generally, too, the highway administration has found that crashes in which a car hits a pedestrian walking on the side of the road consistently fall by more than 50 percent when sidewalks are installed. We failed to identify research tying the addition of simple, striped bike lanes to specific percentage reductions in crashes. The cited city report covers 37 local road diets completed from 1999 through 2014, including the one that Feris pointed out, on a 1.6-mile stretch of Manor Road in Northeast Austin. It resulted, the report says, in a 38 percent drop in crashes. A city spokeswoman, Marissa Monroy, responded to our inquiry about the research, saying by email the 38 percent reduction in any kind of crash ties to nearly six years of data collected by the Austin Police Department before and after the road diet took place on the stretch of Manor Road between Theo Drive and East 51st Street in November 2010.  A close-up aerial view from along the noted 1.6-mile segment of Manor Road after the road diet was completed. The road includes bike lanes and the hallmark of a road diet project: a center two-way left-turn lane. SOURCE: Google Earth. Monroy told us that in the three years before the project, from November 2007 through October 2010, the to-be-reconfigured section had 39 crashes involving any combination of motor vehicles, bicycles and pedestrians--adding up to one pedestrian death and 16 injury crashes involving motor vehicles. In the three years after the project, from December 2010 through November 2013, she said, the stretch had 24 crashes -- or 38.5 percent fewer -- with no fatalities and 14 injury crashes, one involving a pedestrian, two affecting bicyclists. It’s also worth mentioning, as the city report says, that bike traffic on the segment increased 180 percent, from 54 bikes tallied in a 24-hour period before the project (and its bike lanes) was completed with 151 bikes in a similar period after. The full report presents general crash-reduction analyses for five of the 37 projects. Among the five, it sums up, ""right-sizing projects,"" or road diets, contributed to at least 22 percent fewer crashes, on Amherst Drive, up to the nearly 39 percent reduction on the Manor Road stretch. We calculated the average of the five: 28.8 percent fewer crashes. Expert: Road diets reduce accidents For outside perspective, we reached out to the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, hearing back about road diets, bike lanes and sidewalks from Joan Hudson, an associate research engineer. Hudson advised that the noted 38 percent reduction in crashes falls in line with national research she’s reviewed, also pointing us to the highway administration and the National Cooperative Highway Research Program -- a division of the Transportation Research Board, which is part of the National Academies of Science, Engineering and Medicine. Each agency highlights the same two studies finding ""the road-diet treatment had a significant effect"" in reducing crashes, as the cooperative research program said in a 2008 report. The reductions ranged from 19 to 47 percent, with an average of 29 percent. Hudson said road diets make roads safer for a few reasons: additional space improves reaction time, and a narrower roadway tends to reduce how fast drivers go, making crashes less severe. Road diets also make bicyclists more comfortable, she said, because they have dedicated space instead of sharing lanes with cars. The city’s report also reflected these points. Hudson confirmed that most road diets include bike lanes, but said sidewalks -- posing greater costs than what it takes to revise lane lines -- are hardly ever included. (It looks to us like a sidewalk may have been installed on the Manor Road stretch. To our query, Monroy said she couldn’t confirm it was part of the related road-diet project.) And by phone, Hudson told us that determining how much road diets reduce crashes involving bicyclists or pedestrians is hard because there’s not much data measuring bicycle and pedestrian traffic before and after roads are relined. It may be, for instance, she said, that bike accidents escalate after a project is completed largely because more bicyclists use the added bike lanes. That looks to us like what happened on the on the Manor Road stretch, where bike traffic more than doubled with bike crashes only slightly going up. Bike lanes alone? We wondered if perhaps bike lanes alone result in double-digit crash reductions. To our inquiry, a University of Wisconsin urban planning professor, Robert Schneider, said by email that ""it is difficult to make a specific statement"" about how a particular bike lane reduces crashes, because that’s not what researches examine. Schneider, who teaches about pedestrian and bike safety, said research tends to be broader, looking at what experts call ""networks"" -- routes through whole cities or significant parts of cities -- to determine how easy and safe it is to get around on a bike. Research examining those networks, Schneider said, shows that bike-friendly cities help drivers, bicyclists and pedestrians stay safe. He cited a 2011 study from two engineers at the University of Colorado-Denver finding that when intersections and roads are easier for cyclists to navigate and more cyclists hit the road, drivers tend to slow down and be more aware of their surroundings. A Bike Austin leader, Miller Nuttle, informed of our findings, said its claim wasn’t worded as precisely as it should have been. Our ruling Bike Austin said: ""Bike lanes and sidewalks have been proven to reduce crashes by up to 38 percent on Austin’s streets."" Research suggests big drops in pedestrian-vehicle accidents when sidewalks are introduced. But Bike Austin didn’t offer nor did we find research showing the addition of bike lanes in themselves or bike lanes plus sidewalks resulted in any percentage plummet in crashes. Instead, the city analysis states that reconfiguring lanes on part of one road, which also gained bike lanes, preceded 38 percent fewer crashes--with crash reductions averaging 29 percent among five road-diet projects. We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/17fb7c14-9a39-45dd-a42d-d4fdaae3d443",[<zip object at 0x0000028097066E80>],/factchecks/2016/jul/29/bike-austin/bike-austin-says-bike-lanes-sidewalks-reduce-austi/

Cecile Richards makes Half True claim about Barack Obama winning with record gender gap
","Texas-born Cecile Richards enjoyed sitting next to President Bill Clinton in the crowd on the scene watching the first night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. ""How awesome is that,"" Richards said to Texas delegates at a hotel breakfast the next morning. The eldest daughter of the late Gov. Ann Richards drew our attention with a declaration about women making history compared with men in their relative support for Barack Obama four years ago. Richards, who leads the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, noted that Obama that fall stressed his support for the women’s health care and abortion provider in debate with Republican Mitt Romney. ""Of course, President Obama ended up getting re-elected by the largest gender gap ever in the history of American elections. And we’re going to do even better this time,"" she said. We don’t check predictions. But we were curious if Obama enjoyed the biggest ""gender gap"" in presidential election history. We tried to ask Richards how she reached her conclusion and didn’t draw a response. Gallup's analysis Separately, we reached out to Celinda Lake, a Democratic strategist and pollster; her office sent an email pointing out a November 2012 Gallup press release stating that Obama ""won the two-party vote among female voters in the 2012 election by 12 points, 56 percent to 44 percent, over Republican challenger Mitt Romney. Meanwhile, Romney won among men by an eight-point margin, 54% to 46%."" The release continued: ""That total 20-point gender gap is the largest Gallup has measured in a presidential election since it began compiling the vote by major subgroups in 1952,"" the release said. The second-largest gap in the period, of 18 percentage points, traces to the 1984 election won by Ronald Reagan, Gallup said. A footnote to Gallup’s chart (below) says the gap was calculated according to results of Gallup polls taken just before each election indicating how well each Democratic presidential nominee was preferred by women against how poorly the Democrat polled among men.                  SOURCE: Press release, ""Gender Gap in 2012 Vote Is Largest in Gallup's History,"" Gallup, Nov. 9, 2012 Better ways to gauge? Separately to our inquiries, polling experts told us other ways of measuring the gender gap among voters in presidential elections are more widely accepted. By email, Susan Carroll, a senior scholar at the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University, commented: ""Gallup and others make the calculation needlessly complicated by combining figures for both candidates."" By email, Daron Shaw of the University of Texas called Gallup’s calculation ""a particular (contentious) stat from one organization that is NOT corroborated by any other groups."" Debbie Walsh, the center’s director, pointed us to a 2012 center ""fact sheet"" presenting the gender gap as measured by voter exit polls  in each presidential election from 1980 through 2012. By phone, she said Richards might prove right about the 2016 Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, potentially winning with the biggest gender gap ever. But, Walsh said, she doesn’t think Richards was right about Obama’s 2012 gap. The center’s sheet says: ""A gender gap in voting refers to a difference between the percentage of women and the percentage of men voting for a given candidate, generally the winning candidate. Even when men and women favor the same candidate, they may do so by different margins, resulting in a gender gap."" The presentation continues: ""In every election since 1980, a gender gap has been apparent, with a greater proportion of women than men preferring the Democrat in each case."" And in 2012, according to the sheet, 55 percent of women and 45 percent of men favored Obama, making for a gender gap of 10 percentage points. But that wasn’t the biggest gender gap over the nine analyzed elections. In 1996, President Bill Clinton experienced an 11 percentage point gender gap, winning re-election with 54 percent of women favoring him compared with 43 percent of men, according to the Voter News Service. In 2000, according to the service, ultimately victorious Republican George W. Bush won the support of 53 percent of men compared with 43 percent of women, leaving a gender gap of 10 percentage points--meaning, Walsh told us, women were 10 percentage points less likely than men to vote for him. Al Gore drew votes from 54 percent of women, according to the service, and 42 percent of men. Other victors for president, according to the sheet, prevailed with gender gaps ranging from four percentage points (Clinton in 1992) to eight points (Ronald Reagan in 1980). Shaw further urged us to consider a 2006 research paper, ""The Gender Gap,"" by researcher Karen M. Kaufmann. Kaufmann’s paper defines ""gender gap"" by focusing on how the Democratic nominee, win or lose, polls among women and men. The paper says: ""While there are a number of ways to measure the gender gap, the most common measure subtracts the percentage of men who identify with the Democratic Party from the percentage of Democratic women."" We ran this focus past other experts including Walsh, who said her approach is the preferred way to measure the gap, and Jim Henson, who with Shaw co-directs the University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll; Henson said by email he thinks Kaufmann’s definition is more commonly used. For her part, Kaufmann, a visiting lecturer at UCLA’s Luskin School of Public Policy, said by email that while there’s a ""weak consensus"" among experts about how to measure the gender gap, the ""reason the Democratic gap is typically the standard, is that it was male movement away from the Democratic Party that created the gap initially and the fluctuation in the gap is typically reflected in the movement of white men to and from Democratic candidates."" According to the paper, the alignment of more women with the Democratic Party started with the election of Lyndon B. Johnson in 1964--with the gap growing over time, in great part due to white men aligning more with the Republican Party. ""Men are more conservative than women across a number of important political domains,"" Kaufmann wrote. She also said: ""Beyond the significance of attitudes, research also suggests that, at times, men and women attach varying levels of priority to certain political issues,"" with those decisions widening or narrowing the gender gap. Kaufmann found the gender gap among Southern women diminishing through the elections of 1996 through 2004 with the gap in the rest of the country staying relatively constant, per data from the American National Election Studies, a project overseen by researchers at the University of Michigan and Stanford University that has surveyed people about voting after every presidential election since 194852. The paper came out, of course, before Obama won for president. So, it doesn’t precisely extend to what we’re checking. Post-election poll results since 1948 So, we reached out to the ANES for relevant results and Patricia Luevano emailed us its breakout suggesting that in each of the 13 elections from 1964 through 2012, more women than men reported having voted for the Democratic nominee. Over those elections, the breakout indicates, the widest gender gap--again, the difference between the shares of women versus men who reported voting for the Democrat--opened up in 1996 when 60 percent of women recalled voting for Clinton compared to 46 percent of men. The second-widest gap, nine percentage points, occurred in 1992 (Clinton) and 2000 (Al Gore), according to the breakout. According to the breakout, Obama’s gender gap of 2012 was six percentage points; 55 percent of women said they’d voted for him compared to 49 percent of men. That gap trailed the gaps indicated by the project’s results for 1984 and 2004 (eight percentage points each) and 1988 (seven percentage points), in the end tying for fifth among the 13 elections with six-point gaps in 1972 and 1980. Luevano also shared a breakout showing the gender gap for each winner of the presidency from 1948 on--and indicating three elections in which the winner had a bigger gender gap than what the project found for Obama in 2012: Clinton in 1996 (14 percentage points); Clinton in 1992 (10 points); and Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1956 (seven points; as with Clinton and Obama, that much of a greater share of women reported voting for him than men). Our ruling Richards said that Obama in 2012  ""ended up getting re-elected by the largest gender gap in the history of American elections."" Such data doesn’t appear to be available for all presidential elections. Otherwise, Gallup’s unusual approach to calculating the gender gap for Democratic presidential nominees places Obama No. 1 since 1952 with a 14-point gap in 2012. But other reasonable methodologies show that since 1948, other candidates and victors (even Ike) had greater gender gaps. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"['Agriculture', 'Texas', 'Jeannette Vaught']","
Researcher rounds up wrong figure on Texas cattle
","From the citrus of the Rio Grande Valley to the peaches of the Texas Hill Country, many crops flourish across the vast expanse of the Lone Star State. Ask just about anybody about Texas agriculture, however, and the first offering that often comes to mind is beef. In a May 4, 2016 op-ed article in the Austin American-Statesman, University of Texas lecturer Jeannette Vaught suggested that’s not coincidental. Her dissertation on the same subject is being published as a book. She argued that the promotion of beef culture, in part by politicians such as the Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller, means it’s recognized as the epitome of Texas agriculture. Even though, she writes, it hails predominantly from one part of the state and economically benefits a small region. This obscures the actual diversity of agricultural production in Texas, she said. Vaught wrote that only five counties out of the state’s 254 account for almost 90 percent of the state’s cattle industry.   With almost any drive beyond the state’s urban areas incomplete without a few cow sightings, we wondered if the state’s beef cattle are concentrated in just a few counties. Vaught, asked to provide factual backup, said she relied on Texas statistics posted by the National Agricultural Statistics Service in the U.S. Department of Agriculture. ""It's arresting,"" Vaught said by email, ""because cows are visible everywhere! But they are super concentrated in feedlots in the counties surrounding Lubbock."" Feedlots are designated lots of land where cattle are given a specific type of feed  before slaughter. We sought to check on the data on the NASS Quick Stats website, learning that the agency annually surveys some 38,000 cattle producers to gauge the state of the country’s cattle industry by mail, phone, online and in face-to-face interviews. For the 2015 survey behind Vaught’s claim, producers were asked to report cattle inventories based on Jan. 1, 2016 counts. To our inquiry, Michael Klamm, a cattle statistician with NASS, walked us through the database to those latest counts. Separately, we reached out to the Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association, the largest and oldest livestock association in the state, to see if Vaught’s claim sounded familiar. Laramie Adams, director of public affairs for the group, told us by phone that the NASS data is the complete source for cattle data. We checked back with Klamm at NASS, who wrote back that the inventory category we used included all cattle, both dairy and beef cattle. From our analysis, the five counties with the largest cattle counts (Deaf Smith, Castro, Parmer, Hartley and Hansford), as of January 2016 had a total of 1,980,000 head of cattle out of a total 11,700,000 in the state, or 16.9 percent. While those counties lie in the state’s Panhandle region, at most a three-hour drive from Lubbock, the counties don’t account for anywhere close to the 90 percent Vaught tied to just five counties. By our calculation, the federally collected counts place 90 percent of Texas cattle across 157 counties, spread from regions that include the Panhandle, Blackland Prairies and Cross Timbers region in north and central Texas, to name a few. We circled back to Vaught with our findings. When she checked the NASS state facts, she advised, she misread a map that mapped out cattle counts by county and, Vaught said, ""neglected to break down the math step by step, and made a terribly under-informed estimate that supported my initial assumption that feedlots in North Texas concentrated cattle at rates far higher than the rest of the state."" Still, Vaught said, five counties accounting for 16.9 percent is ""still significant, given that there are 254 counties in Texas, each one reporting cattle inventory."" Our ruling Vaught wrote that only five Texas counties account for 90 percent of the state’s cattle industry. However, after checking with the USDA National Agricultural Statistics Service and looking at the most recent inventory, we found the percentage to be far lower. We rate this claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Pence dodges question but doesn’t outright 'deny’ evolution
","EDITOR'S NOTE: On July 28, 2016, PolitiFact California rated as True a statement by Democratic California Gov. Jerry Brown that Republican Indiana Gov. Mike Pence ""denies that there's such a thing as evolution."" We based that ruling on Pence’s comments in a 2009 MSNBC interview. Subsequently, our readers made some good points that led us to reconsider the fact check. They pointed out that Pence never explicitly denies evolution in the interview. Instead, Pence dodges the question multiple times. With his past skepticism of science, this gives the impression that Pence rejects evolution. Taking all of this into account, we are changing our rating to Half True and providing this new analysis. California Gov. Jerry Brown came out swinging against Republicans Donald Trump and Mike Pence in his speech at the Democratic National Convention. ""Trump says global warming is a hoax. I say Trump is a fraud,"" Brown, who has made climate change a top priority, said of the GOP presidential nominee. Last month, PolitiFact rated Mostly True a similar statement by Hillary Clinton about Trump’s ‘hoax’ claim. But did Brown stretch the truth in his attack on Pence, the Indiana governor and GOP Vice Presidential candidate? Brown said of Pence: ""... it’s not surprising that Trump chose as his running mate a man who denies that there's such a thing as evolution."" Our research Asked about Brown’s claim, his spokeswoman pointed to Pence’s 2009 interview on MSNBC’s Hardball. The interview has been widely discussed in recent weeks with Trump’s selection of Pence.  Indiana Gov. Mike Pence is first asked about evolution at the 8:00 minute mark in this video. Chris Matthews, the show’s host, asked Pence in the interview: ""Do you believe in evolution, sir?"" Pence responded: ""I embrace the view that God created the heavens and the earth and the seas and all that’s in them."" Matthews continued: ""But do you believe in evolution as the way he did it?"" Pence replied: ""The means, Chris, that he used to do that, I can’t say."" Several minutes later, Pence responded similarly to the same question: ""Chris, I believe with all my heart that God created the heavens and the earth, the seas and all that is in them. … How he did that, I’ll ask him about some day."" Pence certainly dances around the topic, but nowhere does he outright deny evolution. Pence’s comments could be interpreted as rejecting evolution, but there’s no hard evidence to back up that idea. One could also say Pence’s comments place him in the category of theistic evolutionists, or those who believe religious teachings are compatible with evolution, said Rodney Duke, a professor of religion at Appalachian State University in North Carolina. ""There are many Christians, including scientists, who will affirm that God is creator and yet accept -- or at least not deny -- that natural evolutionary means were used,"" Duke said in an email. ""Therefore, although Pence's remarks were quite circumspect and he did not affirm evolutionary means, his careful wording did not reject them."" Our research found no evidence Pence has publicly clarified his comments on evolution. Asked about Pence’s current view on the topic, his spokesman pointed to the same 2009 interview without elaborating. Evolution is not the only science-based process Pence has been circumspect about. He’s also been skeptical of climate change. And, on his campaign website in 2000, Pence challenged established health science, declaring: ""Time for a quick reality check. Despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn’t kill."" He went on to say ""In fact, 2 out of every three smokers does not die from a smoking related illness and 9 out of ten smokers do not contract lung cancer. This is not to say that smoking is good for you…"" Christian faith Pence has described himself as ""a Christian, a conservative and a Republican, in that order."" He was raised Catholic. But, as the New York Times reported in July, ""His evangelical Christianity is now the driving force behind his political agenda, whether he is working to deny federal funds to Planned Parenthood or to make it legal for religious conservatives to refuse to serve gay couples."" Though clear on some social issues, Pence has been reticent to state his specific beliefs on science. Asked, for example, whether he supports federal funding for stem cell research by Matthews in the 2009 interview, Pence responded: ""I think in our schools we should teach all of the facts about all of these controversial areas, and let our students, let our children and our children’s children decide based upon the facts and the science."" Pence takes a ‘have-it-both-ways,’ approach, declining to clarify his personal opinion on these scientific topics. But, again, that approach can’t be described as outright ‘denying’ evolution. Our ruling California Gov. Jerry Brown said GOP Vice Presidential candidate Mike Pence ""denies that there's such a thing as evolution."" Pence, in a 2009 interview on MSNBC, said: ""I embrace the view that God created the heavens and the earth and the seas and all that’s in them."" When asked again and again whether he believes in evolution, he demures, stopping short of explicitly rejecting it. He clearly did not want to answer the question, which ends up sounding like a ‘No.’ Our research found no evidence that Pence has expanded on his less-than-clear view on evolution, leaving it open to interpretation. In more recent years, the Indiana governor has criticized other science-based initiatives, including efforts to slow climate change. Brown’s statement says Pence ""denies"" evolution. The Indiana governor certainly doesn’t affirm it. That’s not the same as denying it. We rate Brown’s claim Half True.

Tim Kaine says Va. closed a background check loophole while he was governor
","Tim Kaine says he steered Virginia through some dark days as governor, but none was worse than April 16, 2007. That was the day a gunman murdered 32 students and faculty members at Virginia Tech before he took his own life. In the aftermath, Kaine says he turned his attention to Virginia’s gun laws. ""We fixed a loophole in the background record-check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer,"" Kaine told the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday while accepting his party’s nomination for vice president. Josh Schwerin, a Clinton campaign spokesman, backed Kaine’s statement by pointing to several articles about an executive order Kaine issued shortly  after the shootings. The order expanded the court records that are shared with law enforcement officials to ensure that mentally ill people who are deemed dangerous can’t buy firearms from licensed gun dealers. Federal law bars people who have been adjudicated ""mentally defective"" from purchasing firearms. But the Virginia Tech gunman, Seung-Hui Cho, cleared background checks in early 2007 to buy the two semiautomatic pistols he used in the massacre despite having been found by a judge to be a danger to himself in December 2005.   Cho was ordered to undergo outpatient care, but that record wasn’t shared with Virginia law enforcement officials, according to a state report on the shootings that was issued in 2009. As a result, Cho’s history wasn’t entered in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, and he was cleared to buy the firearms. Virginia’s laws were unclear about whether Cho’s mental health records were required to be sent to the state police so that they could be entered into national background check files. The issue centered around the fact that Cho had been ordered to undergo outpatient mental health treatment instead of being sent to an inpatient facility. While state law was clear that anyone admitted to an inpatient care facility couldn’t buy a gun, the law was ambiguous on whether someone ordered to undergo outpatient care was barred from buying a weapon, according to the 2009 state report examining the shootings. Kaine issued his executive order on April 30, 2007, two weeks after the Tech shootings. He mandated that state agencies collect information about people who are required to undergo mental health treatment ""whether on an inpatient or outpatient basis"" and send those records to state and federal databases to ensure they can’t buy a gun. Even with Kaine’s order, gaps remained. The Washington Post noted in an article that Kaine’s executive order wasn’t retroactive, meaning it only covered court orders made after its April 2007 enactment. Also, it didn’t address a loophole in state law that allows people to buy guns from unlicensed sellers without undergoing a background check. An unlicensed seller is someone who is not in the business of dealing firearms, such as a citizen seeking to sell a gun he keeps in his house. In 2008, the General Assembly passed a bill that enshrined Kaine’s executive order on mental health records into law. But Kaine failed in an effort to go one step further and close the loophole that allows private sales of guns without a background check. Our ruling Kaine said that while governor, ""We fixed a loophole in the background record check system so that we could make our commonwealth safer."" Kaine can legitimately take credit for plugging a gap in state law that allowed some mentally ill people to buy guns even after having been ordered by courts to get outpatient treatment. So we rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3CD080>],/factchecks/2016/jul/29/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-correctly-says-while-governor-state-clos/

Iran nuclear deal was Hillary Clinton's, and it 'lined the pockets' of Iran with Americans' money?
","In recent weeks, one of our most-clicked factchecks has been about an attack  Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus made on Hillary Clinton back in April 2015. Priebus, a Wisconsinite, claimed that Clinton took ""money from kings of Saudi Arabia and Morocco and Oman and Yemen."" Our rating was Half True. His phrasing could have left the impression that Clinton herself, rather than the Clinton family foundation, received the money. (And Yemen doesn’t have a monarchy and didn’t make contributions to the foundation.) On July 21, 2016, Priebus attacked Clinton again, this time during his address to the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. ""In foreign policy, a Clinton presidency means forgetting our friends and enabling our enemies,"" Priebus charged. ""Just look, just look at her disastrous Iran nuclear deal, which lined the pockets of the world’s number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money, while abandoning our greatest ally in the Middle East, the nation of Israel."" Several days earlier in Cleveland, Priebus made one statement about the Bush family appearing at GOP conventions and another about ""the facts"" and ""the best scenario for kids."" Both were rated False by PolitiFact National. This claim is not looking so good, either. Terror sponsor The Republican Party didn’t respond to our requests for information to back Priebus’ statement. But labeling Iran the ""number one state sponsor of terrorism"" isn’t just rhetoric. Iran has been on the State Department’s official list of state sponsors of terrorism since 1984. And in its latest annual country report on terrorism, released in June 2016, the State Department said Iran ""remained the foremost state sponsor of terrorism"" in 2015. But Priebus’ characterization of the nuclear deal with Iran, struck in July 2015 with the United States and several other nations, is deeply flawed. Nuclear deal The deal was aimed at making it harder for Iran to make a nuclear bomb. At the time, it was believed Iran might be two to three months away from getting a nuclear bomb. But if Iran abides by restrictions imposed by the deal, scientists say, it would take at least 12 months to build a weapon. In exchange for curbing its nuclear program, Iran gets access to tens of billions of dollars in assets (estimates are as high as $150 billion, but the exact amount is not known). But the vast majority of those assets are Iran’s own money, not American cash. Those assets had been frozen as a result of sanctions imposed on Iran by the United States and other countries. CNN noted the deal includes the State Department agreeing to pay Iran $1.7 billion to settle a 35-year-old legal dispute over a trust fund that had been frozen since Iran's revolution. So, the nuclear deal arguably ""lined the pockets"" of Iran -- but almost all of it is Iran’s own money. One more thing -- and it’s a big one -- about the timing of the deal. Clinton has said that her work as secretary of state in putting together sanctions against Iran helped usher Iran to the negotiating table, a claim PolitiFact National rated Mostly True. But Clinton was referring to work she did in 2009 and 2010. And she left the secretary position in February 2013. That means Clinton was gone for 2.5 years before the nuclear deal was struck. In other words, the heavy lifting was done under the current secretary, John Kerry, although Clinton endorsed it. And President Barack Obama had to sign off on the deal, so it belongs to him more than any secretary of state. Our rating Priebus said Clinton's Iran nuclear deal ""lined the pockets of the world's number one state sponsor of terrorism with your money."" The United States labels Iran as the top state sponsor of terrorism. But the deal was struck 2.5 years after Clinton left the Obama administration. And the vast majority of the tens of billions of dollars that Iran gets is not American money, but its own assets, which were frozen by the U.S. and other countries that imposed sanctions on Iran. For a statement that contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1E2880>],/factchecks/2016/jul/29/reince-priebus/iran-nuclear-deal-was-hillary-clintons-and-it-line/

Joaquin Castro says Donald Trump defended World War II internment camps
","U.S. Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas, used his speech on the final night of the Democratic National Convention to share the story of his grandmother, an immigrant from Mexico. His grandmother didn’t always feel welcome in the United States, he said, but she believed her sacrifices would pay off with opportunity for herself and her family — much like immigrants from other countries. ""This room is filled with many proud Americans who can tell similar stories about their own families. Great-grandchildren of Irish immigrants who came to cities like New York and Boston and saw signs that read 'No Irish Need Apply' and just worked harder,"" Castro said. ""Grandchildren of Americans who suffered in World War II internment camps — the same camps that Donald Trump has defended — and grew up to be business owners, war heroes, and public servants. Children of immigrants who have contributed to our country as doctors, police officers, and — guess what — even impartial judges."" Castro’s jab at Trump caught our attention. Did he really defend internment camps during World War II? Trump did not explicitly defend the internment camps. But he made a lot of people think along those lines by not outright condemning the World War II detention of Japanese Americans during multiple interviews. Trump has said he needed to be there to truly say. We reached out to Castro’s team for more information on that statement, but did not hear back. Trump’s campaign also did not respond by deadline. ‘Racial prejudice, wartime hysteria’ Amid fears about national security after the Dec. 7, 1941, Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued several executive orders, including Executive Order 9066. The order was to remove people of Japanese ancestry (citizens and immigrants) outside the Pacific military zone. About 120,000 people (including many who were native-born U.S. citizens) were placed in internment camps. Some were detained for up to four years in remote camps surrounded by barbed wire and armed guards. The United States did not formally apologize for the internment camps until 1988, when President Ronald Reagan signed the Civil Liberties Act, which said the World War II actions toward Japanese Americans ""were motivated largely by racial prejudice, wartime hysteria, and a failure of political leadership."" ""The experience of mass imprisonment devastated the Japanese American community,"" said Eric L. Muller, Dan K. Moore Distinguished Professor at the University of North Carolina School of Law, who has written books about Japanese Americans during World War II. ""The financial losses were vast. Families were torn apart both emotionally and physically,"" Muller said by email. ""A stigma and shame attached to the community that it took decades to shake."" Trump’s comments on internment camps Seventy-four years to the day of the Pearl Harbor attack, Trump made his first call to ban Muslims from entering the country. ""Donald J. Trump is calling for a total and complete shutdown of Muslims entering the United States until our country’s representatives can figure out what is going on,"" his statement read, citing (shaky) research that ""there is great hatred towards Americans by large segments of the Muslim population."" This idea was, and has continued to be, very controversial. Asked about the ban the next day on Good Morning America, Trump defended his proposal by comparing it to the actions of Roosevelt, ""one of the most highly respected presidents."" ""What I'm doing is no different than FDR,"" Trump said. ABC’s George Stephanopoulos asked Trump, ""I take it you are praising the setting up of internment camps for Japanese during world War II?"" Trump repeated, ""No, I’m not."" A similar back and forth occurred on MSNBC that morning when host Joe Scarborough asked Trump, ""You certainly aren't proposing internment camps, are you?"" ""I am not proposing that,"" Trump said. ""It was tough stuff, but it wasn't internment. We're not talking about the Japanese internment camps. No, not at all. But we have to get our head around a very serious problem, and it's getting worse."" Also on Dec. 8, Time magazine reported that Trump had waffled on internment camps in a recent interview. Trump told Time that he ""would have had to be there at the time"" to give a proper answer on whether he would have supported or opposed the internment of Japanese Americans. ""I certainly hate the concept of it. But I would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer,"" Trump told Time. He continued to tell the magazine that wartime sometimes requires tough decisions. A week later, the Japanese American National Museum in Los Angeles, Calif., issued a statement cautioning against provocative rhetoric deliberately provoking fear ""of any one group."" ""To cite the unlawful incarceration of Japanese Americans during World War II as an appropriate action and one that could be emulated today is to completely misunderstand that shameful chapter of history,"" the museum said. On March 27, ABC’s Jonathan Karl asked Trump if he would ""rule out"" the idea of internment camps for American Muslims, noting that Trump had not proposed internment camps. ""I would rule it out, but we would have to be very vigilant,"" Trump said. ""We're going to have to be very smart. We're going to have to be very rigid and very vigilant. And if we're not very, very strong and very, very smart, we have a big, big problem coming up."" Since announcing the Muslim ban in December, Trump has slightly shifted his position, telling the Wall Street Journal in June that instead he would temporarily suspend immigration from ""regions that have been a major source for terrorists and their supporters."" Our ruling Castro said Trump has defended World War II internment camps. Trump likened his proposed Muslim ban to how Roosevelt handled World War II. When pressed by journalists if he supported the internment camps for Japanese Americans under Roosevelt’s order, Trump said he was not praising that exactly. In another interview, Trump said he hates the ""concept"" of internment camps, but ""would have had to be there at the time to give you a proper answer"" on whether he supported or opposed Roosevelt’s action. So Trump’s comments are not as specific as Castro claims, but Trump never mounted an affirmative defense. Sometimes he declined to defend them, other times he has said he would have had to be present when the internment camps were in use.

Clinton tips hat to Bernie Sanders, but uses out of date statistic
","Hillary Clinton gave Bernie Sanders major respect as she accepted the Democratic nomination he worked so hard to claim for himself. Early in her speech, she praised Sanders for putting economic and social justice issues ""front and center, where they belong."" Clinton gave Sanders a nod again when she laid out her plans to invest in the nation’s bridges and highways, cut the cost of college tuition and make it easier for small businesses to get loans. She promised it all would be paid for. ""And here's how: Wall Street, corporations, and the super-rich are going to start paying their fair share of taxes,"" Clinton said. ""Not because we resent success. Because when more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent, that's where the money is."" Clinton’s claim about who’s been getting most of the gains comes -- almost -- straight from Sanders. On the opening night of the convention, he offered a slightly toned down version saying ""the top 1 percent in recent years has earned 85 percent of all new income."" The problem is, when we looked into that, we found that the numbers are out of date. University of California Berkeley economist Emmanuel Saez is the go-to source on income inequality. According to Saez’s latest data, the top 1 percent took in 52 percent of all income in 2015. As recently as 2012, the fraction was close to 90 percent, but here’s how things have changed since then:  When we reached out to the Clinton campaign, they cited a fact-check we wrote in 2015. But as we’ve noted, the trend has changed. Inequality still exists, but not at the level the country was seeing before. As Saez explained in his most recent report, ""In 2014 and especially in 2015, the incomes of bottom 99 percent families have finally started recovering in earnest from the losses of the Great Recession."" Our ruling Clinton said that ""more than 90 percent of the gains have gone to the top 1 percent."" That statistic was approximately correct a few years ago, but today, one of the nation’s leading authorities on income distribution says a more accurate figure is that 52 percent of all income flows to the top 1 percent. That still reveals a great deal of inequality, but not at the scale Clinton said.

Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump has called the U.S. military 'a disaster'
","National defense was one of the themes Hillary Clinton touched on when accepting the Democratic nomination for president, and she used it to criticize her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. She pledged to use United States military power to strike the terrorist group ISIS and to block online efforts to radicalize young people, promising to prevail even if ""it won't be easy or quick."" ""Now Donald Trump says, and this is a quote, 'I know more about ISIS than the generals do.' No, Donald, you don't,"" Clinton said. ""He thinks that he knows more than our military because he claimed our armed forces are 'a disaster.'"" ""Well, I've had the privilege to work closely with our troops and our veterans for many years, including as a senator on the Armed Services Committee and I know how wrong he is,"" she continued. ""Our military is a national treasure."" For this fact check, we'll see it Trump actually characterized the United States military as a disaster. When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Tim Hogan said it came during the sixth GOP primary debate, on Jan. 14, 2016. We checked the context. Trump used the line in the midst of a response to a question from Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network, who asked about South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley’s reference to Trump as one of ""the angriest voices."" Trump responded by saying, ""I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. Our healthcare is a horror show. Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry."" That assertion came at a time when other GOP candidates were expressing concern that the military had become too weak, a concern shared by some Democrats as well.. We couldn't find any other comments from Trump characterizing the military as a disaster, but he recently and repeatedly has said it is ""depleted."" For example, during a July 12 campaign rally in Indiana, Trump said, ""You know, the United States they said had never lost a war. Now we never win. We don't win on trade. We don't win with our military. Our military is so depleted. Our military has fighter jets that are in use, flown by great, great American people that are so old and they can't get parts for the fighter jets. These are people flying these jets now in combat. They can't get parts. So they go to the plane graveyards, in the deserts."" The Clinton campaign pointed to an interview from July 11, 2016, on WAVY-TV in Virginia. In the interview, Trump said, ""Right now we have a military that’s depleted and in horrible shape."" Other Democrats have picked up on the ""disaster"" statement in their attacks against Trump. We contacted several people at the Trump campaign seeking reaction. They didn't offer a response. Our ruling Clinton said Donald Trump ""claimed our armed forces are 'a disaster,’"" a comment that suggests mismanagement and incompetence. Trump did, in fact, use that characterization once during a debate in January. More recently, he has called it ""depleted"" and focused more on what he suggests is a lack of resources.

Hillary Clinton says U.S. 'put a lid on Iran's nuclear program'
","During her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton touted her experience as secretary of state, including her role in coming to a nuclear agreement with Iran. ""I'm proud that we put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot,"" she told the crowd in Philadelphia. ""Now we have to enforce it, and keep supporting Israel's security."" Since the United States has not had any military skirmishes with Iran in the past year, what she said about not firing a shot is clearly true. But what about the part about putting ""a lid on Iran’s nuclear program""? That’s a trickier question. Here, we’ll recap the fact checks we’ve done on the landmark arms-control agreement since it was struck in July 2015. In the big picture, the deal lifts international economic sanctions on Iran in exchange for the nation agreeing to curb nuclear technologies and allowing nuclear-weapons inspections for 10 to 25 years. A sticking point for critics is that while Iran has to give up 97 percent of its enriched uranium stockpile and most of its centrifuges that could enrich more, that capability is not gone entirely. Iran can have a reduced number of operating centrifuges for 10 years, but research and development on advanced centrifuges will be limited. Uranium enrichment is supposed to be kept at levels unsuitable for weapons use for the next 15 years. Iran also can no longer produce plutonium, the other element that could create a bomb.   To make sure Iran is doing what it agreed to do, international inspectors will monitor known nuclear sites for those 15 years. They also can enter an undeclared site suspected of nuclear use, although Iran could take up to 24 days to allow inspectors into such sites. There’s been plenty of debate about how verifiable such activity can be. Surveillance of centrifuge production is slated to last 20 years, and uranium mills and mines will be monitored for 25 years. Iran also has to stick to the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty that it signed in 1974, thereby no longer pursuing nuclear weapons. It must follow further international treaties, as well. Theoretically, Iran must abide by those treaties for good, even after the 25-year inspection time limit passes. Several experts have told PolitiFact that as long as Iran adheres to the terms of the agreement, it cannot build a nuclear weapon. A key mechanism of the agreement is that it lengthened Iran’s ""breakout time"" — how long it would take Iran to produce a nuclear weapon if it returned to building one. While some estimates put that time at two to three months before the deal, the breakout time is generally considered to be about a year under the terms of the deal. Iran ""does not have the uranium enrichment capacity to produce enough bomb-grade material,"" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, has told PolitiFact. ""It would take over a year. We would detect any attempt to do that within weeks, if not days."" Richard Nephew, a research scholar and program director for economic statecraft, sanctions and energy markets at Columbia University, told PolitiFact in 2015 that the deal definitely impedes Iran’s nuclear program. ""Fifteen years of restrictions and upwards of 20 years of enhanced inspections will hardly facilitate an Iranian nuclear weapon,"" he said. However, all of this is contingent on Iran abiding by the agreement in perpetuity -- something that only time will tell. Matthew Kroenig of Georgetown University, a foreign policy adviser to the 2012 Mitt Romney presidential campaign, said that once the enrichment limit is gone, that could set the stage for a nuclear weapon. Installing more and more sophisticated centrifuges ""would take at least several months,"" he said. ""It is hard to know how long this would take because Iran never came clean on its past weaponization work, and we don't know how much progress they might be able to make covertly over the next 15 years,"" he said. ""But again, several months is a reasonable assumption."" Next, it would need to marry the warhead to its ballistic missiles, but given its experience in mounting conventional warheads on its already sizable ballistic missile stockpile, this should be a relatively routine matter, Kroenig said. ""So, in sum, after the limits expire, it would likely still take Iran between several months and a year or so to have an actual deliverable nuclear weapon,"" he said. And ""to build an arsenal of nuclear weapons, it would take several years."" Our ruling Clinton said, ""We put a lid on Iran's nuclear program without firing a single shot."" There are lots of uncertainties about how well the accord will hold up over time, and especially what will happen once some of its provisions expire. As the saying goes, there are no guarantees in life. Still, most independent experts we have checked with agreed that the deal is both effective on paper and close to the best outcome the United States could have achieved through diplomatic means. So we’re giving it some benefit of the doubt. As long as you define ""put a lid on"" as ""keep in check"" -- a definition we think is reasonable -- rather than ""ensure something will never, ever happen,"" then Clinton has a plausible case. We rate her statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/36d26cd0-52c4-49c6-a2a5-cd7e0d61b130",[<zip object at 0x00000280979D8AC0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-us-put-lid-irans-nuclear-prog/

Hillary Clinton's Half True claim on job recovery during Obama's tenure
","During her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention, Hillary Clinton praised President Barack Obama’s efforts to steer the nation’s recovery from the Great Recession. ""Now, I don't think President Obama and Vice President Biden get the credit they deserve for saving us from the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes,"" she told the crowd in Philadelphia. ""Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs. Twenty million more Americans with health insurance. And an auto industry that just had its best year ever. Now, that's real progress, but none of us can be satisfied with the status quo. Not by a long shot."" Here we’ll look at the employment claim -- ""nearly 15 million new jobs."" Is that correct? Actually, to get that number, Clinton fuzzes the time frame. To do it, she picked the low point of the job market under Obama. From that point, the United States has gained nearly 15 million private-sector jobs. Specifically, the number of employed Americans bottomed out in February 2010 with 107.3 million jobs and rebounded, as of June 2016, to just over 122 million jobs. That’s an increase of about 14.8 million jobs -- a reasonable approximation for Clinton’s phrasing of ""nearly 15 million."" But note the time frame for that calculation. It doesn’t start at the point ""when they"" -- Obama and Biden -- ""took office."" February 2010 was just over a year after Obama and Biden were sworn in. Essentially, Obama and Biden took office as the recession was spiraling to its low point, but it took a while to hit bottom. So after they were sworn in, the number of jobs continued to fall for a year as they worked to stop the economic freefall. We should note that starting the count in February 2010 is something economists have told us is actually a reasonable decision, since the recession began under George W. Bush and Obama can’t reasonably be blamed for job losses in the earliest part of his tenure, when the die was already cast. However, Clinton glossed over the difference in the time frame by starting the count at their inauguration. And how big a difference does this make? It’s not trivial. Using this measurement, the number of jobs rose from about 111.5 million in January 2009 to 122.1 million in June 2016. That’s an increase of 10.6 million jobs, or only about two-thirds of the nearly 15 million total Clinton touted in her speech. We should also note that Clinton chose to use private-sector jobs as the benchmark. That boosts the numbers a bit compared to total jobs because widespread budget-cutting in states and localities has led to a smaller government workforce. If she had cited total employment gains rather than private-sector gains, the increases would have been a little lower -- an increase of 10.1 million jobs (from the start of Obama’s term) or 14.4 million jobs (from the low point in February 2010). Finally, we’ll note, as we regularly do, that no elected official deserves full credit (or blame) for economic results on their watch. Policies pursued by a president can help the economy, but other factors beyond the reach of a president -- from technological change to improvements in the global economy -- also play a role. Our ruling Clinton said, ""Our economy is so much stronger than when they took office. Nearly 15 million new private-sector jobs."" Clinton specified ""when they took office"" in her speech, and the actual number of jobs starting with their inauguration is only about two-thirds as big -- 10.6 million jobs. The 15 million number uses a different, more limited timeframe to count job creation. The statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context, so we rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/b765565f-195e-4f51-959a-9193fbebf204",[<zip object at 0x00000280978B56C0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/29/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-half-true-claim-about-job-recovery/

Clinton: Deaths of Dallas police drew nearly 500 job applicants

""Chief David Brown asked the community to support his force, maybe even join them,"" Clinton said. ""And you know how the community responded? Nearly 500 people applied in just 12 days."" Clinton has it right. On July 7 in Dallas, as a peaceful protest wrapped up in the evening, an Army veteran systematically opened fire on white police officers.

'Drug Addict' TV ad says U.S. borrows 41 cents on the dollar
","
Imagine America as a sweaty, scruffy, cigarette-smoking dude -- with a drug problem.

That vision comes to life in a new political ad: 
""America could learn a lot from a drug addict,"" says Addicted Dude. ""Even though this country’s $14  trillion in debt, Washington raised the debt ceiling 10 times in the last 10 years. Each time – it’s like another hit – another spending hit. But you’re the junkies.

""41 cents out of every dollar you spend is borrowed from places like China. So China is like your dealer, and your addiction and your dealer control your life. To borrow less, you need to spend less. Yeah … Washington could learn a lot from a drug addict.""

The ad was paid for by the Public Notice Research & Education Fund, a sister organization to Public Notice. In a press release, Public Notice said it was airing the ads in hopes that the ""super committee"" in Congress working on a new budget would adopt more spending cuts.

Public Notice says its mission is ""to increase the public’s awareness and understanding of the economic issues that affect their daily lives, communities, and children and grandchildren."" That sounded rather generic to us, and we wanted to know more about Public Notice. However, as a 501(c)(4), Public Notice is not required to disclose its donors. Public Notice’s executive director, Gretchen Hamel, is a former spokesman for the  House Republican Conference.

We decided to fact-check the ad’s claim that ""41 cents out of every dollar you spend is borrowed from places like China.""

To check this item, we turned to two government agencies that monitor the economy.

We consulted the most recent report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to see if 41 cents of every dollar is borrowed.

The numbers show that for fiscal year 2011 (which ended Sept. 30, 2011), the federal government took in $2.3 trillion and spent $3.6 trillion. So the shortfall between receipts and outlays was about $1.3 trillion. That means about 36 cents of every dollar spent was borrowed.

That’s pretty close to the 41 percent the ad cited. When we contacted Public Notice, they told us they took their numbers from an earlier report published in June 2011 that included numbers for fiscal year 2010. The numbers we used were for fiscal year 2011 and published Nov. 7, 2011.

Next, for the sake of thoroughness, we checked how much U.S. debt is held by China. China is the number one foreign country holding U.S. debt, according to the U.S. Treasury Department.

China holds $1.15 trillion in U.S. debt, followed by Japan with $957 billion; the United Kingdom with $422 billion; and a group of oil-exporting countries that collectively hold $230 billion. (See the entire list.)

So is Addicted Dude a good analogy for our budget situation? If China is our drug dealer, China’s offering us the good stuff at an extremely low mark-up -- interest rates on U.S. Treasuries are near rock-bottom right now. On the other hand ... that’s how they get you hooked.

So we’ll leave it up to you to decide whether the metaphor is apt.

The ad from Public Notice says, ""41 cents out of every dollar you spend is borrowed from places like China."" China is indeed the country that holds the most U.S. debt. But the most recent numbers on U.S. debt put the borrowed amount slightly lower, at 36 cents on the dollar. So we rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A408D80>],/factchecks/2011/nov/16/public-notice/drug-addict-tv-ad-says-us-borrows-41-cents-dollar/

Rick Scott says U.S. regulations are among the most difficult in the world
","
Republican Gov. Rick Scott repeated a familiar politician's mantra when he bashed ""overregulation.""

In a Nov. 14, 2011, press release, Scott criticized President Barack Obama for accusing America of being ""lazy"" in attracting investment:  
""Obstacles to job creation in America are a result of policy, not of motivation,"" Scott said. ""Our business taxes are among the highest in the world. Our regulations are among the most difficult in the world. If you need evidence, look no further than the companies who have moved their oil rigs from the Gulf coast to foreign countries in the last year because of the regulatory environment. Just last week, yet another major medical device manufacturer announced they were cutting more than 1,000 jobs because of new Obamacare taxes. 

""The president's comments indicate a belief that more taxes, more regulation and more government is the solution, yet those are the very things standing in the way of those of us who are trying – very energetically – to recruit businesses and jobs to our states.""

Scott made a few strongly-worded claims in that statement, but for this Truth-O-Meter we will explore whether ""our regulations are among the most difficult in the world.""

Scott has portrayed himself as a slayer of regulations. He promised to freeze all regulations in Florida during his 2010 campaign.

We went in search of data about the U.S. and overregulation. We found several measures that contradicted Scott's statement:  
• The World Bank publishes an annual ""Doing Business"" ranking that examines the business climate in 183 countries. In its most recent report, released in October 2011, it gave the U.S. an overall ranking of fourth, behind Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand. The U.S. scored particularly high compared to other countries in getting credit (4), protecting investors (5) and starting a business (13). 

• The conservative Heritage Foundation, together with the Wall Street Journal, publishes an annual ""Index of Economic Freedom,"" which in 2011 placed the U.S. 9th out of 179 countries with a score of 77.8 out of 100. This index looks at several factors including government spending, property rights and business freedom. On business freedom -- on which the U.S. scored 91 -- Heritage wrote, ""The overall freedom to create and run a private enterprise, regulated primarily at the state level, is strongly protected. However, new regulatory uncertainty hampers business expansion and employment creation."" Heritage's index relies heavily on the World Bank's report.

• The libertarian Cato Institute publishes an ""Economic Freedom of the World"" report that stated that ranked the U.S. 10th among 141 countries in 2009. ""The world's largest economy, the United States, has suffered one of the largest declines in economic freedom over the last 10 years, pushing it into tenth place. Much of this decline is a result of higher government spending and borrowing and lower scores for the legal structure and property rights components,"" the report said.

The report shows that ""the U.S. is still more free by comparison to much of the world,"" said Ian Vásquez, director of the Cato Institute's Center for Global Liberty and Prosperity, in an e-mail to PolitiFact. ""But that measure only captures regulations that can be compared across countries and misses a lot. There is no good global index on this issue. Bottom line, the statement is probably true about some regulations, but not overall in the world.""

What experts told us

We sent Scott's claim -- and the examples he cited about oil rigs moving overseas and job cuts at a medical manufacturer -- to several experts. (Scott's press release didn't identify the medical manufacturer.) None of them fully defended Scott's statement that the United States' regulations are among the most difficult in the world. Several referred us to the World Bank report we mentioned above, while others warned that comparing regulations among countries can be difficult. 

The U.S.'s ranking ""is a far cry from 'most difficult,"" wrote Lawrence J. White of New York University in an e-mail, pointing to the World Bank ratings.

James Gattuso of the Heritage Foundation said that the trends in the World Bank report are mixed for the U.S. and pointed to an Oct. 28 Wall Street Journal report (subscription required to view full article) that said that although the U.S. is ranked fourth, it has dropped in some categories in recent years including on paying taxes and ease of registering property. And the cost of starting a business measured as a percentage of per capita income as well as the cost to import have increased. 

Paul Portney, an economics professor at the University of Arizona, was chief economist for the White House Council on Environmental Quality in 1979-80 under President Jimmy Carter. He sent us an answer as it pertains to environmental regulations, which is relevant here because half of Scott's evidence cited in his press release related to oil rigs moving from the Gulf to foreign countries due to regulation.

""The U.S., like many of the world's developed countries, does have stringent environmental regulations. Ours are in general about as stringent as those in Europe and Japan, though I'd say that Europe's are now tougher than ours. In some respects, though, we go beyond what other countries do (an example is the regulation of auto emissions, though that is more the doing of the State of California than federal standards). Compared to China, India, Russia and Brazil--the rapidly developing countries of the world--our standards are much tougher, and that has no doubt played some role in the relocation of industry to those places. However, you have to remember that there are benefits that accompany the higher costs of regulation in the U.S. My guess is that few Floridians would be willing to tolerate Beijing, Mumbai, Moscow or Rio de Janeiro air quality, to take but one example. ... I'd say that there are other, more important factors that affect business location than regulatory burdens, even while acknowledging that we can and must streamline our regulatory process.""

Gov. Scott responds

Scott spokesman Brian Burgess e-mailed us a response.

""I hope you aren’t missing the forest for the trees…but the phrase you have chosen to zero in on is rather vague, not really quantifiable, and simply refers to the difficult long-term outlook that American job creators are facing.""

Burgess directed us to the Florida chamber's small business survey which stated ""The top issues facing Florida’s small businesses continue to include government regulations, access to capital, healthcare, taxes.""

Burgess also stated in an e-mail that federal regulations have been on the rise in recent years and that thousands more are in the works -- but that wasn't what Scott said.

As for the World Bank study, Burgess wrote that the World Bank study notes that it is limited in scope and quoted from the preface: ""It does not attempt to measure all costs and beneﬁts of a particular law or regulation to society as a whole. Nor does it measure all aspects of the business environment that matter to ﬁrms and investors or affect the competitiveness of an economy.""

Burgess concluded: ""In short, the governor’s comment is based on his own experience in international business, his conversations with other business owners, entrepreneurs and other job creators in Florida and throughout the world, and the hard data that shows that the U.S. regulatory environment has grown progressively worse in recent years and is projected to continue down that path – an outlook that makes the United States regulatory environment among the most difficult in the world. The statement was worded carefully because the subject matter is difficult to quantify. Even World Bank admits as much."" 
Our ruling 
Scott said ""our regulations are among the most difficult in the world."" As his evidence, he cites companies moving their oil rigs from the Gulf Coast overseas and a medical device manufacturer cutting more than 1,000 jobs ""because of new Obamacare taxes."" Even if some companies move overseas or cut jobs and attribute those actions to overregulation, that doesn't mean that regulations in the U.S. are among the most difficult in the world. The reports we found ranked the U.S. between 4th and 10th for business climate. Scott, along with other political or business leaders, certainly can point to concerns about the number, cost or impact of regulations. But Scott hasn't proven that our country's regulations are among the most difficult in the world. In fact, the evidence we found points in the opposite direction. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0AA1C0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/16/rick-scott/rick-scott-us-regulations-are-most-difficult-world/

Rhode Island corrections union president David Mellon says correctional officers' life expectancy is 58 years
","
Life expectancy has been a key element in the pension overhaul debate playing out in Rhode Island, in part because retirees are living longer, requiring more money to fund their retirements.

Public safety workers -- police, firefighters and correctional officers -- have been characterized as an exception.

For example, in July we examined a claim that law enforcement officers die 10 years earlier than the general population. We found it to be False because studies showed that they lived nearly as long, or perhaps a bit longer, than other public employees.

During an Oct. 27, 2011, General Assembly hearing on pension reform, David Mellon, president of the Rhode Island Brotherhood of Correctional Officers, made a similar claim.

""The job lowers your life expectancy,"" he said, adding later that ""Metropolitan did a study in, I believe it was 1998, and the life expectancy was 58 from that study.""

A lower life expectancy seems plausible, but age 58 seemed extraordinarily low when a 35-year-old male is predicted to live to age 77. We decided to track down the truth.

It turned out to be as easy as handcuffing a ghost.

We called Metropolitan Life to ask about the table. They couldn't find it and suggested we contact the Society of Actuaries. But the society doesn't keep that kind of data on life expectancies for various professions.

A Google search uncovered other cases in which people made the same assertion, but they also offered no documentation. For example, William Hepner of the New Jersey Department of Corrections, during testimony before the Commission on Safety and Abuse in America's Prisons in 2005, said he was citing Metropolitan Life Actuary Statistics from 1998. Corrections spokeswoman Deirdre Fedkenheuer said Hepner was retired and not reachable.

We found a similar pattern when we followed a separate thread -- a comparable claim that correctional officers typically died at age 59. Articles and websites would incorrectly credit another author or website with doing the research to back up the claim.

The source appears to be an unnamed report, supposedly written in 1982 or earlier, from a union we couldn't find:  New York State Council 80 of the American Federal of State, County and Municipal Employees. (Council 82 currently represents correctional officers in New York, but that union couldn't find a copy of the report.)

We also contacted the National Institute of Corrections, part of the Federal Bureau of Prisons, and the American Correctional Association. They had no definitive data either.

At this point, Mellon's statement appears to be an urban legend -- a plausible but unfounded ""fact"" that is repeated so often it comes to be regarded as gospel.

""That's exactly what we found,"" said Joshua Stengel, program manager for NIC's information center, who tried unsuccessfully to track down the source of the statistic in June 2010. ""My concern was that it was being cited by somebody like a union as a bargaining chip. And if they created it, they were essentially citing themselves.""

Stengel and Council 82 subsequently directed us to an Oct. 17, 2011, Florida report -- published on a police union website and done by Brevard County Sheriff J.R. ""Jack"" Parker -- that concludes that law enforcement and correctional officers typically die at age 62.5, 12 years earlier than all Florida residents. Parker used the report to argue for a rollback of the minimum age and length of service requirements for the pension benefits of law enforcement and correctional officers.

The most obvious flaw in the report is that it compared the average age of death in those male-dominated professions to the age of death among both men AND women in Florida, failing to take into account the fact that women outnumber men in the Sunshine State and tend to live six years longer.

And while Parker's report also claims that scientific studies show that law enforcement officers have shorter life spans than the general public, some of the evidence cited in his report shows the opposite, as we found in our earlier PolitiFact analysis.

The truth may be far less ominous.

In 1993, the Correctional Service of Canada released an analysis of 148,850 active and retired public service workers, 1,422 of whom were retired correctional officers. The analysis, by Daniel J.K. Beavon and Paul S. Maxim, modified in 2009, found that male officers had an average life expectancy of 77.5 years.

That's just a year less than the longevity for all male Canadian public service employees and at least two years longer than the overall life expectancy of Canadian males.

After adjusting for factors such as starting age of employment, age of retirement, length of service, class and reason for retirement, the researchers concluded that the longevity difference was not statistically significant.

When we asked Mellon about his original statement, he said it made sense because ""We don't have a lot of old correctional officer retirees."" Of the 177 former correctional officers collecting retirement benefits, ""we have nobody collecting in their 80s,"" 22 are in their 70s and 97 are in their 60s.

That means that two-thirds of the retirees are 60 or older, but those numbers only reflect who is living. The issue is the age at which they die.

""Over the years, unfortunately, I have been to many funerals of correctional officers under 55 and many retirees under 60. I think the numbers speak for themselves,"" he said.

Our Ruling

David Mellon testified that the life expectancy for correctional officers is 58, and he said he got the information from Metropolitan Life.

But he did not actually get that statistic from the insurance company. He was citing an often-quoted number that, as far as we could tell after nearly two weeks of looking for its source, has no real documentation to back it up. A similar claim still making the rounds is actually 30 years old and comes from a questionable source. The most recent report we could find, from Florida, failed to make even the most basic adjustment -- for gender -- that would make it a valid study.

And the only thorough analysis we could find concluded that male correctional officers actually live longer than the general population.

We don't doubt that working as a correctional officer is hazardous and stressful, and we can understand how the funerals Mellon is attending could give him the impression that his coworkers are dying prematurely.

But the hard evidence cited to back up such claims turns out to be unreliable, ethereal or contradicts his testimony.

We rule Mellon's statement False.

Debbie Wasserman Schultz says Obama has created ""millions"" of manufacturing jobs
","
Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla, and chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee touted President Barack Obama’s record on the economy in an interview on the Nov. 13, 2011, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press,

The host, David Gregory, asked Wasserman Schultz whether she would concede that Americans aren’t any better off after nearly three years of Obama’s policies.

""Well, what I concede is that we do have a long way to go,"" she said. ""But we absolutely have begun to turn things around, and we have made steady, but not quick enough, progress. I mean, before President Obama took office, we were losing 750,000 jobs a month, David. And now we've had 20 straight months of growth in the private sector. We've added 2.8 million jobs in the private sector alone. We've begun to add millions of jobs in manufacturing. We're starting to focus on making things in America again.""

Let’s take her points one by one:

 ""Before President Obama took office, we were losing 750,000 jobs a month.""

Strictly speaking, in November and December 2008 -- that is, the final full months before Obama took office -- the nation lost 802,000 and 619,000 jobs respectively. If you throw in January 2009, the month Obama took office, the nation lost 820,000 jobs. Rounding that off to 750,000 jobs per month seems in the ballpark.

 ""We've had 20 straight months of growth in the private sector.""

Given the context from the rest of the quote, we’re assuming that Wasserman Schultz meant job growth. By that metric, she’s right.

""We've added 2.8 million jobs in the private sector.""

If you start counting at the low point of the past few years -- February 2010 -- she’s right. Since that time, the number of private-sector jobs has risen by 2.77 million, or 2.8 million if you round up. (Over the same period, the number of government jobs has shrunk, weakening the overall jobs picture.)

But using other date ranges will produce lower -- even negative -- totals. Since the Obama presidency began in January 2009, the number of private-sector jobs has actually decreased by more than 1.4 million. Reasonable people can disagree about where the best starting point is for measuring a new president’s impact on the economy, but Wasserman Schultz’s number is the most positive one you can come up with.

 We’ve added ""millions of jobs in manufacturing.""

This is the one claim where Wasserman Schultz is far, far off. The lowest point for manufacturing jobs was December 2009, almost a year into the Obama administration. Since then, the number of manufacturing jobs has rebounded, increasing by 303,000. That’s nothing to sneeze at -- but it’s far from even a million, much less the ""millions"" Wasserman Schultz claims.

And if you look at the numbers since the day Obama took office, manufacturing jobs have actually fallen by 800,000.

A final point: When we rate statements that seek to assign credit or blame to a politician, we also look at whether the politician in question was really responsible. As we’ve written before, presidents do have a role in job creation, but there are many other factors at play as well, so we don’t think it’s fair for Wasserman Schultz to give Obama all the credit for the gains she cited. (Just as it would be unfair to give him all the blame for losses.)

Our ruling

On Wasserman Schultz’s first two points, we have no major quibbles. On the third, the number is accurate according to one calculation, but it is cherry picked in a way that sheds the most favorable light on the president. And on the fourth -- manufacturing jobs -- Wasserman is flat-out wrong. We realize that she said ""we've begun to add millions of jobs,"" suggesting more to come. But a rebound of 303,000 jobs is too few to support a claim that big. Meanwhile, we’re downgrading her for overselling Obama’s role in job creation. On balance, we rate her statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967B3800>],/factchecks/2011/nov/15/debbie-wasserman-schultz/debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-obama-has-created-mi/

Rick Perry says federal bureaucrats will take over local building codes
","
Texas Gov. Rick Perry didn’t refer to U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen by name when he attacked the New Hampshire Democrat last month over her proposed energy efficiency bill. But, with a conservative audience before him, he didn’t have to.

""Instead of relieving the economic burden … you have your counterpart in the United States Senate who is working on a bill that would make things worse for home builders,"" Perry said to great applause at the Cornerstone Action Dinner, October 28, 2011 in Manchester, N.H.

""Under her scheme, federal bureaucrats could take over the local building code enforcement in your city if so-called green mandates are not complied with quickly enough,"" Perry said. ""It is just simply bureaucratic overkill.""

Just as Perry didn’t mention Shaheen by name, he didn’t identify the specific legislation he was referring to. But a call to the Perry campaign found the governor was referring to the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act of 2011.

The bill, introduced in May by co-sponsors Shaheen and Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, proposes a host of changes to national energy policies and practices. If passed, it would launch a federal training program for energy-efficient building design and operation, and it would establish a loan program for energy improvements to homes and small businesses, among other initiatives.

But would it really hand control of local building codes over to the federal government? We’re on the case.

Under the proposal, which reinforces existing law, the federal Department of Energy would work with building industry groups, such as the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers, to develop new model standards for residential and commercial buildings.

The new standards would adjust federal targets toward more efficient appliances, lighting, windows and insulation, according to the text of the bill, S. 1000. And states would have two years from the date the new codes are implemented to report whether they plan to adopt the standards or not.

""The 1992 Energy Policy Act mandated that states must review and consider adopting each revision of national model energy codes. S.1000 does not change this,"" Jeff Sadosky, a spokesman for Sen. Portman, the bill co-sponsor, wrote in an e-mail statement.

""What it does is require the federal government to more frequently and consistently revise the national codes,"" Sadosky wrote. ""There remains no federal mandate on states to adopt national model energy codes.

Those states that do agree to the standards would be subject to a certification process, in which planners demonstrate their building codes meet the federal models or they are working towards them. But, according to the bill text and policy analysts alike, the legislation would not require any states to take part, nor would it offer provisions for any penalties for non-compliance.

""Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, any model building code or standard established under this section shall not be binding on a State, local government or Indian tribe as a matter of Federal law,"" the legislation reads.

""The voluntary building codes provision contained in Senator Shaheen’s bipartisan energy efficiency bill provides models, not mandates, for the states,"" Shaheen spokeswoman Faryl Ury added this week in a written statement.

""Adoption and enforcement is reserved for the states,"" she wrote.

Financial incentives would be available to states that opt to participate. The bill, which passed the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in July 2011, proposes up to $200 million in incentives to be spread among participating states, among other training and educational resources.

But, without any federal mandates, the only thing states stand to lose is access to the incentive money.

The bill is awaiting a full Senate vote.

""Basically, there’s a lot of carrot with no stick,"" said Deborah Estes, senior counsel for the Senate energy committee, which is chaired by Sen. Jeff Bingaman, a New Mexico Democrat.

""We hope that states do the right thing and participate in this. It’s for the good of their citizens and for the good of the nation,"" Estes said. ""But a lot of states, particularly smaller states, might not have the resident expertise to do this.""

Our ruling:

Under Shaheen’s energy legislation, states would be required to report whether they plan to meet the model building codes. Those states that agree to the standards and accept federal dollars would be subject to a certification process to ensure they meet the regulations. But there is nothing in the bill that requires states to take part, nor are there any penalties for non-compliance. The bill is voluntary, not mandatory. We rate Perry’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972A9140>],/factchecks/2011/nov/15/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-federal-bureaucrats-will-take-over/

Solyndra ad claims President Barack Obama gave taxpayer money to help his campaign donors at failed solar company
","
A new TV ad airing in Florida and other states portrays President Barack Obama as a politician who showered millions of taxpayer dollars on ""his friends at Solyndra,"" a once-hot solar company now in bankruptcy court.

Americans for Prosperity, a group that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad, which uses news clips and e-mail snippets to support an ominous voiceover:

""Wealthy donors with ties to Solyndra give Obama hundreds of thousands of dollars.

""What does Obama give them in return? Half a billion in taxpayer money to help his friends at Solyndra, a business the White House knew was on the path to bankruptcy. But loaned them the money anyway.

""And when the government found out that Solyndra couldn't make its payments, the administration changed the terms of the loan to let Solyndra continue taking taxpayer money.

""Now, Solyndra's bankrupt, and taxpayers are stuck with the bill. What's worse? The Obama administration has just approved another billion dollars in loans to solar companies who also donated money to Democrats.

""Risking billions of taxpayer dollars to help his political donors — is this the change we're supposed to believe in?""

We decided to fact-check the ad, focusing on whether the president gave ""half a billion in taxpayer money to help his friends at Solyndra, a business the White House knew was on the path to bankruptcy.""

Rise and fall of a solar panel company

Solyndra, based in Silicon Valley, formed in 2005 with a blockbuster idea: a unique type of solar cell, cylinders that didn't require pricey silicon, which promised to make them cheaper than their rivals. 

In 2006, the U.S. Department of Energy invited the company to apply for a new loan guarantee program, a program created with the support of a majority of Republicans, who controlled Congress at the time. 

The company's December 2006 pre-application was enough to vault it into a group of 16 applicants invited to submit full applications in 2007. By early January 2009, Solyndra's file had been reviewed by the department's credit committee and returned with a request for further analysis. On Jan. 15, the loan program office said ""due diligence"" for the Solyndra loan was scheduled to be complete by March 2009. The money was going to build a gleaming new factory in Fremont, Calif.

Obama took office Jan. 20, 2009, and one of his first legislative achievements was a major economic stimulus package. The administration pushed to finish the $535 million loan for Solyndra so it could tout the company as a poster child of the stimulus — construction jobs plus a boost to American green energy. Solyndra got the loan Sept. 3, 2009. 

As recently as 2010, the company was hailed as a Silicon Valley superstar, ranked a top clean-tech company by the Wall Street Journal and one of the ""World's 50 Most Innovative Companies"" by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology magazine.

But subsidized Chinese solar panels got even cheaper as the price of silicon plummeted — along with Solyndra's chances for becoming profitable. Red flags multiplied by February 2011, and the government restructured the loan to rescue the factory project.

Still, Solyndra collapsed spectacularly in August 2011. Factory employees who worked late the night before, as they often did, found their jobs had evaporated the following morning — with no notice and no severance. An FBI raid followed. Solyndra filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection on Sept. 6, 2011. 

Solyndra had fallen far and fast. Its unique solar cells had once attracted more than $1 billion from private investors. Now taxpayers could lose hundreds of millions of dollars.

Friends of Barack?

The Americans for Prosperity ad says Obama helped ""his friends at Solyndra."" So, who owns Solyndra?

Four venture capital firms own nearly 70 percent of the company, according to bankruptcy filings. Argonaut Ventures owns the largest stake, with nearly 40 percent, while Madrone Partners own 13 percent. Two others own about 9 percent and 7 percent. 

Who was the ad talking about? The ad's fine print refers to a Daily Caller article headlined ""Bankrupt solar company with fed backing has cozy ties to Obama admin."" 

The story focused on ""shareholders and executives"" of Solyndra who ""fundraised for and donated to the Obama administration to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars."" The largest contributor listed in the story: George Kaiser, who raised $50,000 to $100,000 for Obama's campaign. (For a little context, in the big-money world of presidential fundraising, he's among 560 elite fundraisers for Obama, though not in the top tier who gathered upwards of half a million each.)

Kaiser, though, is neither a shareholder nor an executive of Solyndra. The Tulsa, Okla., oil billionaire is the donor behind the George Kaiser Family Foundation. The foundation focuses on poverty, community health, civic enhancement — and national energy policy. (Its National Energy Policy Institute is ""an effort to establish a rational energy policy that will effectively reduce U.S. dependence on foreign oil."") The foundation, rather than hire an outside financial adviser to handle its investments, does it mostly in-house, through a subsidiary. That subsidiary is Argonaut Ventures, the largest investor in Solyndra. 

Kaiser isn't on the foundation's board or Argonaut's or Solyndra's. (And for the record, his foundation is unrelated to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, which focuses on the health care system and national health care reform.)

It's important to note here that Kaiser was never in a position to profit from Solyndra — his contributions to his foundation are ""irretractable.""

""He could not withdraw money from the foundation for his private use,"" said C. Renzi Stone, a spokesman for the foundation. ""So that money is there forever. ... The investment in Solyndra would not have benefited Mr. Kaiser personally in any way.""

A handful of other executives affiliated with Solyndra's management and board donated to the Obama campaign or other Democrats over the years, according to the Daily Caller story. But others didn't reach the level of Kaiser's fundraising — which Stone said could be traced to a single fundraiser at Kaiser's Tulsa home in 2007. 

Meanwhile, Madrone Partners, which owns more than 10 percent of Solyndra, is an investment vehicle for another family — the Waltons of Walmart fame. While some argue that Walmart is no longer a conservative company that focuses solely on GOP causes, a search of Federal Election Commission records for contributions from people who list Madrone as an employer still shows most cash benefited GOP recipients. General partner Gregory Penner, for example, a Walton in-law, gave primarily to Republicans, such as $5,000 to the Senate Conservatives Fund, $10,000 to the Republican Party of Kentucky and $10,000 to McCain Victory 2008. He also made smaller contributions to a handful of Democrats such as U.S. Sen. Ben Nelson of Nebraska.

House Republicans investigate

The Republican-controlled House Energy and Commerce Committee has been investigating since February 2011 how close ties may have been between Solyndra and the Obama administration. Its Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee held hearings in July, September and October, and has been collecting documents and correspondence, including from the White House.

So far, the subcommittee's work has generated more than 85,000 pages of documents, according to the White House.  
The committee members have pointed to e-mails that show the Obama administration was eager to confirm Solyndra's loan so the president and vice president could tout it as a stimulus success story. ""Can you confirm whether there are any issues regarding a closing on Sept. 3 for a Sept. 4 VP event on Solyndra? This implies we will need to wrap up our review/approval by Sept. 1,"" said one Energy Department e-mail from late August.

Other e-mail shows that Steve Mitchell, Argonaut's managing director who also served on Solyndra's board, and Ken Levit, the executive director of the George Kaiser Family Foundation, exchanged messages with George Kaiser about Solyndra and the White House.

Kaiser visited Obama's White House at least 16 times to chat about energy policy, according to the Daily Caller and Tulsa World, but the foundation told reporters that Solyndra's loan never came up. 

Spokesman Stone repeated in November: ""To reaffirm our previous public statements, George Kaiser had no discussions with the government regarding the loan to Solyndra.""

But messages released by House Republicans on Nov. 9, 2011 include this one from Kaiser to Mitchell, copied to Levit:

""A couple of weeks ago when Ken and I were visited with a group of administration folks in D.C. who are in charge of the stimulus process (White House, not DOE) and Solyndra came up, every one of them responded simultaneously about their thorough knowledge of the Solyndra story, suggesting it was one of their prime poster children,"" Kaiser wrote in March 2010.

Did they talk about the loan? It's not clear.

Meanwhile, in the same batch of e-mails, they discuss that they don't expect to leverage their White House relationships for special treatment.  Mitchell noted to Kaiser and Levit, ""I think the company is hoping that we have some unnatural relationship that can open bigger doors — I've cautioned them that no one really has those relationships anymore.""

The path to bankruptcy

So did the administration know Solyndra was ""on the path to bankruptcy""? 

The ad suggests that the Energy Department thought Solyndra would run short on cash as it built its new factory but approved the loan anyway, pointing to e-mail messages released by the House subcommittee. Those messages, written in August 2009 as the department was drafting the final loan terms, got into details about the project's ""cash balance"" and ""working capital requirements."" The loan guarantee was formally issued on Sept. 3, 2009.

House Democrats responded to this idea in September, saying that ""a career agency official who served in the Bush administration"" had responded to the concern raised on those messages. That official's e-mail, also from August, said that equity investors, who had already pumped over $1 billion into the company, wouldn't let a short-term cash crunch keep Solyndra from finishing its project.

And in fact when Solyndra later restructured its Energy Department loan, private investors did throw in $75 million to keep the company on track. (Of course, that's the subject of its own uproar: The terms of the deal put that $75 million loan ahead of taxpayers' investment. House Republicans say that was illegal; Energy Department lawyers had cleared it at the time.)

The idea of the loan guarantee program was to push technology from research and development into commercial production — an inherently risky process. Energy Department officials questioned whether Solyndra had the cash to complete its factory project but concluded private investors would continue to bankroll the company. That's rather different from the ad's claim of political favoritism.

The sky-high price of high-grade silicon, one of the keys to marketing Solyndra's silicon-free design, dove from almost $1,000 a pound in early 2008 to less than $100 a pound a year later, according to the Los Angeles Times. That left its technology much more expensive than competing flat panels, and paved the way for its struggle to survive. Solyndra argued, the Times reported, that it just needed time to get its prices down. But it never did catch up. 

Autumn Hanna of Taxpayers for Common Sense has been highly critical of the loan guarantee program since it started in 2005. She noted the program — backed by both Republicans and Democrats over the years — had ""too few protections for taxpayers and too little rules governing the decision making."" (The Government Accountability Office raised similar concerns in 2008 and 2010.)

""This was a recipe for fiscal disaster, and Solyndra will likely be just the tip of the iceberg,"" she said.

Our ruling

Solyndra's story is unfinished. FBI and congressional investigations continue, and more information about the loan guarantee program may yet come to light. 

The TV ad says ""(President Barack Obama gave) half a billion in taxpayer money to help his friends at Solyndra, a business the White House knew was on the path to bankruptcy."" Some of this is correct, while some isn't supported by the existing evidence.

First, the money wasn't Obama's to give. Solyndra's request predated his administration, and career Energy Department officials handled the deal.

Second, e-mails so far don't show an administration pushing through a loan to help Obama's ""friends at Solyndra."" Rather, it appears the administration asked the Energy Department officials to hurry the regular process, so the administration could burnish its stimulus efforts. 

Third, while e-mails raised doubts about Solyndra's liquidity as the Energy Department finalized the loan, those questions were answered by an official who argued investors would step in to protect the project — red flags, yes. But awareness in the White House the company would dissolve? No.

The government wasn't the only blindsided investor — private investors put up far more, and stand to lose more, than taxpayers. 
The Solyndra story might be one of the poor design of the Energy Department's loan guarantee program — something the Government Accountability Office has pointed out since 2008.  And with the congressional investigation ongoing, we may learn more about the Obama administration's role in the loan program — perhaps better supporting the ad's claims. For now, though, information in the public record does not support the ad's claim that the Obama White House is a pay-to-play cash machine for the politically well-connected. We rate this ad's claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097477EC0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/15/americans-prosperity/solyndra-ad-president-barack-obama-taxpayer-money/

Ron Paul says torture is banned under U.S., international law
","
During the CBS-National Journal Republican presidential debate in Spartanburg, S.C., on Nov. 12, 2011, one of the moderators, Major Garrett, invited Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, into a discussion of torture.

Both Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., and former Godfather's Pizza executive Herman Cain had already said they favored allowing interrogators to use waterboarding -- the practice of simulating drowning to elicit information from a detainee. Waterboarding was permitted under the George W. Bush administration, but the policy was rescinded soon after President Barack Obama took office.

""Congressman Paul,"" Garrett said, ""my fighting sense tells me we have a debate about to get launched here. I know you have an opinion and would like to weigh in.""

Paul responded, ""Yes, torture is illegal by our laws. It's illegal by international laws.""

The exchange attracted significant attention following the debate. Obama was asked about it at a news conference in Hawaii. He responded that that Bachmann and Cain are among those who are ""wrong. Waterboarding is torture. It’s contrary to America’s traditions. It’s contrary to our ideals. That’s not who we are. That’s not how we operate. We don’t need it in order to prosecute the war on terrorism. And we did the right thing by ending that practice.""

Meanwhile, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., who ran against Obama in the 2008 presidential campaign, tweeted, ""Very disappointed by statements at SC GOP debate supporting waterboarding. Waterboarding is torture.""

We wondered whether Paul was right that torture is illegal under U.S. and international law. So we decided to check.

First, however, we should note that many -- though not all -- observers consider waterboarding to be a form of torture. We’ll address that issue more fully in a moment. For now, let‘s stick to Paul’s specific claim.

Is torture illegal under U.S. law?

Yes, under several different portions of the law.

• A provision of U.S. law (18 U.S.C. 2340) that took effect in 1994 makes torture a crime.

The law defines torture as ""an act committed by a person acting under the color of law specifically intended to inflict severe physical or mental pain or suffering (other than pain or suffering incidental to lawful sanctions) upon another person within his custody or physical control.""

• A different provision on war crimes addresses torture as well (18 U.S.C. 2441).

The provision reads, ""Whoever, whether inside or outside the United States, commits a war crime … shall be fined under this title or imprisoned for life or any term of years, or both, and if death results to the victim, shall also be subject to the penalty of death. … As used in this section, the term ‘war crime’ (includes) … torture ...""

• Finally, as we noted here, two days after taking office, Obama issued a detailed executive order on torture and related issues.

The executive order said that prisoners ""shall in all circumstances be treated humanely and shall not be subjected to violence to life and person (including murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment, and torture), nor to outrages upon personal dignity (including humiliating and degrading treatment)."" It also specifically nullifies interpretations of federal law on interrogations ""issued by the Department of Justice between September 11, 2001, and January 20, 2009"" under President George W. Bush.

The executive order brings the CIA into line with U.S. Army Field Manual on Interrogation, said said Tom Malinowski, Washington director for Human Rights Watch. This limits interrogators to humane techniques, a standard that already applies as a matter of law to the U.S. military, he said.

Is torture illegal under international law?

This is also a correct statement.

• The Convention Against Torture and Other Forms of Cruel, Inhuman, or Degrading Treatment of Punishment (the Torture Convention) was adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1984 and entered into force on June 26, 1987, after it had been ratified by 20 states. The United States ratified the convention on Oct. 21, 1994.

It defines torture as ""any act by which severe pain or suffering, whether physical or mental, is intentionally inflicted on a person for such purposes as obtaining from him or a third person information or a confession, punishing him for an act he or a third person has committed or is suspected of having committed, or intimidating or coercing him or a third person, or for any reason based on discrimination of any kind, when such pain or suffering is inflicted by or at the instigation of or with the consent or acquiescence of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.""

• The International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. This United Nations agreement -- approved on Dec. 16, 1966, and entered into force on March 23, 1976 -- says in part that ""no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment."" The United States ratified it in June 8, 1992.

• The Geneva Convention relative to the Treatment of Prisoners of War. This convention entered into force on Oct. 21, 1950, and the United States ratified it on Feb. 8, 1955. It bars ""at any time and in any place whatsoever"" all ""violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture"" of ""persons taking no active part in … hostilities, including members of armed forces who have laid down their arms and those placed hors de combat by sickness, wounds, detention, or any other cause.""

• Geneva Convention relative to the Protection of Civilian Persons in Time of War. This convention, This convention was entered into force on Oct. 21, 1950, and the United States ratified it on Feb. 8, 1955 and is virtually identical to the separate Geneva convention above.

• Universal Declaration of Human Rights. This declaration, drafted by a committee that included former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, is not technically a treaty, but it does carry some weight in international law. It was ratified by the United Nations General Assembly on Dec. 10, 1948, by a vote of 48-0 with eight abstentions. The United States was one of the nations voting in favor of the declaration, which says that ""no one shall be subjected to torture or to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment.""

What constitutes torture?

So Paul is on solid ground when he says that ""torture is illegal … by our laws. It's illegal by international laws."" But as we indicated, there’s a significant caveat -- not everyone agrees on what constitutes torture.

""No one will dispute Rep. Paul’s statement,"" said Steven Groves, a fellow at the Heritage Foundation. ""What is in dispute is whether certain interrogation techniques are considered ‘torture’ under either the U.S. or international definition of that term.""

This is an especially important point given that Paul’s comment came in the context of a discussion of waterboarding. Many legal experts believe that waterboarding qualifies as torture under many if not all of the legal definitions cited above. But the Bush administration and its supporters strongly disagreed, calling waterboarding an ""enhanced interrogation technique"" and thus falling outside of the definition of torture.

An Aug. 1, 2002, memo by Assistant Attorney General Jay Bybee and another memo dated the same day by Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Yoo sought to ""set a very high threshold as to what constitutes severe ‘pain or suffering,’"" said Anthony Clark Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University.

These interpretations were overturned by Obama’s Jan. 22, 2009, executive order. But the controversy rages on -- as the Republican debate in South Carolina demonstrates.

We won’t seek to referee this question here, but we do think it’s important to note that some -- though by no means all -- observers would consider Paul’s comment to be a non-sequitur because of their position that waterboarding is not torture.

Our ruling

Paul's comment came immediately after a discussion of waterboarding, and we’ll note that there is not a consensus that waterboarding constitutes torture. That said, Paul’s statement is 100 percent correct: There is no question that torture is barred in both U.S. and international law. We rate Paul’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974E4C00>],/factchecks/2011/nov/15/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-torture-banned-under-us-internationa/

Wisconsin Democratic Party says Gov. Scott Walker received a $7,300 pay raise
","
The reaction to plans by Gov. Scott Walker to freeze the pay of state workers continues to roll in.

And Walker’s own pay continues to be a focal point of his opponents.

On Nov. 9, 2011, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin issued a news release that attempted to fan the fire. The group, which is launching a recall against the first-term Republican governor, says Walker has given himself a pay raise -- and he should give some of it back.

""The rest of Wisconsin is being asked to accept less and suffer his unemployment economy, but apparently Scott Walker thinks he deserves a $7,300 raise,"" state Party Chairman Mike Tate was quoted as saying in the news release.

A raise when pay for others is frozen?

This one sounds familiar.

We looked at this same topic recently when various liberal bloggers said Walker had given himself -- along with other statewide elected officials -- a pay hike. They had misread a sloppily prepared document about the pay changes. We ruled the claim on Walker’s raise False.

The state Democrats revived the topic with their news release, which took Walker to task for ""whining"" about his family’s loss of buying power in a TV interview. We asked party spokesman Graeme Zielinski for backup on the claim that Walker had received a raise.

His reply:

""Why do we have to do your homework for you? Go ask the executive office. Google. You arrive at the same conclusions regardless of whether we help you or not, and then congratulate yourself, so why should we waste our time?""

OK.

Here’s what state law says: Walker is not receiving a raise in January. That would violate Article IV, Section 26 of the the state Constitution.

Here’s how it works.

Walker took office in January and was paid $144,423. That’s $7,331 more than his predecessor, Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle. State law calls for the pay of the governor, other state constitutional officers, and members of the Legislature to be set before their terms of office begin.

In Walker’s case, the higher salaries were proposed by Doyle’s administration and approved by state lawmakers in 2008.

So Walker received one level of pay when he took office. Under the state constitution, that pay will not change for the duration of his four-year term.

Critics have noted that Walker will be making more than Doyle (true), that as Milwaukee County Executive he gave back some of his pay (true) and that he could choose to do the same as governor (true). But that’s not what the party said.

The Democrats called upon Walker to ""return his $7,300 raise."" Their statement continued: ""As pay remains the same for Corrections Officers, Licensed Practical Nurses, Social Workers and Facilities Maintenance Employees, Scott Walker's salary increases by more than $7,331.""
 
So let’s bring this one home. Again.

The state Democrats’ news release states that the governor ""is set to make $143,000,"" and says Walker ""thinks he deserves a $7,300 raise,"" and calls upon the governor  to ""return his $7,300 raise."" The release states that Walker’s ""salary increases by more than $7,331.""

That’s wrong, wrong and still wrong.

The pay for Walker -- or whoever succeeded Doyle as governor in January 2011 -- was long ago established. It’s one amount -- $144,423 -- and it can’t change. Walker can’t give himself a pay raise. It’s right there in the state Constitution.

We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967A7D40>],/factchecks/2011/nov/15/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-gov-scott-walker-r/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Phil Gingrey']","
Gingrey says 8 million ""extra"" people to join Medicaid
","
U.S. Rep. Phil Gingrey thinks states need financial wiggle room in these tight times, and is offering health care legislation to give them room to stretch.

Gingrey’s 2011 State Flexibility Act would nix a lesser-known requirement of last year’s health care reform bill that critics think would make Medicaid, the federal government’s health care program for the poor, too costly for states.

""With an extra 8 million Americans projected to join state Medicaid programs in the next few years, state governments need the flexibility to make cost-saving reforms to Medicaid in order to balance their budgets,"" Gingrey, a Marietta Republican, said in a Sept. 15 press release.  

We know Medicaid is supposed to grow because of health care overhaul, but what’s this about an ""extra"" 8 million people?

Gingrey’s point was that updated estimates published after the passage of last year’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act show that there will be millions more people eligible for Medicaid than legislators were originally told, Gingrey spokeswoman Brooke Sammon said.

This means health care reform will be even more costly than lawmakers anticipated, and states need the help that Gingrey’s bill provides.  

Is that true?

Before we delve into Gingrey’s claim, here’s more on the 2011 State Flexibility Act, which repeals certain federal restrictions on Medcaid funds.

The federal government generally pays half or more of the Medicaid bill. The remainder falls to the states, which administer the program and set some of its rules.

The federal dollars come with strings attached. The state has to distribute the Medicaid money; State rules have to meet basic federal requirements.

Health care reform expands Medicaid in 2014 to give coverage to people with incomes up to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. This change could be costly, so some states want to drop some federal requirements to ease their budget troubles.

Backers of the State Flexibility Act want to give these states the leeway they want. Bill opponents say allowing these changes could leave hundreds of thousands of people, most of them children, uninsured.

Now, let’s take a look at Gingrey’s claim.  As you’ll recall, his point is that 8 million more people are projected to sign up for the program than legislators were originally told.

There’s little doubt that health care reform will increase the overall number of people on Medicaid. But Gingrey’s take on the facts is flawed.

While legislators battled over the reforms in 2009 and 2010, the Congressional Budget Office, which reviews legislation that could impact the federal budget, issued cost projections. They also estimated how much Medicaid enrollment would grow.

About five months after the legislation passed, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, which helps administer Medicaid, issued its own estimates. Its numbers were higher than the CBO’s.

By 2014, the CBO expects that Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, which covers low-income kids who aren’t qualified for Medicaid, will cover 9 million more Americans than it would have without reforms. It would be 16 million in 2016, then 17 million in 2021.

By 2014, CMS expects rolls for Medicaid and CHIP will be 23.3 million higher in 2014, then drop to slightly more than 20 million in 2018 and 2019. CMS published its estimate Oct. 2010 in Health Affairs, a peer-reviewed health policy journal.  

There is a big gap between the CMS and CBO estimates, though Gingrey’s number is a bit off. The difference varies from about 4 million to more than 14 million, not 8 million, depending on the year.

But the higher CMS estimate is not an update of the CBO figure. Instead, they are two separate projections based on different data and assumptions.  They’re not comparable.

Medicaid is such a complicated program that calculating enrollment is tougher than you’d think. CBO bases its enrollment numbers on the Survey of Income and Program Participation, which is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. CMS’ projections use the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, which is conducted by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  

Also, the CBO predicts that the percent of eligible people who join Medicaid will remain roughly the same under health care reform, said Benjamin Sommers, a Harvard University professor who has studied Medicaid enrollment. CMS assumes that a far greater percentage will sign up.

Another difference is that CMS expects enrollment will spike immediately after Medicaid expands in 2014. But the CBO thinks enrollment will take place gradually, their charts show. The estimates become more similar over time, Sommers noted.

Projections by independent groups also vary, but those we reviewed are in line with CBO and CMS estimates.  

For example, the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation’s Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured said that enrollment would be between 15.9 million and 22.8 million higher, depending on how eager people are to join, and the success of the outreach effort.

The Urban Institute estimated that 16.8 million more people would be covered by Medicaid if health care reform took effect in 2010.

How do we rule?

The fact that CBO estimates released in March 2010 were lower than CMS estimates released later that year is not proof that ""extra people"" will join Medicaid, as Gingrey said.

Different government agencies simply arrived at different results, based on different data and assumptions. Since they’re making projections for an unprecedented overhaul in the country’s health care system, it’s reasonable for their results to vary.

All projections foresee a major increase in Medicaid rolls, and Gingrey rightly noted a significant difference between two federal estimates. But he made a mistake when he understood CMS’ estimate as an update of the CBO figures.

Gingrey’s statement is partially accurate but takes things out of context. We therefore rate his claim Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C208F00>],/factchecks/2011/nov/15/phil-gingrey/gingrey-says-8-million-extra-people-join-medicaid/

Tim Kaine says George Allen's flat tax ""plan"" shrinks revenues more than Rick Perry's proposal
","
Democratic U.S. Senate candidate Tim Kaine recently took aim at Republican rival George Allen’s support of a flat tax.

In an Oct. 31 news release, Kaine’s campaign linked a statement by Allen to a flat tax proposal recently made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who is seeking the GOP presidential nomination.

Perry’s plan would allow people to opt out of the current tax system and pay a flat 20 percent federal levy on their income.

During a Fox News interview on Oct. 30, the governor did not dispute host Chris Wallace’s assertion that the flat tax proposal, by the estimates of Perry’s campaign, would reduce federal revenue by $4.7 trillion from 2014 to 2020. ""I think Americans are ready for Washington, D.C., to quit spending money,"" Perry said.

The next day, Kaine’s campaign put out a statement saying Allen supports a 17 percent flat tax -- lower than Perry’s 20 percent.

""That means Allen’s plan would actually shrink revenues further than the Perry plan, forcing even harsher cuts to programs that Virginians depend on,"" the news release said.

We wondered if Kaine was correct in saying Allen backs a flat tax plan that would cut revenues more than Perry’s proposal. 
Under the Texas governor’s plan, flat tax filers would receive a $12,500 exemption for each dependent and would not pay levies on capital gains and social security benefits. Perry’s proposal would preserve deductions on mortgage interest and charitable contributions, as well as state and local taxes, but phases them out for people with incomes of more than $500,000. He would also drop the corporate tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent.

Flat tax supporters say the lower levies would fuel economic expansion; critics say the plans would sap more revenues than can be made up by added growth. An analysis of Perry’s plan by economic consultants John Dunham and Associates, done at the behest of the Perry campaign, said it could drain about $5 trillion in federal revenues through 2020.

What, exactly, is Allen proposing? We’re not sure, and Allen’s campaign isn’t providing many clues.

Kaine, in the news release, based his contention that Allen backs a 17 percent flat tax on a statement Allen made during a June 14, 2011, news conference when he released his economic platform.  Allen endorsed the concept of an optional flat tax.

There are a lot of people who would actually like to say, ""Alright, here is my income, multiply it by, say, .17, and file it on one page,’"" he said.

The Kaine campaign provided us with transcripts and tapes of two other appearances where Allen used the 17 percent flat tax example. In both cases, Allen used the word ""say"" before he uttered 17 percent, creating some hedge room.

Dan Allen, an Allen policy adviser, said the candidate’s wording shows he was throwing out a hypothetical number. A variety of flat tax plans throughout the years have called for flat tax rates of 17 to 25 percent, Dan Allen said.

The text of George Allen’s economic proposals, titled ""The Blueprint for America’s Comeback,"" calls for a flat-tax alternative but offers no details.

We asked Allen’s campaign for specifics -- such as what percentage of income should be subject to a flat tax and what deductions and exemptions should be allowed. But Dan Allen said the Republican has never settled on a single flat tax plan to support.

""To say there’s one Allen plan is not accurate,"" said Dan Allen, who is not related to George Allen.

He referred us to George Allen’s 2010 book, ""What Washington can Learn from the World of Sports,"" in which the Republican said he’s supported a variety of flat tax proposals. One plan lauded in Allen’s book would establish an optional flat levy on combined federal payroll and income taxes, set at 25 percent of gross income.

Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, said he suspects that proposal would drain more revenue than Perry’s plan because it affects two levies. Perry’s proposal only applies to income tax, not payroll tax.

Williams wrote earlier this month that Perry’s proposal ""would dramatically reduce tax revenues,"" by a much as $1 trillion in 2015. But he told us he can’t definitively say whether Allen would cut off more government revenue than Perry because he doesn’t know the details of what Allen is proposing.

Our ruling:

Kaine says Allen’s flat tax ""plan would actually shrink revenues further"" than a flat tax proposal made by Texas Gov. Rick Perry.

Kaine is correct is in saying Perry endorses a 20 percent flat tax on income, but stretches the truth when he says Allen has made a proposal that would set the rate lower. Allen, while endorsing the concept of an optional flat tax, has offered no plan of his own. The basis of Kaine’s charge are Allen’s statements that a flat tax rate could be set at ""say, 17 percent.""

That’s hardly a plan or an endorsement of a flat tax rate, so there’s no substance to compare to Perry’s proposal. We don’t fault Kaine for demanding specificity from Allen. But Kaine goes too far when he tries to create a plan for Allen based on inconclusive statements.

We rate Kaine’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E2A80>],/factchecks/2011/nov/15/tim-kaine/tim-kaine-says-george-allen-flat-tax-plan-shrinks-/

State Rep. Robert Hagan says Ohio isn't a '70-30' Republican state
","
Because of slow population growth, Ohio is losing two seats in the U.S. House of Representatives.  

And because of their statewide sweep last fall, Republicans controlled the process of drawing a new congressional map, which features 12 solidly GOP districts and four that favor Democrats.

Needless to say, the Democrats aren’t fond of their counterparts’ work. They have resisted any deal that doesn’t improve their chances to win more seats and have threatened to take the map to a referendum. After two months of debate, cooler heads have yet to prevail.

Capping a particularly rancorous session on Nov. 3, State Rep. Robert Hagan  stood angrily to complain that redistricting was distracting from more urgent problems. ""Quite frankly,"" the Youngstown Democrat said, ""I’m left wondering what the hell we are doing down here.""

Colorful remarks, indeed. But PolitiFact Ohio was more interested in what Hagan said after the session. In an interview with Marc Kovac, a Statehouse bureau chief for several newspapers, Hagan stressed his preference for a map that better fits the state’s political pedigree.

""The governor won this state with 49 percent,"" Hagan said of Republican John Kasich’s 2010 victory over Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. ""We had some of the closest races in the House in history. So you’re not dealing with this 70/30, like they want to make it.""

Hagan’s argument, and those similarly made by his fellow Democrats, is that new lines should reflect their belief that Ohio is split about 50/50 between the two parties. A map that favors the GOP in 12 of 16 districts could give Republicans 75 percent of Ohio’s congressional seats.

We decided to take a closer look at the examples Hagan cites as justification for equality.

First, Kasich’s margin of victory has been well-documented. But to cover all bases, we confirmed with the Ohio secretary of state’s office that Kasich received 49 percent of the vote to Strickland’s 47 percent. The remaining four percent went to third-party or write-in candidates.

By mentioning this race, Hagan implied that Ohio is evenly divided. We found Republicans won by five points or more in all but one of the five other statewide contests last year. The exception: Mike DeWine’s 1.28-point victory over incumbent Democratic Attorney General Richard Cordray.

Examining the second part of Hagan’s claim involved more scouring of past election results. In 2010, according to the secretary of state’s website, six Ohio House races featured margins of two points or fewer. All six of these races were decided by fewer than 1,000 votes.

The closest was in the 99th District -- Ashtabula County and a slice of Trumbull County -- where Republican Casey Kozlowski beat Democratic Rep. Deborah Newcomb by 137 votes.

Another squeaker came in the Franklin County-encompassing 21st District, where the GOP’s Mike Duffey beat Democrat David Robinson by 377 votes. In Hamilton County, Democratic Rep. Connie Pillich kept her 28th District seat by finishing 602 votes ahead of Republican Mike Wilson.

Hagan confirmed to PolitiFact Ohio that those three were the races he was thinking about when speaking to Kovac. But was 2010 really an anomaly in terms of razor-thin margins of victory?

Our review of Ohio House races dating to 2002 found no contest quite as close as the Kozlowski-Newcomb match. Another six races in 2008 and seven in 2006 were decided by two percentage points or fewer. Three candidates in 2004 won by fewer than 500 votes.

For the sake of context, it’s important to note that the Ohio House has 99 seats, so the half-dozen or so nail-biters are exceptions. Many House elections are blowouts, and some candidates don’t even draw an opponent. It’s also important to point out that in the six tight races in 2010, Democrats and Republicans split the seats, with three going to each party.

The makeup of the House today is 59 Republicans, 40 Democrats. That’s more like 60/40 than 50/50. If Democrats had won all six of the close races, the makeup would be 56-43.

Unfortunately, there is no perfect accounting for party affiliation in Ohio. Voters here do not specify party when registering -- only when voting in a primary. But that’s an unreliable measure of true political identity. Republicans are known to cross over into Democratic primaries and vice versa, particularly during hotly contested battles for a party’s presidential nomination.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted’s turnout numbers anyway. Of those who voted in the 2010 primaries, 48 percent cast Republican ballots, while 42 percent cast Democratic ballots. So even by this measure, there is no evidence of a 50/50 split.

Our best guess is that the 50/50 talk is part anecdotal, part wishful thinking. Ohio is known as a swing state with fickle tastes. In a four-year stretch, voters here elected to the U.S. Senate a known liberal in Sherrod Brown and a known conservative in Rob Portman. The state went for Democrat Bill Clinton twice in the 1990s, twice for Republican George W. Bush in the aughts, then for Democrat Barack Obama in 2008. But since 1991, Republicans have occupied the governor’s chair with the exception of the four years that Strickland served.

Then again, as Hagan correctly noted, Ohio isn’t a 70/30 state, either. His arguments -- and those from his Democratic colleagues -- would benefit from more context, though.

For one, there’s no bulletproof way of suggesting the state is 50/50 -- a claim Hagan did not make explicitly in his comments to Kovac. Hagan instead implicitly pointed to results of two elections as proof of Ohio’s political parity: Kasich’s narrow gubernatorial victory and a batch of close Ohio House races. Regarding the latter, Hagan remarked on ""some of the closest races in the House in history."" It is clear that several of those battles match that description.

Another look at a favorite Republican talking point
","
Sometimes talking points are just so good that no matter how many times we point out they’re wrong, politicians keep using them again and again and again, broken-record style.

Case in point: The Republican bit that some Democrat or another voted to cut a whopping $500 billion from Medicare by supporting President Obama’s Affordable Care Act.

Just how pervasive is this claim? Well, PolitiFact Oregon addressed it more than a year ago when Scott Bruun tried to use it against Rep. Kurt Schrader and called the claim Mostly False.

But that’s not all: PolitiFact National gave Michele Bachmann a Mostly False in September for claiming Obama was stealing $500 billion from Medicare. In July, PolitiFact Texas gave a state representative a Mostly False for claiming $500 billion in Medicare cuts were coming. And PolitiFact Ohio served up an out-and-out False to the National Republican Senatorial Committee in June for claiming that Sen. Sherrod Brown had voted to cut $500 billion from Medicare.

There are more, but you probably get the idea.

Naturally, we were a little surprised, then, when Rob Cornilles, the Republican candidate for the open 1st congressional district seat, accused state Sen. Suzanne Bonamici, his Democratic opponent, of supporting a $500 billion cut.

And yet, there it was, during a speech he delivered Wednesday: ""Senator Bonamici says she supports the $500 billion cut to Medicare passed last year.""

There’s a small bit of truth here. The Affordable Care Act does reduce Medicare spending by $500 billion over the next 10 years. But here’s the catch: Those dollars aren’t taken out of the current budget, they are not actual cuts, and nowhere does the bill actually eliminate any current benefits.

The $500 billion is all in future spending reductions and come through the law’s attempts to slow projected growth, not cut spending.

PolitiFact National has highlighted the biggest bits of savings: About $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in Medicare payments to health care providers. Another $36 billion comes from increasing premiums for higher-income beneficiaries. Administrative changes land another $12 billion in savings. A new national board is set to come up with $15.5 billion in savings -- but can’t get those savings from a reduction in benefits. The last big chunk of $136 billion comes in changes to the Medicare Advantage program, which has become more expensive than initially anticipated.

Still, given all these changes, Medicare spending is expected to increase -- something we pointed out in our fact check on Bruun a year ago. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.

As we said last year, while it’s true that the government is looking to reduce the growth of future spending, the Affordable Care Act does not eliminate $500 billion out of the current budget for Medicare. Most important, there are no cuts to guaranteed Medicare benefits.

We wanted to do two things before we gave a final ruling on the subject.

First up, we called Bonamici’s campaign to make sure she even supports the Affordable Care Act. She confirmed that, while she doesn’t think it’s perfect, had she been in office when the final vote was taken, she would have been a ""yes."" In a statement she added, ""Let me be absolutely clear: I do not support cutting Medicare benefits. I believe Medicare is a fundamental promise our nation owes to seniors and keeping Medicare financially stable is simply a matter of getting our priorities straight.""

Second, we gave a call to Cornilles’ campaign to see if it still felt his statement was truthful. Mary Anne Ostrom, his campaign manager, said the campaign stood by the comment. She pointed to an Oregonian article before the health care bill passed that described the proposed savings as ""cuts"" (which it does, but it doesn’t make the claim any more accurate) and to a Washington Post Fact Checker article that she said backed them up -- at least to some degree.

A quick read through that article, and we come to the same point: ""The health care bill tries to identify ways to save money, and so the $500 billion figure comes from the difference over 10 years between anticipated Medicare spending (what is known as ‘the baseline’) and the changes the law makes to reduce spending.""

The author also noted -- and it’s worth repeating here -- that Republican leaders have supported the same cuts. ""In the House Republican budget, lawmakers repealed the Obama health care law but retained all but $10 billion of the nearly $500 billion in Medicare savings, suggesting the actual policies enacted to achieve these spending reductions were not that objectionable to GOP lawmakers.""

Ultimately, even the Washington Post story that Cornilles claims as support found the claim to have ""significant omissions and/or exaggerations.""

We pointed that out to Ostrom, who simply said the campaign didn’t agree with our interpretation -- or the previous PolitiFact interpretations for that matter.

That brings us to our ruling. Generally, we’d give this a ""Mostly False"" given that there is a small kernel of truth to the statement. But we also have a policy of taking into account whether the speaker is willfully repeating something we’ve said wasn’t true before -- and in this case we have said it several times.

For that reason, we’re giving Cornilles a False for his statement that Bonamici supports $500 billion in cuts to Medicare.

Newt Gingrich says by 2014, there will be one administrator for every teacher on college campuses
","
During a Republican presidential debate in Michigan on Nov. 9, 2011, Newt Gingrich denounced the federal student loan program as a way for students to stay in school longer, blindly tolerant of how expensive college has become ""because they don't see the cost.""

Then he cited a surprising statistic. ""By 2014,"" Gingrich said during the debate at Oakland University in Rochester, Mich., ""there will be one administrator for every teacher on college campuses in the United States.""

We located an April story in the print and online literary magazine n+1 that made mention of a similar figure. Author Malcolm Harris wrote, ""If current trends continue, the Department of Education estimates that by 2014 there will be more administrators than instructors at American four-year nonprofit colleges.""

When we contacted Harris for his source, he pointed us to a study by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity, a Washington-based group that studies ""the rising costs and stagnant efficiency in higher education.""

The report said, ""The growth of non-instructional staff is so fast that if these job growth trends were to continue, the number of managers and support staff (administration) at four-year, not-for-profit colleges would outnumber instructors by 2014. Using the average annual percentage increase between 1997 and 2007 for each of the three job categories (managers, support staff and instructors) as the respective rate of growth, and combining support staff and managers into one category as administration.""

To back up this finding, the report cited statistics culled from the Integrated Post-secondary Education Data System, a database produced by the Department of Education.

So Gingrich has some support for his claim.

An important caveat is that different people may use a different definition of ""administrator"" in the college setting. In the Center for College Affordability and Productivity study, ""administrator"" refers to the aggregate of ""executive, administrative, and managerial"" positions and ""other professional staff,"" including support staff. But that’s a pretty broad definition.

Jane Wellman, executive director of the Delta Cost Project, a Washington-based policy group, which has also studied this issue notes that ""the ‘professional and technical’ category includes student service people, financial aid administrators, researchers, clinicians, nurses and other hospital employees, computer people, etc. The ‘executive, administrative and managerial’ are the front-line college administrators, and they’re a fairly small category.""

Complicating matters further is that changes in hiring patterns have meant that the number of instructional personnel has been rising even as total spending on instruction has been rising more slowly than administrative costs.

A story published in the Washington Monthly that cited the Delta Cost Project’s work noted that ""between 1998 and 2008, America’s private colleges increased spending on instruction by 22 percent while increasing spending on administration and staff support by 36 percent.""

Yet somewhat paradoxically, faculty represented a growing share of college employees between 2000 and 2008, mostly because of increases in hiring of part-time faculty. ""One of the major trends in college staffing is the growth in part-time instructors relative to full-time instructors,"" said Daniel L. Bennett, research fellow at the Center for College Affordability and Productivity

The author of the Washington Monthly article, Johns Hopkins University political scientist Benjamin Ginsberg, wrote that if universities gave faculty members more influence and let them handle more administrative work in addition to teaching, ""more resources might be available for educational programs and student support, the actual items for which parents, donors, and funding agencies think they are paying.""

A final point: Much of the teaching load at universities today is handled by graduate students rather than faculty members.

Our ruling

Gingrich said during the debate that ""by 2014, there will be one administrator for every teacher on college campuses in the United States."" A study by the Center for College Affordability and Productivity backs up that claim. But it uses a broad definition of ""administrator,"" and narrower definitions would make the statement incorrect. In addition, faculty represented a growing share of college employees between 2000 and 2008, in part because of the growth in part-time instructors. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1F6E80>],/factchecks/2011/nov/14/newt-gingrich/newt-gingrich-says-2014-there-will-be-one-administ/

John Birch Society says Wisconsin bill would let police arrest people for violating pet leash laws and other minor offenses
","
The John Birch Society gained a national following in the 1960s when, according to a video done for the New York Times, the ultra-conservative group ""saw communism everywhere: in the civil rights movement, in Congress, in the office of the United States president.""

Its profile may have faded, but the Wisconsin-based organization is still active.

Among other things, the John Birch Society holds seminars around the country to oppose Agenda 21, a United Nations program it says ""seeks for the government to curtail your freedom to travel as you please, own a gas-powered car, live in suburbs or rural areas, and raise a family.""

The society is also warning of a little-noticed measure pending in the Wisconsin Legislature, Assembly Bill 237.

In an article critical of the bill that was posted on its website Nov. 4, 2011, the group said that under the bill, ""minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws, seat belt laws, parking infractions, etc., would now be arrest-able offenses.""

Handcuffs and jail for letting a dog run loose, failing to buckle up or parking improperly?

Let’s find out.

To support its claim about the bill -- which passed one Assembly committee, 9-0, on Oct. 25, 2011, and is waiting to be scheduled for a vote by the full Assembly -- the society’s article cited two things: The bill’s language and a list of offenses that would become ""arrest-able.""

The one-sentence bill simply says law enforcement officers ""may arrest a person for a law violation that is punishable by a civil forfeiture.""

The word arrest indicates the claim by the John Birch Society is on the right track. Indeed, the claim suggests the arrests allowed under the bill would be a dramatic change from the status quo.

An analysis by the state Legislative Reference Bureau doesn’t elaborate much on the bill, which was introduced by Rep. Joel Kleefisch, R-Oconomowoc, husband of Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch.

But a memo from the state Legislative Council, which provides legal and other research services to the Legislature, said the bill provides law enforcement officers ""additional arrest authority"" for state civil forfeitures -- non-criminal offenses prohibited by state law.  

The bill is needed mainly for two reasons, said Joel Kleefisch’s research assistant, Stephanie Kundert: to provide uniform enforcement around Wisconsin of state forfeitures, which are punishable by a fine; and to protect law enforcement agencies from lawsuits like one filed against the Brookfield Police Department in suburban Milwaukee.

In that case, a Milwaukee woman was arrested at gunpoint in July 2010 after attending a Brookfield church service while wearing a holstered handgun. The woman, assisted by the Wisconsin Carry gun-rights group, filed a federal civil rights suit, which the City of Brookfield settled in January 2011 by paying her $7,500.

One legal claim the woman made was police had no legal authority to arrest her and that helped expose the need for the Kleefisch bill, said Brookfield Assistant Police Chief Dean Collins, who is the main promoter of the bill.

By way of background, Collins, who served more than 30 years in the Milwaukee Police Department, pointed out that state law already gives police the power to make arrests under three sets of circumstances: 
For felony and misdemeanor crimes. 
For local ordinance violations, such as a dog at large. 
For traffic offenses, including parking violations or failing to wear a seat belt. 
So, despite what the John Birch Society claim suggests, a dog at large is already an arrest-able offense in communities that have such an ordinance; and failing to wear a seat belt and parking violations are among traffic violations that already are arrest-able offenses statewide.

But, ironically, no state law gives officers the power to enforce state forfeitures.

""It’s a void in the law and it was just not noticed for many, many years,"" Collins said at an Oct. 19, 2011 public hearing on the bill.

The Kleefisch bill -- endorsed by state associations that represent Wisconsin’s police chiefs, sheriffs and district attorneys -- is needed so officers can enforce state forfeitures, such as the one that prohibits dogs at large, in communities where no such local ordinance exists, Collins said.

More importantly, he said, the bill would give legal authority for officers statewide to enforce more serious state forfeitures that are not covered by local ordinances.

In a letter to lawmakers, Collins cited a number of offenses many would consider serious: 
The list also include offenses that might be considered less serious: trespassing on private property; sending unsolicited faxes; fireworks violations; body passing at sports events; improper use of laser pointers and refusal to pay bus fare.

Haven’t police and sheriff’s deputies already been enforcing such things?

Kundert said many police agencies have been doing so for many years, even though they lack explicit legal authority. Officers investigate a state forfeiture violation and report it to the county district attorney. In turn, the district attorney can file an action in Circuit Court that can result in a person being ordered to pay a fine.

Collins predicted that if the Kleefisch bill does not become law, some law enforcement agencies will stop taking action for state forfeitures for fear of being sued like Brookfield was. Wisconsin Carry, which opposes the bill, says it ""vastly expands police authority"" and won’t legally protect police agencies that make arrests like Brookfield did in the gun case.

A final point before we conclude.

Collins stressed that the word arrest has broad meaning in the law. An arrest can involve being handcuffed and put in jail; but legally a person is under arrest just by being detained and questioned by an officer, he said.

Our conclusion

The John Birch Society said that under a bill pending in the Legislature, ""minor offenses such as violating pet leash laws, seat belt laws, parking infractions, etc., would now be arrest-able offenses.""

Dog at large violations are already arrest-able in communities that have such ordinances and seat belt and parking violations are arrest-able statewide -- though the arrest typically does not involve handcuffs or jail, but rather a person being detained or perhaps ending up with a fine.

The bill would make numerous state forfeitures arrest-able. But that would simply give legal authority for something officers already doing -- detaining and sometimes referring to prosecutors people suspected of violating non-criminal state laws.

The John Birch Society statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information. That’s our definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C208F40>],/factchecks/2011/nov/14/john-birch-society/john-birch-society-says-wisconsin-bill-would-let-p/
"['Georgia', 'Bankruptcy', 'Lynn Westmoreland']","
Georgia leads nation in an unfortunate category, lawmaker says
","
U.S. Rep. Lynn Westmoreland has made a sobering observation about his home state of Georgia in town hall meetings and to others who’ll listen.

Georgia has had ""more bank failures than any other state,"" the Republican from Coweta County said at a GOP breakfast meeting in Newnan.

Coweta County lost all three of its banks, The Times-Herald of Newnan reported. Westmoreland believes the federal government should not have adopted the bailout plan in 2008 for some of the nation’s largest banks. The congressman believes the government should have let some of them fail and provided more support for community banks.

""These are community banks that have been around for 100 years,"" Westmoreland was quoted by the newspaper as saying. ""We're talking generational wealth. We're talking about people losing their savings, their retirement, funds for the education of their children. All of that has gone down the drain.""

The housing foreclosure crisis in Georgia has been well-documented. It began in some metro Atlanta counties about a decade ago and became a statewide problem as the impact of the Great Recession took hold in 2008. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the congressman was right about a similar economic impact on banks here in Georgia.

The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. keeps track of bank failures by state. Since Westmoreland’s statement wasn’t specific about what time frame he was talking about, we crunched the numbers for several years.

Georgia had 19 bank failures this year when Westmoreland made his statement. That was more than any other state, according to the FDIC. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported a 23rd bank failure, Community Bank of Rockmart, in its Nov. 10 editions. Florida is second with 11 bank failures. Illinois is a distant third with seven bank failures.

Next, we went back to 2008, when the recession was at its worst and the bank bailout plan was adopted, and we counted how many bank failures there have been since then. Again, Georgia was first with 70 bank failures, according to the most recent FDIC data. And again, Florida was second with 56 bank failures.

If only it was like this in college football, Georgia fans might say.

We also decided to examine how many bank failures there have been in each state since 2006. Five years seemed like a good time span to examine bank failures. Once again, Georgia was first with a total of 71 bank failures since then.

So what’s the problem in Georgia?

Many community banks invested heavily in the real estate market during the boom years of the early 2000s. When the economy stumbled, so did those banks because the loans weren’t being paid. Most of Georgia's failures came after the banks crossed below a certain threshold for capital after those loan losses, the AJC has reported.

The banks in Georgia lost less than Florida and other states such as California. Those failed Georgia banks had fewer assets than those in California, Florida and Illinois.

Westmoreland was not talking about the size of those bank failures when he spoke in Coweta County. The congressman said bank failures. Therefore, we rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C208CC0>],/factchecks/2011/nov/14/lynn-westmoreland/georgia-leads-nation-unfortunate-category-lawmaker/
"['Message Machine 2012', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Texas leaders cut $15 billion from state budget
","
Proclaiming himself a ""doer, not a talker,"" Republican presidential hopeful Rick Perry makes two claims about his accomplishments as the Texas governor in a television ad that has been broadcast in Iowa and New Hampshire. 
""In Texas, we created 40 percent of the new jobs in the entire country since June of 2009,"" Perry says. ""And we cut a record $15 billion from our state budget."" 
We’ve checked numerous claims about Texas job growth, including one by Perry in June 2011 that 48 percent of all jobs created in the United States since June 2009 were in the Lone Star State. Half True, we said, pointing out that there are many ways to slice and dice employment statistics. Also, experts have advised us that a state’s job performance — be they gains or losses — shouldn’t be pinned on the top officeholder. Too many factors are in play for a single state official to merit credit or blame. 
For this article, we wondered whether a record $15 billion was cut from the state budget, as Perry says. 
As backup for that claim, Perry’s campaign pointed to a May 2011 report on the two-year state budget that the Texas Legislature approved and Perry signed into law this year. The budget covers fiscal 2012, which began Sept. 1, 2011, and fiscal 2013. 
The report by the Legislative Budget Board — whose staff members analyze state appropriations — compares spending in the 2012-13 budget ($172.3 billion), including state and federal money, with that in the previous budget cycle ($187.5 billion). The difference is $15.2 billion. 
(Since Perry’s ad began airing, the board has released updated budget figures that are slightly different from those in the May 2011 report. That information was not available to the Perry campaign, however, so our research focuses on the earlier report.) 
The $15 billion reduction amount stands alone for the past half-century, according to John Barton, a spokesman for the budget board’s staff. From 1951 through 2009, Barton said, no Legislature budgeted less spending from all sources than what had been spent in the previous budget. Before then, he said, Texas lawmakers did not write a single budget covering all state agencies. 
So, there’s a basis for Perry’s ""record"" $15 billion boast. 
Next, we looked at the figures behind it and found three factors that seem to diminish Perry’s claim. Let’s take them one by one. 
First, Perry’s cited spending reductions were primarily federal funds, most of them being one-time stimulus dollars that lawmakers knew wouldn’t be available for the 2012-13 budget cycle. 
According to the LBB report, federal funding dropped 25 percent, compared with a 2 percent cut in state general revenue spending — the expenditures over which the governor and lawmakers have the most sway. In raw figures, federal funding fell by $18.2 billion while state general revenue spending dropped $1.6 billion. (Increases in other spending categories offset some of those losses, bringing the net reduction to $15.2 billion.) 
More than half the drop in federal money, $11.8 billion of it, traces to the absence of one-time federal economic stimulus aid that Congress approved in 2009, Barton told us. Texas lawmakers used that money primarily for education and health care costs in the 2010-11 budget. 
Second, the 2012-13 budget is expected to grow, which will drive down Perry’s $15 billion reduction figure. 
It was much-reported during this year’s legislative session that lawmakers failed to appropriate enough state money to cover all of the projected Medicaid costs for 2012-13. That means that absent major changes in demand for services or program costs, the Legislature will have to pony up more money for Medicaid — a state-federal partnership providing health insurance to low-income Americans — before the end of the 2013 fiscal year. 
In its May 2011 report, the budget board staff estimated that lawmakers would need to infuse the program with an additional $4.4 billion in state dollars. 
If the $4.4 billion in state aid is added on, the federal government will send the state an estimated $5.3 billion in federal Medicaid ""matching"" funds, according to Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission. 
So, total spending in the 2012-13 Texas budget could increase by nearly $10 billion, although Goodman cautioned that actual Medicaid spending will probably vary from the projections reached this year based on factors such as the size of the state’s caseload and medical costs. 
An extra $10 billion in spending for 2012-13 would bring the total budget to about $182 billion and reduce Perry’s budget cut to about $5.5 billion. 
Third, it was also well-reported that lawmakers reduced spending on public education in the 2012-13 budget by delaying a regular $2.3 billion state payment to school districts a few days, pushing it from the end of the 2013 fiscal year into the next budget cycle. 
Considering these factors, the cuts in the 2012-13 budget don’t look as large as Perry touts in his campaign ad. Counting the effects of postponing Medicaid and public school expenditures and including additional federal aid that would roll in if the state commits more to Medicaid, the 2012-13 budget may actually be closer to $184.3 billion. Compare that total to the $187.5 billion spending figure for 2010-11 in the LBB report, and the budget cut shrinks to about $3.2 billion. 
There is another perspective on the question of how much the Legislature cut the budget this year. Eva DeLuna Castro, an analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning Austin think tank, told us that any analysis by her organization would also consider as cuts the difference between 2012-13 appropriations and the amount of money the state would have had to spent to maintain current service levels in its programs, including the cost of school-age population growth. DeLuna Castro said that in this vein, the budget cuts for 2012-13 were ""closer to $22 billion."" 
We also looked into what experts at the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a conservative Austin think tank, have said about the 2012-13 budget. 
In a May 26, 2011, statement, Talmadge Heflin, director of the foundation’s Center for Fiscal Policy, praised Texas as ""leading the way in showing that government can be made smaller."" He also noted, however, that $12 billion of the $15 billion reduction ""comes from the expiration of the federal stimulus package."" Heflin continued: ""Just as those one-time stimulus funds artificially inflated the current budget, the end of those funds makes it look like the Texas Legislature cut deeper than it really did."" 
Our ruling 
Nobody disputes that the latest Texas budget spends considerably less than the previous one — and Perry’s $15 billion figure has a basis. 
However, much of the ballyhooed reduction reflects the loss of one-time federal stimulus aid — a ""cut"" originating in Congress and one that was not in Perry’s control. Put another way, the budget he signed into law trimmed state spending (which the governor can directly influence) by $1.6 billion. 
Also, Perry’s calculation doesn’t acknowledge the state’s underfunding of Medicaid and a delayed education payment — which, if counted, would knock the budget cut down to about $3 billion in total, $12 billion less than what Perry celebrates. 
We rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B52180>],/factchecks/2011/nov/14/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-leaders-cut-15-billion-state/
"['Ohio', 'Federal Budget', 'Poverty', 'Marcia Fudge']","
Rep. Marcia Fudge says more than half of food stamp recipients are children
","
There’s not much variety in a food stamp diet. Just ask Rep. Marcia Fudge. She began Nov. 7, 2011, dining on less than $5 a day, a self-imposed restriction to raise awareness about poverty in America.

The congresswoman took what’s known as the Food Stamp Challenge. Her budget for one week’s worth of food came to $31.50, the average weekly benefit for an adult food stamp recipient in the United States.

Her menu included such delicacies as cabbage and kale (flavored with pork neck bones), rotisserie chicken for protein, bananas and potatoes.

Just prior to taking the challenge, Fudge championed the food stamp program,, formally known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, with Al Sharpton on MSNBC.

Fudge and Sharpton both were critical of a House-passed bill drafted by Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin which calls for cuts in the food stamp program. Fudge said she thought it would be tragic to reduce food aid to needy Americans in the name of balancing the budget.

""More than half of the people on food stamps today are children,"" Fudge told Sharpton.

PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Fudge’s claim.

But first, some background on Ryan’s budget. It calls for reducing the federal outlay for food stamps by an average of $12.7 billion over 10 years. The bill would shift funding for the program to block grants provided to the states, which would then administer the payouts.

Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert said his boss believes in the food stamp program but wants to make it more sustainable over time by changing the way it’s administered and by reducing budget increases going forward.

Enrollment in food stamps has grown from 17.3 million in 2001 to 44.3 million today, while funding has grown from less than $18 billion in 2001 to more than $80 billion today.

PolitiFact Ohio isn’t commenting on whether Ryan or Fudge have the best recipe for the food stamp program going forward. We check the data about food stamp recipients.

The United States Department of Agriculture administers the food stamp program, and according to its records, 47 percent of the recipients in 2010 were under the age of 18. That’s down from 49 percent in 2008.

Fudge pegged the figure at more than half while talking to Sharpton, so we asked her office to explain.

Fudge press secretary Laura Allen cited the 49 percent figure as well as another USDA statistic that claimed 52 percent of SNAP households include children.

""The congresswoman could have been more specific, but since 52 percent of households that receive SNAP include children, there is a strong argument that more than half of people ‘on SNAP’ or using the benefits are children,"" Allen wrote in an e-mail.

Not necessarily.

Just because half the households have children, doesn’t mean half the total recipients are children.

It turned out the 52 percent figure was taken from a USDA document that shows that in Fudge’s district in Ohio between 2007 and 2009, 51.5 percent of households receiving food stamps had children below the age of 18. A separate document for 2010 puts the figure at 48.7 percent.
 
Allen went on to say the Congresswoman’s slight overstatement was ""an honest mistake.""

Fair enough. And as mistakes go, this one is pretty small.

Roughly half the people on food stamps are children. Fudge described it as more than half based on data that was specific to her district. The actual figure for the national average is 47 percent, a point of clarification.
