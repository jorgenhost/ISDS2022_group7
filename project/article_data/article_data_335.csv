Scott Walker says college tuition has risen at four times the rate of inflation
","Gov. Scott Walker has put caps on tuition increases, even amid budget cuts, saying he wants to be sure there is ""affordable"" tuition for the University of Wisconsin System. He caught our attention May 16, 2016 when he said, on conservative talker Charlie Sykes radio show on WTMJ-AM, that rising tuition costs are far from unique. ""This is not just picking on the University of Wisconsin System,"" Walker said. ""This is a nationwide trend. Since ‘78, I think, tuition nationwide has gone up something like four times the rate of inflation."" We have checked many claims about the cost of college tuition. In 2014, for instance, PolitiFact National examined this claim: ""In 1978, a student who worked a minimum-wage summer job could afford to pay a year’s full tuition at the 4-year public university of their choice.""   Based on national averages, a person could pay in-state tuition at most public universities with their summer earnings, but not for any school, such as one out of state. The claim was rated Mostly True. We decided to check out Walker’s claim, too. Behind the numbers When asked for backup, Walker’s team sent us to a Chart of the Day published by Bloomberg in 2012. The article said college tuition since 1978 has increased four times faster than inflation, but didn’t cite a source for the statistic. We turned to the National Center for Education Statistics, the primary federal entity for collecting and analyzing education data. The center, part of the U.S. Department of Education, provided data on undergraduate tuition going back to 1978. The numbers come from its annual surveys of colleges. In 1978, tuition and required fees at all institutions averaged $1,073. By 2014, it increased more than 1,000 percent, topping $11,000. That’s a big jump in cost. But Walker’s claim compared the increasing price of tuition to inflation. The Consumer Price Index is one measure of inflation, or how over time the value of money decreases. The CPI measures the change in cost over time for a representative basket of goods, such as food, housing, transportation and education. From 1978 to 2014, the index increased about 246 percent. So, clearly, the rate of increase for tuition has surpassed inflation. And the percent increase in tuition is more than four times the increase in inflation, as Walker claimed. Since Walker talked in the context of Wisconsin’s public four-year college system, we took a look at tuition prices for those schools. Tuition at those institutions shot up from around $600 to more than $8,000 by 2014. That’s more than a 1,000 percent increase. What about the total cost of an education? Tuition is just a portion of the cost of a college degree and the costs for room and board have increased much slower than tuition. If tuition is combined with room and board, the price increase is about three times inflation since 1978, according to the same education and inflation data. Some experts say the out-of-pocket costs for tuition should be examined, rather than the published rates. Typically, few students pay the full amount, since many also get scholarships, grants and other financial aid. The College Board reports data on the net tuition paid by students, but that data doesn’t begin until the 1990s. Sandy Baum, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute and co-author of the Board’s Trends in College Pricing and Trends in Student Aid reports, said the growth of actual prices is smaller than published prices, though still substantial. For example, from 1990 until 2014, net tuition paid by in-state students at public four-year schools across the country doubled. In contrast, published tuition prices more than tripled during the same time period. Our rating Walker said since 1978, college ""tuition nationwide has gone up something like four times the rate of inflation."" Average tuition prices from the National Center for Education Statistics and inflation rates from the Bureau of Labor Statistics back up his point. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2016/jun/09/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-college-tuition-has-risen-four-t/

Florida black bears aren't apex predators, Hillsborough County commissioner says
","A Hillsborough County commissioner who opposes declaring open season on Florida black bears said the animals aren’t the threat hunting advocates make them out to be. Stacy White, a self-proclaimed ""avid outdoorsman"" who hunts, backed a resolution to symbolically oppose a state-sanctioned bear hunt in Florida this year. The commission approved the resolution 6-0 at its June 2 meeting. The state will decide June 22 whether to allow another hunt. Some opponents of the measure had spoken in favor of a bear hunt. Phil Walters of GatorGuides.com said Hillsborough County didn’t need to pass the resolution, because the county didn’t even have a black bear population. But commissioners ran that risk if there was no bear hunt. ""Do you really want bears being brought into this county?"" Walters asked. ""If you think you’ve got problems with wildlife now, wait until you have a top apex predator in close proximity to people."" White later responded by saying Walters had mischaracterized bears as apex predators — meaning they are at the very top of the food chain. ""One of the folks that spoke during the public comment portion of the meeting called the Florida black bear a top apex predator. That is absolutely, unequivocally false,"" White said. He followed up with Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission (or FWC) statistics that said a black bear’s diet ""usually consists of 80 percent plants, 15 percent insects and 5 percent animal matter."" White told PolitiFact Florida he meant apex predator in the figurative sense, to refute what he saw as Walters’ implication that bears may hunt down humans. Bears ""certainly don’t actively hunt animal prey,"" White told us. He has a point there, bear experts said, but using the term ""apex predator"" largely depends on how it’s being applied. Bear complexities Florida’s black bear population had dwindled to 300 some four decades ago before the species was protected and hunting was outlawed. In 2012, the FWC removed bears from the ""threatened"" list as their numbers rebounded. Recent estimates say there are about 4,350 bears statewide today. As more people moved into bear habitat, the state fielded thousands of complaints about them hanging out in hot tubs, swinging in hammocks and raiding garbage bins. Then, beginning in 2013, bears attacked and mauled four women. That led to a decision in 2015 to schedule the first hunt in 21 years as a way to control the population.  A 320-bear limit was set for the weeklong hunt, but the state shut it down after just two days when permitted hunters had killed 304 bears. Among the reasons bears venture into populated areas (beyond loss of habitat and increased numbers) is that bears are omnivores, and will eat just about anything they can find — including what’s in humans’ garbage cans, barbecue grills and pet-food dishes.   Their diet mostly includes berries, acorns, grasses, seeds, plant shoots, and even moss and ferns. If they do eat other animals, many times they are of the six-legged variety, such as ants, wasps and beetles. If a bear digs into a beehive, chances are they want the bees and not their honey. Bears also will eat the odd armadillo or possum, but often those are scavenged from already dead carcasses. Playing dead is not a safe way to avoid being eaten by a bear. ""Bears definitely are carnivores and predators. Whether they are a ‘top predator’ is open to one’s perspective,"" said Thomas Eason, the FWC’s director of wildlife and habitat conservation. ""That connotation is not commonly used in the scientific arena for black bears."" That leads to an interesting juxtaposition: Bears are, by the standard definition, apex predators. They’re at the top of the food chain, and practically nothing can or would even try to kill an adult bear for food. But how you use the term apex predator matters, too. ""If you are thinking about apex predators being a danger to people that they might see as food, as a polar bear might, then black bears are not a big issue,"" University of Florida wildlife biologist Bill Giuliano said. ""However, their omnivorous tendencies and ability to live in close proximity to people is a concern."" Bears don’t look to hunt people down, as the term apex predator may evoke, but events can potentially turn sour quickly if they are around people. If bears, especially a sow with cubs, get startled or cornered (perhaps by a dog you’ve let out of the house), they will try to escape. That escape route may be through you. In that case, we asked, what could kill a 300-pound adult black bear, short of hitting it with a car? ""Nothing besides a bullet,"" Giuliano said. Our ruling White said it's not true that Florida black bears are an ""apex predator."" That’s overstating the case a little bit. Experts said bears are apex predators in the sense that nothing in their ecosystem naturally hunts them for food. Bears are definitely capable of injuring or even killing someone, but they don’t normally seek out humans. Bears are omnivorous, and any interaction between hungry bears and people most often involves the bear getting caught rooting in the trash.

"['Georgia', 'Population', 'Video for Atlanta Super Bowl bid presentation']","
Super Bowl bid video overstates Atlanta population
","There were high-fives all around last month when Atlanta was awarded the 2019 Super Bowl, a major coup for the city and its still-under-construction Mercedes-Benz Stadium. Part of the sales effort to win that bid was an upbeat five-minute video touting the city and its accomplishments over the years, from civil rights to the 1996 Olympics. ""We are a booming, vital, diverse American city where the American dream is being realized each and every day."" narrator and former Atlanta Mayor Andrew Young says at one point. But it was another claim that caught our attention. ""Our population has grown from about 1 million in the 1970s to almost 7 million today,"" Young says. Seven million souls residing in our fair city, or metro area or the megalopolis generically referred to as the ATL? It seemed a bit inflated to PolitiFact. We decided to check it out. What should be a simple answer turned out to be a bit complicated. And the confusion centers on that age-old question: What exactly is Atlanta? Just getting the Super Bowl to show up in your town is an expensive proposition, but one that backers contend will pay huge dividends in prestige and actual dollars flowing into local coffers. Total value of the Atlanta bid is $46 million. About  $20 million will come from donations that have beenpledged by two dozen Atlanta businesses. An additional $16 million from a portion of the Atlanta hotel-motel tax that is designated for major events. And $10 million is the estimated value to the National Football League of a sales-tax exemption on Super Bowl tickets that the Georgia Legislature passed this year. The video was funded by the Atlanta Sports Council, a branch of the Metro Atlanta Chamber and a major force in landing the Super Bowl. Sports Council President Dan Corso emailed PolitiFact that the 1970 Atlanta Metropolitan Statistical Area was about 1.8 million but had climbed to 5.7 million by 2015. It is expected to increase by about 80,000 people a year. He based those numbers on census reports. ""Further, if we expand the Atlanta MSA radius to the combined statistical area (CSA), which includes Athens, we get to over 6.2 million today, and the number increases to 6.5 million if we include Columbus,"" Corso said. The Atlanta Regional Commission estimates the population of the city of Atlanta at about 431,000, while the Census estimate is 463,000. The ARC puts the core 10-county metro Atlanta population at 4.5 million and the 20-county metro region at about 5.7 million. The CSA, which includes 29 counties and the Athens area, comes in at about 6.4 million. We also contacted population experts who generally categorized the 7 million figure as a stretch. William Frey of the Brookings Institution said the current Atlanta CSA -- a very broad population measure -- is on the way to 7 million but not there yet. ""It’s below Washington DC, Dallas, Houston and Miami in the South,"" Frey emailed. ""But if it continues its recent growth pace it could approach 7 million soon after the 2020 census. The ARC, meanwhile,  estimates the 10-county metro Atlanta population will be 5.92 million in 2040. The 20-county metro area will be 7 million by 2030 and 8 million by 2040, the ARC estimates. Our ruling A video making Atlanta’s case for the 2019 Super Bowl said: ""Our population has grown from about 1 million in the 1970s to almost 7 million today."" You could make that case for the broadest possible definition of Atlanta -- if you add Columbus into the equation. But who does that? The 20-county area most people consider the broad definition of Atlanta is about 5.7 million and will not reach 7 million for another 14 years. It’s true that metro Atlanta’s population has soared since the 1970s. But it’s misleading to say the area now approaches 7 million people.

"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'Georgians for Bernie Sanders for President']","
Pro-Sanders group on target about their candidate's polling against Trump
","Georgia supporters of Bernie Sanders are vastly outnumbered. The Peach State is solidly red -- all statewide offices are held by Republicans. And Sanders was trounced by Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton (71 percent to 28 percent) in their March 1 primary here. But Sanders’ supporters insist there is a larger point to be made as Clinton and Sanders get ready for the June 7 California primary. Despite the fact that Clinton is well positioned to get enough delegates to take the Democratic nod, Sanders is the better choice when it comes to a head-to-head matchup with presumed GOP nominee Donald Trump, according to Sanders’ Southern backers. And they took to Facebook recently to insist that a cross section of polls backs them up. Could the group Georgians for Bernie Sanders for President be correct?  Do the polls suggest Sanders would run stronger against Trump than Clinton? PolitiFact looked at a similar statement by Sanders himself earlier this year. That fact check looked at polls from January and February. We rated it Mostly True. We reached out to the Sanders and Clinton camps for their reads on the more recent polls. Clinton’s campaign did not respond. Clinton has previously said she will win the nomination and is focusing on Trump. Warren Gunnels of the Sanders campaign provided a series of polls from Real Clear Politics that shows Sanders leading Trump by more than 10 points. Another  group of polls shows Trump and Clinton neck-and-neck. Most of the polls were conducted in mid-May. In the Clinton-Trump matchup, a recent ABC News/Washington Post poll shows Trump up by 2 points. Trump leads Clinton by 6 points in a CBS News/New York Times poll, but Clinton is up by 3 points in an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll. In the Trump-Sanders contest, a recent NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll shows Sanders up by 15 points, while a CBS News/New York Times poll shows Sanders ahead by 13 points. A Fox News poll shows Sanders ahead by 3 points. A May 9-12 poll by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution found Trump would best Clinton 45 percent to 41 percent in Georgia. But Sanders was favored over Trump by Georgia voters, 47 percent to 42 percent. The sweep of the poll numbers could have an impact on the remainder of the Democratic race, said state Sen. Vincent Fort, D-Atlanta, a Sanders delegate to the Democratic National Convention. Fort admitted that Sanders has an ""uphill battle"" against Clinton. ""It makes the argument to the superdelegates stronger,"" Fort said. ""And these polls are not outliers. It’s a convincing argument. ""Bernie Sanders has changed the Democratic Party forever."" University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato added a word of caution about reading too much into the snapshots of voters’ opinions at this stage of the contest. ""Almost all polls I've seen since Trump emerged as the presumptive nominee show a close race between Trump and Clinton but a wider margin of victory for Sanders,"" Sabato said. ""What the polls cannot show is whether this matters."" He said Sanders has received relatively little vetting by the press. Sabato added that  Republicans would like nothing better than to run against ""a self-proclaimed socialist."" ""I might have missed an ad or two, but I haven't seen a single negative TV ad run against Sanders,""  he said.  ""For Clinton and Trump, being the target of negative ads is a daily hazard."" Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta, said Sanders shows up so strongly in head-to-head polls because Trump and Clinton have such high negatives. ""General election polls don’t mean much until the conventions are over and you get to late summer or early fall,"" Swint said. ""A lot of voters don’t look at Sanders as a legitimate threat. It’s almost like he’s an imaginary candidate."" Our ruling. A pro-Sanders Facebook group in Georgia said polls indicate Bernie Sanders would do better than Hillary Clinton in a head-to-head battle with Donald Trump. Major polls support that contention. But it’s difficult to say what the polls mean at this stage of the election cycle, when Sanders -- a relative unknown on the national stage -- is theoretically pitted against two well-known personalities, each with substantial baggage. That’s important context when looking at the numbers.

"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Does Obamacare really ban incentives for healthy living?
","The health care overhaul known as ""Obamacare"" is as complex as it is far-reaching, so it’s hardly a surprise that arguments over what the law requires or prohibits are lingering years after it took effect. U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan drifted into those murky waters in an April 27, 2016, town hall meeting, asserting healthy people can’t be rewarded for their lifestyle under President Barack Obama’s landmark legislation. Ryan framed his criticism around a comparison to a hypothetical neighbor. ""I’m 46, I stay in shape, I don’t smoke, I have a couple Miller Lites now and then, but I stay healthy, I work on it,"" Ryan said during the meeting at the Georgetown University Institute of Politics and Public Service. ""My next-door neighbor could be (the) same demographic, same age, he could drink a case of beer each night, two steaks, you know, not run, be 100 pounds overweight."" Then the claim about Obamacare: ""Under the law, you can’t reward a person for better behavior. You can’t have incentives to be healthier. That makes no sense."" Does Obamacare (officially the Affordable Care Act), really prohibit incentives that would charge less to healthier people? ""Like Bill Clinton would say, it depends on what ‘you’ means,"" said Soeren Mattke, managing director of Health Advisory Services for the nonpartisan Rand Corp. think tank. A tale of two interpretations Indeed, insurance companies under the Affordable Care Act cannot require different rates based on a person’s health and lifestyle. The HealthCare.gov website even expressly states companies ""can’t take your current health or medical history into account"" when setting premiums. The one caveat lies in the definition of health history. The ACA allows five factors to be considered in setting premiums: location, age, plan category, whether dependents are covered and tobacco use. Tobacco use could fall into the health ""behavior"" category Ryan referenced, though smoking wasn’t among the unhealthy vices he laid out for the hypothetical neighbor. But Ryan’s claim doesn’t specify insurance companies. And if the ""you"" is interpreted as referring also to employers — that’s how many of the experts we consulted read it — the claim gets dicier.   ""The Affordable Care Act allows employers to vary premiums by up to 30 percent to be able to reward employees not only for participating in wellness programs but to achieve specific metrics of health,"" said Meena Seshamani, director of the Office of Health Reform at the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The law even increased the maximum reward for involvement in a wellness program from 20 percent to 30 percent of the premium, also boosting the max to 50 percent for those in a smoking cessation program. Some 49 percent of Americans are insured through their employer, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. But not all employers have such programs, and then only a portion tie in financial incentives. Kaiser’s 2014 employer survey found 74 percent of firms offering health insurance have some kind of wellness program. Among those with programs, 36 percent of large firms and 18 percent of small firms offer financial incentives for participation. Ryan’s office didn’t respond to our inquiries seeking clarity on who he was referencing or evidence to support his statement. Wellness programs in dispute Despite the Affordable Care Act language, wellness programs remain a gray area of health care law — and a moving target. The U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has sued some companies over wellness programs they believed went too far with incentives or disincentives. Wellness programs are typically a combination of screening activities (questionnaires and/or clinical tests) and interventions to specifically address risks such as weight, smoking, fitness and drug use. One such case stemmed from the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin, where the EEOC alleged Flambeau, Inc., a plastics manufacturer based in Baraboo, violated the Americans with Disabilities Act by requiring employees to participate in a wellness program in order to get company health insurance. Judge Barbara Crabb dismissed the case in December 2015, however, agreeing with the company that the program fell under an exception allowing for activities related to administering an insurance plan. The EEOC is appealing the ruling, even as it issued a new rule in mid-May attempting to clarify how wellness programs can comply with the ACA, the disabilities act and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). This and similar EEOC lawsuits elsewhere are making employers hesitant to implement wellness plans that require certain benchmarks, said Tom Miller, resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute think tank. ""It’s one thing to participate and be rewarded for it, it’s another set of hurdles if you start requiring people to succeed at achieving certain goals,"" Miller said. ""It doesn’t mean you can’t do it, but there’s a lot of smoke in the air that discourages employers from going that far as a general rule."" Our rating Ryan said, ""Under (Obamacare), you can’t reward a person for better behavior. You can’t have incentives to be healthier."" Ryan is largely on point if the ""you"" refers only to insurance companies, but there’s nothing in the context to justify such a narrow interpretation. The claim was broad and implied a ban on incentives. That’s not the case. Wellness programs, while not available to everyone, are specifically authorized by the Affordable Care Act as a means for employers to raise or lower premiums by up to 30 percent based on employees’ health-related behavior.

Hillary Clinton repeats Half True claim economy does better with Democrat in White House
"," Does the nation’s economy do better when a Republican or Democrat is in the Oval Office? In her recent campaign stop in Sacramento, Hillary Clinton declared Democrats have the magic touch. ""It is a fact that the economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House,"" Clinton said on June 5, 2016, speaking at Sacramento City College during her final push in the California primary. It’s similar to a statement the likely Democratic presidential nominee made on March 21, 2016 in Phoenix, when she said: ""The economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House."" PolitiFact Arizona checked out that claim and rated it Half True. Here’s what they reported: The Clinton family love these comparisons, by the way. In 2015, PolitiFact ruled Mostly True claims from Hillary Clinton a claim that, ""Under Republicans, recessions happen four times as frequently as under Democrats,"" and another that, ""The stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House."" At the 2012 Democratic National Convention, former President Bill Clinton had this statement rated True: ""Since 1961 … our private economy has produced 66 million private-sector jobs. So what's the jobs score? Republicans 24 million, Democrats 42 (million)."" The score, however, isn’t as good for this particular Clinton claim.  Hillary Clinton speaks at a rally, Monday, June 6, 2016, in Lynwood, Calif.  Other factors involved Clinton’s Arizona spokesman, Tim Hogan, pointed us to a July 2014 study on the topic from Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. The study concludes that Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947, when the data was first tracked. However, the economists point out that there are other factors, such as better oil prices and international conditions, that could be driving these better numbers for Democratic presidents. In short, Democrats occupying the Oval Office tend to have a little better luck. Experts we spoke with largely held the same views. Harvard University government professor Jeffrey Frankel said the statistics, from GDP to the unemployment rate, are striking, but noted that the president does not have ""all that control."" ""That doesn’t prove what the cause is,"" Frankel said. Christian Weller, a public policy professor at the University of Massachusetts Boston, did his own math on the GDP data since 1947. He found that the economy, through the last quarter of 2015 and after inflation, grew 3.8 percent under Democrats and 2.4 percent under Republicans. For President Barack Obama, the growth rate in his first term was 1.8 percent. His current growth rate is 2 percent, but that’s still higher than his predecessor, George W. Bush. And his second term hasn’t ended yet. Based on estimates, Weller said Obama should hit the 2.4 percent Republican average. Still, Ronald Reagan’s 3.4 percent growth rate is well ahead of the economy right now under Obama. ""Other than Obama, every Democrat had a faster growth rate, even (Jimmy) Carter had a slightly higher growth rate than Reagan,"" Weller said. ""This is one of the safest talking points for a Democratic contender."" However, the asterisks bother Arizona State University presidential historian Brooks Simpson. ""Secretary Clinton is not exactly telling the whole truth,’"" Simpson said. Simpson referenced Bill Clinton’s administration, noting that he benefited from some of the economic policies of his predecessor, Republican George H.W. Bush. A 2011 report from the right-leaning Heritage Foundation notes that the economy was already in its ""22nd month of expansion"" when Bill Clinton took office in January 1993. We asked the Clinton campaign for a response. A spokesman pointed PolitiFact California to previous fact checks on the topic, including PolitiFact Arizona’s. The spokesman also pointed to a blog by the Washington Post that says Clinton was right on the numbers but questions whether Democrats were responsible for the better economic times or ""just got lucky."" Our ruling Hillary Clinton said in Sacramento, ""It is a fact that the economy does better when we have a Democrat in the White House."" It’s similar to her March statement in Phoenix that ""The economy always does better when there’s a Democrat in the White House."" Yes, Democratic presidents do have more Gross Domestic Product growth than Republicans, according to quarterly GDP data dating back to 1947. But Clinton's comments require several caveats. The current growth in the economy under Obama is lower than the Republican average. Factors such as oil prices also reflect the higher GDP growth under Democratic presidents. On top of that, comparing one period of time to another or one president to another can be problematic. We agree with PolitiFact Arizona’s findings and rate Clinton's claim in Sacramento Half True.

"['National', 'Legal Issues', 'Donald Trump']","
Trump wrongly casts California lawyers group as strongly pro-Mexican
","Presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump says U.S. District Court Judge Gonzalo Curiel is ""not treating me fairly."" Curiel ruled that the public can see internal papers from the now defunct Trump University. Trump’s critics and reporters have pounced on the documents. They’ve pointed to examples of a calculated effort to target people who could ill-afford expensive training sessions and had little chance of profiting from them. But for Trump, the bad press stems from a bad legal decision that has more to do with his immigration policies than the merits of a lawsuit. He said it is ""just common sense"" that Curiel’s ties to Mexico explain his ruling. Curiel, born and raised in Indiana, had parents who were naturalized U.S. citizens from Mexico. CBS News host John Dickerson pressed Trump as to what his parents had to do with him not ruling in Trump’s favor. ""He is a member of a club or society, very strongly pro-Mexican, which is all fine,"" Trump said on Face the Nation on June 5. ""But I say, he's got bias. I want to build a wall."" It’s a serious matter to accuse federal judges of bias solely because of their ethnic background, and top-ranking Republicans have rejected Trump’s line. Our interest though is strictly in this club that Trump referenced. Is it actually ""strongly pro-Mexican"" as he said? We reached out to the Trump campaign for details and did not hear back. The group in question is the California La Raza Lawyers Association. It dates back to 1977. The group’s immediate past president, Joel Murillo, told us that it was formed in response to stereotyping coming from judges and lawyers. ""There were judges on the bench saying people with Spanish surnames were prone to be savages,"" Murillo said. ""When we tried to integrate with the mainstream bar association, we were denied. We were marginalized. The only people who were willing to work with us were us."" Murillo says the days of stereotyping are over, and the group now focuses on the professional development of Latino lawyers and encouraging students to pursue a career in law. He called Trump’s description of the association as very strongly pro-Mexican a ""misnomer."" Murillo said most of the group’s recent work targets improving the quality of education for all students in California. The group has not been involved in the immigration debate. ""The closest was when there were beatings by police and others that offended the constitutional rights of people,"" Murillo said. ""We made suggestions of ways to ameliorate attacks on people with Spanish surnames."" Our search of the Nexis newspaper database found an episode in 2004 when the association wrote a letter calling for the cancellation of a popular Los Angeles reality television show in which illegal immigrants competed for the free services of an immigration lawyer to apply for a green card. The show ""functions as a magnet to encourage people to enter this country without documentation,"" the letter said. The group’s bylaws state, ""The purpose and goal of this association is to promote the interests of the Latino communities throughout the state and the professional interests of the membership."" That membership is now about half Latino, Murillo said, and in terms of party affiliation, ""the lawyers who belong pretty much reflect the population."" California is about 43 percent Democratic, 28 percent Republican and about 24 percent undeclared. Murillo also noted that strictly speaking, the group is focused on the Latino community, a term that is much broader than people with family roots in Mexico. The association’s website, last updated in 2013, describes a judicial committee that ""seeks to increase the number of Latinos appointed to judgeships."" Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California Davis School of Law, told us the association is ""seen as a pretty moderate group"" that’s mainly focused on civil rights. On the legal front, we found the group filed a 2012 friend of the court brief in support of Sergio Garcia, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico seeking admission to the State Bar of California. But the issue was broader than simple Hispanic solidarity. That brief was co-written by the Asian/Pacific Bar Association of Sacramento. In 2002, the San Francisco chapter joined with nine other organizations to support an appeal on the grounds that racism tainted the jury selection process. The defendant, Stanley Williams, did not have a Spanish surname, and the other organizations included the NAACP, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference of Los Angeles, the Asian Law Caucus and the American Civil Liberties Union of Northern California. We asked Johnson if including ""La Raza"" in the group’s name carried a special meaning. He said the term is ""sort of a product of its times"" that emerged from the Chicano civil rights movement of the 1960s. ""The founders and presidents have not been remarkable, in a political sense,"" Johnson said. The group is often confused with the National Council of La Raza, an advocacy group often criticized by conservatives. Aside from a similarity in their names, the only tie we found was a link to the National Council of La Raza on the lawyers association website. But that list of links also includes the National Latino Police Officers Association and the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. The conservative website Redstate posted an op-ed rebuking Trump’s use of the California lawyers group as proof of Judge Curiel’s political motives. The writer, Leon Wolf, called the effort to disparage the association ""dishonest."" ""As far as I can tell, they appear to be a pretty garden variety special interest lawyers association,"" Wolf wrote. ""Every state has these chapters for Hispanic lawyers, black lawyers, women lawyers, Mormon lawyers, Christian lawyers, Jewish lawyers -- you name it, there is a lawyer association for it in every state."" Our ruling Trump said Curiel belonged to a group that is very strongly pro-Mexican. The California La Raza Lawyers Association does advance the interests of the Latino legal community and works on issues that matter in Latino communities more broadly.  However, it has stayed on the sidelines in the immigration debate. The one exception is one letter from a dozen years ago which objected to a television show on the grounds that the program encouraged people to enter the country without documentation. The group’s rare court filings focus on civil rights in general. Trump’s statement is accurate only in the sense that the association’s mission aims to support Latinos, but even that is flawed because he said the group was pro-Mexican and the Latino designation reaches a wider set of people. The claim ignores critical facts that would give a very different impression.

"['National', 'Supreme Court', 'Mitch McConnell']","
McConnell mostly right about Obama selling previous Supreme Court nominees as moderate
","Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., says that just because President Barack Obama says his Supreme Court nominations are moderate doesn’t mean they are. McConnell, who appeared on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, discussed Merrick Garland, Obama’s nomination for the vacant Supreme Court seat May 31. Co-host Mika Brzezinski characterized Garland as a middle of the road nomination, but McConnell quickly clarified that this was not the case, adding that just because Obama calls someone a moderate doesn’t make it true.  McConnell has joined other Senate Republicans in pledging not to consider Garland’s nomination in an election year. Obama said the same things about previous nominees Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, McConnell told Brzezinski. Obama ""called Kagan a moderate. He called Sotomayor a moderate,"" McConnell said. Is that true? Yes, and no. Obama never used those words to describe his two previous Supreme Court nominees. But he has talked up their bipartisan credentials. McConnell spokesman Don Stewart referenced Obama’s nomination speeches for Sotomayor and Kagan as evidence. Stewart said that Obama described Sotomayor as having bipartisan support during his remarks following the announcement of her nomination in 2009. ""It's a measure of her qualities and her qualifications that Judge Sotomayor was nominated to the U.S. District Court by a Republican President, George H.W. Bush, and promoted to the Federal Court of Appeals by a Democrat, Bill Clinton,"" Obama said. Stewart also pointed to Obama’s remarks from Elena Kagan’s nomination speech that characterized her as a ""consensus builder"" and which made clear her openness to viewpoints of all kinds. Each instance, Obama characterizes the Supreme Court appointees as open minded. But he never used the word moderate. What’s the difference? Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that just because Obama didn’t use the word moderate doesn’t make McConnell wrong. ""The point is that Obama was selling his nominees as in the legal mainstream, of good temperament, and generally suitable for high judicial office,"" Shapiro said. ""That’s not uncommon. Indeed, it’s good PR."" Shapiro also said that there are some common themes among the characterization of the presidents’ nominations for Supreme Court. ""Consensus building and respect by all sides seems to be, on this unscientific canvas, a fairly common characteristic,"" Shapiro said. For example, President George W. Bush described nominees Samuel Alito and Harriet Miers in a similar way. ""(Alito) is scholarly, fair-minded and principled. ... In the performance of his duties, Judge Alito has gained the respect of his colleagues and attorneys for his brilliance and decency. He's won admirers across the political spectrum,"" Bush said of Alito. ""Harriet has built a reputation for fairness and integrity,"" Bush said. President Bill Clinton did the same. Speaking of nominee Stephen Breyer, Clinton said, ""He has proven that he can build an effective consensus and get people of diverse views to work together for justice's sake."" On Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Clinton said: ""I believe that in the years ahead she will be able to be a force for consensus-building on the Supreme Court . . . Judge Ginsburg has also proven herself to be a healer, what attorneys call a moderate."" Russell Wheeler, a judicial expert with the Brookings Institution said moderate is a ""comparative term,"" so its validity depends on who you're comparing the person too. ""When Sotomayor was on the court of appeals, there were other court of appeals judges across the country who were more liberal than she was, and by the same token, law professors and deans more liberal than Kagan when Obama nominated her,"" Wheeler said. ""I presume that’s the context of what Obama was supposed to have said, according to McConnell."" Our ruling McConnell said Obama has called his last two Supreme Court appointments ""moderate."" The president didn’t use that word, but he did use language that characterizes them as liked by both sides.

Pat Toomey’s beef with Supreme Court pick Merrick Garland for freeing ‘extremists'
","U.S. Senator Pat Toomey has doubts about Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland -- particularly regarding a ruling that set free prisoners from Guantánamo Bay. Garland ""authored an opinion that resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists the State Department had designated as terrorists,"" Republican Toomey wrote in an April op-ed for PennLive titled, ""Here's why I'm opposing Merrick Garland's Supreme Court nomination."" Look closely: Toomey’s statement combines two court rulings, Garland’s and a later decision. The first, decided by a three-judge panel and indeed authored by Garland, ordered the release of one detainee, not 17.
  Uighurs in China Toomey is not referring to a typical Guantánamo case. The story begins with social unrest in China, and the status of the Uighurs. Uighurs (pronounced wee-gurs) are a Muslim ethnic minority primarily from the northwestern province of Xinjiang. After alleged discrimination and violent clashes, the 22 Uighurs fled China for the Afghan mountains, and fled again after airstrikes reached their settlement after 9/11. They were captured and sent to Gitmo in 2002. Many had been captured in Pakistan, close to the Afghan border, by bounty hunters who sold them to the United States for $5,000 each. Why would a Uighur militant be a part of Al Qaida? In the 2013 report ""Terrorism in China,"" University of Virginia Professor Philip B.K. Potter traces it to ""China’s ongoing security crackdown in Xinjiang [forcing] the most militant Uyghur separatists into volatile neighboring countries, such as Pakistan, where they are forging strategic alliances with, and even leading, jihadist factions affiliated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban."" So, as the executive branch pushed for Guantánamo’s closure, the case of the Uighurs and their possible ties to terrorism took center stage. Five Uighurs were cleared and released in 2006, resettling in Albania. Seventeen remained in custody. Which brings us Garland and the 2008 opinion that Toomey is referencing.   What made the government back down Really, the three-judge panel on which Garland sat only released one Uighur: Huzaifa Parhat. Parhat told the FBI, per court documents, that he left China to escape harsh discrimination. His people suffered ""harassment, forced abortions for more than two children, high taxes, the taking away of land, and the banishing of educated people to remote areas,"" he said. He was one of the Uighurs who had basic gun training from the East Turkistan Islamic Movement (or ETIM; Turkistan is a name some Uighur independentists use for their homelands), learning how to take apart and clean guns. Much of the evidence that the government provided came from his own interviews. Parhat identified Hassan Maksum and Abdul Haq, as leaders at the camp; both men were ETIM fighters and Al Qaida members. In court, Parhat argued that just because some people in the camp were members of ETIM, it didn’t mean that the whole camp was. Garland, in his opinion, noted that the intelligence didn’t seem certain. ""The documents repeatedly describe those activities and relationships as having ‘reportedly’ occurred, as being ‘said to’ or ‘reported to’ have happened, and as things that ‘may’ be true or are ‘suspected of’ having taken place,"" he wrote. ""But in virtually every instance, the documents do not say who ‘reported’ or ‘said’ or ‘suspected’ those things."" Further: ""To be clear, we do not suggest that hearsay evidence is never reliable -- only that it must be presented in a form, or with sufficient additional information, that permits the Tribunal and court to assess its reliability."" The three-judge panel unanimously found  that the government didn’t have enough evidence to prove that Parhat was Taliban-affiliated or an enemy of the United States. The government conceded that it would not argue differently for the remaining detainees. The D.C. Federal District Court, Ricardo Urbina, ordered their release later that year. Urbina also ordered them transferred to the United States, but a federal circuit court panel later blocked this move. Federal law bans transferring Guantanamo detainees to American soil. Because the United States has a non-refoulement policy that prohibits sending refugees to countries where they would be in danger, the detainees could not be sent back to China. So these men were resettled in nations like Palau, Switzerland and Bermuda. The last Uighur detainees left Guantánamo for Slovakia as 2013 came to a close.   What do experts think? It’s worth noting that the government pointed to other evidence against the Uighurs that remains classified. But Toomey isn’t basing his statement on classified documents. What’s unclassified is ""ample"" enough, according to his spokeswoman, to substantiate the claim. Out of the unclassified documents, the primary sources are the Uighurs themselves. Many of the Uighur 17 admitted that they received basic gun training, but none said they had Al Qaida ties. Many said they were fighting -- but for their independence, not in global jihad or with efforts to hurt Americans. In 2003, according to the Washington Post, the Pentagon had already considered five of the Uighurs innocent (the same five who were relocated to Albania three years later) and another 10 ""low-risk,"" approving 15 for release. The report quotes a State Department official calling the Uighurs’ case ""unfortunate."" Some experts believe the Uighurs’ detainment was likely a mistake. Benjamin Wittes, a governance studies researcher at the Brookings Institution, told PBS NewsHour that he considered this a  case of wrong place, wrong time. ""These are actually not people who have a problem with the United States,"" said Wittes. ""These are people who have a problem with the government of China and whose marriage of convenience with the Taliban is really just a convenience thing. It’s not part of any global jihad."" While Thomas Joscelyn, senior editor at the Long War Journal, doesn’t believe the Uighur detainees were high-threat, he doesn’t see them as harmless and disagrees with Wittes. ""It’s what we call the Forrest Gump story,"" he said. ""Where they happened upon these places that are Al Qaida-affiliated by accident. ... It strains credulity that would accidentally find their way to the Tora Bora Mountains, a known Al Qaida stronghold, jihadist country at that time."" Almerindo Eduardo Ojeda, director of the Center for the Study of Human Rights in the Americas, calls the detainees ""mostly independentists that happened to be Muslims."" Labeling them terrorists on ""grounds that [the government] cannot reveal... is particularly insidious, as there is a definite interest in large areas of the government to inflate the claims. At an enormous cost to the detainees,"" he emailed. ""For GTMO prisoners to be released,"" Ojeda asked, ""They have to be cleared by all relevant intelligence agencies. What does Pat Toomey know that they don't?""   Our ruling Toomey wrote that Garland ""authored an opinion that resulted in the release of 17 Guantanamo Bay prisoners who were part of a group of violent Islamist extremists the State Department had designated as terrorists."" Toomey’s claim is misleading. We have no definitive proof that the Uighur detainees engaged in terrorist acts or were ""violent Islamist extremists."" They were an oppressed ethnic minority in China and may have been caught up in events without endorsing terrorism. The courts released them because the government’s case against them seemed dubious. We rule the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/jun/07/pat-toomey/pat-toomeys-beef-supreme-court-pick-merrick-garlan/

In shot at Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton is correct about tariffs' role in Great Depression
","During a speech in which she attacked Donald Trump’s foreign policy ideas as ""dangerously incoherent,"" Hillary Clinton reached back almost nine decades to make a Great Depression-era analogy. Clinton said she understood voters’ concerns about the negative impacts of free trade agreements -- a big driver of Trump’s electoral success so far. Still, pursuing large tariffs against such trading partners as China and Mexico -- as Trump has suggested -- would be dangerously misguided, Clinton argued. ""I understand a lot of Americans have concerns about our trade agreements,"" Clinton said. ""I do, too. But a trade war is something very different. We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful."" We wondered whether there is widespread support among historians and economists for the idea that raising tariffs and enabling a trade war ""made the Great Depression longer and more painful."" When we asked the Clinton campaign for its evidence, they pointed us to a 2013 speech by Federal Reserve Board chairman Ben Bernanke, whose expertise as an academic was the Great Depression. But we found additional support among other experts who have studied the period. The Smoot-Hawley tariffs If you’re a fan of the 1980s teen flick Ferris Bueller’s Day Off, you’ve already gotten a cheat sheet on what our research found. In a career-making scene, Ben Stein played a high school teacher explaining the causes of the Great Depression to a roomful of listless students. (It was actually a top-of-the-head riff by Stein, a trained economist.) Here’s the part that’s relevant to our fact-check (watch it here): ""In 1930, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives, in an effort to alleviate the effects of the... Anyone? Anyone?... the Great Depression, passed the... Anyone? Anyone? The tariff bill? The Hawley-Smoot Tariff Act? Which, anyone? Raised or lowered?... raised tariffs, in an effort to collect more revenue for the federal government. Did it work? Anyone? Anyone know the effects? It did not work, and the United States sank deeper into the Great Depression."" Stein’s monologue pretty much tracks with what Clinton said: The United States imposed tariffs, they backfired, and the Depression got even worse. Specifically, the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 -- sponsored by Sen. Reid Smoot, R-Utah, and Rep. Willis Hawley, R-Ore. -- raised tariffs on manufactured foreign imports to 40 percent in some cases, the highest in U.S. history. It also extended tariff protection to some agricultural products. These moves, in turn, led other countries to retaliate with high tariffs of their own. So how accurate is the Clinton-Stein version of events? Several economists and historians who studied the period said that it’s quite accurate. Expert opinions Douglas Irwin, a Dartmouth College economist and author of Peddling Protectionism: Smoot-Hawley and the Great Depression and Trade Policy Disaster: Lessons from the 1930s, said Clinton was ""astute"" in distinguishing between putting the brakes on future expansion of free trade, as Trump and Clinton have both at times advocated, and actually reversing established trade agreements by imposing new tariffs, as only Trump has suggested. ""Protectionism did not cause the Great Depression, but I think saying it made it longer and more painful is actually quite well put,"" Irwin said. Irwin said there was ""no real reason"" to impose such tariffs, and that it was mainly done for ""domestic political reasons."" In fact, President Herbert Hoover is said to have signed the law only reluctantly, over the spirited objections of many economists. After the tariffs were enacted, other countries, including Canada, retaliated against the United States by establishing a preferential trade bloc with Great Britain and other countries, thus hurting U.S. exports. ""Other countries also used trade restrictions and protectionism as beggar-thy-neighbor policies to help their domestic economies during the worldwide slump,"" Irwin said. The problem, Irwin said, was that ""if every country tries this strategy, everyone worse off since one country's imports are another country's exports. World trade reduced significantly, and since trade barriers are easy to impose and hard to relax, the problem festered for some time."" Indeed, it took until 1933 for this downward spiral to ease. That’s when President Franklin D. Roosevelt -- a committed opponent of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs -- took office. Roosevelt ""came in on the traditional Democratic platform that tariffs should fall, and his Secretary of State, Cordell Hull, was practically a one-issue man on the subject of freeing up trade,"" said Eric Rauchway, a historian at the University of California-Davis and author of The Money Makers: How Roosevelt and Keynes Ended the Depression, Defeated Fascism, and Secured a Prosperous Peace. ""The Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1934 started the U.S. down that road, giving the executive power to negotiate agreements on tariffs. Hull used this power to bring down trade barriers."" As a side effect, the skirmishes over trade also frayed relations between former allies and may have contributed to the tensions that led to World War II, or at the very least complicated the Allies’ efforts to respond to the threat from Germany and Japan. This isn’t to say that there is unanimity among scholars about the precise role of Smoot-Hawley in worsening the Great Depression.  ""Economists today debate the tariffs’ effect on the Great Depression -- some feel it substantially worsened the downturn, while others think its negative effect was small,"" said Andrew Wender Cohen, a Syracuse University historian and author of Contraband: Smuggling and the Birth of the American Century. For instance, Robert S. McElvaine, a Millsaps College historian and author of The Great Depression: America 1929-1941, said the spotlighting of Smoot-Hawley has been articulated most aggressively by conservative, free-market advocates because it takes the focus off 1920s-era tax cuts and general income inequality during that decade. Still, McElvaine agreed that, even if the tariffs weren’t the biggest factor for prolonging the Great Depression -- he points instead to insufficiently effective New Deal policies under Roosevelt -- the tariffs did have an effect, and it was clearly negative. It’s also tricky to isolate causes of economic turmoil because they were tightly interwoven, experts said. ""It's entirely possible that international trade would have dwindled even if government had not resorted to protectionism,"" said John E. Moser, an Ashland University historian and author of Global Great Depression and the Coming of World War II. ""However, most economists agree that protectionism at the very least did not help, and likely prolonged the Depression."" Alonzo L. Hamby, an Ohio University historian and author of For the Survival of Democracy: Franklin Roosevelt and the World Crisis of the 1930s, agreed. ""I think Clinton has a strong case for the proposition that it hurt an economy that already had moved into a deep recession,"" Hamby said. Our ruling Clinton said, ""A trade war is something very different (than curbing new trade agreements). We went down that road in the 1930s. It made the Great Depression longer and more painful."" Numerous experts we checked with said the Smoot-Hawley tariffs and the resulting trade war weren’t the only factor to worsen the Great Depression. However, they agreed that the trade war undeniably had a negative impact. Clinton took care not to overplay this argument in her speech, so we rate her statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/70e79ee2-c021-4885-9526-ce33d8442f16",/factchecks/2016/jun/06/hillary-clinton/shot-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-correct-about-ta/

Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump argued U.S. should 'encourage' Japan to get nuclear weapons
","During a high-profile foreign policy speech, Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton repeated a series of past statements by Donald Trump to show that her Republican rival poses risks for international relations. One of these past statements by Trump involved whether Japan should become a nuclear-armed state. ""It's no small thing when he suggests that America should withdraw our military support for Japan, encourage them to get nuclear weapons,"" Clinton said in her June 2, 2016, speech.  Is Clinton correct that Trump encouraged Japan to get nuclear weapons? What Trump has said As we noted earlier, Clinton’s evidence includes interviews and comments Trump has made on the campaign trail. When Trump sat for a March 26 interview with the New York Times, he was asked directly, ""Would you object if (Japan) got their own nuclear arsenal, given the threat that they face from North Korea and China?"" Trump responded in part, ""There’ll be a point at which we’re just not going to be able to do it anymore. Now, does that mean nuclear? It could mean nuclear. It’s a very scary nuclear world. Biggest problem, to me, in the world, is nuclear, and proliferation. At the same time, you know, we’re a country that doesn’t have money."" Let’s set aside Trump’s internal inconsistency -- saying that Japan might need nuclear weapons, and then, just seconds later, saying that the world’s ""biggest problem"" is nuclear proliferation. If you read his words closely, Trump didn’t quite say he was encouraging Japan to get nuclear weapons, but he did go right up to the line. He was leaving the option on the table. Having seen Trump’s comments to the New York Times, CNN’s Anderson Cooper asked him about it in a CNN town hall in Milwaukee on March 29. Answering Cooper’s question about breaking with Japan’s non-nuclear stance, Trump said, ""At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea."" In fact, during the town hall, Cooper gave Trump multiple opportunities to back off his suggestion that Japan may need nuclear weapons, but Trump never did. He said, in succession, ""maybe it's going to have to be time to change,"" ""at some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off,"" ""it's going to happen, anyway,"" and ""wouldn't you rather in a certain sense have Japan have nuclear weapons?"" That may not fit the strict definition of encouraging Japan to get nuclear weapons, but again, it’s very close. Finally, Trump said something similar on the April 3 edition of Fox News Sunday, when host Chris Wallace pressed Trump on his past comments. After Wallace asked whether Trump wanted to see a nuclear arms race on the Korean peninsula, Trump said, ""It's not like, gee whiz, nobody has them. So, North Korea has nukes. Japan has a problem with that. I mean, they have a big problem with that. Maybe they would in fact be better off if they defend themselves from North Korea."" Wallace interjected, ""With nukes?"" Trump responded, ""Maybe they would be better off -- including with nukes, yes, including with nukes."" How unusual this position is We also asked nuclear policy experts whether Trump’s stated position -- not specifically encouraging Japan to get nuclear weapons, but saying he would be open to it -- was an unusual view, as Clinton suggested. They said it was. ""The prevailing, bipartisan and fairly settled academic judgment has been that the risk of loose nukes or accidental nuclear war means that every additional nuclear weapon is a potential cataclysm waiting to happen,"" said Richard Nephew, a fellow with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. ""I'm not aware of anyone that I'd deem to be a serious policy proponent or thinker who has seriously advocated this in a while."" The last major figure Nephew could think of is Kenneth Waltz, an international relations scholar who articulated a ""realist"" view -- discussed in this 1981 paper -- that said the wide spread of nuclear weapons would create such risks to using them that no country ever would. However, ""by the 1960s, most folks had decided that was a horrible idea,"" Nephew said. ""You'd be hard pressed to find anyone saying that since the end of the Cold War."" Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, agreed. The statements were so out of the mainstream that ""our allies in Japan and the rest of Asia are already alarmed by those statements. Mr. Trump’s suggestion that a nuclear-armed Japan would make the United States or Japan safer is radical and highly dangerous, and is without precedent for a major party presidential nominee."" Our ruling Clinton took Trump to task for saying that the United States should ""encourage"" Japan to get nuclear weapons. Trump used vague and contradictory language, but it’s a fair reading to say his words amounted to encouragement. On more than one occasion, Trump publicly said that Japan, and the United States, might be better off if Japan had nuclear weapons, and he declined multiple attempts by interviewers to backtrack from that view.

Carlos Lopez-Cantera says he slashed his office budget
","In the crowded Republican primary to replace U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera says he has evidence that he takes care of taxpayers’ wallets. ""I've cut the budget of the office by more than half, reduced the staff,"" he said in an interview on the April 30 Money, Power, Politics show on Fox 13 in Tampa. ""I'm the only lieutenant governor to not take a security detail."" He has declined his security detail, breaking from his predecessors. Lopez-Cantera has also cut the budget and reduced staff positions. But he is leaving out some context. The only official role of the lieutenant governor is to replace the governor if he leaves offices or dies. What he or she does in the meantime varies with the governor and his or her vision. Lopez-Cantera is not as active or in the public eye as much as some of his predecessors, rarely posting official events on his public calendar and not tasked with any special assignments from Gov. Rick Scott. Scott’s first lieutenant governor, Jennifer Carroll, resigned in March 2013 after she was questioned by law enforcement about her ties to a charity group that was the subject of probes. (She was not charged with wrongdoing.) She chaired a task force about Florida’s Stand Your Ground law after Trayvon Martin’s death and chaired the Space Florida Board. Scott tapped Lopez-Cantera, a former state legislator and Miami-Dade property appraiser, to replace her almost a year later in February 2014. Let’s see how the budget changed. Reducing budget and staff The lieutenant governor’s budget has ranged from about $245,000 to $540,000 in recent years. Lopez-Cantera’s office does not have its own budget like other state agencies. Scott proposes a budget that includes the lieutenant governor. It is then up to the Legislature to pass a budget, which Scott then signs into law. The amount of money below includes the $125,000 annual salary for the lieutenant governor. Year Allotment Expenditure 2009-10 $439,646 $433,006 2010-11 $540,440 $537,664 2011-12 $504,169 $587,389 2012-13 $509,806 $471,091 2013-14 $245,016 $156,435 2014-15 $485,160 $415,522 2015-16 $240,693 $242,875 2016-17 Not announced yet NA So for a few years the lieutenant governor’s budget was about $500,000. The it was chopped in half to $245,016 for the 2013-14 budget year that started July 1, 2013, a few months after Carroll resigned. It’s no surprise that the allocation dropped since the office was vacant. Since Lopez-Cantera took office in February 2014, it is also not surprising the allotment nearly doubled to $485,160 for the 2014-15 budget year. The next year, the budget allotment dropped to slightly less than when Lopez-Cantera started to $240,693 — a 50 percent decrease. Most of the budget is staff salaries.

It's also worth keeping in mind that Lopez-Cantera has access to the full weight of the governor's office for his needs, including the press office, legislative aides and budget analysts. Under Carroll, there were five employees in the lieutenant governor’s office each year, which included a chief of staff and assistants. When Lopez-Cantera started in February 2014, there were four staffers. Then the number dropped to two, and now he just has one employee whose title is a special assistant. The governor’s office said no one was laid off. We asked if that meant that Lopez-Cantera cut empty positions or shifted jobs to the governor’s office or elsewhere. The governor’s office didn’t answer that question. Our ruling Lopez-Cantera said, ""I've cut the budget of the office by more than half."" He omits some context about how his office budget works. Scott recommends a budget, which is then approved by the Legislature. Lopez-Cantera's own resources may be limited, but he downplays the access he has to Scott's vast governing operation for assistance. Months after Lopez-Cantera started, the budget rose by roughly double to bring it more in line to where it was when a lieutenant governor in the office. But after that increase, the budget allotment dropped the next year to slightly less than when Lopez-Cantera started to $240,693 — a 50 percent decrease. The budget largely pays for Lopez-Cantera’s salary as well as a special assistant.

Levar Stoney wrongly traces Virginia felon voting ban to Jim Crow era
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe was quick to credit Richmond mayoral candidate Levar Stoney for playing a key role in his decision to restore voting rights to more than 200,000 felons in Virginia who have served their time. Until mid-April, Stoney was McAuliffe’s secretary of the commonwealth. The office oversees gubernatorial appointments and the restoration of rights to felons. Stoney, whose father once had lost his voting privileges, urged McAuliffe to issue a blanket restoration of rights to former inmates instead of continuing the process of considering each case individually. He stood beside McAuliffe and was allowed to speak at an April 22 ceremony on the Capitol steps at which the governor signed the restoration order. Both he and McAuliffe said the policy of making it hard for felons to regain their rights harks back to Virginia’s days of excluding black voters. Stoney added a detail during a recent radio interview on ""The Jack Gravely Show,"" when he was asked whether the restoration was a ""Democratic move"" to help him win the mayorship this year and presumptive presidential nominee Hillary Clinton carry the state in November. ""Well, when people tell me that, it’s laughable,"" he replied, ""because there are some people who would rather stand up for a Jim Crow-era law, a civil rights era law, instead of actually think about the 224,000 people now who actually have a voice in the process."" Stoney made a similar claim in a May 2 tweet in which he lamented a Republican legal challenge to the blanket restoration. ""We must move past these Jim Crow-era laws and look forward to engaging the citizens of Richmond in civic participation,"" he wrote. We wondered whether Virginia’s policy of banning felons from the ballot box really does spring from the Jim Crow era. Let’s go back in time. Black men were widely given the right to vote by the 15th Amendment, ratified in 1870 - five years after the Civil War ended. By the late 1870s, Southern states began passing so-called Jim Crow laws to promote segregation and to sidestep the amendment with laws that made it all but impossible for blacks to vote. The Jim Crow era - marked by poll taxes, literacy tests to vote, segregated schools and public facilities - lasted until the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. In 1902, the General Assembly adopted a new state constitution that had all of those restrictions. It also included a section that banned persons convicted ""of any felony"" from voting. Stoney cites the 1902 constitution as proof that the ban on felons voting is a Jim Crow-era law. He also cites a quote by Carter Glass, a delegate in the 1902 deliberations who went on to become a U.S. senator and U.S. secretary of the Treasury. Glass approvingly said that all of the voting restrictions will combine to ""eliminate the darkey as a political factor in this state, so that in no single county … will there be the least concern felt for the complete supremacy of the white race in the affairs of government."" But again, Carter was talking about the effect of all the voting restraints. He did not specifically mention the felon ban. Records trace that law back to a state constitution adopted in 1830 - decades before the Jim Crow era.  Article III, Section 14 of the document denied ""the right of suffrage"" to ""any person convicted of any infamous offense."" This is important, because the 1830 constitution also limited the right to vote to white men. Blacks initially were unaffected by the felon ban, because they couldn’t vote. Only white, male felons lost the right. The same conditions applied in redrafts of the constitution in 1850 and 1864. Virginia Republicans, in their suit to stop McAuliffe’s blanket restoration, note that the felon ban’s onset in 1830 occurred ""long before African-Americans could vote."" But the GOP stressed that the history is not central to their suit. Republicans say McAuliffe doesn’t have authority to issue the blanket restoration and must consider giving back rights to each felon individually. Attorney General Mark R. Herring, in replying to the GOP lawsuit, did not address the history of the ban. It should be pointed out that Virginia’s current constitution - adopted in 1971, after the Jim Crow era ended - retained the ban on felon voting unless their rights had been restored by the governor. A final note: This Truth-O-Meter simply examines whether the felon ban is a Jim Crow policy. We don’t doubt an assertion that the ban, today, largely affects black voters. The Virginia Department of Corrections most recently released a racial breakdown of its prison population in mid-2014. Of almost 37,000 inmates, it found that 58.5 percent were black, 38.6 percent were white, 2.2 percent were Hispanic, and 0.7 percent were listed as ""other."" The U.S. Census Bureau estimates blacks comprised 19.7 of Virginia’s population in mid-2014. Our ruling  Stoney said Virginia’s banning of felons from voting is a ""Jim Crow-era law."" The ban was written into Virginia’s constitution in 1830, almost a half-century before the era began. Only white men could vote then, so contrary to Stoney’s assertion, the law couldn’t have been designed to keep blacks from voting. The ban was retained in redrafts of Virginia’s constitution that were adopted during and after Jim Crow days. We rate Stoney’s statement False.",/factchecks/2016/jun/06/levar-stoney/levar-stoney-wrongly-traces-virginia-felon-voting-/

Face-painted man in horned fur cap at Capitol riot supports Trump and QAnon, not antifa
","Hours after supporters of President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol, several of his allies in Congress and the media baselessly claimed anti-fascist provacateurs were to blame for the violence. Some suggested, without evidence, that the crowd backing Trump’s efforts to overturn the election was infiltrated by antifa. Antifa stands for ""anti-fascist,"" and it is not a group but a broad coalition of activists.  Others focused on specific protesters who forced their way inside the Capitol and were shown in photographs, such as a bare-chested man who wore face paint and a horned fur cap. ""These are NOT Trump supporters,"" said one Jan. 6 Facebook post. ""Antifa THUGS."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But the mysterious man in horns is not antifa-aligned. The man, Jake Angeli, supports Trump and is a well-known supporter of the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory. He goes by the moniker, ""Q Shaman,"" and he told the Arizona Republic he uses his unique outfit to stand out. Poynter reported that in December, Angeli launched an online crowdfunding campaign to fund his participation in pro-Trump events.  The Arizona Republic described him as ""a QAnon supporter who has been a fixture at Arizona right-wing political rallies over the past year."" The Associated Press reported that he was also seen in the same signature headwear at a pro-Trump rally Nov. 7 in Phoenix.  Jake Angeli speaks at a rally outside the Maricopa County Recorder's Office on Nov. 7, 2020, in Phoenix. (AP) PolitiFact’s review of Angeli’s private Facebook page showed photos and posts that indicated support for QAnon and Trump. (Followers of QAnon believe Trump is leading a fight against a global cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles.) False claims linking Angeli and other people who mobbed the Capitol to antifa took off online in the hours after the event. An NBC News analysis identified thousands of tweets that accused antifa members of ""posing"" as Trump supporters.  Angeli responded on Twitter when Lin Wood, an attorney who has filed lawsuits seeking to overturn the presidential election, posted photos of Angeli and claimed he is an antifa activist. The Daily Beast’s Will Sommer, who covers QAnon closely, highlighted the exchange. ""Mr. Wood. I am not antifa or blm,"" Angeli’s tweet said. ""I'm a Qanon & digital soldier. My name is Jake & I marched with the police & fought against BLM & ANTIFA in PHX."" There remains no credible evidence that the Trump supporters who stormed the U.S. Capitol were antifa activists. Video and photos from the scene show many people wearing and waving Trump-branded paraphernalia and flags. Trump spoke to a rally of supporters in Washington hours before the violence erupted, and he had urged them to come to the city on Jan. 6 and back his efforts to overturn the election. He encouraged the rally to march to Congress and suggested he’d join them. He did not.

No, protesters didn’t storm the Georgia and Kansas capitol buildings
","As a mob breached the U.S. Capitol in Washington D.C. on Jan. 6, when supporters of President Donald Trump gathered to protest the 2020 election results, claims of similar incidents started sprouting up elsewhere in the country.  ""Georgia and Kansas Capitol buildings have been stormed by protesters,"" one Facebook post read.   It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed.

Insider, for example, reported that ""Pro-Trump rioters reportedly attempted to storm the Georgia Capitol"" while New York magazine tweeted that in Kansas, ""protesters breached the state house."" But news reports from people in those states haven’t illustrated a scene like the one we’ve seen unfolding in the nation’s capital.

Brain Kemp is secure as well, with no issues at Cap,"" Fowler said. A spokesperson for the secretary of state told the Atlanta Journal-Constitution that they ""heard reports of threats and left immediately,"" The newspaper reported that police escorted Raffensperger and his staff out of the Capitol after ""Trump supporters attempted to enter the building.""  This followed a small, peaceful ""Stop the Steal"" rally, according to the paper.  ABC News reported that Raffensperger was escorted out ""after protestors gathered near the parking deck.""  Fox New quoted him as saying, ""We saw stuff happening at the Georgia Capitol and said, ‘We should not be around here, we should not be a spark.’"" Alyssa Pointer, a photojournalist with the Journal-Constitution, tweeted a photo of Chester Doles and said Doles, ""founder of the American Patriots USA and a former KKK leader, roams the #Georgia State Capitol building looking for the office of @GaSecofState Brad Raffensperger in #Atlanta, Wed., Jan. 6, 2021.

Here’s how we know Trump’s repeated claim of a landslide victory is wrong
","A mob breached the U.S. Capitol building on Jan. 6, forcing evacuations in both chambers of Congress and halting the Electoral College vote count — a historic insurrection against the federal government. The chaotic day started with a demonstration at the White House to promote the falsehood that President Donald Trump won the 2020 election.  For more than two months, Trump has uttered and encouraged inaccurate claims that the election was stolen from him to put Joe Biden in the White House. The claims festered on social media and found a home on television networks like Fox News, One America News and Newsmax.  In remarks to his supporters on Jan. 6, Trump doubled down on his false claim to victory. He said lawmakers were trying to ""illegally take over our country"" and encouraged people to march toward the Capitol, which they did. RELATED: A day of crisis at the US Capitol, fact-checked ""We won. We won in a landslide,"" he said during a speech on the Ellipse outside the White House. ""This was a landslide."" No, it was not a landslide. And he didn’t win. Here’s how we know that: All 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their election results, which Congress sought to finalize Jan. 6. Those results show that Biden won with 306 electoral votes, to Trump’s 232. Biden won the popular vote by about 7 million. There is no evidence that voter fraud affected that outcome.  Election officials in every state have said there was no sign of significant voter fraud during the voting process. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency and its election partners called the 2020 election ""the most secure in American history."" Former Attorney General William Barr said the Justice Department had uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud. Barr reiterated that point before his Dec. 23 resignation.  Not one of the 62 lawsuits that Trump and his allies filed in state and federal courts has proved that voter fraud affected the election outcome. The suits have been dismissed by Democratic-appointed and Republican-appointed judges. PolitiFact has fact-checked dozens of allegations of voter fraud before and after Election Day. Under the Constitution, states have the power to administer elections and count votes. The states certified their results, some following audits and recounts, almost a month ago. Each state has its own process for certifying results, but here is how the process generally works: After voters cast their ballots, local election workers tabulate them at ballot-counting centers, where Republican, Democratic and nonpartisan challengers observe the process. They verify that the results match the number of votes cast, and that provisional ballots were cast legally.  Local election offices then send the results to a county canvassing or certification board, which is typically bipartisan. If there doesn’t appear to be a problem with the vote tally, the results are passed on to the state for final certification.  A state canvassing board, the secretary of state or other officials certify the election results. Each state had until Dec. 8 to certify its results and send them to the federal government. Anyone can access copies of the Electoral College certificates from the National Archives. There is no credible reason to believe that that process was plagued by fraud in 2020. In Georgia, where Biden had one of his slimmest margins of victory, two recounts — including one conducted by hand — reaffirmed his victory. Georgia’s secretary of state, a Republican, has repeatedly swatted down claims that voter fraud affected the vote. Both chambers of Congress met Jan. 6 to formally count the Electoral College votes and finalize the election results, but the session was disrupted by the Capitol breach. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Jan. 6 that Congress would reconvene that night to count electoral votes.  When that does happen, there is no real chance that the election results will be overturned. In his address to the Senate before the chamber was evacuated, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called on his colleagues to accept the outcome of the election. ""Nothing before us proves illegality anywhere near the massive scale, the massive scale that would have tipped the entire election — nor can public doubt alone justify a radical break when the doubt itself was incited without any evidence,"" he said. ""The voters, the courts, and the states have all spoken. They've all spoken. If we overrule them, it would damage our republic forever. This election actually was not unusually close."" In a speech to his supporters on a violent day in Washington, Trump said he won the 2020 election ""in a landslide."" That’s ridiculously wrong. He didn’t win at all, let alone in a landslide. Biden won the presidential election with 306 electoral votes, to Trump’s 232. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their votes, which Congress will formally tally before Biden’s inauguration. None of the 62 lawsuits that Trump and his allies filed after Election Day has proved that voter fraud affected the election outcome. Federal agencies and state election officials have repeatedly said there is no evidence of widespread fraud. Trump’s claim is Pants on Fire!

High-Ranking California Republican Lawmaker Pushes Misinformation About Storming of U.S. Capitol
","One of California’s highest ranking Republican leaders baselessly pinned Wednesday’s storming of the U.S. Capitol on antifa, despite overwhelming video evidence showing it was supporters of President Trump who broke into the building in Washington, D.C. ""Patriots don’t act like this !!! This was Antifa,"" Sen. Shannon Grove wrote in a Tweet, which has since been deleted.  Grove is from Bakersfield and is the state Senate Republican Leader.  Grove’s post, which was live on Twitter for only a few moments approximately, cited a separate tweet and photo from attorney and Trump supporter Lin Wood. He claimed two men in the photo are affiliated with antifa, a loosely affiliated group of far-left anti-fascism activists. The problem? One of the men was quickly identified by journalists who track far-right extremism as a neo-Nazi. Similar groundless claims about antifa appeared on Facebook and in pro-Trump media, including from Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) who tweeted ""ANTIFA fascists in backwards MAGA hats,"" suggesting that some members of the violent mob were not supporters of the president. But video and photographs from the scene show people wearing and waving Trump-branded paraphernalia and flags. Reporters covering the events described the crowd as Trump supporters. The crowd also included supporters of the QAnon conspiracy theory, according to reporters present. Trump spoke to a rally of supporters in Washington hours before the violence erupted, and he urged them to come to the city on Jan. 6 and back his efforts to overturn the election.  Grove’s spokesperson declined an interview request and cited a follow-up tweet by the senator, which reads: ""This is unacceptable.

Ted Cruz’s misleading statement on people who believe the election was ‘rigged’
","As Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, challenged Arizona’s presidential election results on the Senate floor, he claimed that it’s not just Republicans who think the election was ""rigged."" A sizable percentage of independents and Democrats believed so, too, he claimed. ""Recent polling shows that 39% of Americans believe the election that just occurred was ‘rigged.’ You may not agree with that assessment, but it is nonetheless a reality for nearly half the country,"" said Cruz. ""I would note it is not just Republicans who believe that. 31% of independents agree with that statement. 17% of Democrats believe the election was rigged."" President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump in the Nov. 3 election. State election officials and courts have said that allegations from Trump and his allies about fraud in the election are meritless. Congress met in a joint session Jan. 6 to affirm Biden’s victory and count the Electoral College votes, but broke into separate discussions in the House and Senate chambers to consider objections to the tally from Arizona. Cruz’s statement on the Senate floor came before a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, forcing a halt to the constitutional procedure. We checked Cruz’s claim about the percentages of people who believe the election was ""rigged,"" and found it misleading. Cruz made a similar claim in a Jan. 2 statement, citing Reuters/Ipsos polling. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted between Nov. 13-17. The online survey included a sample of 1,346 American adults. The sample included 598 Democrats, 496 Republicans and 149 independents. (Some respondents did not identify as any of the three.) The survey asked respondents to indicate: ""how much you agree or disagree"" with the statement: ""I am concerned that the election is rigged."" Here are the results: All respondents: Independents:     Democrats: Cruz's office said he arrived at the figures in his claim by adding the percentages for ""strongly agree"" and ""somewhat agree."" But his overall claim is not the most accurate interpretation of the polling results, according to Ipsos. ""Our perspective is that question isn’t a definitive statement that the election was in fact rigged. For that, we use a separate question in the same survey,"" Chris Jackson, an Ipsos pollster, told PolitiFact. The survey also asked: ""What comes close to your view of the 2020 election?"" The choices were ""legitimate and accurate,"" ""the result of illegal voting or election rigging,"" or ""don’t know."" ""The result of illegal voting or election rigging"" was chosen by 28% all respondents, 20% of independents, and 6% of Democrats. Those figures are much lower than what Cruz cited. For Cruz to back his point, the ""more accurate number to cite"" would be the lower percentages, Jackson said on Twitter. ""And of that 28%, the large, large majority (79%) are Republicans. The plurality get their news from Fox (31%), other sources (18%) or don't follow news (24%), suggesting belief in rigging is a bit circular,"" Jackson tweeted. It’s also worth noting that the poll was done in mid-November, as legal challenges from Trump’s campaign were still ongoing. Other polls about the election phrased their questions differently, but generally, they show that most Americans trusted the results and thought the 2020 election was free and fair. Republicans were less likely to trust the outcome. One poll from the Monmouth University Polling Institute found that ""confidence in the election’s fairness went up among both independents (from 56% to 69%) and Democrats (from 68% to 90%) pre-election to post-election."" Cruz said 39% of Americans, 31% of independents, and 17% of Democrats ""believe the election was rigged."" Cruz’s office said his claim is based on a specific poll and the total percentage of respondents who ""somewhat"" or ""strongly"" agreed with the statement: ""I am concerned that the election is rigged."" That doesn’t necessarily mean they thought it was rigged. Another question in the survey asked people more directly about their view of the election. The percentage of people who said the election was ""the result of illegal voting or election rigging"" was much lower than the numbers Cruz cited. Other polls show far greater confidence in the integrity of the election. Cruz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

No, court did not rule 200,000 Wisconsin ballots were illegitimate
","President Donald Trump spent the months leading up to the election sowing doubt about the security of the voting process. Following his loss to Democrat Joe Biden, Trump has continued to flood Twitter with false claims about the election. Accordingly, many of his backers have amplified any lifeline they can find to show election fraud on a scale that would tip the election — even though election officials across the country have unanimously said no such fraud exists and lawsuits contending otherwise have failed at every turn. In that environment, social media posts misstating court rulings have found an eager audience. That included one Dec. 25, 2020 post that went viral again in early January. It said, ""FB WILL NOT ALLOW TO SHARE THE ARTICLE... Breaking: Judge Rules Over 200,000 Biden Votes Are Illegitimate In Wisconsin THIS IS A HISTORIC MOMENT TO SAVE THE COUNTRY!"" This article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Aside from the initial sharing claim, the text is identical to another viral claim from a Dec. 22 Facebook post, and it matches wording from a Dec. 22 article from the Gateway Pundit. The conservative website regularly shares skewed and fabricated claims about the 2020 election. All the claims are flat wrong. At issue is a section of Wisconsin statute that allows voters to declare themselves as ""indefinitely confined."" They can then cast an absentee ballot without providing a photo ID, as would be required for in-person voting or a traditional absentee ballot. The number of people claiming this status in Wisconsin rose from 57,000 in the 2016 presidential election to about 215,000 in the November 2020 election. That's about 7% of the Wisconsin vote in 2020. Trump and other Republicans have attacked this method of voting as improper, though it's worth noting more Wisconsin voters claimed that status in counties won by Trump than in those won by Biden, according to an analysis by the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. There's no way to know how those ""indefinitely confined"" people specifically voted, however. The indefinitely confined status sparked an array of legal challenges after clerks in the heavily Democratic Milwaukee and Dane counties contended in spring that all voters could claim that status due to a COVID-19 stay-at-home order in place at the time. The Wisconsin Election Commission and an initial order from the Wisconsin Supreme Court said that was wrong, and the clerks rescinded their advice. A final ruling from the state Supreme Court released Dec. 14 affirmed that initial order and said it's up to each voter whether they meet the requirements for being ""indefinitely confined"" — not clerks or anyone else. Later that same day, the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled in favor of former Vice President Joe Biden and election officials in a lawsuit brought by Trump on the matter.  The majority decision said ""ballots would not count"" if voters falsely claimed they were indefinitely confined. But the court did not give license to throw out large numbers of ballots without making determinations about the status of each individual voter, as Trump had sought. That decision would have to be made on a case-by-case basis. With that context, let's take a closer look at the errant Facebook claim. For starters, it labels all the indefinitely confined votes as being ""Biden votes."" This is unknowable and unprovable since we don't know how individual people voted. But we already know these voters were concentrated slightly more in pro-Trump counties, and we know it's not reasonable to expect nearly every one of these voters to be from the same party. (The Gateway Pundit article where this claim originated repeats this in claiming indefinitely confined ballots were ""unquestionably votes for Joe Biden,"" though it presents no arguments or evidence to support that.) More importantly, the claim's core claim is nonsense. It says a judge ruled all those votes were illegitimate, and that's simply not the case. The ruling specifically denied Trump's request to throw out all the votes. While the court said any ballots cast by people who falsely claimed that status wouldn't count, that's a determination that would have to be made on a case-by-case basis. The two people who posted claims in this vein on Facebook did not respond to requests for comment. The author of the Gateway Pundit article, Joe Hoff, defended his story in an email, reiterating without evidence that the court decision meant ""most"" votes from indefinitely confined voters weren't legitimate. Several Facebook posts echoed an article’s claims that a judge had ruled over 200,000 Biden votes in Wisconsin were illegitimate. There is no evidence all the ballots in question here backed Biden, and the description of the court ruling is simply wrong.  The court expressly ruled against an attempt to throw out indefinitely confined votes en masse, saying votes were only invalid if the individual casting them falsely claimed that status. And that's a determination that has to be made on a case-by-case basis. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2021/jan/06/facebook-posts/no-court-did-not-rule-200000-wisconsin-ballots-wer/

""It’s a federal crime to shred ballots. It’s not happening, and if there was evidence as such, law enforcement would be called and there would be an investigation."" Sterling also said there’s nothing to be gained by shredding ballots. Election officials have a record of the number of people who voted, and if there was evidence of missing ballots, an audit would follow. ""We have shredded nothing,"" Fulton County spokesperson Jessica Corbitt-Dominguez wrote in an email. ""Absentee ballots come in two envelopes. Those envelopes must be opened for the ballots to be counted.

No evidence Georgia ‘happened to find’ ballots to hurt Republicans in Senate runoff, as Trump claims
","President Donald Trump lobbed baseless claims that sought to discredit Georgia’s runoff election, hours after the results showed both Democratic candidates for U.S. Senate ahead. Decision desks and news outlets have called one race in favor of Democrat Raphael Warnock, who leads Sen. Kelly Loeffler by over 54,000 votes. As of this writing, Democrat Jon Ossoff leads Republican Sen. David Perdue in the second contest, which is closer. ""They just happened to find 50,000 ballots late last night,"" Trump tweeted Jan. 6. ""The USA is embarrassed by fools. Our Election Process is worse than that of third world countries!"" Trump offered no evidence of wrongdoing in the count, and officials PolitiFact spoke to did not find any.  Gabriel Sterling, Georgia’s Republican voting system implementation manager, tweeted in response to Trump: ""No Mr. President, there weren’t ‘found’ ballots."" ""We have known the number of advanced votes since this weekend,"" Sterling continued. ""We saw record Election Day turnout. As of Monday 970,000 absentees had been accepted. 31k more were added in yesterday’s totals. That leaves 60k that came in yesterday.""  No Mr. President, there weren’t “found” ballots.

""They looked at the ballots uploaded overnight, which are ballots we knew about. We talked about it at our last interview around 2 a.m. We don’t find 50,000. You count the 50,000 you had."" In a press conference Jan. 6, Sterling said Trump was undermining faith in the election process. He said officials have known since the weekend that DeKalb County, east of Atlanta, already had about 171,000 early ballots, a point he also made on Twitter the night of the election. Amber McReynolds, chief executive officer of the National Vote at Home Institute, agreed that there is no evidence that Georgia election workers ""happened to find"" any improper votes. ""Election officials are following the law and processing ballots. Ballots do not just magically get processed,"" McReynolds told PolitiFact. ""It takes time and people and equipment to process ballots. Georgia officials are following the law and ensuring that every vote cast is counted."" The Trump campaign and White House did not respond to PolitiFact’s inquiries.  Trump’s comments about Georgia echoed similarly unsubstantiated allegations he lodged about the race he lost to Joe Biden in November. As PolitiFact reported, it’s typical for vote tallies to come in batches as counties report their results. This happened throughout the night of Georgia’s runoff election, the Associated Press reported.  Trump said Georgia ""just happened to find"" 50,000 votes. That’s a ridiculous and inaccurate way to describe the counting of legally cast ballots. We rate his statement Pants on Fire!

No grounds for claim that Raffensperger could face spy charges over Trump call
","The telephone call President Donald Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger — in which he implored Raffensperger to ""find"" enough votes to overturn his defeat in Georgia — was part of Trump’s attempt to remain in the White House.  It led to calls for a criminal investigation and even for Trump’s impeachment, with only weeks before his term ends and President-elect Joe Biden is inaugurated. But not all of the backlash was aimed at Trump. The fact that the Jan. 2 call was recorded and leaked to the news media also spurred a claim that Raffensperger ""faces espionage charges."" The claim was made in a widely shared Facebook post that was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Legal experts told us it would not be illegal for anyone on either end of the call to record it, or to disseminate the recording. Furthermore, the conversation did not bear on sensitive national security matters covered by the federal Espionage Act. ""This is silly,"" said University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck, whose specialties include national security and constitutional law. ""Not only is there no universe in which the conversation between Trump and Raffensperger included the kind of ‘information relating to the national defense’ that’s covered by the Espionage Act, but the president himself publicly described the conversation"" the next day in a tweet. ""There’s nothing close to a crime here."" Raffensperger, a Republican, has maintained that Georgia’s returns accurately reflected a Biden victory in the Nov. 3 election. Votes were counted three times, showing Biden won by nearly 12,000 votes. In the call, Trump told Raffensperger: ""All I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state."" The Jan. 4 Facebook post is from Conversation Controversy, which is identified as a media user on Facebook. It includes a 2.5-minute video narrated by Doug TenNapel, who is a graphic novelist, video game designer and a former writer for the conservative website Breitbart.  In the video, TenNapel doesn’t mention espionage, but cites a Jan. 4 article by the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, that does.  The article references a Jan. 3 tweet by Jack Posobiec, a reporter for One America News Network, a conservative cable news service. The tweet, which alludes to the Washington Post story that revealed the telephone call, claimed that the White House is ""planning to refer Brad Raffensperger WaPo leak to Secret Service for investigation under national security grounds of the Espionage Act."" Neither the article nor the tweet cites any evidence that Raffensperger is facing espionage charges. The White House, the Secret Service and TenNapel didn’t reply to our requests for information. As for how the recording was leaked, the Post and the Atlanta Journal-Constitution both reported that they obtained the recording the day after the phone conversation, but did not say how they obtained it. Raffensperger’s office did not respond to our requests for comment.  Vladeck and Asha Rangappa, a Yale University national security law instructor and former FBI agent, said that both Georgia and Washington, D.C., are one-party consent jurisdictions — meaning it is legal to record, and to distribute recordings, made with only one party’s consent. Raffensperger has indicated that the recording was released because Trump’s tweet ""broke privacy"" and contained false information. Trump’s tweet said that in the call, Raffensperger was ""unwilling, or unable, to answer questions"" about voter fraud in Georgia. ""If President Trump wouldn’t have tweeted anything and would have stayed silent, we would have stayed silent, as well,"" Raffensperger said in a TV interview. Vladeck knocked down Posobiec’s report on Twitter. He and Rangappa said the FBI, not the Secret Service, investigates violations of the Espionage Act. Given that the phone conversation had to do with counting votes in Georgia, ""to me, it’s absurd on its face"" that disclosing what was said could violate the Espionage Act, Rangappa said. The Espionage Act ""covers certain unauthorized disclosures of ‘national defense’ information,"" said Columbia University law professor David Pozen.  ""Even the most expansive definitions of this term that I’ve ever seen proposed would not cover what happened here. The idea that Raffensperger should face Espionage Act charges is absurd and outrageous."" A Facebook post claimed Raffensperger ""faces espionage charges."" There is no evidence for the claim.  Moreover, legal experts said it is not illegal for Raffensperger or anyone on the call between him and Trump to have recorded the call, or to have shared the recording. And disclosing discussions about ballot counting in Georgia do not involve sensitive national defense information that would invoke the Espionage Act, the experts said.

Posts about D.C. bill that allows children to be vaccinated without parental consent needs context
","A law recently went into effect in Washington, D.C., that allows children ages 11 and older to receive certain vaccinations without parental approval if a doctor deems them capable of giving informed consent.  But some posts on Facebook share a screenshot from a website called the Conservative Brief, which misleadingly displays a photo of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, and features a headline that reads: ""D.C. Passes Bill to Immunize Children Without Parental Knowledge, Consent."" The headline is repeated in text above Fauci’s photo, but swaps out the word ""D.C."" for ""Dems."" Additional text, which comes from the article, also appears in the post and says, ""The bill not only permits children of this age (11+) to provide consent to doctors and other vaccine administrators without a parent’s knowledge or consent, but also requires insurance companies, school administrators, and medical personnel to conceal from parents that…"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Washington, D.C., city officials did pass and enact a law that allows minors 11 and older to get certain vaccinations without parental approval if they are deemed able to consent by a doctor. But Fauci had nothing to do with it. And more context is needed than what is presented on social media. The bill in question, ""B23-0171 - Minor Consent for Vaccinations Amendment Act of 2019,"" was introduced in the D.C. city council on March 5, 2019 and enacted on Dec. 23, 2020.  Under the legislation, children age 11 and older are permitted to receive government-recommended vaccines that their parents object to on religious grounds, if a doctor agrees. The law covers vaccines for a range of illnesses including polio, measles, mumps and rubella, as well as the COVID-19 coronavirus and human papillomavirus, which is recommended for older children.  The law requires doctors who are employing the legislation send the immunization records to the child’s school and seek payment directly from the insurance company, rather than involving parents. These circumstances can come into play if the parents are using a religious exemption that allows their child to attend school without being vaccinated against communicable diseases.  The legislation was created in response to the country’s 2019 measles outbreak, which was believed to have been fueled by parents’ refusal to vaccinate their children.   A representative of the D.C. chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics, which strongly supported the bill, said vaccination rates at the city’s public schools range from 87 to 93 percent but have fallen below 85 percent at some charter schools, according to a report by the Washington Post.  A famous example of a teen circumventing parental consent over vaccinations came in 2017, when Ethan Lindenberger, who has since become a public health advocate, got vaccinated against his mother’s wishes when he turned 18. Some states already allow minors to get vaccinated without parental permission, but rules vary widely. There is no federal law that allows U.S. children as young as 11 to get vaccinated without parental approval. A Facebook post shares an article screenshot that features Dr. Anthony Fauci and says ""D.C. Passes Bill to Immunize Children Without Parental Knowledge, Consent."" The city of Washington, D.C., passed a bill that allows minors 11 and older to get certain government-recommended vaccinations without their parent’s consent. No such law exists at the federal level. And Fauci had nothing to do with the legislation. Also, the headline obscures that children would first have to be willing to receive the vaccination and that a doctor would have to agree they are capable of making that decision.  We define Half True as a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Yes, L.A. Hospitals Were Packed With COVID-19 Patients, Contrary To Viral Video’s Claims
","A deceptive and widely viewed Facebook video claimed Los Angeles hospitals did not face a recent surge of COVID-19 patients. The footage made the rounds and was believed by Facebook users despite strong evidence to the contrary from health officials and media reports. The anti-mask activist who shot the video made a sweeping conclusion: There are  ""absolutely no patients"" at Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital in Los Angeles, according to the video, posted on New Year’s Day. The activist also referred to hospital staff as ""useful idiots.""  A hospital representative rejected the video’s assertions as baseless.  The footage mostly shows the hospital’s deserted outpatient center. But this is not where COVID-19 patients arrive, as pointed out by some of the comments on the video.  Most patients arrive through separate ambulance and emergency department entrances, said Gwendolyn Driscoll, spokesperson for MLK Jr. Community Hospital. ""There is no substance whatsoever to her allegations,"" Driscoll wrote in an email, referring to the activist.  The hospital is located in a mostly Black and Latino south L.A. neighborhood where many residents are essential workers who are continually exposed to COVID-19. It also serves some unhoused individuals. The hospital is considered among the hardest hit in Southern California, where post-holiday COVID-19 cases have skyrocketed.  In a striking example, the number of cases in Los Angeles County doubled from 400,000 on Nov. 30 to 800,000 on Jan. 2, according to the county’s public health department. That led to patients overwhelming area hospitals, including an oxygen shortage at five facilities, forcing them to close to all ambulance traffic for several hours. The Facebook video was flagged as part of the social media company’s effort to combat false news and misinformation. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook.) It had been shared 1,000 times and viewed more than 18,000 times as of early this week. Converting ‘Every Nook And Cranny’ To Patient Space To fact check the video’s claim, we relied on statements and data from officials at MLK Jr. Community Hospital, along with other health and emergency service officials. We also reviewed recent news reports, photos and videos showing the impact of the COVID-19 surge on hospitals in the L.A. area.  A Dec. 19 report by CBS News shows patients inside a triage area set up at MLK Jr. Community Hospital’s ambulance bay. Additionally, a KTLA TV news report this week shows a similar tent set up outside the hospital.  A Dec. 29 report by ABC 7 Los Angeles shows footage of patients on gurneys waiting in hallways at an unidentified hospital, while several news clips include footage of ambulances waiting outside emergency rooms with patients still inside.  ""We have converted every conceivable nook and cranny in the hospital into patient care space,"" Dr. Elaine Batchlor, Martin Luther King Jr. Community Hospital CEO, told ABC News last month. ""We're doing everything that we can."" The Facebook video shows the both the outpatient center and the main entrance to MLK Jr. Community Hospital. There’s little activity at either location. Driscoll, the hospital spokesperson, said that’s because these ""are not patient areas"" and few COVID-19 patients come in through the main doors.  She also cited a data analysis showing MLK Jr. Community Hospital had the highest rate of COVID-19 patient volume to hospital bed capacity of any nearby hospital in late December. It shows 97% of its 131 licensed beds were being used by COVID-19 patients the week before Christmas, a higher rate than each of the dozens of other hospitals within 15 miles.   SOURCE: MLK Jr. Community Hospital Driscoll says the hospital’s figures are based on an analysis of data from the U.S. Department of Health and Human services, which publishes COVID-19 data at hospitals nationwide.  As of late December, the hospital remained well over capacity with 225 total patients, when combining those with and without the virus, according to the Los Angeles Times. ‘Every Bed Occupied By A Ventilated COVID Patient’ Staff at MLK Jr. Community Hospital aren’t the only ones dealing with the impacts of the area’s coronavirus surge.  The situation at nearby Los Angeles County-USC Medical Center was also dire, chief medical officer Dr. Brad Spellberg told the Times last week.  ""When you walk into the ICU, and you see every bed occupied by a ventilated COVID patient, with tubes coming in all orifices of their body, you begin to understand that we are not dealing with what we were dealing with 10 months ago,"" Spellberg said in the Times article. There was not one available bed for at least 30 patients who needed intensive or intermediate levels of care, Spellberg added in the article, and the hospital had to shut its doors to all ambulance traffic for 12 hours.  In this Dec. 17, 2020, photo, medical tents are set up outside the emergency room at UCI Medical Center in Irvine, Calif. California hospitals are facing increasingly difficult decisions about which services to postpone amid a crushing load of coronavirus patients. Intensive-care beds are full in Southern California and the Central Valley, with statewide availability at only 1.1%. (AP Photo/Ashley Landis, File) Regional health officials warned the impact to hospitals is even more serious this week, as the post-Christmas and New Year’s Eve surge of cases and patients is just beginning.  ""We are still encouraging people to only come to the emergency department or to call 911 if you have a medical emergency or psychiatric emergency,"" Los Angeles County Public Health Services Director Christina Ghaly said at a press conference on Monday. ""Ambulances are still having to wait many hours to offload patients to the emergency room.""  Our Ruling A misleading Facebook video alleged Los Angeles hospitals were not overwhelmed with patients following the recent COVID-19 surge. Specifically, it said there were ""absolutely no patients"" at Martin Luther King, Jr. Community Hospital in south Los Angeles. That claim is a far cry from reality. Video from news reports along with patient data and statements from the hospital all show MLK Jr. Community Hospital, like many in the region, was flooded with patients last month as COVID-19 cases soared.  Additionally, the Facebook video was filmed at the hospital’s outpatient center, which is not where COVID-19 patients arrive. They come in through separate emergency department and ambulance entrances.  A hospital spokesperson described the claim as groundless.  Based on the evidence, we agree and rate it Pants On Fire.

Constitution does not allow Mike Pence to reject electoral votes
","When Congress meets to formally count the votes from the Electoral College Jan. 6, President Donald Trump has said Vice President Mike Pence can turn a loss into a win. Typically, in a joint session of Congress, the vice president opens the envelopes from each state containing the results that determine which candidate got that state’s electoral votes. These results, in the form of official certificates, have been signed and sealed. The vice president opens each one, hands them to four members from the House and Senate who read the results out loud, and at the end, the vice president announces the final tally. As many as 140 House members and over a dozen senators have said they will challenge some of the state results. Trump tweeted that Pence himself could do that. ""The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors,"" Trump tweeted Jan. 5 The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors. We asked the White House press office for the legal basis of that claim and did not hear back. Many scholars say there’s nothing in the Constitution or legislation that gives the vice president the power Trump claims. Trump’s statement focuses on Pence’s ability to sway the outcome. This is separate from what we know to be the ability of members of Congress to challenge the results. If at least one senator and one representative object to the results from a given state, both chambers vote to sustain or reject the complaint. Only if both chambers sustain the complaint are the results thrown out. When it comes to counting the votes, the 12th Amendment says, ""The President of the Senate shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted."" To Hofstra University law professor Richard Neumann — and many of his colleagues — the meaning of those words is plain. ""The Constitution gives a vice president, as president of the Senate, only one role, which is to open envelopes,"" Neumann said. ""The vice president’s constitutional duty to open envelopes is ministerial."" Neumann said the law offers no exceptions. The vice president must open every packet of results. The next relevant law comes from the Electoral Control Act of 1887. That’s the law that guides the process on Jan. 6. It, too, undercuts Trump’s tweet. ""Nothing in the statute gives a vice president a role in deciding disputes,"" Neumann said. Under that law, resolving disputes falls to members of Congress. And while the vice president is the president of the Senate, that doesn’t make that person a senator. The Constitution defines the vice president as an officer of the executive branch. Law professor Ilya Somin at George Mason University said there’s a good reason the law doesn’t give Pence any say over which electoral votes are valid, and which are not. ""If he did, he would have an obvious conflict of interest anytime he is himself a candidate for president or VP — as is the case this year, actually,"" Somin said. A federal judge threw out a suit that aimed to give Pence the power to reject electoral votes. The Justice Department also argued against it. That, however, was based on the standing of the plaintiffs, not the merits of the case itself.  Some legal analysts say that states retain full control over elections, and not even Congress can interfere with the outcome. ""Neither the vice president nor Congress has the power to reject electoral votes,"" wrote Alan Charles Raul and Richard Bernstein in the Wall Street Journal. Raul is former associate counsel to President Ronald Reagan and Bernstein is a retired appellate attorney. ""The 12th Amendment vests no power in the vice president or Congress to judge who won a state’s electoral votes when the authorized branches of the state’s government agree, as they do here, on which electors won,"" they wrote Jan. 3. ""The word ‘counted’ provides no basis for anyone to override anything. When a person counts the number of games his favorite team has won, that person has no power to alchemize losses into wins."" The U.S. Supreme Court has not ruled directly on the question of the vice president’s role in the Electoral College count, but in 2020 it did affirm the power of the states over presidential elections in a case involving ""faithless electors"" — those who wanted to vote for the candidate of their choice.  ""Their ‘faithless elector’ ruling rests on the assumption that states have near-total control over the selection of their electors,"" Somin said. Trump focused on ""fraudulently chosen electors."" If there were evidence of massive fraud on a scale that would flip the results, there might be legal grounds for Congress to act. But in lawsuit after lawsuit, no judge has found any evidence to back up that allegation. In explaining why he would vote to affirm the Electoral College results, Sen. Ben Sasse, R-Neb., cited a Trump-appointed judge who threw out a challenge in Pennsylvania. ""Calling an election unfair does not make it so. Charges require specific allegations and then proof. We have neither here,"" Sasse wrote Dec. 31. But again, this would only grant Congress the power to do something. Not the vice president. Trump said, ""The Vice President has the power to reject fraudulently chosen electors."" His office provided no legal basis for that assertion, and multiple legal scholars have said that no law gives the vice president any role beyond reading the results from the states. Based on the text of the Constitution, existing law and prevailing scholarship, we rate this claim False.
