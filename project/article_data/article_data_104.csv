Donna Howard says child care in some states costs more than average college tuition
","Touting the Democratic presidential nominee, a Texas legislator said: ""Hillary Clinton would provide all working families with relief from child-care costs, which in some states now exceed the average price tag for college tuition."" State Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, floated her comparison in an August  2016 press conference called by Democratic leaders from Austin critical of Republican nominee Donald Trump, who was rallying Austin-area supporters later the same day. Clinton has said she’ll focus on ensuring quality child care for all in part by making sure no family has to devote more than 10 percent of its income to child care. For the Truth-O-Meter’s sake, we wondered if child care costs exceed college tuition in some states. In 2014, PolitiFact found Mostly True President Barack Obama’s claim that in 31 states, ""decent child care costs more than college tuition."" Obama’s conclusion was cherry-picked from several results from an advocacy group’s 2013 survey of child care costs. Obama also ignored uncertainty about how federal aid and tax credits might affect the comparison. When we inquired about Howard’s claim, Scott Daigle, her chief of staff, said by email she primarily drew on research posted online by the liberal Economic Policy Institute. A web search led us to an October 2015 institute breakout suggesting child care costs for a 4-year-old exceeded in-state tuition at a public college in 24 states in 2014 -- though not Texas. In Texas, such child care costs were estimated to be 91 percent of average in-state public college tuition. But Texas was one of 33 states where child care costs for an infant — which are usually higher than for older children — amounted to 118 percent of the state’s average public college in-state tuition.    SOURCE: Report, ""High quality child care is out of reach for working families,"" Economic Policy Institute, Oct. 6, 2015 And where did this data originate? The institute’s source for college costs was a March 2015 table from the National Center for Education Statistics showing average undergraduate in-state tuition and required fees for each state. By phone, the institute’s Elise Gould told us the institute fetched its child care cost figures from the results of a 2014 survey by Child Care Aware for America, a national nonprofit that says it seeks child care policies improving the lives of children and families. The group says in its 2014 report that the survey relied on state and local Child Care Resource and Referral offices to provide 2013 cost data related to the average price of child care for infants and 4-year-old children ""in legally operating child care centers and family child care homes."" Six states including Texas didn’t deliver information, the report states, so the price of child care in those states was adjusted from prior years’ data. Upshot, per the group: ""In 2013, the average annual cost for an infant in center-based care was higher than a year’s tuition and fees at a four-year public college in 31 states and the District of Columbia. Even the annual average cost of care for a four-year-old in a center, which is less expensive than care for an infant, was higher than public college tuition and fees in 20 states."" For Texas, a chart shows, the $6,643 for one year of child care for a 4-year-old (adjusted from 2012 data) trailed $8,522 in average annual tuition and fees at a public college. We noticed that the group’s 2015 report states that its survey taken that year showed that in 2014, the average annual cost for an infant in center-based care was higher than a year’s tuition and fees at a four-year public college in 28 states, though not Texas--a conclusion that differs with the institute's findings. ""Even the annual average cost of care for a four-year-old in a center, which is less expensive than care for an infant, was higher than public college tuition and fees in 19 states,"" the report states, Texas narrowly not among them. Infant care at a Texas center averaged $8,759; child care for a four-year-old averaged $6,730; average in-state public college tuition in Texas was $8,830, the report says. Gould said of Howard’s claim: ""That seems true no matter how you measure it."" Our ruling Howard said child care costs ""in some states now exceed the average price tag for college tuition."" State surveys and federal college tuition data suggest this contrast held in 2014 for around 20 to 30 states. The count varies depending on whether you focus on what's levied to care for a toddler or more costly infant care. We rate the statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

"['Jobs', 'Trade', 'New York', 'John Plumb']","
Reed has voted for trade deals
","U.S. Rep. Tom Reed has come out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade accord with 11 Pacific Rim nations, but a Democrat trying to unseat him has made a point of reminding voters about his votes on other trade deals. ""He has actually voted for every single trade deal that has ever come before him in any form,"" John Plumb said in an interview on Capital Tonight. Plumb, like others, believes some free trade agreements have hurt the region economically. Reed, R-Corning, first took office in 2011, and he’s taken conservative positions in a Congress where Republicans hold the majority. Plumb, who most recently served as a military aide in the Obama administration, moved back to the Jamestown area in May to run against Reed in the Southern Tier’s sprawling 23rd Congressional District.   While Reed has come out against the Trans-Pacific Partnership, that trade deal has yet to come up for a vote in Congress. But others have, so we checked his record to see if he voted for every single trade deal that has come before him so far. Voting on trade deals Since Reed took office, the United States has entered into three trade agreements. The agreements  - with Panama, Colombia and South Korea - took effect in 2012. Each reduced trade barriers between the United States and those countries. Reed voted in favor of all three when they came to the floor of the House of Representatives for roll call votes. Reed also voted in 2015 to implement what’s known as Trade Promotion Authority. It has been used for decades to allow the sitting president to negotiate major trade deals with consultation from Congress. In this case, Congress gave President Obama authority to negotiate the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The legislation itself is not a trade deal but is seen as a precursor to one. The Trans-Pacific Partnership would eliminate tariffs on goods and services, remove non-tariff barriers and set rules for trade and business investment among the United States and other countries in the proposed accord, including Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Singapore and Vietnam. New York’s congressional delegation was mixed on the TPA bill because some saw it as a procedural pre-approval for the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Reed voted for the legislation, but he has said he does not support the negotiated Trans-Pacific Partnership. ""Tom Reed opposes TPP. He has done so since the text was made available by the Obama administration,"" said Amy Hasenberg, a spokeswoman for his campaign. ""Like every trade deal that has come before Tom, he evaluated it on its merits. For Western New York, TPP didn't have any merits."" Voting for free trade Other votes in Congress impact free trade, too. The Cato Institute has compiled votes in Congress on legislation supporting or limiting free trade. One measure, for example, resurrected the Export-Import Bank. Reed voted in favor of resurrecting the Export-Import Bank in 2015 after its authority lapsed for five months.The bank offers credit to a small percentage of foreign buyers who may not be able to afford interest rates available on the free market. The bank subsidizes financing to those buyers by offering lower rates. The institute says the subsidies help some American companies at the expense of domestic customers, foreign suppliers, and other exporters. The bank promotes trade for some products made in the United States over others. The institute says this infringes on free trade. ""It’s paying them to do business with American companies,"" said Bill Watson, a trade policy analyst from the Cato Institute. ""The companies get a lower interest rate than they would in the free market. ""It does that by putting U.S. taxpayers on the line by guaranteeing financing,"" he added Simon Johnson of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology agrees, but he said that while export subsidies may reduce free trade, they typically increase trade overall. Our ruling In an interview, Plumb said Reed ""has actually voted for every single trade deal that has ever come before him in any form."" Congress has voted on three trade agreements with other nations since Reed took office in 2011, and a look at the roll calls confirmed he voted for each one. Reed did vote to reauthorize the Export-Import bank. But Plumb got it right when he said the congressman voted for the trade agreements. We rate this claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097216A40>],/factchecks/2016/sep/02/john-plumb/reed-has-voted-trade-deals-opposes-tpp/

Sean Hannity says illegal immigrants account for up to 75 percent of convictions for selected crimes
","During Austin tapings of his Fox News show, Sean Hannity thrice showed figures suggesting immigrants living in the U.S. without legal permission have lately been convicted of up to 75 percent of federal crimes. In back-to-back August 2016 episodes featuring Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Hannity presented a slide listing the percentage of ""illegal immigrant federal convictions"" in fiscal 2015 for five crimes. On night one, most noticeably, Hannity showed the slide at the top of his show while saying ""in the last year alone, illegal immigrants"" were ""responsible for 18 percent of drug trafficking; 30 percent of kidnapping/hostage taking; 75 percent of drug possession; 10 percent of money laundering; 21 percent of national defense; and 5 percent of murder sentences,"" going on to say numerous crimes have been committed lately in Texas. Some 30 minutes later, Hannity showed the slide again and said to Trump: ""Something’s wrong."" ""Yeah, it’s wrong, it’s wrong,"" Trump replied, ""and everybody knows it’s wrong."" So, we wondered, was Hannity right about the listed crimes? His slide referenced the U.S. Sentencing Commission, which gathers information on federal crime and sentencing issues and where Sekemia Mwonyonyi replied to our inquiry with an email showing how to reach the aired figures by clicking through commission statistics posted online. Separately,  Nazgol Ghandnoosh of the Sentencing Project, which says it focuses on reforms in sentencing policy, also laid out the methodology. As a result, we built a chart demonstrating that Hannity accurately drew his numbers from data presenting percentages of 32 federal offenses for which citizens, non-citizens and, in particular, ""illegal aliens"" were sentenced in fiscal 2015. Ghandnoosh said by email that Hannity’s percentages regarding five of the federal crimes accurately tracked the commission tallies. In general, those classified as ""illegal aliens"" accounted for 25,670, or 37 percent, of 70,225 individuals convicted of all federal crimes in the 12 months through September 2015. That includes 18,782 sentenced for immigration offenses. The ""illegal alien"" category accounted for the following share of convictions in the crimes cited by Hannity: • 1,640 of 2,181 total convictions (75 percent) in which the primary charge was simple drug possession. • 13 of 43 convictions (30 percent) for kidnapping/hostage taking. • 21 of 100 convictions (21 percent) for ""national defense"" crimes, which include convictions for exporting arms, munitions or military equipment without a license or providing material support to designated foreign terrorist organizations or for terrorist purposes, per a 2013 commission report. • 3,555 of 19,989 convictions (18 percent) for drug trafficking. • 69 of 665 convictions (10 percent of them, for money laundering. • 5 of 91 convictions, or 5.5 percent, for murder. Mwonyonyi noted another aspect by pointing out to us that 73 percent of all the ""illegal alien"" federal offenders in the year--that is, 18,782 of 25,670 individuals--were primarily sentenced for immigration violations unique to the federal government. ""If you take out the immigration crimes,"" Mwonyonyi wrote, ""you find that illegal aliens committed about 14% of all non-immigration federal crimes."" Sliced another way, the commission tallies show U.S. citizens drew 51 percent or more of all convictions across 29 offense categories including manslaughter (96 percent U.S. citizens); murder (84 percent); sexual abuse (95 percent); robbery (98 percent); drug trafficking (74 percent); bribery (93 percent); money laundering (76 percent); racketeering/extortion (87 percent); child pornography (96 percent); and burglary/breaking and entering (100 percent). Notably too, Hannity’s chart presents percentages of unauthorized immigrants convicted of selected federal crimes--not exploring the residency statuses of the far greater number of U.S. residents prosecuted by state and local authorities. That's probably leaving out a lot of people. For instance, as of August 2016, Texas alone held some 146,800 state prison inmates. As we completed this fact check, federal prisons altogether held nearly 193,000 inmates. Our ruling Hannity's slide states that in fiscal 2015, ""illegal immigrants"" represented 5 percent to 75 percent of U.S. residents convicted of five federal crimes ranging from murder to simple drug possession. Those figures accurately reflect federal data though a comprehensive picture would arguably fold in individuals convicted on similar state and local charges. We rate the statement True.

"['Elections', 'States', 'Pennsylvania', 'Rob Gleason']","
Does Pennsylvania really have the power to decide the president?
","Every election, pundits and politicians alike harp on the importance of battleground states, those pockets of uncertainty within the country where less-predictable voting patterns make the outcome a bigger priority for candidates. In 2016, Pennsylvania is one of them. But do voters here bear ultimate responsibility for who is next Commander in Chief? An August 29 fundraising email from Republican Party of Pennsylvania Chairman Rob Gleason says yes. Because a new poll (not cited) showed Donald Trump to be ""within striking distance"" of Hillary Clinton, according to the email, now was a time to donate because FiveThirtyEight reported that the winner of Pennsylvania would win the election. The last statement bears a closer examination. Nate Silver’s nationally-renowned prognostication site FiveThirtyEight reports all kinds of statistical analysis in order to predict elections (and it’s gotten the last two right.) Naturally, with Pennsylvania as a battleground state, FiveThirtyEight has done a fair bit of reporting on its possible outcomes, as well as how much power it actually could have. The way FiveThirtyEight figures this out is by determining states’ ""tipping power"" ― that is, the probability that Pennsylvania, for example, will provide the deciding electoral college vote. This is determined by organizing states from most likely to least likely to vote Republican, or the same for Democrats, and finding which state will provide which candidate the 270th electoral vote needed to win (the majority of the 538 available electoral votes.) Naturally, the dialogue has evolved as the election has gotten closer, and so FiveThirtyEight’s certainty in predicting Pennsylvania to be that state with the most tipping power has also varied. In recent elections, the states that have always been the most contested were Ohio, Florida, North Carolina or Michigan. Pennsylvania is so hotly debated this year because its voting patterns have become increasingly split ― even though the Philadelphia metro area and its suburbs form a pretty solid blue voting bloc, Western Pennsylvania and other parts of the state have trended more Republican in recent elections. When asked for comment, Aaron Bycoffe pointed us to a May article about the topic, but again, the headline reads ""Why Pennsylvania Could Decide The 2016 Election."" Could. Not will. And that’s an important difference. FiveThirtyEight has dedicated plenty of coverage this year to analyzing Pennsylvania’s importance, and the site also has a regularly updated election tracker that includes a list ranking the states with the most tipping power. Currently, Pennsylvania is listed second only to Florida, but the advantage the latter has is 5.7 percentage points, which is a pretty commanding lead compared to the margins of difference between, say, Pennsylvania and the third-likely state, Ohio. Pennsylvania is edging out Ohio in tipping power by just 0.5 percent. Those numbers all still have plenty of time to change before the November election. When asked to clarify the claim, the Pennsylvania GOP referred to the reports that have most confidently handed Pennsylvania tipping power. Rather than numbers, they’ve mostly been commentary from staff, like this chat between several editors and a senior politics writer, a couple of whom answer Pennsylvania to the final question of which state will tip the election. Dave Wasserman, who writes for the Cook Political Report, also penned a piece touting the importance of the state and its increased likelihood to determine the winner. But the staff chat was in early June, and Wasserman published his piece in May. The election tracker is updated at least daily.
  Our ruling It’s true that at various points in its coverage, FiveThirtyEight strongly emphasized Pennsylvania’s potential to be the deciding vote. However, saying that it flat-out declared the Pennsylvania winner the automatic winner of the presidency is still misleading. For one thing, FiveThirtyEight itself reports predictive statistical analysis ― which is never going to produce such a definitive answer about a swing state’s power. FiveThirtyEight also makes a point of explaining in its election forecast user guide that fluctuations in polling data, which it uses to determine things like tipping power, have more meaning later in the election. So any shifts in the polls (which, given Donald Trump’s lack of predictability as a candidate, are not impossible in this election) could rearrange where that tipping power resides. It’s an effective strategy to stress the importance of a state’s electoral votes in order to get donations and constituencies to vote, but even that should be accurately represented. FiveThirtyEight’s actual election tracker still leaves ambiguity as to Pennsylvania’s ultimate tipping power. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097A7C7C0>],/factchecks/2016/sep/02/rob-gleason/does-pennsylvania-really-have-power-decide-preside/
"['Crime', 'Terrorism', 'Guns', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan: If someone ""on a terror watch list"" tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified
","A week after Omar Mateen gunned down 49 people and injured more than 50 others at a gay nightclub in Orlando in June, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, appeared on NBC’s ""Meet the Press."" Days earlier, the FBI disclosed that Mateen had previously been under investigation and was, for a time, on a terrorist watch list. Ryan was asked about legislation intended to delay or prevent people on those lists from obtaining guns. ""The question right now,"" Ryan said, ""is if someone is on a terror watch list, are the authorities notified as to whether a person on that list is trying to purchase a gun or not? That is the procedure right now."" Is Ryan right that under the current procedure, if someone ""on a terror watch list"" tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified? How gun screening works When we asked Ryan’s office to provide backup for his claim, a spokesman pointed to a 2010 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. That report states the FBI is alerted when a federal background check for a gun transfer is performed on someone whose name is on a terrorist watch list. We confirmed the same with Dave Joly, a spokesman for the FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center, and Second Amendment expert Adam Winkler, a law professor at the UCLA School of Law. Such background checks are mandated under a federal law called the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act — commonly known as the ""Brady Bill."" States can choose to conduct the background checks themselves, or have the FBI perform them. Either way, a background check involves verifying the buyer’s identity and searching for information in databases that would determine if the gun purchase is illegal. For instance, someone who is under indictment, has a felony conviction, uses illicit drugs or is an illegal immigrant is not permitted to buy a gun. Background checks typically result in approving the gun purchase, denying it or imposing a three-day delay to allow for further investigation. While conducting such checks, the federal government can screen for people whose names appear on terrorist watch lists — though the fact someone is on such a list does not alone disqualify that person from buying a gun under the Brady Bill. Indeed, the vast majority of people on terror watch lists have been allowed to purchase guns. The federal government began cross-referencing gun background checks with terrorist watch lists in 2004, and through 2015, there were 2,477 instances when someone on a terrorist watch list was involved in a gun background check. About 91 percent of those transactions were permitted, according to the Government Accountability Office. If federal authorities are notified someone on a terrorist watch list is trying to buy a gun, they can take steps to thwart the purchase. For instance, investigators can review paperwork the prospective gun buyer completed to check for other new, potentially disqualifying information. Private sales excluded Importantly, the Brady Bill does not require background checks for all gun transfers: It applies only to gun sales by federally licensed firearm dealers. Unlicensed sellers are not required to document or report sales under the law. At least 18 states and the District of Columbia have enacted laws that go beyond the Brady Bill and require background checks in some private gun sales, according to the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, a nonprofit organization that tracks firearm laws and litigation in the United States and seeks to reduce gun violence. But the other states — including Wisconsin — have no such requirement. There is no definitive figure of how many private gun sales occur, although experts have made some informed estimates. A National Institute of Justice study estimated there were 13.7 million gun transfers between 1993 and 1994 in the United States; roughly 60 percent involved licensed dealers, while about 40 percent were ""off-the-books transfers"" through unlicensed sellers. Preliminary data from a more recent, yet-to-be-published survey suggests the proportion of unlicensed gun sales has decreased, but such sales still involve millions of guns each year, according to Northeastern University Professor Matthew Miller, who co-directs the Harvard Injury Control Research Center. Our rating Ryan said that under the current procedure, if someone ""on a terror watch list"" tries to buy a gun, authorities are notified. That is accurate as it applies to gun sales in which a federal background check occurs. But a significant amount of gun sales or other transfers lack background checks, so there would be no red flag when someone on the list tries to buy a gun. For a statement that is partially accurate, but leaves out important details, we rate Ryan’s claim Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280968AA680>],/factchecks/2016/sep/02/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-if-someone-terror-watch-list-tries-buy-g/

Will California’s Prop 60 expose adult film workers to lawsuits?
","Opponents of California’s Proposition 60 — which requires adult film performers to wear condoms — say it’s not the protective measure it’s touted to be. ""This law pretends to protect workers in the adult film industry, but in fact it's putting them at risk for lawsuits and harassment,"" says a recent advertisement on YouTube by the No on 60 campaign.  The claim at the center of this fact check is at the :40 minute mark. That ad was paid for by Californians Against Worker Harassment which was founded by the Free Speech Coalition, a trade association for the adult entertainment industry, to oppose Prop 60. We wondered: Does Prop 60 — a measure intended to curb sexually transmitted diseases among porn workers — really expose those same people to legal action? We decided to fact-check that provocative claim. Our research Here’s some background on Prop 60 before we jump into the claim about lawsuits. California law has required condom use in adult films since 1992. Supporters of Prop 60 say the initiative would strengthen the existing law, which they say is rarely enforced. The measure is sponsored by the AIDS Healthcare Foundation, which has long pushed for greater safety standards in adult films. In 2012, voters in Los Angeles County approved a similar condom requirement for adult films made in that county. It is considered a model for Prop 60, which applies its condom mandate to scenes with anal and vaginal intercourse. Prop 60 would also require adult film companies to obtain a health license and pay for the costs of vaccinations and health tests for sexually transmitted diseases for their performers. We asked the No on 60 campaign for evidence backing up its claim that performers would be open to lawsuits under the measure. A spokesman pointed to the initiative’s section 6720.6, on enforcement, whistleblowers and private rights of action. It allows those who witness violations of the proposed law -- including performers, prosecutors or anyone who is a California resident -- to file a complaint with the California Division of Occupational Safety and Health. If the agency declines to pursue the case within 21 days, the witness could then file a civil lawsuit against anyone with a financial interest in the film, which could include some performers. There’s no mention in the No on 60 advertisement, however, that only performers with a financial interest would be liable. Nor does the ad mention the complaint process that must precede a lawsuit.  Robert Elyov / Flickr More porn workers with financial stake Still, opponents of the measure say making performers liable is significant because many have a financial stake in the content. ""You see, in today’s adult film industry, the majority of performers are also producers,"" Eric Paul Leue, executive director of the Free Speech Coalition, wrote in an opinion piece about Prop 60 in the Advocate, a LGBT news publication, this month. ""In addition to shooting for studios, most porn stars regularly create their own content -- either for their own websites, on webcams, or in partnership with studios."" Prop 60 would apply to any commercial pornography produced in California, in traditional films and on the web. Dr. Chauntelle Tibbals, a sociologist who studies the adult film industry, said the percentage of workers who have a financial stake in adult content they contribute to ""is certainly very high,"" though she said there’s no accepted estimate. Advances in technology and distribution, she said, have allowed more workers to share in the financial success of their content. ""Everyone from webcam models to agents may have a financial stake in a single piece of content,"" Tibbals added. Supporters of Prop 60, however, maintain the claim about workers being exposed to lawsuits is deceptive. ""The only people who can get sued (under Prop 60) are producers,"" said Rick Taylor, who manages the Yes on 60 campaign. ""Some actors and actresses are producers. If they’re breaking the law, they’re going to potentially get sued."" Taylor said the measure’s goal is to bolster worker protections and public health, and that it doesn’t matter what percentage of performers have a financial stake in the films. Our ruling Opponents of California’s Prop 60, which would require condom use in adult films, recently claimed it would put ""workers in the adult film industry at risk for lawsuits and harassment."" The statement is partially accurate: Some adult film workers, and perhaps a growing share, could face lawsuits if they have a financial interest in the content they work on. But Prop 60 does not specify what constitutes a financial interest. Ultimately, it may be up to the courts to decide. Importantly, the claim by the opponents makes no mention that only workers with a monetary stake in the films would be liable and only after a complaint process plays out. Those who are independent contractors would face no legal action. The statement leaves out this key context and gives the impression that any or all workers could face lawsuits.

James Woods says Dallas Cowboys can't honor dead officers with helmet decals
","After San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick didn’t stand during the playing of the national anthem before a game, actor James Woods chided the NFL over a decal that hasn’t been approved for Dallas Cowboys helmets. On Aug. 27, 2016, Woods tweeted: ""Kaepernick doesn’t stand for the national anthem, Rams players can walk onto the field with their hands up for the ‘hands up, don’t shoot,’ and other players can wear t-shirts saying I can’t breathe. But the Dallas Cowboys can’t put a sticker on their helmets for the 5 police officers who were killed. Way to go NFL…."" We wondered if the actor stuck to the facts. Woods posted his tweet after Kaepernick didn’t join others standing during the anthem before his team’s Aug. 26, 2016, preseason game against the Green Bay Packers. Afterward, Kaepernick said: ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color. To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" Woods otherwise referred to five Rams players raising their arms in support of protests in Ferguson, Mo., during player introductions before a Nov. 30, 2014, game. The NFL didn’t discipline the players; spokesman Brian McCarthy told CNN: ""We respect and understand the concerns of all individuals who have expressed views on this tragic situation."" And the decal? After the July 7, 2016, shooting deaths of five Dallas police officers, the Dallas Morning News reported, Cowboys officials led by tight end Jason Witten honored surviving family members at the Cowboys training camp in Oxnard, Calif., in part with players entering the field arm in arm with officers. The newspaper said in a July 30, 2016, news story: ""The idea to come out arm-in-arm belonged to Witten. So did the idea to wear a patch on their helmets in this camp that reads Arm in Arm. The Cowboys have asked the NFL if they can wear that patch on their helmets this season. Discussions are ongoing."" Eleven days later, Stephen Jones, the team’s executive vice president, told reporters that NFL officials had told the Cowboys that players couldn’t wear the Arm in Arm decal during preseason or regular-season games--though the decals could remain on helmets during training camp practices, according to an Aug. 11, 2016, News story, which said the Cowboys had placed the decal on the back of each helmet after the ceremony initiated by Witten. Jones said then: ""Everyone has to be uniform with the league and the other 31 teams. We respect their decision."" We spotted Section 4, Article 1 of the league rules stating: ""All visible items worn on game day by players must be issued by the club or the League, or, if from outside sources, must have approval in advance by the League office."" More directly, Section 8 of the rules states that on game days, items ""to celebrate anniversaries or memorable events, or to honor or commemorate individuals, such as helmet decals, and arm bands and jersey patches on players’ uniforms, are prohibited unless approved in advance by the League office."" (The rules also bar any ""detachable kicking toe."" Now you know.) And what is allowed? ""All such items approved by the League office, if any, must relate to team or League events or personages,"" the rule says. ""The League will not grant permission for any club or player to wear, display, or otherwise convey messages, through helmet decals, arm bands, jersey patches, or other items affixed to game uniforms or equipment, which relate to political activities or causes, other non-football events, causes or campaigns, or charitable causes or campaigns. Further, any such approved items must be modest in size, tasteful, non-commercial, and non-controversial; must not be worn for more than one football season; and if approved for use by a specific team, must not be worn by players on other teams in the League."" We asked Rich Dalrymple, a Cowboys spokesman, about Woods’ tweet. He didn’t speak to its accuracy other than to share news stories on the decal’s debut and the league decision not to allow the decals to be worn during games. Dalrymple said the request and denial occurred by telephone. Before our clock ran out, our attempts to query the NFL about the decals and Woods’ tweet didn’t draw a whistle--or any response. Our ruling In a tweet, Woods said the ""Dallas Cowboys can’t put a sticker on their helmets for the 5 police officers who were killed."" NFL rules give the league control over decals on helmets which must relate to team or league ""events or personages."" This limit likely explains the league’s disapproval of the decals honoring the felled officers. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Hillary Clinton correct that Austin's Alex Jones said no one died at Sandy Hook Elementary
","Suggesting connections between right-wing hate groups and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton brought up talk-show host Alex Jones, a Texas-based pro-Trump conspiracy theorist who runs InfoWars.com. Jones, Clinton declared Aug. 25, 2016, ""even said, and this really just is so disgusting, he even said the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there. I don’t know what happens in somebody’s mind or how dark their heart must be to say things like that."" The same day, Jones disputed Clinton’s statement, telling viewers of his Austin-based program that Clinton ""lied, not only to the U.S. but the world... that I say that no children died at Sandy Hook and they were all actors. I’ve never said any of those things."" A moment later, Jones went on: ""They can’t find anywhere where I have said that I know the kids killed at Sandy Hook were actors or that it didn’t happen"" and furthermore, he said, he’s been criticized by conspiracy theorists who maintain the Sandy Hook events were fake--""because I don’t buy into that."" We were curious who was right, so we put Clinton’s statement to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. First, this background: 20 children and six adults died at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, Dec. 14, 2012, at the hands of gun-carrying Adam Lanza, 20. Lanza had killed his mother at home before the school shooting, and then killed himself at the school as officers closed in. After her speech, Clinton’s campaign offered as backup to its claim about Jones and Sandy Hook part of its background paper quoting a June 23, 2016, story in the New Yorker magazine. The story said Jones incidentally had Trump on his program hours before the San Bernardino, Calif., shootings and Jones then ""praised Trump, claiming that ninety per cent of his listeners were Trump supporters, and Trump had returned the favor, saying, ‘Your reputation is amazing. I will not let you down,’"" the story said, going on to say Jones had historically insisted various national tragedies were inside jobs and, reporter William Finnegan wrote, ""Jones believes that no one was actually hurt at Sandy Hook — those were actors."" An embedded link in the story points to a video snippet likely excerpted, we determined, from the second hour of Jones’ Jan. 13, 2015 show in which Jones was asked by a caller if he thinks that after Sandy Hook, there’s a ""new level of sophistication"" to authorities planting ""flimsy evidence"" on sites that ""get everybody talking, going in the wrong direction"" after incidents. Jones replied: ""Yeah, when you’re trying to decipher cloak and dagger dirty tricks, it’s pretty hard to do. It’s just that then you learn that they were funded by western funding. Then you learn that it was the same (inaudible) connection, underwear bomber. Then those are big red flags that they were patsy provocateurs. The classic MO has been followed. ""And then yeah, it kind of becomes a red herring to say the whole thing was staged--because they have staged events before. But then you learn the school had been closed and reopened, and you’ve got video of the kids going in circles in and out of the building, and they don’t call the rescue choppers for two hours, then they tear the building down and seal it, and they get caught using blue screens and a email by Bloomberg comes out in a lawsuit where he’s telling his people to get ready in the next 24 hours to capitalize on a shooting. ""Yeah, so, Sandy Hook is a synthetic completely fake with actors, in my view, manufactured. I couldn’t believe it at first. I knew they had actors there, clearly, but I thought they killed some real kids. And it just shows how bold they are, that they clearly used actors. I mean they even ended up using photos of kids killed in mass shootings here in a fake mass shooting in Turkey -- so yeah, or Pakistan. The sky is now the limit. I appreciate your call."" Also, a web link below the video excerpt led us to check on Jones’ Dec. 28, 2014, episode in which the host, responding to a caller, called the Sandy Hook incident ""a giant hoax."" Jones elaborated: ""The general public doesn’t know the school was actually closed the year before."" Also: ""They don’t know they had kids going in and out of the building as a photo opp."" And, Jones said on that show: ""But it took me about a year with Sandy Hook to come to grips with the fact that the whole thing was fake. I mean, I couldn’t  believe it. I knew they jumped on it, used the crisis, hyped it up. But then I did deep research--and my gosh, it just pretty much didn’t happen."" We found a little more Jones’ commentary. In a Sept. 24, 2014, episode of the show, Jones cited a story on the InfoWars webpage that day headlined, ""FBI says no one killed at Sandy Hook."" Jones then said, ""According to FBI crime statistics at FBI.gov, no one died in 2012 in Sandy Hook. It shows no homicides in that town."" By email, we tried to ask InfoWars staff about Jones’ comments and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Clinton said Jones ""said that the victims of the Sandy Hook massacre were child actors and no one was actually killed there."" Clinton didn’t nail Jones’ wording. But the Austin broadcaster said quite clearly long before Clinton spoke that the day’s tragic events featured actors and also ""pretty much didn’t happen."" We find this statement True.

Mostly True: Donald Trump says 23 countries refuse to take back their natives from America
","In his immigration speech in Phoenix, Donald Trump said he’d buck a trend of countries refusing to allow people deported from America to return to their native homes. ""There are at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they’ve been ordered to leave the United States,"" Trump said, ""including large numbers of violent criminals. They won’t take them back. So we say, ‘Okay, we'll keep them.’ ""Not going to happen with me, not going to happen with me."" We decided to check to see if Trump was correct about the number of countries unwilling ""to take their people back,"" and whether they include ""large numbers of violent criminals."" 23 countries The figure Trump cites comes directly from a U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement document dated July 14, 2016. The document, which outlines a speech from Daniel Ragsdale, the deputy director of ICE, says that the process for removing those ordered to leave the United States is affected by the range of cooperation offered by foreign nations. As of May 2, 2016, ICE documented 23 countries that are considered ""recalcitrant"" in taking back their citizens. The list includes Afghanistan, Algeria, China, Cuba, Iraq, Libya, Somalia and Zimbabwe. This classification was determined by a country’s cooperativeness with the deportation process, which included factors like refusing to grant flights back into the country, the country's political environment and the timeliness of granting travel documents. Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, wrote a letter to Jeh Johnson, the secretary of Homeland Security, that also cited the 23-county figure. ""Lives are being lost, the public’s safety is at risk, and Americans families are suffering,"" Grassley wrote. ""It cannot continue."" Both Grassley’s letter and Ragsdale’s comments say the problem has been exacerbated by a 2001 U.S. Supreme Court decision. In Zadvydas vs. Davis, the Supreme Court ruled that the United States can hold convicted criminals only for 180 days if a country refuses to take them back. Grassley said in the fiscal year 2015, 2,166 individuals were released after being held for more than 180 days. Based on the Immigration and Nationality Act, the secretary of state is required to stop giving visas to immigrants or nonimmigrants after being notified the country is hindering the accepting of one of its citizens. Yet according to Grassley and the New York Times, that’s only happened once -- in 2001 against the nation of Guyana. Violent offenders So Trump’s number is well sourced. But what about his claim that these people include ""large numbers of violent criminals""? That’s harder to verify with concrete data. According to ICE statistics, 19,723 people living in the United States were convicted of a combined 64,197 crimes in 2015. The data notes that the number of convictions is higher than the number of illegal immigrants because one illegal immigrant may have more than one conviction. The top three types of convictions for people living here illegally are traffic or drug-related offenses. Driving under the influence, traffic offenses, and the use, sale or possession of illegal drugs account for almost half, 30,104, of all convictions. Violent offenses make up a smaller percentage of all convictions, but still, add up. There were 1,728 assault convictions, 1,347 domestic violence and 101 homicide convictions, among people living here illegally, according to ICE. There is no crime data specifically on people who were to be released back to their country. Our ruling Trump said ""at least 23 countries that refuse to take their people back after they’ve been ordered to leave the United States, including large numbers of violent criminals. They won’t take them back."" Trump’s figure comes from the federal department in charge of immigration and is accurate. But the second half of his statement about ""large numbers of violent criminals"" is harder to verify. Out of all convictions for anyone known to be in the United States illegally in 2015, 101 were for homicide while more than 30,000 were for traffic-related or drug-related offenses.

Pro-Republican PAC smears Ted Strickland with potty politics
","It must be some kind of election-year hazing ritual: the first ad that dunks an opposing candidate in the toilet. The National Republican Senatorial Committee’s ad, ""Flush,"" targets Democratic Senate candidate Ted Strickland in Ohio. In it, they attack Strickland’s fiscal management during his term as Ohio’s governor against a background of a flushing commode. ""And while Strickland proposed cuts for services for children,"" the voice-over claims, ""he wasted over $250,000 remodeling his bathrooms at the governor’s mansion.""   Did he or didn’t he? We’ll start with the first claim. Cuts for children Multiple calls to the National Republican Senatorial Committee went unreturned, so we are left to assume that the reference to Strickland cutting funds for children’s services is about his proposed budget in 2009. As governor from 2007 until 2011, the worst years of the national economic downturn, Strickland was faced with a $3.2 billion budget hole. The Columbus Dispatch reported that Strickland’s 2009 budget proposal ""would cut out state aid to food pantries, slash funding to community health centers, abolish the state preschool program for poor youngsters and reduce eligibility for state-subsidized child care."" The planned cuts were met with instant backlash, the Dispatch reported. In its final form, the budget resulted in less funding for services for low-income families, the disabled, Medicaid recipients and public libraries. But thanks to federal stimulus money, funding for education actually increased. It also allocated state funds for schools to provide all-day kindergarten. $250,000 bathroom remodel The ""Flush"" ad states that Strickland wasted a quarter of a million dollars remodeling his bathrooms at the governor’s mansion in suburban Bexley, Ohio, outside Columbus. But as it turns out, those toilets weren’t for Strickland or his family at all. They were built in the carriage house that borders the Heritage Garden on the property, apart from the main residence. According to an Associated Press story in the Logan Daily News, the new public toilets were constructed to serve the busloads of tourists who come to see the mansion -- an estimated 20,000 visitors a year. ""They are funded by private donations and $263,000 in taxpayer money,"" the paper reported. The expenditure wasn’t initiated by Strickland, but was set aside in 2006 under the administration of Strickland’s predecessor, Gov. Bob Taft. Taft’s capital budget allocated $912,000 for ""Governor’s Residence Renovations"" which included ""additional slate roof renovations, window well drain repairs, concrete porch replacement, and driveway and parking area surface replacement."" PolitiFact Ohio contacted James Miller, the former state of Ohio project manager who oversaw the governor’s residence, its staff, and all capital improvement projects, including the bathroom renovation in the carriage house. (Miller, retired after 30 years of managing government properties, now charters fishing tours on Lake Erie.) Miller said that before the five unisex bathrooms were constructed, tourists had to go into the main house and wait in line to use the restroom, often after long bus trips. The construction of the bathrooms included ""green"" features like solar panels and geothermal piping, and were built to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act for handicapped access, Miller said. More than half of the price tag for the restroom renovation -- $171,840 -- came from funding through the Americans with Disabilities Act. The other $95,695.70 was from the fund Taft established for governor’s residence improvements. Miller laughed at the picture the ""Flush"" ad paints of Strickland frittering away money on luxuries because he knew him as a ""real frugal man"" who got rid of the chef who worked at the governor's mansion.   Strickland did change one part of the master bathroom in the governor’s residence, Miller said. He painted it. ""He did it himself,"" Miller said, ""believe me."" Our ruling An ad by the National Republican Senatorial Committee says that while governor, Strickland ""proposed cuts for services for children"" and ""wasted over $250,000 remodeling his bathrooms at the governor’s mansion."" Strickland did propose budget cuts in the midst of the national economic downturn, many of which affected services for low-income families. But the ad suggests that the money used to renovate the restrooms at the governor’s residence could have been used to fund those services. In reality, the funding sources -- the Americans with Disabilities Act, and residence-specific dollars reserved by Strickland’s predecessor -- would not have been available for shoring up programs affected by budget cuts. The ad calls the bathrooms ""his,"" as in Strickland’s. But they weren’t -- they were for public visitors of the governor’s residence and surrounding property. The ad flushes the facts, so we rate it Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/db8e211a-122c-49d7-a5ad-4d0ead6b78e4",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B39640>],/factchecks/2016/sep/01/national-republican-senatorial-committee/pro-republican-pac-smears-ted-strickland-potty-pol/
"['Education', 'Illinois', 'Bruce Rauner']","
Bruce Rauner's school funding cut charge no more accurate today than in 2014
","In August 2014, as the race between former Gov. Pat Quinn and Bruce Rauner hit full throttle, no issue was more hotly contested than Rauner’s charge that Quinn had reduced spending on K-12 education as state finances spiraled ever-downward under his leadership. Specifically, the Rauner campaign cited Illinois State Board of Education data that showed school funding going from $7.4 billion in Fiscal Year 2009 to $6.8 billion in FY 2015. Rauner said that amounted to a $600 million reduction. Quinn, however, said his administration actually increased state-level funding during that time by $442 million. Whether school funding increased or decreased from FY 2009 to FY 2015 depended on whether you counted $1.8 billion in federal economic stimulus money in your calculation. Rauner did, Quinn didn’t. The issue never was settled, and seemed to disappear after Rauner defeated Quinn in the 2014 election. Then came Governor’s Day at the Illinois State Fair on Aug. 17. Rauner is not up for election this year, but his legislative agenda is. His campaign fund in recent weeks has given $10 million to the Illinois Republican Party to support GOP candidates who are running against what Rauner describes as a ""corrupt machine"" run by Democrats. Throughout the summer, Rauner has revived some of the themes that were a big part of his own, successful campaign two years ago. As he rallied the Republican faithful at the fairgrounds for the final charge to Election Day, Rauner reached back into his 2014 campaign quiver for another shot at Democrats’ stewardship of school funding in Illinois. ""They are strangling our state. They are driving jobs away. They are raising your taxes to the highest property taxes in America. They are building massive government bureaucracy everywhere, crushing our economy,"" Rauner told an enthusiastic crowd. ""They are cutting our school funding. Four times in the last 10 years before we came into office."" So here we are again, almost exactly two years from when this debate first erupted, only this time the argument is expanded to include all Illinois Democrats and narrowed to ""four times"" that they cut school funding. We decided to dig back in and find out if it’s true. Stimulus stigma Rauner’s office provided us with figures from the Governor’s Office of Management and Budget from FY 2000 to FY 2015 (the last year in which Illinois had a state budget) to illustrate the trend, and said the years referred to in the speech were FY 2010-FY 2013.  During those years, elementary and secondary education funding went from $7.32 billion to $6.55 billion. Clearly there’s a decline in school funding over that period. But was it the result of ""cutting,"" as Rauner claims, or because federal stimulus money ended? The Civic Federation, the respected government fiscal watchdog organization, took on the question through its Institute for Illinois’ Fiscal Sustainability in a report in October 2014: ""General Funds spending on education in FY2010 is shown in budget documents as $7.3 billion. But that number includes $790.8 million in federal stimulus funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Some analysts might deduct that amount to maximize comparability, which would reduce the General Funds figure for FY2010 to $6.5 billion. Based on that calculation, General Funds spending on education increases by $358 million to $6.8 billion in FY2015. Similarly, budget documents in FY2009 show education spending at $7.4 billion, but that amount includes $1.0 billion of stimulus funding. Deducting that amount results in General Funds spending of $6.3 billion in FY2009 and an increase of $522 million to $6.8 billion in FY2015."" The Civic Federation’s analysis is impartial and it offers no opinion on which version -- including stimulus funding or excluding it -- is preferred. Thus it scrupulously avoids making a ""cut or no cut"" judgment. But it affirms the credibility of assessing state-level school funding in the post-recession years without the emergency federal money, which was designed to offset the Great Recession’s economic downturn for school budgets. By that measure, the FY2010-FY2013 span we’re examining would see school funding go from $6.541 billion in 2010 to $6.55 billion in 2013. Not robust growth, but not the precipitous $772 million decline shown when the federal money from 2010 is included. There’s also a piece of evidence that both supports Quinn’s claim in 2014 that he increased school funding and bolsters Rauner’s argument about overall mismanagement of the state budget by Quinn as governor and, today, by the Democrats who control the General Assembly. Midway through FY 2011, Quinn and the Democratic majority passed a controversial, four-year income tax increase that raised the personal income tax from 3 to 5 percent and the corporate tax rate from 4.8 to 7 percent. The increase was intended to pay down the state’s $6.5 billion in unpaid bills and prevent cuts to core services, including education. ""The governor led that fight to raise revenue in 2011 and allowed us to avoid radical cuts to education,"" Quinn campaign spokeswoman Brooke Anderson told the Associated Press in October 2014 as debate raged over whether Quinn had cut or increased education funding. Debate over that tax increase was a major component of the 2014 gubernatorial campaign. To Rauner, it was yet another dagger to the heart of Illinois’ struggling economy, and a symptom of a Democratic party bereft of ideas to get Illinois back on track. To Quinn, it was a necessary if unpopular move to, among other things, preserve school funding. Two former state budget directors we contacted -- Steve Schnorf, who was Gov. George Ryan’s budget director from 1997-2002, and Joan Walters, who worked under Gov. Jim Edgar from 1991 to 1997 -- declined an invitation to weigh in on the main question here. But both said an important clue in making a ruling would come from examining how the stimulus money was used. If used to replace state funding missing due to the bad economy, as it was intended, then its loss should not be interpreted as a cut. If the state used it to fund programs or projects that would prove unsustainable when the money went away, Rauner’s assessment would be accurate. But improper use of the funding never was at issue. Rauner’s statements during the campaign two years ago and again this year dealt strictly with the numbers. Our ruling Rauner said of Democrats, ""They are cutting our school funding. Four times in the last 10 years before we came into office."" Rauner’s office said the years referred to in the speech were FY 2010-2013. While school funding did decline in fiscal years 2010-2013, it’s inaccurate to say it happened because of ""cutting."" In fact, as noted by the Civic Federation and in state budgets from the years in question, state-level funding -- which is controlled by the General Assembly and the governor -- increased slightly during those four years. Expand the years to FY 2009-2015 and the increase in state funding came to $522 million. Quinn’s record tax increase of 2011 is perhaps the greatest piece of evidence in support of Quinn’s aversion to cutting and in support of his claim that he boosted school funding. Illinois for two years has been a philosophical battleground in which Republicans, led by Rauner, have argued that Illinois’ abysmal unemployment rate is the product of 12 years of Democratic control of state government. Much of their argument has involved Democratic policies that they believe have made Illinois an unfriendly state for business. But in claiming that Democrats cut school spending in the final years of their hold on the governor’s office, Rauner resurrects an allegation that should have stayed buried after he won the election. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C23A500>],/factchecks/2016/sep/01/bruce-rauner/bruce-rauner-resurrects-school-funding-cut-charge-/

Democrat pundit: The Clintons 'take no salary,' get 'no personal benefit' from foundation
","Some Republicans have presented the embattled Clinton Foundation as serving one purpose: ""lining the pockets of Bill and Hillary Clinton,"" as GOP Chair Reince Priebus put it. Responding to such criticisms, Democratic pundit Hilary Rosen said the Clintons ""take no personal benefit"" from the foundation. She also pointed out the legitimate charitable work the foundation carries out, such as its programs addressing AIDS in Africa and storm recovery in Haiti. ""The Clinton Foundation is a charity where President and Secretary Clinton and their daughter, they take no salary, they get no money from it, they take no personal benefit from it,"" Rosen said on NPR’s The Diane Rehm Show Aug. 24. That’s a pretty wide gulf between the assertion that the foundation is just a front for the Clintons to make oodles of money and claims that they don’t get any personal benefit. It made us wonder: What exactly do the Clintons get out of the foundation? Bill Clinton is currently a member of the foundation’s board of directors, while Chelsea Clinton is vice chair. Hillary Clinton was a board member between leaving the State Department in 2013 through the launch of her presidential campaign in 2015. In the most recent year for which tax forms are available, 2014, the foundation reported that Chelsea Clinton worked 35 hours per week for the foundation and other related organizations, Bill Clinton worked 25 hours per work, and Hillary Clinton worked 20 hours per week. The Clintons don’t take a salary from this work, and they don’t receive any other direct monetary benefit. Other Clinton Foundation leaders take home six-figure salaries, according to tax documents.  The Clinton Foundation is a public charity that, as we have reported, allocates about 80-90 percent of its expenditures to charitable programs, while the rest goes to fundraising and overhead. (A quick aside: There’s some confusion over how much the Clinton Foundation spends on charitable programming primarily because the word ""foundation"" is in the name. Typically, a private foundation’s primary activity is grantmaking, giving money to charities who actually do the work. But the Clinton Foundation operates as a public charity in that they run many of their programs themselves. The Clintons also have a traditional private foundation, the Clinton Family Foundation.) So the Clintons don’t receive compensation from the foundation. However, you can make a case that they have received some indirect personal benefits. This is not to say that any of these benefits are unethical or improper. Experts on nonprofit ethics told us these are pretty standard, and they haven’t seen anything reported about the Clinton Foundation that proves corruption. Still, it’s worth reviewing the limited types of benefits that the Clintons do get. Public relations The most obvious, outward-facing benefit for the Clintons is notoriety and media attention. The organization got off the ground in 2001, the year Bill Clinton left the White House. During the periods when he or Hillary were not in or running for office, the foundation kept the family in the public eye — and more often for good reasons, rather than scandalous ones (at least up until the past year or so, when Clinton launched her 2016 campaign and the foundation faced more intense scrutiny). Throughout its existence, the Clinton Foundation has received attention for its work to make AIDS medication more accessible in Africa, efforts to combat climate change, establishing a business mentoring program, writing school food guidelines, and more. Every fall, Bill Clinton and his family receive a spate of press as the stars of the annual Clinton Global Initiative, a networking conference for wealthy philanthropic donors. Chelsea Clinton has embraced her role as a public face of the organization. ""It does continue to draw attention to the work they do as family and individuals throughout the world,"" said Ann Skeet, director of leadership ethics at Santa Clara University’s Markkula Center for Applied Ethics. ""At a minimum, it is good public relations."" When the Internal Revenue Service evaluates charities applying for tax-exempt status, which the foundation has, it wants to ensure that the organization is set up to provide a public benefit rather than serve private financial desires, Skeet said. There’s nothing improper about the Clintons taking advantage of their public image in this role, as long as it goes toward that public benefit. Another big benefit: The Clintons’ role as high-dollar fundraisers for the foundation also enabled them to maintain relationships with wealthy and powerful individuals, including many who are also involved in the Democratic Party. There are some crossover big money donors, such as Fred Eychaner, Haim Saban and Daniel Abraham. (Republicans have been involved in the foundation, too; Mitt Romney spoke at the 2012 Clinton Global Initiative amid his run for the White House.) The Clintons have also received some indirect monetary benefits from their charitable work, though none of this money came from the foundation’s coffers. Bill Clinton wrote a book in 2007 called Giving, for which he received an advance of about $5 million, according to the New York Times. The book was about charitable work and so is, in part, based on his work with the Clinton Foundation. Similarly, he has earned hundreds of thousands of dollars delivering numerous speeches where he talks about his Clinton Foundation work. For example, Samsung Electronics paid Bill Clinton $450,000 to deliver the keynote address at the 2013 Consumer Electronics Show, during which he talked about how technology has affected his work in the developing world through the Clinton Foundation. Samsung has also donated between $100,000 and $250,000 to the foundation. Experts also pointed out that the Clintons have donated to their own charity, and those donations would be tax-deductible. Bill and Hillary Clinton have donated millions to their private philanthropy, the Clinton Family Foundation, which has in turn given between $5 million and $10 million to the Clinton Foundation. Chelsea Clinton herself has donated between $25,000 and $50,000. And foundation tax documents stipulate that the Clintons, ""due to extraordinary security and other requirements,"" often need to travel first class or via charter plane. A spokesperson said that in some cases, when the Clintons travel on foundation business, the foundation pays for their travel service directly. At least one campaign ad has been made lampooning Hillary Clinton’s travel on private jets. Chicken or the egg? This discussion raises a chicken-or-the-egg question: Do these benefits the Clintons receive really come from the foundation, or do they come from their already sizeable political capital? Before the Clintons started their foundation, they were famous for being the country’s first family. Absent the foundation, it’s quite possible they could command equally sizeable speaking fees and book advances. They would have access to the same members of the global elite. They would have the ability and finances to donate to charitable causes. Buildings would bear their names. Hillary Clinton would still receive hefty donations supporting her presidential campaign. In all likelihood, very little would change in the Clintons’ private lives if the foundation were to close, said Tony Proscio, a researcher at Duke University’s Center for Strategic Philanthropy and Civil Society and a consultant to foundations and large nonprofit organizations. ""It’s fair to wonder how much of a ‘benefit’ these things would be to Bill and Hillary Clinton, who are already at home in high society, more famous than almost anyone, and probably welcome to associate themselves with whatever good deeds they please,"" Proscio said. ""Are those ‘benefits’ as valuable to the Clintons as they would be to someone else? It’s debatable."" On the flip side, he said the foundation likely would not be as successful nor as widely known if it didn’t have the Clintons’ name attached. He noted however, ""There’s a glamour attached not only to the foundation but to the Clintons' participation in the foundation that seems a little self-serving."" The reason people start charities in their name and donate significant amounts of money often boils down to a desire to feel like they’re contributing to a cause they care about or to increase their standing in the community, Skeet said. These are, however abstract, a form of personal benefit. ""All donors to all organizations give for a reason you can tie back to personal benefit,"" she said. Our ruling Rosen said, ""The Clinton Foundation is a charity where President and Secretary Clinton and their daughter, they take no salary, they get no money from it, they take no personal benefit from it."" Rosen’s claim is correct on its face. The Clintons do not take any sort of paycheck, bonus or fees from the Clinton Foundation.

Roy Cooper ad attacking Pat McCrory on education leaves out important details
","Education continues to be front-and-center in the North Carolina governor’s race. The latest ad from Democratic candidate Roy Cooper features a teacher talking about how teachers have to buy supplies for their jobs, and how she decided to move to another state that pays teachers more. ""Gov. Pat McCrory talks about raising our pay, but he tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years,"" she says. ""Like over 2,000 other teachers, I’m having to move to another state so I can do what I love and make ends meet. Someone needs to fix this."" We wondered if McCrory really did suggest cutting education funding to the lowest share of the overall state budget in more than 30 years. First, though, we have to figure out what the ad was talking about. The state’s education budget is broken into three categories – higher education, community colleges and K-12. Since the ad is entirely about K-12 schools and the claim is spoken by that K-12 teacher, our first impression was that the claim was about K-12 funding. Cooper’s campaign told us it was actually referring to the total education budget. However, we believe a normal person viewing this ad will think it’s talking about K-12 funding. So we’ll look at both. Overall education spending North Carolina’s budget is tweaked annually, although the big-picture budget is set every other year, during odd-numbered years. In his 2015 proposal, McCrory suggested spending 56 percent of the budget on public schools, community colleges and universities in 2015-16, and 54.4 percent in 2016-17. It was that drop to 54.4 percent that Cooper’s campaign honed in on. They cited data from McCrory’s own budget that went back to 1981-82 and showed larger portions in all of those years. McCrory spokesman Ricky Diaz said the historically low proposal was because of uncertainty surrounding tax cuts. He added that the funding ""was always expected to be increased when the legislature came back ... after the state's revenue picture became more clear as the governor's tax cuts took hold, improving the economy and in turn, increasing revenue."" We should note here that the N.C. General Assembly did not take McCrory’s advice. In 2015 it allocated 55.5 percent of state funding to education for 2016-17, more than a percentage point above McCrory’s proposal. And in July 2016, lawmakers increased the 2016-17 share to 56.8 percent. And that 56.8 percent share is, furthermore, less than what McCrory suggested in 2016. His proposal that year would have given education 57.5 percent of the state budget. That would’ve been the highest share since 2009-10, not the lowest in 30 years. Neither of McCrory’s suggestions were adopted by the legislature, high or low. But the ad specifically said McCrory ""tried to cut"" education’s budget share, so it’s fair to look at what McCrory proposed instead of what actually passed. And on that evidence, the claim is accurate about McCrory’s 2015 proposal. His 2016 proposal, however, suggested the largest budget share for education since the recession. K-12 only Next we’ll look only at the portion of the budget spent on K-12 schools. In 1981-82, the state spent 44 percent of its money on K-12. In 2015, McCrory suggested a 2016-17 spending level of 37.8 percent of the budget. That’s a drop, but it was not the ""lowest budget share in over 30 years."" In 2008-09, 2010-11 and 2012-13, the budget’s share of K-12 funding was even lower. The 2008-09 budget was under Democratic Gov. Mike Easley. The other were under Democratic Gov. Bev Perdue. The first two were passed by a Democrat-led legislature, and the 2012-13 budget was passed by a Republican-led legislature. Per-pupil funding McCrory’s campaign pointed out that the budget shares for overall education spending and for K-12 specifically also fell while Cooper was in the General Assembly. Cooper served in the House of Representatives from 1987-91 and in the Senate from 1991 until 2001, when he became attorney general. From 1987 to 2001 the share of the budget going to all types of education dropped from 68 to 60.1 percent. The K-12 share dropped from 45.5 to 42.4 percent. So the same thing Cooper’s accusing McCrory of also happened when Cooper and his fellow Democrats were in charge of the budget. Cooper’s campaign defended his record, though. Megan Jacobs, his campaign spokeswoman, said education’s 60.1 percent budget share in Cooper’s final year in the Senate was ""almost 6 percent higher than what McCrory proposed here. It was also the highest it had been since 1993-94, which was before (Cooper) rose to senior leadership."" So both Cooper and McCrory oversaw budgets that gave a smaller slice of the pie to education. But both also oversaw increases to per-pupil funding – a metric experts agree is a more indicative measure of support. Cooper knows all about the importance of per-pupil spending; we previously ruled his claim that North Carolina is near the bottom nationally as Mostly True. And per-pupil funding – from a combination of state, local and federal sources – rose under Cooper and has also risen under McCrory. Let’s rewind 20 years to the 1995-96 school year when Cooper was midway through his legislative career. North Carolina schools got $5,090 per student, the equivalent of $7,916 in 2015 dollars. Cooper’s last budget was for 2000-01, when he was the Democratic majority leader in the Senate. Schools that year received $6,654 per pupil, the equivalent of $9,158 in 2015 dollars. For comparison, North Carolina spent $8,496 per student in 2013-14 – McCrory’s first budget, and a few dollars higher than the year prior – and an estimated $8,898 in 2015-16, according to the National Education Association. Our ruling Cooper said McCrory ""tried to cut education funding to its lowest budget share in over 30 years."" McCrory’s proposed budget in 2015 did suggest doing exactly that for the 2016-17 school year, although McCrory later adjusted his proposal in 2016, when his budget’s share of education funding would’ve been the highest since 2009-10. That’s a detail the ad leaves out, along with the fact that the share of the budget going to education also declined when Cooper was in the legislature. Since the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important context, we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097096AC0>],/factchecks/2016/sep/01/roy-cooper/roy-cooper-ad-attacking-pat-mccrory-education-leav/

Is Herman Cain 'pro-choice' on abortion?
","
Republican presidential contender Herman Cain is ""pro-choice""?

That’s the thrust of a flier that appeared on car windshields outside the Iowa Faith and Freedom Coalition’s fall banquet in Des Moines on Oct. 22, 2011. It was put out by two groups, Iowans for Some Semblance of Christian Decency and Iowans For Truth and Honest Government, neither of which appears to have a website.

The leaflet declared, ""When it came time to stand and defend the most helpless citizens in our country, presidential candidate Herman Cain threw the babies under the bus.""

As evidence, sandwiched between a picture of the smiling candidate and another of an aborted fetus, the flier provided a quote from Cain saying, ""It ultimately gets down to a choice that that family or that mother has to make.""

Cain, former head of Godfather’s Pizza, is known to be an across-the-board conservative, so we decided to see what his position has been.

The quote on the flier comes from an interview Cain did with CNN’s Piers Morgan on Oct. 19, 2011. Here’s a transcript of their exchange about abortion:

Morgan: Abortion. What's your view of abortion?

Cain: I believe that life begins at conception. And abortion under no circumstances. And here's why --

Morgan: No circumstances?

Cain: No circumstances.

Morgan: Because many of your fellow candidates -- some of them qualify that.

Cain: They qualify but --

Morgan: Rape and incest.

Cain: Rape and incest.

Morgan: Are you honestly saying -- again, it's a tricky question, I know.

Cain: Ask the tricky question.

Morgan: But you've had children, grandchildren. If one of your female children, grandchildren was raped, you would honestly want her to bring up that baby as her own?

Cain: You're mixing two things here, Piers?

Morgan: Why?

Cain: You're mixing --

Morgan: That's what it comes down to.

Cain: No, it comes down to it's not the government's role or anybody else's role to make that decision. Secondly, if you look at the statistical incidents, you're not talking about that big a number. So what I'm saying is it ultimately gets down to a choice that that family or that mother has to make. Not me as president, not some politician, not a bureaucrat. It gets down to that family. And whatever they decide, they decide. I shouldn't have to tell them what decision to make for such a sensitive issue.

So first Cain said abortion is allowable under ""no circumstances,"" but then he seemed to be arguing it wasn’t a decision for the government to make, which sounds pretty pro-abortion rights to us.

The next day, Cain’s campaign issued a statement attempting to clarify the point. Cain said he ""understood the thrust of the question to ask whether that I, as president, would simply 'order' people to not seek an abortion.

""My answer was focused on the role of the president. The president has no constitutional authority to order any such action by anyone. That was the point I was trying to convey. As to my political policy view on abortion, I am 100% pro-life. End of story.""

He went on to specify that he would appoint anti-abortion judges and oppose any government funding of abortion, including defunding Planned Parenthood.

""I will do everything that a president can do, consistent with his constitutional role, to advance the culture of life,"" the statement said.

Even if his explanation was a little clumsy, and did little to quell the controversy that erupted over what he said to Morgan, Cain's political history supports his anti-abortion stance.

In 2003 and 2004, when he was running in the Republican primary for U.S. Senate in Georgia, news stories consistently portrayed him as anti-abortion.

""An associate pastor of Antioch Baptist Church North in Atlanta, Cain opposes abortion unless it is to save the life of the mother,"" the Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote on Aug. 10, 2003.

In May 2004, the paper ran a story about his radio ads attacking his primary opponents, one of whom was accused of flip-flopping on the issue.

""He had the opportunity to protect innocent life and he didn't. He has been touting that he is pro-life, yet he votes for pro-choice legislation. If he is pro-life, he needs to vote pro-life,"" the Cain ad stated, according to the AJC.

Later, in 2007, when Cain was working in talk radio, the L.A. Times wrote a story about abortion opponents reaching out to African-American voters. The story said ""a political action committee run by black radio talk show host Herman Cain poured $1 million into edgy ads on urban radio. One spot contended that Democratic support for abortion laws is ""decimating our people."" It concluded: ""Democrats say they want our vote. Why don't they want our lives?""

Throughout this year’s presidential campaign Cain has said he’s opposed to the procedure, although he prompted controversy once before when he refused to sign a pledge from a conservative group to promise to end all abortion funding.

A June 21, 2011, Boston Globe story said he refused to sign it ""because of concern about separation of executive and congressional powers.""

We checked with a couple of outside groups -- one on each side of the abortion issue -- to see how they sized up Cain’s record.

The National Right to Life Committee posted this chart indicating Cain has promised to end taxpayer funding of abortions and is opposed to Roe vs. Wade, the U.S. Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion. And NARAL Pro-Choice America cites four examples on its website that portray Cain opposing abortion rights.

""Herman Cain is anti-choice. Any claim to the contrary is wrong,"" NARAL communications director Ted Miller said in an e-mail.

Our ruling

The flier in Iowa called Cain a ""pro-choice candidate"" who ""threw the babies under the bus"" by making a statement about abortion being a personal choice. He explained himself by saying he was answering a question about presidential powers, not how he feels about the morality or legality of abortion. On that, Cain has been consistent for years -- consistently anti-abortion.

Ron Paul says terror attacks have increased
","
Rep. Ron Paul, R-Tex., has made a name for himself by railing against federal government overreach.

After remarks at Politics & Eggs, a popular political forum in Manchester, N.H., one Granite Stater in attendance asked Paul to describe his foreign policy position. Again, Paul mentioned federal government intervention, this time our behavior as ""policeman of the world."" That activity, according to Paul, has cost America money, safety and created foreign enemies in the process.

Paul cited the animosity that our foreign entanglements have created, comparing suicide attacks against the U.S. and its allies before and after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

""Suicide terrorism has been around for awhile,"" Paul said.  ""There was a bit of it before 9/11, obviously, but if you look at all the suicide terrorist attacks prior to 9/11, if you equate that number, it’s equivalent to the attacks on us and our allies every month, compared to all the years before 9/11, which means that we’re under systematic attack.""

Really? As many per month as all the years before?

His campaign e-mailed us a list of articles and news stories before 9/11 with a list of four al-Qaeda plots and attacks against the U.S., including its embassies, before 9/11. Not all of the incidents listed were suicide attacks (the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center) or even carried out (the thwarted Bojinka plot in 1994).

The list of attacks post-9/11 provided by Paul’s campaign included 30 or more al-Qaeda actions against U.S. troops, foreign citizens working for the Defense Department, attacks in foreign nations in which Western tourists — including Americans — were killed, and suicide attacks carried out against U.S. allies, including Israel, Great Britain and Australia. The links ranged from October 2002 to January 2011, but the incidents were sporadic and not monthly. So what Paul's office provided didn't square with what Paul had said.

When we tried to get additional information, Paul’s campaign did not respond.

We decided to look for additional resources for a more accurate listing of the suicide attacks that have occurred against America and its allies before and after 9/11.

The University of Chicago’s Project on Security and Terrorism (CPOST), features a database of all suicide attacks from 1981 to 2011, which includes the location of attacks, the target type, the weapon used, as well as information on the demographic and general biographical characteristics of the suicide attackers.

The database, funded by the U.S. Department of Defense since 2004, according to Robert A. Pape, Professor and Director of the CPOST project, uses 1981-2011 as parameters because that's when suicide missions as they are understood today began.

""It goes back to the early ‘80s because that’s when suicide attack really begins,"" said Pape, who is also the author of Cutting the Fuse: The Explosion of Global Suicide Terrorism and How to Stop It. ""Before that you have people who kill themselves to avoid capture -- that’s different than killing yourself to kill someone else. Then you have the Kamikazes in World War II. …But in terms of the modern phenomenon – it goes back to the early ‘80s.""

Because Paul’s campaign specified al-Qaeda as attackers in their lists of sources, we searched the CPOST database for its category ""al-Qaeda vs. U.S. & Allies"" suicide campaigns from 1981-2011.

Pape said CPOST means by that category, ""Americans and those working with or for Americans.""

The database revealed al-Qaeda carried out 42 suicide missions against the U.S. and its allies from 1981-2011. Four were prior to 9/11, in 1995, 1996, 1998 and 2000. After Sept. 11, 2001, there were 37 suicide attacks.

With 37 suicide attacks in the 121 months post-9/11, clearly there are some months with no attacks. In the months when attacks occurred, they numbered from one to three a month. The maximum number occurred twice: in April 2007 and January 2011.

So the monthly levels of al-Qaeda attacks post-9/11 is not equivalent to all the suicide attacks on the U.S. and its allies that predated that date.

But since Paul’s campaign provided a list that was broader than just suicide attacks by al-Qaeda — some of them were not suicide attacks, and others, foiled plots — we figured they might have also misinterpreted which group Paul meant in his remarks. Paul didn’t actually identify a specific group. We decided to see how the data compared if we searched all suicide attacks committed against the U.S. and allies before and after 9/11 — not limited to al-Qaeda attacks, but also those carried out by Afghani rebels, Hezbollah, Iraqi rebels, Pakistani militants and Uzbek rebels.

With expanded parameters, the database revealed 1,844 suicide attacks against the U.S. and its allies —10 of which happened before 9/11.

The 1,833 suicide attacks in the months following 9/11, from the end of 2001 into 2011, occurred from once a month (Nov. 2002) to 48 times (July 2007).

We posed Paul’s claim to Pape. He said the number of suicide attacks committed against Americans and their Allies each month after 9/11 is substantially greater than the years before.

""What happens is, the more we put troops overseas, the more we’ve had this explosion of anti-American inspired suicide terrorism.

""A good way to think about that, the year before 9/11, the year 2000, there was one suicide attack against the USS Cole that was anti-American inspired and killed US troops abroad,"" Pape said. ""Last year, there were nearly 300 suicide attacks around the world, about 270 of them were anti-American inspired -- that is, against Americans or people working with or for Americans.""

""Even when they’re attacking Muslims, they’re very often attacking people directly for America.""

""We have troops in Iraq and Afghanistan, then on the border of Pakistan, that’s where the hotbeds of suicide terrorism are. They’re not happening in Bangladesh. The real hotbeds of suicide terrorism are exactly where we put the troops after we put the troops there, not before. …There was no suicide terrorism in Iraq period until we put our troops there.""

We asked Pape if it was accurate to say that ""each month"" suicide attacks against Americans and their allies are ""equivalent"" to the total that occurred before 9/11.

""Each month -- that would probably be about right,"" Pape said. ""It’s going to vary month to month, and the year 2000 is a good proxy for before 9/11. … If anything, he’s still sort of under-counting.""

To be certain, PolitiFact went through each the 1,833 suicide attacks that have occurred against the U.S. and its allies in the months since 9/11, tallied up the number of incidents each month since the tragedy, and found the median. The median was 18 suicide attacks per month—more than the 10 total suicide attacks against the US and Allies CPOST cited before Sept. 11, 2001.

So, like Pape said, Paul actually is under-counting when he suggests that the number of suicide attacks against the U.S. and its Allies each month is equivalent to the total attacks before Sept. 11.

""It’s overwhelmingly born out by the data, the truth is we just don’t like to hear this,"" Pape said. ""(Paul) is just pointing out an inconvenient fact.""

Pape said the suicide attacks of more recent years contain the significant months to compare.  

""In recent years, it’s more like the difference is between 10-25 (suicide attacks a month) around the world,"" Pape said. ""In Afghanistan and much less now in Iraq, as we’ve pulled our troops out, the suicide attacks are falling like a rock.""

Our ruling:

Whether Paul meant al-Qaeda suicide attacks only, or all groups who have executed suicide campaigns against the U.S. and its allies, was unclear. Either way, the number of suicide attacks against the U.S. and its allies since 9/11 is not ""equivalent"" to the total before 9/11. The average number each month is actually greater than the total number that predated that day, so Paul is actually understating the magnitude. And the data support his underlying point that the number of attacks since Sept. 11, 2011, has grown. We rate Paul's claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C24B700>],/factchecks/2011/oct/24/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-terror-attacks-have-increased/
"['Economy', 'Florida', 'Alan Grayson']","
Alan Grayson's defense of Occupy Wall Street is impassioned, but is it accurate?
","
Alan Grayson, an Orlando Democrat and former U.S. Representative running to reclaim a seat in 2012, emerged a big-time supporter of the Occupy Wall Street movement after appearing on HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher on Oct. 7, 2011.

A couple of Maher's panelists, and even Maher himself, mocked the protesters for their worrisome bathroom situation, lack of media spokesperson, name choice, and proficiency (or lack thereof) in economics. Saying he was a former economist, Grayson jumped in, saying he had no problem understanding the protesters' grievances.

""They're complaining about the fact that Wall Street wrecked the economy three years ago and nobody's held responsible for that,"" he said. ""Not a single person has been indicted or convicted for destroying 20 percent of our national net worth accumulated over the course of two centuries. They're upset about the fact that Wall Street has iron control over the economic policies of this country. And that one party is a wholly owned subsidiary of Wall Street. And the other party caters to them as well. That's what they're upset about.""

It gets more interesting. P.J. O'Rourke, a political theorist and author, said, ""Get the man a bongo drum. They've found their spokesman, okay. Take your shoes off, get a bongo drum, forget where to go to the bathroom, and it's yours."" He got a few laughs. Then Grayson shot back with this:

""Listen, if I am a spokesman for all the people who think we should not have 24 million people in this country who can't find a full-time job, that we should not have 50 million people in this country who can't see a doctor when they're sick, that we shouldn't have 47 million people in this country who need government help in order to feed themselves, and we shouldn't have 15 million families who owe more on their mortgage than the value of their home, okay, I'll be that spokesman.""

Maher's audience gave Grayson a standing ovation. His retort popped up on YouTube and then spread through Facebook and Twitter. Liberal bloggers praised him for his succinct explanation. You can see the video clip here.

We decided to check Grayson's litany of claims about the economic plight of many Americans. (We previously checked a claim from Michael Moore that gets at Grayson's other major point, that no one associated with the 2008 economic collapse was arrested or indicted.)

We'll take the economic claims one by one.

24 million people in this country can't find a full-time job

A similar claim -- ""More than 25 million Americans are unemployed"" -- was presented in an article in the protester-produced Occupied Wall Street Journal, which we examined in a fact-check here. Grayson was wise to distinguish between the number of people who are ""unemployed"" and those who ""can't find a full-time job.""

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, 14 million Americans were unemployed as of September 2011, which is how officials determine the unemployment rate. We pointed out in our fact-check that BLS methodology has been criticized for not expanding the definition of unemployment so that it includes people who have stopped looking for work or who are working part time, even though they would rather have a full-time job.

An alternative measure called the ""U-6"" paints that picture. As of September, an additional 2.5 million Americans were deemed ""marginally attached"" to the labor force, and another 9.3 million are working part time but would prefer a full-time job. That adds up to 25.8 million people.

In our item, we pointed out the Occupy Wall Street Journal article described the expanded definition of unemployment, not the traditional one. Grayson's statement is a little low at 24 million but more precise in its definition.

50 million people in this country can't see a doctor when they're sick

Again, this is close to what is cited by the Occupied Wall Street Journal article but is a little different. That story claimed ""more than 50 million live without health insurance,"" and we found that they were almost exactly right. A U.S. Census Bureau study called ""Income, Poverty, and Health Insurance Coverage: 2010,"" found that 49.9 million Americans were uninsured in 2010. That's about 16 percent of the population.

While Grayson's statement isn't exactly the same, his point seems clear enough to us.

47 million people in this country need government help in order to feed themselves

Grayson is talking about what we know as food stamps, which has been called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program since 2008. The U.S. Department of Agriculture funds SNAP and the states administer it, sometimes by other names. The economic recession has forced more people into the program since 2008, and the numbers are climbing, according to this annual summary. In fiscal year 2008, 28.2 million people received nearly $35 billion worth of benefits. The program served 33.4 million in FY 2009 and 40.3 million in FY 2010.

The most recent participation figure, for July 2011, is 45,344,946 people, with the most recent monthly allotment per household at $283.68. That enrollment figure isn't the program's highest number, but it's just 65,737 people short of the May 2011 record.

""We are dealing with historic participation,"" said Regan Hopper, USDA Food and Nutrition Service spokeswoman.

Grayson's figure is pretty close.

He probably wasn't accounting for other government food programs, such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children -- better known as WIC -- in his tally. But that USDA program provides low-income pregnant, post-partum and breastfeeding women, as well as infants and children up to age 5, with checks for certain kinds of food to supplement their diets. WIC served 8.9 million in July 2011, said Regan Hopper, a USDA Food and Nutrition Service spokeswoman. Further, USDA funds school lunch and breakfast programs, which provide free and reduced-price meals to some schoolchildren, and provides food and money through its Emergency Food Assistance Program to states for distribution in food banks, soup kitchens and the like.

15 million families owe more on their mortgage than the value of their home

This housing phenomenon is also referred to as being ""underwater"" or ""upside down"" in mortgage payments. We asked a few companies that keep databases of mortgages and home loans, usually public records in counties, for the financial and property industries.

Seattle-based Zillow.com puts the latest figure for these homes at 26.8 percent for the second quarter, which ended in June. That amounts to 15.3 million homes. It's down slightly from Zillow's first-quarter analysis, which put the number of underwater homes at 28.4 percent, or 16.2 million.

We posed the same question to CoreLogic, a Sana Ana, Calif. firm. In a study released in September, CoreLogic reported that 22.5 percent of all homes with a mortgage were in ""negative equity"" in the same period. CoreLogic's number is roughly 5 million homes fewer than Zillow's, coming in at 10.9 million. The company found another 2.4 million borrowers at the brink of negative equity, or having less than 5 percent equity. 
You may have noticed some disparity with those estimates. 
Corelogic's data includes 48 million properties with a mortgage, accounting for more than 85 percent of all mortgages in the country. Zillow.com tries to provide an estimate for the country's total number of homes with outstanding mortgages, estimated by the U.S. Census bureau to be 50 million to 55 million. So part of the difference could lie in the 15 percent of homes CoreLogic does not cover. 
There are also estimation errors to consider, said Zillow.com chief economist Stan Humphries, particularly in guessing the value of homes and current outstanding loan balance. A difference of about 4 percent between the companies' estimates is not really significant, he said. 
""We think this is a critically important metric in understanding the housing market,"" he said.  
The point remains that economists have never seen housing values fall so low. Housing data is scant for the Great Depression, but Humphries believes the ongoing crisis outranks that period. He says Depression-era down payments were higher in the 1930s, giving folks some cushion as the crisis set in. 
Our ruling

Grayson's defense of the Occupy Wall Street movement earned him praise from the left-wing blosophere and pundits for its pith. No pundit or official  in the movement's first month had quite articulated the protesters' qualms -- high unemployment, expensive health care, poverty and underwater mortgage payments -- as Grayson did in 20 seconds on Maher's show. We examined each of his economic claims and found them accurate, point for point. We rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DDD400>],/factchecks/2011/oct/24/alan-grayson/alan-graysons-defense-occupy-wall-street-impassion/

GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker killed 15,000 jobs, Democratic state lawmaker says
","
On the day Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker held a forum n creating jobs, state Rep. Brett Hulsey, D-Madison, tried to steal some of his thunder.

Hulsey sent a tweet, made himself available to reporters and issued a news release on Oct. 18, 2011, all to highlight his view of Walker’s record on jobs.

In the news release, Hulsey declared:

""Governor Walker’s actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs.""

That’s an ear-catching claim.

It would mean that Walker -- who promised to create 250,000 private-sector jobs in his first term -- not only presided over a period of staggering job losses, but in effect took out 15,000 of them himself. 
Hulsey cited five sources to back up his claim -- three are estimates and two use hard numbers. 

We’ll start with the estimates.

1. Think tank estimate: 9,900 jobs

Hulsey’s news release cited a February 2011 report on Walker’s 2009-2011 budget-repair bill by the Institute for Wisconsin’s Future, a liberal research and advocacy group based in suburban Milwaukee. The bill, which led to unprecedented public protests in Madison because it curbed collective bargaining rights, made public employees pay more for their pensions and health insurance.

The institute said the higher benefit payments would reduce the public workers’ take-home pay and thus, their spending power, eventually leading to the elimination of 9,900 private-sector jobs.

So, these are not jobs already lost, but potential losses that would have begun since Walker signed the bill into law in March 2011.

Jack Norman, the institute’s research director, provided this example: If a typical state worker now takes home $70 per week less in pay because of higher payments toward pensions and health care, the worker might decide not to buy a ladder from the hardware store one week, not to buy a child’s coat from the department store the next and to postpone a dentist appointment the following week. Over time, he said, that worker’s reduced purchasing power means less income for those businesses, which eventually will reduce their work forces.

Norman said the institute has been revising its projections, and now estimates 16,000 jobs will be lost over the course of one year because of the budget-repair bill and because of spending cuts Walker made in his 2011-2013 state budget.

We should note that while both budget measures were proposed by Walker, they needed to be adopted by the Republican-controlled Legislature to become law.

Norman said the job-loss estimates were made using ""economic modeling software"" called IMPLAN. We found that IMPLAN is used by consultants, university researchers and government agencies to make various economic projections.

When we asked Hulsey if he had other evidence to back the 9,900 lost jobs part of his claim, he cited a March 2011 news article on a similar estimate made by University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Steven Deller. According to the article, Deller said 21,843 jobs would be lost within two years because of the budget-repair bill and Walker’s budget proposal. Like Norman, Deller cited reduced spending from public workers and public agencies that he said would result from Walker’s two budget measures.  

But that’s a narrow view of the economy.

We asked Thomas Miller, resident fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute in Washington, D.C., about estimating job losses in this way.

""You can’t wall off one limited portion of the population and decide that whatever is done to them is good or bad,"" he said.

Miller said the economy is affected by many factors, including the finances of state government. Walker essentially reallocated some of the state government’s resources by having employees pay a larger share of their benefits. In the big picture, he said, such a move, among other factors, could help employment.

So, Hulsey relies on predictive estimates in claiming that those moves will eventually kill 9,900 jobs. But there simply isn’t evidence that Walker’s actions, as Hulsey claims, are ""directly responsible"" for that many jobs being eliminated.

2. Train construction estimate: 2,300 jobs

Hulsey cited a November 2010 memo from the Wisconsin Legislature Fiscal Bureau that estimated the number of jobs that would have been created in connection with construction of a high-speed rail project between Milwaukee and Madison.

The next month, the federal government pulled funding for the project after Walker, who had not yet been inaugurated, expressed his opposition to it.

The memo, however, does not use the 2,300 figure and did not estimate jobs, per se.

Rather, as we reported in a December 2010 PolitiFact item, the memo estimated that over six years, the rail line construction itself plus economic activity generated by it would create a certain number of jobs’ worth of work each year. That figure ranged from 250 to 5,535 per year.

It should be noted that -- like the study of the potential jobs lost due to pension and health changes -- this looked at only one side of the picture. As we noted in another PolitiFact item, the estimates don’t take into account jobs that might have been lost due to more people riding trains and fewer using cars or other modes of transportation. So the advertised increase, on a net basis, may have been less.

But there is some ground for Hulsey saying that Walker prevented roughly 2,300 jobs from being created by blocking the train project. It’s certainly true that a certain number of jobs would have been created to build the line itself, and Hulsey’s figure is within the range of credible estimates.

3. Wind-energy estimate: 950 jobs

Hulsey cited comments by Denise Bode, chief executive officer of the American Wind Energy Association lobbying organization, in a January 2011 news article. Speaking about a bill proposed by Walker that would limit where wind turbines could be located, she said the measure would shut down 12 planned wind farm projects that could produce about 950 full-time jobs for one year.

Since Walker introduced the bill, some of the 12 projects have been canceled while others remain on hold as Walker attempts to work out a compromise measure.

So, there is evidence that Walker’s action prevented at least some jobs from being created. But Hulsey assumes that all 950 jobs -- which were projected, not certain -- will never be created and that is still an open question.

Now, let’s go to the sources that used hard numbers:

1. State government positions: 1,030 jobs

Hulsey cited a July 2011 fiscal bureau memo that said Walker’s 2011-2013 budget reduced the number of full-time-equivalent positions in state government by 1,032.

That’s a firm figure. But it’s not what it might appear to be.

Bob Lang, director of the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, told us: ""I would not portray these 1,000 (positions) as people who got laid off."" Rather, he said, the budget eliminated authorized positions that theoretically could have been filled -- but many had been vacant for a year or more and the budget ordered that they be taken off the books.

So, it’s not clear that anyone lost a job because of this Walker maneuver -- and in any case, certainly nowhere near 1,000 jobs were killed.

2. School layoffs: 1,000 jobs

Hulsey cited news reports of the layoffs of teachers and other educational staff in Milwaukee, Racine, Kenosha and Germantown, all in southeastern Wisconsin, and in Wisconsin Heights, northwest of Madison. The articles reported a total of roughly 1,000 layoffs in those school districts.

Hulsey said he attributes all the layoffs to nearly $800 million in reduced state aid to schools in Walker-proposed and the Legislature-adopted budget. But again, it’s not that simple.

In the article Hulsey cited about 519 layoffs -- including 354 teachers -- at Milwaukee Public Schools, the MPS superintendent said the layoffs were the result of a number of budgetary factors, not just the reduction of state aid. Moreover, MPS had laid off 482 educators in June 2010, five months before Walker was elected, which indicates that other factors trigger layoffs.

Similarly, the article Hulsey cited that reported the Kenosha layoffs said the layoffs were the result of federal and state budget cuts as well as a previously-negotiated increase in staff pay.

So, while Walker’s budget was a factor in some teachers losing their jobs, Hulsey cannot back his claim that 1,000 school layoffs all were caused by Walker.

OK, what’s the final assessment?

Hulsey said Walker’s ""actions are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs."" Two-thirds of his claim is based on estimates of the effect of reduced spending by government employees and government agencies as a result of budget actions taken by Walker. The estimates, however, don’t tie the spending reductions to actual job losses and take a very narrow -- some would say wrongheaded -- view of how the economy works.

Hulsey’s claims of perhaps a few thousand jobs not being created because of actions taken by Walker regarding high-speed rail and wind energy have some merit.  But his claim that the state budget killed 1,000 jobs appears to be off altogether.

In sum, Hulsey isn’t close to demonstrating that actions taken by Walker are directly responsible for killing at least 15,000 jobs.

Cory Booker says Newark shooting victims have high chance they’ve been arrested an average of 10 times
","
Many gun violence victims in the state’s largest city share a common trait -- a criminal history, according to Newark Mayor Cory Booker.

Booker, in a recent radio interview, said statistics showing the extent to which shooting victims are involved in the criminal justice system are ""startling.""

""We now sat down with Rutgers and have shown that if you are shot in the city of Newark, as the shooting demonstrates that we just saw, if you are shot in the city of Newark, you have over an 80 percent chance that you've been arrested before an average of 10 times,"" Booker said Oct. 13 on WBGO’s ""Newark Today,"" just days after a daytime shooting spree in a public housing complex in Newark’s Central Ward. ""So we know the players here. If you are getting shot or doing the shooting, overwhelmingly you've been involved in the criminal justice system and the correctional system is not correcting.""

PolitiFact New Jersey was also startled by the data. So, we researched Booker’s claim.

Newark spokeswoman Anne Torres said Booker’s ""statement should have been shot and killed, instead of shot,"" but beyond that he’s right.

The statistics come from a study Anthony Braga, a professor with Rutgers-Newark School of Criminal Justice is conducting, as a program called ""Operation Ceasefire"" is implemented in Newark.

David Kennedy, director of the Center for Crime Prevention and Control at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, along with Braga and Anne Piehl, a Harvard professor at the time, implemented Ceasefire in Boston in 1996, with the city’s police department. The strategy aims to reduce gun violence through targeted law enforcement efforts, social services outreach and community interaction.

Though Braga’s study is not yet completed or published, Braga said he briefed Booker and his staff on the progress of his research on homicides and nonfatal shootings in the city.

""The exact numbers are... 85% of 165 murder victims in Newark between 2009 and 2010 were known to the criminal justice system before they were killed (""known"" meaning that they were arrested at least once before the homicide event),"" Braga wrote in an email. And those ""victims, had, on average, 10 prior arrests on their criminal records.""

Braga said he determined those figures by running the names and dates of birth of the homicide victims through the state’s database of criminal history files.

Kennedy said that pattern of violence is not unique to Newark. ""This is the way the streets work,"" he said. ""The idea that ordinary people kill each other is nearly never true.""

""The folks who pick up a gun and kill another human being are the exception, even within an active criminal population and they almost always kill people in their same social networks. So they’re killing each other, in effect. Contrary to what a lot of people think, this stuff is not random. It’s not stranger on stranger,"" said Kennedy. ""It’s people that know each other.""

Our ruling

Booker said ""if you are shot in the city of Newark, you have over an 80 percent chance that you've been arrested before an average of 10 times.""

The mayor should have said shot and killed, but the rest of his statistic is on point -- and backed by the research of a Rutgers-Newark criminal justice professor.

We rate his statement Mostly True.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Texas', 'Josh Mandel']","
Josh Mandel campaign says Sherrod Brown owns Ohio's horrendous job numbers
","
Throw the bums out, because they’ve had enough time and this country (or state) is still a mess (if not more of a mess).

There it is in a nutshell: The case against any politician in office for the last four years or more. Josh Mandel, Ohio’s treasurer who aspires to be in the U.S. Senate, will use it repeatedly in the next year against incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, a Mandel spokesman says.  

The mess, of course, is the state of employment. Non-farm employment fell dramatically over the last few years, and although the trend is reversing, the recovery is painfully slow. Or as Mandel spokesman Joe Aquilino said in a news release on Sept. 28, 2011, ""Perhaps most staggering: during Sherrod Brown’s past decade as a D.C. politician, more than one out of every four jobs that has left America, left from Ohio. This is a shocking statistic. Sherrod Brown’s policies are not working for Ohio.""

Promising that this message will not go away, Aquilino said, ""Simply put, Sherrod Brown will own these horrendous Ohio job numbers next year.""

PolitiFact Ohio is all for ownership, as is the print side of this operation, The Plain Dealer. That’s only fitting, because Aquilino says that The Plain Dealer is a primary source for the statistic. So let’s check out the components of the   claim:

The jobs picture

The Plain Dealer on Sept. 5 published a Labor Day weekend story on Ohio’s loss of jobs over the course of a decade. The story focused heavily on a new report by Policy Matters Ohio, a liberal-leaning think tank that studies economic and social justice issues. Titled ""The State of Working Ohio 2011,"" the report examined a number of economic measures, concluding that ""wages are shrinking, jobs are elusive, and workers are being left behind.""

Aquilino cited this report as well as The Plain Dealer in his criticism of Brown. It is quite a day when a spokesman for a conservative Republican cites Policy Matters, and Aquilino appreciates this as much as anyone. Rest assured that Mandel disagrees with the group’s proposals to use tools such as more stimulus spending to turn things around.

Aquilino also pointed to a chart that went with the Plain Dealer story. The chart listed a number of metrics related to jobs and wages over the course of a decade, none of them positive for a majority of workers, and said, ""Between July 2000 and July 2010, Ohio lost nearly 600,000 jobs, accounting for more than one-fourth of all jobs lost in the nation.""

PolitiFact Ohio went back and checked the numbers with the Bureau of Labor Statistics. They were correct: Ohio lost 590,300 jobs during that 10-year span when the nation lost 2.07 million. Keep in mind that these were net job losses, based on the number of people working at given point in time. If 100 people lose their jobs at Company A, while Company B hires 20 people who were unemployed, the net job loss would be counted as 80.

Also note the time frame measured in the September 2011 newspaper article -- a 10-year period from July 2000 and July 2010. This made sense for the newspaper story because a number of other measures being examined also came from this period and were not yet available for more recent months, according to a reporter and editor who assembled the data. It was a way to make sure that all  the economic comparisons covered identical periods.

Yet job numbers change month by month. So we moved the time frame forward, comparing 10 years worth of net job losses from January 2001 through December 2010, and then through January 2011, to see if the earlier measure was an aberration.

It was not. Ohio’s job losses still represented about a quarter of those nationwide, with 570,400 Ohio jobs lost using one of the periods (out of 2.2 million nationwide) and 563,300 in the other (out of 2.1 million nationwide).

However, the job picture has grown a bit rosier as 2011 progresses, even if it lags demand as more people enter the workforce. If the comparison were made using August 2011 as the end point, Ohio’s 10-year job losses would be 407,000.

But wait a minute. Suppose Mandel, The Plain Dealer or anyone else wanted to compare Ohio’s job losses with the nation’s during that most recent 10-year period. Let’s see how Ohio stacked up: Ohio lost 407,00 jobs out of the nation’s loss of 531,000.

That’s an astounding ratio -- and if you used it (you should not), you’d say that four out out every five jobs lost in the United States came from Ohio.

How is that possible?

We asked BLS, and the answer leads us to the problem with these comparisons: Data examining one state’s decline over the years is useful when examining trends, such as Ohio’s loss of its manufacturing sector (a primary focus of the Policy Matters study and The Plain Dealer story). But simultaneous events in just a few large states can bring the state-to-national ratios down or up and skew the comparisons.

Take Michigan and California. Each lost more jobs than Ohio. If you compared their combined job losses during the most recent 10-year period available, their totals would actually exceed the nation’s job losses.

That would be impossible, of course, were it not for the fact that some other states were gaining jobs during that time. Rick Perry will gladly discuss what some call the Texas miracle and how Texas added jobs, although we’ll leave it to PolitiFact Texas to assess whom should get credit.

You can play with these numbers until your head spins. The point is that it really helps to understand what was going on elsewhere before using a single comparison to compare one state with the nation.

So OK, Ohio lost a lot of jobs. Mandel cited a September 2011 Plain Dealer story that, for reasons mentioned already, used a job-loss measure ending in July 2010. We accept ownership; the data showed a trend that was correct, and the raw numbers were accurate.

Is Brown to blame?

Should Brown ""own these horrendous job numbers,"" as the Mandel spokesman says?

We asked Aquilino to specify what Brown did that contributed to the job losses. In an email exchange, he mentioned ongoing controversies over the EPA’s authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions; over the National Labor Relation Board’s power to tell a company whether it may open a factory in South Carolina if it believes the location was chosen to bypass unions in another state, and over efforts to change labor laws in a way that would make it easier for unions to increase membership. Brown also supports raising taxes on millionaires. Aquilino said entrepreneurs fear that each of these will damage the business climate or hamper their ability to grow and hire. Brown has refused to join Republicans in pushing back against these measures.

We have little doubt that these fears are real. Business owners and managers have told as as much. But for the most part, these are prospective fears. While fear about the direction ahead may drive the election, Aquilino’s claim here relies on job losses as far as 10 years back.

Aquilino had more on his list: Brown voted for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, casting what many consider to be the single vote that enabled the stimulus bill to pass. Republicans said it has washed $1 billion down the drain, but many economists say it helped pull the country out of a tailspin. Whether it was properly focused or partially wasted or could have achieved more is what’s still hotly debated.

Brown also voted to revamp the nation’s health insurance laws, which Republicans say will create another drag on the economy. Although portions of it are already in place, the law’s main features won’t kick in until 2014.

Brown has voted against free trade deals consistently, saying they lead to higher unemployment, but he has been on the losing side. While Republicans say positions like Brown’s slowed passage and stood in the way of growth, the most far-reaching trade bills were Clinton-era deals for trade with China and Mexico. They passed despite Brown -- and during a time frame preceding the job losses mentioned in the Mandel news release.

Republicans have other raps against Brown: He backed the Dodd-Frank financial reforms, which required more stringent consumer financial regulation. Some businesses see these measures as creating bureaucracies that will stand in the way of hiring.

So Brown has caused these job losses, yes? No, says Amy Hanauer, executive director of Policy Matters Ohio. It might seem odd to ask the head of a liberal think tank to comment on criticisms made by a conservative opponent of a liberal senator. But the Mandel campaign credited Policy Matters, of all organizations, with pointing out Ohio’s big job losses.

What does Hanauer think?

""I think the Ohio job loss is primarily due to the recession, which in turn is attributable to the housing bust, brought on by excessive deregulation,"" she said in an e-mail. ""I think if we'd had more regulation of the financial sector we'd be in much better shape. In general, I'd view Sherrod Brown as appreciating the role of regulation in helping markets function better.  Secondly, job loss in Ohio, particularly in manufacturing, stems from more reliance on trade with China and other low-wage countries. Here, Senator Brown is clearly among the strongest voices for a different approach.""

We are not taking Hanauer’s side, nor are we taking Aquilino’s. The blame game requires deeper  analysis. For example, of the 10 years measured, Brown spent six and a half of them in the U.S. House of Representatives. It was under Republican control that entire time, with Dennis Hastert as House speaker. Brown and his fellow House Democrats simply lacked the power to pass anything the GOP didn’t want..

That changed in 2007, when Brown joined the Senate. That chamber’s Democratic majority has since taken the actions listed above. And if elections are about the future, voters will have their say in 2012 as to whether they think Brown or Mandel will offer a brighter one.

That leaves us here: Aquilino’s claim on job losses over 10 years is pretty accurate, given the above-mentioned caveats. But he links 10 years’ worth of hurt to a lawmaker who spent more than half that time in the minority party, and that’s where the claim overreaches.

BLS data shows that Ohio lost 190,900 of those jobs cited by Aquilino when Brown was a Democrat in a Republican Congress, affording him almost no power.

Aquilino backs up the claim by listing recent laws or policies supported by Brown in the Senate.  Yet the effects of most of those policies, whether negative or positive, are yet to come. The claim, while mostly accurate on the aggregate job losses, leaves out a considerable amount of information -- veering in large part toward inaccurate -- when saying Brown owns these horrendous numbers.

That renders the claim in its entirety Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976584C0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/24/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-campaign-says-sherrod-brown-owns-ohios/
"['Georgia', 'Occupy Wall Street', 'Public Safety', 'Kasim Reed']","
Reed sends mixed messages, but does not flip, on Occupy Atlanta
","
All the twists and turns in the Occupy Atlanta protest saga made the PolitiFact Georgia team wonder whether they amounted to a flip-flop by Mayor Kasim Reed. 
Sympathizers of the Occupy Wall Street protests took over Woodruff Park in downtown Atlanta on a Friday night more than two weeks ago. The following Monday, police officers positioned themselves nearby, and protesters braced for clashes or mass arrests like the ones that have taken place in New York City. 
The clashes never happened. Two days later, demonstrators cheered an executive order from Reed that let them stay in the park until Oct. 17 -- last Monday. 
The order’s expiration loomed. Once again activists prepared for a showdown. With hours to spare, Reed issued another order letting them stay for three more weeks. 
It sounded a little flip-floppy to us. We rummaged the office for our Flip-O-Meter to see whether Reed shifted his stance by letting Occupy Atlanta protesters stay in the park. 
We studied Reed’s public statements, news releases and executive orders, as well as actions and statements by other city officials who report to him. 
As far as we can tell, the first time Reed spoke publicly about the Occupy Wall Street movement was Oct. 10 in Chicago, as he appeared on a panel that included New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. 
It was three days after the Atlanta protests began. Reed was sympathetic. 
""I think that people wanted focusing attention and passion on jobs,"" he said, according to a clip that aired on WXIA-TV. ""I’m really OK with it because I think the country needs more passion and we need a big fight."" 
As Reed was in Chicago, Atlanta City Councilman Michael Julian Bond was back home helping set up a meeting between demonstrators and city officials, including Police Chief George Turner. 
Activist Tim Franzen attended the meeting. He told PolitiFact Georgia that Turner said that police would arrest demonstrators who break the law, but the chief did not give a specific time frame. 
Another activist at the meeting told us Turner’s message was less specific. 
""Word for word, it was that they [police] ‘would enforce the law,’ "" said activist James Turner, who is not related to the police chief. ""They made it seem urgent."" 
Bond, who attended a portion of the meeting, said he did not hear the police chief tell protesters they would be arrested, but he got the impression they were going to jail that night. 
That night, police mobilized on the streets surrounding Woodruff Park. Some rode on horseback. Others brought police dogs. Regardless of the chief’s actual words, it makes sense that protesters thought they would be behind bars before sunrise. 
The chief’s office referred PolitiFact Georgia’s questions to Reed’s representatives. Reed told PolitiFact Georgia the police chief ""never"" told protesters they would be arrested. 
The next day, Reed told the City Council’s Public Safety Committee that police staged near Woodruff Park to rehearse their response in case protests turned violent. 
Attorneys were reviewing the city’s options, Reed said. 
""Obviously we have some feeling about the right of people to peaceably protest and their legitimate concerns. But you all have passed a set of ordinances that I’m responsible for enforcing,"" Reed told the committee. ""So to apply them to one group and not to apply them to another group is creating real problems with us."" 
""[T]he posture of the city of Atlanta is we will not be moving forward with arrests at this time,"" he said. 
Reed issued an executive order the next day, a Wednesday. It said ""there is a compelling public safety need"" to suspend enforcement of city rules that shut down Woodruff Park between 11 p.m. and 6 a.m. Enforcing them would take too many police resources away from other neighborhoods. 
Police could make arrests to ""maintain public peace and good order for a reason other than enforcing park closing hours,"" it said. 
The order would expire Oct. 17, the date of the next City Council meeting. City code requires all executive orders to expire after the next council meeting, unless the council ratifies them. 
The order did not say police would arrest protesters who remained in the park after the order’s expiration. 
Still, protesters perceived this date to be an eviction deadline. Media outlets described it as one, but this interpretation is not clear-cut. 
That Friday, three days before the order expired, the mayor’s office said the date was not a firm deadline, according to a story by Channel 2 Action News, a reporting partner of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. 
When Oct. 17 rolled around, Reed issued a second, nearly identical order. It will expire after the Nov. 7 council meeting. Reed has not indicated what he will do at that time. 
Our ruling: 
Reed maintained through his public statements, news releases and executive orders that he will respect peaceful public protest and protect the city if demonstrations turn violent. 
The police show of force near the park Oct. 10 conveyed a more intimidating message than Reed’s words did, but it fell short of contradicting him. Both he and his surrogates gave themselves leeway to make arrests. 
The fact that Reed extended the time protesters could remain in the park is not enough evidence to say he flipped his position, either. City code required that the first order expire Oct. 17. The order does not say protesters would be removed after that date. Reed’s office said three days before then that it was not a firm deadline for protesters to leave the park. 
The city’s actions might have sent mixed signals, but Reed’s statements were carefully calibrated and the evidence indicates he did not change his stance. 
We rule No Flip.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ABB040>],/factchecks/2011/oct/24/kasim-reed/reed-sends-mixed-messages-occupy-atlanta-protest/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Tommy Thompson']","
Thompson says Wisconsin’s tax burden went down while he was governor
","
Battered by some conservatives for supporting tax hikes as Wisconsin governor, Tommy Thompson is fighting back as he launches his U.S. Senate bid.

When he announced his candidacy in early October 2011, the Republican signed a pledge to oppose higher income tax rates. Thompson said that over his 14 years as Wisconsin’s chief executive, he ""always fought to get the long arm of government out of the pockets of working families.""

""In all, I cut taxes 91 times,"" Thompson wrote in a campaign fundraising email on Oct. 4. ""And I’m extremely proud of the fact that I saved taxpayers $16 billion through my tax reform initiatives, and during my tenure as governor Wisconsin’s overall tax burden went DOWN.""

Thompson said he ""cut income tax rates not once…not twice…but THREE times! Once we started cutting taxes we didn't stop.""

We’ll tackle a variety of claims about Thompson’s record on taxes and spending in the weeks and months ahead, but thought we’d start with his overarching statement that during his tenure from 1987 until his departure for the Bush administration in February 2001, ""Wisconsin’s overall tax burden went down.""

That’s a hefty claim.

Thompson is pointing to a measure (""tax burden"") that goes beyond just the trend in total state and local taxes collected. Those collections roughly doubled during his time as income tax payments soared due to a robust economy for many of those years.

""Tax burden"" takes those total collections -- including property, income, sales, corporate and other taxes --  and divides them into all personal income earned in the state.  It does not reflect what every individual experienced; it’s a composite measure of the composite statewide tax bite, or burden.

The ""burden"" measurement is considered the gold standard for measuring tax impact.

On tax burden, Thompson’s campaign pointed us to a 2011 study by the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C.-based research organization. It put Wisconsin’s tax burden at 11.7 percent of the state’s personal income in Tommy’s first year, and down to 10.5 percent in his last.

That’s a noteworthy drop.

For perspective, let’s look at what some studies and measures show.

Thompson said the burden went down, but for whom? Most significantly, were there tax increases in the 12 years in between his first and last that added up to a cumulative tax hike?

First, a few important statistical notes.

The basis of all relevant studies we found is the U.S. Census Bureau’s estimates of state and local tax collections. The Tax Foundation study cited by Thompson tries to adjust the census numbers to account for so-called tax exporting -- taxes on oil in Alaska, for example, are collected there but paid in large part by residents of other states. The group also estimates tax collections in years the census does not do so.

Most tax studies we found, including state-by-state comparisons assembled by the nonpartisan Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, stick to the original Census Bureau numbers, citing uncertainties with estimating ""tax exporting.""

The two methods produce numbers that agree on much of what happened under Thompson, with some exceptions we’ll note below.

Neither reveal a consistent easing of the tax burden in the Thompson era.

Take a look:

The Tax Foundation study ranked Wisconsin’s burden the second-highest in the nation in 12 of Thompson’s 14 years -- but the state fell to a No. 7 ranking in his last year, fiscal 2001. The other studies showed some early progress but basically flat at No. 4.

Here’s a closer view: 
(In the most recent comparison available, Wisconsin’s total tax burden was 13th in most rankings based on the latest census estimates, but the Tax Foundation put it at sixth.)

It’s worth noting that ""tax burden"" includes taxes levied at the local level, not just by the state. But it’s the best guage of a governor’s  record because the state has mighty influence over local property taxes through state aid.

A final word on the figures. There’s actually a hole in the census data for Thompson’s final fiscal year, July 2000 to July 2001.

That’s a potential problem in judging Thompson’s record, because the drop in tax burden comes toward the end of his tenure. But researchers are mostly untroubled, saying the big income tax cut approved under Thompson took effect -- in part -- the year after he left. So Thompson should get some credit for the drop in the tax burden reflected in fiscal 2001-02, when Scott McCallum was governor.

""The tax burden fell during (fiscal years) ‘02 and ‘03, the last two years covered by the 2001 budget bill, which was jointly developed by Governors Thompson and McCallum,"" said John Koskinen, chief economist, Wisconsin Department of Revenue.

And don’t forget the Tax Foundation study does cover his last year, by estimating based on the previous year’s census figures.

Finally, using the 2001-’02 year as a proxy for Thompson’s final one, we crunched the numbers on his cumulative record -- not just comparing year one to his last year.

We found a net drop in the tax burden (9 or 10 percent) over the course of his time, depending on which methodology is used.

Our conclusion

Thompson told would-be donors to his Senate campaign that he’s ""extremely proud"" that during his time as governor, ""Wisconsin’s overall tax burden went down.""

The drop in the tax bite came late in the Thompson era, and some particular levies such as income taxes were on a wild roller-coaster ride. Further, data weaknesses prevent a precise judgment of the trends.

But Thompson referred specifically to the overall tax burden, a measure that is commonly cited in multiple studies. And based on frequently cited studies, our own calculations and observations by experts, his claim is on target with some clarification.

"['New Jersey', 'Health Care', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie slams health care reform as “a government takeover of health care”
","As Gov. Chris Christie proved last week, some lies never die.

Having endorsed Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Christie has been addressing what he considers illegitimate comparisons between Romney’s health care reform in Massachusetts and the national health care reform led by President Barack Obama.

The governor discussed the differences between the two reforms Wednesday on The Dom Giordano Show on Talk Radio 1210 WPHT.

""Secondly, what I’d say to the President is, in Massachusetts, we didn’t propose to raise taxes, as you proposed to raise taxes a trillion dollars to pay for a government takeover of health care,"" Christie told Giordano.

""Third thing is that ninety-three percent of the people in Massachusetts had private insurance then and have private insurance now. That’s not what’s gonna happen under Obamacare. It’s gonna be a government takeover of health care.""

By referring to the national reform as ""a government takeover of health care,"" Christie was repeating a claim that’s been debunked numerous times by various news organizations. In fact, our PolitiFact colleagues recognized that claim as the 2010 Lie of the Year.

PolitiFact New Jersey contacted seven health care experts from across the country and reached the same conclusion: the national reform greatly expands federal involvement, but the law is largely built upon the existing private health insurance industry. By no means is it a government takeover.

""I respect Gov. Christie a lot and like his style, but in this case he seems to speak off a talking point coming out of Washington more so than from a conviction forged by his own cerebrum,"" Princeton University professor Uwe Reinhardt said in an email. The governor’s office did not respond last week to requests for comment.

Now, let’s explain how the private market remains intact under the health care reform.

It’s true that the national reform imposes more government regulations for individuals, employers and private insurance companies. The reform also expands the Medicaid program.

Insurers must adhere to various new provisions, such as providing coverage for dependent children up to 26 years old and not restricting coverage based on pre-existing conditions. Insurers also can sell coverage through new insurance exchanges, but they must follow certain benefit standards set by federal officials.

But despite those and other additional regulations, the private health insurance industry remains intact under the reform, according to various experts.

""People will have choices of all these different private insurance companies,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Health Policy Institute at Georgetown University.

Richard Bonnie, a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law and an expert on public health law, said the reform allows for a larger federal presence in health insurance regulation, but not a takeover of the market.

""It left the existing structure in place and tried to bring more people under the tent,"" Bonnie said.

Based on projections from the Congressional Budget Office, the reform will allow more people to become enrolled in private insurance plans. Under the reform, the federal government will provide subsidies to individuals at certain income levels to purchase coverage through the exchanges.

By 2021, an additional roughly 24 million non-elderly Americans are expected to purchase insurance through the exchanges, according to the budget office. About an additional 17 million will be enrolled in Medicaid and the Children’s Health Insurance Program, the budget office stated.

Still, according to the budget office, most of the non-elderly population with health insurance will continue to be covered under private plans through their employers.

Timothy Jost, a professor at Washington and Lee University School of Law in Virginia, said the reform seeks to improve upon the private market, in part by making coverage more affordable through federal subsidies and by making insurance more competitive through the exchanges.

""It’s not a government takeover,"" Jost said.

Our ruling

On a radio show last week, Christie claimed the national health care reform was ""a government takeover of health care.""

While the reform gives the federal government a larger role in the health insurance industry, it doesn’t eliminate the private market. In fact, the reform is projected to increase the number of citizens with private health insurance.

We know Christie doesn’t like the national health care reform, but he should know better than to call it a ""government takeover."" That’s been proven wrong over and over again, making his claim simply ridiculous.

Rhode Island AFL-CIO President George Nee says reducing pension benefits for state retirees would be first for state, nearly all of the nation
","
One of the more controversial elements of the pension legislation proposed by Governor Lincoln Chafee and General Treasurer Gina Raimondo calls for freezing cost of living increases for people currently receiving a state pension.

The COLAs, in most cases now 3 percent, would be frozen at least until the system reaches adequate funding, which could be decades.

At a Greater Providence Chamber of Commerce breakfast on Oct. 19, 2011, George Nee, president of the Rhode Island AFL-CIO, suggested that such a freeze would be unprecedented, at least in the state.

""This is the first time in our state, and one of the first times in the country, where benefit reductions -- and the suspension of the COLA, in our opinion, is a benefit reduction -- has happened to people who are retired,"" he said.

Would the change really be as historic as Nee claims?

We're going to assume that Nee is talking about public pensions, not private pensions.

We immediately thought of  the City of Central Falls, where retiree pensions were recently cut up to 50 percent as a result of bankruptcy proceedings, making national news. (And in September 2009, the bankrupt town of Pritchard, Ala., stopped sending pension checks to its 150 retirees.)

But because Nee made his comments in the context of proposed cuts in state employee pensions, let’s focus on the portion of his claim that concerns other states.

Nee told us in an e-mail that benefits for retirees have been cut in three states -- Colorado, Minnesota and South Dakota. That, he said, would make Rhode Island ""one of the first"" to enact such cuts.

But according to Stephen Fehr, a researcher for the Pew Center on the States, those three states enacted COLA limits last year. Since then, New Jersey, Maine, Oklahoma and Washington have also frozen, restricted or eliminated cost of living increases for current retirees.

(Retirees in five of the seven have gone to court to overturn the action. Judges in Colorado and Minnesota already have upheld the COLA cut, Fehr said. Whether further challenges are successful will depend, in part, on whether the pensions were created through contract, through the state's constitution, or, as is the case in Rhode Island, through state law. A  lawsuit filed by Rhode Island unions over pension changes in 2009 and 2010 is pending in Superior Court.)

Limiting or eliminating COLAs for existing retirees would not make Rhode Island ""one of the first"" to do it, as Nee says. We'd be the eighth out of 50.

Now let's move to Rhode Island itself.

If the Raimondo-Chafee package were to be approved, would it be the first time Rhode Island has cut benefits to its retirees?

In 2010, the General Assembly passed -- and Gov. Donald Carcieri signed into law -- legislation limiting cost-of-living increases to the first $35,000 of retirement income. That would clearly be a benefit reduction to retired people whose checks will total more than $35,000 per year (a benchmark that goes up with inflation).

But that law did not apply to people who were already retired, or eligible for retirement when it was enacted. 
And although it required newly-retired workers to wait until their third anniversary (or age 65, whichever was later) to get their first COLA, workers were already required to wait until the third January after their retirement before their cost-of-living adjustments kicked in. 

Our ruling

Nee, referring to the current proposal to scale back pension benefits, said ""this is the first time in our state, and one of the first times in the country, where benefit reductions . . . have happened to people who are retired.""

We’ll give him a pass on the glaring exception of Central Falls, since he was talking about state plans.

Nor is it one of the first times for state plans in the United States. Seven states -- 14 percent -- have already done it.

But Nee was correct in noting that previous pension changes had no effect on the people who already had retired at the time.

And if the Raimondo-Chafee proposal is passed, it would be the first time that benefits for already-retired public employees would be cut, making that part of his statement true.

Overall, we rate Nee's statement as Half True.

"['Economy', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Barack Obama labeled Americans as 'soft'
","
Just before the Oct. 18, 2011, CNN Republican presidential debate, Texas Gov. Rick Perry's campaign posted a video online powered by excerpts from a recent speech he gave unveiling his energy plan. 
In the video, Perry also levels a charge against President Barack Obama, saying: ""The central issue facing Americans is a lack of jobs. There are 14 million Americans without work today. Our president has labeled Americans as soft. Well, I believe our people have toughed it out the best that they can, but they are looking for leadership and they are looking for optimism."" 
We wondered if Obama had really labeled Americans as soft. 
To support Perry's statement, his presidential campaign pointed us to a Sept. 29 Wall Street Journal blog entry about an interview Obama gave that day to a news reporter from WESH-TV in Orlando. According to the Journal blog, Obama said in the interview that the U.S. has lost some of its competitive edge and had gotten a ""little soft."" 
That comment generated a lot of criticism, from conservative bloggers and politicians alike, who saw in Obama's comment criticism of the American public. On Oct. 1, two days after the Obama interview, Perry told Fox News that it's not Americans who are soft, but the president. ""We've got some bad policies on tax and regulation in Washington, D.C., that are kicking people out of jobs every day,"" Perry said. ""That's the real tragedy."" 
We listened to the eight-minute interview of Obama by reporter Jim Payne. 
Obama's ""soft"" comment came about a minute into his response to Payne's question about whether the president shared his concern that younger Americans won't have as many opportunities as their parents did. ""Oh, absolutely,"" Obama began. ""And keep in mind that first of all, this is the worst financial crisis and recession that has existed in our lifetimes. I mean, you have to go back to the 1930s to see something like this, and so it's challenging for young people who are coming up in the midst of those kinds of circumstances."" 
Obama continued: ""But even before the financial crisis hit, one of the reasons that I ran for president was that wages, incomes had flat-lined at the same time that costs were going up. I think people felt that opportunities were becoming more constricted for the next generation. And that's why making sure that we're revamping our education system, making sure we've got world-class infrastructure, investing in basic science and research and technology, making sure that we are moving manufacturing back to the United States and that we're being tough with our trading partners, making sure that they're not taking advantage of us.""

And then: ""There are a lot of things that we can do. And the way I think about it is, you know, this is, you know, a great, great country that had gotten a little soft, and, you know, we didn't have that same competitive edge that we needed over the last couple of decades. We need to get back on track. But, you know, I still wouldn't trade our position with any countries on Earth. We still have the best universities, the best scientists and best workers in the world. We still have the most dynamic economic system in the world, so we just need to bring all those things together."" 
Reporters had different interpretations of Obama's comment, hinging primarily on timing. For example, a news article on the CBS News website described Obama as saying the United States ""had gotten a little soft"" before he took office. Other reports, including one by Fox News, interpreted Obama's comment as saying he thinks the country got soft and remains so. 
In an Oct. 3 briefing, White House press secretary Jay Carney told reporters that Obama's ""soft"" comment was part of his explanation of why he ran for president and ""why we need to take every measure we can to ensure that America remains the strongest, most powerful country around the world."" Carney also said that the comment pertained to political leaders in Washington and that previous administrations had not acted to ensure the economy was as robust as possible. 
Our sense is Perry took Obama's ""soft"" comment and amped it up for maximum effect. Saying the country had gotten soft in the past, as Obama did, is less immediate, personal and provocative than saying Americans are currently soft. 
Also, Perry's statement ignores that Obama also told the TV reporter that he ""wouldn’t trade our position with any countries on Earth"" and that American universities, scientists and workers are the best in the world. 
We rate Perry's comment Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC71C0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-barack-obama-labeled-americans-sof/

Mayor Sam Adams, city say streetcar attracted $4 billion in private investment
","
Elected officials love to talk about private sector investments in public infrastructure. It’s a way to show that they are on the job, promoting development and growth and jobs for other people. A prime example is Portland’s streetcar system, which opened in 2001.

In August, Portland Mayor Sam Adams gathered with others to toast the streetcar’s 10th anniversary. Adams highlighted the thousands of jobs created by the building and operating of the streetcar, not to mention the ""jobs created by that $4 billion in private investment"" along the streetcar line.

A news update posted to the mayor’s website, again, mentioned ""roughly $4 billion in private investment along the current line."" (The post has been updated.)

We were curious to know how the mayor got his figure, and whether it truly was $4 billion in private money.

Some background: The city broke ground in 1999 for a streetcar loop from Northwest Portland to downtown. In 2001, the line opened, later extending to South Waterfront. Next year, service is scheduled to start on the east side.

 We asked the mayor’s office and Portland Streetcar Inc., the nonprofit that operates the system for the city, for figures to back up the $4 billion assertion. In return, we received an April 2008 document that lists $3.5 billion of development within three blocks of the streetcar. It’s a widely disseminated figure used to pitch streetcars in Oakland and in Tucson.

Portland Streetcar Inc. then produced a list of projects since 2008 that add up to $735 million, bringing the total estimate to $4.2 billion. These include projects along the unfinished line; some have been started, and some have not.

It’s true that many of the projects on the development lists are private, such as the $300 million Brewery Blocks in the Pearl and the $150 million twin Meriwether condos in South Waterfront. But there are others that definitely are not private.

For example, Oregon Health & Science University’s Center for Health and Healing in South Waterfront cost about $140 million, and a number of long planned projects at Portland State University were estimated at $217 million. That’s $357 million right there that probably shouldn’t be listed as private-sector investment.

Also, the $295 millionLife Sciences Building is a joint venture between OHSU and the Oregon University System, and is financed with state bonds, the medical university and university fundraising. Again, we consider that public support, even with fundraising by the university.

More than half of the $50 million Bud Clark Commons comes from urban renewal dollars -- in other words, from taxpayers -- so that’s pretty much a public project as far as we’re concerned. The same goes for Tamarack, a$50 million mixed-use affordable housing complex in South Waterfront on track to open next year. Let’s say, conservatively, a combined $50 million should be knocked off the estimate.

The list also includes $31 million for Memorial Coliseum, $17 million of which would come from urban renewal funds. Again, that’s not private development money.

So where does that leave us? Well, we’ve counted at least $700 million in public investment. We’re also going to knock off $96 million because one project was counted twice, so really the $4.2 billion is closer to $3.4 billion.

Perhaps you think us nitpicky, but this is the kind of inflating that drives PolitiFact Oregon nuts. Public officials shouldn’t hype private development to help justify taxpayer spending, in this case, on a transit system that has its share of critics.

While we’re on the topic of inflating, we’re also not sure it’s fair game to include projects that probably would have been built anyway, such as the $65 million Fox Tower in downtown, half a block from a Max line. The list also includes more than $200 million in other projects constructed before 2001 downtown and in the Pearl -- two areas the city long had plans to revitalize. So it’s hard to say whether that much investment would have happened without the streetcar.

A study by the Federal Transit Administration analyzed Portland’s system and found that:

""Anecdotally, the initial stage of the system is credited by the operator with stimulating accelerated development of condominiums and specialty retail in the Pearl District, an area that was already undergoing some urban revitalization before the streetcar, as part of Portland’s urban renewal process. This area garnered substantial press in the late 1990s, when a major developer who had promoted the streetcar concept agreed to build higher densities when streetcar funding was finalized.""

To be absolutely clear, there have been hundreds of millions of private dollars invested along the line, resulting in more retail space and housing. We can’t say definitively how much of that development is there because of the streetcar. But we can knock off at least $800 million from the estimated $4.2 billion in private investment -- and that doesn’t even include projects that may be near the streetcar even if the streetcar isn’t the reason why the development is there.  

We presented our findings to Amy Ruiz, a spokeswoman for the mayor. She said in an email that he should have referred to ""$4 billion in public and private investment, or simply in investment,"" and that the online posts have been corrected.

Adams spoke of thousands of ""jobs created by that $4 billion in private investment"" along the current line. There may have been that much money total -- although it’s still not clear how much is directly attributable to the streetcar -- but it wasn’t all private. We rate the statement Mostly False: It contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Anita Perry says federal regulation made her son quit his job
","
Speaking in South Carolina, Anita Perry sympathized with a questioner who’d lost his job, saying her son, Griffin, recently gave up his job.

According to a CNN account posted Oct. 14, 2011, the first lady of Texas said: ""My son had to resign his job because of federal regulations that Washington has put on us.""

""He resigned his job two weeks ago because he can't go out and campaign with his father because of SEC regulations,"" she said, referring to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. ""He has a wife. ... He's trying to start a business. So I can empathize.""

Was America’s potential ""first son"" forced out by a federal reg?

The CNN post says Griffin Perry worked for Deutsche Bank, which is a global investment bank that offers investment, financial and related products and services to private individuals, corporate entities and institutional clients. CNN’s story also says it was unclear what SEC regulations Anita Perry was referring to, but the ""commission adopted a new rule last year aimed at limiting political activity on the part of investment advisers.""

That rule was described at the time as intended to stop employees of firms that advise government agencies on investing public funds from getting unfair edges on such contracts by making contributions to candidates with possible sway over who gets hired to give the advice.

According to an SEC press release, the commission unanimously adopted the rule June 30, 2010, or about 18 months into Democrat Barack Obama’s presidency. At the time, SEC spokesman John Nester told us, the commission consisted of an Obama appointee and four appointees of his Republican predecessor, George W. Bush.

The commission had proposed a similar regulation in 1999, according to a June 30, 2010 New York Times news article. ""Since then,"" the article says, ""the SEC has brought enforcement actions against investment advisers in pay-to-play schemes involving public pension funds in states including California, Illinois, Ohio and Florida.""

The adopted rule doesn’t bar investment advisers from helping a candidate or even making huge campaign donations. However, an investment adviser risks being barred from getting paid for advising a government client for two years if any of certain employees make more than a minimal contribution--at most $350 per candidate per election--to a candidate or officeholder who could influence which firms get hired to advise agencies on investments.

Also, the rule bars certain employees of such firms from soliciting contributions from others for a candidate or political committee, a practice known as bundling, if they also are providing or seeking government business.

Nester told us the rule applies to senior staff members at investment advisory firms and employees who solicit business.

Next, we wondered how the rule made Griffin Perry quit.

According to information on the ""Broker Check"" website, overseen by the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Perry was a registered broker for Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in Dallas from May 2008 through Oct. 11, 2011. Information on an SEC website says he also was an investment adviser representative.

We failed to pin down his duties, though. Deutsche Bank spokeswoman Sigalit Grego had no comment. Perry’s campaign did not respond to our request to interview Griffin Perry.

Deutsche Bank provides services for several Texas state agencies overseeing investment funds.

Managers of the Permanent School Fund, the state’s public education endowment, use the firm as a broker, according to the Texas Education Agency. The Employees Retirement System of Texas told us the firm provides securities lending services, which is a way for investors to generate more money from stock without selling it. And Howard Goldman, spokesman for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, said Deutsche Bank is among 40 brokerage firms that assist that system by executing trades for stock and other investment vehicles.

Inquiring into why Perry had to quit due to the rule, we heard from a Perry campaign spokesman, Ray Sullivan, that the son’s ""contribution of time and effort, and likely participation in campaign fundraising (e.g., speaking at fundraising events), would have likely triggered the new rule and resulting sanctions.""

By email, Sullivan said the rule severely restricts employees such as investment advisers ""from participating in the campaigns of incumbent state and local officials like Gov. Perry.""

""Griffin Perry was a financial adviser and is now understandably involved in his father's presidential campaign activities,"" Sullivan said. ""Therefore he could not continue to be employed by the bank without jeopardizing a new SEC rules violation, which would have banned his employer from certain business in the state of Texas.""

Sullivan shared an article by Scott Gluck, a specialist in securities law, in the Oct. 6, 2011, Hedge Fund Law Report, saying the rule ""applies to virtually all domestic fund managers seeking to manage money on behalf of public pension funds.""

The article says too that pitching in for a state official running for president can be problematic, specifying that  contributions to ""presidential candidate Gov. Rick Perry ... might trigger the rule.""

An SEC discussion of the rule when it was approved says the donation limit applies to donations to state officials seeking federal office ""not because of the office he or she is running for, but as a result of an office he or she currently holds. So long as a (state or local) official has influence over the hiring of investment advisers as a function of his or her current office, contributions by an adviser could have the same effect, regardless to which of the official’s campaigns the adviser contributes.""

As much as donations are restricted, we noticed that the rule still permits someone at an investment firm to personally volunteer for a candidate. The SEC’s summary says: ""A covered associate’s donation of his or her time generally would not be viewed as a contribution"" in possible violation of the rule ""if such volunteering were to occur during non-work hours.""

The summary also says the rule ""does not in any way impinge on a wide range of expressive conduct in connection with elections. For example, the rule imposes no restrictions on activities such as making independent expenditures to express support for candidates, volunteering, making speeches, and other conduct.""

Sullivan, reminded of this element, replied: ""Griffin will be involved in every part of the campaign, including raising the funds and volunteers we need."" Pressed again, Sullivan asked: ""Does the rule – in your view – allow Griffin to attend a luncheon fundraiser for or with his Dad?  What are ‘non-work hours?’""

We’re left not knowing the answers to several questions about the rule and Griffin Perry:  Did his duties involve soliciting clients? Was he intent on bundling donations or contributing more than the rule’s permitted amount to the Perry campaign? Also, does Rick Perry’s position enable him to influence the hiring of particular outside advisers by state agencies managing public funds? If not, the rule would not be a factor.

We’re left not knowing the answers to several questions about the rule and Griffin Perry:  Did his duties involve soliciting clients? Was he intent on bundling donations or contributing more than the rule’s permitted amount to the Perry campaign? Also, does Rick Perry’s position enable him to influence the hiring of particular outside advisers by state agencies managing public funds? If not, the rule would not be a factor.

Among experts on the regulation, Washington lawyer Ian Lanoff, former fiduciary counsel to the Teachers Retirement System of Texas, reminded us Perry might have pitched in for the campaign and kept his job because the rule ""permits an employee of a state pension fund investment adviser to perform political volunteer work as long as his firm doesn't subsidize the volunteer work he performs.""

Terry Nelson, a Wisconsin lawyer versed in securities issues, said: ""A large organization like that, they’re probably going to cut ties to people who bring them issues that hamper the business they can conduct in a big state like Texas, no matter what your name is.""

Indeed, Sullivan later emailed us that a lawyer for Deutsche Bank closely reviewed the SEC rule and ""determined that Griffin could not work on his Dad's presidential campaign and remain employed at the bank. The risk of SEC penalties against the bank were too real and significant. The bank and (Perry) determined that his resignation was the best course of action to provide him the ability to be involved in every aspect of the presidential campaign and not run afoul"" of the rule.

Our ruling

Given the unknowns, it’s tempting to say we can’t judge Anita Perry’s claim. It’s possible Griffin Perry could have volunteered for the campaign and kept his job. But we think it’s more reasonable to conclude that the SEC rule hastened his departure.

We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F70B40>],/factchecks/2011/oct/22/anita-perry/anita-perry-says-federal-regulation-made-her-son-q/

Sen. Marco Rubio said his parents 'came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover' of Cuba
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio sold his American success story as he stumped across Florida two years ago. His parents left Havana in 1959, he told a Panhandle audience, in search of a better life. He told a Tampa Bay TV station, a Fox Business host and Sean Hannity on Fox News that his parents came from Cuba at the end of the 1950s — when dictator Fulgencio Batista fled Fidel Castro's revolution. ""In 1959,"" he told Fox 13 and Fox Business. ""In '58, '59,"" he told Fox News. By Oct. 21, 2011, the biography on his U.S. Senate website still declared his parents ""came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover."" But interviews, documents and news articles in September and October raised doubts. PolitiFact Florida wanted to know: Did Rubio's parents come to America ""following Fidel Castro's takeover""? Doubt An Oct. 19, 2011, story by the St. Petersburg Times said naturalization records showed Rubio's parents, Mario and Oriales, became U.S. residents in May 1956.  At that time, Castro lived in Mexico after a failed 1953 attack on army barracks in Santiago de Cuba. Cubans lived under the dictatorship of Batista, who had seized power as he ran for re-election in 1952. The nation, which enjoyed high literacy, a strong educational system — even the world's fifth-highest number of TVs per capita — found itself ruled by decree.  In May 1956, the Rubio family would fly to the United States. Castro returned to mount his revolution in December. More than two years would pass before Batista fled on Jan. 1, 1959.  In 2006, Rubio, the young soon-to-be speaker of the Florida House, would recount the takeover: ""In January of 1959, a thug named Fidel Castro took power in Cuba, and countless Cubans were forced to flee."" To many, he seemed to count his own family among them. And in 2009 and 2010, he told reporters dates that made that possible. News stories called the lawmaker, himself born in the United States in 1971, the son of ""exiles from Castro's Cuba."" Some used a specific date: 1959. Story shift In September 2011, Rubio chatted with Miami Herald reporter Marc Caputo for a story about his upcoming autobiography. They talked about Rubio's parents' immigration from Cuba. Caputo, later recounting his notes, said Rubio ""struggled to recall the year ... and said it was in ' '57 or '58 or '59.' "" ""When asked pointedly: Was it before the revolution? Rubio said it was before the revolution,"" Caputo wrote in an Oct. 20 blog post. Caputo included the detail in his September story, saying Rubio was, ""the son of Cuban immigrants who left Cuba just before the 1959 revolution."" When we searched for news references to Rubio's parents, we found the new account differed from dozens of articles about Rubio's past, his own TV interviews, and his official campaign and Senate bios. And Rubio's bio didn't change. After the Times and the Washington Post wrote about the discrepancy, Rubio released a statement. ""The dates I have given regarding my family’s history have always been based on my parents’ recollections of events that occurred over 55 years ago and which were relayed to me by them more than two decades after they happened,"" he wrote on Oct. 20. ""I was not made aware of the exact dates until very recently."" Asked about Rubio's official bio the next day, spokesman Alex Conant confirmed, ""the dates were wrong."" ""We just recently became aware of it, and it just hadn't been updated,"" he said. (The site updated the evening of Oct. 21, 2011 to say: ""Marco was born in Miami in 1971 to Cuban exiles who first arrived in the United States in 1956."") Rubio learned the full story talking with his mom, Conant said, and looking at his parents' passports. (His father died in September 2010.) Instead of fleeing Castro's Cuba, the Rubios came to the United States for ""economic opportunity,"" Conant said. Our ruling Several times during his race for U.S. Senate, Rubio told reporters and voters his parents left Cuba in 1959, suggesting they had fled Castro's rule. In his campaign bio, and later in his official Senate biography, he said his parents ""came to America following Fidel Castro's takeover."" Even after he stumbled over dates with a Miami Herald reporter and acknowledged his parents left before the revolution, his official Web bio stayed the same. After two news organizations reported his parents moved to the United States in 1956, his spokesman acknowledged that the bio was wrong. It was updated to say, ""Marco was born in Miami in 1971 to Cuban exiles who first arrived in the United States in 1956."" That puts everyone in agreement: The original statement is False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EA8AC0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/21/marco-rubio/sen-marco-rubio-said-his-parents-came-america-foll/

Rick Perry says they cut property taxes by one-third in Texas
","
On the campaign trail in New Hampshire earlier this month, Texas Gov. Rick Perry repeated what has become a common battle cry in his campaign for the Republican nomination for president.

""We cut property taxes by one-third in the state of Texas while I've been governor,"" he told a crowd Oct. 1, 2011 at a ""We the People"" forum in Hampton, New Hampshire.

Perry has repeated the claim several times during his presidential run, and he also used it during his 2010 re-election campaign in Texas.

PolitiFact Texas checked it at the time, coming up with a ruling of Barely True, now known as Mostly False. But has anything changed in the years since? We decided to check it out.

As we discovered in early 2010, Perry is referring to House Bill 1, a tax law approved by the Texas Legislature in 2006.

In 2005, five years into his tenure as governor, Perry created the bi-partisan Texas Tax Reform Commission, which developed the proposal. And the following year, he signed into law the overhaul, intended to reduce property taxes paid to local school districts.

The overhaul did decrease a portion of the state’s school tax rate. It effectively lowered the maintenance and operation segment of the school tax, which makes up most of the school taxes, from $1.50 to $1.00 per $100 of assessed property value. That number met Perry’s claim of a one-third cut. But it didn’t translate to 33 percent lower bills for taxpayers, which is what we think most voters would infer from the claim.

In 2007, the first year the tax changes were fully implemented, the total amount of tax dollars paid to local schools, fell about 6.4 percent from levels in 2005, before the tax overhaul, according to the state Comptroller’s office. Yet, when including county, city and school taxes, among others, the total amount of taxes paid increased by about 5 percent from 2005 to 2007, reaching $35.1 billion.

Both the school tax levy and total property taxes continued to rise in 2008 and 2009. The amount of total tax dollars paid reached $40 billion in 2009. But the school and total taxes took a nose dive last year.

In 2010, the most recent data available, school taxes dropped about 1 percent to $21.6 billion, but that number is 6.8 percent higher than 2005, before the tax overhaul was implemented.

Total property tax dollars dropped back to $33.7 billion in 2010, roughly even to the $33.5 billion paid in 2005. Adjusting for inflation, however, the total amount of taxes collected fell by 9 percent, which is a little closer to Perry’s statement.

Still, these numbers don’t show the picture of tax relief that Perry paints on the campaign trail. Nor do they tell the full story either, according to Texas policy analysts.

Much of the tax increase can be attributed to factors including population growth and rising property values, analysts said. And voters and local school districts have contributed, as well, electing to restore higher local tax rates to better fund schools, according to Dick Lavine, a senior analyst with the Center for Public Policy Priorities, a left-leaning think tank in Austin, Texas.

The 2006 overhaul legislation left room for local school boards for a one-time restoration of up to 4 cents to the operations and maintenance tax without an election. Voters could return up to 17 cents to the tax rate, Lavine said.

""The vast majority (added to the rate) almost immediately,"" he said. ""About a quarter are now at $1.17. They’re back in the same situation they were before.""

From the beginning, these factors have clouded some of the impact the overhaul has had on the state’s taxpayers, other analysts suggest.

The tax reform may not have lowered homeowners’ property tax bills, but, in 2007, it did shave $7 billion off what Texans would have paid without the rate cut, according to the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, an Austin-based business group.

""That means the average Texan’s total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative,"" the association wrote in its 2008 report ""Property Tax Relief: The $7 Billion Reality."" The group said that number was a ""rough"" estimate.

""I don't think there's any question, it represented a net tax decrease for the state of Texas."" echoed Joshua Trevino, a spokesman for the Texas Public Policy Foundation, a right-leaning free market group. ""I don’t think that’s in question.""

Our ruling

Perry was correct if you only look at school tax rate, but his comment referred to all property taxes. If you look at total property tax revenue, Texans paid about the same amount in 2010 as they did in 2005. If you adjust for inflation, he's closer (it's about 9 percent less) but it's still far short of one-third. We find his claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809789A680>],/factchecks/2011/oct/21/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-they-cut-property-taxes-one-third-/
"['Jobs', 'Stimulus', 'Virginia', 'National Republican Senatorial Committee']","
National Republican Senatorial Committee ad says stimulus created ""zero jobs""
","
As President Barack Obama toured Virginia last week touting his jobs plan, Republicans countered that his previous effort -- the stimulus -- did not create a single job.

The National Republican Senatorial Committee posted a web ad inking Obama and former Gov. Tim Kaine, who served as the president’s hand-picked chairman of the Democratic National Committee from 2009 until early this year. Kaine resigned the post when he announced he would run for the U.S. Senate next year.

The 31-second NRSC ad has footage of Kaine strongly endorsing the president and predicting the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 ""will save or create 2.4 million jobs.""
Three people appear in quick order on the screen, saying, ""Zero jobs, zero jobs, zero jobs were created.""

Zilch?

We thought we’d look into this familiar claim once again, noting that Republican George Allen, Kaine’s likely opponent in next year’s U.S. Senate race, is featuring the ad on his campaign web site and sent out a  tweet heralding it.

Chris Bond, press secretary for the NRSC, told us the zero-jobs claim is not about the stimulus. ""The part of the ad you’re referring to clearly shows news clips about unemployment reports"" by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, he said in an email.

But we think anyone seeing the ad would conclude the zero-jobs claim is tied to the stimulus. The commercial makes no apparent reference to unemployment reports. It clearly mentions the stimulus, however. 
PolitiFact is no stranger to claims that the Recovery Act was a complete dud. In June, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, received a  False rating on his claim that the stimulus ""failed to get people back to work."" His office argued it was a broad statement that the Recovery Act failed to improve the economy, not a claim that no one benefited from it.

Echoing Cantor, the NRSC  later in June put out a news release saying the stimulus ""failed to create jobs,"" and that also received a  False rating from PolitiFact.

Texas Gov. Rick Perry said during a Republican presidential debate Sept. 12, 2011, that the stimulus ""created zero jobs."" He earned a Pants on Fire from our national PolitiFact colleagues.

There was also smoke in the air after U.S. Sen. Scott Brown, R-Mass., said in February 2010 that the stimulus ""didn’t create one new job,"" and after Florida Republican Rick Scott claimed in September 2010 while successfully campaigning for governor that the stimulus ""has not created one private sector job."" 

The zero-job claim is not credible for a simple reason: The stimulus did put people to work.

Virginia’s public schools and higher education institutions have reported the Recovery Act allowed them to create 996 jobs through the end of June 2011 and save 6,042 positions, according to Charles Pyle, communications director for the state Department of Education.

The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. For the quarter that ended June 30, the nation had reported 545,262 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the Recovery Act -- including 11,604 in Virginia..

The president’s Council of Economic Advisers, in a report released in March, estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010.

Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found:

• CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created.

• IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created.

• Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created.

• Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created.

Our ruling:

The stimulus may not have been the success everyone hoped for, but there’s an abundance of evidence it did create jobs and saved many more. Just look at the figures from the Virginia Department of Education.

The NRSC added its name to a list of Republican candidates who claim the the stimulus created ""zero jobs.""  When we asked for proof, the campaign organization provided none. Instead, a spokesman said the ad ""clearly"" referred to federal unemployment reports -- not the Recovery Act. We don't buy that explanation; the commercial is undoubtedly focused on the stimulus. 
Not one job anywhere? It’s a ridiculous claim and we rate it, once again, Pants on Fire.

"['Education', 'Science', 'Florida', 'Frank Brogan']","
University Chancellor Frank Brogan claims anthropology is part of STEM
","
Gov. Rick Scott found himself at war with anthropologists when he told a radio talk show host on Oct. 10, 2011, that Florida doesn't need ""a lot more anthropologists.""

Instead, Scott said, the state needs more graduates in science, technology, engineering and math fields -- shortened often as STEM. (To read more about Scott's spat with anthropologists read this blog item from the St. Petersburg Times.)

Scott's pro-STEM, anti-anthropology sounding statement produced loud opposition from anthropologists and liberal arts majors. It also resulted in a simple question from state Rep. Alan Williams, D-Tallahassee, to State University System Chancellor Frank Brogan.

At an Oct. 19 House committee meeting, Williams asked: ""Is anthropology a STEM?""

Brogan responded: ""It is.""

So if anthropology is STEM, and Scott likes STEM, but Scott doesn't like anthropology ... 

The conclusion of that sentence starts with whether Brogan is right -- that anthropology is a STEM field. 

And that depends whom you ask.

National Science Foundation -- Yes. The National Science Foundation considers anthropology a STEM field, according to Mark Fiegener, a National Science Foundation project officer. Fiegener said that NSF considers anthropology to be part of the ""S"", or science, in STEM. ""NSF considers anthropology to be a field of science – one of the social sciences, to be precise,"" Fiegener wrote in an e-mail. ""Consequently, when we report STEM fields in our statistical reports, the data from or about anthropology departments or students are always counted in the broad 'science' category.""

U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement -- No. Believe it or not, U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement has a list of STEM programs because the federal government allows foreign students on student visas who graduate with STEM degrees to remain in the U.S. for additional time to receive work experience. ICE announced in May 2011 that it expanded the list of STEM degrees -- but anthropology isn't included. 

President's Council of Advisors on Science and Technology -- Kind of. The council issued a report discussing K-12 STEM education in September 2010. They specifically excluded anthropology as a STEM field for K-12 education, but they also said it was ""appropriately considered STEM fields at the undergraduate and graduate levels.""

Florida Board of Governors -- No. The board, which oversees the state university system and selected Brogan as university chancellor, has designated 103 STEM undergraduate and graduate degrees but not anthropology. The board, working together with the state universities, re-classified the degrees in 2008. 

Our ruling 
At a subcommittee meeting a state legislator asked Brogan ""is anthropology a STEM?"" and Brogan replied: ""it is."" The National Science Foundation agrees with him, but his own university system and U.S. Customs and Immigration Enforcement don't. Brogan's response suggests that the answer is simple, but in reality it's anything but clear cut and he should have explained that. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809724AEC0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/21/frank-brogan/brogan-claims-anthro-part-stem/
