Do we have more women in the workforce than ever before?
","Is the United States at a high point in employment for women? The West Virginia Republican Party said so in a recent tweet. The party quoted the State of the Union address by President Donald Trump. ""’Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than ever before.’ -- @realDonaldTrump #SOTU"" ""Americans can be proud that we have more women in the workforce than ever before — and exactly one century after Congress passed the Constitutional Amendment giving women the right to vote, we also have more women serving in Congress than ever before."" - @realDonaldTrump #SOTU The tweet is correct about the number of women in Congress being a record, according to the Pew Research Center. Here, we’ll look at whether the number of women in the workforce is at a record high. (The West Virginia Republican Party did not respond to inquiries for this article.) According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s official source for employment data, the annual average for 2018 of women in the labor force was 76 million. That’s an all-time high, as this chart shows: However, simply counting the number of women in the workforce is not very meaningful, because this number almost always goes up from year to year due to simple population growth. ""Levels are generally not the appropriate form of measure to look at when examining this particular statistic, because it is influenced by the overall number of women that live in the U.S. – and since that number is rising, it makes sense that the number of women participating in the labor force would also rise,"" said Brian Lego, a research assistant professor in the West Virginia University economics department. A better measurement is to look at the percentage of women who are in the workforce from year to year. And this statistic undercuts the claim in the tweet. By this measurement, women’s participation in the workforce peaked in 1999 at roughly 60 percent. It bottomed out in 2015 around 56 percent and has slowly climbed up to 57.5 percent  in 2019. The West Virginia Republican Party cited a line from Trump’s State of the Union address in which he said that the United States has ""more women in the workforce than ever before."" The raw number of women in the workforce is higher than ever, but that’s meaningless because growth in population means that essentially every year brings a higher number. The more appropriate statistic, economists say, is to look at the percentage of women who are in the workforce -- a measurement that takes rising population levels out of the equation. And while that percentage is rising, the historical peak came in 1999. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FB7E00>],/factchecks/2019/mar/27/west-virginia-republican-party/do-we-have-more-women-workforce-ever/

Was the catalytic converter invented in West Virginia? Not exactly
","Did West Virginia give the world the catalytic converter, an essential part of every gasoline-powered automobile today? That’s what Brian Joseph, the CEO of Touchstone Research Laboratory of Triadelphia, W.Va., said in a business article in WV News on Feb. 10. The article focused on Touchstone’s technology business, which includes thermal protection systems. Some of its products have been supported by the federal government’s Small Business Innovation Research program. In touting his company, Joseph said it followed in the tradition of other inventions from West Virginia. ""The catalytic converter used in automobiles was invented in West Virginia,"" he said. Is this true? Not exactly. The catalytic converter turns harmful emissions into less harmful ones before leaving a car’s exhaust system. The catalytic converter was invented by a French chemist, Michel Frenkel, in 1909, said Elsa Atson of the Science History Institute’s Othmer Library. Frenkel had no West Virginia connection. However, the Frenkel invention was an early model, and it required refinement to produce a workable automotive part. In the early 1970s, engineers at Engelhard Industries made the biggest leap, creating what’s called the three-way catalytic converter. The Engelhard invention was considered a significant improvement over previous types of catalytic conversion. Federal regulators began requiring catalytic converters in automobiles later that decade, in order to ease air pollution, and since then, hundreds of millions have been installed. Engelhard has long been based in New Jersey, and we found no evidence that they had a West Virginia facility that was the birthplace of the new form of catalytic converter. The team of chemical engineers at Engelhard that invented the new catalytic converter was headed by Carl D. Keith and John J. Mooney. In Keith’s 2008 New York Times obituary, Lindsay Brooke, an editor at the Society of Automotive Engineers, said that the catalytic converter, ""combined with the transition to unleaded gasoline, led to a dramatic improvement in air quality and enabled the auto industry to meet the Clean Air Act regulations."" In 2002, President George W. Bush presented Keith and Mooney with the National Medal of Technology. Why does this matter? Keith was born in Stewart Creek, W.Va. So that’s a West Virginia connection. However, it’s a stretch to suggest that the catalytic converter was invented in West Virginia, as Joseph had told the newspaper. Keith earned degrees from Salem College in Winston-Salem, N.C.; Indiana University; and DePaul University in Chicago. He retired to Marco Island, Fla., and died while visiting family in New Bern, N.C. Joseph told PolitiFact West Virginia that aside from being Keith’s birthplace, West Virginia has been a hub of petrochemical innovation due to companies such as Union Carbide, which had major facilities in the state. ""The petrochemical revolution in the United States really started in West Virginia,"" Joseph said. ""Union Carbide was right at the forefront of everything. Bakelite was acquired in the 1940s."" Joseph said, ""The catalytic converter used in automobiles was invented in West Virginia."" One particularly important type of catalytic converter was co-invented by Keith, who was born in West Virginia. But he did not invent it in West Virginia. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809755F400>],/factchecks/2019/mar/27/brian-joseph/was-catalytic-converter-invented-west-virginia-not/

No, Samuel L. Jackson didn't say this about pay of teachers and rappers
","Actor Samuel L. Jackson has had a storied career, starring in movies like Pulp Fiction and Glass. Is he now taking aim at another creative industry? ""Maybe if we underpaid these modern mumble rappers and overpaid teachers there would be smarter people in the future and less s----- music,"" reads what looks like a screenshot of a tweet posted to Facebook on March 21.

Recently, he tweeted about the forthcoming Avengers and posted a Capital One commercial. But after searching Twitter, we couldn’t find the supposed tweet that was posted to Facebook. We couldn’t find any tweets mentioning music and teachers, either. One user made it look like she was retweeting Jackson by using his handle and the letters ""RT,"" meaning retweet, but she didn’t include a link to an original tweet. (She could have just as easily tweeted: ""RT @realDonaldTrump Maybe if we underpaid these modern mumble rappers and overpaid teachers there would be smarter people in the future and less s----- music."") When another account asked if he really said that, she only replied: ""Judging from all the tweets I saw, yes, lmao."" We didn’t see any tweets from the actor himself. And though it’s plausible that he could have tweeted and then deleted the statement, it’s less likely erasing such a statement would have escaped public scrutiny. We didn’t find any news coverage suggesting that Jackson ever shared this opinion, or that he tweeted and then deleted it. (By contrast, in 2018, Jackson came under fire for a legitimate tweet he made that some criticized as homophobic.) Last summer, one user on the website Quora tried to solve the quotation mystery but turned up empty when he requested any sources or links. ""This was a fake post on Twitter,"" another user said.

Viral video alleging a Muslim 'sharia zone' in West Virginia is Pants on Fire
","West Virginia went viral recently on social media. But the video post that attracted national attention was chock full of questionable claims. The two minute, 14 second video featured a man talking in what he identified as a neighborhood in West Virginia. The speaker asserted that houses nearby were being torn down in order to provide homes for several hundred Syrian Muslim refugees, and that the area was going to be turned into a ""Sharia zone"" open only to Muslims. Here’s a portion of the video’s narration: ""West Virginia’s $784 million in debt -- complete, absolute debt. Right here, they are building new houses where they have taken white folks and blacks folks and they’ve moved them down the road here to substandard housing conditions, so that 321 Syrian Muslims can move down into this neighborhood in two months when these are completed. This is going to cost us $87 million. You see that funeral home right there? It is to be torn down in two months and a mosque is going to be built there. In six months this place is going to be a Sharia Zone, meaning no non-Christians can walk down here except Muslims. … They’re living here free on your taxpayers’ money. … These Islamic people here, they get $400 for each child while regular Americans get nothing -- they get cars, they get phones, they get free healthcare. Screw these Muslims, and get them out. This is where your money is, West Virginia, $87 million."" The earliest example of the video we found was posted to Facebook and Twitter on March 4, 2017, by Jason James Britt, who describes himself as a rabbi and educator who lives in Florida. The profile picture on his Facebook page looks like the speaker in the video, and he began his remarks with ""Shalom,"" the Hebrew greeting. Britt is also referenced as the speaker in multiple YouTube postings of the video, and Britt’s Facebook page includes several photographs of him in West Virginia, including one tagged in Charleston, wearing what appears to be the same jacket used in the video. We reached out to Britt via Facebook but did not receive a reply. Initially, the Facebook post did not receive much attention. Then, a right-leaning Twitter account tweeted it on March 5, 2019. As of March 26, 2019, Britt’s original Facebook video has been viewed over more than 4.1 million times. The video includes a number of claims, but we’ll focus on just a few -- the ones involving around refugee resettlement. The video says ""321 Syrian Muslims"" were would soon be moving into the housing complex. The video was made in 2017. However, according to the Refugee Processing Center, which is operated by the federal Department of State, only 13 Syrian immigrants were resettled in West Virginia during fiscal year 2017. And that covers the entire state. Only one immigrant from the Middle East moved to Charleston, the actual location of the video, that year, and they were from Iraq. The area referred to in the video is a government housing development called Littlepage Terrace. Below is an image from Google Street View that shows the same buildings and smokestack seen in the video.  The area was indeed receiving renovations, as Britt said, but it was not being done on behalf of Syrian refugees. Years before the video was posted, the Littlepage Terrace area began undergoing renovations because the buildings were too old and not up to code -- renovations that were covered extensively in the local media. New two-story townhomes were built in its place. Funeral home demolition and mosque construction The funeral home that Britt was pointing to is still there. We confirmed this by contacting Em Carpenter, a contributor to the Ordinary Times, a local blog. Carpenter debunked the video’s claims in a post, and she told PolitiFact that the funeral home has been out of business since 2012 and did not become a mosque. The 2017 video said that in West Virginia, ""they are building new houses … so that 321 Syrian Muslims can move down into this neighborhood in two months. … (A funeral home) is to be torn down in two months and a mosque is going to built there."" While the area was indeed being renovated, it was because the old buildings were in poor repair and not for the benefit of refugees. In fact, government data shows that not a single Syrian refugee was resettled in Charleston in 2017, and even including all of West Virginia the number of Syrian refugees was a tiny fraction of the number claimed. The funeral home, meanwhile, has not become a mosque. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097280640>],/factchecks/2019/mar/27/facebook-posts/viral-video-alleging-muslim-sharia-zone-west-virgi/

No, Joseph Stalin didn't say this statement about elections
","Joseph Stalin was a dictator who ruled the Soviet Union for a quarter of a century, so it’s perhaps apropos that he should opine about rigged elections. ""It is enough that the people know there was an election,"" begins a quote attributed to Stalin on Facebook on March 21. ""The people who cast the votes decide nothing. The people who count the votes decide everything."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Plenty of other places cite Stalin as the person who said this, but we couldn’t find any credible, original sources explaining the attribution. So we reached out to the Stalin Digital Archive, an electronic database of documents and images that resulted from a collaboration between the Russian State Archive of Social and Political History and Yale University Press. A search of the archive didn’t find any matching quotes, the archive’s support staff told PolitiFact in an email. But because most of the archive’s contents are images, it’s possible that the quote eluded the query. Next, we reached out to some members of the archive’s editorial board for insight. J. Arch Getty, a history professor at UCLA, told us he doesn’t think Stalin said this. ""I am not aware of any original source for this, and in my extensive archival research in Stalin’s personal archive, I found nothing like this,"" Getty said. ""There are many apocryphal quotes wrongly attributed to Stalin, and I think this is one of them."" James Harris, a senior lecturer in modern European history at the University of Leeds, agreed the attribution seemed suspect. ""Almost certainly apocryphal,"" Harris said in an email. Ron Suny, a professor of social and political history at the University of Michigan, said he had never seen or heard the quotation before. ""Many things that are attributed to Stalin are false,"" he said. ""I would not attribute this to him."" But Mark Kramer, director of the Cold War studies program at Harvard University, pointed us to something close. In memoirs written after his retirement, Boris Bazhanov, Stalin’s former personal secretary, claimed that Stalin said: ""Я считаю, что совершенно неважно, кто и как будет в партии голосовать; но вот что чрезвычайно важно, это кто и как будет считать голоса."" It translates to: ""I regard it as completely unimportant who in the party will vote and how, but it is extremely important who will count the votes and how."" Bazhanov said Stalin was talking about the voting procedures for higher organs of the Communist Party, according to Kramer. ""There is no way to know for sure whether he is accurately recounting Stalin’s words, if Stalin in fact said such a thing,"" Kramer said. ""Hence, I regard this as a statement attributed to Stalin by his former secretary Boris Bazhanov."" David Brandenberger, an associate history professor at the University of Richmond, said Bazhanov fled the Soviet Union in 1928 and then published his ""rather unreliable muckraking memoir in 1930."" ""Most experts consider Bazhanov’s Stalin quotation to be apocryphal,"" he said. Another version of this so-called Stalin quote, as Brandenberger called it, is: ""In the bourgeois countries, it is not important how they vote, but how they do the counting."" Some say Stalin was quoting Napoleon III, Brandenberger said, but there’s no authentic record showing this.

No, Congress didn't repeal a law that bars Muslims from holding office
","Dick Cheney and Nancy Pelosi are hardly political bedfellows, but a recent Facebook post puts the politicians in cahoots in connection with an old law. ""Congress quietly repealed the McCarran Warner Act of 1952 forbidding ‘Muslims’ from holding office,"" reads the text of the post published on March 20. ""Members of that Congress were Dick Cheney, John McCain, Joe Biden, Al Gore, John Kerry, Mitch McConnell, Chuck Schumer & Nancy Pelosi…... see the agenda?"" We didn’t, but the post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, let’s look at the law. It’s called the McCarran-Walter Act, not the McCarran Warner Act, and it’s actually the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952. It’s named for Pat McCarran, then a Democratic senator from Nevada, and Francis Walter, then a Democratic representative from Pennsylvania. Both men worried about communists infiltrating the country through the immigration system, and they wanted to limit who could come to the United States. The resulting law codified an existing quota system for immigration. It also introduced a new system that gave preferences to some immigrants based on their skill sets and whether they would be reunited with their families. As the U.S. Department of State’s Office of the Historian notes, the new act revised the 1924 National Origins Quota System by admitting people of different nationalities to the United States at a rate of one-sixth of 1 percent of however many immigrants from a country were living in the United States in 1920. That meant that 85 percent of about 154,000 visas available annually went to people from northern and western European lineage. President Harry Truman worried that the law was discriminatory, but Congress had enough votes to override his veto. The law does not mention religion or Muslims. It also doesn’t bar Muslims from holding office. But over the years, according to a 1990 story in the New York Times, it was used to deny entry to the United States to people like writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Ian Smith, the former prime minister of Rhodesia. Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan sponsored legislation to repeal the section of the law that excludes aliens for ideological reasons, and in February 1990 it passed the Senate 98-0 as an amendment to a State Department spending bill, the Times reported. ""The measure covers only aliens seeking to enter the United States for short visits,"" the paper said. ""Those seeking permanent status can still be barred because of their beliefs or memberships."" But a State Department spokesman then said that the legislation wouldn’t noticeably change current policy, since a 1977 measure already required that people denied entry because of their beliefs be granted a waiver unless it could be shown that they posed a national security threat. The repeal legislation still allowed the secretary of state to deny entry to someone identified as a terrorist. Next, let’s look at who the members of Congress were in 1990. Schumer and Pelosi were in the House, and McCain, Biden, Gore, Kerry and McConnell were in the Senate. Dick Cheney, meanwhile, was secretary of defense for then-President George H.W. Bush.   Our ruling Though Congress repealed a provision of the McCarran-Walter Act, the law never forbid Muslims from holding office as the Facebook post claims.

Florida Democrat says medical pot use keeps patients off organ transplant list
","As the Florida Legislature moved to end the ban on smoking medical marijuana, a Broward Democrat said that patients awaiting transplants face discrimination if they use marijuana. Sen. Gary Farmer raised the issue for medical marijuana cardholders on the Senate floor. ""I was shocked to learn that some patients who are on transplant lists for kidney or other organs are being dropped from the list simply because they are shown as a licensed card holder under the database,"" Farmer said March 7. Farmer continued: ""It’s one thing if maybe you are talking about a lung transfer and smoking of an item would impact the viability of that organ. But patients should not be discriminated against who need a kidney or some other transplant simply because, again, they are exercising a legal medical option."" Gov. Ron DeSantis signed a bill to allow smoking medical marijuana, reversing the smoking ban the Legislature implemented in 2017 following the passage of a constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana in 2016. READ MORE: All of our fact-checks on marijuana  Farmer hopes to get language included in a separate bill to protect those awaiting organs who use medical marijuana. So how often do transplant centers keep patients off transplant lists or remove them from lists due to medical marijuana? We found that it happens, but we can’t tell you how often due to a lack of national data. We found some anecdotal accounts in news reports, and learned it has prompted at least a half dozen states to pass laws to help such patients. ""I am aware that such rejections have been issues in California, Maine and Massachusetts,"" Harvard’s Dr. Jordan Tishler, an expert in the field of medical cannabis therapeutics, told PolitiFact. Another wrinkle: A patient could be rejected for an organ based on more than one factor, and whether marijuana was a reason can depend on the organ, or amount of marijuana use. Here’s what we found. There is no national policy on whether medical marijuana users are banned from organ transplant lists, according to the United Network for Organ Sharing, the organization that manages the nation’s organ transplant system under contract with the federal government. It’s up to the approximately 250 transplant centers to determine such rules. ""The rules vary from center to center and from organ to organ,"" said Arthur Caplan, founding head of the Division of Medical Ethics at NYU School of Medicine. ""I would not say the majority of centers exclude people for marijuana use, but some do."" One recent survey provides some evidence that patients are rejected. The 2016 survey of members of the American Society of Transplantation, including transplant physicians and support staff, drew about 225 responses (or 8 percent of the membership). Because the responses were anonymous, it is unknown how many of the transplant centers were included in the results. Approximately 64 respondents said their centers rejected all candidates irrespective of the organ if they used marijuana, while 117 said the center’s policy varied depending upon the organ. The remainder were unknown or didn’t respond. To learn more, we interviewed spokespersons for five Florida transplant centers — Jackson Memorial Health in Miami, Tampa General Hospital, Mayo Clinic in Jacksonville, Cleveland Clinic Weston and University of Florida Health — as well as the University of California San Francisco. They generally told us that transplant centers take marijuana use into account, including if the person excessively uses marijuana. But the decisions to evaluate applicants based on marijuana use are made on a case-by-case basis — and their hospitals don’t have a blanket ban on marijuana. Jackson Health System’s Miami Transplant Institute, which performed the country’s second-largest number of transplants in 2018, described the evaluation process as complex. ""A multidisciplinary team evaluates a patient’s eligibility to be listed for a transplant based on medical and surgical grounds, insurance, and psychosocial criteria,"" spokeswoman Tania Leets said. ""We do not turn away patients who use medical marijuana; however, we do take this into consideration during their evaluation for transplantation."" A Tampa General Hospital spokesman told us that the lung program would be the only program to not list a patient using marijuana either legal or illegal but only if that patient is inhaling the drug. (Doctors generally may suggest that certain patients who use medical marijuana avoid smoking it and ingest it in edible or oil form.) The hospital has not removed any patients from its waitlist due to medical marijuana usage. The University of California San Francisco transplant center does not remove or deny someone on the transplant list solely on marijuana use. However, if use of marijuana or other substances impair the patient’s ability to function and reliably follow medical prescriptions for dialysis and medication use, that could jeopardize a patient being placed on the transplant list. Farmer said, ""Some patients who are on transplant lists for kidney or other organs are being dropped from the list simply because they are shown as a licensed card holder"" for medical marijuana. We found a scarcity of national information to show how often someone is kept off a transplant list as a result of marijuana use. But what we did find — including anecdotal reports from several states and some survey data — indicates that some patients have been rejected from transplant lists because of their cardholder status, as Farmer said. It's important to know that every transplant center sets its own rules.

"['Retirement', 'Texas', 'Bob Hall']","
How many retired teachers in Texas are older than 100 years old?
","During a debate in the Texas Senate about legislation that would shore up the state’s teacher pension system, Republican Sen. Bob Hall from Edgewood expressed concern about the sustainability of the system based on changing demographics in the state. ""This world has changed significantly, but our overall retirement program hasn’t changed much,"" he said, addressing the bill’s author. ""If we were doing this today, we would probably take an entirely different approach. ""We’re in a situation where we now have several hundred teachers that are over 100 years old and what I've read recently is that a baby born today, their age expectancy is 110, at least. Thanks to medical science."" It’s true that there are hundreds of retired teachers in Texas who are older than 100, but Hall’s claim about life expectancy is off base. Hall’s comment referred to retired teachers Kathi Seay, a policy adviser for Hall, said that his claim about teachers over 100 years old was about retired teachers who are members of the state’s retirement system — not current teachers in the classroom. (A report from the Texas Education Agency says that the average age of Texas teachers during the 2016-17 school year was 31.2 and the oldest teacher that year was 75 years old.) Carolyn Perez, spokeswoman for the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, said that as of February the system had 420,458 retired members. Of that group, 321 were over 100 years old. That number is consistent with the count from earlier years offered by Perez. In fiscal year 2016, there were 393 retired teachers older than 100. In 2014 there were 285 and in 2012 there were 254. Current life expectancy is about 79 Hall’s staff did not provide a source for the second part of his claim, which stated that life expectancy for babies born this year is at least 110 years old. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention calculates life expectancy estimates using information from death certificates in a given year.  The most recent report on mortality, submitted to the agency by the National Center for Health Statistics, was published in 2017, when the life expectancy at birth was 78.6 years. That marked a slight decline from 2016, ""largely because of increases in mortality from unintentional injuries, suicide, diabetes, and influenza and pneumonia, with unintentional injuries making the largest contribution,"" the report says. Has the pension system (and population) changed? The Teacher Retirement System of Texas was established in 1937 and initially offered retirement benefits just to teachers and public school administrators, according to a strategic plan published by the system. It was slowly expanded and now offers retirement and health care benefits to all employees at ""public schools, educational service centers, charter schools, community and junior colleges, universities, and medical schools."" Lawmakers have also made tweaks to how the system manages investments and eligibility requirements for benefits. Data from the Social Security Administration shows that the retirement age has gone up since 1937, when the state’s system was established. The full retirement age for people born before 1937 is 65. From there forward, the retirement age slowly increases. The retirement age for people born in 1960 or later is 67. During that time, the life expectancy increased. For men born in 1930, it was an average of 58 and for women it was 62, according to the Social Security Administration. This estimate was on the low-end, ""due mainly to high infant mortality."" Our ruling Hall said ""We now have several hundred teachers that are over 100 years old and what I've read recently is that a baby born today, their age expectancy is 110, at least."" The Teacher Retirement System of Texas said that as of February, they had 321 retired members who were older than 100, so Hall is right about that number. And he’s right that life expectancy has increased since the system was established, but his characterization is exaggerated. The most recent study on mortality in the United States reports that the life expectancy for babies born in 2017 is 78.6 years, not 110. We rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1FA880>],/factchecks/2019/mar/26/bob-hall/how-many-retired-teachers-texas-are-over-100-years/
"['National', 'Medicare', 'Joe Biden']","
It's wrong to claim Trump budget cuts $845 billion from Medicare
","As Joe Biden edges toward officially running for president, he has been taking on President Donald Trump over his plans for U.S. health care programs. ""Did you see the budget that was just introduced?"" Biden said in a March 12 speech to International Association of Fire Fighters. ""It cuts $845 billion, almost a trillion dollar cut in Medicare. And almost a quarter trillion, $240 billion, in Medicaid. Why? Because of a tax cut for the super wealthy that created a deficit of $1.9 trillion, and now they got to go make somebody pay for it."" Other Democratic presidential candidates and other leaders, including Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, have used the $845 billion figure. But there are a couple of problems with it. The correct amount is closer to $595 billion — or less, depending on the method used. And the use of the word ""cuts"" is debatable, because spending rises steadily from year to year in Trump’s proposed 2019-20 budget. The reduction is from the path Medicare would be on, if nothing changed. Slowing the growth of Medicare is an approach President Barack Obama advanced in his last two budgets. (As Obama’s vice president, those were Biden’s budgets, too.) The administration would spend $9.398 trillion on Medicare between 2020 and 2029. But the White House predicts that the government would have spent $10.244 trillion in the same time frame. The difference is $846 billion. But dig deeper, and the numbers change. First, Trump’s plan takes two hefty pieces of Medicare — extra payments to hospitals that serve a lot of uninsured patients and funds for teaching hospitals — and moves them out of Medicare and into the regular general fund budget. Hospitals still get paid, but the money doesn’t come from the main Medicare trust fund. Spending does fall a bit, but not nearly by as much as the Medicare line items suggest. Factoring in those dollars — about $250 billion — reduces the total ten-year spending reduction to $595 billion for Medicare. Some analysts push the number even lower. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a think tank that aims to reduce deficits, noted that the administration’s spending plan includes hoped-for savings from changes in medical liability laws, drug regulations and other elements that lie outside of Medicare. Those wouldn’t curtail Medicare services but could result in Medicare cost savings. All told, the committee said the spending reductions could be as low as $515 billion over 10 years. Most of the proposed changes target payments to hospitals and other providers — and that might not affect the 58 million elderly and disabled people on Medicare. While hospital trade groups push back, many analysts believe there is room to spend less without hurting recipients. ""In general, these proposals are in areas where there is evidence we pay providers too much,"" Matthew Fiedler, at the Brookings Institution Center for Health Policy, told us recently. ""One big proposal is to make payments site-neutral. Currently, we often pay more for the same service when it’s delivered in a hospital rather than in a doctor’s office, even when there’s no evidence the site of service makes a difference."" Two of the plans along these lines would save a combined $160 billion, according to the Health and Human Services Department. It’s important to note, though, that not all of the proposed cuts land on providers. Changes in Medicare’s Part D prescription drug insurance program would directly affect recipients. While one proposal would cap out-of-pocket costs for people with the very highest drug costs, another would expose people below that cost level to higher fees. At the end of the day, the Trump budget reduces payments for people who rely on prescription drugs by $50 billion. The prescription drug changes might be the clearest example of Medicare cuts in the Trump budget that affect ordinary Americans. The remaining $545 billion potentially could be absorbed by providers. While Democrats criticize Trump for cutting Medicare, Obama regularly offered his own version of steps to rein in the growth of Medicare. In his last budget, Obama proposed trimming spending by about $420 billion over 10 years.  In effect, Biden is chastising Trump for something close to the budget he was part of. (Republicans accused Obama and Democrats of cutting Medicare many times, a claim we never rated better than Half True.) The reality is, program spending rises every year in Trump’s budget, except for the last one in 2029 (which is mainly a fluke of timing related to when Medicare pays its bills). So, what’s the difference between a cut and a reduction? ""This issue has been around for decades,"" said Tricia Neuman, the Kaiser Family Foundation’s Medicare policy director. ""It is a proposed reduction relative to the baseline. A cut sounds worse than a reduction, but the effect is the same. If these proposals were adopted, there would be less money paid to providers for specific Medicare services than there would have been."" Biden said Trump’s budget cuts $845 billion, ""almost a trillion dollar cut,"" in Medicare. There are several problems with this. A more accurate figure lies between $515 billion and $595 billion. Just about all of the reductions target providers and there’s broad agreement that hospitals and other providers could be more efficient. These are reductions against a baseline, but spending rises steadily year to year. Biden pushed the numbers even further by calling it an ""almost a trillion dollar cut."" We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE0080>],/factchecks/2019/mar/26/joe-biden/trump-medicare-budget-cuts-billion/

Entering ATM PIN backwards won't call the police
","A viral Facebook post advises ATM users being forced to withdraw cash to enter their PIN backwards to secretly call the police. No ATMs in United States have, or have ever had, this security feature. Snopes, which also rated the Facebook post false, reported that the image began circulating online in 2006. The image includes a photo of what appears to be an ATM robbery and the following text: ""If a thief forces you to take money out of an ATM, do not argue or resist. What you do is punch in your pin # backwards. EX: if its 1234, you’ll type 4321. When you do that, the money will come out but will be stuck in the slot. The machine will immediately alert the local police without the robbers knowledge & begin taking photos of the suspect. Every ATM has the feature. Stay safe."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Though this claim is wrong, it doesn’t come out of nowhere. In 1998, Chicago businessman Joseph Zingher patented a system that recognizes PIN variations as distress signals and calls the police. Zingher pitched his system, called SafetyPIN, to banks and lawmakers in several states. ATMs with SafetyPIN would enable users to enter their PIN backwards to call the police as the Facebook post describes. Someone with a palindromic PIN — such as 2332 — would enter a different PIN variation to call the police. Lawmakers in several states — including Illinois, Kansas, and Georgia — have introduced bills that would mandate emergency-PIN technology, but no such laws have gone into effect. In Illinois, an ATM security law passed, but it only made installing the technology optional. The Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 called on the Federal Trade Commission to create a report to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of installing emergency-PIN technology. The resulting 2010 report by the FTC determined that the technology never has been implemented. It continues to conclude that ""emergency-PIN technologies likely would not have a large impact on ATM crime."" The report said that while the technological concept behind the ""reverse-PIN"" system has been discussed, the idea that ATM customers can utilize it falls into ""the realm of urban legend."" The FTC report also described several problems with systems like SafetyPIN. For instance, people may struggle to recall their PIN variation and enter it without drawing suspicion. Also, installing emergency-PIN technology could cost millions of dollars, while ATM robberies are a rare crime. According to surveys conducted by the Bank Administration Institute and the American Bankers Association, there is one ATM crime for every 3.5 million transactions. This statistic includes other types of crime besides robbery. David Tente, executive director of the ATM Industry Association, wrote in a March 21 email to PolitiFact that the idea that reverse-PIN technology is in use is ""a myth."" ""We oppose all such measures as being ineffective and potentially dangerous for the consumer,"" Tente wrote. ""We do not believe it will deter any criminals. And consumers who would attempt to use such measures could be at risk for being harmed by a nervous criminal."" ATM robberies and myths about emergency-PIN technologies are not unique to the United States. The Australian Bankers’ Association released a fact sheet that said ""information circulating in an e-mail about the use of a ‘reverse PIN’ at an ATM is false."" The fact sheet includes several tips about how to stay safe when using an ATM, including scanning the surroundings before approaching an ATM, immediately putting away the money instead of counting it in public, and withdrawing cash at grocery stores or gas stations. According to the FTC report and industry experts, there are no ATMs with emergency-PIN technology. ATM users being forced to withdraw cash cannot enter their PIN backwards to call the police. Further, this type of security system may not deter crime at ATMs. For ATM users in distress, entering their PIN backwards will not call the police and could escalate a dangerous situation.

Missouri legislator highlights lack of African-American representation in budget discussion
","In the middle of Black History Month, the Missouri Legislative Black Caucus held a press conference where Rep. Tommie Pierson Jr. claimed no African-Americans have presented the state budget to the House Budget Committee this year. ""As I have been sitting in the budgetary process here in the Missouri House, we have been reviewing facts and figures and numbers as we have been looking at the $28 billion Missouri budget,"" Pierson said. ""And those folks who have been coming before us – statewide elected officials, directors, deputy directors, analysts, and on and on – I have been trying to keep a tally of a number. And the number is how many African Americans have presented this $28 billion Missouri budget, and that number is zero."" Pierson said, when talking about diversity and inclusivity, who is in state leadership should be taken into consideration. He is concerned by the lack of African-American representation in decisions on how to allocate $28 billion of state money. We wanted to know if Pierson is correct. First, a little backstory on how the state budget process works: Heads of state departments make presentations to the budget committee in the House and the appropriations committee in the Senate. In these presentations, leaders of departments in the executive branch discuss the financial needs of their departments with the legislators in charge of appropriating funds to the departments. The executive branch is made up of 16 executive departments and six statewide elected officials. State Rep. Cody Smith, R-Carthage, is the chair for the House Budget Committee. His chief of staff Chris Dunn explained that directors of state departments or elected officials and their director of finance usually present the budget for their department. He emphasized that the budget committee does not choose who presents the budget, the departments presenting make that decision internally. According to the minutes from the Missouri House of Representatives, every state department direction but one presented their department budget to the House Budget Committee. Chlora Lindley-Myers is the director of the Department of Insurance, Financial Institutions and Professional Registration and an African-American, but she did not present the budget for her department. Lori Cory, a spokeswoman for the department, said in an email, ""Director Lindley-Myers was unable to be present at the Jan. 31 presentation to the House Budget Committee due to a previous commitment. She was attending a National Association of Insurance Commissioners Meeting."" The deputy director and department budget officer presented in her absence, but Lindley-Meyers did present to the Senate Appropriations Committee, Croy said. The lack of African-Americans presenting the state budget reflects a larger concern: the lack of African-Americans in high ranking positions in statewide offices. Of the 22 offices in the executive branch, only two are headed by non-white people. We spoke to Steele Shippy, the communications director for Gov. Mike Parson. Shippy defended the racial diversity in the governor’s cabinet, pointing to Lindley-Myers and Anna Hui, director of the state Department of Labor. The Department of Labor’s website says Hui is the first Asian-American to serve in the governor’s cabinet. She was appointed in March 2017 and confirmed in January 2018. The directors of the executive departments are appointed by the governor. Department directors do not always leave their position with the turnover of the governor, so many of the current department directors were appointed by former Govs. Jay Nixon and Eric Greitens. Parson’s office declined to answer questions in regards to the office’s awareness of the lack of diversity or efforts to promote diversity. Pierson said no African-Americans presented the state budget to the House Budget Committee. According to records from the House of Representatives and other sources, he is correct. The only African-American state department director, Chlora Lindley-Myers, did not present to the House Budget Committee due to a prior commitment in her schedule.

Fact-checking Mark Walker's video on HR 1’s campaign-finance provisions
","If you’re a voter in the United States, you’ve probably seen your fair share of political ads on TV. And if you’re Rep. Mark Walker, R-N.C., you’ve apparently seen enough of them. A sarcastic new ad video Walker put out this month pokes fun at political campaign ads — and House Democrats’ plan to help finance them. The video shows an actor who, playing the role of a politician, is seen woodworking by a river. ""Hey there,"" the actor says. ""I’m a politician, attempting to do human things so that I look relatable."" The ad targets HR 1, the sweeping election-law bill House Democrats passed March 8. Walker, who represents North Carolina’s 6th Congressional District, posted it to YouTube March 7 and shared it the following day via Twitter and a press release. ""This week, House Democrats will pass HR 1,"" the actor in the ad says. ""They’re calling it the ‘For the People Act,’ but really, it’s for my campaign consultants."" ""HR 1 is going to take your hard-earned tax dollars and millions more and send them to my campaign so I can put ads on TV,"" he continues.  PolitiFact North Carolina found the ad funny, but also interesting. We decided to check its claims against the text of the bill, which is meant to overhaul the laws surrounding money in politics but is expected to die in the Senate. Our finding: Despite what Walker’s ad says, the public-financing program put in place by HR 1 would not depend on tax dollars, and not all candidates would qualify to benefit from it. One goal of HR 1 is to minimize the influence big donors and super PACs wield over elections. HR 1 would provide a 6-to-1 match for small-dollar donations and create a pilot program in three states to provide $25 vouchers for eligible voters to give money to candidates for Congress. Walker’s ad gives the impression that anybody running for federal office would stand to benefit from these provisions, but that’s not actually the case. For starters, the 6-to-1 ratio would only apply to donations of $200 or less, including those made via the voucher program. Not all candidates would be allowed to receive matched donations, either. To be eligible, they would have to raise $50,000 in small-dollar donations from at least 1,000 individuals during the qualifying period, and they would have to agree to accept no contributions larger than $1,000. Ray La Raja, professor of political science and an expert in campaign finance at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, said the eligibility requirements would make the matching program attractive to some candidates more than others. ""My hunch is that many Democrats would participate under the reform, but probably not those who expect highly competitive elections,"" he said. ""They would not want to risk coming up short of money for the campaign."" ""Additionally, candidates who have ideological followings will likely benefit from this program,"" he added. ""Ideological candidates tend to draw more small donors."" Walker’s ad suggests that these programs — and the ads they could help finance — would be paid for using taxpayer money. As the bill is currently formatted, that’s not the case. The money would actually come from a new ""Freedom From Influence Fund"" under the U.S. Treasury, which would collect funds from a 2.75 percent fee assessed on criminal and civil fines and penalties or settlements with banks and corporations that commit corporate malfeasance. Michael Malbin, executive director of the Campaign Finance Institute, a nonprofit think tank for campaign-finance research, said money coming from the fees would not be taxpayer money. ""Anything that’s funded by penalties is not being funded by taxpayers,"" he said. Rick Hasen, professor of law and politics at the University of California, Irvine, took a less certain position. ""I think it is debatable whether it is still fair to call it ‘tax dollars’ being used to pay for the ads,"" he said, adding that the funds will enter into the ""public fisc"" with taxpayer money even though they are ""not from a direct tax."" In any case, Walker spokesman Jack Minor said the fees were not part of the version of HR 1 that was introduced to the House Jan. 3 or the version reported from the Committee on House Administration on March 4. ""Congressman Walker is a member of the House Administration Committee,"" Minor said. ""The bill that passed through there … there was no discernable funding structure."" The fees were added by an amendment during a Rules Committee debate on March 5, after the Congressional Budget Office had estimated the bill’s costs. Earlier versions of the bill did not make it clear where the Freedom From Influence Fund was supposed to get most of its money. But the funding mechanism was in place before Walker circulated his ad online. Minor said problems could arise when moving the fee money to the Freedom From Influence Fund. ""This money would go to the Treasury’s General Fund where it would be intermingled with all taxpayer money as public funds,"" he said. ""Later, an equal amount would be transferred from the Treasury’s General Fund to the Freedom From Influence Fund."" Noting that the CBO estimated very high costs for the bill’s provisions, Minor also said the money from fees would not be enough to pay for the donation-matching and vouchers. ""The federal government taking money from an American citizen is a tax,"" he said. ""And when Congress irresponsibly creates new pools of money that will inevitably fall short of adequate funding levels, Congress must take money from taxpayers to pay for the shortfall."" But the bill explicitly states that no money would be drawn from outside the Freedom From Influence Fund, and that the payments used for vouchers and grants would be reduced if there was not enough money in the fund. ""In any case in which the Commission determines that there are insufficient moneys in the Fund to make payments to participating candidates under this title, moneys shall not be made available from any other source for the purpose of making such payments,"" the bill says. If HR 1 were to become law, future legislation could still change the funding mechanism to one based on tax dollars. A similar program for judicial candidates in North Carolina — which was repealed in 2013 — got half of its money from a $3 voluntary check-off on the state tax form, according to a summary of the program from Democracy North Carolina, an advocacy group focused on voter participation and money in politics. So it would not be unusual to see taxes come into play. But the version of HR 1 that passed takes specific steps to avoid dipping into taxpayer money. Walker’s ad said, ""HR 1 is going to take your hard-earned tax dollars and millions more and send them to (a candidate’s) campaign so (he) can put ads on TV."" The video glosses over some key details about HR 1 to leave a misleading impression. First, the bill’s public-financing options would not be available to all candidates, generally speaking. To be eligible, candidates would have to satisfy certain threshold requirements and refuse to accept individual contributions of more than $1,000. Second, as the bill is currently structured, the program would get money from a 2.75 percent fee on people and corporations that commit malfeasance — not from a broad pool of tax dollars. The ad contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. So we rate it Mostly False.

"['Education', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe claim of record K-12 spending is misleading
","Democrat Terry McAuliffe, expected to say this week whether he’ll run for president in 2020, loves to boast about his governorship from 2014 to 2018. ""When I left office, I want to say that I left the state in very good shape,"" he said during a Jan. 24 speech at a symposium hosted by the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Among his feats, he said his administration oversaw ""the largest investment ever in K-12 education."" Let’s look at whether he really was a record breaker when it came to funding Virginia public schools. McAuliffe began making the claim midway through his governorship. As proof, his gubernatorial office once sent us a chart detailing total state aid for schools and per-pupil funding from 2001 through 2018. Raw dollars McAuliffe’s claim is based on raw dollars – money that has not been adjusted for inflation. When he took office, the record for state aid to education was $6.4 billion, set nearly six years earlier during the 2008-09 school year in the last budget before the Great Recession. Virginia finally broke that record in 2016, when McAuliffe signed a budget with $6.5 billion for the school year that began late that summer. In 2017, McAuliffe inked his final budget, authorizing $6.8 billion for K-12 – a high mark, again. In raw dollars, the McAuliffe also signed budgets that broke the state record of funding $5,248 per student – also set during the 2008-09 school year. His final budget, in 2017-18, allocated $5,444 per pupil. What about inflation? There’s a problem with comparing historic spending levels in terms of the raw money that was appropriated each year: A dollar spent today or in the future doesn’t buy as much as a buck spent in the past. So we took a more meaningful look at whether McAuliffe's plan, when adjusted for inflation, would remain the richest school budget in Virginia history. McAuliffe, as we’ve noted before, fails this test. We adjusted each of the education budgets this century to 2018 dollars, using inflation data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Under these measurements, the high-water mark came in the 2008-09 school year, when the state spent an adjusted $7.5 billion on public education. That figure exceeds the peak $6.8 billion expenditure - in raw dollars - in McAuliffe’s 2017-18 budget. In adjusted dollars, McAuliffe’s peak education budget in 2017-18 falls below the three state budgets that were in effect from July 2006 through June 2009. We applied the same inflation adjustments to per-pupil spending, which is the gold standard in evaluating education budgets because it takes into account Virginia’s rising enrollments. The glory days for state spending per student once again occurred during the budgets from July 2006 to June 2009. Virginia, in adjusted 2018 dollars, spent $5,675 to $5,966 per pupil during those school years. McAuliffe’s peak proposal of $5,444 per student during the 2017-18 school year didn’t rise to that level. A side note: Virginia still hasn’t recovered all the ground lost to the Great Recession and won’t anytime very soon. The General Assembly recently approved education budgets for each of the next two school years that don’t match inflation-adjusted spending during the last school year before the recession.    Our ruling McAuliffe says that during his governorship from 2014 t0 2018, Virginia made ""the largest investment ever in K-12 education."" In raw dollars, the McAuliffe did sign budgets during his last two years that set state records for overall education spending and per-student outlays. But this is misleading, A meaningful comparison of historic spending levels requires that the figures be adjusted for inflation. When that’s done, McAuliffe’s education budgets never rose to the levels of the three years before the Great Recession. So we rate the McAuliffe’s claim Mostly False.    ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1AA4C0>],/factchecks/2019/mar/26/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-claim-record-k-12-spending-misleading/

Hillary Clinton says background check of Charleston church shooter wasn't 'fast enough'
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton defended her call for stricter gun control in the wake of the mass shooting in San Bernardino, Calif. Clinton’s Republican rivals have criticized her for pushing gun control following a terrorist attack. But lax firearms laws, Clinton said on ABC’s This Week, allow people on the no-fly list to purchase guns, just as they enabled Dylann Roof, accused of killing nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church attack in June. ""(Roof) should have never have been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough,"" Clinton said Dec. 6. ""We should be able to approach both of these with some sense of, you know, unity about how we prevent terrorist attacks and how we prevent the wrong people from getting ahold of guns."" Is Clinton right that this system didn’t catch the Charleston shooter in time? She omits some important details in her description, but it largely checks out. How Roof obtained a gun Under current federal law, the FBI performs background checks on would-be gun buyers in South Carolina and 29 other states through its National Instant Criminal Background Check System (the rest of the states do their own background checks). If the check isn’t denied or completed in three days, the gun seller can proceed with the sale. What happened in Roof’s case comes down to clerical errors. Here’s how FBI Director James Comey explained why Roof’s background check wasn’t finished in time to prevent his purchase of a .45-caliber Glock pistol. Roof tried to buy a handgun in West Columbia, S.C., a suburb of Columbia, on April 11. A West Virginia-based FBI examiner began vetting him the next business day, April 13, and found that Roof had been arrested for a felony drug charge March 1 (the charge was later corrected as a misdemeanor). Because the records didn’t show a conviction, the examiner couldn’t deny the purchase but continued to look into Roof’s criminal history. Roof’s rap sheet mistakenly listed the neighboring county’s sheriff office as the agency that arrested him, leading the FBI examiner to request more information on Roof from the wrong county sheriff’s and prosecutor’s offices. The examiner then contacted the West Columbia police, who replied they had no records of Roof’s arrest. Had the database listed the correct police station (Columbia) or included the report in which Roof admitted to possessing drugs, things would have turned out different, according to Comey. ""If a NICS examiner saw that, Roof would be denied permission to buy a gun. But the examiner never saw that,"" he said. When the three days were up on April 16, the case was still listed as ""pending"" and Roof was able to purchase the gun. Two months later, on June 17, Roof allegedly shot and killed nine worshippers and injured one in a historically black church in Charleston. Clerical error or ‘Charleston loophole’ Both sides of the gun debate came to very different conclusions about this news. Clinton and some advocates for tighter gun laws argued Roof was abetted by the three-day time limit for background checks, dubbing it the ""Charleston loophole."" Supporters of gun rights say the onus is actually on the FBI and its botched paperwork. Daniel Webster, the director of the Center for Gun Policy and Research at Johns Hopkins University, agrees with Clinton that the FBI would have been able to catch Roof’s conviction if it had more than three days to track down the details. ""The follow-up investigation found that the FBI analyst doing the check was still in the process of tracking down the information on the case and hadn’t given up because of the clerical error,"" Webster said. CNN reported that FBI examiners officially denied Roof’s gun purchase application a week after the shooting, when he was already in custody. Usually when the FBI denies a gun purchase after the fact, the agency notifies the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which then retrieves the firearm. In 2014, the FBI denied approximately 1.1 percent, or 91,000, of would-be gun purchases within three days. Of the transactions that required more than three days to vet, the FBI referred 2,511 for retrieval. Back in 2000, the Government Accountability Office reported it took an average of 25 business days for the FBI to determine whether a gun purchase should have been denied. We could not find more recent data. Our ruling Clinton said the Charleston shooter ""should have never have been given a gun, but the universal background check was not fast enough."" Dylann Roof admitted to a drug offense a few weeks before he tried to buy a gun, so the FBI said he should have been denied one. However, it wasn’t the three-day time limit by itself that undermined Roof’s background check. There were clerical errors in the FBI’s database that prevented the examiner from seeing Roof’s drug admission. Clinton’s characterization misses some important information about Roof’s case. We rate it Mostly True. Note to readers: A previous version of this fact-check incorrectly said Roof ""admitted to a felony drug offense"" before attempting to buy a gun. That is not what the FBI news release said. The release said that a police report about his arrest included Roof's admission to possessing illegal drugs, which Comey said would have been enough to deny the sale of the handgun. The story has been updated to reflect that point.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097045900>],/factchecks/2015/dec/06/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-background-check-charleston-c/

Marco Rubio: 700,000 Americans could be affected by bill tying terrorist watch list to gun purchases
","Democrats’ proposed legislation to stop terrorists from buying guns would unintentionally harm the Second Amendment rights of everyday Americans, said presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. Rubio and other Senate Republicans voted down legislation that allowed the attorney general to ban ""known or suspected dangerous terrorists"" from obtaining firearms or explosives. Under current law, thousands of people on the FBI’s terrorist watch list have been able to purchase such weapons legally. But the terrorist watch list sometimes includes people who aren’t actually terrorists, Rubio said on CNN’s State of the Union Dec. 6, and it would be wrong to deny those people their right to own a gun. ""If these were perfect lists, that would be one thing,"" he said. ""But there are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured under this amendment the Democrats offered. And that's the problem."" We wondered if there were really 700,000 Americans who could potentially get caught up on a terrorist watch list and be prevented from buying guns under Democratic legislation. Rubio’s count is way off. The number of Americans on the consolidated terrorist watch list is likely in the thousands, not hundreds of thousands. We reached out to Rubio’s team, but they didn’t get back to us. By the numbers The FBI’s Terrorist Screening Center maintains what is colloquially known as the terrorist watch list. The Terrorist Screening Database is a consolidated collection of information about people known or reasonably suspected to have some level of involvement in terrorist activities. The no-fly list is a subset of the terrorist watch list. The terrorist watch list is the one the attorney general would pull from when deciding whether someone should be denied a firearm if there’s reasonable belief that the person would use that firearm for terrorism, under the Democrats’ bill, said Ashley Schapitl, spokeswoman for bill sponsor Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif. The terrorist watch list pulls information from numerous government agencies in the United States and around the world, so American citizens and legal residents only make up a portion of the list. A pretty small portion, in fact. A Terrorist Screening Center spokesman declined to comment on the watch list’s current size, but we found an estimate on a 2011 FBI fact-sheet that put it at 420,000 individuals. Of those, only about 8,400 were American citizens or legal residents. The no-fly list subset included about 16,000 names, only 500 of whom were Americans. Current estimates of the number of people on the list -- foreign and American combined -- now hover around 700,000, the number Rubio cited. But there’s no way that the number of Americans on the list has grown to 700,000, said Timothy Edgar, who oversaw civil liberties and national intelligence issues, including the terrorist watch list, under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ""Rubio is almost certainly off by orders of magnitude,"" said Edgar, now a visiting fellow at Brown University. The number of Americans on the list likely doesn’t exceed 10,000, said Martin Reardon, former chief of the FBI Terrorist Screening Center’s operations branch. Some innocent people have been wrongly included in the terrorist watch list or the no-fly list, which can affect their lives in ways such as having to go through extra airport security or being stopped from boarding a plane. But for an American to get on that list by accident is ""harder than people think,"" added Reardon, who is now a vice president at the Soufan Group, a consulting firm. It’s more likely that a person would have the same name as someone who is on the list, and that person could run into problems at the airport if a security agent makes a misidentification, Reardon said. This happened to the late Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who once wasn’t allowed to fly because he had a similar name to the alias of a suspected terrorist on the no-fly list. But the problem of same names is less common than it used to be, and there is a reasonably efficient redress process for people to appeal to the government to get their name removed from the terrorist watch list, Edgar noted. ""That shows that the redress process is not a sham, but it also shows that a fairly significant number of people are put on the watchlist by mistake,"" he said. Still, it’s nowhere close to 700,000 Americans. Our ruling Rubio said, ""There are over 700,000 Americans on some watch list or another that would all be captured"" in a Democratic amendment intended to stop suspected terrorists from buying guns. Under the Democrats’ proposal, the attorney general would have some discretion in denying firearms to people on the FBI’s consolidated terrorist watchlist. While it’s reasonable to estimate that there are 700,000 people on this list, only a small fraction are American citizens or legal residents. Experts said it’s likely that only about 10,000 are Americans, while the rest are foreigners.

","The November column by the PETA Foundation’s Heather Moore was just in time to save you from holiday traditions like roasted ham or cooking your turkey with a little bacon for that extra flavor. Citing the World Health Organization’s latest pronouncements on the links between cancer and red meat, Moore’s op-ed piece encouraged ""the meat-eating public"" to give up all animal-based foods and embrace the vegan lifestyle. She was nearly finished with her attack on eating pigs and cows when she made this point: ""each vegan spares more than 100 animals every year."" So a non-vegan eats at least 100 animals a year? We searched through the PolitiFact archives and found PolitiFact Georgia had fact checked a similar claim in 2011 after the People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals had made Bill Clinton its ""Man of the Year."" On that occasion, PETA claimed a plant-based diet ""spared the lives of nearly 200 animals per year."" PolitiFact Georgia rated that claim Half True and now PETA, in its Nov. 17 column in The Providence Journal, referred to the same statistic by saying ""more than 100."" PETA’s data hasn’t changed — only the way the data is characterized. After all, ""nearly 200"" is indeed ""more than 100.""  Moore, in an email, pointed us to virtually the same data and analysis that PolitiFact Georgia reviewed in 2011. But now, that information, which is available on the Internet, includes a note about the 2011 PolitiFact ruling that faulted PETA for not saying that small sea creatures such as shellfish made up an overwhelming majority of the nearly 200 ""animals."" The calculation cited by PETA and Moore starts with the total number of animals raised in the United States or imported for American consumption, based on statistics from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration and other sources, Then all the cows, pigs, fish, and fowl, shellfish, lobsters and other crustaceans are divided by the people in the country who eat them. The product of that calculation is the animal death toll for which PETA blames the average American meat eater. Chris Hurt, a professor of agricultural economics at Purdue University, told PolitiFact Georgia that, although misleading, he found the statement technically accurate. Our ruling Perhaps the most misleading thing about Moore’s column is that from the opening sentences onward she writes about pigs and cows and the health risks of meat eating. She doesn’t touch on fish or fowl (or crustaceans) in her argument. She concludes: ""Researchers have found that people who eat plant-based meals are between 25 and 50 percent less likely to get cancer, and each vegan spares more than 100 animals every year. ""Bacon isn't worth dying for — not for people and certainly not for pigs. With so many tasty vegan foods to enjoy, kicking the meat habit is entirely possible. And it could save your life."" There is no way a reader would know that the 100 animals she refers to are mostly animals that live underwater as opposed to the barnyard animals that she and the World Health Organization warned us not to eat.   This is the point PolitiFact Georgia made four years ago as noted by her source. And although Moore referred to ""more than 100"" rather than saying ""nearly 200,"" she still fails to provide the context that’s necessary to understand how the number is calculated. For that reason, the Half True in 2011 becomes a Mostly False in 2015.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3A8F40>],/factchecks/2015/dec/06/heather-moore/vegan-leaves-real-meat-claim-untouched/

Ted Cruz incorrectly says government trying to force boys and girls to shower together
","Sen. Ted Cruz recently veered from discussing Syria to suggesting our government wants schoolboys to shower with girls. The Republican presidential candidate commented after interviewer Steven Crowder mentioned ""genetically proper pronouns."" ""Look,"" Cruz said, ""these guys are so nutty that the federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls."" The Texan went on: ""Now listen: I’m the father of two daughters, and the idea that the federal government is coming in saying that boys, with all the god-given equipment of boys, can be in the shower room with junior high girls – this is lunacy. And I bet you there are a whole lot of parents – particularly parents of daughters – that are not eager to have the federal government saying, ‘Guess what? Your daughter has to shower with a boy, if he wants to be in there,’ "" Cruz said.  A video of the conversation was posted online Nov. 19, 2015. We hadn’t heard about a push for coed showers by the government under President Barack Obama and also didn’t hear back from Cruz’s campaign about how he concluded the government is trying to let boys shower with girls. But a Nov. 22, 2015, news story in The Advocate said Cruz ""appeared to be alluding to the administration’s recent support of two separate transgender students who have sued their school districts after administrators refused to let the students use the restrooms and locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity."" Our read: Just one of the mentioned situations involves a student seeking access to locker rooms, though news stories indicate there have been other recent instances of transgender individuals seeking unfettered access to high school locker rooms. What’s a transgender person? For starters, it’s not factually accurate to say that letting transgender students into locker rooms amounts to boys being permitted to shower with girls. A transgender individual is a person whose gender identity, expression or behavior is different from those typically associated with their assigned sex at birth, according to the National Center for Transgender Equality. Broadly, this can mean a person born a boy identifies as a girl or vice versa. A transgender also may receive hormone treatments and undertake sex reassignment surgery. Pat Griffin, a professor emeritus at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, advocates for including lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender students in college and interscholastic athletics. Griffin wrote in September 2015: ""It is important for policy-makers to understand that transgender girls (who were assigned a male gender at birth) are not boys. Their consistent and affirmed gender identity as girls is as deep-seated as the gender identity of non-transgender girls."" After we posted this fact check, readers suggested we'd failed to capture the ongoing debate over transgender rights; we followed up by writing this story. ""Student A"" in Illinois The Advocate story led us to check into the case of an Illinois transgender girl barred by her school district from changing clothes for gym class and other activities with girls. The girl, represented by the ACLU of Illinois, filed a complaint in 2013 charging sex discrimination in violation of federal law. On Nov. 2, 2015, the Office of Civil Rights in the U.S. Department of Education wrote the superintendent of the school district in Palatine, Ill., northwest of Chicago, saying the district’s restriction violates Title IX, the federal bar on sex discrimination in any education program or activity. The ACLU of Illinois declared the federal holding had national significance. ""The decision places school districts all across the nation on notice that Title IX requires making such facilities available for students who are transgender,"" the group said. ""It is the first such decision issued by the department, building on legal briefs and policy statements of the federal government interpreting federal laws prohibiting discrimination."" The office’s letter, signed by regional director Adele Rapport of Chicago, says ""Student A"" was born male and from a young age identified as female, transitioning in middle school ""to living full-time as a young woman"" and, among steps evidently not including sex reassignment surgery, taking ""an ongoing course of hormone therapy."" Also, the letter says, the district has given the student ""unlimited access to all girls’ restrooms in the school"" and ""allows her to participate in girls’ athletics."" According to the letter, the student, required to take a daily gym class, sought ""an opportunity to change clothes privately within the girls’ locker rooms, in an area such as a restroom stall."" The district answered that it would not be ""practicable"" to do so in the school’s six girls locker rooms ""because there were too few stalls and too many students,"" the office wrote. The letter further says the student told the office in October 2015 she’d use privacy curtains in the locker rooms if the school made them available. Talks involving the district and office did not lead to a resolution, the letter says. School district stresses private changing rooms The Palatine-based Township High School District 211 said in a Nov. 2, 2015, press release it disagreed with the department’s ruling and beyond continuing settlement negotiations, it was prepared to ""engage in all avenues of due process to determine whether our position of  honoring the rights of all the students is within the law."" The district’s release also said: ""The students in our schools are teenagers, not adults, and one's gender is not the same as one's anatomy. Boys and girls are in separate locker rooms – where there are open changing areas and open shower facilities – for a reason.""        A Nov. 3, 2015, Chicago Tribune news story said the district had 30 days to reach an agreement with authorities or risk having its federal educational funding suspended or terminated and the matter also could be referred to the Department of Justice. And on Dec. 3, 2015, after Cruz made his claim, the government announced a settlement with the district agreeing to give the student access to school locker rooms ""based on the student's request to change in private changing stations"" in the rooms. Other conflicts A Nov. 2, 2015, New York Times news story on the Illinois dispute said: ""The rights of transgender students have become the focus of disputes in school districts in many states, leading to divergent approaches regarding which sports teams they can play on, bathrooms they can use and pronouns they are addressed by. In separate cases, two California school districts agreed to lift restrictions on transgender locker room and restroom access after federal officials intervened. Students at one Missouri high school protested a decision by the district to let a transgender girl use female locker rooms and restrooms."" In the Missouri instance, the Times reported Sept. 2, 2015, transgender Lila Perry, 17, used girls’ restrooms and locker rooms until a local protest led her to drop her physical education class. Professor’s take We called Griffin, the professor emeritus, who told us it’s her view that boys showering with girls is an inaccurate characterization of the government saying transgender students should, by law, have full access to school facilities including locker rooms. Griffin also called the education department’s ruling in Illinois ""the developing precedent"" nationally. Cruz’s statement, Griffin said, amounts to ""fearmongering"" and ""reflects a complete ignorance"" of transgender students, especially overlooking the fact that a transgender girl is not a boy so ""it’s not a boy in the girls’ locker room."" In contrast, Griffin said, the focus of most U.S. school officials has been on ensuring every student has a right to privacy in a locker room or restroom. Griffin, asked about state policies on transgender student-athletes, pointed us to a breakdown on Transathlete.com, which compiles policies and research regarding transgender inclusion in sports.  According to the website, Texas ranks among about a dozen states with no policy ensuring transgender participation. The site touts Massachusetts’ policy, which says, in part: ""Where there are sex-segregated classes or athletic activities, including intramural and interscholastic athletics, all students must be allowed to participate in a manner consistent with their gender identity."" We also reached out to the federal education department, which did not comment on Cruz’s claim but pointed us to a Nov. 2, 2015, statement by Catherine Lhamon, an assistant secretary in the agency’s Office for Civil Rights, saying: ""All students deserve the opportunity to participate equally in school programs and activities – this is a basic civil right. Unfortunately, Township High School District 211 is not following the law because the district continues to deny a female student the right to use the girls’ locker room. The district can provide access to this student while also respecting all students’ privacy."" Our ruling Cruz said the ""federal government is going after school districts, trying to force them to let boys shower with little girls."" Cruz’s vision of schoolboys everywhere showering with girls grossly distorts the issue. The fact is the Obama administration has sided with transgender students seeking access to school facilities including locker rooms, holding that anything less would violate federal anti-discrimination requirements. Such conflicts — few and far between — haven’t had to do with the government wanting boys to shower with girls. We rate the claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

"['Climate Change', 'Florida', 'Barack Obama']","
Do the fish swim in the streets of Miami at high tide, as Barack Obama said in Paris?
","As the world watched President Barack Obama’s news conference about climate change, he drew on South Florida to illustrate a point about the impact -- and he zeroed in on fish. ""As the science around climate change is more accepted, as people start realizing that even today you can put a price on the damage that climate change is doing -- you go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets, you know, that -- there's a cost to that,"" Obama said at the climate change conference in Paris Dec. 1. That opened the floodgates to a question about whether there are truly fish in the streets. At a town hall event in Iowa, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush was among the skeptics: ""Obama said today the streets of Miami are flooded and fish are falling on them. I live there. I don’t know what he’s talking about.’’ So is it a tall tale that fish swim in the streets of Miami? It’s certainly not a regular occurrence. But some people, including a few public officials, say they have seen it. And most importantly, it has been caught on video. The source of Obama’s fish story Spokespersons for the White House sent us news articles from 2014 and 2015 about flooding from king tides in South Florida. (King tides, for those who aren’t familiar with the term, are the highest predicted high tides and happen once or twice a year on the Florida coast. They occur when the orbits and alignment of the Earth, moon, and sun combine to produce the greatest tidal effects of the year.) ""There were fish swimming in the street,"" John Morgan, a Delray Beach city official, told the Sun-Sentinel in October 2014 after a few inches of sea water accumulated without any rain. Morgan told PolitiFact that he has seen fish on Marine Way, a road in a low-lying area, as well as at Veterans Park. ""I have been with the city a couple years now, and I’ve probably seen the fish in the streets at least a half dozen times,"" said Morgan, who now heads up his city’s environmental department. A Hollywood resident, Robin Rorapaugh, told the Miami Herald’s Public Insight Network in October 2015 that king tides had grown in her neighborhood and that ""anyone who doubts climate change should witness the sea come through the storm drains — fish were swimming in the street."" We also found video evidence that supported Obama’s point. A Sept. 28 TV news report featured video showing a fish swimming on Cordova Road in Fort Lauderdale. ""Look at that,"" a bystander said. ""A mullet in the street."" Nancy Gassman, assistant public works director in Fort Lauderdale, told PolitiFact Florida that fish on the streets are a ""regular occurrence"" during high tide flooding in Las Olas Isles and Las Olas Boulevard. ""In past tidal flooding, I personally have seen fish in the streets,"" she said. Obama’s comments echoed a recent statement by former Vice President Al Gore, who told NPR in November: ""I was in Miami last month and fish from the ocean were swimming on some of the streets on a sunny day because it was a high tide. In Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale, many other places – that happens regularly."" Our efforts to reach Gore were unsuccessful. However, Miami Beach officials told PolitiFact that Gore’s comment stems from a tour during a conference about climate change that happened to coincide with the king tides. Miami Beach officials, including assistant city manager/public works director Eric Carpenter, showed Gore the impact of the tides on the state-owned Indian Creek Drive where the water washes over the sea wall onto the street. ""I absolutely saw the fish,"" Carpenter told PolitiFact. ""You can actually see the fish swimming out of the creek, past the mangrove trees that are there and into the street. I probably saw close to a dozen. They weren’t big fish, but I don’t know, two or three inches long?"" While working on temporary fixes to the road to try to alleviate flooding, Carpenter said he saw the fish on several occasions. ""It was not an isolated incident,"" he said. Flooding has become an expensive problem for places such as Miami Beach, which flood for several days twice a year as a result of king tides. The coastal city is on track to spend around $500 million to install 80 pumps and raise roads and seawalls across the city. The Herald reported that while the city has flooded for decades during king tides, it has been getting worse. ""The king tides have gotten higher in recent years,"" said Colin Polsky, director of the center for environmental studies at Florida Atlantic University, told the Herald. ""And the king tides we're seeing more recently have been higher than they were predicted to be."" It’s important to point out that sightings of fish in the street are not common. Hollywood City Commissioner Patty Asseff, who lives across the street from the intracoastal, said she had never heard of fish in the streets. ""It was the first I had heard about fish in the streets,"" she told PolitiFact after reading Obama’s comments about Miami. ""We have water, we have flooding, but fish I haven’t seen yet."" In the past year, the city of Hollywood has spent more than $1 million on flood gates and pumps in parts of the city to alleviate flooding. For the record, Obama’s statement was technically about Miami -- not Miami Beach. Miami public works director Eduardo Santamaria said he wasn’t aware of fish on the streets in Miami, but he said the city is higher than Miami Beach and parts of Fort Lauderdale and Hollywood. Our ruling Obama said, ""You go down to Miami and when it's flooding at high tide on a sunny day, fish are swimming through the middle of the streets."" This reminds us of the fishing stories you might hear from your uncle.  Fish have been seen (and videotaped) on the streets. But that’s been in the low-lying areas that surround Miami, not on the streets in the city proper. And the sightings were during the more dramatic king tides, when high tides are at their highest, not during average daily high tides. Overall, we rate his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFBC0D80>],/factchecks/2015/dec/04/barack-obama/do-fish-swim-streets-miami-high-tide-barack-obama-/

Even with global warming 'propaganda,' Americans carpooling less, driving SUVs, George Will says
","The two-week climate conference now under way in Paris, where President Barack Obama hopes for an international agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, has generated attacks from conservatives such as syndicated columnist George Will. On Nov. 30, 2015, the first day of the United Nations gathering, Will made a two-part claim that we want to check. He made the statement on Fox News’ ""Special Report,"" and it was replayed the next day by Milwaukee radio talk show host Charlie Sykes, whose guests are nearly always fellow conservatives. Despite 30 years of ""propaganda"" about global warming, Will stated, ""fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980. SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country. The American people may profess occasionally to be concerned about global warming, but their behavior tells you that none of this propaganda has had any effect."" The size of the cars Americans drive and how often they carpool are only two ways in which people produce greenhouse gases -- those such as carbon dioxide from vehicles that trap heat in the atmosphere and, scientists believe, contribute to global warming. But let’s see how clean Will’s claim is. Greenhouse gases A little first on greenhouse gases. When Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker stated in September 2015 that the Obama administration’s own Environmental Protection Agency has said its Clean Power Plan ""will have a marginal impact on climate change"" (Half True), we noted that the United States and China are considered the world’s top greenhouse gas polluters. And as PolitiFact National reported the same month, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has said it is ""extremely likely"" that humans are causing climate change, and ""very likely"" that greenhouses gases are the driver.   We’ve also noted that according to the EPA, greenhouse gas emissions from vehicles in the United States amount to 27 percent of all sources of greenhouse gases, second only to electric power generation. Now to the first part of Will’s claim. Carpooling The latest census figures show that slightly more than 9 percent of Americans carpooled to work in 2014. As Will suggested, that’s down from nearly 20 percent in 1980, which was the first census to survey about carpooling. Driving alone rose from 64.4 percent to 76.5 percent. Among the reasons, according to experts: The rate of car ownership has risen, work schedules are less predictable, more people work from home and busier Americans want more freedom in managing their commutes with other tasks, such as getting kids to soccer practice. The other part of Will’s statement, however, goes off road a bit. SUVs We’ll note that, strictly speaking, there are traditional sport-utility vehicles, such as the Jeep Grand Cherokee and Dodge Durango, which are built on a truck platform; and the newer crossover-utility vehicles, which are built on a car chassis. They include the Honda CR-V and the Buick Encore. Traditional SUVs peaked with a 17 percent market share in 2002, according to the Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Center for Automotive Research, an independent research group. In 2014, they made up only 7.1 percent of all new vehicle sales. But many people, as well as automotive experts, refer to both types of vehicles simply as SUVs. The car site Edmunds.com told us that SUVs have reached their highest-ever market share in 2015, at 35.5 percent of sales. And the Center for Automotive Research provided us similar figures. In 2014, traditional SUVs and crossovers accounted for 34 percent of new-vehicle sales, as high as any year going back to 1995. Our rating Will said that despite attention on global warming, ""fewer Americans carpool today to work than carpooled in 1980"" and ""SUVs have never been a larger proportion of the vehicles being sold in this country."" Will is correct on carpooling to work and essentially correct on SUVs, when taking into account both traditional SUVs and the smaller crossover vehicles. But it’s worth noting that the market share for the traditional SUVs is down from its peak in 2002. We rate the statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097423700>],/factchecks/2015/dec/04/george-will/even-global-warming-propaganda-americans-carpoolin/
"['Children', 'Poverty', 'California', 'Common Sense Kids Action']","
Does California have the most children in poverty?
"," A coalition of health and education advocates wants to keep alive an income tax on the wealthiest Californians through an extension of part of Proposition 30. Voters approved that measure in 2012 to pay for schools and balance the state’s budget. The income tax is due to expire in 2019. Common Sense Kids Action, a child advocacy group, stated in September that the tax on the wealthy should be extended, citing continued health and education needs for California’s large number of impoverished children. ""California has more kids in poverty and greater income inequality than virtually any other state. The Invest in California’s Children Act asks the wealthiest to pay a little more so we can make the investments every California kid needs to have a great start in life,"" the advocacy group said. It said this in a press release unveiling one of multiple proposals to extend Proposition 30 that California voters will likely decide in November 2016. Here, we wanted to fact-check whether California has more kids in poverty than any other state, an eye-opening claim.  Staff at Sacramento Food Bank & Family Services help clients in north Sacramento. Photo by Andrew Nixon/Capital Public Radio Our research The facts are pretty clear: California does have the most children under the age of 18 in poverty at 2.05 million, according to the most recent U.S. Census Bureau report on the topic. That’s far more than Texas, the state with the next highest number of children in poverty with about 1.7 million. ""The fact that the state has the most children in poverty is mainly driven by the fact that it is the most populous state,"" said Caroline Danielson, who studies poverty at the Public Policy Institute of California (PPIC), a nonpartisan research group. At nearly 39 million, California’s population dwarfs second place Texas, which is home to about 27 million people. Third place Florida, with its nearly 20 million people, has about 650,000 children in poverty. To get a deeper understanding of child poverty in California, we wanted to see what percent of the state’s children are impoverished and how that compares with other states. The answer, it turns out, is hard to find and depends on what poverty measurement you look at. The census bureau’s standard reports show 22.7 percent of California’s children live in poverty. But fourteen other states had higher child poverty rates. The top three are New Mexico at 29.5 percent; Mississippi at 29.4 percent; and Louisiana at 27.9 percent, according to the bureau. California ranks as the most impoverished state in the bureau’s ""supplemental poverty measure,"" which researchers consider more meaningful because it accounts for cost of living. That measure, however, does not distinguish between child and adult poverty. To hone in on the state’s child poverty rate, PPIC, created a California Poverty Measure. Through that analysis, which takes into account cost of living and government assistance programs, PPIC found California’s child poverty rate for 2012 was 24.9 percent, higher than the census bureau’s rate. The institute only studied California’s child poverty rate, so we can’t compare it with other states. And if that comparison were possible? ""I would suspect that California’s child poverty rate would be in the top five in the nation,"" Danielson said. Our ruling Common Sense Kids Action says ""California has more kids in poverty ... than virtually any state."" The census bureau shows in its most recent standard report that California, indeed, has more people under 18 in poverty than any other state. But that doesn’t necessarily mean California has a bigger problem with child poverty — per capita — than all other states. There are 14 states, led by New Mexico and Mississippi, with higher child poverty rates, at least by the official measure.   In conclusion, the statement is literally accurate. But it should be noted that California’s population is so large it leads the nation in practically everything. We rate the claim Mostly True.

Can the Milwaukee County executive sell airport, zoo and museum on his own, without County Board OK?
","The two Milwaukee Democrats sparring in the race for Milwaukee County executive are both busy talking about the incumbent, Chris Abele. The millionaire philanthropist, elected in 2011 to succeed Scott Walker, is touting his accomplishments -- claiming he balanced the county budget ""without raising taxes five years in a row"" (Half True), and that 1 million route-miles have been added to the bus system without a fare increase (Mostly True). Meanwhile, the leading challenger, state Sen. Chris Larson, has cast Abele as out of touch -- and too powerful. Larson, who was a member of the county Board of Supervisors before Abele took office, won election to the Senate in 2010 after defeating a Democratic incumbent. On the Nov. 22, 2015 ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" public affairs TV show, Larson decried the power Abele he has gained at the expense of the County Board, which is essentially moving to part-time status as a result of a 2014 voter referendum. With the referendum, which Abele supported, salaries for the 18 County Board supervisors will be cut in half following the April 2016 elections. In addition, the supervisors’ health insurance will end and no additional pension benefits will be accrued. Gousha asked Larson whether a full-time County Board is better than a part-time board. Larson answered by making a claim we want to check, as well as a reference to rapper-producer Kanye West. ""I do understand that there’s a lot of people who don’t like the County Board. I’d also understand that there’s people who don’t like Congress,"" Larson said. ""The difference I have is that I don’t think we should abolish Congress, or abolish the legislative check and balance that we have in American-style democracy."" Then Larson alluded to a recent change in state law that gives more power to the Milwaukee County executive, saying: ""If anything, I think we've erred too far in giving all this power to one individual, including land sales. He has unilateral authority over the County Board -- or, the County Board has no oversight over land sales, including the museum, the airport and the zoo. That's just scary to think what he could do with that. And to paraphrase Kanye West: No one man should have all that power."" So -- not that it's likely -- but does the Milwaukee County executive have the power, on his own, to sell the Milwaukee Public Museum, General Mitchell International Airport and the Milwaukee County Zoo. All without approval from the County Board? The law In July 2015, while making final adjustments to the 2015-’17 state budget, GOP lawmakers inserted a provision to eliminate the Milwaukee County Board’s oversight of sales of county-owned properties that are not zoned for park use. County Board members made power-grab allegations against Abele who, despite being a Democrat, has forged alliances with some Republicans. The budget provision helped clear the way for Abele to sell 10 acres of land that is envisioned as part of a downtown Milwaukee development coinciding with a new arena for the Milwaukee Bucks basketball team. Now to Larson’s claim. Under the change in state law, any sale of non-park land owned by Milwaukee County requires the approval of only one other person besides the county executive -- either the elected county comptroller or a real estate expert who lives in the community where the land is located and who does not hold public office. That expert is appointed by the Milwaukee County Intergovernmental Cooperation Council, which is made up of elected representatives from the various cities and villages in the county. In other words, the County Board doesn’t have a say, although the county executive alone couldn’t sell non-park land, such as the museum, the airport or the zoo. The county’s top attorney, Corporation Counsel Paul Bargren, confirmed in a memo to the County Board that county-owned land that isn’t zoned for parks can be sold without the board’s OK. ""Specifically, the executive could lease, sell or convey any non-park county property regardless of board policy and without board approval,"" he wrote. Either the comptroller or the appointed real estate expert would have to determine that the sale ""is in the best interests of the county."" Bargren noted that counties are considered an arm of the state. And that the state Legislature can delegate or remove powers from county boards in all 72 counties and can, as it did in this case, treat one county differently than the others. ""In effect, the Legislature has inserted itself in place of the (Milwaukee) County Board and, as a matter of county policy, has delegated administration of land sales and contracts and procurement to the executive,"" his memo says. Our rating Larson said the Milwaukee County executive can sell the public ""museum, the airport and the zoo"" -- all on his own, without County Board approval. A recent change in state law that applies only to Milwaukee County allows the executive to sell any county-owned land not zoned as park land without approval of the County Board. However, such sales would need the OK of at least one other person -- either the elected county comptroller or a real estate expert appointed by elected municipal officials who lives in the community where the land is located. We rate Larson’s statement Mostly True. More on Milwaukee County In Milwaukee County, juveniles arrested for car theft ""get sent immediately home, because under the point system in juvenile court"" on holding suspects, ""a stolen car gets zero points.""

Hillary Clinton's exaggerated claim that Ted Cruz 'tried to ban contraception' five times
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton called out Republican rival Ted Cruz for a contradiction on contraception after Cruz made a widely aired comment about condoms on his college campus. It started when Cruz mocked a consistent charge from Democrats that Republicans are against birth control during a Nov. 30, 2015, campaign stop in Bettendorf, Iowa. ""Last I checked,"" Cruz said, ""we don’t have a rubber shortage in America. Look, when I was in college, we had a machine in the bathroom, you put 50 cents in and voila. So, yes, anyone who wants contraceptives can access them, but it’s an utter made-up nonsense issue."" The Clinton campaign didn’t think much of his comment, challenging Cruz with a post on its website headlined, ""Ted Cruz says no one's trying to ban contraception. Here are 5 times Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception."" It added, ""Cruz has personally tried to make it harder for women to get birth control."" The post’s fine print includes more nuanced language than the headline lets on -- that Cruz is ""trying to limit access to contraception,"" ""tried to make it harder for women to get birth control,"" and is pursuing policies that ""could ban some forms of birth control."" The details in the softened (and more accurate) statements are lost in the blaring headline that Cruz ""tried to ban contraception"" five times."" None of the Clinton campaign’s examples supports the idea that Cruz seeks a flat-out ban on contraception. The Clinton campaign took issue with our characterization of the post, saying that they never meant for the headline to say that Cruz tried to ban all contraceptives on five separate occasions. However, we think ours is the most obvious interpretation of the language in question. 1. ""The time he supported a so-called personhood amendment, which could criminalize abortion and could ban some forms of birth control."" This example offers the most support for Cruz trying to ban contraception, but it still overreaches. Cruz signed a ""personhood affirmation"" circulated by Georgia Right to Life this summer that commits him to a ""human life amendment"" to the U.S. Constitution that would define life as beginning at fertilization. As we have noted, the impact of such proposed ""personhood"" amendments on birth control is in dispute. Opponents, along with some legal scholars and medical organizations, say that giving a fertilized egg all the rights of a person could make several FDA-approved contraceptives illegal. But that would depend on how courts interpret personhood. A ""personhood"" provision has not yet passed at the federal or state level. Even more complicated is the meaning of ""fertilization,"" according to a 2011 op-ed in the New York Times by Glenn Cohen, co-director of Harvard University’s Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics, and Jonathan Will, law professor at Mississippi College. Fertilization, they wrote, could mean at least four different things: ""penetration of the egg by a sperm,"" successful combination of the genetic information from sperm and egg, activation of the genetic information, or implantation of the embryo in the uterus, Cohen and Will wrote. Sperm penetration occurs almost immediately, but implantation can take up to two weeks. ""Thus, on some reasonable readings of the amendment, certain forms of birth control ... would seem impermissible, while on other equally reasonable readings they are not."" A relatively narrow judicial interpretation could allow the use of the pill and intrauterine devices, or IUDs, while a broader interpretation may not. But even if an enacted personhood amendment was interpreted by judges in the most expansive fashion possible, it would still not limit spermicides and -- notably given Cruz’s comments -- condoms, since these prevent fertilization from taking place at all. So the first of Clinton’s examples holds some plausibility as supporting evidence for her overall claim, but it’s overly broad in suggesting that Cruz would ban all contraception and more speculative than she lets on. 2. ""The time he was willing to shut down the government to cut funding from Planned Parenthood."" Cruz was indeed willing to shut down the federal government if lawmakers and President Barack Obama maintained federal funding of Planned Parenthood. (Combined, state and federal funding accounts for about 41 percent of Planned Parenthood’s yearly revenue, or about $528 million, according to the group’s most recent annual report.) ""It will be a decision of the president's and the president's alone whether he would veto funding for the federal government because of a commitment to ensuring taxpayer dollars continue to flow to what appears to be a national criminal organization,"" Cruz said in August 2015. But even if this shutdown had happened -- and it didn’t -- the result would have been more indirect than an attempted ban on contraception. At most, it might have hampered the ability of individuals to receive contraceptives from one specific provider, albeit a significant one. 3. ""The time he called for the Supreme Court to turn women’s personal health decisions over to their employers by striking down the Obamacare birth control co-pay provision"" in the Hobby Lobby ruling. In Burwell vs. Hobby Lobby, the Supreme Court ruled 5-4 that a closely held, private corporation could decline on religious grounds to pay for certain kinds of contraceptives otherwise mandated in employee health coverage by the Affordable Care Act. Hobby Lobby’s Christian owners said they objected to four of 20 Food and Drug Administration-approved forms of contraception that prevent implantation of the embryo. These include two forms of emergency contraception, also known as the morning-after pill, and two forms of intra-uterine devices, or IUDs. (The FDA considers these four methods to be contraception, but the company’s owners consider them to be a form of abortion.) The way the decision was written leaves some question about whether closely held, religious companies can choose to opt out of supporting any of the remaining 16 forms of contraception in their health plans. Already, some companies have been allowed by lower courts to stop paying for a wider range of contraceptives than were at issue in the Hobby Lobby case, though some of those cases are still working their way through the courts. Still, Cruz’s support for the Hobby Lobby decision does not by itself mean that he supports banning all contraceptives. First, the case involved employer co-payments for contraceptives, making it financially harder but not impossible for an individual to obtain contraceptives. And second, that case involved only four of the 20 FDA-approved contraceptives; whether the Supreme Court might some day support a broader interpretation that permits closely held companies to opt out of all contraceptives remains to be seen. 4. ""The time he tried to get rid of a law that made it so women couldn’t be fired for their personal reproductive decisions (including birth control)."" The Washington, D.C., law in question -- the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014 -- says employers cannot use their personal beliefs to discriminate against an employee for his or her reproductive health choices. Cruz took issue with the law in his capacity as a member of Congress, which is allowed a 30-day period to object to D.C. laws. (Congressional opponents were unable to derail the law, which would have also required the cooperation of Obama.) The potential to be fired or demoted from a job for using contraception is a heavy penalty. Still, opposing this bill is not the same thing as advocating for a ban on contraception. 5. ""And the time he used a medically and scientifically incorrect argument to try to ban emergency contraception."" The Clinton campaign cites an article in the liberal publication Salon.com that takes Cruz to task for saying that the federal government wants to make private companies (like those in the Hobby Lobby case) provide ""abortifacients"" to employees. The article draws a distinction between abortifacients, such as the pill RU-486, and ""emergency contraceptives"" that may be taken up to three days after unprotected sex. The medical community also draws a distinction between the two methods. The Association of Reproductive Health Professionals, for instance, writes that RU-486 ""ends pregnancy"" whereas emergency contraception ""prevent(s) unintended pregnancy."" The group states flatly that ""emergency contraception is not the same as medical abortion."" A potential gray area -- emphasized by anti-abortion advocates -- is that emergency contraception may take effect after fertilization has already taken place. Regardless of how early that occurs, this is enough for some abortion opponents to classify it as causing a pregnancy to be aborted. Setting aside this difference of opinion, it’s not clear that this example supports Clinton’s overall point that Cruz has sought to ""ban contraception."" By focusing on ""emergency contraception,"" it addresses Cruz’s position on one type of contraception but not all types. Our ruling The post on Clinton’s website claims ""Ted Cruz tried to ban contraception"" five times. There’s little doubt that Cruz is a strong opponent of abortion, and as such, he and other anti-abortion advocates find certain types of contraception objectionable. But the Clinton campaign’s examples don’t exactly show Cruz trying to push across-the-board bans on contraception. The strongest conclusion about Cruz’s views that one could draw from these examples is that he might support a ban on certain types of contraception (but not all) through his support for a personhood amendment. The other examples are even more limited and deal with what employers would be required to pay for, for instance, or whether a major birth control provider should continue to receive federal funding. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A35E100>],/factchecks/2015/dec/02/hillary-clinton/hillary-clintons-exaggerated-claim-ted-cruz-tried-/
"['Health Care', 'PunditFact', 'Bill Maher']","
Bill Maher: Cancer drugs cost $10,000 a month
","Patients used to pay $10,000 a year for cancer drugs, but now they’re paying $10,000 a month, according to HBO talk show host Bill Maher. That’s a message circulating on Facebook recently, promoted by the ""Bill Maher Fanpage."" A reader asked us to check it out. The quote comes from the Oct. 2 episode of Real Time with Bill Maher, where Maher discussed Turing Pharmaceuticals, the company that jacked up the cost of a life-saving drug from $13.50 to $750 essentially overnight. ""Not that (Turing CEO Martin) Shkreli is unusual for the pharmaceutical industry,"" Maher said on his show. ""Fifteen years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it’s $10,000 a month because this cartel owns the U.S. government every bit as much as Mexican drug lords own theirs."" It’s well known that the cost of health care is on the rise, but has the annual cost of cancer drugs really increased so dramatically in just a decade and a half? Maher’s team sent us links to some news articles about the rising cost of cancer drugs, and we tracked down information that speaks to his claim. The best information we could nail down is the cost of anticancer drugs at launch, the initial price when the Federal Drug Administration approves a drug. These are the sticker prices set by the pharmaceutical companies, not the prices patients actually pay out of pocket, which are reduced by insurance payments, patient assistance programs and other discounts. Costs increases, though, are often passed on to consumers. Maher has a point that cancer drug costs are on the rise. We charted the launch costs of cancer drugs the FDA approved since 1999, using a list compiled by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.  The second half of Maher’s statement -- that cancer drugs now cost about $10,000 a month -- is also on solid ground. Of drugs approved in 2015, the monthly average cost is $11,319. And experts in the field often cite that $10,000 figure themselves. Because many cancer drugs are not administered to patients for a full year, it’s difficult to determine an average annual cost, so the first half of Maher’s statement -- that they cost about $10,000 a year 15 years ago -- is hard to nail down. To his point, though, the monthly cost of a new drug was dramatically lower in 2000 than what it is now at about $4,634. One of the news articles that Maher’s team sent us is an academic article in the Journal of Oncology Practice that supports his statement. The report reads, ""The average cancer drug price for approximately one year of therapy or a total treatment duration was less than $10,000 before 2000."" Maher’s statement is ""in the ballpark,"" if not an understatement, said Rena Conti, a health economist at the University of Chicago who researches cancer drug prices. In a 2015 paper Conti authored with three other leading health economists, she examined the launch cost of anticancer drugs controlled for inflation and the benefit to the patient (how much it prolongs life expectancy). For example, in 1995, anticancer drugs cost $54,100 for an additional year of life, the study found. In 2005, drugs cost $139,100 for the same benefit, and the price grew to $207,000 in 2013. In the United States, pharmaceutical companies set their own drug prices. What’s pushing them to increase the costs? It’s not necessarily that cancer drugs are getting better and are thus worth more. Conti’s research concluded that just about one-fifth of the cancer drug cost increase can be attributed to a better product. There are two primary forces behind annual cancer drug cost increases, Conti said: First, pharmaceutical companies estimate a ""zone of indifference"" -- based on last year’s prices, how much more would buyers be willing to pay? Second, rebates and discounts for drugs have also increased over time, and this creates an incentive for drug companies to increase their costs alongside the discounts. Pharmaceutical companies defend drug price increases by emphasizing that the revenue funds innovative research and that drugs lower overall health care costs by treating illnesses. Because there’s no formal price regulation and competition in the industry is rare, ""It really is a system where there’s no downward pressure on drug prices,"" said Peter Bach, director of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Center for Health Policy and Outcomes in an interview with Fortune. Our ruling Maher said, ""15 years ago, cancer drugs cost an average of $10,000 a year. Now it’s $10,000 a month."" The average annual cost of a drug isn’t easy to calculate, given the way cancer drugs are scheduled; many drugs aren’t used every month for an entire year. So the first half of the statement is hard to verify, though we did find one academic source that cites a similar figure. However, Maher has a point that the cost of cancer drugs has increased dramatically since 2000, when the average monthly price of a cancer drug, when it first hit the market, was about $4,600. In 2015, the monthly cost is over $10,000. Maher’s numbers are a little squishy, but they’re in the ballpark. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097130D00>],/factchecks/2015/dec/02/bill-maher/bill-maher-cancer-drugs-cost-10000-month/

Ron Johnson “Probably less than 4 percent” of Wisconsin residents using Obamacare subsidies
","Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson isn’t shy about his dislike for the Affordable Care Act. So when conservative radio host Charlie Sykes asked him in an interview Nov. 5, 2015 for his take on what’s commonly known as Obamacare, Johnson was ready. ""We haven’t heard a lot of Republicans talking about Obamacare,"" Sykes said. ""I think that there was an assumption that, you know, once Obamacare was implemented, that people would just decide they like it, it would become entrenched, and therefore it would fade as a political issue. ""That is just not happening, is it?"" ""Well,"" Johnson replied, ""unless you are one of those individuals — in Wisconsin it’s probably less than 4 percent of the population — that are enjoying the subsidies, you’re getting harmed by Obamacare."" In 2013, we checked a Johnson claim about Obamacare -- that premiums for ""an average plan for a family didn’t go down by $2,500 per year, it’s gone up about $2,500 per year."" We rated that Half True, as Johnson correctly cited rising premium costs, but experts said the evidence that Obamacare affected the increase was thin. Let’s see if he hit the numbers this time. Background on the system After the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, states could create their own marketplaces for health care or use the ones established by the federal government. Wisconsin is one of more than 30 states that chose to not set up its own online marketplace. Insurance subsidies are available under the law for people with incomes between 100 and 400 percent of the federal poverty threshold who are not offered what is considered affordable health insurance through an employer. In 2015, that income level is $11,770 for an individual and $95,400 for a family of four in Wisconsin. In June 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld a provision of the ACA that helps low- and middle-income people buy health care in the federal marketplace with subsidies. That is the provision Johnson was referring to when he said ""probably less than 4 percent"" of Wisconsin residents ""are enjoying the subsidies"" from Obamacare. Looking at the subsidies When asked for backup for his claim, Johnson’s team pointed to data from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nationally respected authority on health care and population information. The Kaiser report pulled its data from a U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services report on enrollment in Affordable Care Act marketplaces. It also shows the number of people receiving premium subsidies in each state as of March 31, 2015. How do the numbers break down for Wisconsin? According to the Kaiser report, 166,142 people received subsidies to help pay premiums as of March 2015. About 20,000 more Wisconsinites are enrolled in the marketplace, but don’t receive financial assistance. By this tally, 90.7 percent of those enrolled in ACA coverage in Wisconsin receive subsidies. The most recent Census Bureau estimate puts the state’s population at 5,757,564. By those numbers, 2.9 percent of Wisconsin residents are receiving the subsidies. For a national perspective, we turn to a PolitiFact Georgia fact check of a claim by Republican U.S. Rep. Austin Scott of Georgia. Scott claimed 97 percent of Americans do not receive subsidies for health care under the Affordable Care Act. The Kaiser report showed about 9 million people receive federal and state subsidies to buy insurance. In comparison to the estimated U.S. population of about 318 million, that’s just about 3 percent. Johnson said, ""probably less than 4 percent"" of Wisconsin residents ""are enjoying the subsidies"" from Obamacare. He calculated this figure based on enrollment data and Census Bureau population statistics. Those numbers put the figure at 2.9 percent.

Health officials right about drop in AIDS-related deaths
","Just before commemorating World AIDS Day on Tuesday, Fulton County’s health department released some rare good news on its efforts against the disease. Citing a report from an independent program of the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the press release said the number of people dying here from HIV-related diseases plunged 59 percent between 2004 and 2012. ""Fewer people are dying from HIV/AIDS in metro Atlanta, in part, due to our Integrated Care Service Delivery of services,"" Dr. David Holland, chief clinical officer of Fulton’s Communicable Disease Prevention Branch, said in the release. Could this be the same department that had to give back between $7 and 8.7 million of $20 million in federal grant money because it didn’t have enough programs to help stop the spread of HIV? And are deaths declining even though at least a quarter of all new HIV diagnoses in Atlanta are for people who have already developed AIDS? PolitiFact Georgia was skeptical. The numbers The 27th anniversary of World AIDS Day comes at a time when both the rate of HIV infection and AIDS-related deaths are on a global decline. Effective antiretroviral drugs can control HIV and help those with the disease live longer lives. As of June, 15.8 million people were receiving antiretroviral treatment. Worldwide, that has pushed down new HIV infections, which have fallen by 35 percent since 2000, and deaths, which have fallen 42 percent since a peak in 2004. The 2015 report from NACCHO’s Big Cities Health Coalition examines health data from the nation’s 27 largest cities and counties, including a look at more local HIV and AIDS figures. According to the Big Cities Health Inventory report, released in late November, cities experienced new cases of HIV and HIV-related deaths in higher numbers compared with the rest of the country. But Atlanta (as reported by Fulton County’s health department) and every other city except Detroit saw drops, some significant, in mortality rates since the last report. Atlanta had the fourth highest mortality rate of the cities, with 24.1 deaths per 100,000 people in 2004, according to the report. In 2012, the last year data was available for a majority of the cities, the rate was 9.8 – a 59 percent drop just as Fulton touted in the press release. Data from Georgia’s Department of Public Health back up those figures on the mortality rate and also provide the specific numbers of deaths. The number of people dying annually from HIV/AIDS in Fulton County dropped from 195 to 96 in those eight years, a 51 percent decline. Further bolstering Fulton’s claim are figures showing continued drops in deaths for the past two years. By 2014, 80 people in Fulton had died from HIV or AIDS, a rate of 8 percent. That’s a 59 percent decline by number or a 66.8 percent decrease in rate from the peak a decade ago. Statewide, HIV/AIDS deaths also declined during this period by 47 percent said Nancy Nydam, spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Public Health. The state death rate from HIV/AIDS was 7.9 per 100,000 in 2004 and 4.2 in 2012, a 47 percent drop, she said. The context All of this is to say, Fulton is on target with its figures. Missing from the press release, though, was the context that Atlanta remains in the top 5 cities for HIV-related deaths (and top 3 for new infections). And, its 10 per 100,000 mortality rate is five times greater than the national average of 2. ""It’s a big improvement but obviously some big improvements still need to be made,"" said Chrissie Juliano, director of the Big Cities Health Coalition. ""We know from other sources that challenges remain in Atlanta-Fulton County regarding HIV and AIDS."" Fulton is making headway. It completed an internal audit in October that found mismanagement and bureaucratic delays cost it the nearly $9 million in federal money to fight HIV. It has since replaced the health department director and strengthened oversight of its grants. Patrick Sullivan, an epidemiologist at Emory University’s Rollins School of Public Health, cautioned against reading too much into Atlanta’s ranking in comparison to national mortality rates. He added that it would not be ""informative"" to directly compare Atlanta, or any city, to the overall U.S. rates on HIV mortality. ""HIV-related deaths are much higher in cities, because people living with HIV are more concentrated in cities,"" Sullivan said.  ""The high HIV-related mortality rate reflects the high impact of HIV in Atlanta."" Our ruling At a time when new HIV infections and AIDS-related deaths are down globally, Fulton County touted a report that showed its mortality rate dropped 59 percent from a peak in 2004. The report, and state data, back up the dramatic decline. While Atlanta remains in the top five cities in the nation for such deaths and still struggles with executing prevention programs, it also has seen the mortality rate drop since the report.

Bush says law requires religious screening of refugees
","The probability that terrorists would try to take advantage of the refugee wave landing in Europe has led many Republicans and some Democrats to call for tighter policies here at home. Republican candidate Jeb Bush has rejected one of the more hard-line proposals that would ban all Syrian Muslim refugees from entering the United States. But Bush has said that America ought to give priority to Christians fleeing the ravages of religious militants under the command of the Islamic State. Asked on CBS News’ Face the Nation if a Christian preference wouldn’t play into the ISIL narrative that their war was a struggle between Islam and Christianity, Bush said this wouldn’t represent any real change. ""It is already in the law that there is a requirement to screen for religion,"" Bush said Nov. 29, 2015. ""This is the practice of our country. There was a bipartisan bill that of course didn't pass in Congress this year to provide preference for Christians who are being slaughtered in the Middle East, persecuted based on their faith. Religious minorities, I think, should have some preference."" We decided to look at whether American officials are legally bound to ask refugees about their religion. The short answer is, it depends. If a refugee says he or she fears religious persecution, then their religion absorbs a lot of time in the interview process. But if their fear stems from their political views, then there is no obligation to ask about their religion. Still, experts said it is standard practice to ask refugees about their religion, even if they are not specifically escaping religious persecution. The Bush press office pointed us to an opinion piece in the National Review that paraphrased the relevant part of the Immigration and Nationality Act (section 101(a)(42)) this way: ""An alien applying for admission must establish that … religion [among other things] … was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant."" The full list of possible grounds for persecution includes ""race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion."" A State Department spokesperson told PolitiFact that there is no legal requirement for refugees to indicate a religious preference. But if they make religion the basis of their claim, then many questions about their religious background follow. In some particular cases, the State Department designates certain groups as ones of ""special humanitarian concern"" and in the past, religion has helped define such groups. Examples include Soviet Jews and Iranian religious minorities. For those special groups, religion is an essential aspect of the person’s background, said Mark Hetfield, president of HIAS, a refugee assistance group that began over a century ago to help Jews fleeing Eastern Europe. (HIAS today works with people of any faith from around the world and has worked with both the UN and the State Department to help refugees.) ""But this is not due to a legal requirement,"" he said. ""This is to see if they fit in the parameters of the program."" A standard practice Most refugees begin their formal path to resettlement with an interview conducted by staff of the United Nations High Commission on Refugees. If a person is headed toward the United States, their next stop is a Resettlement Support Center overseen by the U.S. State Department. According to the department’s press office, the resettlement centers routinely ask about religion. Hetfield affirmed that. ""There is a data field for religion which is always filled in,"" he said. ""If it is not directly relevant to the claim, U.S Citizenship and Immigration (staff) won't ask about it, but it will be in the applicant's file."" We reached Bill Frelick, director of the refugee rights program at Human Rights Watch, when he was in Bulgaria interviewing Syrian, Iraqi and Afghan asylum seekers. Frelick said religious affiliation is a typical but optional question for refugees. The practitioners we reached found Bush’s emphasis on the legal dimension of asking about religion problematic. To them, simply asking is not screening. It provides information that might ease a refugee’s transition to life in America and finding a place of worship. Screening in the sense of vetting takes place only when the refugee says he or she fears religious persecution. Refugees are tracked based on the countries they have fled, not their religion, so we don’t know the fraction of refugees claiming religious persecution. Anecdotally, religion plays a role in many refugee applications in the Middle East, whether the person is Sunni or Shia Muslim, Christian, Jewish, Baha'i, or some other faith. Our ruling Bush said that there is a legal requirement to screen for religion. U.S. immigration law does state that American officials must dig into a person’s religion if their refugee status is based on a fear of religious persecution. However, there is no formal requirement if the person bases the claim on other grounds. In practice, questions about religion are common even if they are not required.

Identifying Middle Eastern Christians can be harder than Bush suggests
","Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush has said the United States should give preference to Christians fleeing the bloodshed in the Middle East. While many Americans and lawmakers view Muslims with suspicion, Bush argued this should not impede providing shelter to people of various Christian sects. This raises the question of how resettlement workers would be able to verify that the person who claims to be a Christian actually is one. In an interview on radio station WGIR in New Hampshire, Bush said there are many telltale signs. ""You can tell when someone is a Christian in the Middle East, I can promise you that,"" Bush said on NH Today. ""By name, by where they’re born, their birth certificates. There are ample means by which to know this."" We thought we’d explore the markers of Christian identity in the Middle East. The Bush campaign did not provide more details, so we turned to specialists in Middle Eastern religion and society. Lucas Van Rompay, a professor of religious studies at Duke University, said it would not be easy to tell. ""Some Christians do have specifically Christian names, but many don’t,"" Van Rompay said. ""In addition, the Qur’an knows the biblical names of Abraham, Joseph, Jesus, Mary, etc. so these names may be found among Muslims. The place where people are born may be relevant in some cases, such as some entirely Christian villages in northern Iraq, but most Christians live in cities or areas which have a mixed population."" Father Patrick Ryan, a Jesuit priest and professor of religion and society at Fordham University echoed those points, noting that many Arabs deliberately choose ""ambiguous names so you won’t be able to identify them religiously."" Ryan added that whether a woman is veiled is also unreliable. ""Many (non-Muslim) women in the Middle East cover their heads and necks,"" Ryan said. On the other hand, he noted that some Coptic Christians have distinctive tatoos. Many refugees do have their birth certificates, and ones from Syria list the person’s religion. Still, Van Rompay said truly verifying that a person is what he says he is can take a long time. Middle Eastern Christians tend to be well integrated into their communities. ""Even sitting down with someone and having a conversation about some of the tenets of Christianity or some basic prayers (Our Father, the Creed) would be problematic,"" Van Rompay said. ""Middle Eastern Christians are as diverse as Western Christians are, and some will be much more knowledgeable than others, and much more able to express themselves than others."" Our ruling Bush said there are ample ways to determine if a Middle Eastern refugee is a Christian and suggested that names, birthplace and birth certificate would be key. The experts we reached agreed that there are many ways to verify that a person is a Christian, but they warned that it would be far more complicated than Bush presented. For many Christians, neither their names nor where they were born confirms their religion. A birth certificate could prove helpful, but if one doubted its authenticity, a more arduous verification task lies ahead. Based on what the experts said, Bush misrepresented the power of the indicators he mentioned and the effort needed to go beyond them. We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C13CC80>],/factchecks/2015/dec/01/jeb-bush/identifying-middle-eastern-christians-can-be-harde/

Donald Trump says President Obama wants the U.S. to take in 250,000 people from Syria
","Donald Trump, the hard-charging businessman who had been leading voter polls for the Republican presidential nomination, recently kicked off a rally in Beaumont with a moment of silence for the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks that left at least 129 dead. In the aftermath of the attacks, conflicting reports on the citizenship status of the perpetrators led 30 state governors and most of the Republican presidential candidates, including Trump, to speak out against Syrian refugees entering the United States. Trump began his Nov. 14, 2015, speech at Beaumont’s Ford Park Arena by calling the events in Paris the night before ""terrible."" He went on to say, ""And when you look at what happened in that case, it’s just reported, one from Syria. And our president wants to take in 250,000 from Syria,"" citing one of the Paris attacker’s alleged Syrian nationality. While the Syrian passport allegedly found next to the body of one of the attackers is believed to be fake and at least six out of the 10 known assailants are European nationals, Trump and others cited the Paris attacks as good reason to prohibit additional Syrian refugees from entering the United States. Trump was not alone in claiming President Barack Obama wants to allow hundreds of thousands of Syrians entry to the United States. Republican presidential hopeful Carly Fiorina put the number at 100,000 Syrian refugees and Ben Carson likened bringing 200,000 people ""from that region"" to malpractice. Trump had used the 250,000 figure before, telling Matt Lauer of NBC News he didn’t want that many Syrians coming to the United States. The United States has a long history of taking in refugees from war-torn countries, including some from Syria. But has President Obama decided to admit 250,000 Syrian refugees? Our attempts to learn the basis for Trump’s statement yielded no replies from his campaign. In October 2015, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity made a claim much like the one Trump offered in Beaumont, though Hannity mentioned another country as well, saying: ""The president said he’s going to bring in 250,000 (Syrian and Iraqi) refugees into this country."" Pants on Fire, PolitiFact ruled a week later, finding that Hannity lofted a figure not rooted in Obama administration plans, though there are plans to admit more refugees, including more Syrians, over several years. Hannity offered as backup for his claim a Sept. 20, 2015, Associated Press news story stating that the U.S. will accept 85,000 refugees from around the world next year, up from 70,000, and that total would rise to 100,000 in 2017, per Secretary of State John Kerry’s remarks. Hannity added up the total number of refugees allowed each year from all over the world, to get a total of 255,000 refugees. That AP story, however, said that those figures reflected refugees to be welcomed from around the world, not just Syria or even the Middle East. On Sept. 10, 2015, the Obama administration announced plans to increase the number of Syrian refugees to at least 10,000, although talk radio hosts such as Rush Limbaugh have claimed figures almost 10 times as high. We reached out to the White House for clarity. White House spokesman Eric Schultz sent back an email stating that the U.S. is increasing the ""number of Syrian and other refugees we admit from around the world on an annual basis,"" going up to 85,000 next year and 100,000 the following year. While Hannity further clarified his statement, that he didn’t say all would be Syrian refugees, Trump explicitly labeled all 250,000 as Syrian refugees. After searching other news stories, checking with the White House and searching some more, we did find that 250,000 figure out there on the Internet -- on a parody site called  Real News Right Now, which stated: ""The U.S. Department of State announced today that it will grant upwards of two-hundred and fifty thousand Syrian refugees temporary amnesty in the United States. Over the next four months, State Department officials working in conjunction with FEMA will begin processing and transporting the refugees to sparsely populated parts of Arizona and North Dakota."" It went on to quote Cathy Pieper, a spokesperson for the ""Department of State,"" the article said. We called the State Department to see if there was a spokesperson by that name; there isn’t. Refugee resettlement In September 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry shared the Obama administration’s plans to increase the total number of refugees coming into the United States from all countries from 70,000 to 85,000 in Fiscal Year 2016, with ""10,000 over the next year from Syria specifically,"" Kerry said. The following year, Kerry said the target would be closer to 100,000 total, again from all countries. Between Oct. 1, 2011 and Nov. 20, 2015, the U.S. resettled 2,261 Syrian refugees in 36 states, according to the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank that analyzes migration across the world. Michelle Mittelstadt, a spokesperson for the organization, wrote in an email that between the Obama administration’s announcement of accepting 10,000 Syrian refugees in Fiscal Year 2016 (part of the total increase to 85,000 refugees) and the plan to raise the overall refugee admissions ceiling in FY 2017 to 100,000, even if the entirety of the increase between Fiscal Years 2016 and 2017 were all Syrian refugees (the allotted number for Syrian refugees hasn’t been specified), that would permit admission of 25,000 Syrian refugees in FY 2017. ""We know of no proposal by the administration to admit 250,000 Syrian refugees,"" she said. According to a report submitted to Congress Oct. 1, 2015, the U.S. admitted between 1,600 and 1,800 Syrian refugees in FY 2015. The table below, from the Proposed Refugee Admissions for Fiscal Year 2016 report to Congress includes the number of actual arrivals for 2014 and 2015 from all areas of the world, and projected numbers for 2016:   Table I Refugee Admissions in FY 2014 and FY 2015 Proposed Refugee Admissions by Region for FY 2016[3] Region   FY 2014 Actual arrivals FY 2015 Ceiling   Revised FY 2015 Ceiling   FY 2015 projected arrivals   Proposed FY2016 Ceiling Africa 17,476 17,000 20,400 22,600 25,000 East Asia 14,784 13,000 17,300 18,200 13,000 Europe and Central Asia 959 1,000 2,300 2,350 4,000 Latin America/Caribbean 4,318 4,000 2,300 2,050 3,000 Near East/South Asia 32,450 33,000 27,700 24,800 34,000 Regional Subtotal 69,987 68,000 70,000 70,000 79,000 Unallocated Reserve   2,000     6,000 Total 69,987 70,000 70,000 70,000 85,000 
Our ruling Trump said President Obama wants to take in 250,000 people from Syria. If so, neither the administration or any other authoritative source had said as much before Trump stumped in Beaumont. If current plans hold, Syrian refugees settling here will increase through 2017, but it will be nothing close to the 250,000 figure touted by Trump. The administration has plans to increase refugees admitted from all countries from 70,000 in 2015 to 100,000 in 2017. Nothing close? We rate his claim Pants on Fire!

Are the 'overwhelming majority of violent criminals' Democrats? Ted Cruz said so
","During an interview with conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt, Republican presidential candidate Ted Cruz said most violent criminals are Democrats. It came after Hewitt brought up the shooting at a Planned Parenthood clinic that left three dead and nine injured in Colorado Springs, Colo., over Thanksgiving weekend. Hewitt told Cruz that he’d been doing anti-abortion events for 25 years and had never met ""a single pro-life activist who is in favor of violence of any sort."" Cruz agreed. ""And I would note that this whole episode has really displayed the ugly underbelly of the media,"" Cruz said. ""You know, every time you have some sort of violent crime or mass killing, you can almost see the media salivating, hoping, hoping desperately that the murderer happens to be a Republican, so they can use it to try to paint their political enemies. Now listen, here’s the simple and undeniable fact. The overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats. The media doesn’t report that."" We received dozens of emails from readers asking us to check the claim, so we took a closer look. We queried the Cruz campaign, but didn’t hear back. CNN reported that Cruz’s campaign, when asked, cited research by two academics, Marc Meredith, of the University of Pennsylvania, and Michael Morse, then of Stanford University. They published a paper in the January 2014 edition of the Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science titled, ""Do Voting Rights Notification Laws Increase Ex-Felon Turnout?"" (After we published our item, Cruz defended the statement to ABC News on the basis of that study.) The paper looked at the policy in some states of notifying newly released inmates about their ability to re-register to vote. The authors looked at data from New Mexico, New York and North Carolina and concluded that notification laws do not significantly increase rates of registration or voting among ex-felons. Cruz’s claim relies not on the general thrust of the paper but on some of the data contained within it. For instance, in New York, about one-third of felons released from prison registered to vote after their release. Of those, about 62 percent registered as Democrats and 9 percent registered as Republicans, with 26 percent registering as independents or with other parties. In North Carolina, about a quarter of those who were released registered after their release. Of those, 52 percent registered as Democrats, 19 percent as Republicans and 22 percent as independents or with other parties. And in New Mexico, 41 percent of those who were released registered to vote. Of those, 55 percent registered as Democrats, 10 percent as Republicans and 18 percent as independents or with other parties. So Cruz’s statement has some grounding in the research. But it significantly oversimplifies the case -- and introduces some inaccuracies. ""Cruz is misinterpreting our research,"" the authors told PolitiFact. Here’s a rundown of factors that should give anyone pause: • ""Violent"" vs. ""nonviolent."" Cruz said that ""the overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats."" But the paper didn’t break down their pool of ex-felons into those who had been incarcerated for violent offenses and those who had been incarcerated for nonviolent crimes. So the paper contains no support for this portion of Cruz’s claim. • A small sample of states. The paper focuses on three states out of 50, and the authors say it’s wrong to generalize from this small sample. In fact, in another academic paper, the same authors found that in Iowa, Maine and Rhode Island, the most common registration for discharged felons was not to affiliate with any party. ""Ex-felons’ partisan affiliations vary across states, and we don’t think there’s enough evidence to claim that the national ex-felon population is ‘overwhelmingly Democratic,’ at least in terms of party registration,"" the authors told us. • The paper studied ""ex-felons,"" not ""criminals."" Cruz’s statement makes it sound as if Democrats are committing crimes. That’s not what the paper measured. Rather, the paper found that once felons are released from prison, they are likelier to register as Democrats. The data in the paper doesn’t speak to whether they were Democrats (registered or otherwise) when committing crimes. • The study doesn’t address ex-felons who don’t register to vote. Half to two-thirds of the voters in these states didn’t register to vote. • It’s hard to separate these figures from overall demographics. It’s no secret that, statistically, African-Americans are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system. It’s also no secret that African-Americans are overwhelmingly Democratic. Put these two together and it’s not surprising to find higher percentages of Democratic registrations among ex-felons. Indeed, in a 2010 paper -- ""Did Disfranchisement Laws Help Elect President Bush? New Evidence on the Turnout Rates and Candidate Preferences of Florida’s Ex-Felons"" -- Traci Burch of Northwestern University found that African-American ex-felons did overwhelmingly register as Democrats. But the paper also found that white ex-felons did not follow the same pattern. Meredith and Morse said they have looked at updates of the data Birch studied and found that while African-American ex-felons still overwhelmingly identify as Democratic, non-African-Americans were only slightly more likely to identify as a Democrat than as a Republican. • Correlation is not necessarily causation. As we indicated above, it could be that high Democratic registration rates are inevitable results of a criminal justice system stacked against African-Americans. It's even possible that inmates’ experience in prison could ""turn"" an ex-felon Democratic. Perhaps ex-felons simply don’t like what they see as the Republican approach to criminal-justice policy. The bottom line is, despite Cruz’s belief that this is a ""simple and undeniable fact,"" there are enough asterisks with this statement to make it anything but. Our ruling Cruz said, ""Here’s the simple and undeniable fact: The overwhelming majority of violent criminals are Democrats."" Research cited by the Cruz campaign supports the claim that, in at least three states, felons released from prison go on to register as Democrats at a disproportionately high rate following their release. However, there are important caveats. The study in question looked at both violent and nonviolent felons without separating out those two groups. It’s not clear whether the patterns holds in the other 47 states. Also, the study didn’t look at active ""criminals"" but rather those who had already served their time. Finally, it’s hard to draw a line between cause and effect, particularly given the disproportionately high population of African-Americans -- a traditionally Democratic group -- in the criminal justice system. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976F6180>],/factchecks/2015/dec/01/ted-cruz/are-overwhelming-majority-violent-criminals-democr/
"['National', 'Terrorism', 'Ben Carson']","
Ben Carson incorrect that a government agency considers Family Research Council a terrorist group
","Over the long Thanksgiving weekend, the top news story was the incident in which a gunman killed three people and shot nine others at a Planned Parenthood clinic in Colorado Springs, Colo. During a Nov. 29 interview, CNN host Brianna Keilar asked Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson about the incident. ""Planned Parenthood is calling this now an act of domestic terrorism,"" Keilar said. ""Do you agree with that assessment?"" Responding by satellite link from Jordan, where he had gone to visit Syrian refugee camps, Carson said, ""It certainly is an act of extreme hatred and violence. You know, the Family Research Council, according to some government agencies, is a terrorist group. You know, so let's get away from the rhetoric and talk about the real problem."" A reader asked us to check whether it’s true that government agencies had labeled the Family Research Council a terrorist group. So we took a closer look. The council would seem like an odd group to be labeled ""terrorist."" A prominent think tank for social conservatives, the council hardly lives in the shadows. Its experts appear regularly on television, it has a prominent headquarters building in downtown Washington, and its legislative affiliate sponsors a high-profile annual political conference called the Value Voters Summit that attracts a variety of top politicians, including such Republican presidential contenders as … Ben Carson. We didn’t find that any government agencies have labeled the council as a terrorist group. But the council has sparked condemnation from a high-profile civil rights group, and it seems possible that might be what Carson was thinking of. (Neither Carson’s staff nor the Family Research Council responded to inquiries for this story.) The Southern Poverty Law Center -- a nonprofit based in Montgomery, Ala., that monitors ""domestic hate groups and other extremists, including the Ku Klux Klan, the neo-Nazi movement, neo-Confederates, racist skinheads, black separatists, anti-government militias, Christian Identity adherents and others"" -- has labeled the Family Research Council an ""extremist group."" Specifically, the Southern Poverty Law Center writes on its website that the Family Research Council’s ""specialty is defaming gays and lesbians. The FRC often makes false claims about the LGBT community based on discredited research and junk science. The intention is to denigrate LGBT people"" in various public-policy battles. The center separately lists several of the Family Research Council’s leaders, including president Tony Perkins and retired Lt. Gen William G. (Jerry) Boykin, the group’s executive vice president, in its category for individual ""extremists."" Such designations have flummoxed some observers, including some who generally lean liberal, such as Washington Post columnist Dana Milbank, who wrote, ""I disagree with the Family Research Council's views on gays and lesbians. But it's absurd to put the group, as the law center does, in the same category as Aryan Nations, Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Stormfront and the Westboro Baptist Church."" The Southern Poverty Law Center’s designation appears to have contributed to a violent incident when 28-year-old Floyd Corkins shot and wounded a security guard at the Family Research Council’s headquarters in August 2012. The gunman told law enforcement that he was opposed to the council’s socially conservative policies and had targeted the group after using the Southern Poverty Law Center’s website. Corkins later pleaded guilty to transporting a firearm over state lines, assault with intent to kill, and committing an act of terrorism while armed. We won’t take a position on the Southern Poverty Law Center’s designation, but we should note that while calling the Family Research Council an ""extremist"" group is a serious charge, it’s not the same thing as saying the council is a ""terrorist"" group. The former generally refers to someone who holds extreme views. The latter generally involves something more -- the threat or use of violence to advance such extreme views. For the record, the Southern Poverty Law Center does not consider the Family Research Council a ""terrorist"" group, said Heidi Beirich, a spokeswoman for the group. ""We have no such list,"" she said. That said, there has been some blurring of the lines, at least linguistically. "" 'Terrorism' and 'violent extremism' are often used interchangeably -- the Obama administration's policy on countering 'violent extremism' was explicitly intended to replace the term ‘terrorism,' "" said Charles Kurzman, a professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill who has studied terrorism. More definitively for the purpose of gauging Carson’s statement, the Southern Poverty Law Center is not a government agency. So are there any federal agency lists that label the Family Research Council a terrorist group? The only official, public list of terrorist groups is maintained by the State Department, and the Family Research Council isn’t on it. That list is designed to catalogue foreign terrorist organizations. Indeed, there is no equivalent list for domestic terrorist groups, though the FBI has cited some broad categories that it considers potential sources of domestic terrorism, including eco-terrorists and animal rights extremists, sovereign citizens movements, anarchist extremism, militia extremism and white supremacy extremism. The Family Research Council is not mentioned by name in any of these categories. Meanwhile, the Department of Homeland Security produced a report in April 2009 titled ""Rightwing Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment."" When the report was leaked to the public, the newly installed Obama administration took significant heat from some conservatives who said the report unfairly labeled right-of-center groups as potential sources of violence. However, neither this report -- nor another Department of Homeland Security study focusing on a broader range of potential ideologically driven threats -- lists the Family Research Council, or, for that matter, any other specific conservative groups. ""I do not know of any source that lists the Family Research Council as a ‘terrorist group,’ "" said Pete Simi, an associate professor of criminology and criminal justice at the University of Nebraska at Omaha, where he serves as director of radicalization and violent groups research. Our ruling Carson said, ""the Family Research Council, according to some government agencies, is a terrorist group."" The Family Research Council has been labeled an ""extremist"" group by the Southern Poverty Law Center, but that’s not the same as a ""terrorist"" group and, more importantly, the center is a private, non-profit group, not a government agency. We could find no government agency that singled out the Family Research Council as a terrorist group, and experts told us they were unaware of any government lists that did. We rate Carson’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3CA840>],/factchecks/2015/dec/01/ben-carson/ben-carson-incorrect-government-agency-considers-f/
