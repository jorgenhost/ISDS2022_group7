Does Mimi Walters support Trump 99 percent of the time?
","Democrats hoping to regain control of the U.S. House this November are trying to tie President Donald Trump and his policies around the necks of vulnerable congressional Republicans. That’s particularly true in California’s 45th Congressional District in Orange County, where Republican Rep. Mimi Walters is attempting to hold onto a seat in a district that backed Hillary Clinton in 2016. House Majority PAC, a group aligned with Democrats, puts Trump and Walters side by side a new TV ad. With Trump and Walters brand beer bottles in the background, and someone singing ""99 Bottles of Beer,"" the House Majority PAC ad claims Walters votes with the president ""99 percent of the time."" The ad also says Walters ""took big bucks from insurance interests"" and that she voted for Trump’s plan to ""strip protections for people with pre-existing conditions, and slap an age tax on older Californians."" We addressed those claims in a separate fact-check. Here, we focus in on whether Walters’ votes put her in lock-step with Trump in a district that supported Clinton two years ago. House Majority PAC says Walters votes with Trump ""99 percent of the time."" That figure tracks back to an analysis by the website FiveThirtyEight. FiveThirtyEight tracked 93 key congressional votes since Trump took office to see whether members of Congress support or oppose the president’s agenda. According to FiveThirtyEight, Walters voted on Trump’s side in all but two instances. In one case, Walters missed a vote to rescind previously approved but as of yet unspent federal funding. Trump supported rescinding those federal dollars. In a second case, in July 2017, Walters voted to approve additional sanctions on Russia, Iran and North Korea that Trump had opposed. When you factor out the missed vote, according to FiveThirtyEight, Walters agreed with Trump in 91 of 92 instances, or 98.9 percent of the time. Five Congressional Republicans lined up a perfect 100 percent of the time with Trump, while Rep. Walter Jones, R-N.C., only voted in line with Trump 49 percent of the time. We decided to check Congressional Quarterly as well, which also tracks how members of Congress voted when the president took a clear position. That includes statements of administration policy provided in advance of the vote, as well as his messages to Congress, news conference remarks and other public statements and documents. According to CQ (subscription required), Walters supported the president in 100 percent of the time in 2017. So, when it comes to votes, Walters has been almost always on the side of Trump. One caveat: As we have said in the past, you can debate the value of these types of comparisons, as they may overlook instances where an elected official bucked the leader of his or her party. Walters did not respond to a request for comment. The House Majority PAC says that Walters votes in line with Trump 99 percent of the time. It is true that Walters has supported Trump’s agenda in almost every case. FiveThirtyEight looked at 93 votes and found Walters on the side of the president 99 percent of the time. CQ said Walters agreed with Trump 100 percent of the time in 2017 in the votes they studied. The caveat in claims like these is that you can debate the usefulness of the statistic itself. With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/oct/16/house-majority-pac/does-mimi-walters-support-trump-99-percent-time/

Can Congress force Donald Trump to investigate missing Saudi journalist?
","A group of senators is pressuring President Donald Trump to respond more aggressively to Saudi Arabia’s suspected disappearance and murder of Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi nearly two weeks ago at the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul. The lawmakers have invoked a novel legal mechanism from the Global Magnitsky Act to try to compel the Trump administration to investigate the fate of Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident who had been living in the United States. The bipartisan slate of 22 senators penned a letter requesting that Trump order an investigation and report back its findings within 120 days. ""The Magnitsky letter,"" Mitchell said, ""is a way of saying to the president, ‘You are now under an affirmative requirement, legal requirement, to investigate this,’ which the administration did not want to do, investigate it with a time limit."" Mitchell, who is NBC News’ chief foreign affairs correspondent, was explaining the issue on the Oct. 14 broadcast of Meet the Press. We were curious if she was right, so we decided to fact-check her. Mitchell is correct that lawmakers are attempting to use the 2016 Global Magnitsky Act to signal that Trump is obligated to look into Khashoggi’s disappearance, and it’s the first time lawmakers have invoked that provision. Here, we’ll explore how the law works, as well as some of its possible limits. The ""Magnitsky letter"" that Mitchell referred to arrived at the White House Oct. 10, about a week after Khashoggi’s disappearance. The letter was a request from Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Bob Menendez, D-N.J., who are, respectively, the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. They were joined by 20 other senators, including Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the chairman and ranking member of the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee. ""The recent disappearance of Saudi journalist and Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi suggests that he could be a victim of a gross violation of internationally recognized human rights,"" the senators wrote. ""Therefore, we request that you make a determination on the imposition of sanctions pursuant to the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act with respect to any foreign person responsible for such a violation related to Mr. Khashoggi."" Sergei Magnitsky was a Russian accountant who was tortured and died in 2009 in a Moscow jail after exposing Russian corruption, according to Human Rights Watch. In 2012, Congress passed a law bearing his name that sanctioned high-ranking Russian officials who were believed to have committed serious human rights violations. A second law — known as the Global Magnitsky Act — cleared Congress in December 2016. It extended the first law’s accountability mission beyond Russia’s borders by authorizing the executive branch to impose visa bans and other sanctions on human rights violators anywhere in the world. Congress also has a role to play. The process begins with the chairman and ranking member of an appropriate congressional committee sending the president a written request. They can ask the president to investigate if a human rights violation — like extrajudicial killing or torture — has been committed. The target of abuse must be someone who was either working to expose illegal activity of government officials, or was engaged in some other kind of protected activity, like free expression, as in the case of a dissident journalist.   Under the law, the president has up to 120 days, from the time of the request, to determine if a human rights violation occurred. The law also states ""the president shall submit a classified or unclassified report"" to the committee’s top members. That report should say whether the president will impose sanctions, and what they entail. According to some experts, despite the law’s clear language, the president may not have to comply with the request, after all. A statement President Barack Obama made in 2016 when he signed the Global Magnitsky Act into law made clear that he believed this provision violated the separation of congressional and presidential power. ""(The provision) purports to require me to determine whether a foreign person has committed a sanctionable human rights violation when I receive a request to do so from certain members of Congress,"" Obama wrote in a signing statement. ""Consistent with the constitutional separation of powers, which limit the Congress's ability to dictate how the executive branch executes the law, I will maintain my discretion to decline to act on such requests when appropriate."" Rob Berschinski, a senior vice president at the advocacy group Human Rights First and a former official in Obama’s State Department, said Trump could use Obama’s signing statement as an out. ""Theoretically, the Trump administration could point to that signing statement and say this is an infringement on executive branch prerogative,"" Berschinski said. ""At the end of the day, the Magnitsky Act is an executive authority that was passed into law. But it’s purely elective."" Ultimately, it would be up to the courts to decide whether the provision authorizing Congress to request the White House to conduct human rights investigations is constitutional or not. Even if the courts were to strike down the provision, Congress would not be powerless, though. It could legislate sanctions, or take actions related to U.S. arms sales to Saudi Arabia. Still, Berschinski said the senators’ message in their letter to Trump was unmistakable. ""It was a very strong signal of congressional intent,"" he said. Mitchell said a letter to Trump from 22 senators ""is a way of saying to the president, ‘You are now under an affirmative requirement, legal requirement, to investigate’ "" Khashoggi’s suspected murder. Mitchell is correct that the Global Magnitsky Act contains a provision that allows certain members of congress to ask the president to carry out investigations of suspected human rights violations. Experts agreed the letter sent to the White House by 22 senators was a clear signal of congressional intent to oblige Trump to look into the circumstances surrounding Khashoggi’s disappearance. That said, Obama said upon signing the law in 2016 that he believes the provision violates the separation of powers — and at least some legal experts agree. We rate this Mostly True.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Washington State Democratic Party']","
Did Washington state's Dino Rossi really want new homes for unwed mothers?
","Say something odd, controversial or outlandish in politics and people will repeat it. Take this recent tweet from the Washington State Democratic Party: ""When he was in elected office, Dino Rossi consistently showed disrespect and disregard for women. From suggesting the state build ‘homes for unwed mothers’ that sound out of 'The Handmaid’s Tale' … ."" What? That was just one tweet in a thread of many, but it jumped out. Did Rossi, the Republican running for an open congressional seat in a district that extends east from Seattle’s suburbs, really suggest bringing back such a system? The question gains currency when considering that unmarried women account for about 40 percent of all births nationally today, and 32 percent in the state of Washington, according to the federal government’s National Center for Health Statistics. We sought out the quote in its full context to find out, and here’s what we learned. Rossi, a former state senator, made the statement sometime in the 1990s, apparently during an early political run. He was asked to give his views on abortion and said, according to video available on YouTube: ""I believe in the sanctity of innocent human life. That’s one of the reasons I voted against Initiative 120."" This was a state voter initiative, passed in 1991, that put into Washington state law the right to abortion. Backers said they wanted the initiative in case the U.S. Supreme Court’s Roe vs. Wade decision was ever overturned and states had to decide on the right. ""Back 90, 100 years ago, we had options and alternatives,"" he said. ""We had homes for unwed mothers. We had various different avenues, not just saying ‘no’ but giving alternatives. And I see that as the Right to Life movement moving towards that direction, which I think is healthy."" What does that have to do with ""The Handmaid’s Tale,"" which the Washington state Democrats mentioned? ""The Handmaid’s Tale"" is a novel and TV series about women, sexual servitude and forced adoption in a dystopian society. The title of the book by Margaret Atwood has become shorthand for a society that bans abortion and forces fertile women into childbirth. Homes for unwed mothers housed unmarried pregnant women in an era marked by scorn toward such pregnancies and stigma toward single parenthood. The homes had ties to adoption organizations, and when the mothers returned to their real homes, it was often to a hush-hush, childless life. In the years between 1945 and 1973, 1.5 million babies were ""surrendered"" in homes like this, said Ann Fessler, author of the book ""The Girls Who Went Away,"" a history of the women who surrendered children for adoption in the decades before the Roe vs. Wade decision. ""The social pressures of that time left women, especially middle class women, with very few options -- for most, no other option,"" she told us in an email. ""To make a choice, you need options."" Homes for unwed mothers largely disappeared in the 1970s, but a different kind of maternity group home gained popularity a few decades later and still exists. This model says it offers support, not coercion. Heartbeat International, a network of pro-life pregnancy support organizations, has about 100 homes across the country, and there are about 400 maternity homes nationwide counting all sponsor groups, said Andrea Trudden, spokeswoman for Heartbeat International. Some women come to the homes because they lack support from families, have abusive situations, are homeless or just need other help, but women come for a variety of other reasons, too, she said. How many women at today’s homes give up their babies for adoption? There do not appear to be solid statistics, and the modern homes -- many with direct links to the anti-abortion movement and ties with adoption agencies -- have skeptics as well. But we asked Mary Peterson, facilitator at the National Maternity Housing Coalition, which helps coordinate and train staff under Heartbeat’s umbrella. She said she’d guess only about 10 percent. ""Most of the women are choosing to parent now,"" she said. Rossi, who has run for governor twice and U.S. Senate once, did not say he wanted to bring back the old-style homes. He did not say he didn’t, either, at least on the video in the public realm. But the video cuts off after his controversial comment and doesn’t appear to include the entire conversation. What exactly did Rossi mean, then? Did he really think it would ""be healthy,"" as he said, to move back in the direction of the homes that existed 90 and 100 years ago, the homes that he specifically mentioned? His critics in Washington state have said so repeatedly. Sometimes the statement comes back to mock him, such as at a 2008 political event when Peggy Platt, a now-deceased Seattle comedian, said Rossi supported choice -- but only two: ""abstinence, or a home for unwed mothers."" A Nexis search of news articles shows no further explanation, with a campaign spokeswoman in his 2004 gubernatorial race telling a reporter that voters had more important issues to consider since ""the governor doesn’t have a lot to do with this issue."" Katie Rodihan, spokeswoman for his current political opponent, Democrat Kim Schrier, said in an email that Rossi ""actively tries to avoid talking about social issues -- we must rely on the statements he has given in the past, such as the one in that video."" So we asked Rossi’s campaign, and this is what spokesman Andrew Bell said in an email: ""Dino hasn’t suggested that the state build anything of the sort. 20+ years ago he discussed historical examples without advocating that we go back to them—the point was providing pregnant women the option and ability of choosing alternatives to abortion. This is just a decades old, out of context attack."" He added, ""Dino has never advocated for the state to build homes for unwed mothers, and the short edited clip that I’ve seen clearly is in the context of providing choices to mothers, not forcing anyone into a home."" The Washington State Democratic Party said in a tweet that Rossi suggested the state build ""homes for unwed mothers, which sounds right out of ""The Handmaid’s Tale."" It is true that Rossi wants to ban abortion except in cases of incest or rape or where the mother's life is at risk. But he did not actually suggest the state build homes for unwed mothers. He sympathetically spoke of them as an example of options from years ago, and said, ""I see that as the Right to Life movement moving towards that direction, which I think is healthy."" While Rossi’s critics speculate he means the direction of ""The Handmaid’s Tale,"" his campaign says they have taken his comment out of context. The tweet had an element of truth but, just like Rossi’s statement, requires a lot of context to understand. Those are the very conditions under which we rule a claim Half True.",/factchecks/2018/oct/16/washington-state-democratic-party/did-washington-states-dino-rossi-really-want-new-h/

Is Florida's economy propped up by low-wage jobs? Gillum says yes
","Florida has experienced job growth during Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s two terms, but the Democratic candidate looking to replace him questions the quality of those new positions. In an interview on CBS Miami’s ""Facing South Florida,"" host Jim DeFede asked Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum what he thought of Florida’s economy. ""I give him credit for an economy that is largely propped up on low-wage work,"" Gillum said. ""Of course you've got a low unemployment rate when people have got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet."" In a companion fact-check, we rated Gillum’s claim that the low unemployment rate is due to people working multiple jobs Pants on Fire. Here, we look at Gillum’s first claim: that Florida’s economy is largely propped up on low-wage work. Florida does have a lot of low-wage workers. Moody's Analytics senior economist Kwame Donaldson said Florida has a slightly higher percentage of people working low-wage jobs compared with the rest of the country — 36 percent in Florida, and 33 percent nationwide. Florida is ranked 26th among all states for low-wage jobs, based on taking 279 private industries and separating them into thirds — low-wage, mid-wage, high-wage — according to their average wage at the national level. That's right in the middle of states. In 2016, one in five Floridians were paid $10 or less an hour, according to the 2017 State of Working Florida report from Florida International University’s Center for Labor Research and Studies. The report shows that Florida lags the national trend of rising median wages. The state’s 2016 median wage of $16.03 an hour was the lowest in 11 years. ""If Gillum’s point is that this situation has gotten worse under Gov. Scott, then there is evidence in support of this claim,"" Donaldson said. ""The share of low-wage jobs in Florida has grown by two percentage points over the last eight years, the 10th-sharpest increase in the nation."" In an email, Gillum’s campaign pointed to an article from the Gainesville Sun that highlighted the increase in low-wage jobs since the recession, indeed making that point. Low-wage jobs have accounted for nearly one in every two jobs created in Florida between 2005 and 2016, according to the 2017 State of Working Florida report. More than 392,000 of the 883,000 jobs created during this time paid $10 or less an hour. Gillum said that Florida’s economy was propped up on low-wage jobs. We found that some of Florida’s job growth has been in low-wage jobs, and that the median wage level is the lowest in 11 years. However, there has been job growth in higher-paying jobs as well, and Florida is ranked 26th in low-wage jobs compared to other states. Gillum has a point but additional context is needed.

Andrew Gillum's Pants on Fire claim on Florida's low unemployment rate
","Gov. Rick Scott has touted a strong Florida economy built up over his two terms in office. But Andrew Gillum, the Democratic candidate seeking to replace him, says the economy is ""propped up"" by low wages and people working multiple jobs just to make ends meet. In an interview on CBS Miami’s ""Facing South Florida,"" host Jim DeFede asked the Tallahassee mayor if he gave Scott any credit for the economy. ""I give him credit for an economy that is largely propped up on low-wage work,"" Gillum said. ""Of course you've got a low unemployment rate when people have got to work two and three jobs just to make ends meet."" In a companion fact-check, we looked Gillum’s claim about low-wage work propping up Florida’s economy (Half True). Here, we will examine Gillum’s latter point about the low unemployment rate is propped up by people with multiple jobs. After the interview, the campaign of Gillum’s Republican rival, Ron DeSantis, cried ""Pants on Fire!"" to Gillum’s multiple jobs claim. The campaign was referencing our fact-check of a similar statement by Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez about the national unemployment rate. Is Gillum’s claim any better? No. It is similarly wrong. Florida does have nearly full employment, with an unemployment rate of 3.7 percent as of August 2018. Gillum doesn’t see that as positively as Scott. But his point that low unemployment indicates that people are working multiple low-wage jobs to make ends meet doesn’t hold up. Official unemployment rates are not affected by the number of jobs people hold. Nationally, only a small percentage of American workers are employed at more than one job, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The number has hovered in the 4.7 to 5.2 percent range during the past 10 years. Florida’s percentage of residents with more than one job does not deviate from national trends. The number of jobs in Florida has risen 2.8 percentage points faster than the number of workers in Florida over the past eight years, based on data from the federal Household and Payroll surveys. Moody's Analytics senior economist Kwame Donaldson said that’s evidence some workers have more than one job. However, he said, Florida is ranked 26th in the United States in this measure. Nationally, the number of jobs rose 2.9 percentage points faster than the number of workers in that time period. Data about multiple job holders isn’t specific enough to draw conclusions about the quality of the jobs, according to Sean Snaith, the director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness. ""You can have multiple jobs even if your primary job is high-paying,"" Snaith said. Over the past year, the number of American workers who’ve held multiple jobs has ranged between 6 million and 7 million, compared to more than 148 million who are employed in a single job. The number of jobs people hold does not affect the BLS unemployment rate. People are counted as employed as long as they hold one job. They do not get counted again if they hold more than one. ""The claim about multiple jobs and unemployment is simply not true,"" Snaith said. Gillum said that unemployment was low because people were working multiple jobs. Unemployment rates are not influenced by how many jobs someone holds, and not many people hold more than one job. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2018/oct/15/andrew-gillum/andrew-gillum-unemployment-claim/

Collins tries to use McMurray's work in Asia against him
","Rep. Chris Collins, running for re-election to Congress in New York's 27th District in Western New York, is rolling out attack ads criticizing challenger Nathan McMurray's work in Asia. One side of a Collins mailer states: ""Nate McMurray lobbied to send our jobs to China. (And Korea too.) The other side states: ""Nate McMurray: American job exporter. Nate McMurray spent many years in Asia working to identify cheap labor and offshoring opportunities for American companies. He lobbied for trade deals that outsourced thousands of U.S. jobs to China and Korea - doubling our trade deficit and devastating American businesses."" We decided to fact-check the Republican's claim that McMurray, a Democrat, ""lobbied to send our jobs to China. (And Korea, too.)"" The citations The mailer, paid for by the Collins campaign, lists three sources for the claims it makes, though it does not have a source for the claim we focus on here. The first source, a Buffalo News story, mentions McMurray’s time working abroad, but it does not say he was ""working to identify cheap labor and offshoring opportunities for American companies,"" as the mailer states. The News story mentions McMurray’s time in Asia, studying law in Seoul, South Korea, on a Fulbright scholarship, and working as legal counsel for Samsung. To bolster Collins’ claim that McMurray ""lobbied for trade deals that outsourced thousands of U.S. jobs to China and Korea,"" Collins cites a journal article published by the American Chamber of Commerce in Korea, co-written by McMurray. The article is about how foreign companies can navigate Korea’s ""restrictive employment agreements."" There is no reference to any lobbying efforts in favor of trade deals by McMurray. The mailer’s final citation, from the New York Times, purportedly bolsters the mailer’s claim that the trade deals that McMurray ""lobbied for"" doubled the trade deficit and devastated American businesses. The story about the start of renegotiations of a trade pact between the United States and Korea includes a quote from Robert Lighthizer, the U.S. trade representative. He said the trade deficit in goods between the United States and Korea doubled since the United States Korea Free Trade Agreement took effect in 2012. The pact did not yield the expected increase in exports of American goods, and U.S. goods exports actually went down, Lighthizer said. Work in Asia But did McMurray lobby to send jobs to China and Korea? The lawyer who recruited McMurray to work for a Korean law firm called the claim ""utter nonsense."" Thomas Pinansky, the senior foreign attorney and partner at Barun Law in Seoul, South Korea, recruited McMurray to the firm and supervised his work. McMurray helped American companies enter the Korean market, Pinansky said in an interview. ""The comments are utter nonsense, they’re not based factually on what Nathan was doing as an international attorney on the ground in Korea,"" said Pinansky, a self-described independent voter who donated $300 to McMurray’s campaign. The law firm works with American companies and others ""to help them succeed in historically a difficult market to penetrate, but it’s an important one,"" Pinansky said. The claim that McMurray ""lobbied"" to send American jobs to Asia is false, he said. ""Lobbying is also absurd. It makes no sense at all,"" Pinansky said. ""Lobbying whom for what?"" McMurray worked as a legal adviser in Asia from 2006 to 2013, first in China with Allen & Overy, and then in Korea with Barun Law and Samsung, according to his campaign manager, Victoria Dillon. ""In none of these positions did he have the authority to outsource any jobs,"" Dillon said. Labor support We attempted to get evidence for this claim from the Collins campaign. Four attempts to contact the campaign, through telephone and email messages, left over two days, were not returned. McMurray’s work in Asia has been a point of attack for Collins in a recent television ad. An automated phone call also mentioned McMurray’s supposed ties to trade deals that increased the U.S. trade deficit. The identity of the person or group who paid for the automated call is not clear.   In a statement responding to the Collins television ad that had a similar attack, McMurray pointed to endorsements from the labor community. They include United Steel Workers and United Automobile, Aerospace, and Agricultural Workers of America.    ""Do you think I’d have the support of the local and national labor community if I was going to ship jobs to Asia? Of course not,"" McMurray said. Our ruling McMurray worked in Asia with American companies trying to enter markets there. He also was a co-author of an article about navigating Korea's labor laws. Collins claimed ""McMurray lobbied to send our jobs"" to China and Korea. There is no evidence that companies sought McMurray’s legal advice to move jobs from the United States to Asia, or that McMurray lobbied on behalf of trade deals.

Kanye West jumps the gun in saying there are 4,000 Foxconn jobs in Wisconsin paying $53,000
","Not to be outdone by pop singer Taylor Swift, rapper-producer Kanye West weighed in on politics — from the Oval Office, no less  — and made a statement about Wisconsin that we want to check. Swift made her first foray into politics with an Instagram post in which she made a claim about a federal domestic violence law and a Republican U.S. Senate candidate from Tennessee, her home state. She earned a Mostly True from PolitiFact National. West, who’s from Chicago, has spoken out before about politics, including going on a rant during one of his concerts in 2016. But as one of the highest-profile celebrity supporters of President Donald Trump, West drew more attention on Oct. 11, 2018, four days after Swift’s post. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. West pontificated during what USA Today called a ""meandering 10-minute monologue while making remarks with Trump and Trump’s son-in-law, White House adviser Jared Kushner. He made his claim about Wisconsin during this exchange, according to the White House transcript: West: And what we need is, we can empower the pharmaceuticals and make more money.  That’s one thing — I’ve never stepped into a situation where I didn’t make people more money.  So we can empower pharmaceuticals, we can empower our industries, we can empower our factories.  We can bring not only Adidas onshore, we can bring — Foxconn has set up a factory in, I think, Minnesota.

Kushner: Wisconsin.

West: Fifty-three thousand —

Trump: Wisconsin. Yeah.Wisconsin.

West: Yeah. Wisconsin. They have 4,000 jobs. People making $53,000 a year. So, does Foxconn have 4,000 jobs in Wisconsin with people making $53,000 a year? Not yet. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. West’s reference is to a massive deal that Foxconn, a Taiwanese company, forged with GOP Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. Walker has praised the deal as a mega-job creator. Critics, including Democrat Tony Evers, who faces Walker in the Nov. 6, 2018 election, say Wisconsin is spending too much on the deal. Foxconn plans to invest as much as $10 billion on a high-tech electronics factory in Racine County, in southeast Wisconsin, and to employ up to 13,000 people. In exchange, Wisconsin has agreed to give the company up to $2.85 billion in cash payments and $150 million in tax breaks. The full $2.85 billion would be paid only if the company invests at least $9 billion in its plant and, in rough numbers, employs at least 13,000 people earning at least $30,000 per year. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. We didn’t hear back from a spokesman for West about the claim. But here’s what we know about what West said: No jobs yet: Foxconn has broken ground on the factory. But no one is producing ultra-high-definition flat screens yet. Thousands expected: Foxconn has said it plans to initially employ 3,000 people  — and eventually 13,000 — at the plant. So, West’s figure of 4,000 jobs is in that range. Wages: Foxconn’s contract with the state says the average annual salary will be $53,875, plus benefits. So, West’s claim of $53,000 is on target. Critics of the Foxconn deal have questioned whether the average would reach that level only by Foxconn paying huge salaries to executives, and then paying wages well below the $53,875 to a large portion of employees. Under the state’s contract with Foxconn, wages paid up to $400,000 annually will be counted as part of the average. West says in Wisconsin, Foxconn has ""4,000 jobs, people making $53,000 a year."" The Taiwanese company has broken ground on a massive electronics factory that it says will initially employ 3,000 people, and eventually 13,000, at an average wage of nearly $54,000 per year. But both figures are plans, albeit connected to a contract Foxconn has signed with the State of Wisconsin. There aren’t any jobs, and therefore no average wages in that range, yet. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.

""Andrew Gillum has ties to an active criminal investigation. Gillum took possible illegal trips with lobbyists to New York and Costa Rica. More controversy concerning Tallahassee mayor Andrew Gillum. Gillum approved millions in grants for those same lobbyists. An ongoing corruption probe. Now Gillum refuses to disclose who has paid him."" It appears unlikely that law enforcement will announce the results of their investigation before Gillum faces Republican Ron DeSantis in the race for governor. So some of the ad’s claims are speculative. In a related story, we will explain all of the ad’s allegations in depth. Here, we will fact-check the ad’s most inaccurate statement, that Gillum is running from, or somehow evading, the FBI. The ad is wrong when it states that Gillum is running from the FBI. None of the news articles cited by the Republicans provide evidence that Gillum has run from the FBI. The only evidence publicly known is that Gillum has cooperated with an ongoing corruption investigation in Tallahassee. The investigation started in 2015, when FBI agents posed as businessmen identifying themselves as Mike Sweets, Mike Miller and Brian Butler. They spent months schmoozing Tallahassee city officials and those around them. The undercover agents said they wanted to invest in properties if they could get public funding. In June 2017, FBI agents delivered a subpoena to Tallahassee City Hall requesting thousands of pages of records from key players in city government. The records related to top local developers behind projects subsidized by the city’s Community Redevelopment Agency. The FBI issued more subpoenas through May 2018, and the city has turned over about 200,000 records. The Tallahassee Democrat broke the story about the FBI investigation on June 22, 2017. The next day, Gillum said he had already met with the FBI, and that the FBI told him he was not the focus of the investigation. ""Last week, the FBI approached me about several people and businesses here in Tallahassee,"" Gillum said in a statement. ""I spoke with them and told them they could expect both the city and my personal cooperation with the investigation. They assured me I was not the focus of an investigation and that they would be moving quickly with their work."" Gillum met with the FBI without a lawyer present, he says. Barry Richard, Gillum’s attorney for a related state ethics commission complaint, told PolitiFact that the FBI has not asked for any subsequent meeting with Gillum or any documents from him. ""There is no FBI probe of Gillum,"" Richard said. ""The only connection is the FBI asked him some questions in his home and told him he wasn’t the focus."" Steven R. Andrews, a Tallahassee attorney representing the city’s former manager — who testified before the federal grand jury — told Politico he believes Gillum is in the clear. Prosecutors never asked his client about the mayor, Andrews said. Law enforcement hasn’t commented to the media about the investigation. A Republican Party of Florida ad said Gillum is running ""from the FBI."" The claim tracks back to a corruption investigation involving Tallahassee, where Gillum is mayor. But there's no evidence to suggest that Gillum is running from the FBI.  After news of the FBI investigation became public in June 2017, Gillum said he met with the FBI the previous week. Gillum met with the FBI at his home without a lawyer, he says. His lawyer in a related ethics matter said that the FBI has not asked for a subsequent meeting with Gillum. We don’t know the full story behind the FBI investigation yet, because law enforcement have made no announcements about the case. But there is no evidence that Gillum has run from the FBI.

Do Trump tariffs cost more than Affordable Care Act taxes?
","In an op-ed for the Washington Examiner, analysts at the National Taxpayers Union wrote that President Donald Trump’s tariffs would cost American taxpayers more than the Affordable Care Act. The pro-free trade group estimated the annual cost of Trump’s enacted tariffs at $41.65 billion. (The research was conducted by the National Taxpayers Union Foundation, the nonprofit arm of the National Taxpayers Union advocacy group.) ""That easily outpaces the tax bill from the Affordable Care Act for next year ($34.6 billion) after accounting for recent changes to the ACA,"" they wrote. Are the tariffs costing Americans more than the health care law, or ACA? They are focused on the new taxes that were specifically created in the Affordable Care Act. But Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told us there are hundreds of billions of dollars of general tax revenues that pay for Obamacare. So while the National Taxpayers Union is mainly correct in terms of the new taxes, it doesn’t quite capture all of the tax money that funds health care. The group used Congressional Budget Office July 2017 estimates of what repealing taxes connected with the health care law would cost in lost revenue. That was $49.2 billion. The repeal was unsuccessful, so taxpayers would have continued paying that sum. But two of those taxes were suspended for 2019: the tax on medical devices and insurers. That led to a reduction of $14.6 billion, landing the estimate of 2019 ACA taxes at $34.6 billion.  However, the National Taxpayers Union’s estimate excludes the unpopular individual mandate, which imposed a penalty on people without insurance, as well as the employer mandate. The individual mandate is not being enforced, so that exclusion makes no difference. However, employer mandate penalties would add as much as $8 billion to the total in 2019, according to Congressional Budget Office estimates. That would bring the total of ACA-imposed taxes somewhere around $42 billion, which exceeds the estimated cost of the tariffs. The National Taxpayers Union’s rhetorical point is that tariffs are simply taxes on imports; businesses in the United States pay taxes on the imported goods, not China. For the tariffs, the National Taxpayers Union multiplied the percentage of each tariff by the amount of those goods imported last year. So the cost of a 25 percent steel tariff, for example, was $7.3 billion because in 2017, the U.S. imported just over $29 billion of steel. The American Tax Foundation used the same method and came to a similar estimate, $41.9 billion. That methodology assumes the same amount of goods will be imported as last year. But that’s by no means set in stone. ""The dollar cost of the tariffs will be higher than we estimated if imports increase,"" said Bryan Riley, director of NTU's Free Trade Initiative and op-ed co-author. ""However it's also possible that high tariffs could reduce import volume, which could offset some of the projected tariff revenue increase."" Matt Gardner, a senior fellow at the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, added that regardless of imports volume, we don’t know how they will get passed through by the companies paying them, either. And not everyone has to pay them -- consumers could simply redirect their demand. ""Will it all get passed through in the form of higher prices on retail goods? Will the employees of these companies get lower wages? Likely some combination of these things, but nobody yet knows,"" Gardner said. The National Taxpayers Union said, ""The latest round of tariffs now means that the total tax increase on Americans from enacted tariffs exceeds the tax increases from the Affordable Care Act."" Their estimates were that the annual cost of Trump’s enacted tariffs would be $41.65 billion in 2019, while taxes for the health care law would be $34.6 billion. Both of these are estimates. Estimates of tariff costs fall slightly below new taxes introduced by the ACA when you factor in mandate penalties. However, the costs of tariffs are yet unknown, and its effects indirect on American taxpayers. We rate this statement Half True. Update: This report was updated to specifically mention the role of the National Taxpayers Union Foundation.",/factchecks/2018/oct/12/national-taxpayers-union/trump-tariffs-cost-more-health-care-taxes/

No, 5-4 Supreme Court rulings are not on the rise
","Justice Brett Kavanaugh’s seating on the Supreme Court followed one of the most bitter and divisive confirmation fights in the High Court’s history. Some legal commentators suggested that, in addition to questions of Kavanaugh’s personal history and judicial temperament, the Supreme Court’s own internal dynamics helped intensify the fight over the vacant seat. ""One of the reasons I think we fight so hard is you look at the number of 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches. Those are going up,"" said Yale Law professor Stephen Carter. ""The more those decisions go up, the more valuable each seat is, each vacancy."" There may be a public perception that 5-4 decisions are up, perhaps owing to blockbuster rulings in recent years on everything from health care to voting rights to political spending that were decided by this slimmest of margins. It’s also possible that Kavanaugh could cast deciding votes on cases with major implications for American society. But the data shows that 5-4 decisions are not trending upward. We reached out to Carter, who said he’d misspoken. ""Mea culpa. I do know better,"" he said of his Oct. 10 appearance on MSNBC’s Morning Joe. ""When I talk about this subject to students and colleagues, I usually refer to the perception that there are lots of 5-4 decisions as the driver of perceived value of each vacancy."" To be sure, many high profile cases have been decided on a 5-4 basis in recent years. The most recent term also had a higher rate of 5-4 decisions than the previous two terms. However, there’s no discernible long-term upward trend, according to a SCOTUSBlog analysis of past 13 terms, as well as interviews with Supreme Court watchers:  ""I don’t think there’s a particular trend there,"" said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in Constitutional Studies at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""I don’t think it’s accurate to say that the rate of 5-4 decisions is increasing."" Not all cases the justices hear are equal, of course. Each year, some cases carry greater potential impact and public interest than others. Experts told us that when charting the relative frequency of 5-4 decisions over time, there’s no objective way to separate the (for lack of better term) major cases from minor cases. However, Sara Benesh, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin - Milwaukee, said blockbuster cases do tend to produce less consensus than minor ones. But that’s nothing new, she said. ""It is true that ‘big,’ controversial cases are more likely to be decided 5-4 than more ‘routine’ cases,"" she said. ""But that has been true over time as well."" Oftentimes those divisions break along familiar ideological lines. Justice Elena Kagan, an Obama appointee, addressed the Court’s voting breakdown in a recent speech. She said the Court’s relatively high frequency of 9-0 opinions is underappreciated, but acknowledged that big cases often do produce more disagreement. ""There are some issues — some important issues that people care about — in which the court is more closely divided and tends to be divided along lines that you might predict, if you look at who nominated each of us,"" she said.  I transcribed the entirety of Justice Elena Kagan's answer about the Supreme Court and institutional legitimacy because I think it's important. pic.twitter.com/BzEbXF5Z9T Overall, the rate of 9-0 decisions have outnumbered the rate of 5-4 decisions in recent years, according to Sarah Turberville of the government watchdog group Project on Government Oversight, who provided the following chart:  ""It’s not entirely accurate to say 5-4 decisions have increased,"" Turberville said. ""Yes, there was an increase from 2016 to 2017, but there was also an increase in 9-0 decisions over that course of time."" Carter said that the 5-4 decisions the Supreme Court reaches ""are going up."" The most recent Supreme Court term had a higher rate of 5-4 decisions than the previous two terms. However, the data since at least 2005 shows 5-4 decisions are not trending upward. Carter himself said he misspoke, and meant to say there was a perception that such cases were on the rise.

Evidence mixed on Scott Walker claim that rival Tony Evers will raise property, income and gas taxes
","When Scott Walker put out a TV ad reviving a skit from ""The Electric Company,"" a 1970s children’s television show that co-starred Morgan Freeman, Mashable snarkily called it ""one of the most bizarre campaign ads of 2018."" The ad aims to win the Republican governor a third term in the Nov. 6, 2018 election. It features silhouettes of a woman and a man facing each other. They take turns claiming that Walker’s Democratic challenger, state schools superintendent Tony Evers, would raise taxes. But there is a more conventional ad -- where Walker makes a similar, but more specific claim on Evers and taxes -- that we want to fact check. In that spot, released Sept. 20, 2018, Walker begins by saying: ""With all the attack ads, it’s easy to forget"" things in Wisconsin he likes to highlight, such as low unemployment and high-performing schools. Then Walker himself attacks, saying: ""Tony Evers? Well, he’ll raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon."" Walker has made claims like that in three more TV ads. What’s more, similar claims are made in a TV ad from the Republican Governors Association/Right Direction Wisconsin PAC and in a TV ad from Americans for Prosperity. So, what evidence does Walker have to back his political future-telling? It’s a mix: Evers is at least opening the door to higher property taxes; he said he will raise income taxes in at least one way; and he might raise the gas tax, but he says not by $1 per gallon. But it’s also important to note that, while Evers has said he is open to tax increases, it’s not clear that he would raise all the taxes Walker says. And when it comes to property and income taxes, Evers has not expressed support for across-the-board increases. All our Tony Evers and Scott Walker fact checks in the governor’s race. Evers wants to raise limits on how much local school districts can levy in property taxes  — in other words, giving school districts the ability to increase property taxes. He argues that because he also proposes increasing state aid to schools, among other factors, that will offset  — at least in the aggregate — the need for any property tax increase. On the property tax side: Current law allows no per-pupil increase in local property taxes. Evers’ 2019-’21 budget request for his Department of Public Instruction calls for allowing school districts to increase local property taxes by $200 per-pupil in the first year of the budget and by $204 the second year. On the state aid side: But Evers has also called for, as part of his budget proposal, increasing state payments to schools by $1.4 billion, or 10 percent, over two years. Evers has said he could increase the aid by making cuts elsewhere in the state budget. The upshot, according to the Department of Public Instruction, is school districts with higher property wealth could their see property taxes go up, while less-wealthy districts could see property taxes go down. But the department says there would be no net increase in property taxes collected. The department provided us figures indicating that increased state aid and other factors would offset any property taxes in total during the 2019-’21 budget period. A spokesman for the department told us Evers is committed after that, when revenue limits would rise with inflation, to continue to provide enough state aid to keep property taxes flat overall. In any case, lifting the revenue limits at least opens the door to property tax increases. All our Tammy Baldwin and Leah Vukmir fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. Before he secured the Democratic nomination, Evers said he wants to eliminate the manufacturing and agriculture tax credit, saying it favors the rich. His campaign has since repeated that Evers wants to eliminate the credit. Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, the state’s largest business lobby, supports the credit, saying it leads to business investment and job creation. The credit, part of Walker’s first state budget in 2011, gradually reduced the state tax on the production earnings of manufacturers and agricultural businesses to nearly nothing -- from 7.9 percent to 0.4 percent. (In 2017, we rated Mostly True a claim that 11 people who each make over $30 million got a total of $22 million in credits from the tax credit.) It’s also worth noting that Evers has said he is considering increasing income taxes on the wealthy and cutting income taxes for others — but adds: ""There’s no definite plans at this time."" So, by eliminating one tax credit, Evers would be increasing income taxes on manufacturers and agricultural businesses; and he is open to raising income taxes on the wealthy, but lowering them on others. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. On Aug. 15, 2018, the day after Evers won the primary election, Walker said Evers might be willing to quadruple the state’s 32.9 cents-per-gallon state gas tax because Evers hasn't said how much he would be willing to increase it. Later that morning, a reporter asked Evers about Waker’s comment and whether he would raise the gas tax by $1. Evers responded more generally by saying: ""I would support looking at anything, whether it’s removing tax credits, whether it’s slimming down state government, whether it’s gas taxes. Everything is on the table.""

But by the afternoon, Evers said Walker was lying about his views on the gas tax. ""The only thing I ever said about that,"" Evers declared, ""is that every possible revenue source is on the table."" Evers has not said how much of an increase in the gas tax he could back. Evers has also said, in speaking about road funding, that he would consider increasing the gas tax or implementing tolls. He said he ""has no range"" in terms of how high of an increase in the gas tax he would consider. Evers also has said that while he is considering increasing the gas tax to pay for roads, a $1 increase was ""ridiculous."" So, saying Evers will raise gas taxes by up to $1 per gallon, when he has only said he would consider raising the tax some amount, goes too far. Walker says Evers will ""raise property taxes, raise income taxes and raise gas taxes by as much as a dollar a gallon."" Evers has pledged to eliminate a Walker-era manufacturing and agriculture tax credit. So, that will result in higher income taxes for those who have taken advantage of the credit. On property taxes, Evers acknowledges that his proposed budget for the state Department of Instruction could result in higher property taxes in some school districts and lower levies in others. By lifting revenue limits, however, Evers would be allowing school districts to increase property taxes. And while Evers has said he is open to raising the gas tax, he hasn’t said he would seek any particular increase and has flatly denied that it would be $1. Moreover, while Evers is open to raising taxes, it's not across-the-board, at least in the case of property and income taxes.

"['Immigration', 'Oregon', 'Greg Walden']","
Does the U.S. admit more legal immigrants than the rest of the world combined?
","
You can’t really escape the immigration debate these days. Even with a bipartisan proposal, there are detractors on both sides. Add to the list: Lars Larson, Oregon’s very own conservative talk radio host.

Recently, Larson took his show on the road to Washington, D.C., to chat up politicians about the immigration reform debate and make it pretty clear he was having none of it. One of his guests, Oregon’s sole Republican Rep. Greg Walden, was more measured in his comments -- he hadn’t had a chance to read the just-released immigration proposal.

At the beginning of the interview, Walden pointed out that the United States was a country of immigrants, adding that’s even true today.

""I would say this, I believe, and somebody will correct me if I'm wrong because everything gets fact checked, which is good, I think we allow more people into America legally than all other countries on the planet combined,"" he said.

He basically invited PolitiFact Oregon to go after that one -- so we did.

We sent the representative’s office a note asking if they could provide us with a source for the claim. They did us one better and sent three sources. 
The primary source was a fact sheet from the U.S. State Department, which notes ""the United States accepts more legal immigrants as permanent residents than the rest of the world combined."" It didn’t offer any basis for the claim, but Walden’s office provided one.

In a separate piece written for The New York Times, Jan C. Ting, a law professor at Temple University, meditates on the downside of high immigration and uses a very similar statistic. Specifically, in his piece, he notes that ""If we count only those receiving comparable permanent residence and a clear path to full citizenship, the U.S. admits more legal immigrants than all the nations of the world combined."" 
We sent an email to see if he could expand on that. His reply:

""I'm comparing green cards to green cards, not H1-B temporary work permits or tourist visas, or illegal immigration. The first question to ask is how many countries in the world even issue green cards for permanent legal residence with a clear path to full citizenship? The answer is very few.  Most countries don't welcome immigrants at all.""

Comparable countries to the United States, he said, are Canada, Australia and New Zealand. We checked with the immigration figures provided by the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. Ting was right. Together, Canada, Australia and New Zealand recorded about 530,000 permanent immigrants in 2010, compared to 1 million recorded in the U.S.

But we were curious about the broader world beyond Ting’s definition, because people immigrate to other places, like to England, France, Germany. We understand that those countries don’t have a green card system similar to the United States, but they do allow immigrants to become permanent residents. So we set out to check on those systems.

We went back to the OECD and asked if the organization broke down figures between permanent and temporary immigrants. And they did. Here they are:

The United Kingdom recorded more than 414,000 permanent immigrants in 2010; this figure does not include temporary workers, international students or tourists. Also in 2010, about 241,000 people were granted ""settlement,"" which is akin to getting a green card in that a person has permission to reside indefinitely, and 190,000 immigrants were granted citizenship. India is the leading source of people moving to the United Kingdom.

Other countries record permanent immigrants -- Italy (330,000), Spain (300,000) and Germany (220,000) -- but they don’t break down their data in the same way the U.K. does. Basically, immigration statistics are complicated and it’s hardly an ideal, apples-to-apples situation.

One chart that OECD puts together, however, specifically addresses the idea of ""permanent immigrants."" The chart doesn’t catalog the entire world’s immigration figures, just specific OECD countries. That said, if you do some simple math, you find out that in 2010, the U.S. let in just over 1 million permanent immigrants. Altogether, the other 23 countries listed let in more than 3 million. That’s more than the U.S. even if you were to include things like HB-1 visas and other temporary residents.

To be clear, we’re not talking about countries like Qatar here, which let in a significant number of immigrants but give them few rights.

Of course, we wanted to make sure we were reading this chart right, so we sent an email to OECD policy analyst Jonathan Chaloff. He said our take on the information was accurate and offered some context:

""The million annual entries in the USA are green cards, which grant permanent residence. Similar permanent residence statistics are used for Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. Most other countries grant renewable temporary permits which eventually lead (usually after 3 to 8 years) to permanent residence. We classify such entries as ""permanent-type"" because in practice the long-term stay rates for recipients of these visas/permits are similar to those for ‘permanent’ immigrants to USA, Canada, etc.""

Chaloff pointed out something else: The U.S. receives fewer ""permanent-type"" immigrants per capita than most other OECD countries. For that fact, he offered us a table which shows, indeed, the U.S. is in 18th place in that measurement.

By all means the United States is a wonderful country, and PolitiFact Oregon is intimately associated with persons who have immigrated to the U.S. and become citizens. But we’re hardly alone.

Which brings us back to Walden’s statement. The representative said that ""we allow more people into America legally than all other countries on the planet combined."" That’s true only when specifically talking about a small group of countries that have a green-card-like immigration system that provides a path to citizenship.

We understand that this metric is in wide use -- by academics, opinion writers and, at one point, even the state department. We also appreciate that Walden was measured in his statement, saying ""I believe"" and ""I think."" He even invited fact checkers to look into the issue. But ultimately, none of that changes the fact that to focus on only four countries while making a statement about the entire world is misleading, even if it’s not on purpose.

When we compare permanent immigrants in other countries -- green-card and permanent-type residents --  we find that Walden’s statement is not accurate without significant context. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/24/greg-walden/does-us-really-admit-more-legal-immigrants-rest-wo/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Bill Ratliff']","
Bill Ratliff says Texas has one charter school rated ""unacceptable"" for seven years
","
In an interview with Texas Monthly magazine, Bill Ratliff aired support for whittling state-mandated tests faced by students, while also saying it makes sense for lawmakers to bear down on charter schools that have failed to fulfill academic expectations.

The lobbyist, a former Republican state senator who was elected by colleagues to be the state’s lieutenant governor from 2001 to 2003, noted that legislation then awaiting final action would permit additional charter schools and ""crack down on bad charter schools. We have one charter school that for seven years has been rated unacceptable. Well, why do we allow that to continue?""

We wondered if that seven-year statement holds up, ultimately finding that the troubled school was years out of business when Ratliff spoke.

Charter schools background 
At the least, Ratliff's statement seemed against the grain of our January 2013 finding that the state can shut down a regular poor-performing school in as little as three years. The story quoted a Texas Education Agency spokeswoman as saying the state can shut down charter schools even more quickly.

In multiple ways, though, charter schools--which receive public dollars but are run by private nonprofit entities--have enjoyed greater leeway under state law than traditional public schools, as noted in an April 11, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. ""Intended to be laboratories of innovation, they are freed from many state education laws, such as teacher contract rules,"" the story said. ""They now serve about 3 percent of Texas public school students on about 500 campuses.""

That story quoted state Sen. Dan Patrick, R-Houston, chairman of the Senate Education Committee, as estimating that about 10 percent of charter campuses had failed to meet expectations, and also saying the state had struggled to revoke their licenses. ""While there are some top-rate charter schools in the state, others are disproportionately among the lowest performing,"" the story said. In 2011, the story said, nearly 18 percent of ""charter schools were deemed ‘unacceptable’ while only 4.9 percent of traditional public schools were hit with that lowest rating.""

A state report 
By telephone, Ratliff told us he believes he spotted the seven-year example in information noted by his client, Raise Your Hand Texas, which describes itself as advocating greater investment in the schools. Shannon Ratliff, the elder Ratliff’s nephew and a spokesman for the group, pointed us to a report highlighting poor-performing charter school campuses as the likely basis for the other Ratliff’s claim.

The state’s Sunset Advisory Commission concluded in a January 2013 report listing legislative recommendations related to the education agency that charter schools account for 17 percent of school districts and schools, but 71 percent of the state's schools facing sanctions for failing to meet academic or financial standards.

And the report’s Appendix D notes that from as early as 1998 through 2011, the state had rated four charter campuses as academically unacceptable for six nonconsecutive years or more, including a campus that had drawn the rating in seven years.

Schools draw the ratings based on an array of indicators led by whether student performance improves from the year before on the state’s mandated tests--and those results are further broken out by the ethnicity of students and the share of students who come from economically disadvantaged households.

Identifying the school 
The published chart does not identify campuses by name. But education agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson emailed us a spreadsheet, drawing on agency records, indicating the Gabriel Tafolla Charter School in Uvalde was rated ""academically unacceptable"" or the equivalent in 2000 through 2002 and 2005 through 2008, a total of seven years. The school was rated ""academically acceptable"" in 2004, 2009 and 2010, according to the spreadsheet. 
Culbertson said the school, launched in 1998, at one point had permission to enroll students in pre-kindergarten through 12th grade. 
To get a sense of why the school drew its low ratings, we peeked at campus rating reports for 2005 through 2009 and 2010, starting from an education agency web page. 
The reports indicated that the number of students taking state-mandated tests fluctuated from about 40 to a little more than 60. Basically, too, according to the summaries, the school’s ""academically unacceptable"" ratings arose from students not showing state-required improvements on the tests, though each report also had bright spots. In 2007, for instance, students generally showed sufficient improvement in social studies and math, the summary says, and students living in economically disadvantaged circumstances made required improvements in reading. But students fell short of required improvements on state writing and science tests and among subgroups, economically disadvantaged students fell short in math, according to the summary. 
Culbertson told us the school drew its ""academically acceptable"" rating in 2009, despite showing a failure to meet required improvement across five subcategories, because the state that year judged schools based on projected improvement.

Surrendered charter 
We identified one other significant twist. The Uvalde school closed in August 2010, Culbertson said by telephone, citing low enrollment. A separate Gabriel Tafolla Academy had opened in August 2009, she said, and it lasted through 2011-12 before the entire charter school district folded and returned its charter to the state. That shutdown happened for financial reasons, according to a June 2012 letter sent to the state by the academy’s chief officer, Deanna Kilpatrick. A closure resolution was approved June 7, 2012, by the Community Council of Southwest Texas, which held the charter. 
By phone, Sunset staff aide Sarah Kirkle told us two of three charter schools shown on the chart as having been rated ""academically unacceptable"" for six non-consecutive years similarly were no longer operating by early 2012, while the third school appeared to have improved performance and remains in business. 
Ratliff, apprised of what we learned, said that when he made his statement, he thought the charter school had been rated unacceptable for seven straight years and remained in business. On both fronts, he said, ""I am probably in error,"" though he said it’s still troubling that a school could have multiple years of unacceptable ratings and not be shuttered by the state.

Our ruling

Ratliff said: ""We have one charter school that for seven years has been rated unacceptable.""

His present-tense statement struck us as suggesting a school had been rated unacceptable seven straight years and was somehow still chugging. 
Both conclusions are incorrect, though the statement has an element of truth. The state rated a Uvalde school ""academically unacceptable"" for three straight years, 2000 through 2002, and four straight years, 2005 through 2008. 
However, the school closed before the beginning of the 2010-11 school year. It had been out of business more than two years when Ratliff referred to it.

"['Georgia', 'Jobs', 'Workers', 'Nathan Deal']","
Portrait of state government workers has gaps
","
During a speech last month at the Atlanta Press Club, Gov. Nathan Deal lauded state workers for what they do and for doing it without pay increases. In fact, it’s been six years since an across-the-board merit pay bump, he said. And that’s led to some negative results. 
""The state of Georgia lost 16 percent of our employees last year and that percentage has risen over the last three years,"" Deal said. ""So when people are being siphoned off out of state government into private business because the salaries are so much more favorable, then those are things the state has to be cognizant of."" 
We wanted to know more about Deal’s 16 percent claim, so we decided to check it out. 
Deal spokesman Brian Robinson provided us a chart showing the turnover trend of employees leaving state government for fiscal years 2002 through 2012. The chart was produced by the state’s Department of Administrative Services, which acts as the central human resources agency for state employees. The numbers showed: 
Fiscal year        % of state workforce          state jobs 
2012                16.43%        70,197 
2011                15.60%        71,837 
2010                13.84%        77,934 
2009                13.62%        82,001 
The state workforce figures for fiscal years 2009 and 2010 include part-time employees. But that amount is likely very small. For example, it accounted for 119 employees in fiscal 2012. 
So the governor was correct in his three years assessment. But what do those numbers mean? 
His statement was made in the context of employees leaving the state for better private-sector jobs. But do the turnover numbers only count those employees, or do they also include people who’ve left for other reasons? 
For answers, we went to Candy Sarvis, deputy commissioner of the human resources division of the Administrative Services Department. Sarvis could only provide detailed information on the fiscal 2012 data, which her department compiled. Data before then were compiled by the now-defunct State Personnel Administration. Sarvis’ division used the data prior to fiscal 2012 as it was presented and didn’t go back to verify the numbers, she said. 
For fiscal 2012, Sarvis said, the percentages include all full-time, benefit-eligible employees who have left their jobs voluntarily, as well as through firings, layoffs, retirements, etc. 
Also of note, the percentages do not account for employees of the University System of Georgia or the Board of Regents for that system. The University System employed 43,020 workers in fiscal 2012, but no information on employee turnover was available, a spokesman said. 
Also, based on provided jobs numbers, the decrease in state workers was about 14 percent over the past four fiscal years. And from fiscal 2011 to 2012 the drop in jobs was just 2 percent, which is likely to mean that many of the open or vacated positions were filled. 
For the state turnover data provided, the turnover trend was higher in the years leading up to the recession but dropped during the recession. 
Georgia’s trends mirror national trends, according to data compiled by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Nationally, the turnover rate for all levels of government is about 16 percent. 
Gary Burtless, a senior economics fellow with the Brookings Institution, has studied the data. 
The quit rate -- or the number of employees who quit during a month as a percentage of total employment -- remains lower in the public sector than the private sector, according to multiyear BLS data compiled by Burtless. The quit rate has edged up, he said, but for both sectors, it is still lower than it was in the decade before the recession. 
""If experienced workers are afraid to quit their jobs, there is less pressure on employers -- including public employers -- to grant their employees sizable wage increases,"" Burtless said. 
Deal also discussed the state’s workforce last year. He touted personnel cuts made by his administration, but he left out University System data that changed the numbers and his statement was rated Mostly False. 
So, do Deal’s figures add up this time around? 
The governor said that 16 percent of the state government’s workforce was ""lost"" during the past fiscal year. Deal made the comments in the context of how employees receiving no raises has affected the state’s workforce, which has decreased the past four fiscal years. 
A closer look at the numbers shows that Deal’s 16 percent figure also includes employees who have left their positions through layoffs, retirement, and other reasons -- including voluntary resignations. And in the case of voluntary resignations, the state doesn’t track information on these employees to determine whether they left for other jobs. Also, the figure doesn’t include data for most of the state’s colleges and Board of Regents. 
Deal’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and context.

Bill Hammond says only 25 percent of Texas high-school graduates are career- or college-ready
","
As the Texas Senate approved a bill to reduce state-mandated exams in public schools, business leader Bill Hammond decried the measure. 
Hammond, president of the Texas Association of Business, said, ""We already graduate only 25 percent of students who are career- or college-ready. I don’t understand why many of our lawmakers are dead set on running away from strong requirements meant to increase that number and put in place standards that will do just the opposite,"" according to a May 6, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news story. 
Are all but a quarter of Texas high school graduates unprepared for jobs or college? 
Association spokesman Robert Wood emailed us an Aug. 22, 2012, report from ACT, a nonprofit organization that administers a nationwide college admissions and placement test, about Texas’ graduating class of 2012. 
Among the 110,180 high schoolers in Texas who took the ACT that year -- accounting for 39 percent of the graduating class, according to the report -- 24 percent met the group’s ""College Readiness Benchmarks"" in all four subjects tested (English, reading, math and science), compared to 25 percent nationally. 
Thirty-two percent of Texas test-takers hit none of the benchmarks -- or, put another way, 68 percent of the students hit at least one. 
ACT’s report said its benchmarks indicate preparedness for careers as well as college. 
Wood emailed us a March 21, 2013, Dallas Morning News interview with state higher education commissioner Raymund Paredes in which Paredes is quoted as saying ACT data show 25 percent are college-ready ""across the board."" 
The benchmarks, according to an ACT press release accompanying the report, are ""based on actual grades earned in college by ACT-tested students."" ACT calculates, for each subject, the minimum ACT score that indicates a student has a 75 percent chance of earning a C or a 50 percent chance of earning a B in a first-year college course in that subject, the release said. 
Via email, ACT spokesman Ed Colby noted that Hammond was citing the percentage of Texas graduates who missed the benchmarks in four subjects. 
Colby offered a less stringent measure. In ACT’s view, he said, students who hit three out of four benchmarks ""still have a good chance of succeeding in college."" So a student could miss one of the benchmarks without being considered by ACT ""at risk of not succeeding in college and career,"" he said. 
""Last year, 40 percent of ACT-tested graduates nationally (39 percent in Texas) met at least three of our four benchmarks,"" Colby said. ""We would argue that is a fairer figure to quote when talking about overall college and career readiness, but that is open to interpretation."" 
Texas’ ACT benchmark results have stayed relatively steady in recent years, rising or falling by no more than four percentage points from 2008 through 2012, according to ACT. As in 2012, for instance, 24 percent of Texas’ 2011 graduates taking the ACT met all four subject-matter benchmarks and 39 percent met three or more. 
The College Board, a nonprofit organization that administers the SAT college admissions tests, also sets a benchmark for ""college and career readiness"": a score of 1550, which the board’s website says ""is associated with a 65 percent probability of obtaining a first year (grade point average) of a B- or higher."" 
Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson emailed us College Board reports for Texas showing that among students who took the SAT tests, 33 percent in the class of 2011 and 32 percent in the class of 2012 hit the benchmark. Like the ACT, SAT tests are taken not by all high school graduates but typically by students who already intend to enroll in college; 54 percent of Texas’ 2011 grads and 58 percent of 2012 grads took SATs. 
The state agency cites its own indicator of how well high-school graduates are prepared for college. Spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us by email, ""Based on the state 2012 Academic Excellence Indicator System report, 52 percent of the class of 2011 graduates met the college-ready criteria in both ELA (English language arts) and mathematics."" 
Time for some unpacking: In that report, Ratcliffe said, students were considered ""college-ready"" if they met or exceeded college criteria on one or more of three standardized tests: the ACT, the SAT or the Texas Assessment of Knowledge and Skills exit-level test. Specifically, Ratcliffe said, the 52 percent figure represents graduates who made or exceeded certain English and math scores on the TAKS, SAT or ACT. 
So three varied ways of calculating suggest that 32 percent, 39 percent and 52 percent of students in recent years were prepared for college. 
By telephone, Hammond agreed there are other ways of measuring college readiness. Even ACT’s own data ""is saying two different things,"" he said, referring to the four-part ACT measurement he initially cited and the three-of-four approach offered to us by the ACT spokesman. 
Hammond offered for perspective a statistic from the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board indicating that about 30 percent of Texas high school graduates who went straight into a Texas college or university in fall 2011 needed catch-up classes in math, reading or writing. 
Our ruling 
Hammond said only 25 percent of Texas high school graduates are college- or career-ready. 
While there is a method behind his conclusion, even the purveyor of that figure, ACT, says it prefers a lower threshold for gauging whether students are college- or career-ready. Besides, there are at least two other indicators, one from the company that runs the SAT and the other from the state of Texas, suggesting that up to half of the state’s high-school graduates are ready for college. 
Hammond’s claim fails to reflect the variety of college-readiness indicators. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/24/bill-hammond/bill-hammond-says-only-25-percent-texas-high-schoo/
"['Oregon', 'Children', 'Families', 'Health Care', 'Women', 'Carolyn Tomei']","
Were half of all pregnancies in Oregon unintended?
","
In honor of National Women’s Health Week, Oregon Rep. Carolyn Tomei, D-Milwaukie, talked up the benefits of a health initiative that encourages primary care providers to ask women whether they wish to get pregnant within the year or not. 
The goal is to provide prenatal care to women who want a baby and contraception options to those who do not. Unintended pregnancies stress out family finances as well as taxpayers, who pick up the cost for half of all births in Oregon, Tomei said on the floor of the Oregon House.   
""In Oregon in 2010, 49 percent of all pregnancies were unintended. Fifty-three percent of all deliveries were paid for by Medicaid,"" she said. 
PolitiFact Oregon was intrigued by the statistic that nearly half of all pregnancies in Oregon in 2010 were unintended. How would anyone track that? What does it mean? Plus, we wanted to know if Medicaid -- a portion of which is called the Oregon Health Plan in Oregon -- paid for 53 percent of all deliveries.   
PRAMS  
Tomei said she relied on information from the Oregon Health Authority’s Pregnancy Risk Assessment Monitoring Systemsurvey. The questions asked of a sampling of new mothers include alcohol consumption, child safety, breast feeding and family planning. 
Here’s the question Tomei said was relevant to this fact check: When you got pregnant with your new baby, were you trying to get pregnant? 
In 2010, 46.4 percent of new mothers surveyed said they were not trying to get pregnant. Nearly 53 percent of women said that the Oregon Health Plan or Medicaid helped pay for delivery, according to the survey. So part of what she said on the floor is backed up by the Oregon Health Authority, but the statement we’re checking is off by a few percentage points. 
At the same time, we found an analysis by PolitiFact Rhode Island, which checked a similar claim by a R.I. state representative who said in 2011 that ""nearly half of all pregnancies in the U.S. are unintended."" The representative received a True. 
The source was the Guttmacher Institute, a New York City-based group well known for its research on reproductive health. Researchers reported 49 percent of pregnancies in the United States were unintendedin 2006. In Oregon, 49 percent of pregnancies were unintended as well. 
So Tomei might be correct, albeit for a different year, based on Guttmacher. But bear with us, because the issue, we learned, is rather complicated. 
An unintended pregnancy is defined by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Oregon Health Authority as one where the woman wanted to be pregnant later or not at all. An intended pregnancy is one where the woman wanted to be pregnant at that moment, or sooner. 
However, and this is important, the ""pregnancy intendedness"" question on the PRAMS survey is not the one that Tomei relied on to derive intention. 
In 2010, the percentage of new moms who wanted to be pregnant at that moment, or sooner, was 63.3. The percentage of new moms who wanted to be pregnant later or not at all was 36.6, and not 49 percent or 46.4 percent. 
A 2012 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention finds Oregon is the norm: about 37 percent of births in the United States in 2006-10 stemmed from unintended pregnancies. 
So why are Guttmacher numbers higher? The group based its analysis on all pregnancies, including those resulting in births, abortions and miscarriages. We can see how that would increase the percentage of mistimed or unwanted pregnancies. 
The question relied on by Tomei has to do with family planning. The other question has to do with ""pregnancy intendedness."" We honestly doubt the average person -- even a lawmaker -- could tell the difference without explanatory assistance from public health officials. 
The ruling 
If you accept Tomei’s interpretation of intended as meaning ""trying to get pregnant,"" 49 percent is just a few points shy of 46. 4 percent. We’d give that a Mostly True since the numbers are so close. 
If you want to stick to a more rigid definition of unintended pregnancy, she would also be largely correct, albeit for the year 2006, based on the Guttmacher statistic. Remember, Guttmacher includes a broader universe of pregnancies, including not only births but abortions and miscarriages as well.   
Tomei would not be correct, however, based on the intendedness question in the PRAMS survey, which limits results to new moms who gave birth in 2010. And, according to a state epidemiologist with whom we spoke, this question is perhaps not the best way to gauge intention. 
PolitiFact Oregon rates the accuracy of the statement, not the ins and outs of the survey from which the statement comes. In the colloquial sense, Tomei is off by a few points. In the survey sense, she is backed up by a national study, although for a different year. We find those two factors are enough to find her statement accurate, but needing both clarification and additional information. 
We rule the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/24/carolyn-tomei/were-half-all-pregnancies-oregon-unintended/

Maryland group says fingerprinting gun purchasers has reduced gun crime rates in five states
","
With the debate over gun control still simmering, a reader asked us to fact-check an ad on Baltimore TV stations that promotes tough laws on gun purchases. 
The ad, was put together by Marylanders to Prevent Gun Violence, a group headed by Vincent DeMarco, an adjunct assistant professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. (We have written previously about the Bloomberg School’s role in gun policy research.) 
The group, whose board is chock full of Maryland political leaders, supported the gun-control bill signed earlier this year by Democratic Gov. Martin O’Malley. The group is now trying to shore up public support as the law faces expected legal challenges from the National Rifle Association and others. 
The ad focuses on fingerprint licensing laws. Under those laws, a potential gun purchaser must first obtain a license from law enforcement, which includes being fingerprinted, before being able to purchase a handgun. This is currently the law in Connecticut, Hawaii, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York. 
Here’s the text of the ad, voiced by people identified on screen as a gun owner, a pastor and a mother: 
""Something had to be done, and here in Maryland we stood up and joined the governor and the Legislature to pass real solutions that reduce gun violence by getting weapons out of the hands of criminals, with a fingerprint licensing law that 68 percent of gun owners like me support, a requirement that's reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law. It will work for Maryland, and it could work for the entire country."" 
We wondered if the fingerprint laws have ""reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law""? 
By using the term ""reduced,"" the ad is saying that gun crime was high before passage of these laws, and then dropped after they were enacted. 
But that’s not what the data shows. In fact, there's no data that shows the crimes declined, nor whether the fingerprint laws were the reason. 
We checked with Daniel W. Webster, director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research and a professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, which the group has cited as a source. 
Webster agreed that the text of the ad could have been phrased more carefully. 
""It would be more accurate to state that states with fingerprint-verified handgun purchaser licensing have much lower rates of gun homicide than states that do not,"" Webster said. He presented the following data for age-adjusted firearm homicide rates per 100,000 population between 1999 and 2010 for both the U.S. overall and for the five states with fingerprint-verified handgun purchaser licensing. The chart was compiled using data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

All this data shows is that states with the fingerprint law have lower firearm homicide rates, not that the rate fell after enactment of the fingerprint law. 
""Most of the laws were passed many decades ago, and there have not been studies to estimate their impact on violent crime,"" Webster said. 
There is some backhanded support for the ad’s claim in the one state -- Missouri -- that did the reverse when it rescinded its licensing requirement for gun purchasers in 2007. Webster said that following the law’s repeal, gun homicide rates increased by 25 percent between 1999-2007 and 2008-2010. (The Missouri case is analyzed here and here.) 
There also another problem with the ad’s phrasing: It was imprecise in using the term ""gun crimes."" The supporting data Webster cited refers to firearm homicide rates, which is just one subset of gun crimes. The FBI tracks gun robberies and gun assaults in addition to gun homicides. 
At least two politicians, O’Malley and Maryland state Sen. Brian Frosh, have been quoted in news reports offering versions of the claim that are more accurate. So how did the ad’s narration get mangled? 
DeMarco, the group’s president, told PolitiFact that his group ""ran the script of the ad by Prof. Webster before running it and he approved it as accurate."" 
But Webster responded by telling us that he approved the following language: 
""In the five states where fingerprint licensing is currently required for handgun purchases, gun death rates are among the lowest in the nation. According to experts at the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research, cities in states with handgun purchaser licensing laws have much lower rates of within-state illegal gun trafficking than those without licensing. According to the Center, ‘research suggests that, once implemented, Maryland’s handgun purchaser licensing law will reduce gun trafficking, gun crime, and gun homicides and can serve as a national model for other states.’"" 
Somewhere along the way, the more accurate language got lost in translation. 
Our ruling 
The ad said that mandating the fingerprinting of those seeking to purchase a gun is ""a requirement that's reduced gun crimes in the five states where it's the law."" 
But that’s not a correct description of the statistics. Firearm homicide rates are lower in the five states that have such laws, but experts told us there are no before-and-after comparisons in those states to show that gun-crime rates were ""reduced"" after fingerprinting laws took effect. In addition, the ad refers to ""gun crimes,"" but the supporting data looks specifically at gun homicides, not robberies and assaults committed with guns. 
The differences in wording are subtle, but at PolitiFact, one of our core principles is that the words used to make political claims matter. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/23/marylanders-prevent-gun-violence-education-fund/ad-maryland-group-says-fingerprinting-gun-purchase/

NJ AFL-CIO claims Chris Christie cut education funding by $1.6B while giving out $2B in corporate tax breaks
","
The attack ad game for New Jersey’s gubernatorial contest in November has a new player. 
Enter the state AFL-CIO, which has a meme on its Facebook page that links Gov. Chris Christie to big business and paints him as an enemy of education. A meme is an idea or concept shared via social media. 
The meme declares, ""New Jersey's governor cut $1.6 billion from public education while handing out $2.1 billion in corporate tax breaks, more than the entire previous decade,"" with a prominent picture of a dazed-looking Christie in the middle. 
The picture may not be the most flattering, but the claims in it are hard facts: New Jersey’s governor did cut education by a significant amount, and his actions have resulted in tax break largesse for businesses. 
Let’s begin by reviewing the education funding claim. 
Christie cut education funding, but not by $1.6 billion. 
The governor made two cuts to education in 2010 totaling about $1 billion to help close significant budget gaps. The New Jersey Education Law Center, a Newark-based school advocacy group, sued, claiming the cuts violated the law for giving aid to school districts, and put at-risk and poor students at an increased disadvantage. 
Ultimately, a judge agreed with the Education Law Center’s challenge. The judge also found that New Jersey would have needed $1.6 billion to fully fund education in New Jersey in accordance with the state’s funding law, and ordered the state to spend an additional $500 million on public education in poor districts the next year. 
Bottom line? Christie’s cuts totaled $1 billion. 
Next, let’s review the claim about corporate tax breaks. 
New Jersey Policy Perspective, a liberal think tank, released a report in April that the state has given $2.1 billion in tax breaks and grants to companies during the past three years that Christie’s been in office. That exceeds the $1.2 billion in corporate tax breaks given the entire previous decade, according to figures from the state Economic Development Authority. 
At the time of the report’s release, Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said the group is ""simply not credible,"" and that figures from the EDA show that incentives have created more than 100,000 jobs since 1996. 
What Drewniak didn’t do, however, was question the accuracy of the numbers in the report. 
It’s also worth noting that a month before the report came out, Christie told a commercial real estate group that his administration was on target to deliver $2.3 billion in business tax breaks and supports legislation reauthorizing corporate incentives. 
NJPP used EDA numbers for its study, Deputy Director Jon Whiten said in an e-mail.. 
Neither Drewniak nor Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts responded to requests for comment. 
Our ruling 
A meme on the state AFL-CIO Facebook page claims, ""New Jersey's governor cut $1.6 billion from public education while handing out $2.1 billion in corporate tax breaks, more than the entire previous decade."" 
Christie actually cut $1 billion in state aid from education, not $1.6 billion. 
As for corporate tax breaks, Christie himself has said his administration is on target to deliver $2.3 billion in benefits for business – and that’s nearly double what was handed out in tax breaks in the decade before he took office. 
We rate the meme’s claim Mostly True.

University of Rhode Island professor says black- or brown-skinned people are nine times more likely to be stopped and frisked in New York City
","
Amid the ongoing debate over whether Rhode Island should arm its campus police, several University of Rhode Island faculty members expressed concern that students, especially minority students, could be targeted by police who haven’t been adequately trained. 
(The state Board of Education is expected to vote on the issue Thursday night.) 
One of the URI opponents is Lynne Derbyshire, an associate professor of communication studies and women’s studies. 
""All of us who have grown up in the U.S. have grown up making distinctions with regard to skin color,"" Derbyshire was quoted as saying in the May 16 Providence Journal. ""If you are black or brown, you are nine times more likely to be stopped and frisked. If we arm campus police, we are potentially endangering students of color."" 
We were curious about her claim on minorities. Are they really being stopped and frisked nine times more frequently than whites? 
We e-mailed her and asked for her source. She responded quickly, saying she had told the reporter that the data involved New York City, an element not mentioned in the story. We checked with the reporter, who said that Derbyshire had also mentioned other estimates reflecting racial bias, such as a study saying that persons of color are five times more likely to be stopped by police while driving on Route 95. 
We decided to check the New York numbers. 
She subsequently sent us a link to a 2009 study by the Center for Constitutional Rights, which was suing the City of New York on behalf of people who claimed they were being stopped and frisked simply because of race. (The trial ended Monday; a federal judge is expected to issue a decision later this year.) 
The city's stop-and-frisk policy, implemented in 2002, has sparked conflicting claims, with critics saying the pattern of stops illustrates a racial bias and supporters saying that it has kept the streets safer. 
Using data collected by police from 2005 to the first half of 2008, the center concluded that 8 percent of those frisked were whites, who make up 44 percent of the city's population. In comparison, 85 percent of those frisked were blacks and Latinos, who make up 53 percent of the population. That's 10 times more frequent if you adjust for the city racial makeup -- close to the figure Derbyshire cited. 
But the report also shows that odds of being frisked if you're white increased over those years, reducing the racial disparity. When we looked at the report's numbers for 2007, the frisk rate was 15 percent for whites, 35 percent for Latinos and 51 percent for blacks. If you adjust for population, blacks and Latinos were 4.8 times more likely to be frisked than whites. 
Finally, when we analyzed the 2011 data, available through the website of the New York Civil Liberties Union, things had apparently gotten worse; adjusted for the 2010 population balance, blacks and Latinos were 7.5 times more likely to be frisked in cases where race was listed. 
The data show that the biggest factor is the racial disparity among people stopped in the first place. Among those stopped, only 11 percent were white. Once stopped, whites were patted down 41 percent of the time compared with 54 percent for blacks and 55 percent for Latinos. 
But things get more complicated. 
When the RAND Corporation, the nonprofit global policy think tank, analyzed the data, it warned that the technique of comparing the frisk numbers to the population profile ""has been widely discredited"" as a gauge for racial profiling. The reason: if the suspects in most of the crimes in a particular neighborhood involve people of a particular race, an unbiased police department is naturally going to be stopping more people of that race. 
RAND, which was hired by the New York City Police Foundation, tried other admittedly imperfect ways to compare the racial balance of the people actually stopped with the pattern one would expect if police behavior was untainted by racism. RAND still saw bias, but the degree was much smaller. 
For example, when it came to being frisked once stopped, the rates under comparable circumstances, were 29 percent for whites, 34 percent for blacks and 33 percent for Latinos; a difference, but not a huge one. 
The RAND study, in turn, sparked its own criticism. An analysis by a Columbia University professor said the study ""strongly understates the racial disparities"" in the likelihood of being frisked. 
And then another study by the National Bureau of Economic Research found there was no racial bias on the part of the New York City Police Department, at least among blacks. 
To put this in perspective, these studies are trying to assess the deeper question of whether the numbers translate into racism. Derbyshire's statement, made in the context of concerns about racism, simply says that the odds of being stopped and frisked are nine times higher for those who aren't white. 
How likely is it that any of these findings would apply to the URI campus where Derbyshire teaches? 
The best-known studies of racial profiling by police in Rhode Island were released in 2003 and 2006. But they involved drivers, not pedestrians. The 2003 analysis found that non-white drivers were 2-1/2 times as likely to be searched than white drivers, even though police were more likely to find contraband among the whites. A followup study three years later, showed only modest improvement. 
Our ruling 
Lynne Derbyshire, arguing against arming campus police in Rhode Island, said, ""If you are black or brown, you are nine times more likely to be stopped and frisked"" by police in New York City. The context in which she made her statement suggests that such racial profiling is a threat for students here. 
We don't believe that population-wide data from the nation's largest city, which has had an aggressive stop and frisk policy for more than a decade, are particularly relevant to a debate involving two state colleges, neither of which are in an urban setting, and a rural university which has an annex in downtown Providence. 
But if we apply the Truth-O-Meter to the New York data, the study Derbyshire supplied showed a tenfold risk of being frisked if you are black or Latino in New York City. Newer data show that that risk is somewhat less than she said. 
We'll leave it to others to debate the degree of racism reflected in the numbers, but Derbyshire's statement about the probability of being frisked if you are a person of color in New York City is close enough to the latest data to warrant a Mostly True.

Tax code allows groups to spend on undisclosed donations on political campaigns, says Xavier Becerra
","
The fallout from the Internal Revenue Service’s tougher scrutiny of tea party groups continues with former IRS officials testifying that they never tried to mislead Congress about IRS practices. 
Republican senators like Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, were openly skeptical. ""You lied by omission,"" Hatch said. 
President Barack Obama and Democrats have criticized the excesses of the IRS. But some would like to shift the focus to the legal ambiguity that allows some tax-exempt groups to engage in politics without revealing their donors, as formal campaign organizations must do. 
The chair of the House Democratic Caucus, Xavier Becerra of California, promoted that line during an appearance on NBC’s Meet the Press. 
""We have a tax code that allows groups to use their political operations within the tax code, under the guise of a charity, to use undisclosed millions of dollars to do political campaigns,"" Becerra said. 
We checked whether charities actually can engage in politics and the experts we reached were quite clear. If by charities, you mean groups with 501(c)(3) status, the law says they can’t. 
""If Rep. Becerra had used the term ‘tax-exempt organizations’ rather than the word ‘charities,’ his statement would be correct,"" said Brett Kappel, counsel at the Washington law firm Arent Fox. Kappel represented the Ron Paul 2012 campaign. 
""Charities are 501(c)(3) organizations and cannot engage in any partisan political activities,"" Kappel continued. ""501(c)(4) social welfare organizations are tax exempt, but they are not charities. They can engage in partisan political activities as long as they are not the organization's primary activity."" 
Becerra said his target was 501(c)(4) groups and notes that the tax code spells out that for such groups, their net income should be ""devoted exclusively to charitable, educational, or recreational purposes."" 
""Charitable is another form of the word charity,"" Becerra told PolitiFact. ""I used that word because Americans understand it and they associate it with something good, not groups that are in the business to do politics. If I had said 501(c)(4), they would have understood everything except that term."" 
There are thousands of tax-exempt organizations that have the legal right to try to shape the course of legislative votes and elections. They could be a chamber of commerce, a child welfare organization that presses for certain legislation, or powerful political players like Crossroads GPS, founded by Republican strategist Karl Rove. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Crossroads GPS spent $70 million on television ads and other media in the last election. 
For the curious, here’s how the rules breakdown for the different groups: 
• Charities - 501(c)(3): Donations are tax deductible; donors go unreported; no political activity allowed 
• Social Welfare - 501(c)(4): Donations are not tax deductible; donors go unreported; some political activity allowed. 
• Super PAC - 527 groups: Donations are not tax deductible; donors are reported; political activity allowed. 
Social Welfare Organizations 
IRS regulations define a social welfare organization as one that is ""primarily engaged in promoting in some way the common good and general welfare of the people of the community, i.e., primarily for the purpose of bringing about civic betterment and social improvements."" 
Since civic betterment is in the eye of the beholder, a group can form around virtually any cause. It can raise money to support its activities, and ever since the U.S. Supreme Court’s decision in the Citizens United case, it has a relatively free hand to try to shape the outcomes of elections. 
Kenneth Gross is a former lawyer for the Federal Elections Commission and now heads the political law practice at the Washington firm of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher and Flom. Gross says the Citizens United decision gave 501(c)(4) groups considerable leeway. 
""They can run ads that say don't vote for some candidate,"" Gross said. ""They can go very strong, so long as they can say they are predominantly a social welfare organization."" 
Gross noted that spending on campaign ads triggers the need to report the expenditures to the FEC, and to that extent, disclosure is part of the picture. Brad Smith, law professor at Capital University School of Law in Columbus, Ohio, says Becerra is wrong to ignore the FEC reporting. 
""We know how much (c)(4)’s spent, we know what they spent it on and what candidates they supported or opposed,"" Smith said. ""All we don't know are the names of individual donors."" 
But that Bercerra told us, was his point. Disclosure of donors, their names and the amounts they gave, is never required. This goes back to a 1958 Supreme Court ruling involving the NAACP. In that decision, the court said keeping membership lists private is essential to protecting the constitutional right to assemble. 
Becerra made his comments in the middle of a discussion about whether the public should know the backers of groups that intervene in politics. If a candidate, political party, an ordinary political action committee or a Super PAC raises money, it must report its donors. But not a 501(c)(4). So long as the group can argue that most of their other activities are aimed at nonpolitical social welfare goals, it can engage in hardcore political work. 
""This controversy is 100 percent about disclosure,"" Gross said. 
How much is too much 
The crunch point in the debate over 501(c)(4) organizations is the fuzziness over what percentage of their effort goes toward engaging in bare knuckles politics. IRS rules say such groups must be organized exclusively for the promotion of social welfare, but in terms of how much political work they do, the rules limit that only in a relative sense. The political effort can not be their ""primary activity."" 
The IRS does not define its terms. ""Some lawyers say, so long as it’s 49.99 percent, it’s okay,"" said Gross. ""But there is no percentage in the regulations."" 
Allison Hayward, an attorney and a board member of the House Office of Congressional Ethics, says the IRS decides whether a group is following the rules based on a test that evaluates ""facts and circumstances."" 
""It is a test that doesn’t offer a lot of clarity,"" Hayward said. 
Our ruling 
Becerra said the tax code allows charities to spend undisclosed millions to do political campaigns. Becerra might have used the word ""charities"" too broadly to describe the tax-exempt organizations that rely on this wrinkle of the tax code. Becerra said he was trying to use language that most people would understand instead of the tax code’s technical term of a 501(c)(4) group. He’s right that these organizations can raise millions to engage in politics, and they need not reveal their donors.

Rep. Ron Maag says 46 percent of Medicaid expansion money would be borrowed from foreign governments that don’t “like us very much”
","
Free money from Washington sure sounds enticing. But State Rep. Ron Maag, a Southwest Ohio Republican, says he doesn’t believe it’s really free. 
That’s one reason Maag does not want Ohio to expand Medicaid, the joint federal-state healthcare program for low-income Americans. The expansion money would come from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, providing states with Medicaid cash to enroll residents earning up to 138 percent of the poverty level. The federal government would provide full funding for the first three years, and then 90 percent. 
Besides skepticism about how much more Ohio might ultimately have to cover, Maag, of Warren County, doubts the federal government can really afford its portion, either. ""Forty-six cents of every dollar that we would be getting from Washington, D.C., is going to come from China or some other country that doesn’t like us very much,"" he said at an Ohio House Finance and Appropriations Committee hearing on April 12. 
Plenty of Ohio Republicans have doubts about expanding Medicaid, but Maag’s statement stood out because it sounded contrary to federal assessments about the program’s financing. So we asked Maag to explain his claim. 
He told us in a telephone interview that the federal government already borrows 46 cents of every dollar it spends. He based that on a Congressional Budget Office, or CBO, report issued in December. 
The CBO report that Maag cited was a monthly review that showed the amount of money the government had spent (the outlays) so far in the fiscal year; the amount of revenue it took in (chiefly from taxes), and the difference between the two. The difference was in the negative column. That means the government had a deficit and must borrow to cover it. 
Divide the deficit by the outlays and you get the figure Maag stated -- 46 cents of every dollar spent as of that moment was deficit spending. That is not a projection, Maag said. ""It’s an absolute."" 
It was, at least, last December.  And the percentage figure, 46, was high, prompting the Washington Times and several other media outlets to report it. 
But this CBO budget report covered a relatively narrow time frame, only two months. What would happen if you looked at a broader period, using the most current CBO report, issued May 7? Or the April report that was issued a week before Maag spoke? 
The deficit figure would change -- or, rather, it has changed. The CBO monthly review issued on April 5 provided figures for the first six months of the current fiscal year. They showed a lower level of deficits: 34 cents for every dollar of federal spending. 
Why had the deficit figure gone down? 
Part of it was due to more tax activity from an improving economy. Revenues were about 12 percent higher than for the same period in 2012 and spending was 3 percent lower, the CBO said. 
This was not a fluke. Subsequent CBO reports have noted the same thing: As the economy has improved, tax revenues have gone up and deficits down. 
OK, so the deficits are shrinking and Maag had not yet read the latest monthly CBO figures.  (Doesn’t everyone in the Ohio General Assembly?) Let’s put aside the exact figure, for it is still a deficit. What about Maag’s broader point -- that Medicaid expansion under Obamacare would result in more deficit spending? 
That is not what the CBO -- the same nonpartisan office whose work Maag mentioned in defending part of this claim -- projects.  The CBO has examined this several times, working with the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. 
Obamacare has costs, chiefly the cost of expanding health coverage with Medicaid and with subsidies for individuals and small employers who lack insurance, cannot afford it and cannot qualify for Medicaid. But it also has savings. 
Some of the savings are supposed to come from reducing the amount of money the federal government now pays to hospitals to care for the uninsured. In Ohio alone, the government will pay hospitals $7.4 billion less over the next 10 years, according to testimony to state lawmakers from Mike Abrams, president and CEO of the Ohio Hospital Association. 
Additionally, the federal government will get money from taxes on high-premium or ""Cadillac"" health care policies, from taxes on medical device sales, from penalties on employers who fail to provide insurance and, according to projections, from cuts and efficiencies geared to slow the growth rate of Medicare, the federal program for seniors. 
When the Affordable Care Act passed in 2010, the CBO said the net savings would reduce deficits over 10 years by $143 billion. The CBO has taken a few additional swipes at this, and each time its projections show deficit reduction. When asked last year to examine what would happen if Obamacare were repealed, the CBO said deficits would grow by $109 billion between 2012 and 2022. Even though government costs would go down if Obamacare were repealed, so would the revenue and savings built into the health care bill. 
So we circle back to Maag’s claim that ""Forty-six cents of every dollar that we would be getting from Washington, D.C. would come from China or some other country that doesn’t like us very much."" His number was wrong and out of date. The CBO, whose projections both parties rely on, says deficits will go down, not up. We need not take up the last part of his sentence -- that the money would come from countries like China or others who don’t like the United States very much. But for the record, the Pentagon said last year that it does not view China’s holding of United States debt as a threat. 
Maag’s instincts tell him he is right. But the facts, projections and law, as they exist today, do not support his claim. We rate it False.",/factchecks/2013/may/22/ron-maag/rep-ron-maag-says-46-percent-medicaid-expansion-mo/

Randy Forbes says taxpayers have burden of proof when facing IRS
","
The Internal Revenue Service has been on the defensive since the news broke that the agency has been giving extra scrutiny to conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Among the lawmakers expressing concern about the IRS was Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va. 
In a May 17, 2013, interview, Fox News anchor Gretchen Carlson asked Forbes, ""What's your No. 1 concern about the IRS being in charge of Obamacare?"" (Carlson was wrong about the agency's role. It is not ""in charge,"" as we addressed with our recent fact-check of Michele Bachmann.) 
Forbes responded, ""Well, Gretchen, first of all, it is the power that the IRS has that's different than any other agency, any other department. … The IRS doesn't have to prove something against you. They can walk in and you've got the burden of proof."" 
The idea that the ""burden of proof"" rests on the accuser is a bedrock principle of justice around the world. While neither of the terms ""burden of proof"" or ""presumption of innocence"" appears in the U.S Constitution, an accuser’s burden of proving that someone has committed a criminal act goes back to ancient times. In 1895, when the Supreme Court issued a resounding defense of the concept in the case Coffin vs. United States, it cited sources as varied as the Bible, Sparta, Athens and Rome. ""The principle that there is a presumption of innocence in favor of the accused is the undoubted law, axiomatic and elementary, and its enforcement lies at the foundation of the administration of our criminal law,"" the court wrote. 
So we wondered whether it’s really the case that the IRS ""doesn't have to prove something against you. … You've got the burden of proof."" 
The ways in which Forbes is correct 
Saving receipts and canceled checks in case the IRS calls is all too familiar to many taxpayers. And generally speaking -- beyond some exceptions that we’ll outline below -- the burden of supplying information is indeed on the taxpayer when he or she is told by the IRS that they underpaid their taxes or when they face an IRS audit. 
This is a ""traditional rule, going back a long way,"" said David Weisbach, a University of Chicago law professor who worked earlier in his career as an attorney-advisor in the Department of Treasury’s Office of the Tax Legislative Counsel. 
The IRS lays out the specifics on a Web page titled ""Burden of Proof."" 
""The responsibility to prove entries, deductions, and statements made on your tax returns is known as the burden of proof,"" it says. ""You must be able to prove … certain elements of expenses to deduct them. Generally, taxpayers meet their burden of proof by having the information and receipts … for the expenses. You should keep adequate records to prove your expenses or have sufficient evidence that will support your own statement. You generally must have documentary evidence, such as receipts, canceled checks, or bills, to support your expenses."" 
In other words, the IRS is presumed to be correct unless the taxpayer ""produces ‘credible evidence’"" to counter the agency’s finding, said Timothy Jacobs, a partner specializing in tax law at the firm Hunton & Williams. 
It’s worth noting that as frustrating as this burden may be, the alternative is even worse, said Neil H. Buchanan, a law professor at George Washington University. ""If the IRS had the burden to produce evidence, it would have to be given access to individuals' private files, in order to find that evidence,"" he said. ""Is that what we really want the IRS to be doing?"" 
So, for the most common interactions with the IRS, the burden of proof is indeed on the taxpayer. 
The exceptions to the rule 
There are a few exceptions to this rule. The most notable, since the penalties are so severe, are for tax-related criminal cases and civil fraud cases. In these types of cases, the burden of proof is essentially the same as it is for any other criminal case: The government, not the taxpayer, has to prove their case. 
""If the government wants to convict you of murder, it has to show that you intentionally killed someone,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, a law professor at the University of Pennsylvania. And if the IRS takes you to court, he said, ""it has to show that you owe a certain amount of taxes and didn’t pay it."" 
Technically, Forbes was referring to the ""burden of production,"" which is the burden of providing supporting evidence, rather than the ""burden of proof,"" which typically refers to the burden of proving a case in court, Buchanan said. 
Still, the IRS uses the term ""burden of proof"" on the Web page that spells out what people have to provide to justify their deductions. 
So how common are the exceptions? Tax experts said criminal and civil-fraud cases are rare today when compared to ordinary tax-liability cases. ""Essentially all tax cases are normal, non-fraudulent adjustments,"" Weisbach said. 
This ratio of cases suggests that Forbes’ claim is largely accurate. ""Nothing the congressman said on the burden of proof would strike me as outside of the norm or the general rule if I or any other tax litigator heard it in everyday conversation,"" Jacobs said. 
Our ruling 
Forbes said ""the IRS doesn't have to prove something against you. They can walk in and you've got the burden of proof."" 
He’s correct for most tax disputes. As long as no criminal or fraud charges are being tried, and as long as the case is taken up administratively rather than in court, the burden of justifying a taxpayer’s calculations falls upon the taxpayer. But in the relatively small number of criminal or civil fraud cases, the burden is on the government, just as it is in other types of prosecutions. On balance, we rate Forbes’ claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/22/randy-forbes/randy-forbes-says-taxpayer-has-burden-proof-when-f/

Rick Scott says budget sets record low for state workers per capita this century
","
When Florida Gov. Rick Scott announced he approved a $74.1 billion budget, he portrayed it as having plenty of goodies for everyone, from school teacher raises to hot meals for the elderly. But he also claimed that the budget was lean. 
""This budget also reflects the smallest state government workforce per 1,000 residents in Florida in this century,"" Scott wrote in his May 20th veto and budget message. ""The Florida Families First budget is one of our state's smallest budgets this century, when adjusted for population growth and inflation."" 
PolitiFact Florida has separately tracked Scott's 2010 campaign progress to reduce the state workforce by 5 percent -- we rated that Promise Kept earlier this year. 
Here, we wanted to fact-check Scott's claim that the recently approved budget reflects the smallest state workforce in relation to population since 2000. 
Scott's data 
There are a few valid ways to measure the number of state workers. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics compiles data on actual state workers while the state Department of Management Services annual workforce reports show both established positions (including vacant ones) and actual employees (some folks refer to that as ‘heartbeats'.) 
But here, Scott's office of policy and budget created their own chart by pulling together budget data. We did not review the full backup that shows all the details that went into the chart but we interviewed spokespersons in Scott's office who explained their methodology to PolitiFact. Here is how they arrived at their figures: They started with the state's general appropriations budget each year, which does not include the state university workers. Then they made some adjustments to provide apples to apples comparisons: Scott subtracted for vetoes -- his own and by recent past governors -- and by subtracting county health workers, who were not included in state budgets before 2009-10. Scott's office also added in positions that were included in separate bills not reflected in the general budget bill. That's how Scott's office arrived at a figure of adjusted positions. 
Then Scott's office examined population data from the state's Office of Economic and Democratic Research. That data includes some projections so it sometimes has slightly different figures from the Census Bureau. 
Let's look at Scott's figures:

We spot-checked some of the math and the calculations were correct. 
The ratio declined before Scott, too 
Our task here is to fact-check whether Scott's claim about the declining state workers per capita was correct -- not whether or not that is the best policy or why the numbers declined. But we will briefly provide some background about the state workforce. 
First, we'll note that the ratio of Scott's adjusted positions compared to population has declined under not only Scott, but also his predecessors Charlie Crist (Republican turned independent while in office, and now a Democrat) and Jeb Bush (Republican). 
PolitiFact Florida fact-checked a claim by Alex Sink, Scott's Democratic opponent in 2010, who said at the time that ""Compared to other states, Florida ranks last in the ratio of employees to residents: 118 per 10,000 compared to the national average of 216 employees per 10,000 residents. And Florida is dead last in the nation in state employee payroll expenditures per resident: $38 compared to the national average of $69 per resident."" We rated Sink's claim True. 
(The National Conference of State Legislatures did not have an updated ranking to reflect Scott's tenure.) 
Since Scott took office, there have been about 60,000 staffers to leave because they quit, retired or for other reasons, and the state laid off 2,197 workers. (Those figures don't include state universities but do include temporary state workers who briefly work for the state.)   
One area Scott has targeted in the budget to save money is the state prisons. In January, his administration announced that it would outsource health care for more than 15,000 inmates including at prisons in Miami-Dade County. That has affected about 400 workers but about 97 percent were hired by the company, according to the state Department of Corrections. 
We sent Scott's claim to Chris Lafakis, a senior economist at Moody's who studies Florida. (He used BLS data to examine Scott's claim.) 
""He's right if you look at it in terms of state government workers per capita, but this is partially because of all the retirees that have flooded into the state. If you look at the state government share of total employment, it is low, but not at an all time low. .... This number has been steadily declining since the mid 1990s, and Scott has continued it on the downward trend,"" Lafakis told PolitiFact Florida in an email. 
We also interviewed two professors of public administration at Florida International University -- chair Howard A. Frank and assistant professor Hai (David) Guo. Both said that Scott's claim may not tell the full story about the state's workforce. 
Frank raised a question about how to factor in privatization efforts. 
""Ideology aside, those employees are less burdensome in terms of direct outlays, but I suspect at least some are ""quasi-governmental"" if they are employed by entities that derive a significant part of their revenue from the state-local sector,"" he wrote. 
Guo said that additional indicators of government size include the budget per capita and its growth and whether the state has shifted any responsibilities to local governments. 
""The employee number of state government alone may not tell the whole story,"" Guo wrote in an email. 
Our ruling 
Scott said that the 2013-14 budget ""reflects the smallest state government workforce per 1,000 residents in Florida in this century."" 
To get there, Scott's office examined budgeted positions and made certain adjustments including subtracting for vetoes. They also projected the state's population for 2013-14. 
We think their assessment is largely fair, with some small caveats. First, there are other ways to measure both the state workforce -- either by using federal labor statistics, or other state data. And second, the size of the state workforce per capita has been declining for years. 
Minor points, though. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/22/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-budget-sets-record-low-state-worke/

Rand Paul says Hillary Clinton was ‘asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi … including direct cables’

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., says Hillary Clinton is to blame for inadequate security in Benghazi, Libya, where four Americans died on Sept. 11, 2012. 
She was asked repeatedly as secretary of state to provide security, Paul told CNN State of the Union host Candy Crowley on May 19, 2013, including in ""direct cables."" 
Crowley asked Paul about his recent comments in Iowa and New Hampshire that Clinton’s failure should disqualify her from the presidency.

""Whether it has political overtones or not, it really goes to the heart of who you are as secretary of state if you do not provide security for an embassy that's begging for it, that's absolutely a dereliction of duty and she should have resigned and accepted blame for it.""

Paul’s office said Clinton’s name on diplomatic cables demonstrates she was involved in security decisions — or that she should have been. 
""It may be even more damning an indictment of Clinton if she is correct, because her disinterest in her job may have cost the lives of U.S. citizens overseas,"" said Moira Bagley, a Paul spokeswoman.   
She pointed to a claim from House Republicans, reported by the Los Angeles Times in April, that a cable signed by Clinton proposed security reductions in Benghazi before the attack. 
""Clinton's signature is on this cable and others,"" Bagley said. ""If Secretary Clinton signed a cable to reduce security, then her signature is strong evidence that she read cables."" 
(Bagley didn’t offer evidence that Clinton ""was asked repeatedly to provide security"" including ""direct cables."" But we’ll get there in a minute.) 
First, is Clinton’s ""signature"" strong evidence of her personal involvement? 
Let’s talk for a second about diplomatic cables. 
Think of them as messages sent via a new-fangled email system — dubbed ""CableExpress"" — that draws on some old-school customs. How old-school? The messages are also called ""telegrams."" 
The State Department’s Foreign Affairs Manual has all kinds of rules and instructions for drafting, formatting, addressing and sending these things. 
We browsed through several sections of the manual’s ""Correspondence Handbook,"" learning interesting tidbits such as, ""If you are sending a telegram from a Post to the Department or to another Post, enter respectively ""SECSTATE WASHDC""; or the telegraphic form of the other post (e.g. AMEMBASSY BERLIN, AMCONSUL CHIANG MAI) in the addressee field."" 
Here’s what we learned. 
If you’re sending a telegram ""to a post from the department"" — so, say, to a particular embassy from Washington, D.C. — you address it to the post, and it carries the name of the secretary of state. 
That’s right: The State Department’s communications center puts the secretary’s name ""on all telegrams to posts."" When Clinton was in charge, that meant the ""signature"" on telegrams was hers. 
That doesn’t mean she signed them — just that her name was printed at the bottom. 
That’s why, when Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif., argued on TV in April that Clinton had personally signed a cable about reducing U.S. security staff in Benghazi, Washington Post fact-checker Glenn Kessler, who covered the State Department for nine years, called it a ""whopper."" 
Rep. Elijah Cummings, D-Md., confirmed that assessment in May, saying, ""We have now seen this cable and she did not sign it. Her name is printed at the bottom just like tens of thousands of cables sent every year from the department."" 
But as we mentioned previously, Paul’s claim was about messages sent the other way, from a U.S. embassy to Washington. 
How are those addressed? To ""SECSTATE"" in ""WASHDC."" 
While a cable addressed to ""SECSTATE"" may look like a ""direct cable"" to the secretary of state, the reality is somewhat less exciting. ""SECSTATE,"" according to another part of the Foreign Affairs Manual, is the ""location indicator"" for the entire State Department, including the Peace Corps. 
About 1.4 million cables a year are addressed that way. 
Here’s how Clinton explained it to the House Foreign Affairs Committee in January: ""They are all addressed to me. They do not all come to me. They are reported through the bureaucracy."" 
She said security requests from Libya never came to her attention. 
""I was not aware of that going on,"" she said. ""It was not brought to my attention, but obviously it’s something we’re fixing and intend to put into place protocols and systems to make sure it doesn’t happen again."" 
Security requests 
So, Clinton’s name or title on millions of diplomatic cables doesn’t say much of anything about whether she personally knew of their contents. In the case of Benghazi security, she testified under oath that she didn’t. 
But it’s clear repeated requests were made to Washington. 
A report from the State Department’s Accountability Review Board in December 2012 noted that the number of diplomatic security staff in Benghazi the day of the attack was inadequate despite ""repeated requests … for additional staffing."" 
The board focused attention below the secretary of state, finding that ""certain senior State Department officials within two bureaus demonstrated a lack of proactive leadership and management ability in their responses to security concerns posed by Special Mission Benghazi, given the deteriorating threat environment and the lack of reliable host government protection."" 
But it didn’t find reasonable cause to determine that anyone breached his or her duty. 
House Republicans, critical of the review board’s focus on lower-level officials, released their own interim report in April. It says that in the months before the attack, officials from the U.S. mission in Libya stressed inadequate security and a need for more staff in ""numerous communications."" 
The Republicans' report mentions two cables and two email messages in particular, from March, April, June and July 2012, that reflect a back-and-forth in which diplomats requested more U.S. security personnel, but Washington officials said no. They preferred trained Libyan security staff. 
None of the messages involve Clinton — except that one of them bears her ""signature,"" as any cable out of Washington would. 
Still, some recent testimony before the House Oversight Committee suggested there’s some expectation she should have been familiar with the discussion. 
Eric Nordstrom, the State Department’s former regional security officer in Libya, drafted some of the cables from the embassy requesting additional security, including the one from March cited by Republicans. 
He testified before lawmakers on May 8, 2013, that he would have expected Clinton to have read or been briefed on that cable. 
""I certainly expected (that) given the fact that she had an involvement in the security process,"" he said. 
She would have had to personally approve Defense Department security teams that had been deployed, Nordstrom testified — teams that he requested in the March cable to keep. 
""She also came out to post, toured our facilities and toured the facilities and saw the lack of security there — that was something that her country team — or she was briefed by the country team as she visited the site,"" he said. 
Still, when lawmakers asked him if the State Department’s review board let anyone off the hook, he pointed to the undersecretary for management, Patrick Kennedy, rather than Clinton. 
""I think she has a very reasonable assertion some of these issues weren't brought to her attention,"" Nordstrom said. ""Well, how do we fix that so they are brought to the attention of the secretary of state? It is not lost on me that as the unheeded messenger this time around, I look at where those messages seem to stop, the undersecretary for management. ..."" 
""There is something apparently wrong with the process of how those security recommendations are raised to the secretary,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
Paul blamed Clinton for Benghazi security failures, saying she ""was asked repeatedly to provide security in Benghazi on several occasions, including direct cables."" 
The State Department was asked repeatedly for additional U.S. security staff in Libya. But we see no evidence that Clinton herself was made aware of those requests. For example, there’s no ""direct cable"" that automatically appears on the secretary of state’s desk. Instead, all cables would have carried her name, and only those passed up the chain by staff would have reached her. She says these ones didn’t. 
Meanwhile, the same security officer who testified that he would have expected her to be briefed on his request for more staff also said, ""there is something apparently wrong with the process of how those security recommendations are raised to the secretary."" 
Paul’s office didn’t provide evidence linking requests for security directly to Clinton. We found only evidence that requests were made of her department. We rate his statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/may/22/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-hillary-clinton-was-asked-repeatedl/

Rick Perry says Sam Houston opposed slavery and said Texas shouldn’t secede over it
","
As the Texas-headquartered Boy Scouts of America moved closer to a vote on allowing openly gay members, Texas Gov. Rick Perry revisited his opposition to such a change, while calling for leadership that hews to principles even when they are unpopular. 
Speaking May 6, 2013, via video as part of the national, conservative Family Research Council’s ""Stand With Scouts Sunday"" webcast, Perry cited the example of Sam Houston, Texas’ first president and seventh governor, whose portrait hung behind Perry on a wall in the Governor’s Mansion. 
""From this library that I speak, he made a powerful decision that cost him his governorship,"" Perry said. ""He was against slavery, and he stood up and very passionately said, you know, ‘Texas does not need to leave the Union over this issue of slavery. We need to stay. We’ve only been’ -- he thought, a terrible decision. He was right. But it cost him his governorship."" 
That’s ""the kind of principled leadership"" we need today, said Perry, a former Eagle Scout who wrote a 2008 book defending the organization’s ""American values"" and saying it was the object of an anti-religious ""cultural war"" being waged to force the inclusion of gays, agnostics and atheists. 
His comments touched off an Internet flurry of debate over whether opposing slavery could or should be equated with opposing gay admission, but we wondered about the underlying facts. Did Sam Houston, the leader of Texas’ military insurrection against Mexico, oppose slavery and say Texas shouldn’t split from the United States over it? 
Houston did lose his job as governor over secession, ending a career of representing Texans in elected office almost continuously from the Texas Revolution to the start of the Civil War. The military hero of San Jacinto became the first president of the Republic of Texas in 1836; then a representative in the Republic’s legislature; president a second time; U.S. senator when Texas became a state in 1845; and, finally, governor starting in 1859. 
But Texas’ secession convention removed Houston as governor March 18, 1861, after he refused to sign an oath of loyalty to the Confederate States of America. Historians have written that Houston’s views on secession had earlier cost him his seat in the U.S. Senate. 
As a senator, according to the Texas State Historical Association’s Handbook of Texas, Houston angered pro-slavery factions by voting in 1848 to prohibit slavery in Oregon; supporting the delicately balanced slavery/anti-slavery decisions in the Compromise of 1850; and opposing, in 1854, the Kansas-Nebraska Act that let territories decide their own slavery status, repealing previous law that banned slavery north of latitude 36°30'. 
What guided Houston’s thinking in these disputes was his belief in the ""glorious Union"" he had worked hard to get Texas into. The Handbook says, ""As senator, Houston emerged as an ardent Unionist ... a stand that made him an increasingly controversial figure. He stridently opposed the rising sectionalism of the antebellum period and delivered eloquent speeches on the issue."" 
Perry spokesman Josh Havens referred us to the 2004 biography ""Sam Houston,"" in which author James Haley described Houston the politician as treading a fine line on slavery for decades: ""He disliked it,"" Haley wrote, but ""recognized it as a fact of life to be dealt with."" 
Via email, Haley told us, ""Gov. Perry is right that Houston was against slavery, but as a Southern senator he was chained to it and could not openly oppose it."" 
Haley pointed us to a key speech by Houston on slavery, delivered Feb. 22, 1855, in Boston, in which the senator said the Union should not be sundered for ""political opinions,"" that slavery was natural to the Southern economy and that the North would still have slaves if it were profitable there. Emancipation, Houston said, would cast the freed man into jobless destitution: ""You might call him free, but he would be an object of want and wretchedness."" 
Haley wrote, ""To Sam Houston, what was paramount at that time, and in that place, and during that crisis was keeping the Union together."" 
Houston’s personal views on slavery are unclear. He was a slaveowner; according to his biography online at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, an inventory of his property upon his death in 1863 listed ""12 slaves valued at $10,530.20."" 
Yet ""almost all acts other than his ownership of slaves support the idea that he disagreed with slavery as an institution,"" the university biography said. Among examples given: ""While in office as president of the Republic of Texas and later as governor, he refused to permit payments to bounty hunters of escaped slaves. He also prohibited slave ships from trafficking in Texas."" 
One of Houston’s slaves recalled hearing him speak against the institution on the day Abraham Lincoln was elected president. In the 1940 memoir ""My Master,"" Jeff Hamilton said, ""I heard the General say that slavery was a damnable thing at best, and that he didn’t believe in human slavery nor in secession or disunion either. He said he hoped God might in some way perform a miracle as of old and save the country from destruction."" 
After Houston had helped shepherd Texas into the United States, he spoke publicly and often against ripping the Union apart over slavery. His pro-Union views and Senate votes made him anathema in Southern politics. 
His Senate career, the Handbook of Texas says, ""was effectively ended when, in 1855, the Texas Legislature officially condemned his position on the Kansas-Nebraska Act,"" which Houston opposed ""because it allowed the status of slavery to be determined by popular sovereignty, a concept he saw as potentially destabilizing to the nation."" 
Somewhat of a lame-duck senator, Houston returned to Texas and ran unsuccessfully for governor in 1857. Opponent Hardin Runnels advocated reopening the slave trade with Africa, which Houston had called an ""unholy and cruel traffic"" as Texas’ president. Houston was portrayed as a traitor to the South; the press accused him of ""voting against all bills in the interest of slavery,"" according to a July 1914 analysis in the Southwestern Historical Quarterly that summed up his defeat: ""The people had not yet forgiven Houston for his support of the Kansas-Nebraska bill."" 
Before leaving Washington for good, Houston defended his Kansas-Nebraska vote in March 19, 1858, remarks to the Senate: ""I was not the enemy of slavery, nor was I its propagandist, nor will I ever be."" 
Houston ran for governor again as a pro-slavery candidate, according to T.R. Fehrenbach’s 2000 ""Lone Star: A History Of Texas And The Texans"": 
In 1859, Houston, now past his sixty-fifth year, determined to appeal to the people once again. His platform was clear: he supported slavery, he supported the Constitution, but he pledged allegiance to the Union, come what may. It was not a popular platform, but Houston could not believe that the Texans were prepared to forsake the greater nation he had done so much to build. 

From the gubernatorial pulpit, Houston kept arguing against secession on practical grounds. 
In a Sept. 22, 1860, speech in Austin, Houston said slavery was not threatened if Southern states stayed in the Union: ""We still have the institution of slavery. All the legislation on the subject for the past twenty years has been to secure it to us, so long as we may want it."" 
Civil war would destroy the Southern states, he said, and there was no need for secession: ""Are our rights invaded and no government ready to protect them? No! Are our institutions wrested from us and others foreign to our taste forced upon us?  No!  … if the battle is to be fought for the Constitution, let us fight it in the Union and for the sake of the Union."" 
The institution of slavery ""is our own,"" Houston said, ""and the North has nothing to do with it. The North does not want it, and we have nothing to do with that. … We have the right to abolish slavery -- they have the right to establish it. It is in our interest to have it. Climate, soil, association -- all make the institution peculiarly suited to us. If it were to their interest, the people of the North would have it."" 
In a Nov. 14, 1860, open letter to residents of Huntsville who wrote to seek his advice on secession, Houston said a revolution should not be launched without ""some more weighty reason for overthrowing the Government, than rash enthusiasts have yet given."" 
As Texas moved toward secession, Houston told the Legislature in a Jan. 21, 1861, message that the slave states should be able to keep their rights, but ""hasty"" action could be disastrous for cash-strapped Texas. ""The millions now spent by the United States, the support of our postal service, the defense of our commerce, must all come from the pockets of our people."" 
Houston’s appeals failed, but Lincoln was impressed by his courage and according to the Texas State Library’s web site ""made secret contact with him through intermediaries, offering the old general command of 50,000 troops and the rank of major general if he would lead a force to restore federal control of Texas."" 
Houston turned down the offer in a March 29, 1861, letter; some accounts say he sat up late into the night discussing the question with friends in the mansion’s library and then dropped Lincoln’s offer into the fire. 
We asked Havens for reaction to our findings, and asked whether the Lincoln offer or another event was the ""powerful decision"" Perry had referred to. Haley’s book mentions a ""family tradition"" that says Houston paced the mansion’s floors all night before refusing to sign the Confederate oath. 
Havens said, ""Gov. Perry was referencing Gov. Houston’s strength of character, standing up for what he believed was right in the face of public opposition. There were a collection of events that occurred over that period of time, including burning Lincoln’s letter in the mansion library, when Houston was pondering an issue that would not only shape the fate of our state, but also his personal future."" 
Houston did not live to see the war’s end; he left Austin to return to Huntsville, where he died of pneumonia on July 26, 1863, at age 70.
  
Our ruling 
Perry said his long-ago predecessor ""was against slavery, and he stood up and very passionately said, you know, ‘Texas does not need to leave the Union over this issue of slavery.’ "" 
Houston’s personal views are unclear; politically, he took actions that were viewed as anti-slavery as well as actions that were pro-slavery. 
But he did exhort Southerners and his fellow Texans not to secede over slavery -- an unpopular stance he stuck to in hopes of preserving the Union he revered.

State senator says referendum on County Board allows voters to decide on cutting budget
","
After state Senate approval of a bill to greatly curtail the Milwaukee County Board, Republican backers scoffed at Democratic Party critics who said the legislation trampled on local control. 
One Milwaukee-area Republican, state Senator Leah Vukmir of Wauwatosa, said the accusation ""couldn’t be further from the truth."" 
""This measure is ultimately about local control and gives Milwaukee County taxpayers a choice,"" a Vukmir news release said May 15, 2013, a day after the 19-14 Senate vote. ""We are giving the citizens of the county the voice to say exactly how the county board will operate."" 
Specifically, Vukmir said the bill mandates an April 2014 referendum in which Milwaukee County voters will determine if the County Board’s budget is cut by two-thirds and board supervisors’ pay is cut in half. 
""If the referendum passes, supervisor pay would be reduced to around $24,000, health insurance and pension benefits would no longer exist and the county board budget would be reduced from $6 million to $2 million,"" her release said. ""The referendum gives the people the chance to decide..."" 
The referendum question on supervisors’ pay was familiar to us, but would voters also get the chance to decide whether the County Board’s budget falls by two thirds? 
The bill authored by Republican state Rep. Joe Sanfelippo changed as it worked its way from drafting through passage to the desk of Gov. Scott Walker, a former Milwaukee County executive who is expected to sign it. 
But the fundamentals haven’t changed since Sanfelippo unveiled his first draft in January 2013. 
From the get-go, the West Allis representative wanted voters to decide on trimming Milwaukee County supervisors' pay. The initial proposal was a cut from $50,679 to $15,000 a year. In the bill’s final version, the April 2014 referendum still deals with supervisors’ pay, but the pay cut is smaller -- about 50%, reducing the salary to about $24,000. The precise pay is tied to per-capita income in Milwaukee County. If voters approve the pay cut, supervisors would lose health and pension benefits. 
But a reading of the final bill shows that county voters will not be asked whether the County Board’s budget should be cut by two-thirds under a budget-capping formula outlined in the bill. 
There is no referendum on the budget cap, contrary to what Vukmir’s May 15 release stated. 
That’s been true since Sanfelippo first went public with a draft in mid-January. 
A Journal Sentinel story on his announcement was headlined: ""A $5 million cut to County Board budget won’t go before voters."" (The cut initially was larger than in the final bill; it’s now about $4 million). 
Bottom line: The bulk of the hoped-for $4 million savings annually in the County Board budget would be accomplished if Walker signs the legislation -- without voters weighing in. 
Similarly, without requiring voters to sign off, the bill requires supervisors to stand for election every two years instead of every four, and scales back the board’s role in contracts, land sales and labor negotiations, as the Journal Sentinel reported. 
Vukmir aide Jason Booth blamed confusion about the contents of the bill for the error on the scope of the referendum. 
Proponents of the bill, including current Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele and top Milwaukee business leaders, say it would restore authority to the county executive’s office and streamline county decision-making. 
Sanfelippo has claimed his bill puts Milwaukee County Board spending in line with other major counties. We rated that statement Mostly True. Sanfelippo, himself a former Milwaukee County Board member, thinks supervisors should be part-time citizen legislators starting in 2016. 
But others see the legislation as an anti-democratic power grab that will put too much power in the executive branch. 
""With the long history of Milwaukee County Executives abusing their power, this bill is a dangerous step in the wrong direction, Senate Democratic Leader Chris Larson, D-Milwaukee, said upon passage. ""Unfortunately, this bill flies in the face of the trust in the people of Milwaukee County and our Democratic system."" 
Our rating 
Vukmir contended that Milwaukee County voters would decide whether the County Board budget takes a big cut. 
That’s wrong. A referendum would determine County Board supervisors’ pay, but most of the changes in the bill -- including the County Board’s budget level -- would take effect directly through the legislation, without voter approval in 2014.

Commissioner makes case on Twitter for more solar projects in Georgia
","
Public Service Commissioner Tim Echols recently took a different approach to hear from Georgians -- a Twitter town hall meeting. 
Some of our most interesting fact-checking claims have come from the social media site that has an estimated 200 million users, so we were curious to see what Echols had to say. 
One statement involving job growth in a particular sector of Georgia’s economy caught our attention. 
""Nationwide, approximately 120K #solarjobs (more than coal miners), but in #GA we have about 1,700 solar jobs,"" he wrote. 
PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out whether Echols was right. Or was there some information that clouded his claim? 
The Public Service Commission oversees Georgia’s energy industry, among others. In recent years, the voices of those who believe solar energy should be more aggressively explored has grown and become more vocal in Georgia. 
Count Echols among those voices. 
""Solar is a peaking resource,"" Echols wrote in one recent Twitter post. 
Echols included a Web link in his tweet about the number of people employed in the solar industry. The link came from the Solar Foundation, which does research to educate and spread the gospel of solar energy. In November, the foundation released its third annual National Solar Jobs Census. The report was put together by the foundation, Cornell University and BW Research, a public opinion research firm that focuses on workforce development. 
The report says there are nearly 120,000 Americans directly employed by the solar industry. In Georgia, however, the tally was 800 jobs, less than half of what Echols said on Twitter. 
Echols told us via email that he made a mistake, and he posted a correction on his Twitter page the same day we contacted him. 
""CORRECTION from town hall,"" he wrote. ""Typo on #solarjobs in #ga - not 1,700, actually 800! room to grow!"" 
We reached out to a few other sources on this issue to see whether anyone else had verifiable data on solar energy jobs in Georgia. 
Georgia’s Labor Department does not have a specific jobs count because employment is confidential in the solar electric power generation industry, a spokeswoman told us. 
James Marlow, the founder and chief executive officer of Radiance Solar, a solar installation company in Atlanta, said the estimate of 1,700 jobs for Georgia may still be correct. 
""My estimate is that there are 135 to 150 solar companies or firms doing focused work in solar in Georgia,"" said Marlow, whose company has 12 full-time employees and 10 contractors. 
He said Georgia Power is adding workers to its solar workforce. He also mentioned some companies that specialize in solar energy and pointed out that there are accountants, attorneys and training companies. Combined, Marlow said, they ""make up a significant worker base."" 
Shan Arora, project manager at Southface, an Atlanta-based nonprofit company that promotes ways to make homes and businesses more energy-efficient, said it is difficult to accurately track how many people are employed in the solar industry in Georgia. 
Arora is working on a Georgia clean energy industries census that would include that statistic. It’s hard to track down some businesses and gather jobs data, he said. Southface has 150 solar industry companies mapped on its website. Its list includes some electricians, plumbers and builders that were not compiled by the foundation, he said. The foundation has some solar companies on its list that Arora said he was initially unaware of. He hopes to have the census ready by early 2014. 
""The solar industry is bigger than I thought it was,"" Arora said. ""To pinpoint how many jobs there are is very difficult."" 
Our conclusion: 
Echols wrote that there are about 120,000 solar energy jobs in the United States and 1,700 of them are in Georgia. The website he cited to come up with the Georgia number actually said the total was 800 jobs. Echols wrote a correction on Twitter after we noticed the discrepancy. Such estimates are hard. 
Since he apparently got the first part correct, but erred about Georgia, we rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/may/22/tim-echols/commissioner-makes-case-twitter-more-solar-project/

Bob Deuell says about 300 infants leave hospital every year with an unrecognized heart defect
","
State Sen. Bob Deuell, a Republican physician from Greenville, won Senate approval of a proposal that would have Texas join states that have a mandatory screening test for newborn Texans after telling colleagues: ""It is estimated that 300 babies a year are sent home from the hospital with an unrecognized congenital heart defect. It is the most common birth defect in America.""

Senators on May 13, 2013, agreed to name the proposed act after several infants who died young and sent the revised House Bill 740 back to the House, which later agreed with the changes and sent the final proposal to Gov. Rick Perry. 
The measure defines congenital heart disease as ""an abnormality in the structure or function of the heart that exists at birth, causes severe, life-threatening symptoms, and requires medical intervention within the first few hours, days, or months of life.""

We wondered about the number of U.S. babies sent home with such a defect unrecognized and if it is the country’s most common birth defect.

Deuell aide Scot Kibbe referred us to Kevin Cruser, chief of staff to Rep. Myra Crownover, the legislation’s primary author, who said information disseminated by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention supports the senator’s claim.

Cruser pointed out a CDC web page including a link to the abstract of a 2002 research paper gauging variations in the incidence of congenital heart disease based on reviewing 62 studies published after 1955. The CDC page says that about 18 of every 10,000 babies annually born in the United States have ""critical congenital heart defects,"" also known as critical congenital heart disease, usually requiring surgery or interventions involving a catheter in the first year of life. Such defects can potentially be detected, according to CDC, using a test that determines the amount of oxygen and the baby’s pulse rate; the Texas legislation would mandate it.

More from the CDC web page: ""Some babies born with a heart defect appear healthy at first and can be sent home with their families before their heart defect is detected. It is estimated that about 300 infants with an unrecognized"" congenital heart defect ""are discharged each year from newborn nurseries in the United States. These babies are at risk of having serious complications within the first few days or weeks of life and often require emergency care.""

The mention of 300 is accompanied by a footnote indicating it came from a 2007 research paper, which was based on a review of hospital discharge records for infants in New Jersey born from 1999 to 2004, with the purpose of identifying newborns who were sent home as normal newborns only to be admitted later with diagnoses of congenital heart defects, according to an online summary.

The study’s lead author was Tajwar Aamir, a physician then employed by the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services, whose spokeswoman, Donna Leusner, emailed us a copy. The researchers’ review of more than 670,000 births ultimately suggested that 47 babies--or some 7 per 100,000--had gone home from the hospital with what proved to be a delayed diagnosis of a critical congenital heart defect that might have been detected with the ""pulse oximetry"" test, though the study also said that on average, there were seven to eight newborns a year ""who met the case definition of delayed diagnosis of a critical"" congenital heart defect ""after medical chart review.""

In addition, the authors aired a higher figure for unrecognized heart defects: ""This study validates the estimate of 9 in 100,000 births on screening newborn infants for critical congenital heart defects as the number of newborns missed by fetal ultrasound and discharge examination that might be identified by a screening program,"" the researchers wrote.

""The average delay in diagnosis was approximately six weeks,"" the study says,  and about 40 percent of the infants ended up in the emergency room.

The study did not say that nationally, 300 newborns a year leave the hospital with undiagnosed heart defects, so we sought more expertise.

By email, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute told us through spokesman Curtis Carey that heart defects are the nation’s leading birth defect. And according to institute experts, who he did not identify, the 7-in-100,000 unrecognized heart defects identified in the New Jersey study would reasonably fuel the conclusion that nationally, about 280 babies go home each year with ""missed or delayed"" diagnoses of heart defects, though that ratio is likely low because the study may have underestimated the number of unrecognized conditions by reaching conclusions based on hospital paperwork alone.

In a telephone interview, Richard Olney, medical officer for CDC’s National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, said the 300 figure has been extrapolated from the New Jersey study, given that 4 million babies a year are born in the U.S.

Olney called the 300 figure a ""rough estimate,"" adding that researchers are trying to update the calculation based on data from more states.

Olney said the other part of the senator's statement--that heart defects are the No. 1 birth defect--holds up. Some 3 percent of U.S. babies are born with some kind of defect, he said, counting 1 percent of babies with a heart condition. ""We’re trying to find the causes. In many cases, we don’t really know the causes,"" Olney said.

Our ruling

Deuell said 300 babies a year ""are sent home from the hospital with an unrecognized congenital heart defect; it is the most common birth defect in America.""

The 300 figure lacks a bit of clarification; it draws loosely from a one-state study published in 2007. Also, additional research is in the works. But the No. 1 status of heart defects is confirmed by the federal government. We rate the statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/21/robert-deuell/bob-deuell-says-about-300-infants-leave-hospital-e/
