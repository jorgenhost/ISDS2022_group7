Trump no marksman when aiming at Chicago gun laws
","When professing his belief in protecting the Second Amendment, Donald Trump often has invoked Chicago as a place that proves gun regulation does not equate with reduced gun crime. He’s been making this claim longer than he’s been a candidate for president: The most stringent gun laws in the U.S. happen to be in Chicago - and look what is happening there! In his final debate with Hillary Clinton on Oct. 19, Trump repeated this statement: ""In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city."" For Chicago, 2016 has been a year of record gun violence. The pre-Halloween weekend was the deadliest of the year, with 17 people killed. ""There have been at least 638 homicides so far this year, 217 more than this time last year, the data show. At least 3,662 people have been shot in the city, 1,106 more than during the same period last year,"" the Chicago Tribune reported on Oct. 31. As of Aug. 30, Chicago had more homicides and shootings than New York and Los Angeles combined. But does Chicago really have what Trump calls ""the toughest gun laws in the United States?"" The Trump campaign didn’t respond to requests for documentation. So to find out, we’ll look at ""gun laws"" from two angles, possession and sentencing of gun offenders. Possession For two years, Chicago did have the toughest gun possession law in the country. In 1982, the city banned possession of handguns by civilians, joining Washington, D.C., in prohibiting handgun possession. But the U.S. Supreme Court’s 2008 District of Columbia vs. Heller decision ruled the D.C. law unconstitutional, making Chicago the lone holdout among major cities for handgun prohibition. (A handful of Chicago suburbs had enacted bans along with Chicago’s.) But the Heller decision paved the way for the 2010 McDonald vs. City of Chicago decision that extended the Heller decision -- which had overturned a law specific to the District of Columbia -- to states. That meant Chicago no longer could ban handgun possession. Chicagoans, however, still faced stricter gun laws than residents of other major cities because Illinois was alone among states in not allowing concealed carry of firearms. Illinois became the last state in the nation to adopt concealed carry in July 2013, eight months after the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the state’s ban on concealed carry was unconstitutional. With that, Chicago lost its status -- or its stigma, depending on your perspective -- of having the strictest gun possession laws in the United States. In comparably sized big cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco, the city administers the concealed-carry permitting process. In Illinois, the Illinois State Police processes applications, so it can be argued that Chicago has less autonomy in restricting concealed carry within its borders than do other cities. Illinois’ gun laws still are considered among the most restrictive when compared with other states. The Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which advocates for gun control, gives Illinois a B+ and ranks it No. 8 in the nation on its ""Smart Gun Laws"" report card. The group lauds Illinois for, among several rules, requiring firearm owners to obtain a Firearm Owners’ ID card that includes a background check and imposes a waiting period on firearm purchases. But it also knocks Illinois for not requiring registration of firearms, for its lack of restriction on the purchase of multiple firearms and for not allowing local jurisdictions to regulate firearms. In other words, Illinois could make its gun laws much more strict than they are. Violations Another way to interpret Trump’s statement is that Chicago’s gun laws are strict because they impose strict penalties on those who violate them. But here, too, Illinois falls short -- much to the chagrin of Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel. Emanuel has argued for years that sentencing guidelines for gun offenders in Illinois are too lenient. The Chicago street gang members who have propelled the city to the top of the gun violence list, Emanuel has said, face harsher punishment from their gang leaders for losing a gun than for getting arrested with one. ""Let me remind you what one admitted gangbanger said in 2012 to a reporter. This is what the gangbanger said: that his gun possession arrest was a joke. Gangbangers know how to manipulate the criminal justice system, and they know its weaknesses first-hand,"" Emanuel said in a major speech Sept. 22 to address public safety in the city amid public furor over the Laquan McDonald shooting. ""Our criminal justice system is fractured, and it is undermining Chicago’s neighborhoods."" A Chicago Sun-Times analysis a year earlier had found that gun sentences for Chicago offenders were more lenient than elsewhere: In Chicago, felons illegally possessing a gun typically get four years, the Sun-Times found — toward the low end of the state sentencing guidelines. And those are the sentences judges hand out, not the actual prison time. Most people convicted of these gun crimes serve less than half of their prison terms because of ""good time"" that inmates can get credit for under state law, in addition to credit for time held in the Cook County Jail while awaiting trial. New York, by comparison, has a mandatory minimum prison sentence of 3 1/2 years for simple gun possession. In 2013, Emanuel pushed unsuccessfully for the Illinois General Assembly to impose mandatory minimum sentences for gun crimes. The effort was blocked by lawmakers concerned that it would lead to increased incarceration of young blacks and Latinos. Our ruling Donald Trump said, ""In Chicago, which has the toughest gun laws in the United States, probably you could say by far, they have more gun violence than any other city."" Chicago once had very tough regulations against guns, but they’ve been considerably watered down after the Supreme Court ruled that cities can’t ban handguns. Additionally, the state at one time didn’t allow concealed carry, and now it does. Its rules for allowing concealed carry are more relaxed than in California or New York -- states that allow local jurisdictions to regulate concealed carry within their boundaries. Nor are penalties for violating gun laws in Illinois the toughest in the United States. Mandatory minimum sentences make New York state’s laws tougher than those in Illinois. Trump’s statement contains an element of truth -- Chicago leads the nation for number of gun-related crimes this year -- but it ignores the fact that a U.S. Supreme Court decision and a change in state law brought Chicago in line with other cities on handgun rules. We rate this statement Mostly False.    ",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A47C0>],/factchecks/2016/nov/03/donald-trump/trump-no-marksman-when-aiming-chicago-gun-laws/
"['Campaign Finance', 'Workers', 'Missouri', 'Eric  Greitens']","
Greitens connects unrelated facts on Koster right-to-work claim
","Missouri is the scene of the most expensive governor’s race in the nation. On Sept. 30, Democrat Chris Koster and Republican Eric Greitens faced off in a debate in Branson. Greitens challenged Koster on several of his policies and political history, claiming that Koster is a ""career politician"" who opposes right-to-work efforts because he has taken ""$8 million from union bosses."" This number seemed high, so we decided to check out the claim. We also wondered if Koster, as Greitens said, opposed right-to-work efforts because of union campaign donations. Following the money The Greitens campaign directed us to the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry’s ""Money Trail"" page. According to this page, as of Oct. 30, Koster had received $12.2 million from what the Chamber says falls under the ""unions"" category. Koster's top three union contributors each gave his campaign more than $1 million. The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), a public services employees union, was Koster's top contributor, topping out at $1,250,000. AFSCME was followed closely by the Eastern Missouri Laborers' Educational & Benevolent Fund at $1,091,739 and Jobs and Opportunity, a democratic leadership PAC, coming in at $1,001,432. By far, Koster has received more contributions from unions over all other candidates running for any Missouri offices this year. The next highest total of union donations for any Missouri candidate is Democratic candidate for attorney general Teresa Hensley, with $692,849.00. Greitens doesn't even appear on the union donations list.   On right-to-work Greitens also claimed Koster opposes right-to-work legislation. Right-to-work has been a hot-button topic for Missouri. Right-to-work laws essentially make it illegal to require employees to pay annual dues to a union. The decision to pass right-to-work laws are made on a state-by-state basis. So far, 26 states have passed right-to-work legislation. Missouri's Republican-majority legislature has passed right-to-work laws in the past, only to see them vetoed by Democratic Gov. Jay Nixon, who leaves office in January. Greitens supports right-to-work legislation. His website states, ""I believe we must have 'right-to-work' legislation to improve Missouri’s job climate."" Opposing right-to-work legislation is an important part of Koster's campaign. Koster and other Democrats have used the term ""right-to-work for less"" to support their argument that a right-to-work law in Missouri would lead to lower pay for workers due to weakened collective bargaining efforts — efforts they say are made possible by those required fees. On the other hand, it's Greitens' belief that ""right to work laws help the economy as a whole and union workers."" The Greitens campaign directed us toward some statistics from the Labor Bureau of Statistics and pointed us specifically to Indiana. According to our email correspondence with the Greitens campaign, ""Since Indiana passed Right to Work, it has gained 37,000 union jobs, while Missouri gained only 6,000."" Taking a look at this information alone would suggest a correlation between right-to-work and increased union employment. As of 2015, 10 percent of Indiana's employed workers were members of unions, and 11.3 percent of workers were represented by unions. In Missouri, those numbers were 8.8 percent and 9.8 percent, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. However, statistics for the median income growth from 2014-2015 comparing Missouri versus right-to-work states suggests support for Koster’s claim that right-to-work laws lead to lower salaries. According to the U.S. Census, growth in Missouri was 3.8 percent, while the average growth in right-to-work states was 3.2 percent. Because jobless rates vary so much from state to state, the role of right-to-work legislation in these numbers is difficult to assess. So Koster has received millions of dollars from unions, and he opposes right-to-work legislation. But Greitens' claim goes further and claims that Koster opposes that legislation because of the union donations. So is there any evidence that the donations affected Koster’s position on right-to-work? When we reached out to the Koster campaign, we received this response from David Turner, his campaign's communications director: ""I reject the premise of the question and the assertion that the Attorney General's policy positions are at all influenced by campaign donations. Going back to the start of his career, Attorney General Koster has long record of advocating for working people, even when he was a Republican."" Turner provided us with examples of Koster's advocacy ""for working people"" dating back to 2004. Included was a link to a Springfield News-Leader story published after Koster broke with the GOP and became a Democrat. The story states: ""The Republican Party's disregard of workers rights, Koster said, is one reason he left the party."" Our ruling Greitens said Koster received $8 million from unions and opposes right-to-work legislation. There is no doubt Koster opposes right-to-work laws. And Greitens actually understates the total amount of Koster’s labor donations. He has received more than $12 million from unions, according to the Missouri Chamber of Commerce and Industry. But there is no evidence his position against right-to-work is influenced by these donations. Greitens is taking two accurate talking points and putting them together in a misleading way.   We rate this claim to be Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809731F9C0>],/factchecks/2016/nov/03/eric-greitens/greitens-connects-unrelated-facts-koster-right-wor/
"['Energy', 'Florida Amendments', 'Florida', 'Consumers for Smart Solar']","
Amendment 1 promises to protect seniors, but measure offers no new regulations
","Organizers for a proposed constitutional amendment about electricity generated by solar power have told voters their proposal would safeguard consumers — especially seniors. Consumers for Smart Solar, the utility-backed group behind Amendment 1, has spent millions to promote the measure in commercials, mailers and web ads. ""Amendment 1 protects Florida seniors from scams and rip-offs,"" claimed one ad on YouTube Oct. 19, 2016. We wanted to know how the amendment would keep seniors from being targeted. When we shined a light on the measure, we found Amendment 1 doesn’t provide any new protections, for seniors or anyone else. Solar support Supporters of the Amendment 1 campaign say the constitutional change promotes solar while protecting consumers. Critics have derided the amendment, accusing organizers of obscuring their true, backdoor intention of helping established utilities control Florida’s solar market and punish electric consumers for using solar panels. So how does the amendment protect seniors, or anyone else? On its own, Amendment 1 doesn’t. All the wording says is that current consumer protections can remain in place. Along with saying people may still buy solar panels and install them, the measure reads (emphasis ours): ""State and local governments shall retain their abilities to protect consumer rights and public health, safety and welfare, and to ensure that consumers who do not choose to install solar are not required to subsidize the costs of backup power and electric grid access to those who do."" The second half concerns the future of net metering, in which solar customers sell excess electricity back to the utilities. Net metering is currently overseen by Florida Public Service Commission rules. But the first half essentially says the amendment will not preclude any current or future state law or regulation. No legal protections would change. ""This provision makes clear that regardless of what course Florida takes with solar energy now or in the future, government will not relinquish its responsibility to protect consumers,"" a Consumers for Smart Solar spokeswoman told us. The Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services didn’t give any examples when we asked them how solar customers may currently be protected. The attorney general’s office said consumers with specific problems can file a complaint with them under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. The office reviews each complaint for appropriate action. You may have noticed the amendment does not spell out special protection for seniors. But here’s where Consumers for Smart Solar’s argument comes in.   They cited an August 2016 letter to the Federal Trade Commission from Public Citizen, a left-leaning consumer advocacy group. The letter said Public Citizen hoped the FTC would consider new regulations on ""arrangements in which consumers lease their solar system from a corporate third-party."" Florida is one of five states that do not allow a property owner to have a third-party installer put solar panels on their roof and sell the power back to them. In those deals, customers sign a lease for a period of time, usually a number of years, agreeing to buy power from the solar company. Florida customers are still allowed to lease the panels themselves, as long as they don’t sell the excess electricity to anyone, such as a landlord selling power to tenants. Consumers for Smart Solar pointed to Arizona, where solar companies bilked older customers who didn’t fully understand their lease agreements. But it’s not clear how this applies to Florida, because those kinds of deals aren’t allowed in this state. State law makes it so that someone generating electricity with solar panels can’t sell it to anyone but utility companies. The net metering clause matters here, too, because third-party companies in other states depend on the money they would get from selling electricity to utilities. The amendment would conceivably make that business model unworkable, were third-party sales ever allowed. Florida's two largest utilities, Florida Power & Light and Duke Energy have said they want to see Florida's net metering law changed to impose new fees on customer-owned solar users. More than one legal expert told us it’s ambiguous at best to say Amendment 1 offers protections. That’s up to state and local officials, who already have laws and regulations in place. Seniors aren’t specifically mentioned anywhere in the amendment’s wording. ""The only defined user of electricity in the amendment is ‘consumer,’"" Stetson University law professor Lance Long said. ""I think it is misleading to suggest that it does have a particular concern for seniors. It seems more in the genre of ‘scare tactic’ rather than accurate information."" Our ruling Consumers for Smart Solar said, ""Amendment 1 protects Florida seniors from scams and rip-offs."" The amendment’s wording doesn’t mention seniors specifically, it only lets current consumer protection laws stand. That means the measure doesn’t preclude any protections, but it also doesn’t provide any. If there were no amendment at all, the effect on consumer laws and regulations would be the same. This talking point may lead many voters, especially seniors, to think the amendment somehow offers new safeguards for solar customers, but it doesn’t. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809719C7C0>],/factchecks/2016/nov/03/consumers-smart-solar/amendment-1-backers-promise-protections-seniors-of/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Families', 'Jobs', 'Workers', 'Mike Pence']","
Is Mike Pence right that 1 in 5 U.S. households don't have anyone working?
","On the campaign trail, Donald Trump has consistently criticized President Barack Obama’s stewardship of the economy. Trump’s running mate, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, echoed that theme during a campaign event in Cocoa Beach, Fla. ""Literally, nearly one in four Americans in their prime earning years isn't working,"" Pence said at the Oct. 31 event. ""You've got one in five American households have nobody under the same roof that's got a job."" We wondered whether Pence was right. We were able to find a statistic with roughly that figure, but it lacks important context. Pence’s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article, but we quickly found that several conservative websites all published similar articles last spring with headlines like, ""One In Five American Families Don’t Have A Single Person Working A Job."" We’ll set aside a technical distinction that will mostly irritate economists -- the difference between ""families,"" which is the unit used in the data cited by the websites, and the broader term ""households,"" which is the word Pence used. There are 81.4 million ""families"" in the United States, but there are 118.2 million ""households,"" mainly because only ""households"" include single-person living arrangements. Ultimately, the differences between the two measures was modest -- 19.7 percent of families without any workers, compared to 26.7 percent of households. If these percentages were all that mattered, then Pence would be correct. But what he said ignores that many of those households without a working member consist of senior citizens who are retired. And unless Pence intends to shoo Grandma and Grandpa out of their Barcaloungers and into the workplace, he’s using a statistic that inflates the weakness of the labor market for Americans in their prime working years. How big a concern is this? Looking in federal statistical databases, we couldn’t find what percentage of households consisted of senior citizens. However, we were able to reverse-engineer it. We’ve streamlined the math by making some assumptions, but experts tell us the underlying method is solid. We’ll use ""households"" as our metric here, because that’s the term Pence used. (Using ""families"" would produce similar results.) According to the U.S. Census Bureau chart below, there were roughly 30 million households headed by someone 65 or older in 2015. Presumably most of these included a spouse who was also 65 or older.  Meanwhile, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, only 19.5 percent of Americans 65 and over are in the labor force (that is, either working or looking for work). The flip side of this is that about 80 percent of Americans 65 and older are not in the labor force.  As a back-of-the-envelope calculation, you can multiply the 30 million 65-and-over households by 80 percent --  the likelihood that someone of that age is not in the labor force -- and come up with an estimate of 24 million senior-citizen households in which no one working. These 24 million retiree households account for the vast majority of the 31.7 million total households in which no one is working. Essentially, it leaves 7.7 million households where no one is working for a reason other than retirement. These 7.7 million households account for just 6.5 percent of the nation’s 118.2 million households. And 6.5 percent is quite a bit smaller than the 20 percent figure Pence cited. By our math, about two-thirds of Pence’s non-working households can be explained by retirement -- a demographic issue that no president can reverse -- rather than by a shortage of jobs. Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, cautioned that many households include someone who is 65 and older yet still working, and many households have someone younger than 65 who is either unable to work, due to disability, or who has chosen to go to school or stay home to raise children. ""It is valid for political candidates to point to the disappointing employment-to-population ratio of adults, especially for American men between 25 and 54,"" he said. ""But it is quite misleading to suggest there is something wrong with a country that makes it possible for adult students, disabled adults, and very aged adults to live comfortably and productively in families or households that do not contain a person working for pay."" Our ruling Pence said, ""One in five American households have nobody under the same roof that's got a job."" Pence has a point that, according to federal data, about one of every five families, and about one of every four households, does not include a worker. However, this glosses over the fact that a big majority of these households have no worker because they consist of senior citizens who have retired -- an entirely different policy concern than a weak labor market, and one whose demographic roots make it beyond the reach of the Obama administration. We rate Pence’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F75C40>],/factchecks/2016/nov/03/mike-pence/mike-pence-right-1-5-us-households-dont-have-anyon/

Did Russ Feingold Social Security votes raise taxes and try to give benefits to illegal immigrants?
","A Ron Johnson radio ad that criticizes opponent Russ Feingold begins by talking about the federal budget deficit, then turns to one of the most common attack themes in election campaigns: Social Security. The female narrator in the ad, which was released Oct. 10, 2016, says Johnson’s Democratic challenger ""voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors, he even tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants."" It’s a two-fer sort of claim, combining nearly identical attacks that Johnson has made separately elsewhere. For example, a TV ad by the Republican incumbent says Feingold ""voted to increase taxes on Social Security benefits."" https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/5e846588-f639-4bfd-b092-3704294314d4 And in the first debate of the Wisconsin Senate race, Johnson said Feingold ""voted to tax Social Security benefits"" and ""also voted to give Social Security benefits to people who come into this country illegally."" So, with the Nov. 8, 2016 election looming, let’s check the two parts of the claim from the radio ad. ""Voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors"" Johnson’s campaign cites Feingold’s yes vote in 1993 on President Bill Clinton’s 1994 federal budget. One provision in the budget raised income taxes on Social Security benefits for middle-class and affluent seniors. A vote for the massive federal budget, of course, is a vote for the overall taxing-and-spending plan. It doesn’t necessarily mean support for every one of the thousands of provisions in it. For example, when Johnson was accused of having ""supported a plan to cut benefits and raise the retirement age"" for Social Security, our rating was Mostly False. Part of the evidence cited was Johnson’s vote for a federal budget plan, not a proposal dealing solely with Social Security. In this case, there was a motion to remove the tax increase from the budget. Feingold voted to table the motion -- a vote that helped keep the increase in the budget. Republicans have also posted a video clip of Feingold speaking prior to his votes that indicated why he was not opposed to the tax increase. He said he probably would vote for the tax increase because it would be paid only by people who were earning enough money that they were already paying income taxes on their Social Security benefits. So, the vote was to raise taxes only on more affluent Social Security recipients, not all of them. ""Tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants"" Johnson’s campaign cites a Feingold vote on an amendment to the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006, saying Feingold voted against closing a loophole to ensure that illegal immigrants did not receive Social Security benefits. There was a motion to table the amendment and the motion was approved 50-49, with Feingold in the majority. In other words, the amendment failed. But we’ve already rated this part of the claim, when Johnson made it in the 2010 Feingold-Johnson campaign. Our rating was False. The amendment did not apply to illegal immigrants. It dealt with the policy on payments to formerly illegal workers -- undocumented workers who later were made legal. Illegal immigrants would not have been made eligible for Social Security benefits even if amendment had passed. Our rating Johnson says Feingold ""voted to raise taxes on Social Security benefits for seniors, he even tried to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants.""

On a proposal that would have removed a tax increase on Social Security benefits from the 1994 federal budget, Feingold voted no and indicated he was satisfied the increase applied only to higher-income senior citizens. The tax increase wasn’t imposed on all Social Security recipients. Feingold did not vote to give Social Security benefits to illegal immigrants. For a statement that has an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A48BB80>],/factchecks/2016/nov/03/ron-johnson/ron-johnson-russ-feingold-social-security-votes-ra/

Russ Feingold's attack on Donald Trump and Ron Johnson on abortion and domestic violence
","The tight Wisconsin U.S. Senate race has been marked by attacks made on GOP incumbent Ron Johnson and Democratic challenger Russ Feingold. (We’ve highlighted 20 of them.) But ahead of the Nov. 8, 2016 election, Johnson and his fellow Republicans are also trying to tie Feingold to the unpopular Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. And Feingold and other Democrats are trying to hitch Johnson to the equally unpopular GOP nominee, Donald Trump. A Feingold radio ad released Oct. 26, 2016 makes a number of claims about Johnson and Trump on women’s issues, including saying they both ""oppose a woman's right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act, denying protections to victims of domestic violence."" Let’s check both parts of the attack. Right to choose On abortion generally, Trump has been controversial. In Green Bay in March 2016, he said women should be punished for having an abortion. (Our In Context item fleshed out those remarks.) Then, hours later, Trump’s campaign posted a statement saying women are victims of abortion. When it comes more specifically to a woman’s right to choose, Trump went from pro-choice to anti-abortion, as our colleagues noted in rating True a claim by former GOP presidential candidate Carly Fiorina that Trump had ""changed his mind"" on abortion. As late as 2000, Trump wrote that he was pro-choice. But by 2011, he said he was anti-abortion, a position he has stated as recently as October 2016. Trump has said, including in his Green Bay remarks, that he supports exceptions for the life of the mother, incest and rape. Johnson is also anti-abortion. During his successful campaign to win Feingold’s seat in 2010, Johnson was asked if he Roe v. Wade was ""settled law."" He said the U.S. Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion  ""was a real tragedy,"" saying it ""usurped the democratic process."" In this race, Johnson was endorsed by Wisconsin Right to Life, which noted his support for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, a 2015 bill that would have generally banned abortion at 20 weeks and later. And Life News has urged support for Johnson, saying he has a ""strong pro-life voting record."" Feingold’s campaign also pointed out that in 2011, Johnson co-sponsored the Life at Conception Act, which declared ""that the right to life guaranteed by the Constitution is vested in each human being beginning at the moment of fertilization, cloning, and other moment at which an individual comes into being."" Johnson, however, has supported the three exceptions -- a position that drew some criticism from conservatives when he challenged Feingold in 2010. Violence Against Women Act The Violence Against Women Act was adopted in 1994. When it was reauthorized in 2005, it was set to expire in 2011. New reauthorization votes were taken in 2012 and 2013. In 2012, Johnson was among 31 Republican senators who voted no. The bill passed the Senate, but died in the House. In 2013, the bill passed the Senate again, with Johnson among 22 Senate Republicans to vote no. The measure then passed the House and was signed into law. Like the 1994 version, the renewed law makes it easier to prosecute crimes against women in federal court, and provides such services as domestic abuse hotlines and shelters for battered women. The new bill was also extended to women of Native American tribal lands who are attacked by non-tribal residents, as well as to immigrants, gays and lesbians. It’s worth noting why Johnson said he voted no. Johnson issued a statement after his 2012 vote, saying in part: I believe it’s critical to ensure that laws are in place to prevent and deter crime – against both women and men. Regrettably, the debate over the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act was completely politicized by the Senate Democratic leadership.

Republicans offered very reasonable alternatives to extend the Violence Against Women Act. Senate Democrats today defeated proposals to provide U.S. marshals the tools they need to track sex offenders across state lines. They voted against legislation to establish an interstate database for DNA evidence, to ensure sex offenders are brought to justice regardless or the jurisdiction in which they commit their crimes. And they rejected legislation to provide additional funds to allow law enforcement to pursue justice for hundreds of thousands of women. Johnson also issued a statement following his 2013 vote, saying in part: In passing the Violence Against Women Act, the Democrat-controlled Senate turned the renewal of a non-controversial piece of legislation that had a history of strong bipartisan support into a divisive and highly partisan bill.

As a result, the Senate has approved a piece of legislation that sounds nice, but which is fatally flawed. By including an unconstitutional expansion of tribal authority and introducing a bill before the Congressional Budget Office could review it to estimate its cost, Senate Democrats made it impossible for me to support a bill covering an issue I would like to address. Most analysts believe it would add more than $2 billion to the deficit.

I voted for an alternative that did not have these serious flaws. That alternative would help deter and prosecute violence against women – without the inclusion of unconstitutional provisions.

Our rating Feingold says Trump and Johnson ""oppose a woman’s right to choose and Johnson voted against the Violence Against Women Act."" Trump and Johnson are anti-abortion, though Trump in particular has said he supports exceptions to allow abortion in certain cases. Johnson did vote no on reauthorizing the violence law, but it’s not as though he opposed protections for women; in fact, he voted for alternative measures that did not pass.

Kander has in fact run for three different offices in the past eight years. He served two terms in the House, but could not run again because of term limits. After his time in the House, Kander was elected secretary of state in 2012, and announced his bid for U.S. Senate in February 2015. But what did Kander do during his time in the General Assembly? Kander served as a state representative from 2009 to 2012, and was a member of six different committees, including the budget committee. During both of his terms, the House was controlled by Republicans, making it difficult for Democrat-backed bills to make it out of committees and onto the floor. In fact, of the 28 bills Kander sponsored as a representative, only two passed in the House — House Bill 504 in 2009 and House Bill 238 in 2011. Neither were signed into law. Kander co-sponsored seven bills that were eventually signed by the governor.   ""As a member of the minority in the State House, the most effective way to have an impact on legislation is through partnering with Republicans and working hard at the committee level,"" said Anne Feldman, press secretary for Kander’s campaign. Kander focused much of his time in the House pushing for ethics reform. In 2010, he and Rep. Tim Flook, R-Liberty, passed a major ethics reform bill through the House — the first passed in Missouri since 1991. The bill made it through the Senate and was signed by Gov. Jay Nixon. However, in 2012, the Missouri Supreme Court struck down the bill, saying it was unconstitutional because the ethics provisions were tacked onto a bill dealing with purchasing provisions, two unrelated matters. Sponsorship versus co-sponsor The difference between sponsorship and co-sponsorship really depends on the bill. A bill’s sponsor is the representative who actually brings the bill to the floor. ""Usually, though not always, sponsors put a lot more effort into researching, drafting, and pushing through a bill,"" MU political science professor Marvin Overby said. Bills are either crafted by a sponsor and that legislator’s staff, or brought to sponsors by lobbyists or special interest groups. Bills can only have one sponsor, but can have an unlimited number of co-sponsors. A co-sponsor’s involvement in the lawmaking process can vary. For example, in passing the ethics reform bill, Kander partnered directly with Flook to craft the bill, showing as much involvement as a sponsor. On the other hand, lawmakers can co-sponsor bills ""as a cheap way of position-taking,"" Overby said. This is more common with non-original co-sponsors, when lawmakers sign onto a bill after it’s already been brought to the floor. Not an effective measure Measuring a lawmaker’s success by the number of sponsored bills they passed is pretty inaccurate in the long run. The percentage of bills passed is more telling than number, Overby said. ""More effective legislators usually concentrate more, putting effort into passing a few bills, rather than introducing a lot that have little chance of passage,"" he said. Being a Democrat in a Republican-controlled General Assembly didn’t make passing bills any easier for Kander. ""In majoritarian institutions, especially those with super-majorities like the Missouri legislature, it is very difficult to get minority-sponsored bills passed,"" Overby said. ""Bill passage rates is much more relevant for members of the majority."" Our ruling One Nation's mailer is misleading and cherry-picks Kander’s record. While none of his directly sponsored bills made it past the House floor, he was an active co-sponsor for ethics reform, and managed to get his bill through the Senate and to the governor’s office. While Kander co-sponsored seven bills that became law, no bill he directly sponsored was signed by the governor. But the statement ignores key facts to paint an incomplete picture. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2F31C0>],/factchecks/2016/nov/03/one-nation-pac/pac-oversimplifies-kanders-time-general-assembly/

Hillary Clinton says Donald Trump doesn't believe in equal pay
","With just a week before the election, Hillary Clinton reminded Florida voters that Donald Trump has been called out for ""demeaning, degrading, insulting, and assaulting women."" ""But I guess the bottom line is, he thinks belittling women makes him a bigger man. And I don't think there's a woman anywhere who doesn't know what that feels like,"" Clinton said in Dade City, one of her three stops in Florida on Nov. 1. ""We can stand up for what we believe, what we want for our children and our grandchildren, what we know is right. And you can go down the list of everything he has said,"" Clinton said of Trump. ""He doesn't believe in equal pay, he thinks pregnancy is an inconvenience, he won't raise the minimum wage, and he said if he comes home and dinner is not on the table, he gets angry."" That’s a long list. Here, we wanted to know if Trump has taken a position against equal pay. We found that Trump has said various things but at times has said he supports the concept that women and men should make equal pay. Equal pay We’ve detailed key issues about the gender wage gap in our PolitiFact Sheet, but a consistent argument is that women earn 77 cents on the dollar that men earn. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 makes it illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. The Institute for Policy Women’s Research says discrimination is a big factor for why the gender wage gap still persists. Experts consider ""occupational segregation"" another reason for the wage gap, which means women more often than men work in jobs that pay low and minimum wages. In her campaign website, Clinton says she will work to close the pay gap and to pass the Paycheck Fairness Act, a bill she introduced when she was a senator. Trump’s stance Trump’s campaign website does not include specific policies for how he would handle equal pay concerns if he was elected president. But his campaign refuted Clinton’s claim that Trump doesn’t believe in equal pay. ""We support equal pay for equal work and will enforce all statutes against discrimination,"" Trump’s campaign said in a statement. At the Republican National Convention in July, Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, said that at Trump Organization ""women are paid equally for the work that we do."" She said her father had made wage equality a practice at his company. ""He will fight for equal pay for equal work, and I will fight for this too, right alongside of him,"" Trump said. But before the convention, in January, the New York Times reported a former female Iowa field organizer filed a discrimination complaint, saying men at Trump’s campaign doing the same jobs were paid more and were permitted to plan and speak at rallies, but her requests were ignored. Trump told the New York Times the former organizer was a disgruntled employee and that his people told him ""she did a terrible job."" Factcheck.org in June noted Trump has likened equal pay legislation to socialism, and that performance, not gender, should determine compensation. On Nov. 19, 2015, Trump said: ""Here is the problem. If you start getting involved with government on ‘this one gets this pay and this one gets that pay,’ and then you say — ‘Where does it all start?’ Because you could have a woman that’s much better than a man, or you could have a woman that’s not as good as man, if you sort of say, ‘Everybody gets equal pay,’ you get away from the whole American Dream. You get away from capitalism in a sense. ""I can tell you, that I have women, honestly that are just, in many cases, they’re better than men, and I pay them more than men. And to a certain extent, people have to go out there, they have to fight for themselves. … I don’t know if people agree with me, once you get where everybody gets the same, I mean, you’re into a socialistic society."" In August 2015, Trump said on MSNBC's Morning Joe that if men and women do the same job, they should get the same pay, ""but it's very hard to say what is the same job."" Clinton’s campaign pointed to another August 2015 interview, in which CNN’s Chris Cuomo asked Trump if he would pass equal pay legislation. Trump said he was looking into it ""very strongly."" ""One of the problems you have is you get to have an economy where it's no longer free enterprise economy,"" Trump said. Trump said he favored the concept, but that it’s ""very complicated."" ""I feel strongly -- the concept of it, I love,"" Trump said. ""I just don't want it to be a negative, where everybody ends up making the same pay. That's not our system. You know, the world, everybody comes in to get a job, they make -- people aren't the same."" Our ruling Clinton said Trump ""doesn't believe in equal pay."" Trump’s campaign website does not have a stipulated stance on equal pay for men and women, but his campaign says he supports ""equal pay for equal work."" Trump has said men and women doing the same job should get the same pay, but it’s hard to determine what’s ""the same job,"" and that if everybody gets equal pay, ""you get away from capitalism in a sense."" Trump has also said pay should be based on performance, not gender -- so he does appear to favor uniform payment if performance is alike. Clinton’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

On average, Donald Trump comparison of health care, housing doesn't match data
","Health care was the theme of a Donald Trump rally Nov. 1 in Valley Forge, Pa., so it was not surprising that Trump focused on the projected price increases in policies offered under the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. ""People all across the country are devastated. In many instances, their health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent which, by the way, is a first in American history,"" Trump said. ""This is particularly unfair to millennials and younger Americans generally who will be totally crushed by these massive health care costs before they even get started on their journey through life."" We know health care costs have been going up relentlessly, even before Obamacare, and we also know that housing costs, which once made up about one quarter of a household's expenses, have been eating up a larger share of the family budget. So we wondered if Trump's characterization of the relative costs over time was accurate. The Trump campaign didn't get back to us when we asked for the source of the candidate's claim. So we asked some experts. Most pointed us to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' Consumer Expenditure Survey, which has been tracking Americans' expenses since 1984. That's the data we'll use. Housing costs made up 32.9 percent of annual expenses in 2015. Health care was just 7.8 percent. But it's more complicated than that. A lot of extra costs are packed into the housing costs — more than just mortgage and rent bills — and a lot of costs aren't included in the health care number. Here's how the numbers unpack. Housing Those annual housing costs, which average $18,409, include a lot more than mortgage payments and rent. They also fold in utilities, property taxes, repairs, furnishings, housekeeping supplies, appliances and equipment. The data don't list total mortgage bills. The BLS does list mortgage interest in charges, so for simplicity we'll focus on that. For people who own a house, the average yearly interest expense in 2015 was $8,169. (It gets a little complicated because the BLS number had to be adjusted for the fact that about 35 percent of households were made up of owners with a mortgage. In this analysis, we're not including people who own their homes outright.) For renters, who made up 38 percent of households, the average rent in 2015 was $10,005 per year, according to our adjusted BLS data. Health care Health care costs are even more complicated because many people get at least a portion of their health insurance paid by an employer or the government, and the BLS survey doesn't take that into consideration. If everyone were forced to buy their own health insurance, those costs would make up a lot more than 7.8 percent of the family budget. Nonetheless, the 7.8 percent spent per household on health care in 2015 represents a national average of $4,342 per year, $2,977 of which is spent on health insurance, $791 on medical services, $425 on drugs and $149 on medical supplies. Because Trump specifically referred to health care costs, rent and mortgage costs, here's the comparison for 2015: Health care: $4,342 Rent: $10,005 Mortgage interest (without principle): $8,169 So out-of-pocket health care costs are just 43 percent of when the average renter pays and 53 percent of what the average homeowner with a mortgage pays in interest. For recent home buyers and the self-insured under Obamacare, Dean Baker, co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic Policy and Research in Washington, said it's important to remember that while health costs have been rising, homeowners have been benefiting from ""the extraordinarily low mortgage interest rates of the last seven years."" ""A 30-year mortgage at 4 percent on $200,000 (80 percent of the median house price of $250,000) would cost around $11,500 a year,"" he said in an email. When it comes to health insurance, ""a family of four getting a silver plan without any subsidy would pay a bit over $11,000. If the mortgage rate was 5 percent, the annual cost of the mortgage (just interest and principle, no insurance or taxes) would be just under $13,000. If it was 6 percent, then the cost would be $14,400,"" so Obamacare would cost less. On the other hand, someone buying Obamacare now might find it far more expensive than the mortgage payment set up 20 years ago when housing prices were much lower. Historical trends Trump said this is ""a first in American history."" This, too, is incorrect. We took the BLS data and calculated the percentage of annual expenses for mortgage interest, rent and health care. Note that the first Obamacare plans sold through the insurance marketplaces took effect in 2014.  Out-of-pocket health care costs have been rising, according to the BLS data, but they're not close to converging, even though prices have been rising steadily as premiums have gone up, deductibles and co-pays have increased, and employers have shifted more of those rising costs to their workers. From a broader perspective, and one that includes government and employee costs for health care, data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis show that the United States is now spending significantly more on health care ($2.6 trillion in 2015) than on housing ($1.9 trillion). ""The aggregate health care consumption numbers have been higher than aggregate housing expenditures for a number of years now,"" said Jeffrey Clemens, a professor of health economics at the University of California San Diego. Our ruling Trump said, ""In many instances, (people's) health care costs are more than their mortgage costs or their rent, which, by the way, is a first in American history."" This is a bit of an apples-and-oranges comparison. He is comparing total health care costs but not total housing costs, looking at only mortgage and rental costs. To further complicate matters, per-person health care costs far more than what most households pay because many get their health insurance subsidized by employers or the government. With those caveats in mind, the federal data show Trump is, on average, incorrect. But the candidate fudged it a bit, and given individual circumstances it's certainly possible that some households are, in fact, seeing higher health care bills than what they're paying on their rent and mortgage. So we rate this claim Mostly False.https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4549f29a-a2e2-49dd-8fff-34d70628f2be",[<zip object at 0x000002809710A080>],/factchecks/2016/nov/02/donald-trump/average-donald-trump-comparison-health-care-housin/

Is Donald Trump right that in some states, you can cast an early ballot, take it back, vote again?
","Campaigning in Eau Claire, Wis., one week before election day, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump had a message for Wisconsinites who voted early for Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton but now regret it. ""Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake,"" Trump said in the Nov. 1, 2016 speech. Cast your ballot early, take it back and cast a new one? In Wisconsin, if you act quickly enough, you can do it, whether you voted in-person absentee or absentee by mail. The act is known as ""spoiling,"" something that has been permitted in Wisconsin for many years. ""It’s something that, prior to this year, very few people have done,"" Wisconsin Elections Commission spokesman Reid Magney told us. Of course, 2016 has been unlike most any other election year. And it also applies in reverse -- folks who voted early for Trump could take back their ballots, too. How spoiling works According to a Wisconsin Elections Commission news release issued on the same day of Trump’s speech: Once you have been issued a ballot, whether at the polling place, at the clerk’s office or by mail, you can ask to spoil your ballot as long as the ballot has not been cast and get a new one in the event you make a mistake or change your mind. When voting by mail, spoiling your ballot requires contacting the clerk’s office and requesting a new ballot be sent to you. The deadline for most voters to make that request is Nov. 3, 2016. Voters who have already mailed absentee ballots back to the municipal clerk’s office can go to the clerk’s office and make the request for a new ballot in person.  The deadline to request a new absentee ballot would the last day the clerk offers in-person absentee voting.  For most clerks, that is Nov. 4, 2016, but voters should contact their municipal clerk for scheduled hours. Absentee voters cannot spoil their ballot at their polling place on Election Day.  That was prohibited by a 2011 state law. Voters in at least three other states -- Michigan, Minnesota and Pennsylvania -- also accommodate early voter’s remorse, according to news articles in the past two days by the Washington Times, ABC News and Fox News. The National Conference of State Legislatures doesn’t have a list of states that allow re-casting a ballot. In some instances, it may come down to the discretion of a local election official, spokesman Mick Bullock said. Our rating Trump says: ""Wisconsin is one of several states where you can change your early ballot if you think you've made a mistake."" As long as you do it in time -- in Wisconsin, several days before election day -- you can ""spoil"" your original ballot and cast a new one. At least three other states allow re-voting, too.

Trump says Twitter, Google, Facebook buried Clinton emails story
","Have you heard the news that the FBI is looking into new emails related to Hillary Clinton? If you haven’t, Donald Trump says it may be because social media companies are suppressing the news. ""Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!"" the Republican presidential candidate tweeted Oct. 30. Wow, Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media! FBI Director James Comey sent a letter to Congress Oct. 28 that said the FBI may have found new emails relevant to its probe into the private email server that Clinton used while secretary of state. The FBI plans to review these new emails to see if they contain classified information. There’s no evidence to support Trump’s claim that Twitter, Google and Facebook buried this story in the first couple days after it broke. We reached out to the Trump campaign for its evidence and received no response. Sure, the FBI story come out on a Friday, so it competed on social media with users’ upcoming Halloween plans, the World Series and other events. But the topic was certainly popular. Twitter Twitter doesn’t have an algorithm to highlight or suppress stories, said Jen Golbeck, a University of Maryland professor and social networks expert. In their feeds, users see everything posted by the people they follow. If Trump was referring to Twitter’s ""moments"" feature, the FBI story appears on an accessible archived screenshot of the ""moments"" homepage the evening before he tweeted his claim.  The website Mashable took a screenshot of Twitter’s featured tweets, which Twitter displays when a logged-out user visits Twitter.com, around the time Trump tweeted. One of the top three featured tweets was about the FBI story.  According to the Twitter trend-tracking website Hashtagify, #ClintonEmails, #Comey, and #FBI surged in popularity over the past week, especially since the story broke.  Google Google can intentionally suppress topics by tweaking its algorithm, but the company denies that it does this in relation to the election. ""It would have to be an intentional choice, and that's a big deal,"" Golbeck said. In any case, it does not appear Google is doing that in this case. For example, over the weekend of Oct. 28-30, the FBI was the top trending Google search topic.   And CNN’s Brian Stelter took a screenshot of Google News in the minutes after Trump tweeted his claim, and the FBI story was at the top of the list.  Facebook Facebook is a bit harder to pin down. It does have the ability to suppress or highlight stories by altering its algorithm, though no one has produced evidence that this is something Facebook did with the FBI story. Further, Facebook tailors its trending topics based on the particular user’s interests. So the FBI story may not have appeared in one person’s trending topics bar, while appearing in another’s. While these companies probably don’t suppress certain stories, it’s hard to disprove a claim like Trump’s beyond a shadow of a doubt because there are so many ways social media sites could manipulate content visibility, said Kjerstin Thorson, a communications professor at Michigan State University.   ""Did it appear on people’s trending box space on Facebook? How long was it there? Was it trending only for some people and not for others? Was the story made visible in people’s Facebook news feeds or Twitter streams or in Google search results, via each platform’s display algorithm?"" Thorson said.  ""Outside of internal company data, there is no source I know of who could check that."" Our ruling Trump said, ""Twitter, Google and Facebook are burying the FBI criminal investigation of Clinton. Very dishonest media!"" Trump has not produced any evidence whatsoever to back up his claim, nor has anyone else. We found nothing to support the idea that the three tech and social media companies reduced the visibility of the latest developments in the Clinton email controversy. The burden is on Trump to produce information to support his statement. He’s offered none. Meanwhile, we’ve found plenty of evidence to contradict Trump’s claim.

Greitens misses bigger picture on Koster's domestic violence vote
","In a September press release, Eric Greitens, Missouri’s Republican candidate for governor, said his opponent, Missouri Attorney General Chris Koster, voted against legislation protecting women from sexual assault and domestic violence. Greitens said Koster voted against a 2007 bill mandating that the state pay for ""rape kit"" medical exams, not the victim of the assault. Koster was a state senator at the time the bill was proposed."" Chris Koster is always quick to tout his ‘experience.’ But he is totally silent about his record on issues related to sex crimes and violence against women, probably because it is so bad,"" the release reads. It continues: ""He opposed protecting the women of Missouri."" We wanted to know more about Koster’s stance on the bill, so we decided to investigate Greitens’ claim. More about the bill The legislation, House Bill 583, became law. Besides mandating that the state paid for rape kits, the bill also classified repeated instances of first-degree domestic assault as a Class A felony and established a designated address for sexual assault victims in order to protect their privacy. Greitens is right — Koster was one of four senators who voted against the bill. The Senate passed it with a vote of 29-4. It passed in the House 133-19. But Greitens’ release doesn’t provide the full story. We reached out to Koster’s campaign, who sent us a statement about why Koster opposed the bill. ""The idea Attorney General Koster wants rape victims to pay for their own rape kits is beyond ludicrous,"" the statement read. ""This bill contained a blanket provision that could allow convicted murderers whose trials occurred decades earlier to get out of prison, based on potentially manufactured evidence. He couldn't support that and for that reason opposed the bill,"" the Koster campaign said. The bill allows the Department of Corrections to grant parole to inmates serving time in prison for murdering their spouse or ""domestic partner"" if the inmate can prove that he or she was the victim of repeated domestic violence. To get parole, the inmate must provide evidence of domestic violence, and that evidence could not have been used in the original trial. According to the bill, the evidence could include ""witness statements, hospital records, social services records, and law enforcement records."" The provision allows parole only if the inmate has served 15 years of his or her sentence. The parole board must determine that the prisoner will not break the law again. The inmate’s trial had to have begun before 1991, and the homicide has to have been the person’s first violent felony conviction. Koster’s campaign staff said Koster objected to witness statements being used as evidence of domestic abuse leading to the murder. Koster’s position was that under the wording of the bill, the parole board and not the original jury would decide the prisoner’s fate on the basis of the witness statements. ""The bill doesn't provide a standard where the parole board weights (sic) the evidence, i.e. preponderance or without a reasonable doubt. This opens the door to manufactured evidence that would not be weighed by a jury,"" his campaign said. The Missouri Coalition Against Domestic and Sexual Violence supported the bill when it was in the legislature, said Colleen Coble, the coalition’s CEO. Coble said the bill’s aim was to allow imprisoned women who killed their partners following an act of domestic violence to have their cases reviewed by the parole board. Before 1991, evidence of domestic violence was not commonly presented as a defense in court, she said. Coble said Koster was supportive of the bill’s other provisions, including the measure to have the state pay for medical exams. Koster’s voting record We wanted to find out more about how Koster voted on other legislation related to sexual violence when he was a state senator. Koster’s staff provided us with more information. As attorney general, Koster assembled the Domestic Violence Task Force in 2010. The task force suggested 12 changes to Missouri’s domestic violence laws in a 2011 report to the Missouri General Assembly. One of the recommendations was to create more consistent definitions of ""domestic violence,"" ""abuse,"" ""adult,"" ""family"" and ""household member.""Some of the suggestions were folded into a Senate bill that became law that year. As a state senator, Koster sponsored several bills related to sexual assault, though none became law. In 2006, he sponsored a bill that would increase penalties for sexual offenders who fail to register. That year, he also sponsored a bill that would have required lifetime probation for first-time sex offenders. In 2007, he sponsored a bill that would allow victims of sexual assault to register a designated address with the Missouri Secretary of State’s office to protect their privacy. That was one of the provisions of the bill Greitens referenced. He also sponsored a bill that year requiring people convicted of felonies to serve a minimum of three years in prison if they failed to register as a sex offender at the time of their crime as required. Our ruling Greitens says Koster voted against a 2007 bill requiring the state to pay for rape victims’ medical exams. In reality, the bill did more than that. Koster says he objected to wording that made it possible for convicted murderers to be granted parole by claiming they were victims of domestic abuse. Koster said the language made it possible for murderers to manufacture evidence to be released before the completion of their sentence. Greitens is cherry-picking one part of the legislation to paint his opponent as soft on domestic abuse.

Greitens campaign misses mark with Backpage attack
","In the most expensive gubernatorial race in the country, Eric Greitens and Chris Koster have taken turns flinging mud at each other. Leading up to a Sept. 30 debate in Branson, Missouri, the candidates focused their efforts on who could advocate better on behalf of Missouri women. On Sept. 29, the Greitens campaign put out a news release explaining why they think Koster is ""wrong for women."" The release claims that Koster ""fell silent"" on investigating the website Backpage.com in 2011, after receiving ""over $12,000 in campaign contributions"" from a legal and lobbying firm representing the site, SNR Denton. That’s a pretty heavy charge. We decided to look into the claim. Backpage, a free classifieds website, has been criticized for promoting prostitution and helping facilitate human trafficking. The company’s CEO, Carl Ferrer, was arrested Oct. 6 for pimping a minor. In 2010, Koster and other attorneys general were trying to get the site to remove its adult services page. Backpage has yet to comply. According to the campaign release, Koster ceased any efforts against Backpage following donations from SNR Denton. We reached out to both the Greitens campaign and Koster’s press secretary to compare their versions of the story. Battling Backpage Much like Craigslist, Backpage lets users buy and sell items and services online. Unlike Craigslist, which removed adult services in 2010, Backpage still has an adult services section. Before getting into campaign finance, it’s important to understand the timeline of Koster’s work against Backpage, and how that timeline is described by each campaign. Starting in 2009, Koster and a growing group of attorneys general began attacking Backpage for allowing advertisements that promoted human trafficking, particularly of minors — both campaigns agree on that. Koster was one of the lead attorneys in a multistate working group trying to get Backpage to shut down its adult services advertising section in September 2010. Spokespersons from both the Greitens campaign and Koster’s office provided news releases to back that up. In August 2011, Koster and 44 other attorneys general sent another letter to Backpage, asking for proof the website was actively working to remove sex trafficking advertisements. Both campaigns cited that letter as well. And that’s where the timelines diverge. According to Greitens ""Then suddenly, (Koster) fell silent."" That’s what the Greitens press release says, at least. The release goes on to cite Koster’s 2011 campaign finance records. On Sept. 1, 2011, the day after the attorneys general requested information on Backpage’s efforts to end sex trafficking, Missourians for Koster received two donations. The first was a $5,000 donation from SNR Denton, a now-dissolved legal and lobbying firm that represented Backpage at the time. The second was a $250 donation from Samuel Fifer, a lawyer with the firm, who also counseled Backpage during the investigation by the attorneys general. Missourians for Koster also received two other donations from SNR Denton in 2012, which the Greitens campaign also referenced. ""Campaign cash is worth more to Koster than protecting Missouri’s children,"" the release goes on to say. That’s where the press release timeline ends. But we reached out to the Greitens campaign, and staffers pointed out one more piece of Koster’s involvement in investigating Backpage. In June 2013, Koster and two other attorneys general sent a letter to attorneys general nationwide. The letter asked attorneys general to sign on to a letter urging Congress to amend the Communications Decency Act of 1996. The Greitens campaign referenced this letter in its research sent to PolitiFact. The proposed amendment, known as the SAVE Act, would close the loophole that makes it easy for websites like Backpage to promote sex trafficking, giving state and local law enforcement jurisdiction over cyber crimes. The actual letter was sent to Congress that July, signed by Koster and 48 other attorneys general. Koster’s office referenced this letter. So, does sending a letter to Congress count as working to end human trafficking? Not if you ask the Greitens campaign. ""That’s the problem with career politicians like Chris Koster,"" Greitens campaign manager Austin Chambers told the Springfield News-Leader. ""They think sending a letter and a press release counts for doing something."" According to Koster But if you ask the attorney general’s office, Koster wasn’t finished with Backpage in 2013. On Oct. 15, 2014, Koster and the National Association of Attorneys General sent a letter to Congress asking for passage of the Amy and Vicky Act, which would make anyone involved in the sale or distribution of child pornography liable for restitution. Five days later, Koster and other attorneys general once again asked Congress to pass the SAVE Act, rehashing the sentiment of the June 2013 letter given to us by both Koster and Greitens. The letter, given to us by Koster’s press secretary, directly mentions Backpage. At the state level, in May, Koster’s office announced tuition-free training for prosecutors and members of law enforcement on how to effectively investigate human trafficking. Dirty money? But the question still stands: Did Chris Koster abandon efforts to restrict Backpage as a broker of sexual services as the Greitens’s campaign claims? It’s impossible to tell whether the donations caused Koster to ease up on his investigation into Backpage. However, Koster’s office provided us with evidence of continued activity against Backpage, even after the 2011 donations cited by the Greitens campaign. It’s also perfectly legal for lobbying firms to donate to campaigns, said James Klahr, executive director of the Missouri Ethics Commission. Klahr said the commission hasn’t analyzed how often or why lobbying firms make contributions, but a quick donor search shows SNR Denton and its employees donated consistently to Missouri campaigns since 2010. Even after merging into the multinational firm Dentons, the company continued political contributions. Dentons represents a long list of corporations. The firm isn’t exclusive to Koster. In fact, Dentons has donated to Greitens’s charity, The Mission Continues, since at least 2013. Koster has not had any ethics complaints related to donations from the firm, and Greitens can’t file a complaint, because the contributions were made more than two years ago, beyond the statute of limitations for ethics complaints. But, this isn’t Koster’s first time getting tangled in legal and lobbyist firm meddling. A 2014 investigation by The New York Times found that in 2013, successful lobbying by the law firm representing 5-Hour Energy led to Koster ending an investigation into false advertising by the company. Such practice is common for attorneys general across the country, the investigation found. However, one month after the Times article, Koster’s campaign decided to stop receiving contributions from lobbyistsconnected to anyone involved in litigation with the attorney general’s office. According to campaign spokesman David Turner, the campaign returned more than $115,000 since implementing the policy. Koster’s campaign did not receive any contributions from Dentons after 2014. Our rating Greitens said Koster ""fell silent"" as attorney general in pursuing a case against a free classified service accused of promoting prostitution after accepting ""over $12,000 in campaign contributions"" from people affiliated with the service. A lobbying firm that represents the classified service, SNR Denton, and its employees contributed to Koster’s campaign. Koster’s office didn’t end its efforts to restrict Backpage after the donations were made. Greitens’ campaign says Koster’s efforts were hollow. But that’s up for interpretation. The statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the statement Mostly False.

"['Oregon', 'Stimulus', 'Transportation', 'Peter DeFazio']","
Did transportation projects create more than one-third of all stimulus jobs?
","

U.S. Rep. Peter DeFazio didn’t care for President Barack Obama’s stimulus package in 2009 -- he said it contained too many tax cuts -- but Oregon’s 4th District congressman likes what it did for transportation. Or rather, what transportation did for the stimulus.

In a guest column posted on The Hill’s Congress Blog, DeFazio wrote that if more stimulus money had gone to transportation, more Americans would have jobs: ""Even 2009’s stimulus legislation was proof that transportation investment, no matter how minimal, creates jobs. Only seven percent of that bill was dedicated toward transportation projects, yet it created over one-third of the bill’s total jobs.""

A relatively small investment yields more than a third of jobs? That’s a compelling argument, and we wanted to know if DeFazio was right. We had two facts to verify: Did transportation take up a mere 7 percent of the stimulus package and, more importantly, did it provide one-third of the jobs created by that package?

Congress approved the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 in February of that year. It distributed $787 billion through a mix of tax cuts and benefits; money for federal contracts; and money to states. Last year, the $787 billion estimate was increased to $840 billion.

The stimulus is so ripe for fact checks that PolitiFact has nine pages devoted to stimulus-related statements. Here’s a great one from House Speaker John Boehner from July 2009: ""In Wisconsin, the stimulus paid for a bridge to a bar called Rusty's Backwater Saloon. They've got great burgers, but no new jobs."" (That earned a Mostly False.)

The U.S. Department of Transportation received $48 billion of the money, or roughly 6 percent. That’s lower than the 7 percent DeFazio cited so we find it close enough to be accurate.

Jobs created or sustained is trickier. PolitiFact has ruled in the past that it’s not accurate to say that no jobs were created by the stimulus, but that it’s not entirely fair for politicians to count as fact the high end of job estimates put out by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

PolitiFact Oregon checked five sources to see if any backed up DeFazio’s claim that transportation projects resulted in more than one-third of the jobs:

Recovery.gov: The recovery act’s website tracks stimulus spending and breaks it down by agency and subject. Every quarter it reports on self-reported jobs funded by the stimulus for that time period, but it doesn’t track the total number of jobs created. What we can do is pick a snapshot in time to see how many of jobs came from Transportation.

In the fourth quarter of 2011, for example, Transportation accounted for 26,000 of 204,000 full-time-equivalent jobs funded. That’s 13 percent, not anywhere close to one-third. In fact, we checked every quarter and found transportation agency projects accounted for anywhere from 5 percent of jobs reported for that period, to a high of 13 percent. This does not back up DeFazio’s claim.

Congressional Budget Office: The nonpartisan office issues a quarterly report on the broader effects of the stimulus on employment and economic output, but it doesn’t filter by agency. Its latest report issued last month shows the stimulus in the last quarter of 2011 increased the number of people employed by between 300,000 and 2.0 million. This, too, does not validate DeFazio’s claim.

U.S. Department of Transportation: You’d think that the agency itself would have jobs figures related to stimulus spending and how it compares. It does not.

U.S. Government Accountability Office: The office audits numbers as reported to the Recovery Act. A June 201 report on transportation infrastructure finds transportation projects supported between 31,460 and 65,110 full-time-equivalent positions each quarter from October 2009 through March 2011. But again, that’s not a cumulative figure. It’s just a snapshot of each quarter, as we did above.

The White House Council of Economic Advisers: Also every quarter, the council issues a report on the effect of the stimulus. It’s most recent report ""estimates that as of the second quarter of 2011, the ARRA has raised employment relative to what it otherwise would have been by between 2.2 and 4.2 million."" Still, there’s no breakdown by agency so no evidence for DeFazio’s jobs claim.

Just how does DeFazio back up his claim? Two ways.

First, his office points to various reports by the Congressional Budget Office and the Council of Economic Advisers that the stimulus has created about 3 million jobs. (Readers should take those figures with caveats, but there are private studies to back up the magnitude of 3 million, as included in the latest CEA report.)

Second, his office provided a link to a report prepared by House Democratic Transportation staff in which they used a multiplier to conclude that $64 billion of transportation and infrastructure investment ""will create or sustain more than 1.8 million jobs."" How did they get that figure? By using a 2007 Federal Highway Administration formula that links every $1 billion in federal spending to 34,779 jobs, direct and indirect.

We’re not even going to get into the fact that DeFazio lumped together transportation and infrastructure spending. He’s pulled a multiplier projection and attached that to a high-end jobs estimate to conclude that transportation and infrastructure jobs account for one-third of all stimulus jobs. Using this methodology, you could just as easily claim that the projects accounted for two-thirds of all jobs.

We find no other authority to back up the claim that transportation stimulus spending ""created over one-third of the bill’s total jobs."" Not the U.S. Department of Transportation, Congressional Budget Office, White House Council of Economic Advisers, Government Accountability Office or the people who tally the job reports for the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. We won’t even get into the argument of jobs created or sustained.

Asked to respond to our findings, DeFazio provided a statement saying that unemployment would have been lower had more of the stimulus focused on transportation and infrastructure projects.

""My point is pretty clear in the op-ed. Transportation investments have a proven high rate of return when it comes to job creation. The stimulus highlighted the difference between transportation infrastructure investments and consumptive tax cuts.""

We will grant the statement contains a smidgen of truth -- he has a report that projects 1.8 million jobs created or sustained, using a multiplier -- but it ignores critical facts that show otherwise. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968BD5C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/23/peter-defazio/did-transportation-projects-create-more-one-third-/

Reince Priebus says health care law could mean 'as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance'
","
Republicans marked the two-year anniversary of President Barack Obama’s health care law with statements and video ads attacking the law. RNC chairman Reince Priebus took aim with an op-ed in the Orlando Sentinel.

Priebus pointed to what he saw as a range of problems with the law, but we zeroed in on one claim. ""While millions will be added to the government rolls, millions more will also lose their current health-care coverage,"" Priebus wrote, later explaining, ""According to the (Congressional Budget Office), as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare.""

Is the health care law really going to leave 20 million American workers without health insurance from their employers?

We should note that PolitiFact does not fact-check predictions. However, we do fact-check whether politicians or pundits accurately portray the predictions made by others, particularly ones that carry a great deal of credibility, like CBO. So that’s what we’ll do in this case.

First, we should explain that the law is being phased in and that only a few provisions have already taken effect. The major elements of the law, which require individuals to obtain coverage and state exchanges for the self-employed and workers from small businesses to get insurance, won’t take effect until 2014.

Also, it's important to understand that the CBO and other independent groups project the law will result in new coverage for millions of people who are now uninsured. The numbers vary, but the CBO has projected that the number of uninsured Americans will be 29 million to 31 million lower than it would otherwise be without the law.

The law will cause some shifting around of how people get their insurance, and that is at the root of Priebus's point.

When we asked the RNC to back up its number, a spokeswoman pointed us to a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office. We often cite CBO’s research because we consider their work to be independent, nonpartisan and credible. We wondered whether Priebus had used CBO’s figure appropriately, and with sufficient context.

The CBO study in question was undertaken to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer. It took up this task with care, noting that surveys of what companies may do in the future about health care ""have no consequences for the responders, do not require careful analysis or extensive deliberations, and are necessarily based on limited information about the various ways that the (law) will affect the market for health insurance.""

Still, after taking into account the various cross-cutting factors, CBO came up with a ""baseline"" estimate -- essentially, its best guess. CBO, along with the similarly nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation, settled on a range of 3 million to 5 million fewer people, on net, obtaining coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed.

While 3 million to 5 million people is nothing to sneeze at, it’s also quite a bit lower than the 20 million figure Priebus cited. So where did the 20 million number come from?

CBO supplemented its ""baseline"" estimate with four alternative scenarios, tweaking its model in a variety of ways to account for the possibility that companies or individuals will behave differently than the baseline estimate assumed.

The four alternative scenarios produced a wide range of outcomes. One actually resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The other scenarios resulted in a decline of 10 million, a decline of 12 million, and -- here it is -- a decline of 20 million.

So Priebus is right that CBO estimated that ""as many as 20 million Americans could lose their employer-based insurance thanks to Obamacare."" But this is the most extreme outcome of five possible outcomes presented, and it’s not the primary estimate, which is about 5 million, or one-quarter the number Priebus offered.

So Priebus has engaged in cherry-picking. He also ignores some important context.

It’s important to note that not everyone who ""loses"" their employer coverage will do so involuntarily. According to CBO’s ""baseline"" estimates, 3 million people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance ""exchanges"" created under the Obama health care law -- virtual marketplaces for each state where applicants will be able to compare and purchase plans that offer at least a minimum bundle of benefits. In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need. So those people aren't being forced off the employers' plans, they are choosing to switch.

Priebus also ignores 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before the Obama law, but who will get coverage after passage of the law, perhaps because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers.

After accounting for these other groups, that still leaves about 11 million people ""who would have had an offer of employment-based coverage under prior law"" who will not have an offer under the new law, CBO says. That’s about 7 percent of the roughly 161 million people projected to have employment-based coverage under prior law, according to CBO.

While not as big as the 20 million Priebus cited -- and while it’s partly offset by the 9 million who would gain employer coverage under the law -- this is not a trivial number. Still, it’s important to keep a few bits of context in mind.

The people who lose insurance this way won’t, for the most part, be left without insurance options. They should have access to coverage on the exchanges, perhaps with subsidies. And depending on their income level, they may have access to Medicaid or the State Children’s Health Insurance Plan, which were expanded as part of the law.

Indeed, health care experts say that a big reason why companies may drop coverage is specifically because their employees will be able to go onto the exchanges and get guaranteed, and in many cases, subsidized coverage.

And again, contrary to Priebus's implication, the law is expected to result in a huge gain in the number of people getting coverage.

In addition, CBO expects that the employers who drop coverage ""will generally have to raise the cash compensation of their employees to compete with employers who continue to offer health insurance."" It’s unclear whether they will raise wages and salaries by enough to compensate for the lost insurance, but it’s still worth remembering that any change will likely be something of a trade-off for the employee in question -- no more employer insurance, but more cash compensation.

Finally, a number of other estimates by groups other than CBO tend to track with CBO’s baseline estimate, rather than with Priebus’ figure. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016.

Our ruling

Priebus’ number does appear in the CBO report he references in the op-ed, but it’s not the primary estimate -- it’s one of four alternative scenarios, and easily the one with the biggest decrease. So the number is cherry-picked.

His claim also suggests that 20 million people are being forced out of the coverage, when in fact many will choose voluntarily to switch to better coverage. And he conveniently ignores the estimates that 9 million people who didn't have employer coverage will get it because of the law, at least according to CBO’s estimates.

His claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context, which is our definition of Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280970481C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/23/reince-priebus/reince-priebus-says-health-care-law-could-mean-man/

N.H. Republicans say Shea-Porter ducked town hall meetings
","
Town hall-style meetings have a deep history in New Hampshire politics. But some state analysts fear the tradition of skipping these meetings is growing among lawmakers.

In a statement released earlier this month, the N.H. Republican Party took aim at congressional candidate and former Democratic U.S. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter, criticizing her record of hosting Town Hall sessions during her time in office.

Shea-Porter, who served in Congress from 2007-2010, is challenging Republican incumbent Rep. Frank Guinta for his First District seat in this fall’s elections.

""Carol Shea-Porter is still ignoring the problems of the economy and is instead focused on partisan games,"" Tory Mazzola, executive director of the state Republican Party, wrote March 8 in an email. ""(Her) record of helping people get back to work is as bleak as her record of refusing to host town halls when she was in Congress.""

We’ll leave it to voters to decide about the former congresswoman’s jobs record, but as for her history with town hall meetings, that sounds like a job for PolitiFact.

Shea-Porter, like some of her former congressional colleagues, has been taking heat for years over town hall meetings.

The former House member held 14 meetings over her first term in office, nine the first year and five the second, according to a campaign spokeswoman. But, after her re-election in 2008, heated discussion of federal healthcare reform prompted a series of protests and shouting matches at meetings across the country, and Shea-Porter initially scheduled only telephone town hall sessions instead of regular meetings.

This drew criticism from several state newspapers.  

""We know how a town meeting is supposed to work, and it certainly isn't by telephone. It is neighbors meeting face-to-face to discuss the issues,"" the Portsmouth Herald wrote Aug. 16 in an editorial titled ""Delegations should meet with voters.""

The Union Leader, the state’s largest newspaper, followed up two days later, criticizing Shea-Porter and fellow U.S. Rep. Paul Hodes, D-N.H. for skipping the meetings.

""Hodes and Shea-Porter need to put down the phone and the other contrived and restricted public access points they have ginned up and instead place themselves in front of the public,"" the paper wrote in a similar editorial. ""Really. It's not difficult.""

Within two weeks, Shea-Porter heeded the calls, scheduling a pair of public meetings over one day at the end of the summer recess to discuss healthcare reform.

""This is exactly what we wanted to hear,"" Shea-Porter told the Portsmouth Herald after the session, which was interrupted by shouts and boos. ""The questions were tough, but we were pleased people showed up.""

Five months later, she returned to the state during the next congressional recess, hosting three town hall sessions in two days over a January weekend in 2010. And, she returned to the state two months after that to speak on the Affordable Care Act, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010.

During that time, she had eight public meetings in 10 days, touting the the federal health care law. Those sessions, which drew hefty protest and complaints, according to media reports, brought her town hall number up to 13 meetings between August 2009 and April 2010.

Here's how that compares with other members of the N.H. delegation:

Guinta, who defeated Shea-Porter in the November 2010 election, has held 19 town halls since he took office last year, according to spokesman J. Mark Powell. But, both U.S. Rep. Charlie Bass, and Republican U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte, held 10 such sessions last year - one in each county, spokesmen of the lawmakers said. While U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen has served since 2008, her office failed to offer specific numbers on the senator's public meetings with constituents.

Despite the public meetings, Shea-Porter took some criticism for her meeting schedule. In June 2010, the New York Times included her in a story about Democrats who did not hold town halls to avoid criticism.

""In New Hampshire, where open political meetings are deeply ingrained in the state’s traditions, Representative Carol Shea-Porter’s campaign Web site had this message for visitors: ‘No upcoming events scheduled. Please visit us again soon!’,"" reporter Jeff Zeleny wrote in the June 6, 2010 article titled ""Democrats Skip Town Halls to Avoid Voter Outrage.’

Still other publications noted Shea-Porter’s efforts to meet voters. In August 2010, Drew Cline, opinions editor of the Union Leader tweeted a correction to an Aug. 10 editorial that had suggested she held no such meetings. And, before that, in March 2010, the national political website RealClearPolitics.com credited Shea-Porter as one of the members of Congress to continue to hold meetings amid the strong criticism.

""But others appear to have signed on to the plan for aggressive outreach. Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D-NH), for instance, has four town hall meetings planned specifically about health care,"" reporter Mike Memoli wrote in a March 26, 2010 post.

Our ruling:

The Republican party says Shea Porter had a ""record of refusing to host town halls when she was in Congress.""

There was a point a few years ago when Shea-Porter did not hold town hall meetings. She drew criticism from New Hampshire news outlets after she scheduled no in-person meetings between April 2008 and August 2009, while the federal health care debate reached a fever pitch.

But, once she resumed the public forums, she stayed in plain sight. In the eight months between August 2009 and April 2010, she hosted 13 meetings, more than some members of the current congressional delegation, and, after she voted in favor of the controversial Affordable Care Act, she went before her constituents, holding eight meetings in less than two weeks.

Rick Perry says that in 2010, nearly 80% of women served in Women's Health Program received services from non-Planned Parenthood clinic
","
Gov. Rick Perry has been using statistics to help defend the state’s decision to exclude Planned Parenthood clinics from a family planning program for low-income Texas women. 
Perry’s office suggested in a tweet posted March 15, 2012, that Planned Parenthood’s involvement in the Texas Medicaid Women’s Health Program is minimal, saying: ""In FY 2010, nearly 80% of women served received WHP services from non Planned Parenthood providers."" 
Scott Braddock, then hosting a Houston radio news program, responded with a tweet of his own, urging us to check whether Perry is right. 
We looked into Perry’s claim amid debate over the state’s decision, which has led the Obama administration to set in motion a phased-in cutoff of federal funds for the program. And we found a weakness in the governor’s figure. 
The state started the Women’s Health Program in 2007. It offers free family planning services, including birth control, to low-income women between the ages of 18 and 44. The goal is to reduce the number of births paid for by Medicaid — the health insurance program for the poor and disabled that is jointly financed by the federal government and the state — by reducing the number of unplanned pregnancies. 
In Texas, adult women generally aren’t eligible for Medicaid unless they are pregnant or disabled. The Women’s Health Program — which is largely financed by the federal government — extends family planning services to women who don’t qualify for Medicaid but whose future births would. 
Through the program, eligible women receive an annual family planning exam that may include a Pap smear as well as other health screenings. The program also pays for birth control such as pills and condoms and family planning counseling. 
To participate in the program, providers — including doctors and clinics — must be enrolled with the state as Medicaid providers and certify that they do not perform elective abortions. Since the program’s start, dozens of Planned Parenthood health centers in Texas have qualified because they don’t provide abortions and are legally separated from Planned Parenthood clinics that do. 
That is changing, however. The Texas health and human services commissioner signed a rule in February 2012 barring entities affiliated with abortion providers from the program, disqualifying Planned Parenthood health centers that do not provide abortions. In response, the Obama administration declined to renew the program, arguing that Texas’ new rule violates federal law by restricting women’s abilities to choose their own caregivers. Perry has pledged to continue the program with state money — and without Planned Parenthood. 
So, is Perry correct that during the state’s fiscal year 2010 — Sept. 1, 2009, through Aug. 31, 2010 — nearly 80 percent of the women who received services under the program did so from a provider that wasn’t Planned Parenthood? 
For answers, Perry spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed us to the state’s Health and Human Services Commission. 
Stephanie Goodman, a commission spokeswoman, told us that Perry’s ""nearly 80 percent"" figure is based on a data analysis that included three statistics for fiscal 2010: 
1) The total number of women who were served under the program (106,711)
2) The number who received services from a Planned Parenthood clinic (49,162)
3) The number who received services from ""all other providers"" (84,805) 
To arrive at the ""nearly 80 percent"" figure, Perry’s office calculated that 84,805 (number of women served by ""all other providers"") is 79.5 percent of 106,711 (total number of women served). Alternatively, 49,162 (number served by Planned Parenthood) is 46.1 percent of 106,711. 
So, according to state data, Planned Parenthood served 46 percent of 2010 clients while other types of providers served 80 percent. 
That’s a total of 126 percent! How can that be? 
If you look at the numbers closely, you’ll see that when added together, No. 2 and No. 3 are greater than No. 1. In other words, the number of women who received services from Planned Parenthood in fiscal 2010 plus the number of women who received services from ""all other providers"" adds up to more than the total number of women served in the program that year. 
That’s because some women received services from both types of providers, so they were counted in both categories: 27,256 women, to be exact. 
Why the overlap? 
We found a couple of possible explanations. 
In an email, Frazier touched on one: Some women ""see more than one provider in a year."" While it’s true that about 40 percent of women saw a Planned Parenthood provider in fiscal 2010, Frazier wrote, it’s also true that almost 80 percent went to a provider that was not part of Planned Parenthood. 
Goodman told us that some portion of the 27,256 women served by both a Planned Parenthood clinic and another type of provider could have simply changed their providers during the year. Goodman said that can happen for many reasons. ""Our clients tend to move more than most people — that’s a reflection of their income and the difficulty in maintaining housing,"" she said. 
Sarah Wheat, interim co-CEO of the Austin-area Planned Parenthood, suggested that some women might go to a Planned Parenthood center for Women’s Health Program services when they need to be seen immediately — for example, if they are having trouble with their birth control — and can’t get an appointment with their regular doctor. Wheat said that’s because Planned Parenthood clinics can often serve women more quickly than other types of providers. 
The other possible overlap reason: Goodman told us that a woman would be counted in both categories if she had an office visit at a Planned Parenthood clinic that was followed by the Planned Parenthood sending tests from the visit to an outside lab for processing. In that case, the only ""services"" that a woman would have received from a non-Planned Parenthood provider would be lab testing. 
Wheat told us that it’s common for Planned Parenthood centers to send tests for Women’s Health Program clients to be processed at an outside lab. 
Goodman told us that the commission did not have data available that would show how many of the 27,256 women recorded as having been served by both Planned Parenthood and another type of provider showed up in the ""all other providers"" category for lab work alone, although she said it’s probably a significant number. 
Subtract the number of women in the ""all other providers"" category who were also served by a Planned Parenthood provider in fiscal 2010 and you get 57,549. That’s the number of women who got all of their Women’s Health Program services from providers not linked to Planned Parenthood — or 54 percent, not 80 percent, of the women served in the program in those 12 months. 
When we pointed that out to the governor’s office, Frazier told us via email that the 80 percent figure shows that Planned Parenthood can’t claim they service an entire 45 percent of women in the program. ""Whether it’s lab work or an actual doctor’s visit, these non-(Planned Parenthood) providers are absorbing a large part of the services provided to women under the program,"" she said. 
Our ruling 
On its face, Perry’s statement is accurate. Nearly 80 percent of the women served in the Women’s Health Program in fiscal 2010 did receive a service from a non-Planned Parenthood provider. 
However, Perry’s statement implies that 8 in 10 program beneficiaries did not visit Planned Parenthood clinics, and that’s off-base. Thirty-two percent of the women swept up in the 80 percent statistic were also served by Planned Parenthood. And it’s likely that in some of those cases, the only contact a woman had with a non-Planned Parenthood provider was the processing of her lab work. 
The available state data show that 54 percent of Women’s Health Program clients in fiscal 2010 received all their services from a provider not linked to Planned Parenthood. 
We rate Perry’s statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F21EC0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/23/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-2010-nearly-80-women-served-womens/

U.S. Rep. Jim Moran, D-8th, recently spoke on the U.S. House floor against drilling off the shores of Virginia, saying the small amount of government money it would produce is not worth the environmental risk.

""And the revenue generated by drilling off Virginia’s coast? $40 million over 10 years,"" he said on Feb. 15.  

We wondered about Moran’s seemingly low estimate for revenues, recalling predictions made by many drilling advocates -- including Gov. Bob McDonnell -- that Virginia’s government stands to gain at least $250 million a year. So we looked into the congressman’s claim.

Moran was railing against H.R. 3408, which would authorize drilling federally owned oil shale and calls for leases in several coastal regions, including Virginia. Many state officials, including McDonnell and Democratic Senators Mark Warner and Jim Webb, support offshore drilling, saying it could provide needed jobs, energy and money for the state.

Virginia was included in the federal government’s offshore drilling plan last decade. But President Barack Obama rescinded that in 2010, canceling the sale of leases of 4 million acres off Virginia’s coast after the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico.

A bill that would have allowed drilling 50 miles or more off Virginia’s coast died in the House of Representatives last May.

Moran’s office, to back the congressman’s claim, used the Congressional Budget Office cost estimate for that bill in arguing against H.R. 3408.

The CBO report does say that the federal government will collect only $40 million over the next 10 years. But the analysis, ordered by the House Committee on Natural Resources, is confined to a tiny portion of the government revenue that drilling could generate.

Should the Virginia coastal waters be opened for drilling, oil companies would submit bids to the Interior Department for leasing space on the ocean floor and upfront bonus payments they would make to the government for the right to test and drill.

The CBO’s $40 million figure is merely an estimate of the bonus payments that would come from drilling off Virginia’s coast, according to Spencer Pedersen, a spokesman for the House Interior Committee. The CBO has not projected other government revenues the venture would produce.  

The big money, however, would start once oil production began, likely toward the end of the decade. Companies would pay royalties to the federal government that are expected to generate tens of millions of dollars annually during the early years of drilling, and many hundreds of millions of dollars down the road.

Energy companies pay the federal government an 18.75 percent royalty on offshore oil and natural gas production. Typically, royalty payments represent about 90 percent of federal revenue from leasing activity on public lands. 

Virginia officials are hoping for a 37.5 percent cut from all of the offshore drilling payments to the federal government--bonus bids, lease payments and royalties. The federal government shares 37.5 percent with Gulf Coast states.

A number of steps must occur, however, before money, oil or natural gas starts flowing.

Congress must approve legislation, such as H.R. 3408, that would include the ocean floor off Virginia in a leasing plan, and the president must sign it. Obama, during his State of the Union address early this year, called for increased U.S. oil production and endorsed new lease sales in the Gulf of Mexico and off Alaska’s northern coast. But the president has not indicated whether he’s willing to lift his 2010 moratorium on Atlantic Coast drilling.  

Should the Virginia coast become part of the plan, the CBO report says the lease sale would not likely occur until 2015.

Next, the winning companies would need to map the ocean floor and explore the resources with a few test bores. If the tests were successful, the companies would request a permit from the federal government to build an oil rig. All those steps take time; experts, including a consultant for the American Petroleum Institute, said drilling wouldn’t start until at least 2018 or 2019.

There are wide-ranging estimates of the potential government revenues from drilling off Virginia’s coast. We tried to come up with our own number using middle-of-the-road projections for the cost of energy and the amount of offshore resources.

The Energy Information Administration’s projection for inflation-adjusted price of a barrel of oil through 2035 is $137.02. Natural gas for the same period is expected to have an average cost of $6.53 per thousand cubic feet.

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management estimated in 2011 that the seabed in the Atlantic Ocean caps 3.3 billion barrels of oil and 31.28 trillion cubic feet of natural gas. The Virginia coast comprises about 10 percent of the Atlantic shore, so if the resources and revenue are distributed proportionally, and we assume a 37.5 percent share to the states, the federal government would receive average $410.3 million annually and pay Virginia a $153.8 million cut.

The governor’s estimates of annual state revenue of about $250 million uses energy industry estimates based on the upper end of oil and natural gas resource projections.

But both estimates are an average annual amount over 30 years of production; it would take more than a decade for production to ramp up, according to the API consultant. In the early years of drilling, the state should expect to realize less than a fifth of the revenues that would come in when oil rigs hit full production.

There’s one more big if: The 2011 estimates of the quantity of oil and natural gas in the region are based on surveys that are 40 to 50 years old.  There’s really no way to know how much is under the shelf until exploration is done.

Our ruling

Moran, opposing legislation that would open Virginia’s coast to drilling for oil and natural gas, said the venture would generate only $40 million in government revenue over the next 10 years.

The Democrat based his claim on a CBO report but misinterpreted what it said. The $40 million figure refers to a minor source of the revenue Virginia and Washington would share: upfront bonus payments energy companies would give the federal government for the right to test and drill.

Beyond the $40 million, the companies would pay to lease space on the ocean floor. But more importantly, Moran omits that the companies would pay royalties on the offshore oil and gas they produced, which make up about 90 of the revenues for federal and state governments. In the early years of drilling, which could begin in 2018 or 2019, the royalties could produce tens of millions. Down the road -- beyond the 10-year period Moran addressed -- the royalties could translate into many hundreds of millions annually.

Nothing is certain about drilling off Virginia’s coast, but Moran misused a very limited projection to create a misleading characterization of the venture’s potential. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968BD7C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/23/jim-moran/moran-says-dilling-virginias-coast-will-net-4-mill/
"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Sheila Oliver']","
Sheila Oliver claims New Jerseyans are the “most educated” in the nation
","
Assembly Speaker Sheila Oliver is tired of hearing people suggest that New Jersey has a problem of adequately educating its residents.

In fact, according to Oliver, New Jerseyans are the ""most educated"" in the nation.

The Essex County Democrat extolled the virtues of the Garden State during a Feb. 27 speech at the Rebovich Institute for New Jersey Politics at Rider University.

""New Jersey is a great place. We probably have the best strategic position on the East Coast. We have so many natural assets,"" Oliver told the audience. ""And, I’m gonna get into the subject of education in a moment, but I want to tell you New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country. And we need to stop this self-fulfilling efficacy that we’ve got a problem when it comes to adequately educating people in our state.""

Oliver’s claim about us having the ""most educated population of all the states"" is not far off, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

In recent years, New Jersey has stood in fifth place among the states for the percentage of its residents, 25 years old and over, who have at least a bachelor’s degree, according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau.

First, let’s explain the source of Oliver’s statement.

To back up the claim, Oliver spokesman Tom Hester Jr. cited various education statistics, including a 2009 news article by U.S. News & World Report about, in part, New Jersey having the highest high school graduation rate in 2006. 
He also cited a Huffington Post article that claimed the state ranked sixth for the percentage of adults between 25 and 34 years old with college degrees. 
""New Jersey has the nation’s highest high school graduation rate and ranks at the very top in student achievement and college graduation rates,"" Hester said in an email. ""Quite simply, the Speaker believes that when you combine it all together, NJ has the most educated population.""

But two experts told us the best measure to determine the ""most educated"" states is the educational attainment data compiled by the census bureau.

Through a spokesman, Thomas Snyder, director of Annual Reports for the National Center for Education Statistics at the U.S. Department of Education, said in an e-mail: ""I believe the educational attainment data are the most relevant for this question.""

David Bills, an associate professor at the University of Iowa’s College of Education, agreed that the educational attainment data is the ""best available measure.""

""I’d call it the best available measure, with the main problem being that many people complete their education after age 25, so this measure will underestimate how many people will eventually get degrees,"" Bills said in an e-mail. ""Not everyone over age 25 has completed their schooling.""

Now, let’s explain how many New Jersey residents have college degrees.

In 2009, 34.5 percent of New Jerseyans, 25 years old and over, had at least a bachelor’s degree, according to the census bureau. In 2010, 35.4 percent of state residents fit the same criteria, according to the census bureau.

In both years, New Jersey was in fifth place behind Massachusetts, Colorado, Maryland and Connecticut. Even after accounting for the margins of error attached to those statistics, New Jersey doesn’t place first.

So, New Jersey may not have the ""most educated"" population, but it certainly has one of them.

Our ruling

In a speech at Rider University, Oliver claimed ""New Jersey has the most educated population of all the states in this country.""

According to educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau, her claim is pretty much on target. In 2009 and 2010, New Jersey ranked fifth for the percentage of its population, 25 years old and over, who have at least a bachelor’s degree.

We rate the statement Mostly True.

"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'John Boehner']","
U.S. House Speaker John Boehner says new business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years
","
Its fate in the Senate and its potential economic impact remain unclear, but the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act, or JOBS, produced a rare show of bipartisanship when it was passed by the House of Representatives on March 8. House Republicans and the White House cooperated on the Republican initiative, after larger jobs measures stalled.

Sponsors said they hoped the bill would lift the low approval ratings of Congress. House Speaker John Boehner said he hoped it would make it easier for small firms to raise investment capital.

The West Chester Republican said it would help to encourage job creation in Ohio and elsewhere ""at a time when new business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years.""

Thirty years goes back to the recession of the early 1980s, which would make sense. But PolitiFact Ohio had also seen a recent report that business startups were booming. We asked Boehner's office for more information.

They pointed us first to a recent study by the outplacement consulting firm  Challenger, Gray & Christmas Inc. The study found that the number of unemployed managers and executives starting their own businesses in the second half of 2011 failed to rebound from the record lows recorded over the first half of the year.

The study also cited numbers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showing that ""it's not just the unemployed who seem turned off -- self-employment in general has decreased significantly during the recession."" The BLS reported there were 8.6 million self-employed Americans in July 2011, compared to almost 10 million in June 2007, prior to the recession.

Boehner’s staff additionally referred us to an article in Bloomberg Businessweek reporting that many indicators of startup activity are at record low levels. The per capita rate of formation of firms with employees in 2009, the most recent year tracked by the U.S. Census Bureau, was less than half its 1977 level.

Those figures, however, seemed at odds with the Kauffman Index of Entrepreneurial Activity, a widely cited annual study measuring U.S. business startup activity at the individual owner level. It comes from the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation, which works to foster entrepreneurial activity.

Its latest report, issued March 19, said that the rate of new business creation dipped during 2011, but still remained ""among the highest levels of entrepreneurship over the past 16 years,"" and showed that ""entrepreneurship is alive and well in the wake of the Great Recession.""

A previous report of the Kauffman Index said that more Americans had started businesses since the start of the recession than at any period over the previous decade and a half.

Wondering how this apparent conflict could be explained, we asked a leading authority on the subject: Scott Shane, chairman of the economics department and professor of entrepreneurial studies at Case Western Reserve University.
The numbers do look contradictory, he said, but they measure different things. Using an analogy, ""it's like measuring water in a bathtub.""

The Kauffman Index, he said, uses data from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) of the Census Bureau and Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure the percentage of the adult population, not self-employed, starting a business each month.

Using the bathtub analogy, he said, it's like putting a meter on the faucet -- the Kauffman Index measures the water's flow.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics figures, meantime, track the number of people who are self-employed, Shane said -- it's like measuring the water level in the tub -- and that number has declined, because of the people who quit self-employment. (Or who, extending the analogy, go down the drain.)

But more pertinent to the employment issue addressed by the JOBS Act and Boehner, Shane pointed out that there are two types of businesses: employer firms, which have employees, and non-employers, which do not.

Non-employer firms are 80 percent of U.S. businesses, but have much less economic impact, Shane said. Employer firms account for 97 percent of gross domestic product.

Using data from the Census Bureau and U.S. Small Business Administration, Shane found that the per capita rate of new employer business formation in 2009 (the most recent year available) was 1.32 per thousand people -- ""an astonishing 51.4 percent of the rate in 1977,"" he said. ""That is, Americans are starting new businesses with employees at half the rate they did 30 years ago.""

Not only the rate, but the raw numbers have declined, he said. In 1977, SBA figures show, Americans started 563,325 businesses with employees. In 2009, despite an increase in the population, they started 403,765.

And no previous valleys dipped so low. A spreadsheet from Shane shows that neither the rate nor number of startups since 1977 ever hit the most recent level.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Boehner's statement that new business startups are at the lowest levels in 30 years gets a rating of True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809694A9C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/23/john-boehner/us-house-speaker-john-boehner-says-new-business-st/
"['Georgia', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Transportation', 'Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network']","
Ad: Metro Atlantans spend ""260 hours a year"" commuting
","
A new ad about the region’s dismal commutes made us worry that the best years of our lives are passing us by as we sit in traffic.

""Metro Atlanta, we have a problem,"" it says. ""One of the longest average commutes in America. Over an hour every day, five hours a week you don’t spend with your family -- 260 hours a year.""

This made your PolitiFact Georgia team sad. While we’re behind the wheel cursing traffic, we may be missing all of those Hallmark card experiences that are supposed to make the daily grind worthwhile.

A daughter’s first steps. Her dance recitals. That magic moment when you realize her boyfriend is no good and you need to run him off with a baseball bat.

Is what the ad is saying true?

The ad was sponsored by the Metro Atlanta Voter Education Network, a group of businesses and civic groups. They are banding together to tell voters about a July 31 referendum that asks voters to raise sales taxes to fund transportation projects across the region.    

Leaders hope to raise $6.14 billion over 10 years for a long list of transportation projects. An additional $1 billion would fund county and town projects.

Backers say that without it, the region will lose business to other places that are doing more to deal with traffic.

The ad was based on data from a February 2012 report from the Georgia Department of Transportation, a MAVEN spokeswoman told PolitiFact Georgia. The report said that the average work commute time in metro Atlanta was 30.3 minutes in 2010, which is up from 30.1 minutes in 2009.

The report cited the 2010 American Community Survey, a yearly national survey conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. It reported times for a 28-county area surrounding Atlanta.  

The number cited in the commercial is the commute time for people traveling from home to work by all modes of transportation, including riding the train, walking, or using a bicycle.

Travel times for those who drive are similar. Those who commute alone in a car, truck or van spent an estimated 29.1 minutes on the road. Those who carpooled spent about 32.6 minutes.

If each commute is about 30 minutes, that means the average worker in metro Atlanta spends one hour commuting each day. If you work five days a week, 52 weeks a year, that equals 260 hours, the number cited in the commercial.  

We found a few problems with this calculation.

Commuting expert Alan Pisarski, who frequently writes about transportation issues and testifies before Congress, told PolitiFact Georgia that the American Community Survey is generally the best -- and often only -- source for commute times in metro regions or cities.

But the survey is limited. It publishes times for trips to work, not trips home. If you’re trying to find the average time spent commuting during a whole day, multiplying the ACS survey figure by two won’t necessarily give you the right answer. The afternoon commute might be shorter or longer.

PolitiFact Georgia also noted that commuters often don’t work all 52 weeks in a year. They often get a couple of weeks worth of vacation. The average time spent commuting each year might not be 260 hours.  

We hunted for additional data in metro Atlanta, but did not find any recent research. We found nothing that contradicted their numbers, either.  

So what’s our conclusion?

MAVEN’s television ad is based on information from the census that says the average trip to work in the Atlanta region is about 30 minutes.   

It was a bit of a leap for MAVEN to conclude that based on morning commute data, metro Atlantans spend ""over an hour every day"" traveling to and from work.
The afternoon commute might be longer or shorter. We don’t know because it’s not part of the census data.

It was a bigger leap for them to conclude that since the year is 52 weeks long, workers therefore spend ""260 hours a year"" commuting. Workers often get a week or so of vacation or sick leave.

MAVEN’s numbers are OK for a back-of-the-envelope calculation. They’re also within reason.  

However, metro Atlanta is so big and the commutes can be so different that assuming a trip to work takes as much time as the one back home is a bridge too far.

We give MAVEN a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097977F80>],/factchecks/2012/mar/23/metro-atlanta-voter-education-network/ad-commute-takes-260-hours-year/

Arthenia Joyner says there were warnings on 'stand your ground' law
","The possibility that Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law could protect a neighborhood watchman who shot and killed an unarmed teen last month has lawmakers who opposed the measure saying told you so. ""When we passed the law, we said it portends horrific events when people’s lives were put into these situations, and my worst fears came to fruition,"" Sen. Arthenia Joyner, D-Tampa, said March 20, 2012. ""A young life was snuffed out."" Joyner was in the state House when ""stand your ground"" passed in 2005 and fears the law — which allows people to use deadly force in cases of self-defense when they believe their life is at risk — could save 28-year-old shooter George Zimmerman from prosecution. Zimmerman killed 17-year-old Trayvon Martin in the Orlando suburb of Sanford on Feb. 26, police say. As the investigation unfolds, it’s worthwhile to look back to the origins of the ""stand your ground"" law and the concerns legislators like Joyner had at the time. The measure passed the Senate 39-0 and the House 94-20. It was signed into law by Gov. Jeb Bush. Joyner and 19 other House Democrats voted against the bill. To check her claim, we went to the video archives to see what was said during House debate on April 5, 2005. ""For a House that talks about the culture of life, it’s ironic that we would be devaluing life in this bill, which is exactly what we’re doing,"" said Rep. Dan Gelber, a former federal prosecutor from Miami Beach who later was elected to the Senate. Gelber said Floridians already had the right to defend themselves in their homes and offered an amendment that would restore a person’s duty to retreat from a confrontation in public places. Rep. Eleanor Sobel, a South Florida Democrat who now serves in the Senate, said Gelber’s amendment would reduce ""chaos on the street."" Republicans defeated Gelber’s amendment on a voice vote. The bill’s sponsor, Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, called an obligation to retreat ""a good way to get shot in the back."" Members debated another unsuccessful amendment from Rep. Jack Seiler, a Democrat who is now mayor of Fort Lauderdale. Seiler’s proposal would have allowed for rebuttal to a person’s claim of self-defense. ""We are going to give blanket immunity to criminals when they commit crime,"" Seiler said. Other voices from the hour-long debate: • ""I believe that we’re going to have open season in our communities, as it relates to confrontations throughout this state,"" said former Rep. Frank Peterman. D-St. Petersburg. • ""What would happen if I presumed that there was a threat when actually there was not a threat? I would hate to think that I would react and take someone’s life, or do bodily harm to someone, who actually only looked a little different than I looked,"" said Rep. Priscilla Taylor, D-West Palm Beach. • ""When you give a person the right to use deadly force anywhere they’re lawfully supposed to be, then we open Pandora’s Box, and inside the box will be death for some persons,"" Joyner said. • ""In a few years, you will be back trying to fix this bill,"" said Rep. Ken Gottlieb, D-Hollywood. The House debate stands in contrast to the Senate. Sen. Steve Geller, D-Hallandale Beach, tried changing the bill before the vote so that it would not apply to public places. The Senate voted down his amendment in minutes. The vote to pass the bill was then unanimous, with Democrats, including Sen. Rod Smith, currently chair of the Florida Democratic Party, voting yes. ""We’d be seen as Democrats soft on crime,"" Geller explained, according to an account from the Associated Press. Overall, the warnings comprised a slim opposition to a very popular law.

PAC ad sketches Romney as abortion flip-flopper
","
Fresh off a resounding primary win in Illinois, the Romney campaign used the momentum to make the case that the Republican primary contest was all but wrapped up and the former Massachusetts governor would inevitably be the nominee.

Then the Etch A Sketch remark happened.

On March 21, 2012, Mitt Romney’s senior communications director, Eric Fehrnstrom, gave an interview on CNN about the strategy for the general election. Fehrnstrom was asked why Romney’s opponents, Rick Santorum and Newt Gingrich, haven’t endorsed him yet and how their far-right pressure on Romney will resonate with independent voters.

""It's fair to say that John McCain was considerably a more moderate candidate than the ones that Gov. Romney faces now,"" said political comedian John Fugelsang. ""Is there a concern that the pressure from Santorum and Gingrich might force the governor to tack so far to right it would hurt him with moderate voters in the general election?""

Fehrnstrom answered, ""Well, I think you hit a reset button for the fall campaign. Everything changes. It's almost like an Etch A Sketch. You can kind of shake it up and we start all over again.""

As expected, Romney’s opponents pounced. Gingrich and Santorum both held up the perennial children’s toy as props at campaign appearances. Democrats cranked out ads capitalizing on the line, which provided an almost too-easy inroad to raising questions -- again -- about Romney’s firmness on issues.

Here we’ll check one such ad, put out by the Democratic super PAC American Bridge 21st Century, which suggests that Romney has flip-flopped on abortion.

First, the toy

In case you skipped childhood, we’ll tell you a bit about the Etch A Sketch.

First manufactured in the 1950s, the Etch A Sketch is a flat tablet with a red frame, gray face and two white knobs for drawing -- like an iPad from the paleolithic period. The two knobs draw vertical and horizontal lines on the screen as they’re turned, and those with superior hand-eye coordination are said to be able to make curving lines. For most Etch A Sketchers, though, a side view of a staircase qualifies as a masterpiece.

The feature Fehrnstrom analogized was its reusability. When you’re done drawing, you flip it over and shake it up. Little beads rattle around inside to clear the screen, and Voila! You once again have a blank canvas.

Now, the ad

The ad was produced by American Bridge 21st Century, a Democratic super PAC. In the ad, released the same day as Fehrnstrom’s comment, a clip of his interview plays, including the Etch A Sketch comment. Then the toy appears, with the words ""Romney on the issues"" above it. Music that sounds like it’s coming from a jack-in-the-box plays in the background.

The first quote attributed to Romney appears on the Etch A Sketch screen: ""I support a woman’s right to choose.""

Then the Etch A Sketch shakes, the words vanish and the next quote appears.

""I believe strongly in protecting life.""

The ad goes on to portray Romney’s apparent flip flops on the NRA and his loyalty to Ronald Reagan. (PolitiFact has looked into similar accusations before. See our checks here on the NRA and here on Reagan.)

For this fact-check, we’ll see if the two abortion quotes are accurate.

We found a Boston Globe story from May, 1994, when Romney was in a primary battle for U.S. Senate. At the time, he said he supported abortion rights and the right to privacy established by Roe v. Wade. But even then, opponents accused him of being a pro-choice pretender.

Following a debate with opponent John Lakian, Romney defended an endorsement he had received from Massachusetts’ state treasurer Joe Malone, an abortion opponent. Lakian had said Malone backed him ""to reward the pro-life contingent that was very much in Mitt's camp at the convention,"" according to the Globe.

Romney responded: ""The idea that somehow Joe Malone endorsed me because he's pro-life despite the fact that I support a woman's right to choose doesn't follow very well.""

That’s the only quote from Romney we found that matches American Bridge’s ad verbatim. Numerous other statements he’s made, however, express the same sentiment.

For one, in a debate later in the 1994 race against Democratic Sen. Edward Kennedy, Romney said, ""I believe that abortion should be safe and legal in this country."" And, ""I believe that since Roe v. Wade has been the law for 20 years, it should be sustained and supported. And I sustain and support that law and support the right of a woman to make that choice.""
       
For another, in his 2002 campaign for governor, Romney said during a debate, ""I will preserve and protect a woman's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard.""

The second Romney quote in American Bridge’s ad reflects his changed stance on the issue. ""I believe strongly in protecting life,"" the ad says.

We could find no instance of Romney saying those exact words. American Bridge’s spokesman Chris Harris told us the quotes ""were paraphrased so they fit on a small Etch A Sketch screen. We ensured they were airtight, accurate portrayals of his positions, both past and present.""

It’s well-documented that Romney’s past and present positions on abortion differ from each other. In a June 18, 2011, op-ed in the conservative National Review Romney laid out his views:

""I am pro-life and believe that abortion should be limited to only instances of rape, incest, or to save the life of the mother. I support the reversal of Roe v. Wade, because it is bad law and bad medicine. Roe was a misguided ruling that was a result of a small group of activist federal judges legislating from the bench. I support the Hyde Amendment, which broadly bars the use of federal funds for abortions. And as president, I will support efforts to prohibit federal funding for any organization like Planned Parenthood, which primarily performs abortions or offers abortion-related services.""

""I believe people understand that I'm firmly pro-life,"" he said in a debate that same month.

In October 2011 he told former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee on Fox News, ""I'd make sure that the progress that has been made to provide for life and to protect human life is not progress that would be reversed.""

Finally, we have examined Romney’s shifting position on abortion when others have made the accusation. In each case, we rated the charge True. (Please see our source list.)

Our ruling

American Bridge’s ad suggests that Romney has been both an abortion rights supporter and an opponent. Using statements on an Etch A Sketch screen, the ad first portrays Romney as supporting abortion rights, then as opposing them. In other words, a flip flop.

The quotes in the ad accurately portray Romney’s past and present stances, but the punctuation suggests they are his actual words. The second statement was not a literal quote, and that’s worth noting, but it was a true reflection of Romney's position. According to our Truth-O-Meter, this ad passes muster. It’s accurate and doesn’t leave out anything important. We rate it True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F90400>],/factchecks/2012/mar/22/american-bridge-21st-century/pac-ad-sketches-romney-abortion-flip-flopper/

Marco Rubio says oil spill fine money could go to Great Lakes and West Coast
","
A year after the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, Florida’s two senators -- Republican Marco Rubio and Democrat Bill Nelson -- joined forces to support the RESTORE Act, a bipartisan effort to direct money from BP fines to Florida and other Gulf states affected by the 2010 oil spill.

But when the bill reached the Senate floor March 8 for a key vote, Rubio voted ""no.""

Why the change of heart?

Rubio said the bill that passed the Senate was ""far different"" than the one he supported in July.

""What started as a genuine bipartisan effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration has now turned into a raw deal that increases taxes, creates a new environmental bureaucracy, and could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast that had nothing to do with the oil spill,"" Rubio said.

""This is no longer a Gulf Coast restoration bill, it’s a federal power grab that exploits the BP spill to pay for special interest projects driven by the usual 'what's in it for me' Washington mentality,"" he said. ""I will not support raising taxes to pay for BP’s mess or to pay for new spending projects across the country that have nothing to do with Gulf Coast restoration.""

Rubio’s vote attracted attention because he was the only Gulf Coast senator to oppose the bill, and because a poll showed the vast majority of Floridians -- including Republicans and tea party supporters -- were in favor of the RESTORE Act.

Was Rubio correct to imply that states such as Michigan or California could get money related to the oil spill across the country? We decided to check it out.

The RESTORE Act

The RESTORE Act stands for the Resources and Ecosystems Sustainability, Tourism Opportunities and Revived Economies. It was introduced in July 2011 by Sen. Mary Landrieu, D-La., and was cosponsored by Rubio, Nelson and other senators.

The legislation directs 80 percent of the fines in connection with the Deepwater Horizon explosion to go to Gulf Coast projects, and the remainder to the U.S. Treasury. In the Gulf, the money could be used for mitigating damage to wildlife, monitoring fisheries, promoting tourism and job creation. The fines could hit $20 billion.

On Sept. 21, the Senate’s committee on Environment and Public Works agreed to add an amendment that would create the National Endowment for the Oceans, a separate project which had stalled after being proposed in July 2010. Rubio is not a member of that committee.

As the title suggests, the endowment is a national program with money available for coastal areas including -- you guessed it -- the Great Lakes and West Coast among other places.

Environmentalists applauded that addition.

""We had the largest ecosystem damaging disaster we ever had,"" said Brian Moore, legislative director at National Audubon. ""Wouldn’t it be a good idea to divert a small portion of that to study the health of all our oceans and large bodies of water?""

That ""small portion"" for the ocean endowment refers to half of the interest from the oil spill fine, not the fine itself. It’s impossible to predict what portion could go to the Great Lakes or West Coast, said Emily Woglom, director of government relations at the Ocean Conservancy.

""It will be driven by merits of proposals, and regardless, we are likely talking about millions of dollars for ocean endowment as compared to billions of dollars for the gulf restoration fund,"" she said.

The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the RESTORE Act could fund an endowment of $138 million by 2021 for both the ocean endowment and the Gulf of Mexico.

On Feb. 15, 2012, Nelson submitted an amendment to the transportation bill in the Senate that included the version of the RESTORE Act with the oceans provision. Rubio was a cosponsor.

On March 7, Nelson submitted the amendment again, but Rubio was no longer a cosponsor. On March 8, the Senate passed the amendment 76-22, prompting Rubio’s protest. The Senate passed the full transportation bill March 14 again by 76-22 with Rubio again voting ""no.""

Rubio’s ""no"" vote on the RESTORE Act puzzled some its supporters: Why didn’t he speak up publicly earlier?

Rubio spokesman Alex Conant said that on the original bill that ""we made clear on a staff level that Sen. Rubio wouldn’t support the National Endowment for Oceans. … We were hoping the final bill would not include that and (Rubio would) be able to support it.""

The ocean endowment wasn’t the only part that bothered Rubio. He explained his vote in more detail in an editorial, and he included criticism of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, an existing fund that uses fees from oil and gas leasing in federal waters to purchase and protect land. Language was added to the RESTORE Act to allow the conservation fund to get a boost in money.

Woglom of the Ocean Conservancy said that technically the conservation fund isn’t getting BP fine money, but that the RESTORE Act and the Conservation Fund are sharing an offset to cover the increase in spending. Under pay-go budget rules, any change has to be accounted as new spending even if it comes from fines, and therefore needs an offset.

The offset comes out of money generated by a delay in an interest rate adjustment for business investment. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist called that a tax increase. Rubio signed Norquist’s tax pledge in 2009, and if Rubio had voted for the RESTORE Act, Norquist could make the case that Rubio had violated his pledge.

Moore, who favors the Land and Conservation Fund, said that isn’t a tax increase -- it extends an existing statute that makes businesses that make a profit overseas continue to pay a tax.

RESTORE had not made it into law as of March 20, 2012, because the House had not passed a full transportation bill. The House version of RESTORE doesn’t include the oceans endowment, so the two chambers will need to resolve their differences.

Our ruling 
Rubio said the RESTORE Act started as an ""effort to dedicate as much BP fine money as possible towards Gulf Coast restoration"" but now ""could steer money to places like the Great Lakes and West Coast."" It's not the fine money itself that could go to other bodies of water, but interest from the fines. Half the interest could go to an ocean endowment for coastal regions nationwide, including the Great Lakes and West Coast. The bulk of the fines themselves will still go to the Gulf Coast. The small amount was set aside to attract votes from non-Gulf senators. 
And in fact, the legislation passed the Senate by a wide enough margin to guarantee that Rubio’s home state will get the money and still allow him to say he voted against tax increases.

Publicly, Rubio was quiet about the provision to protect other bodies of water for months, though we are rating him here on the truthfulness of his words, not the timing of his protest. Some money from the RESTORE Act could go to the Great Lakes and the West Coast, but the bulk of the money -- particularly the fines themselves -- would still go to the Gulf Coast. We rate his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A35B140>],/factchecks/2012/mar/22/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-oil-spill-fine-money-great-lakes/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Barack Obama is “ending Medicare as we know it.”
","
Mitt Romney is trying to turn the tables on President Barack Obama by using a favorite Democratic line against him, accusing Obama of ""ending Medicare as we know it.""

That's been a trusty line for the Democrats, with variations used in campaign commercials and press releases over the past couple of years. It was used to criticize Republicans who supported Rep. Paul Ryan's plan to dramatically change Medicare and was uttered so often that we chose it as 2011 Lie of the Year.  But this time, it's coming from a Republican against the Democratic president.

The Romney campaign used it in a news release that listed five questions, each beginning with ""Why is President Obama ending Medicare as we know it...""

• ""by allowing it to go bankrupt in less than 15 years?""

• ""by funding Obamacare through $500 billion In Medicare cuts for today’s seniors?""

• ""by creating an unaccountable board to ration care for today’s seniors?""

• ""by destroying Medicare Advantage for today’s seniors?""

• ""by ending access to care for today’s seniors?""

Scaring senior citizens about Medicare has long been a part of both parties' playbooks. But we hadn't heard of any plan from President Obama to dramatically alter the senior health care plan, so we thought it worthwhile to check the claim.

It's important to note that Obama's plan for Medicare hasn't been as big and sweeping as Ryan's. It has involved cutting the growth of future spending, particularly in the Medicare Advantage program and establishing a board to make recommendations about future savings. But he has not outlined a dramatic, structural overhaul or a fundamental redefinition of the program.

We found that Romney was stringing together a series of flimsy and often contradictory facts to justify an over-the-top statement. Let's take Romney's points one by one:

Is Medicare going bankrupt?

As PolitiFact Georgia has written -- and as Medicare’s government trustees declare every year -- Medicare does have big financial problems.

Medicare is funded by two separate trust funds run by the federal government. According to the most recent annual report of the Medicare trustees, the trust fund for Medicare Part B, which covers doctors visits and outpatient costs, and part D, which covers prescription drugs,  is in reasonably good shape, though not without longer-term worries.

The other trust fund, covering inpatient hospital care, home health care and services at skilled nursing facilities and hospices, is under greater fiscal stress. Tax income and dedicated revenues ""are expected to fall short"" of expenditures ""in all future years,"" the trustees wrote. The fund doesn't meet overall benchmarks for fiscal balance in either the short or the long term. The fund is expected to be exhausted by 2024, or possibly as soon as 2016 in a worst-case scenario.

Still, not even this grim outlook translates into Obama ""allowing (Medicare) to go bankrupt in less than 15 years,"" as the Romney memo claims.

First, it is a significant exaggeration to blame Medicare's situation entirely on the incumbent president. Decisions over nearly 50 years by many presidents and members of Congress have put the program on an unsustainable path. You could just as easily substitute the name of a Republican president or a GOP congressional leader who would have to share at least some responsibility for the financial situation.

The Medicare trustees don’t use the word ""bankrupt"" in their report, and it’s not clear that Medicare’s situation fits the two definitions of ""bankrupt"" we’ve used in the past -- to be ""declared in law unable to pay outstanding debts"" or ""reduced to a state of financial ruin: impoverished."" Medicare is a government program; the government will have the ability to pay its bills, however financially painful that may become.

Meanwhile, only one of the funds is considered in fiscal peril, and that peril could be headed off through benefit cuts or higher taxes.

Historically, Congress has intervened when funds appeared to be running out. ""Almost from its inception, the (Part A) trust fund has faced a projected shortfall,"" the Congressional Research Service has written. In 1970, the insolvency date was 1972. For the next 16 years, trustees expected its funds to be exhausted by the 1990s. Congress repeatedly acted to lower fund spending and keep it from going dry.

Overall, we find it is a ridiculous exaggeration to say that Obama is personally responsible for Medicare's financial woes.  
Is Obama funding his health care law by $500 billion in Medicare cuts?

First off, we’ll note that this argument is an odd contradiction. In the first point, Romney argued that Obama is responsible for Medicare's financial peril. This one criticizes him for ... cutting its costs.

We previously checked a virtually identical claim by Romney, that ""Obamacare takes $500 billion out of Medicare and funds Obamacare."" We ruled it Half True, though other times we’ve given different ratings to this general topic due to variations in how the claim was worded.

The health care reform law made several changes to Medicare. In a few cases, it actually increased Medicare spending to provide more benefits and coverage. The law added money to cover preventive services and to fill a gap (or ""doughnut hole"") for enrollees who purchase prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program.

Other provisions are designed to reduce future growth in Medicare spending, to encourage the program to operate more efficiently and to improve the delivery and quality of care in ways that include reducing hospital re-admissions. The bill doesn't take money out of the current Medicare budget but instead attempts to slow the program's future growth in provider payments, combined with premium hikes for higher-income beneficiaries and administrative changes.

Medicare spending will still increase, however. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009.

Romney is right that future savings from Medicare are planned to offset new costs created by the law -- especially coverage for the uninsured -- so that the overall law doesn't add to the deficit. However, the way Romney phrases it gives the impression that the law takes money already allocated to Medicare and uses it to fund the new health care law. Instead, the law uses a number of measures to try to reduce the rapid growth of future Medicare spending -- something that, paradoxically, would help ease the concerns laid out in Romney’s previous claim, that Medicare could ""go bankrupt in less than 15 years.""

So that doesn't support the sweeping claim that Obama is ""changing Medicare as we know it."" He's changed it, but not drastically.

Does the health care law create an ""unaccountable board to ration care""?

The Independent Payment Advisory Board, or IPAB, with 15 members who are political appointees, is charged with identifying $15.5 billion in Medicare savings. PolitiFact and its affiliates have checked similar claims and typically found they were significant exaggerations.

Here, we’ll first ask: Is IPAB unaccountable? The answer is: No.

Members are chosen by the president and confirmed by the Senate. The board would not issue edicts. It would make recommendations. If Congress does not act on its recommendations within a set time, the recommendations are automatically implemented.

But Congress has other opportunities to intervene. According to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis, the full House and Senate may consider amendments that change or repeal the board's recommendations as long as those changes meet the same fiscal criteria as the board itself uses. Congress is even granted a one-time opportunity to introduce legislation to dismantle IPAB permanently. This would require approval between January 2017 and Aug. 15, 2017, with the support of three-fifths of the members of the House and Senate.

So Congress has multiple ways to intervene. This negates the argument that its actions are ""unaccountable.""

Second, would IPAB ration care? No. The law specifically bars it from doing that. The panel is forbidden from submitting ""any recommendation to ration health care,"" according to Section 3403 of the health care law.

The types of recommendations the board is permitted to make are also sharply limited. It may not suggest raising premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The board also may not urge changes to Medicare eligibility, the scope of benefits or initiatives to raise revenue.

Instead, what it is permitted to do is reduce how much the government pays health-care providers for services, for instance, by reducing payments to hospitals with high rates of re-admissions or recommending innovations to cut wasteful spending.

The Romney campaign argues that IPAB’s actions will have the effect of rationing care. If the reimbursement rate for mammograms is cut low enough, the campaign argues, doctors would face the choice of continuing to provide the same services for diminishing payments or else stop providing the services entirely.

But as we’ve argued before, if that’s rationing, then it’s not substantially different from the type of unofficial rationing that existed before passage of the health care law (and continues to exist today, before much of it is in force). People who couldn't get health insurance due to a pre-existing condition or their financial situation felt like there was already rationing. And even for those with insurance, not every type of care was covered.

""Everyone hates the word rationing,"" Katherine Baicker, a health economics professor at Harvard University, told us in 2009. ""From an economics perspective, there's no way around rationing. Some care is being rationed now. Everyone isn't getting everything.""  

So, IPAB doesn’t break any new ground in ""rationing,"" and the board is still accountable to Congress.

Is Obama destroying Medicare Advantage?

The health care law includes $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program -- a privately run, Medicare-funded plan akin to managed care health insurance.

The Romney camp points to a study that supports the argument that these changes will destroy Medicare Advantage. It projects that ""nationwide, compared to what would have been the case under prior law, by 2017, when the changes are fully phased-in, enrollment (in Medicare Advantage) is projected to be 50 percent lower, the average would-be beneficiary will lose $3,700 in benefits (accounting for both those who remain in MA and those who leave) and the number of choices available in the average county will be reduced by about two-thirds.""

We don’t have any contrary data, but we’ll note that the report was written by Robert A. Book, a former scholar at the conservative Heritage Foundation, and Michael Ramlet, the director of health care policy at the American Action Forum, a group whose board includes a long list of Republican stalwarts. So we think the report is worth taking with a grain of salt.

There’s no question that Medicare Advantage is taking a disproportionate share of the cuts made by the new law. But ""destroying"" is too strong a word -- few doubt that Medicare Advantage will continue to exist and draw beneficiaries. And these savings need to be taken in some context.

""The Affordable Care Act reduces payments to Medicare Advantage plans,"" Jonathan Oberlander, health policy professor at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine, told us in 2011. ""They’re overpaid by quite a lot -- excess payments above and beyond what it costs to treat people,"" he said. ""As a result of that, there are projections that some of those (plans) are going to trim some of the extra benefits."" Those could include benefits for vision or dental care, he said, but ""it doesn’t affect the core benefits, the required Medicare benefits.""

And once again, we’ll point out that if Romney is concerned about Medicare possibly going ""bankrupt"" in the future, it’s paradoxical to simultaneously argue against lowering reimbursements to a portion of Medicare that is already paid higher-than-average amounts.

Is Obama ending access to care for today’s seniors?

This is a stunningly sweeping claim, with virtually nothing to back it up. Are Medicare beneficiaries really being left without any doctors or hospitals to go to?

The campaign points to a projection by Medicare’s actuary that one provision in the law could squeeze health care reimbursements so much that about 15 percent of health care providers ""could find it difficult to remain profitable and, absent legislative intervention, might end their participation in the program (possibly jeopardizing access to care for beneficiaries),"" the actuary wrote.

Coming from an independent federal official, this assessment seems credible. But health care experts -- while acknowledging the risks of squeezing providers -- caution against concluding that many of Medicare’s providers will flee the program.

One reason is Medicare’s market dominance. ""If hospitals don’t serve Medicare patients, who exactly are they going to care for?"" Oberlander asks. ""Same goes for most physicians. Without Medicare patients, they would have very empty waiting rooms.""

History backs up this view, said Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology health care policy specialist who has advised both Romney and Obama in the past.

""We have seen major cuts in Medicare reimbursement in the past, most notably for hospitals in 1997, where there were cuts that were much larger than those in"" Obama’s law, yet none resulted in widespread defections, Gruber said.

It’s also worth noting that the new law is not the only source of cost adjustments that could squeeze margins for providers. The most notable is Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate, which (at least theoretically) caps physician reimbursement in the program based on a formula. We say ""theoretical"" because Congress has always acted to head off its implementation before the required cuts took effect. And that's been going on since it was first put into law in 1997.

""This would have been a problem regardless of whether the ACA ever became law, so connecting it to ‘Obamacare’ is just false,"" Oberlander said.

Summing up

We’ll evaluate Romney’s claim in two steps. First, how accurate are his five claims? And second, do they collectively indicate that Obama is ""ending Medicare as we know it""?

The claim that Obama is funding his health care law by $500 billion in Medicare cuts has the most merit, but three of the other claims greatly exaggerate a nugget of truth.

Medicare has serious financial challenges in its future, but saying it will go ""bankrupt"" in less than 15 years is highly misleading. Meanwhile, Obama’s law certainly targets Medicare Advantage for cuts, but it’s not at all clear that those cuts will ""destroy"" the program. And Medicare’s fiscal pressures and the possibility of reduced payments to providers do pose challenges for Medicare’s ability to keep physicians and hospitals in its network, but its sheer size gives it market power that make it difficult for physicians to leave.

As for Romney’s claim about IPAB, we see little if any truth in it.

Our ruling

Overall, then, the Romney news release is a talking point in search of facts.

It takes some shreds of truth and combines them with worst-case-scenario speculations, then deploys overheated language. Even if each of his five claims were true, it would be a stretch to say that they added up to ""ending Medicare as we know it."" But given their degree of inaccuracy, the memo doesn’t have a leg to stand on.

We interpret ""ending Medicare as we know it"" to mean a fundamental, structural change to the program, one so significant that it is almost unrecognizable as a result. Romney’s charge that Obama would ""end Medicare as we know it"" is at least as overheated as the Democratic charge that the Ryan plan would ""end Medicare.""

Under Obama’s approach, Medicare would still be a large, single-payer, federally run health care program for seniors -- slimmer in some areas, more generous in others, with a smattering of different rules. That’s not ""ending Medicare as we know it,"" which is just the latest line in a long history of political attempts to scare seniors. We rate Romney’s claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AD64C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/22/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-barack-obama-ending-medicare-we-k/
"['Oregon', 'Human Rights', 'Jefferson Smith']","
Did a human trafficking bill lead to dozens of hotline calls?
","
Last November Portland mayoral candidate and state Rep. Jefferson Smith sat down with Portland Monthly magazine to talk about his candidacy and the future of the city. He opened the discussion with a list of some of his legislative accomplishments, including this one:

""We got a chance to pass what I think is Oregon's first human trafficking bill, which has increased by 66 percent the calls to the human trafficking hotline.""

Smith was referencing a bill that passed in the February 2010 special session. Essentially the law asked the Oregon Liquor Control Commission to send out a letter highlighting the issue of human trafficking with each license renewal notice. The letter included a sticker that bar owners and others could post directing people to a hotline run by the National Human Trafficking Resource Center.

The bill was a start, but we wondered if it really had the effect of increasing calls to the hotline by 66 percent.

We called the OLCC first to get a handle on just how the law ended up playing out. Spokeswoman Joy Spencer told us the organization sent notices to just over 10,000 licensees between April 2010 and March 2011. The program has since ended.

Next, we checked with the hotline to see how Smith’s numbers panned out. Thankfully, the Polaris Project, which runs the hotline, made this pretty easy for us. The project publishes yearly statistics on the hotline, which has been up and running since 2007. The statistics are incredibly comprehensive. They show where the calls are coming from -- down to the county level -- along with the caller’s language, profession if disclosed, and the way they learned about the hotline.

We did some quick math and found Smith was right. Between 2009 and 2010, the number of calls coming from Oregon increased 66 percent, jumping from 95 to 158. Even more impressively, that trend continued into 2011, when the hotline received 191 calls. That’s a 20 percent increase from the previous year.

The figures, though, are always the easy part. Smith was clearly claiming a causation between the increase in the calls and the bill he helped pass. For that, however, there wasn’t much evidence.

As Megan Fowler, spokeswoman for the Polaris Project pointed out, the hotline has been seeing the same trend nationwide. Between 2009 and 2010, the number of calls nationally rose from 7,637 to 11,874, a 55 percent increase. In 2011, the number hit 19,427 -- a 63 percent increase.

What’s more, if you look at where most people in Oregon found the hotline number, the biggest sources are the Internet or ""prior knowledge."" Few people came by ways of posters or other materials. A number of callers -- 24 percent in 2010 and 33 percent the following year -- didn’t specify where they got the number.

However, that seems to run somewhat counter to Fowler’s experience with Texas where, she said, the Legislature made a law mandating that establishments put up a poster referring people to the hotline. There, she said, a huge number of callers cited ""posters"" as their informational source.

""We definitely encourage actions like"" Oregon’s law, Fowler said. ""We do see greater success when the bill is a mandatory posting. But I wouldn't want to dissuade people from putting the hotline number out.""

We called Smith to check in with him on the statement. He immediately said that to draw a direct relationship between the hotline gains and his bill was an overstep on his part. He also pointed out that in more recent references, he’s been more humble in what the bill accomplished.

Part of the reason, Smith said, is that since the discussion in November he’s had more time to look at the figures and realized the connection wasn’t as strong as he initially expected. ""I don't think that (the quote) accurately reflects the way we typically talk about it.""

Smith followed up by sending us a few copies of a list of legislative achievements he’s since distributed. Here’s how he usually plays the human trafficking law: ""Chief Co-sponsor of the Human Trafficking Hotline bill -- one of Oregon’s first pieces of human trafficking legislation. Chief Co-sponsor of HB 4146, providing for the expungement of sex trafficking victims. Calls from Oregon to the national hotline have reportedly increased by 66-68%.""

""I try to be very careful not to say ‘because’ -- because I rarely can be confident of ‘because,’"" Smith wrote.

It’s true that in his more recent statements, Smith doesn’t make an explicitly causal relationship. But even so, it’s implied.

That brings us to our ruling. The number of calls to the hotline has increased significantly over the past couple years -- even more so than the 66 percent Smith cites if you consider the 2011 figures. That said, there’s not much evidence that Oregon’s ""hotline law"" was the driving force. Nationally, the figures are up by about the same degree and most callers don’t report that they found out about the hotline by way of a poster or other such material.

We rate this claim Mostly False -- there’s a grain of truth, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C258940>],/factchecks/2012/mar/22/jefferson-smith/did-human-trafficking-bill-lead-dozens-hotline-cal/

State college president claims New Jersey experiences a net loss of 30,000 students a year
","
The president of Montclair State University said one fact illuminates the problems with the state’s higher education system: many New Jersey students attend college elsewhere. 
Susan Cole recently appeared on NJTV where she argued that the state has failed to invest in the higher education infrastructure, including buildings and faculty, needed to make New Jersey competitive and economically prosperous.

Asked in the March 13 interview how far the state is from where it needs to be in this area, Cole said: ""The gap is huge and it is most evident if you look at the net out-migration of students from New Jersey. New Jersey loses net, that is minus those who come into the state, 30,000 students a year. That's every year, year after year, 30,000 of our best prepared, most educated students leave the state for other states.""

Are tens of thousands of college students leaving the Garden State? Yes.

A report released last year by the New Jersey Higher Education Task Force, a committee appointed by Gov. Chris Christie, said: ""In part because of a lack of college capacity, New Jersey has a too-long history of losing more college-bound students than attend in-state.""

The National Center for Education Statistics, a research arm of the U.S. Department of Education, keeps tabs on where students choose to pursue education after high school.

In fall 2008, the most recent data available, 36,135 New Jersey residents enrolled for the first time in an out-of-state institution granting at least an associate’s degree. At the same time 5,268 first-time freshmen came to New Jersey, for a net loss of 30,867 students.

Diane Reed, a spokeswoman for Montclair State University, confirmed that’s the data Cole was referencing in the television interview.

In comparison, New Jersey lost a net total of 29,559 of first-time freshmen in fall 2006. A decade before that the state lost 20,005 students.

The National Center for Education Statistics also narrows the data to focus on freshmen who graduated high school in the last year and freshmen attending a four-year institution who graduated high school in the last year.

Both groups experienced a net loss of students close to the figure Cole cited.

New Jersey lost a net total of 27,819 freshmen who graduated high school in the last year and 27,343 freshmen attending four-year institutions who graduated high school in the last year, according to the most recent data.

By all three measures, more students left New Jersey then came to the state in the fall of 2008 for a postsecondary education than any other state in the nation.  

Our ruling

The president of Montclair State University said: ""New Jersey loses net, that is minus those who come into the state, 30,000 students a year.""

According to the most recent federal education statistics, 36,135 first-time freshmen students left New Jersey and 5,268 came to the state. That’s a net loss of 30,867.

And when narrowing  the data to freshmen who graduated in the  past 12 months or students attending four-year institutions, the net loss is still more than 27,000 students.

Cole’s on the mark with this statement. We rate it True.

"['Environment', 'Ohio', 'Recreation', 'Water', 'Marcy Kaptur']","
Rep. Marcy Kaptur says Lake Erie has more native fish than all other Great Lakes combined
","
With a newly reconfigured congressional district that stretches along Lake Erie between Toledo and Cleveland, it’s not surprising that U.S. Rep. Marcy Kaptur would be one of Lake Erie’s biggest boosters.

Late last month, the Toledo Democrat  marked Great Lakes Week on Capitol Hill with a speech on the House of Representatives floor that discussed the need to prevent voracious Asian carp from entering the Great Lakes and threatening its $7 billion fishing industry. She declared that no lake is more important than Lake Erie, noting that it has the Great Lakes’ largest fishery.

Lake Erie ""contains more native fish than all the other lakes combined,"" Kaptur said. ""We must protect this valuable ecological treasure, and the local multi-billion dollar economy it supports.""

Kaptur’s boast about Lake Erie containing ""more native fish than all the other lakes combined"" sounded like it might be a fish story, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out.

We consulted Ohio Sea Grant College Program Director Jeffrey M. Reutter, an expert on Lake Erie. He said Kaptur’s statement is largely correct, although there are caveats. He said that Lake Erie always produces more fish than any of the other Great Lakes, and invariably outstrips Lakes Ontario, Huron and Superior combined. Occasionally Lake Michigan produces enough fish so that its total, when added to the other three, exceeds the total produced by Lake Erie. He also said that some of the fish that populate the lakes - such as common carp, as well as salmon and trout that have been stocked in Lakes Michigan and Huron, are not native species.

""The point I am a little unsure of is the native vs. non-native portion,"" he said. ""That is a hard one to state accurately because, for example, the common carp, which is very abundant just about everywhere, is not technically a native species and the large salmonid fishery on Lake Michigan is not native.""

He said that Lake Superior contains 40 to 50 percent of the water in the Great Lakes, but just 2 percent of the fish. Lake Erie contains just 2 percent of the water, and 50 percent of the fish. He said Lake Erie produces more fish than the other lakes because it is the farthest south, the shallowest, and therefore the warmest lake. Lake Erie also is surrounded by farms and urban residential areas that stream nutrients into its waters. The nutrients feed algae and zooplankton, which feed Lake Erie’s fish. Lake Superior is deeper, colder, and is largely surrounded by forests, so it gets fewer nutrients produced by human intervention and produces fewer fish.

""Personally, I would say that she is arguably correct in her statement and let it go,"" said Reutter. ""Congresswoman Kaptur has heard me speak on Lake Erie many times and I am sure she is attempting to accurately repeat something she has heard from me. I would say it’s close enough to be OK.""

Ohio Department of Natural Resources fisheries biology supervisor Jeff Tyson confirmed Reutter’s observations, noting that the sport and commercial walleye and yellow perch fisheries in Lake Erie far exceed the harvestable fish in the other lakes. White bass, white perch, rainbow smelt, freshwater drum and channel catfish are also found in Lake Erie.

Tyson noted that isolated specimens of the Asian carp that Kaptur fears could devastate the Great Lakes have already been found in Lake Erie, most recently in 2003. He said those fish were probably put into its waters  as part of a tradition among Asians, in which two live fish are purchased, and one is eaten and the other is released for good luck.

""We think these were isolated incidents and have no evidence of an established population,"" said Tyson.

Tyson said that Asian carp eat huge amounts of the same plankton consumed by larval walleye, so their introduction would hurt the walleye’s ability to compete.

A Michigan Sea Grant Extension study of Great Lakes Commercial Fisheries bears out Kaptur’s contention that Lake Erie produces more fish than the other lakes combined, although it did not break out native vs. non-native species. In the year it examined - 2000 - it  found that the Great Lakes produced 46.7 million pounds of fish. Of that total, 26.1 million pounds came from Lake Erie, about 56 percent of the total. Lake Erie’s haul included roughly 7 million pounds each of walleye and smelt, 4.4 million pounds of yellow perch, 3.4 million pounds of white bass, and more than a million pounds each of carp and lake whitefish.

The Great Lakes Fishery Commission also keeps data on the amount of fish produced in each of the Great Lakes. In 2005, the most recent year for which complete data is posted on its website, Lake Erie’s fish production exceeded that of the combined other lakes by a 3-to-2 margin.

There’s no doubt that Kaptur is correct in her overall point that Lake Erie has by far the most productive fishery on the Great Lakes. Her contention that Lake Erie contains more native fish than the other lakes combined is slightly problematic. It’s true that the fishing haul in Lake Erie usually exceeds the combined total of the other lakes. But some fish that are commercial staples in the Great Lakes are not considered ""native"" because they were introduced from other areas, although their presence isn’t as unwelcome and devastating as invaders like zebra mussels have been, and Asian carp would be.

David Dewhurst says gas costs $4.50 a gallon
","
Ahead of President Barack Obama’s fundraising turn in Texas this month, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, a Republican U.S. Senate candidate, poked at the president by saying that ""Texans know three numbers that Obama would like to forget.""

Dewhurst’s March 8, 2012, email blast said the numbers are:

""1. $15.5 trillion in national debt
2. $4.50 per gallon gasoline
3. 1.2 million fewer jobs since Obama took office.""

The email reflects the current size of the national debt, according to the U.S. Treasury. And one set of employment data by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics indicates that more than 1.2 million fewer Americans were employed in February 2012 compared to December 2008, the month before Obama became president.

But $4.50-a-gallon gas? We sought backup.

By email, Dewhurst spokesman Matt Hirsch told us a Dairy Mart in Lewisville, Texas, was charging $4.50 a gallon. We were unable to verify that.

Hirsch also pointed out a Feb. 28, 2012, ABC News online post, headlined ""Gas Prices: 25 Most Expensive Cities,"" quoting figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration indicating that the average price of gasoline nationwide rose to $3.72 a gallon that week -- and had surpassed $4.25 a gallon in a dozen California cities.

The post quotes Jason Toews, a co-founder of GasBuddy.com, which tracks prices at gas stations, saying: ""California typically has higher gas prices due to the special blend of gas mandated by the state. This blend of gas burns more cleanly for pollution control.""

GasBuddy.com also listed the 25 highest gas prices nationally, topped by $4.35 a gallon in Santa Barbara, Calif. At No. 25 was Bridgeport, Conn., at nearly $3.96. No Texas cities made the list.

So, gas was costing up to $4.35 a gallon in a California city before Dewhurst aired his figure.

For broader perspective, we turned to an EIA web page, Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update, which offers weekly average price updates for all kinds of motor fuel. And according to provided historical information, the average U.S. price across six grades and formulations of gas -- regular, mid-grade and premium types -- the week of March 5, 2012, when Dewhurst sent his blast, was $3.85 a gallon, ranging from an average of $3.28 in Denver to $4.46 in Los Angeles. The Texas average was $3.67.

Hirsch, Dewhurst’s spokesman, pointed out that certain average gas prices have been $4.50 or more. In the week of March 5, 2012, according to EIA, the average price of mid-grade gas, defined by its mid-level anti-knock or octane rating, of all formulations in Los Angeles was nearly $4.51 a gallon; the average price for the same kind in San Francisco was $4.46. The national average was $3.92 while the Texas average was $3.76.

The same week, the average Los Angeles price for reformulated (or less-polluting) premium gas, which has a higher octane rating than mid-grade or regular gas, was $4.57 a gallon, a penny more than the average price for such gas in San Francisco. The average Texas price was $3.92 a gallon.

Nationally, the EIA says, the average price of all grades and formulations of gas has been more than $3 a gallon since Dec. 6, 2010. It’s been more than $2 a gallon since March 23, 2009. In Texas, gas of all grades and formulations topped out at an average price of $3.91 a gallon the week of May 12, 2011.

Finally, Dewhurst’s statement about gas prices suggests Obama is responsible for increasing gas prices when a president’s impact on those prices is limited. John B. Townsend II, a spokesman for the mid-Atlantic region of the American Automobile Association, told PolitiFact in September 2011 that ""other than lip service, there is little any president or member of Congress can do about the price of gas, since 70 percent of the cost of a gallon is determined by the cost of crude oil.""

Our ruling

So, $4.50 a gallon? Sure, you can find that price if you look hard enough -- especially if you’re driving California. But Dewhurst’s comment implies that $4.50 gas is commonplace. That’s an exaggeration. Average gas prices were 15 to 20 percent lower in the week when Dewhurst blasted Obama, who also doesn’t control the price of gas.

We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809732CDC0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/22/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-gas-costs-450-gallon/
"['Abortion', 'National', 'Health Care', 'Bloggers']","
Does Barack Obama's health care bill include $1 abortions?
","
Many readers have asked us to review a recent claim reverberating around the Internet that stems from an article posted on an anti-abortion website, lifenews.com. The March 12, 2012, article is titled, ""Obama Admin Finalizes Rules: $1 Abortions in ObamaCare."" 
Referring to a rule recently issued by the Department of Health and Human Services, lifenews.com published the following: 
""It’s official. The concern pro-life organizations had about the ObamaCare legislation funding abortions has been confirmed, as the Obama administration has issued the final rules on abortion funding governing the controversial health care law. Nestled within the ‘individual mandate’ in the Obamacare act — that portion of the Act requiring every American to purchase government-approved insurance or pay a penalty — is an ‘abortion premium mandate.’ This mandate requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion. As a result, many pro-life Americans will have to decide between a plan that violates their consciences by funding abortion, or a plan that may not meet their health needs."" 
We’ll look at whether the Obama administration has issued rules for ""$1 abortions in ObamaCare"" and required ""all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion."" (We emailed lifenews.com but did not hear back.) 
As we’ve noted before, abortion has been a thorny issue in the process of drafting and enacting a health care law from the beginning. 
Since 1976, the federal government has been guided by the Hyde Amendment, a law that prohibits the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's life is in peril. Due to that amendment -- which must be renewed every year -- abortion services are not provided in health care plans offered to federal employees and for active and retired military. 
But the health care reform bill set up health care ""exchanges"" in which private insurance companies can compete for the business of buyers who do not get their insurance through an employer. The question became: Should private companies be allowed to offer abortion coverage (as most already do) when operating through the exchanges? And what if the people buying policies are getting government subsidies to buy insurance? 
The final rules from HHS don’t dramatically alter the approach taken by the law itself. 
For starters, when the exchanges begin operating in 2014, some states will ban all abortion coverage entirely for any plan selling on that state’s exchange. Doing so is allowed by a state ""opt-out"" clause that was passed as part of the health care law. According to the National Right to Life Committee, 15 states have passed such laws so far, with other legislatures considering similar measures. 
Beyond that, every state must offer at least one plan on its exchange that doesn’t cover abortion, and that plan will include the same minimum benefit package for non-abortion services that is required of every other plan sold on the exchanges. In addition, no private insurer will be forced to cover abortion; doing so will be their choice, at least in states that choose to allow it. 
However, unless and until opt-out laws are passed by the other 35 states, insurers will be allowed to sell policies on the exchanges that include abortion coverage. To allow this yet still abide by the Hyde Amendment, sponsors of the bill drafted a special procedure to differentiate between dollars spent on abortion coverage and dollars spent for everything else. (Anti-abortion advocates have consistently argued that the approach doesn’t offer strong enough protections to prevent taxpayer funding of abortion. More on that later.) 
Any insurer offering a plan on the exchange that includes abortion coverage must set up two separate accounts for dollars received and paid. One account would hold money that is used to pay for abortion services (except for abortions that are the result of rape, incest, or to protect the life of the mother, which may be paid for under the Hyde Amendment). The other account would hold money that is used to pay for everything else. 
All federal dollars, such as federal subsidies received by purchasers on the exchange whose incomes are low enough to qualify for them, would be deposited in the non-abortion account. Most of the premiums paid by the plan’s beneficiaries would also go into this account, but a fraction of individual premium payments would be sent to the abortion account, so that enough money is available to pay for claims submitted by beneficiaries for abortion services. 
The Obama administration has issued rules for ""$1 abortions in ObamaCare"" 
So where does that $1figure come from? 
HHS has determined the minimum amount that insurers offering plans that include abortion must allocate per beneficiary into this abortion account. An insurer ""may not estimate such a cost at less than $1 per enrollee, per month,"" HHS said. 
That’s where it comes from. But what does it mean? 
It means that a plan cannot contribute less than $1of premiums per month per beneficiary into the abortion fund. That’s all. It doesn’t mean that abortions will cost one dollar -- which seems an obvious interpretation of the phrase ""$1 abortions in ObamaCare."" Rather, it’s a way of filling the account so that there’s enough money to pay abortion providers for their services. The actual amount per enrollee per month may be a lot higher, depending on what the insurer’s actuaries determine. 
So the claim of ""$1 abortions"" is ridiculously inaccurate. What about the second claim? 
The law ""requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion."" 
This claim echoes many made by anti-abortion advocates since the law was first proposed. Critics argue that the health care law’s protections against taxpayer dollars being used to fund abortions are inadequate. 
""The most objectionable aspect is that it is a smokescreen intended to conceal the new and massive federal subsidies (‘tax credits’) to health plans that cover abortion on demand -- a sharp break from decades of federal policy,"" said Douglas Johnson, legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee. ""Under Medicaid and the Federal Employee Health Benefits program, for example, federal funds do not go to plans that cover elective abortions."" 
But let’s parse the lifenews.com statement closely. 
For starters, it refers to ""all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion services"" -- but the issue at hand actually affects only persons who purchased insurance from the exchanges. According to the Congressional Budget Office, by 2018, there will be 24 million people buying insurance through the exchanges, compared to 184 million people with either employer-provided insurance or individually purchased insurance outside the exchanges. 
So the maximum number of people theoretically affected by this concern is 12 percent of private-insurance beneficiaries in 2018. And that number could decline substantially once you subtract residents of the 15 states (or more) that bar any abortion coverage in exchange-sold policies, and after you subtract those individuals that purchase one of the non-abortion options required to be offered by the exchanges. This group falls well short of ""all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion."" 
But even this is a side issue. We have ruled in the past that the health care law does not provide federal funding for abortion. Our conclusion was that even if you have the opportunity to buy abortion coverage on the exchanges -- and Americans in many states won’t have that option -- you won’t be forced to buy such coverage. Non-abortion options will always be available on the exchanges, and tax dollars sent to those plans through federal subsidies will be placed in accounts walled off from accounts used to pay for abortion services. 
This all means that anyone purchasing a plan with abortion coverage will be be doing so by choice and paying for it personally. 
On March 16, 2012, Johnson, of the National Right to Life Committee, and his colleague, senior legislative counsel Susan T. Muskett, raised an issue about the way the law is worded. They wrote that ""if a health plan covers abortion, the rule forbids the plan from calling attention to that fact in any of its advertising or explanatory materials. The disclosure of abortion coverage can be provided ‘only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment.’ This provision seems designed for no other purpose than to ensure that many people who would not deliberately sign up for abortion-covering plans will do so inadvertently."" 
The text of the law does include this line: ""A qualified health plan that provides for coverage of (elective abortion) shall provide a notice to enrollees, only as part of the summary of benefits and coverage explanation, at the time of enrollment, of such coverage."" 
This use of the word ""only"" does seem to raise the risk that a plan’s abortion provisions won’t be fully transparent to the buyer. But we think the law does ensure disclosure for any potential purchaser who is paying attention. 
HHS describes the disclosure summary in question as something akin to the nutritional labels on food -- a standardized form that will allow consumers to easily compare one plan’s features to another’s before they buy. 
""Before choosing a health plan, consumers will know whether the plan covers these services,"" said HHS spokeswoman Erin Shields. 
Our ruling 
The claim that the Obama administration has issued rules for ""$1 abortions in ObamaCare"" is ridiculous; the administration has simply set a floor for how much money per month of the premiums paid by those who have chosen plans that include abortion must be placed in a segregated account in order to make sure that there’s enough money available to pay for abortion services incurred by people enrolled in that plan. 
The bigger charge -- that the Obama health care law ""requires all persons enrolled in insurance plans that include elective abortion coverage to pay a separate premium from their own pockets to fund abortion"" -- is also incorrect. 
The provision in question only affects people who purchase insurance plans that cover abortion and who do so on the exchanges -- a much narrower group than the claim suggests. And people who make such purchases will be paying their private dollars into abortion coverage accounts voluntarily. Despite some puzzling wording, ultimately the law allows for full disclosure of its abortion rules at the most obvious time, when someone is signing up for coverage. On balance, we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C177C0>],/factchecks/2012/mar/21/blog-posting/does-barack-obamas-health-care-bill-include-1-abor/
