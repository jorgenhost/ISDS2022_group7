U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says incumbent Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a $525-billion tax hike on the middle class
","
Did U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who characterizes himself as a champion of the middle class, vote for a $525-billion tax increase on that group?
 
That's one assertion in a television ad by Republican challenger Barry Hinckley.

After raising an allegation about insider trading, which Whitehouse has strongly denied, the commercial says ""Whitehouse voted to raise taxes on middle-class families."" The phrase ""$525 billion tax increase on the middle class"" flashes on the screen.

The commercial offers no further information about what Hinckley is talking about, so we asked the Hinckley campaign for its backup.

Campaign manager Patrick Sweeney said the ad refers to the Affordable Care Act, the health care plan often known as Obamacare, which Whitehouse supported. PolitiFact has examined similar claims, including one in which Hinckley declared that the law will ""add trillions of dollars in debt,"" a claim we ruled False.

The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation, designed to expand health coverage, will generate $525 billion in revenue. A lower estimate by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation predicted it will bring in more than $437.8 billion. Sweeney said the ad is using the CBO estimate.

But there are a few significant facts the ad doesn't mention.

First, that's not money raised over one year. It's over 10 years, from 2010 through 2019 for legislation that is being gradually phased in. In 2019, annual revenue is expected to have risen to $88.2 billion.

Second, most of the money won't be coming from the middle class, as the ad states.

For example, a huge chunk of the revenue, $210 billion of the $437.8 billion in the Joint Committee estimate, comes from both a higher Medicare payroll tax to be paid by individuals earning more than $200,000 a year ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) and from a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income if your income is already high.

Those take effect in 2013 and are taxes that middle class families will not see.

Other taxes aren't geared to the middle class either, although all taxpayers may have to foot the bill indirectly as the extra costs are factored into the goods and services they buy.

They include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers (which will raise an estimated $27 billion); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion); and a fee on health insurance providers ($60.1 billion).

In addition, there's the excise tax on indoor tanning services (expected to raise $2.7 billion) and the stricter limit on deducting medical expenses on tax returns, which is expected to raise $15.2 billion. Both will have a more direct effect on the well-tanned or very-ill middle class.

One other element of the law that will affect the middle class is the provision of Obamacare known as the individual mandate. It requires people to pay an annual penalty if they don't buy health insurance. It takes effect in 2014, starting off at a minimum of $95 for an individual and rising to $695 per year in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld that controversial provision by characterizing it as a tax, not a penalty.

Is this a tax/penalty on the middle class?

The CBO, the source used by the Hinckley campaign, has estimated that by 2016, 55 percent of the money collected via the individual mandate will come from people with incomes in the top 20 percent, which is a family of four making roughly $120,000 or more.

So less than half the money will be coming from middle class Americans.

How much money is involved?

About $4 billion in 2016. The amount coming from the middle class and lower class: roughly $1.8 billion.

To put that in perspective, $1.8 billion is 3 percent of the $57 billion or so Obamacare will be raising from everyone in 2016.

Our ruling

Barry Hinckley said Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a ""$525 billion tax increase on the middle class.""

The ad doesn't say that it's really talking about Obamacare, and that the money is designed to help pay for health coverage for the uninsured, many of whom are in the middle class.

It also doesn't point out that the $525 billion is spread out over 10 years, through 2019. Most of it doesn't come from the middle class.  

And of the $4 billion the government expects to collect each year from people who choose not to purchase health insurance, less than half will come from the middle class.

The claim in the Hinckley ad is so ridiculously off base, we rate it Pants on Fire!

Obama says Romney would spend $2 trillion that the military hasn't asked for
","
Republican nominee Mitt Romney has said he plans to increase defense spending by about $2 trillion over the next 10 years if he’s elected president. In the final debate of the campaign, moderator Bob Scheiffer asked Romney, ""Where are you going to get the money?""

Romney said he would take it from other parts of the budget -- by abolishing Obamacare and by changing Medicaid to a block grant and turning it over to the states.

President Barack Obama said Romney’s plan for more defense spending is a bad idea, because it isn’t necessary. Romney ""wants to spend another $2 trillion on military spending that our military is not asking for,"" Obama said.

In this fact-check, we examine the claim that Romney is promoting something the top brass don’t want.

Romney has outlined out his national security policy on his website. There, he warned that restoring the military ""will not be a cost-free process,"" and said he will ""begin by reversing Obama-era defense cuts ... with the goal of setting core defense spending — meaning funds devoted to the fundamental military components of personnel, operations and maintenance, procurement, and research and development — at a floor of 4 percent of GDP.""

 What’s 4 percent worth?

The Pentagon’s budget is expected to run in the range of 3.2 to 3.5 percent of GDP in the next fiscal year. According to the Center for a New American Security, a group with ties to both Republican and Democratic administrations, even a gradual ramp up to 4 percent would increase defense spending by $2.1 trillion over the next ten years, as reported by CNN.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group focused on deficit reduction, uses that number too, as do other budget think tanks. Romney seems to accept it, so as far as the $2 trillion figure goes, it seems reasonably accurate.

In the past, when asked about increasing defense spending in tough economic times, the Romney campaign has emphasized that the 4-percent goal will take some time to achieve.

While the campaign website describes the goal as ""a floor"", campaign spokesperson Andrea Saul called it ""a target"" in an email to a Boston Globe reporter. The first priority, Saul wrote, is to reverse ""Obama-era defense cuts.""

In the same article, one Romney adviser, Mackenzie Eaglen with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said, ""That’s not a hard number and anybody would be crazy to suggest it is. It would have to be a very slow ramp-up and they would be hard-pressed to even achieve a 4 percent base budget by the end of the first term.’’

This suggests there is some flexibility on Romney’s part, although the candidate himself has not expressed that.

 What the Pentagon is asking for

In the debate, Romney said, ""Our Navy is smaller now than at any time since 1917. The Navy said they needed 313 ships to carry out their mission. We're now at under 285.""

In fact, the 313-ship plan reflects a 2005 strategic review. In April, the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, presented a new program that sets a goal of 300 ships. Mabus’s remarks came at a moment when Romney had been vocal in his opposition to the new approach.

""A lot of this criticism is based on either incomplete and/or inaccurate or outdated information, or a failure to see beyond the short term or a willingness to protect the status quo in spite of the changing world and in spite of overwhelming evidence to the contrary,"" he said.

The president’s budget calls for $487 billion in defense savings between now and 2021. His defense secretary, Leon Panetta, and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Martin Dempsey, have both spoken up for the plan, as have the heads of all five branches of the military.

""We are developing today the Joint Force the nation will need in 2020,"" Dempsey told the Senate budget committee. ""We will be a military that is able to do more than one thing at a time—to win any conflict, anywhere.""

Panetta acknowledged that the budget comes with risks but he said the department’s plan was based on looking first at the threats the nation might face.

""The department would need to make a strategic shift regardless of the nation's fiscal situation.,"" Panetta told the budget committee. ""We are at that point in history. That's the reality of the world we live in.""

Administration critics say the reality was just the reverse. A report from the conservative Heritage Foundation said, ""the administration set a goal of slashing the defense budget, and then crafted a strategy justifying such draconian cuts.""

The president is the commander-in-chief. Panetta works for Obama and the military answers to him. To the analysts at the Heritage Foundation, the chain of command says it all. But in the past, when military commanders have disagreed with presidents, they have found ways to get their complaints to the public.

This is not to say that all commanders are pleased with the trade-offs they face. But Nora Bensahel, deputy director of studies at the Center for New American Security, said she believes the president put a great deal of time into discussions with the military, and by and large, the commanders support the plan.

""It’s hard to see daylight between the military and the White House on this,"" Bensahel said.

Broadly speaking, it is always possible that the service chiefs would disagree over funding of individual programs but that is within the overall budget limits.

 Our ruling

The president said Romney planned to increase defense spending by $2 trillion and that was money the military hadn’t asked for.

Military leaders have testified in support of the president’s spending plan, and we found no evidence of disagreement behind the scenes.

"['Ohio', 'Education', 'Guns', 'Chris Redfern']","
Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern says Gov. John Kasich has power to force school board president to step aside
","
Re-posting an item from a friend on Facebook led to calls for the resignation of the president of the Ohio Board of Education, Debe Terhar.
Terhar, a Republican from Cincinnati, re-posted a photograph of Hitler with a caption reading: ""Never forget what this tyrant said: ‘To conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens.’ — Adolf Hitler.""

The Columbus Dispatch, reporting the story, said the item originated ""with the Facebook page of Uncle Sam’s Misguided Children, which features a variety of anti-Obama, pro-gun posts and pictures.""

After the story appeared, Terhar removed the material, and then closed her Facebook page. She issued a statement saying she was not comparing President Obama to Hitler, had not researched the posted material and had made no comment on it.

A little research might have saved a lot of trouble.

Our friends at the myth-busting site Snopes.com could not find any source documenting the purported Hitler quote. Neither could Salon.com, which pointed us to a 2004 paper by University of Chicago law professor Bernard Harcourt. He found the quote ""is probably a fraud and was likely never uttered."" (Harcourt further noted that the Weimar government immediately before Hitler’s had tougher gun laws than the Nazi regime.)

Terhar, who is married to Ohio Rep. Lou Terhar, said in a statement that she regretted ""the consequences of carelessly sharing"" the posted material and would be ""more selective in my use of social media in the future.""

Gov. John Kasich said he saw no need for further action.

""It was clearly a mistake, and she says it was a mistake,"" he told the Dispatch from the World Economic Forum in Switzerland. ""I’m glad that she’s come out and said she’s sorry about it, that it’s a mistake, and she’s not going to do it again.""

Ohio Democrats led calls for Terhar to resign. Ohio Democratic Party Chairman Chris Redfern went further in a statement.

""In absence of a full, formal apology from Terhar,"" Redfern said, ""Kasich has a duty to remove his hand-picked state school board president from office.""

A subsequent email from Redfern that solicited letters to Kasich and the school board demanding Terhar's resignation carried the subject line, ""Tell Kasich: Fire Terhar!""

PolitiFact Ohio wondered if Kasich had the power to do that. We called Redfern's office.

A party spokesman, Jerid Kurtz, told us that Redfern understands Kasich has no direct formal power to remove Terhar, but Kasich does have a bully pulpit as the state's most visible and arguably most powerful public figure. The governor should issue a statement of no confidence, rather than his initial ""no comment,"" and can pressure Terhar to resign as president, Kurtz said for Redfern.

Kurtz noted that Kasich showed power over the board two years ago by forcing out Superintendent Deborah Delisle, who resigned, citing pressure from the governor’s office.

The state superintendent serves at the discretion of the board. Delisle said in a letter to board members that Kasich’s administration had informed her that a majority of the board would replace her if she did not step down. The same day, Terhar was elected board president by fellow board members with Kasich’s support, reversing the outcome of a vote two months earlier.

Using that example, one would conclude that if Kasich wanted Terhar gone from the president’s chair, he has the influence to make it happen.

Removing her from the board altogether would be a different matter.

The board is made up of 19 members. Eleven are elected on a district basis, and eight are appointed by the governor.

Terhar, self-described as ""an early participant in the Tea Party,"" is an elected member from Cincinnati representing Hamilton and Warren counties. She started her four-year term on Jan. 1, 2011, was elected board president in March 2011 and re-elected unanimously by the board to the post last month.

Her seat on the board is not among the positions subject to removal at the pleasure of the governor under the Ohio Revised Code.

Under the code and the state constitution, in fact, Ohio lacks any provision for the recall of state officials.

So what's the verdict here?

Terhar posted a bogus quotation and false history. Whether there should be consequences is a matter of opinion that we can't rate. That includes calls for her resignation.

Redfern's statement that Kasich ""has a duty to remove"" her, however, means that Kasich has the power to do so.

The Democratic Party spokesman, explaining Redfern’s remarks, said the call for Terhar’s resignation or removal extended only to her position as school board president, not as a board member. That’s an important distinction.

He acknowledged that Kasich does not have statutory control over the Board of Education, but he accurately cited Kasich’s forcing out of a state school superintendent as a demonstration of the governor’s power over the board.

We rate Redfern’s statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/aug/17/chris-redfern/ohio-democratic-party-chairman-chris-redfern-says-/

Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel says U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown has sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries
","
Federal spending is a major issue in the U.S. Senate campaign of Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, the Republican trying to unseat incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown. Mandel says spending is wasteful and unsustainable, and he names Brown as a reason.
 Among several claims in Mandel's TV ad ""Change,"" which accuses Brown of trying to hide his record, is one that says ""Brown sent billions of our tax dollars to foreign countries.""

PolitiFact Ohio can't say if spending is wasteful, and we don't have a crystal ball to judge if it is sustainable. But we can assess if Brown is ""hiding"" (as the ad states) that he has sent billions of tax dollars overseas.

The ad's claim is spoken by an announcer and appears on screen next to a photo of Brown. In the background is a blended collage of the flags of Panama, China and South Korea.

The source cited in the ad for the claim is an article that appeared Sept. 9, 2010 in the Washington Times. The article said the Department of Energy had acknowledged that ""as much as 80 percent of some green (energy) programs, including $2.3 billion of manufacturing tax credits, went to foreign firms that employed workers primarily in countries including China, South Korea and Spain, rather than in the United States.""

The story also referred to a report by American University’s Investigative Reporting Workshop, in February 2010, that more than 79 percent of the first $2.1 billion in stimulus grants to wind energy companies went to foreign firms.

The report noted, however, that the grant money was distributed under a program administered by the Energy Department and Treasury, and not by Congress. In some instances, it said, the money went to the American subsidiaries of foreign companies.

The Washington Times story goes on to say that the Investigative Reporting Workshop report ""raised alarms in Congress. Leading Democrats insisted that the money be spent at home, but restrictions on the funds proved impossible without the specter of a trade war.""

Brown, who is not mentioned in the Washington Times article, was actually one of the senators who called for the Obama administration to suspend the program indefinitely ""until the law can be fixed so that funds only flow to projects that will create jobs in the United States.""

Co-sponsoring legislation to make that a requirement, Brown said, ""Taxpayers expect the government to use their dollars to support American jobs.""

PolitiFact Ohio looked at the wind project with the Chinese connection earlier this year and found it never got completed. Since companies could only collect money after completion and the program expired last year, it is safe to say that the amount that went to China was ""zero,"" Russ Choma, the reporter who performed the digging at the Investigative Reporting Workshop, told us.

Our friends at FactCheck.org, who also examined the Mandel ad's claim, found it to be ""highly misleading"" and not true.

Because the citation in the ad did not support the claim, we asked Mandel's campaign if it had additional sources.

""The charge in the ad is also supported by Sen. Brown's votes relative to foreign aid appropriations,"" spokesman Travis Considine said, citing a story from Politico as ""the most recent example of a vote held on the Appropriations Committee Sen. Brown sits on that approved $52.1 billion in foreign aid.""

He also provided a voting record to show that Brown ""has voted for at least $257.9 billion in foreign operations funding since he came to Washington in 1993."" The list included votes on omnibus appropriations bills, which cover many areas of spending and often enjoy wide bipartisan support.

The $52.1 billion figure in the Politico story refers to the State Department and foreign operations budget. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, that budget funds U.S. diplomatic and foreign aid activities, and ""has been the primary legislative vehicle through which Congress reviews the U.S. international affairs budget and influences executive branch foreign policy making in recent years.""

Included in the budget are the cost of building, staffing and protecting embassies and consular activities; funding for the war-related states of Iraq, Afghanistan and Pakistan, which were exceeded by Israel as the top U.S. foreign aid recipients; foreign economic and security assistance, and contributions to international organizations and missions and multilateral financial institutions.

""U.S. national security, trade promotion, and humanitarian interests are rationales for most international affairs activities,"" the Congressional Research Service said in its report on the budget.

The CRS also summed up debate about the budget: ""International affairs expenditures typically amount to about 1.5 percent of the total federal budget. While some foreign policy and defense experts view that share as a small price to pay for a robust foreign affairs budget that they believe is essential to meeting national security and foreign policy objectives, others see international affairs spending, particularly foreign aid, as an attractive target for significant spending cuts in order to reduce deficit spending.""

How much could spending practically be cut?

Sen. Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma, is a fiscal conservative who has been called ""the Senate's chief waste-watcher."" He released a $9 trillion deficit reduction plan last year that would trim ""wasteful, duplicative and low-priority spending"" from the Department of State and its foreign operations budget.

He estimated the 10-year savings at $192 billion, which still would leave a multi-billion dollar foreign operations budget annually.

As for the ad's flags of China, Panama and South Korea, we have previously found Brown to be one of the Senate's most ardent critics of U.S. foreign trade policies. He has voted against trade deals with China, Panama and South Korea -- and Colombia, Central America, Mexico and Canada.

Let's bring it home.

The ad claims Brown sent billions of dollars to foreign countries. The information that the ad uses to back up that claim, that Brown voted for the stimulus bill, has been proven false. Brown did not make decisions on how that money would be spent, and he was one of the senators who called for its suspension after the foreign grants were reported.

When confronted with those facts, the Mandel campaign offered as support for its claim that Brown votes for appropriations for U.S. foreign operations. That's the money for embassies, war-related spending to help establish new governments and the U.S. portions of international missions. That's a ridiculous stretch from what the ad implies, which is that Brown tried to hide that he irresponsibly sent billions or our tax dollars to foreign countries.

We have a rating for statements that are both false and ridiculous. It's Pants on Fire.

Rick Perry says Social Security is a Ponzi scheme
","
One of the most talked-about comments from the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s claim that Social Security is a ""Ponzi scheme."" At the Sept. 12, 2011, GOP debate in Tampa, Perry toned down his rhetoric somewhat -- but didn’t disown the phrase that caused such a stir. 
The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme became fodder for sparring between Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- the two candidates many observers consider the frontrunners for the nomination. 

Romney and his camp argued that the comparison of the retirement-security program for older Americans to an insidious financial fraud raised questions about Perry’s commitment to the program, which remains popular among Americans, and particularly older Americans who are statistically likelier to vote.

Here’s the original quote and context from the Sept. 7 debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif.:

""People who are on Social Security today, men and women who are receiving those benefits today, are individuals at my age that are in line pretty quick to get them, they don't need to worry about anything. But I think the Republican candidates are talking about ways to transition this program, and it is a monstrous lie. It is a Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 or 30 years old today, you're paying into a program that's going to be there. Anybody that's for the status quo with Social Security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids, and it's not right.""

Perry didn’t explicitly back away from the term, but he has sought to reframe the issue in a less polarizing fashion. In an op-ed in USA Today titled, ""Rick Perry: I am going to be honest with the American people,"" Perry didn’t mention the phrase ""Ponzi scheme,"" but he reiterated his concerns about Social Security’s financial outlook using less controversial language.

""Our elected leaders must have the strength to speak frankly about entitlement reform if we are to right our nation's financial course and get the USA working again,"" he said, adding, ""We must have the guts to talk about its financial condition if we are to fix Social Security and make it financially viable for generations to come.""

During the Sept. 12 CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa, moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Perry why he had changed his tone in the op-ed.

Perry maintained the cooler tone but didn’t back away from the terminology. ""Well, first off, the people who are on Social Security today need to understand something,"" he said. ""Slam-dunk guaranteed, that program is going to be there in place for those. Those individuals that are moving towards being on Social Security, that program's going to be there for them when they arrive there.

""But the idea that we have not had the courage to stand up and look Americans in the face, young mid-career professionals or kids that are my children's age and look them in the eye and said, listen, this is a broken system. It has been called a Ponzi scheme by many people long
before me. But no one's had the courage to stand up and say, here is how we're going to reform it.

""We're going to transform it for those in those mid-career ages, but we're going to fix it so that our young Americans that are going out into the workforce today will know without a doubt that there were some people who came along that didn't lie to them, that didn't try to go around the edges and told them the truth.""

As Perry noted, he was hardly the first person to compare Social Security to a Ponzi scheme; it has popped up frequently as an analogy among conservatives for many years. And in the wake of Perry’s comment, conservatives have gleefully dug up examples of liberals writing similar comparisons. A Sept. 12 article in the conservative National Review Online by Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, detailed Ponzi comparisons made by a half-dozen left-of-center columnists, including William Raspberry, Max Frankel and Michael Kinsley.

Still, Perry’s use of the comparison in the midst of a heated Republican primary campaign has attracted far more public and media attention than previous mentions -- and the fact many commentators have made this case doesn’t mean the comparison is justified. So we thought it would be worth recapping the evidence we’ve found for and against the idea that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.

*****

So what is a Ponzi scheme? PolitiFact Texas looked at this question when researching the issue for a fact-check of Perry’s Ponzi-related comments from November 2010, when he was touring to promote his book, Fed Up!: Our Fight to Save America from Washington.

According to an online post by the Social Security Administration, the term originates with Charles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions in 1920 by promising returns of up to 100 percent in 90 days on investments in foreign postal coupons. After first-round investors harvested those profits, others flocked to Ponzi, unaware his ""profits"" consisted of money paid in by other investors.

""The reason that this is a scheme and not an investment strategy is that the geometric progression it depends on is unsustainable,"" the government post says. ""You must continually get more and more new people into the system to pay off the promises to the earlier members.""

In contrast, the administration says, Social Security is more like a ""pay-as-you-go"" system transferring payroll tax payments by American workers to American retirees. Its web post closes: ""The first modern social insurance program began in Germany in 1889 and has been in continuous operation for more than 100 years. The American Social Security system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935. Charles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days.""

When PolitiFact Texas asked Perry for back-up on his Ponzi scheme description, his campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said that ""this year, Social Security is expected to pay out more in benefits than it collects in taxes. Americans today are being forced to pay for a program that they will no longer see any benefit from or return on their investment as it currently stands, similar to a Ponzi scheme.""

So how valid is the comparison?

Mitchell Zuckoff, a Boston University journalism professor who has written a book on Ponzi, noted three critical dissimilarities between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme, which by definition is both fraudulent and unsustainable.

""First, in the case of Social Security, no one is being misled,"" Zuckoff wrote in a January 2009 article in Fortune. ""...Social Security is exactly what it claims to be: A mandatory transfer payment system under which current workers are taxed on their incomes to pay benefits, with no promises of huge returns.""

Second, he wrote, ""A Ponzi scheme is unsustainable because the number of potential investors is eventually exhausted. That's when the last people to participate are out of luck; the music stops and there's nowhere to sit. It's true that Social Security faces a huge burden — and a significant, long-term financing problem — in light of retiring Baby Boomers. … But Social Security can be, and has been, tweaked and modified to reflect changes in the size of the taxpaying workforce and the number of beneficiaries. It would take great political will, but the government could change benefit formulas or take other steps, like increasing taxes, to keep the system from failing.""

Third, Zuckoff wrote, ""Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme... At the height of the Great Depression, our society (see ""Social"") resolved to create a safety net (see ""Security"") in the form of a social insurance policy that would pay modest benefits to retirees, the disabled and the survivors of deceased workers. By design, that means a certain amount of wealth transfer, with richer workers subsidizing poorer ones.That might rankle, but it's not fraud... None of this is to suggest that Social Security is a perfect system or that there aren't sizeable problems facing the incoming administration and Congress. But it's not a Ponzi scheme. And Ponzi himself, who died in a hospital charity ward with only enough money for his burial, would never have recognized it as his own.""

We agree with Zuckoff’s interpretation. We rated Perry's November 2010 comparison of Social Security and Ponzi schemes False, and we stand by that ruling. The comparison still deserves a rating of False.",/factchecks/2010/nov/14/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-social-security-ponzi-scheme/
"['Jobs', 'Virginia', 'Bob McDonnell']","
Bob McDonnell says Virginia has gained 60,000 jobs since he became governor
","
It’s all about jobs, Gov. Bob McDonnell says.

During an Election Day interview, MSNBC  host Joe Scarborough hailed McDonnell as the ""Elvis"" of the job creation message that moved voters this fall. ""You started this in 2009 before anyone got this,"" Scarborough told the governor, referring to McDonnell’s pledge to create jobs during his successful campaign last year.

McDonnell replied that since taking office in January, ""we’ve been able to create about 60,000 net new jobs"" in Virginia.

We had two questions about McDonnell’s statement: Is his number right; and how much credit does the governor deserve for any upswing in Virginia employment since he took office?

We first checked the claim of ""about 60,000 net new jobs."" Stacey Johnson, McDonnell’s press secretary, said the number came from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Our next call went to the office of Lt. Gov. Bill Bolling, who heads McDonnell’s jobs team. Randy Marcus, Bolling’s chief of staff, compiles the job-creation figures for the administration. Marcus said he takes the most current BLS monthly figure for non-farm jobs in Virginia. Then he subtracts the number of non-farm jobs in Virginia in February, McDonnell’s first full month in office. The remainder is what the administration considers to be Virginia’s net job gain under McDonnell. It includes full and part-time jobs in the public and private sectors.

We ran the computation, based on the latest BLS numbers that had been posted more than a week before McDonnell’s appearance on MSNBC. Here’s our result:

Virginia Workers, Sept. 2010        3,637,200
Virginia Workers, Feb. 2010         3,581,800
Net job gain under McDonnell            55,400

The governor’s claim of creating about 60,000 new jobs was a tad inflated, but certainly in the ballpark.

In July, McDonnell claimed 71,500 new Virginia jobs had been created since he took office. We checked those numbers and found them dead on. Much of the job loss since then was caused by the layoff of federal census workers and the slowing of construction.

McDonnell also said on MSNBC that only Texas has gained more jobs than Virginia since February. He’s right, according to BLS statistics. Texas has added 128,800 jobs since February.

Virginia has experienced a 1.55 percent increase in jobs since February. That ranks sixth. The District of Columbia leads everyone with 2.38 percent growth.

Now, let’s look at McDonnell’s statement ""we’ve"" created about 60,000 jobs. It suggests the new slots are the result of his administration’s actions.

""It’s not unique to the Governor, but it bothers me how all politicians take credit for creating jobs,"" said John Knapp, senior economist for the Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service at The University of Virginia. ""Barack Obama is not president of the economy and Bob McDonnell is not governor of the economy. Of course, what they do can have a marginal affect on things, but there are many other elements involved in creating jobs.""

Knapp added that state policies affect job creation development over the long run. ""But as year or two out, new state policies are not going to have a major impact on the economy.""

During recent decades, an array of prominent publications have consistently rated Virginia in the top handful of business-friendly states, noting the Commonwealth’s low tax rates,  and laws barring compulsory union membership.

Johnson said it is not McDonnell’s intention to claim credit for all new jobs under his watch. ""It’s a cumulative effort,"" she said. ""It’s the private sector that creates jobs; government can merely help set a conducive climate.""

Johnson said that when McDonnell said ""we’ve"" created about 60,000 net new jobs, ""he was referring to Virginia.""

It’s noteworthy that this February -- the month McDonnell uses as the starting benchmark for his administration’s job efforts -- Virginia’s unemployment rate was 7.2 percent, the highest in 28 years. The unemployment rate in September dipped to 6.8 percent, ranking Virginia as the eighth lowest state.

The national unemployment rate was 9.7 percent in February and 9.6 percent in September.

The vast majority of new Virginia jobs since February fell into one of three broad categories: leisure and hospitality; professional and business services; or trade, transportation and utilities.

McDonnell, a Republican, has been praised by legislators from both political parties for aggressively recruiting new businesses.  Over the first nine months of his administration -- starting in February, as the governor prefers -- the state has announced 186 business development deals promising 12,249 new jobs, according to statistics kept by the Virginia Economic Development Partnership.

In comparison, the state announced  213 development deals promising 11,656 new jobs during the final nine months of Gov. Tim Kaine’s term, ending in January.

It’s impossible to know how many how many of the jobs promised in state economic development announcements actually translate into employment gains recorded by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Many of the jobs are speculative and depend on construction and expansion of plants before people are hired.

So let’s review.

It’s clear the governor wants credit for the new jobs created in Virginia since February. But many factors beyond a governor’s purview influence employment figures and Virginia has benefited a strong business climate for decades. Some of the jobs filled since McDonnell took office were no doubt spawned by economic developments deals announced Kaine. It’s impossible to assign full credit to anyone.

Regardless of credit, have ""about 60,000 net new jobs"" been created in Virginia since February? It depends how you measure ""about."" The correct number at  the time was 55,400. The governor was a little bit off, but he wasn’t blowing smoke.

For that reason, we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2010/nov/12/bob-mcdonnell/bob-mcdonnell-says-virginia-has-gained-60000-jobs-/

"['Candidate Biography', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Abele']","
Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele says opponent Jeff Stone = Scott Walker
","
A doppelganger is a ghostly double of a living person. In German it means ""double walker.""

In the case of a new TV ad from Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele, it would be ""double Scott Walker.""

Naturally, state Rep. Jeff Stone -- Abele’s opponent in the April 5 election -- is the alleged double.

In a new TV ad with B-movie special effects, Abele presents Stone and the new Republican governor as scary, bleached-out phantoms in ideological lockstep on the ""unfair"" state budget repair law. Stone, the ad claims, will copy a Walker agenda that has ""mismanaged"" Milwaukee County government.

""I thought he was Scott Walker’s twin,"" a man identified as David Crowley of Milwaukee County says into the camera. Later, he adds: ""Jeff Stone is Scott Walker.""

Last fall in the governor’s race, we looked at the Republican primary ad Scott Walker used to equate opponent Mark Neumann with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We labeled Walker’s claim -- ""Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi,"" for shorthand -- and found it False.

Here, Abele’s ad essentially equates Stone with Walker.

So: Does Stone = Walker?

Of course, depending on where a voter sits, the degree of similarity could be considered a good thing or a bad thing.

But it’s worth evaluating, because both sides have made Stone’s ties to Walker a theme -- Stone ran as Walker’s logical successor for most of the race, and Abele is now pointing that out in a negative sense.

We asked the Abele campaign to back up the claim. They provided an analysis of voting records and pointed us to public statements and other evidence.

""They are overwhelmingly similar, and Jeff would represent a continuation of Scott Walker’s approach to governing,"" said Brandon Lorenz, Abele’s spokesman.

We’ll look at Walker and Stones’ statements about each other, as well as their voting histories, common causes, priorities, styles and backgrounds.

Walker and Stone have been linked closely because both are conservative Republicans from suburban Milwaukee communities who scored rare victories to succeed Democrats in office. They served in the Legislature together for about four years -- even carpooling together -- with Walker taking the higher profile.

Walker is seven years younger, at 43, but they got into elected politics within a year of each other. Stone started locally, as a Greenfield city alderman. Walker, from Wauwatosa, won a state Assembly seat.

Both considered the Milwaukee County exec’s job in 2002 after a pension scandal forced out F. Thomas Ament; only Walker jumped in. Stone helped Walker get elected. Now Stone wants to take over for Walker, and the governor says Stone -- whom he has endorsed and raised campaign money for -- would be a crucial local ally in reducing spending.

Stone and Walker’s statements:

Walker touted Stone in February 2010 as a worthy successor, saying he was ""interested in pursuing some of the same reforms and ideas"" that Walker has backed. That confirmed the impression at the Courthouse, dating back years, that Stone was the GOP’s candidate in waiting.

Stone has consistently praised Walker.

It should be noted though that from the start of his campaign he has said that his small-business experience would make him more focused on job creation than Walker, who Stone said was focused primarily on reforming county government after the pension scandal.

Are they close ideologically and by temperament?

Stone said in March 2011 that he and Walker share ""similar aspirations"" and ""a similarity in how we go about things. He urged a conservative audience: ""Vote for the person who’s going to move Milwaukee County forward along the lines of what Scott Walker has.""

Stone’s pre-primary campaign literature implored voters to back him to preserve gains being made during Walker’s tenure.

At times since Walker’s budget attracted massive protests in Madison this winter, Stone cautiously has tried to separate himself. He has said he will be less confrontational.

""I voted for the budget, but I'm not Scott Walker,"" said Stone. ""I'm Jeff Stone. I have a very different way of managing and doing business.""

Stone voted for Walker’s controversial budget-repair law, but later signaled he would not have tried to sharply curtail union bargaining rights if it had been up to him -- a position that earned him a Half Flip.

He voted for the business tax cuts Walker pushed in January’s special session.

Common Assembly voting history:

Stone and Walker overlapped in the Assembly from 1998 to 2002, when Walker was elected county executive. Stone has operated closer to power during his legislative career than did Walker (1993-2002). Stone served on the Legislature’s  budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. Walker made his mark mostly on law enforcement issues.

Research by Abele’s camp on more than 1,400 common votes shows Stone and Walker agreed 96 percent of the time. Stone doesn’t dispute that number.

There’s a limit, though, to how much insight comes from examining a mass of votes by two members of the same party, because most lawmakers vote the party line most of the time, and so many votes are minor.

So we looked at some ratings by a sampling of special interest groups on key legislation. The verdict: Stone and Walker have remarkably similar profiles, though not identical ones. 
Top priorities:

On the issues, Stone has adopted Walker’s signature anti-tax stance and similarly endorses smaller government. Stone and Walker jointly have proposed various tax cuts over the years. Like Walker, Stone has long been an active supporter of a photo ID requirement for voting.

The most notable difference: public transit.

Walker has been cool to expanding public transit for years, while Stone has made a regional transportation approach his signature issue.

""He’s been a great transit advocate for a decade,"" Kerry Thomas, interim executive director of Transit Now, a southeastern Wisconsin advocacy group, said of Stone.

There are limits to Stone’s support of new transportation options; he has spurned light rail, and he agreed with Walker’s stance against federal help for a high-speed train.

But Stone was a leading force behind creation of the Regional Transit Authority focused on commuter rail, and he has backed buses, and some -- but by no means all -- proposals for new funding options for public transit. Walker has taken a much tougher line against transit and new taxes or fees to pay for it. Stone is pledging an end to bus cuts seen under Walker and Ament.

Stone, like Walker, has backed freeway expansion.

Experience:

Stone emphatically says he is his own person and is going to ""do it my way.""

We asked him for examples of where he has broken with Walker -- and how his voting record compares.

He offered no criticism of Walker and pointed to no particular votes where they parted. But he notes correctly that he’s made a priority of regional transit, in contrast to Walker.

Their biggest difference, Stone said, is ""vastly different life experiences and what we’ve done in our career."" Stone has run a small printing company, while Walker worked briefly in the private sector before winning election.

He suggests that he will be more pragmatic and collegial than Walker.

""I have a very different way of managing and doing business that Scott Walker,"" he said at a candidate forum.

Stone has made a point of saying he will try to get along with the County Board and work with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Let’s review.

Abele’s strongest evidence comes from Stone himself, who has aligned himself closely with Walker’s agenda and politics. Their voting histories are very similar, and they win very similar ratings from interest groups.

They are not indistinguishable, though: The transit issue illustrates Stone’s willingness to step out from Republican orthodoxy and work behind the scenes in a bipartisan fashion -- neither of which are Walker trademarks. Stone’s business experience is a notable biographical difference.

In the end, Abele’s equation (Stone = Walker) scores out as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/13/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/
