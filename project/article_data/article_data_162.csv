Travis Forward PAC inaccurately says proposed county bonds won't tax older taxpayers
","Proponents of Travis County transportation and parks bond proposals on the November 2017 ballot made an enticing pitch to older homeowners in a mailer, telling them that their taxes are frozen and they won’t pay more if the bonds pass. Travis Forward, a pro-bonds PAC, said in an October 2017 mailer: ""The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen."" Readers asked us to check if the propositions won’t raise their taxes and also whether property taxes are frozen for homeowners 65 or older. We put the mailer’s claim to the Texas Truth-O-Meter. The ""freeze"" claim is inaccurate, Travis County officials quickly said to our inquiries, and it’s inaccurate to say the propositions won’t cost taxpayers anything extra. Travis County Judge Sarah Eckhardt, who voted with colleagues to place the two bond propositions on the ballot before helping to kick off the privately funded Travis Forward campaign, speculated that consultants behind the mailer assumed the county, like the Austin school district, provides tax freezes to homesteading homeowners 65 or older. ""No doubt, this is inaccurate,"" Eckhardt said by phone. ""To the extent I am responsible, I fall on my sword."" By phone to our inquiry, Marya Crigler, chief appraiser of the Travis Central Appraisal District, noted that by state law, every Texas school district must set a ceiling on how much homeowners 65 or older pay. Counties and other governmental jurisdictions have the local option of setting such ceilings, Crigler advised. See TCAD’s breakdown of exemptions and tax ceilings offered by Travis County jurisdictions here. Eckhardt helped us reach Mykle Tomlinson, Travis Forward’s campaign manager, who said by phone the errors occurred in mailers targeting older residents because consultants whom he did not identify misunderstood the difference between a homestead tax exemption and a tax freeze. After our inquiry, Tomlinson said the group would follow up by sending postcards within a day or so to the 12,295 households that received the mailer, which went out about the day the early-voting period began Oct. 23, 2017. At our request, Tomlinson emailed us a copy of the follow-up postcard which says on its front: ""We were wrong and we’re sorry!"" The back of the postcard is headlined: ""Setting the record straight."" Next comes text saying: ""The mailer we sent to your home last week wrongly claimed that, like school district taxes, senior homeowners’ county taxes are frozen under state law."" The back also says: ""State law does not require a county tax freeze for seniors. The mailer we sent to your home last week was inaccurate, and we’re sorry. Please help us set the record straight by sharing this with your friends and neighbors."" Bruce Elfant, Travis County’s tax assessor-collector, told us by phone that if the county propositions win approval, older homeowners will pay more in county taxes. According to the county, the owner of a home at the 2017 average taxable property value of $305,000 can expect to pay no more than $24 a year for 20 years should voters approve Proposition A, to spend $93.4 million on road, sidewalk, bike and other transportation-related projects, and Proposition B, devoting nearly $91.5 million to parks and land conservation projects. A county web page enables anyone to input any taxable property value--for homeowners, meaning the value, less exemptions including the county’s 20 percent homestead exemption--and see what the county estimates as the proposed bonds’ future annual costs to the property owner. Although the county has no tax freeze for older residents, it does give them an additional homestead exemption up to $80,000 on the assessed value of their home. That is, county taxes accrue on the property’s taxable assessed value above $80,000 for those 65 and older. Our ruling Travis Forward said in a mailer: ""The Travis County propositions will not raise your taxes! If you are 65 or older, your property taxes are frozen."" Neither claim holds up, we found, in that the propositions pose future tax costs for property owners with specific projected amounts driven by the assessed value of properties and the county doesn’t freeze taxes for homeowners 65 or older. Rather, such a resident qualifies to exempt $80,000 of the taxable assessed value of their home from county taxes. We rate this two-part to-be-retracted claim False.

Michael Moore flubs stats on people killed with guns during home invasions
","Documentary filmmaker Michael Moore’s response to the mass shooting in Las Vegas was to propose rewriting the Second Amendment, providing a laundry list of statistics to support his arguments for increased gun control. Moore suggested his ""proposed 28th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution"" in an Oct. 4, 2017, Facebook post, three days after a gunman killed 58 and wounded 489 in a massacre at a Las Vegas country music festival. His recommendations included limiting the number of bullets a firearm magazine may hold, banning all automatic and semi-automatic guns, and storing guns outside of the home. ""People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04 percent of all gun murders in the US. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them,"" Moore wrote. Polling shows that self-defense is the top reason most gun owners purchase their weapons, but we wondered whether Moore’s numbers were right. Do homicides during home invasions comprise 0.04 percent of all gun deaths in the United States? And are a third of those people killed with their own weapon? We attempted to contact Moore to learn what sources he used, but didn’t hear back. The figures we found in both cases are difficult to confirm, even for the experts. Problem No. 1: The term ""home invasion"" isn’t necessarily used in crime-tracking data. Broadly, the term usually describes a break-in at a residence while the people who live there are present, or more specifically, when someone breaks into a home to rob or hurt the residents. Some jurisdictions use it and some don’t, but there is no universal definition or dataset. What would be called a home invasion is often reclassified as the eventual crime committed by the suspect — a robbery, a physical attack or so forth. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s National Violent Death Reporting System tracks the location, weapon and crime being committed at the time of a violent death. But there’s no distinction about whether it was during a home invasion, or with the victim’s own firearm. The Federal Bureau of Investigation’s Uniform Crime Report and its Supplementary Homicide Report, which compile data voluntarily provided by local law enforcement agencies, track the number of homicides and whether another crime was being committed. Home invasion is not a specific category, however. Several experts on firearm statistics told us they hadn’t seen a recent study on either home invasions ending in homicide or who owned the weapon used, but Moore’s first point sounded somewhat reasonable. ""Every year, there are about 100 burglary homicides in the U.S. If half of these were gun homicides, he would be in the right ballpark,"" University of Chicago Crime Lab co-director Harold Pollack said. ""So the statistic isn’t wildly off base, but I haven’t seen a rigorous analysis. There’s no question that lethal home invasions are terrifying but rare events."" When we checked 2015 FBI figures, for example, there were 13,455 reported homicides, and 102 of those happened during burglaries. That’s 0.76 percent of all homicides — but there was no mention of the term home invasion, or the weapon used to commit the homicide. It turns out there is one study that did come close to defining things the way Moore did, but Moore overstated the reported figure. A 2010 report from the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics noted that ""between 2003 and 2007, approximately 2.1 million household burglaries were reported to the FBI each year on average. Household burglaries ending in homicide made up 0.004% of all burglaries during that period."" That’s about 86 people killed during a burglary annually, but the 0.004 percent is from all burglaries, not just ones classified as home invasions. Furthermore, the report’s 0.004 percent is 10 times less than the 0.04 percent figure Moore stated. The study also does not specify a gun was the murder weapon, but rather counts every homicide regardless of how it was committed. Shannan Catalano, a statistician at the Bureau of Justice Statistics, said the datapoint was actually only a side note in her larger report from 2010, but showed how few homicide-related burglaries there were overall. Moore appeared to take the figure from her study, she said, but for some reason got the percentage wrong. Catalano suggested it may have been a typographical error, but had no way of knowing Moore’s intent. Catalano’s broader study used data from her agency’s National Crime Victimization Survey, which uses statistical samples from a cross-section of addresses around the United States to estimate crimes. She said she will update the study in 2018, using the National Incident Based Reporting System. Like everyone else we contacted, Catalano also did not know of a statistic that supported Moore’s second assertion about a third of people being killed with their own gun during these attacks at home. Several studies show owning a firearm greatly increases the risk of unintentional gun-related deaths. Philip Cook, a public policy professor at Duke University, said if a statistic showing people killed by their own weapon in home burglaries exists, it’s not widely known. ""I’m quite sure that it’s not part of any of the standard databases,"" Cook said. ""So it must be a one-time study by someone, probably of limited scope."" Moore said, ""People who die from a home invasion make up a sad but minuscule .04 percent of all gun murders in the U.S. And over a third of them are killed by their own gun that the criminal has either stolen or wrestled from them."" While Moore has a point that guns are rarely used when someone breaks into a home, it is difficult to confirm. After interviewing several experts and agencies, we only found one study that came close to supporting Moore’s assertion about the number of home invasion deaths. Even then, the report’s author said Moore misstated the scope and specifics. Our sources conceded that the homicide rate during burglaries is a tiny fraction of overall gun deaths, committed during burglaries or otherwise. But none of them, including federal agencies that track crime, could independently verify Moore’s figures about the owner of the weapon used in those crimes the way he claimed. We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2017/oct/25/michael-moore/michael-moore-flubs-stats-people-killed-guns-durin/

Democrat running for mayor says southeast Raleigh gyms ""don't have air conditioning""
","Charles Francis says Raleigh isn’t spending its parks money fairly. Francis, a Democrat, is running for mayor of Raleigh against three-time incumbent Nancy McFarlane, who’s unaffiliated. They’re in a runoff after none of the three candidates – Francis, McFarlane and Republican Paul Fitts – secured the 50 percent of the vote required to win. (McFarlane got 48 percent, Francis got 36 percent and Fitts got 12 percent) In a debate Friday, Francis suggested the city shouldn’t focus all of its energy on Dix Park when more basic needs go unaddressed. Dix Park is a 308-acre property just south of downtown Raleigh that the city bought from the state in 2014 and plans to develop into a ""destination"" recreation spot. ""It’s not right that there are parks in Southeast Raleigh that still don’t have air conditioning in the gym,"" he said. ""We’ve got to have equity in the way we approach our parks."" Southeast Raleigh, the city’s lone predominantly black area, hasn’t enjoyed the same economic success as other areas of the city where businesses are opening and property values are rising. Francis grew up there and is campaigning on the idea that the city should be doing more for the area. A recent PolitiFact analysis of the Oct. 10 election showed Francis got his most fervent support in Southeast Raleigh. And he has previously talked about how those voters could swing the election. ""There are 80,000 black voters in Raleigh,"" Francis said at a forum in September. ""McFarlane normally wins with 25,000 to 30,000 votes. If only a quarter of African-American voters vote – and vote the right way – we’re going to win."" Given the city's budget is $919 million, PolitiFact wondered whether there are, indeed, gyms in Southeast Raleigh that don’t have air conditioning. What we found Turns out, the city controls 23 gyms at 19 venues. And yes, there are three gyms in southeast Raleigh that don’t have air-conditioning units, according to Raleigh’s parks, recreation and cultural resources department. Biltmore Hills Park, John Chavis Memorial Park and Tarboro Road Park are all located in southeast Raleigh and lack air conditioning units. But that’s not the whole story. There are six other Raleigh gyms that also lack air-conditioning. The gyms at Green Road Park, Lions Park in northeast Raleigh, Method Community Park in west Raleigh, Millbrook Exchange Park in north Raleigh and two gyms at Laurel Hills Park in northwest Raleigh also lack air conditioning. Most area gyms have AC There are also four gyms in the Southeast Raleigh area that do have air conditioning: Barwell Road Community Center, Halifax Community Center, Roberts Park Community Center and the Worthdale Community Center. The city says it didn’t begin putting air-conditioned gyms in park facilities until 2006. It costs about $300,000 to install units in older facilities. The city says its budget for capital projects will fund air-conditioning units in eight of the nine AC-less gyms by 2022. Method Park, the lone outlier, is being considered for AC funding as part of the 2023 budget, the city says. Our ruling Francis said gyms in Southeast Raleigh don't have air conditioning. There are four area gyms that have it and six gyms elsewhere in the city that don't have it. That context is important when debating city priorities and Francis didn't elaborate during the televised debate. But he's right: there are three gyms in Southeast Raleigh that don't have AC.

Scott Walker veers on NFL national anthem protests
","Responding to the controversy over NFL players kneeling or sitting during the national anthem, Green Bay Packers players issued a statement saying the ""NFL family is one of the most diverse communities in the world."" We found mixed evidence on that claim. The next day, on Sept. 27, 2017, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker was asked in Green Bay about the protests. He didn’t say what the protesting players should be doing. But less than a month later, the Republican governor, who is widely expected to run for a third term in 2018, was sending a different message. Which means it’s time to turn to our Flip-O-Meter, which assesses whether a politician has been consistent on an issue. Three Walker statements, and a mobilization effort, are key. They show the governor pivoting from a hands-off position to telling the NFL players exactly what they should do during the anthem. He also suggested the players instead take a stand against domestic violence, even though the protests have centered on racial inequality and police brutality. 1. ‘They should have to explain’ Walker was asked by a reporter in Green Bay on Sept. 27, 2017: ""You don’t find it disrespectful what’s happening, entering this political debate to sports? He said: ""Well, again, I’ll let others explain what they’re doing it and why they’re doing it. I just know in my household, my kids were always taught, as I was always taught, you stand and put your hand over your heart ….Now, part of those rights are the right to protest, so others can do that. But then they should have to explain why they’re doing that."" So, he made no direct statement to what players who had been protesting should do. 2. ‘Time for players in the NFL to stop their protests during the anthem’ In a letter Walker sent to the NFL and its players union, Oct. 16, 2017, Walker wrote: ""A lot has been made about National Football League players protesting by kneeling, remaining in the locker room, or other means during the national anthem. Speaking up for what you believe in is a profoundly American idea, but disrespecting our flag, and the men and women who have fought to protect and defend our country, is not American in the slightest. ""It is time for players in the NFL to stop their protests during the anthem and move on from what has become a divisive political sideshow …. ""My request is simple: Stand for the American flag and the national anthem out of respect for those who risk their lives for our freedoms, and then take a stand against domestic violence to keep American families safe."" Walker then repeated his call for the protests to end. 3. ‘It’s simple: Stand up’ In an interview on the ""Fox & Friends"" talk show on the Fox News Channel on Oct. 23, 2017, Walker said: ""For the NFL, it’s simple: Stand up, put your hand over your heart. Do what Americans are taught to do, like we were taught to do in my family and I passed on to my kids. When the national anthem is played, stand up and show respect for the men and women who are currently in harm’s way, as well as all those great veterans who fought for that flag. If you want to speak out on something else, do it at a different time in a different platform …."" 4. Mobilization Two days after the Fox interview, Walker’s campaign announced an online petition and digital ad campaign ""to build pressure on the NFL and its players to stop protesting the national anthem and flag."" So, Walker had gone from not directly addressing the players who were protesting to trying to mobilize Americans against them. Worth noting Walker has made it a point to underscore his new position. The anthem controversy had begun to die down when Walker took the step of sending his letter. And Walker’s campaign organization highlighted the governor’s statements about it on ""Fox & Friends,"" issuing a news release saying that he had ""urged"" players to stand, and starting the mobilization effort. There appears to be a wider political connection. The day after Walker released his letter, the Republican Governors Association, of which Walker is chairman, sent out a fundraising solicitation announcing ""I Stand"" bumper stickers were available in exchange for a campaign contribution to the association. The email says the stickers are available for a donation of $5 or more. The liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now pointed out the timing. Our rating Walker initially didn’t tell NFL players what they should do, but he did note the right to protest. Less than a month later, he said: ""It is time for players in the NFL to stop their protests during the anthem,"" and he asked the players to stand during the pre-game playing of the anthem. Then Walker went further, saying: ""For the NFL, it’s simple. Stand up, put your hand over your heart."" Finally, his campaign launched an online petition and digital ad campaign to pressure the players to stop their protests. On the Flip-O-Meter, our ratings are No Flip, Half Flip or Full Flop. For a partial change in position, we give Walker a Half Flip. Our rating Walker initially didn’t tell NFL players what they should do, but he did note the right to protest.

"['Abortion', 'Women', 'New York', 'Kevin Cahill']","
Is abortion at an all-time low in the United States?
","Assemblyman Kevin Cahill, D-Kingston, said abortions are less common now than ever before in the U.S. Cahill claimed the number of abortions has decreased to the lowest point in history four decades after the Supreme Court decision in Roe v. Wade. ""After the right was expanded, there was a rise in the number of abortions,"" Cahill said in a radio interview. ""But that number has subsided tremendously. It is at an all time legal low."" Most Democrats in the state legislature, Cahill included, support a bill that would guarantee access to abortion services in New York state if the Supreme Court overturns the landmark decision. Cahill believes having that access would keep the number of abortions low in New York state. But is he right that there are fewer abortions now than ever in the U.S.? Abortion was not universally legal in the U.S. until the Supreme Court decision in 1973. Earlier national data on legal abortions does not exist, and the number of illegal abortions performed before the decision is impossible to know. Cahill was talking about the number of abortions in the U.S. in his claim, according to his office. Two organizations have statistics on abortion that date back to 1973: The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and the Guttmacher Institute, a reproductive health policy and research organization. Data from the Guttmacher Institute is considered more comprehensive than CDC data. The CDC relies on numbers reported from states while the Guttmacher Institute does its own census of known abortion providers in every state. There were 744,610 abortions in the U.S. in 1973, according to the Guttmacher Institute. Cahill’s right that the number of legal abortions increased immediately after Roe v. Wade. The Guttmacher data shows the number peaked in 1988, when 1,590,750 abortions were recorded. That number has since decreased, aside from two small increases in 1996 and 2008. The Guttmacher data does not show each year’s count, instead tracking it every two to three years. The number of abortions decreased to 926,190 in 2014, the latest reporting period. That’s still higher than when the institute starting tracking the data in 1973. Measured another way -- abortions per capita -- the rate is at an all-time low. There were about 54 million more women living in the U.S. in 2014 than in 1973, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 1973, there were 16.3 abortions for every 1,000 women, and the 29.3 rate in 1980 remains an all-time high. There were 14.6 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2014, according to the Guttmacher Institute. In New York state, both the count and the rate fell to an all-time low in 2013 before increasing slightly in 2014. There were 119,940 abortions in New York state in 2014, compared with 212,700 in 1973. The rate has decreased from 54.5 abortions for every 1,000 women in 1973 to 29.6 in 2014. Cahill said abortion ""is at an all time legal low."" That's true if you consider the rate. The 14.6 abortions for every 1,000 women in 2014 is an all-time low. But his statement is false when counting the number. The number of abortions has gone down since its peak in 1988, but has not dropped below the 1973 count. The statement is partially accurate.

"['National', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Donald Trump']","
More to the story on poll Donald Trump tweeted about media trust
","From the earliest days on the campaign trail, President Donald Trump regularly touted polls that underscored his popularity with the public. Nine months into his term, the pattern continues. ""It is finally sinking through,"" Trump tweeted Oct. 22. ""46% of people believe major national news orgs fabricate stories about me. Fake news, even worse! Lost cred."" It is finally sinking through. 46% OF PEOPLE BELIEVE MAJOR NATIONAL NEWS ORGS FABRICATE STORIES ABOUT ME. FAKE NEWS, even worse! Lost cred. Trump was citing a Politico/Morning Consult poll. It asked, ""Do you believe the nation’s major news organizations fabricate news stories about President Trump and his administration, or not?"" Nearly half of the respondents, 46 percent, said yes, they do fabricate stories. Another 37 percent said no, and 17 percent said they didn’t know. So Trump accurately cited the poll results. The next question is, are the numbers credible? Several people who study polling told us that while they wouldn’t take the number to be precisely accurate, it’s fair to say that the results capture a widely held belief. The greatest uncertainty about the Morning Consult poll is that it was conducted online. The big issue there is that, unlike traditional polling, it doesn’t reach people randomly. Without getting too technical, picking people at random from a big list is the standard tool that allows pollsters to say that the people they reached are a good mirror of the public at large. With online polls, pollsters use information about the people who fill out the survey and massage their response statistically to mirror the public at large. That might sound fishy, and experts raise many legitimate concerns. But it doesn’t mean that the findings are automatically wrong. The ugly truth is that neither approach is fantastic. ""Pollsters employing both probability samples and non-probability samples are facing great challenges in measuring public opinion,"" said political scientist Adam Berinsky at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""While the Morning Consult poll is not a random sample poll, it is no better or worse than other online polls, and I don’t have any specific concerns about potential bias."" That said, Berinsky said he’s noticed that Morning Consult ""tends to lean a little pro-Trump relative to other polls."" That difference shows up on the presidential approval question. The Morning Consult survey reported that 44 percent of the people approved of the job Trump is doing. The average polling result today is 39.5 percent. Michael Traugott and Josh Pasek at the University of Michigan, who have written about polling together, also see a skew in the Morning Consult responses, but like Berinsky, they take the results as roughly accurate. ""Clearly some decent portion of the public does believe this,"" Pasek said. ""Is it 46 percent? I don’t know. But it is not as though you can disregard this out of hand."" The use of the word ""fabricate"" struck both researchers as odd. They wondered how people might interpret it. That’s one reason Traugott sees this response less as a measure of public mistrust in the media and more an expression of partisan preference. He noted that nearly three-quarters of Republicans in the poll said news organizations invent stories about Trump, while one-fifth of Democrats did. ""America is very polarized and this is consistent with that,"" Traugott said. Morning Consult cites its relative accuracy during the presidential election as proof that its results are reliable. Traugott and Pasek said that’s actually an easier challenge than gauging what the public thinks about the media. In fact, a couple of weeks before it partnered on this recent poll, Politico posted a story about the growing trust in news. It cited a Reuters/Ipsos poll that found 48 percent of people had a great deal or some confidence in the press, a rise of nearly 10 points from the time of the election. A Quinnipiac survey reported 54 percent of respondents said they trusted the media more than Trump to tell the truth about important issues. That doesn’t make the Morning Consult poll wrong. What it shows is that how you ask a question changes the answers people give. Trump said that 46 percent of people think news organizations fabricate stories about him. Trump accurately cited a recent poll result. The experts we reached said while the survey method is flawed, the problems aren’t big enough to invalidate its approximate findings. They cautioned against putting much weight on the exact number, which is generally in line with the country’s partisan divide. However, the survey tends to skew Republican and its results run counter to other recent polls showing that about half the public trusts the media to be fairly reliable, and as one poll found, more reliable than Trump. Given the softness of the number and that polls on related issues gave a different impression, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2017/oct/24/donald-trump/trump-says-46-people-think-media-make-news-about-h/
"['Crime', 'Missouri', 'Pete Hegseth']","
Pete Hegseth gives correct statistics on St. Louis crime
","The city of St. Louis made national headlines in September. After a judge acquitted former police officer Jason Stockley in the 2011 shooting of Anthony Lamar Smith, protests ensued. In a news segment on Sept. 17, 2017, Fox News contributor Pete Hegseth said, ""The city (St. Louis) is no stranger to violence. There were 5,762 violent crimes in 2015 alone, including 188 homicides. The highest rate per capita in the country, according to FBI crime statistics."" Did Hegseth get that right? We decided to find out. Fox News did not respond to requests for comment or evidence to back up Hegseth’s claim. Experts we talked to suggested St. Louis most likely has one of the highest crime rates per capita in the country, but they didn’t give us a definitive answer. ""I’m certain that St. Louis was near the top, but figuring out its exact rank requires arraying all cities of a certain size by their violent crime rate,"" said Richard Rosenfeld, a criminology professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis. The data Hegseth cited in his claim is readily available, so we did the math ourselves. The Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) collects and compares reported crime data by city, county, state and nation. A violent crime is defined as a murder, rape, robbery or aggravated assault. According to the 2015 Missouri crime statistics, there were 5,762 violent crimes and 188 murders in the city of St. Louis. We checked Hegseth’s claim by creating a new database using UCR’s data, which lists 2015 crime data for every state and city. Using cities with a population over 100,000, we calculated the rate per 100,000 people, for violent crime and homicide for each city. St. Louis had the highest violent crime rate and the highest homicide rate per 100,000 in the country in 2015, among cities with a population of 100,000 people or more. Though Hegseth referenced the 2015 data in his statement, the most recent UCR data available is from 2016. That year, St. Louis came in second for violent crimes per 100,000. Detroit ranked No. 1. We ran the same calculations on the most recent data, too. As for the homicide rate, St. Louis held its No. 1 spot in 2016. A USA Today article also breaks down the per capita statistics, citing 24/7 Wall Street. ""Adjusting for population, the city’s murder and violent crime rates, at 59 murders and 1,817 per 100,000 city residents, are each the highest in the country,"" the article states. In cities with a population of at least 100,000 people, St. Louis had both the highest violent crime rate per capita and murder rate per capita in the country in 2015. Detroit, Michigan is directly behind St. Louis with 1,759 violent crimes per capita and 43 murders per capita. Looking at the city of St. Louis, however, is particularly challenging, because it does not include the small suburbs near the downtown area. The city of St. Louis is independent from St. Louis County. For a previous fact-check, Sam Dotson, the ex-police chief of the St. Louis Metro Police Department, told us UCR statistics are ""absolutely not"" reflective of crime in the region. He said if you combined the county crime data with the city’s, St. Louis’ crime rate would drop drastically. Experts say Dotson has a point. James Alan Fox, a criminology professor at Northeastern University, told us previously that suburbs have a moderating effect on crime data, so crime rate can depend on whether and how many suburbs are included in the city’s jurisdiction. In this case, the city’s crime rate does not reflect any of the 90 municipalities or unincorporated parcels that make up St. Louis County. Fox News commentator Pete Hegseth said St. Louis had the highest crime rate and highest homicide rate per capita in the country in 2015, according to UCR data. Hegseth cites the data correctly. But experts caution against using crime data to compare cities. In St. Louis’ case, its high crime rate is at least partially explained because the St. Louis suburbs are not part of the city proper.

Trump says insurers made fortune off Obamacare. They didn't.
","As two dozen senators attempt to carve out a short-term compromise on the Affordable Care Act, President Donald Trump is sending mixed signals. At the heart of the deal are payments to insurance companies that sell certain policies on the Obamacare exchanges. In tweets and remarks, Trump both praised the compromise effort championed by Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., and flagged his displeasure. ""I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care,"" Trump tweeted Oct. 18. I am supportive of Lamar as a person & also of the process, but I can never support bailing out ins co's who have made a fortune w/ O'Care. The bailout, as Trump calls it, is no bailout; the money actually ends up with doctors, hospitals and other health care providers. But here we zero in on Trump’s statement that insurers ""have made a fortune with Obamacare."" There’s no question that the companies’ profits have been enormous. The question is, was Obamacare the cash cow? Based on the filings of the companies, and the analysis of people on Wall Street, at universities and a respected neutral health policy group, the answer is, no. The White House press office pointed to a news article that reported booming profits for the top five for-profit insurance companies, Aetna, Anthem, Cigna, Humana and UnitedHealth Group. Collectively, they had $4.5 billion in net earnings in the first three months of 2017. That cash was""the biggest first-quarter haul for the group since the Affordable Care Act exchanges went live in 2014,"" the article said. But the article doesn’t actually tie those profits to Obamacare. The fact is, Obamacare does not just include the exchanges where people buy private insurance. The exchanges themselves are a small slice of the overall insurance business. Despite the enormous attention paid to the exchanges, they make up less than 4 percent of the insurance market for people under 65. And contrary to Trump’s assertion, they have dragged profits down, not boosted them up, experts say. Returns from the exchanges have been so bad, three out of five of the companies listed in the article have fled. Aetna reported that it lost $650 million in 2016 and 2017 from the policies it sold in the individual market. For 2018, Aetna pulled out of every state exchange. UnitedHealth Group has also left the exchanges. It put its combined losses at over $1 billion in 2015 and 2016. Humana, which had sold in 11 states, got out too. Cigna trimmed its participation from seven states to six. Cigna CEO David Cordani told CNBC in August that the market is ""challenging,"" and that ""we are losing money, but we are losing a little less than we expected."" For 2018, Anthem also remains, but withdrew from Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin, and trimmed back the number of counties it serves in Kentucky, Georgia and California. It was going to leave Virginia completely, but then struck a deal with the state to sell in counties that would otherwise have no carrier. Moody’s Investor Service ranked it as a positive development for companies that exited the exchanges, saying it ""lowered exposure to this challenging business."" The overall individual market, which includes plans sold on and off the exchanges, brought an estimated $4.7 billion in underwriting losses in 2016, according to the consulting group Oliver Wyman. The news has not been all bad for the companies. Premium hikes in 2016 and 2017 began to balance things out. The Kaiser Family Foundation, a neutral source of health sector statistics, found that insurers who stayed in the exchanges had figured out how to come out ahead, but it took a couple of years for them to get there. So Trump missed the target completely when he linked the exchanges and the multi-billion dollar profits of five big insurance companies. But Obamacare is much more than the exchanges and parts of the program have both helped and hindered company profits. On the negative side of the ledger, the Affordable Care Act imposed limits on the spread between premiums collected and medical services paid out. For individual and small group plans, companies must spend at least 80 percent of premiums on providing care. For the large-group plans, the percent is 85 percent. ""This provision has likely had a modest downward effect on profits,"" said Larry Levitt with the Kaiser Family Foundation. In 2015, companies that fell below those minimums rebated about $400 million to customers, government numbers show. A tax on insurance companies helps finance Obamacare. Congress lifted it for 2017, but it is slated to return in 2018 with an estimated value of nearly $13 billion. Sheryl R. Skolnick, director of U.S. equity research at Mizuho Securities, tracks UnitedHealth Group specifically. ""That health insurance industry fee in 2018 is projected to cost the company $.75 a share on just about 1 billion shares,"" Skolnik said. On the positive side of the ledger, the one clear bright spot for insurers in Obamacare was the expansion of Medicaid. In the 32 states that extended the program to adults making as much as 138 percent of federal poverty, coverage is mainly handled through private insurers. ""Mostly as a result of expansion programs under the ACA, health plans and service providers experienced strong Medicaid growth over the early years of ACA,"" according to a report from Mark Farrah and Associates. Health care analysts at Milliman, an actuarial consulting firm, estimated that insurers had underwriting gains of $1.5 billion in 2016. That was a year when exchange losses topped $4 billion. A study in Michigan found that operating margins for the companies that managed Medicaid in that state improved four-fold between 2013 and 2015. How does this all add up for each of the five big insurance companies? Precision is difficult, but between the losses tied to the exchanges, regulations and taxes on one hand, and profits on Medicaid on the other, Skolnik said it’s a wash. ""I think it's fair to say that the health insurance industry has probably lost close to as much as they've gotten under the ACA,"" Skolnik said. Which raises the question, where did those hefty profits come from? The bulk of the business lies in employer-based coverage, which makes sense since that accounts for nearly 60 percent of the under-65 insurance market. Over the years, companies have benefited by shifting more of the costs onto customers through higher deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses. And mergers in the industry have also helped. ""Consolidation among insurers has led to higher margins,"" said economist Amanda Starc at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management. Medicare Advantage, a quasi-private version of traditional Medicare, has also been a key profit center for insurers. Under the program, the government contracts with insurance companies to deliver health care to seniors. The rising number of retirements among baby boomers has fueled that market. Enrollments are up, and the insurance companies have worked hard to keep their costs down. ""They are very aggressive there which gives them the clout to get better provider contracts,"" said J.B. Silvers, a professor of health finance at Case Western Reserve University. Trump said insurance companies have made a fortune with Obamacare. The White House cited the companies’ surging profits as proof. But just because insurers made billions since the time when the Affordable Care Act took effect, doesn’t mean that the ACA delivered those profits. Most of the companies had steep losses on the Obamacare exchanges and got out. Every report we saw and every expert we reached said insurers made their huge profits elsewhere, largely through their work in the large group or employer-based market or through the Medicare Advantage program. The expansion of Medicaid, another part of Obamacare also helped, but to a smaller degree. The fortune that Trump cited didn’t come from Obamacare.

No evidence to prove Medicaid expansion is fueling the opioid crisis
","As Florida’s lawmakers grapple with the opioid crisis, one U.S. representative says there’s a correlation between states that expanded Medicaid through Obamacare and states affected the worst by the epidemic. Republican U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz shared this factoid on Twitter on Oct. 17: ""Opioid crisis the worst in ObamaCare expansion states!"" Gaetz’s claim quoted a Tucker Carlson tweet that questioned if ""big pharma"" is responsible for Congress’ inaction toward the opioid crisis. Information supplied by Gaetz’s office rests on the notion that patients in states that expanded Medicaid through Obamacare have more access to legal prescriptions that fuel the opioid epidemic. Experts said the theory ignores critical facts and does not take into account the other factors that have led to an increase in opioid deaths. ""It is important to avoid confusing association with causation,"" said David A. Fiellin, a professor of medicine at Yale School of Medicine. ""Just because one event (Medicaid expansion) occurred during a period of increasing opioid deaths, many from illicit sources doesn't mean that it caused the increase in deaths."" Thirty-two states plus D.C. currently have adopted Medicaid benefits to all adults. The expansion for most states went into effect in January 2014. The timeframe matters because the most recent data is from 2015, meaning there’s not a lot of data to work with. In 2015, the five states with the highest rates of death due to drug overdose were West Virginia, New Hampshire, Kentucky, Ohio and Rhode Island, according to the Centers for Disease Control. All of those states expanded Medicaid. But there’s little evidence Medicaid expansion is the reason why. Many researchers, for instance, have noted that the overdose death rates were higher to begin with in those states. Richard Frank, a professor of Health Economics in the Department of Health Care Policy at Harvard Medical School sent PolitiFact Florida a research memo he co-wrote on the issue. Data he compiled from the CDC showed that the states that expanded Medicaid were experiencing higher levels of deaths due to opioids than non-expansion since 2010.  (Chart courtesy of Richard Frank) ""The opioid epidemic had already hit those states hardest before the ACA even passed and well before the expansions were implemented,"" the memo said. Vanderbilt University economist Andrew Goodman-Bacon and Harvard’s Emma Sandoe posit that other factors, including the opioid epidemic itself, led states to adopt the ACA Medicaid expansion in their look on the issue. ""A state with rapidly rising opioid deaths may have decided to expand Medicaid in order to provide drug treatment to more residents,"" the pair wrote. Frank and his colleague also found another problem with the Medicaid theory. The memo said since 2013, nearly all the increases in opioid overdoses in the United States is due to heroin and synthetic heroin substitutes.  In other words, it treats all drug overdoses the same. The data Gaetz cited from the CDC includes prescription and illicit drugs. Medicaid coverage does not provide access to illicit drugs. Data from the CDC shows that since about 2010 the number of deaths from commonly prescribed opiates has not fluctuated one way or another. In contrast, opioid deaths from heroin and other opioids, such as Fentanyl, have increased dramatically in that same time period.  ""A significant portion of the increase in deaths was due to deaths involving synthetic opioids other than methadone, which includes Fentanyl,"" the CDC says. Gaetz’s team also cited CDC Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report that said: ""opioid prescribing rates among Medicaid enrollees are at least twofold higher than rates for persons with private insurance."" But the data they cited was last updated in 2009, so Gaetz’s evidence was before the Affordable Care Act was even passed. This argument is common among individuals who believe Medicaid makes drug abuse worse, but it’s not accurate, according to the Goodman-Bacon and Sandone analysis. ""Medicaid patients, especially those who qualify through a disability and many who do not, are more likely to have chronic conditions and comorbidities that require pain relief,"" the duo wrote. Lastly, it’s worth noting that Medicaid expansion helps pay for opioid addiction treatment, said Brendan Saloner of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. Medicaid expansion covers costs treatments like detoxification, outpatient treatment, and treatment for masked health conditions. Gaetz said the ""opioid crisis (is) the worst in ObamaCare expansion states."" Gaetz is isolating on one year’s worth of data that, by itself, is flawed. The CDC data at the heart of this claim includes drug overdoses from illicit drugs that are not prescription opioids. And by ignoring a larger window, Gaetz misses the fact that the Medicaid expansion states he’s talking about had an opioid problem before the health care legislation took effect. Experts were universal in saying that the evidence that Medicaid expansion is somehow fueling the opioid crisis doesn’t exist. In some ways, it’s not much different than saying that the opioid crisis is worst in states in the eastern time zone. You wouldn’t blame a clock.

No, Sarah Huckabee Sanders did not dress up as a KKK member for Halloween
","A photo of a young girl dressed in Ku Klux Klan attire purported to be Sarah Huckabee Sanders is making the rounds on Facebook. Don’t believe it.

A sloppily photoshopped Chick-fil-A sign had then been layered over the picture.  That image accompanied a fake news story that purported Dan Cathy, the company’s president, had called for a racist controversy to stir up sales. The post followed news that counter-protests to Cathy’s opposition to gay marriage had caused a record spike in sales. ""Let’s milk this for all its worth,"" the fake news story credited Cathy as saying. ""Let’s wait until this gay thing dies down a little, then I will release another statement that says that we don’t like blacks either."" Cathy confirmed to Snopes the marketing ploy was fake.

Fake news: Tampa Bay Lightning fires black player for raising fist during anthem
","We can’t say exactly how many living, breathing people believed the article that the Tampa Bay Lightning fired hockey forward J.T. Brown, but whether it was humans or bots, they shared the story more than 20,000 times. That was enough to flag it on Facebook’s fake news list. A website called Conservative7.com ran a story with the headline, ""Black hockey player fired after raising fist during national anthem,"" on Oct. 10. It was a copy and paste job from a site called FreedomJunkshun.com, which first ran the story on Oct. 9. FreedomJunkshun.com is part of a group of sites run by liberal trolls who write absurd news stories in an attempt to fool conservatives.  The site runs the disclaimer that it ""uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth."" The warning goes on to say, ""All people, places, names and images should be considered fictitious or fictitious representations."" That nuance got lost in translation. According to the story, ""J.T. Brown of the Tampa Bay Lightning jumped on the ‘hate our troops’ bandwagon and made a ‘black power’ fist,"" as the national anthem played before a game. The result was swift, the article continued. The team owner, ""Burt Lancaster announced a few hours later that the team will be seeking a new forward to replace Brown."" What’s true here is that Brown did raise his fist before a Sept. 28 game against the Florida Panthers. Beyond that, the article is pure invention. Brown told the Tampa Bay Times that after a lot of discussion with friends in the military, teammates and coaches, he ""wanted to show my support for the root of the protest, talking about police brutality and inequality."" During the game, the Lightning released a statement, ""The Tampa Bay Lightning celebrate the moment before every game when we can unite as a community, paying homage to a flag that is representative of our nation and those who have sacrificed. At the same time, we respect our players and individual choices they may make on social and political issues."" In another bit of fantasy, the team owner is Jeff Vinik, not Burt Lancaster, a name more tied to Hollywood than hockey. Lastly, we checked the team roster . Brown is still on it. Brown was a healthy scratch for the Lightning’s last game, Saturday against Pittsburgh. Brown hasn't played since Oct. 7. But that likely has more to do with him being the 12th/13th forward on a team that has typically played just 11. Brown has said that he will not continue his protest, ""I am done raising my fist during the national anthem. I am now using this support, opportunity and platform to call out everyone who agreed or disagreed with me to help by sharing suggestions, continuing respectful conversations and looking for ways that they, too, can make a difference in the community."" A fake news site said the Tampa Bay Lightning fired Brown, an African-American player, after he raised his fist during the national anthem. Brown did raise his fist, but he wasn’t fired.

Debunking the claim that ""The KKK was founded as the military arm of the Democratic Party.""
","The Ku Klux Klan,  a white supremacy group, has been described by the Southern Poverty Law Center as the most infamous — and oldest — of American hate groups. The group’s heyday may be over, but controversy over Confederate monuments has brought the group back into the spotlight. The debate over Confederate symbols and monuments was reignited in June 2015, after Dylann Roof killed nine African-Americans in a Charleston, S.C., church in an attempt to ""start a race war."" There are numerous photos on the Internet showing Roof’s car with an ornamental Confederate license plate and Roof holding the Confederate flag. One month after the shooting, the Confederate flag was removed from the South Carolina Statehouse grounds and the issue receded.    It escalated again Aug. 12, 2017, when a group of about 50 Ku Klux Klan members and other white nationalists rallied to protest the planned removal of a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a public park in Charlottesville, Va. The white nationalists were met by a crowd of about 1,000 counter-protesters. After the rally dispersed, a car plowed into a group near the city’s downtown mall, killing a 32-year-old woman. Two weeks later, on Aug. 26, 2017, a Baltimore man identified as a Klan imperial wizard was arrested and charged with firing a gun during the rally. It was in this atmosphere that Madison Mayor Paul Soglin announced the removal of two Confederate memorials from the city’s Forest Hill Cemetery. A total of 140 Confederate soldiers -- prisoners of war who died at Camp Randall -- are buried in the cemetery. After the announcement, a ground-level ""Confederate Rest"" plaque installed in 1981 was removed. The fate of a larger, 4-foot tall monument installed in 1931 has been referred to the Common Council, while the debate over what to do with it continues. Soglin’s initial order prompted a news release from the Republican Party of Dane County, in which Chairman Scott Grabins scolded Soglin for an ""antiseptic wipe to the memory of American voters.""   The Aug. 25, 2017  release went on to cite various historical instances where Democrats opposed civil rights initiatives, ending the list with this assertion: ""The KKK was founded as the military arm of the Democratic Party."" When asked to back up the party’s claim, Grabins said the history of the Klan is well-known and cited the History.com website’s entry on the KKK. Let’s go to the history books. Klan history According to a History.com entry on the Klan: Founded in 1866, the Ku Klux Klan (KKK) extended into almost every southern state by 1870 and became a vehicle for white southern resistance to the Republican Party’s Reconstruction-era policies aimed at establishing political and economic equality for blacks. Its members waged an underground campaign of intimidation and violence directed at white and black Republican leaders. Though Congress passed legislation designed to curb Klan terrorism, the organization saw its primary goal – the reestablishment of white supremacy – fulfilled through Democratic victories in state legislatures across the South in the 1870s.  Historians weigh in James Marten, an author and chairman of the history department at Marquette University, disputed the Dane County GOP claim the Klan was ""founded"" as the military arm of the Democratic party. ""It was at its simplest a secret fraternal organization, but it very quickly became an organization dedicated to preserving white supremacy and intimidating African Americans,"" he said. ""They and other groups like them broke up schools, torched houses, and interfered with black social and church gatherings.   ""And, along with those other groups as well as individuals and gangs, committed thousands of acts of terror, violence, and murder throughout the South. However, the early Klan — the founding generation of the Klan — really only lasted into the 1870s before it was driven underground, and it was not an overtly political organization."" Eric Foner, a Columbia University history professor, noted the Klan was a ""military force."" ""In effect, the Klan was a military force serving the interests of the Democratic party, the planter class, and all those who desired restoration of white supremacy,"" he said. ""Its purposes were political, but political in the broadest sense, for it sought to affect power relations, both public and private, throughout Southern society."" But serving the interests of the party is not the same as being part of the party. Consider the political landscape today, where super PACs and other entities work outside the formal party structure. In a June 10, 2013, PolitiFact Virginia article, Carole Emberton, associate professor of history at the University at Buffalo, noted that the ""party lines of the 1860s/1870s are not the party lines of today."" ""Although the names stayed the same, the platforms of the two parties reversed each other in the mid-20th century, due in large part to white ‘Dixiecrats’ flight out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party after the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,"" she said. ""By then, the Democratic Party had become the party of ‘reform,’ supporting a variety of ‘liberal’ causes, including civil rights, women’s rights, etc. whereas this had been the banner of the Republican Party in the nineteenth century."" Our rating The Republican Party of Dane County claimed ""the KKK was founded as the military arm of the Democratic Party."" There is little doubt that the political interests of the Klan and the Democratic Party, at least in the early years, intersected. But there is no evidence that it was founded as part of the Democratic Party, or that the party ever even had an official ""military arm."" If a Democrat today claimed the KKK is the military arm of the Republican Party, we’d have a similar point of view.

Trump nominee, Nikki Haley, said countries are 'making money' off UN peacekeeping troops
","U.S. senators asked South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley about U.N. peacekeeping missions during her confirmation hearing to be America’s ambassador to the United Nations. They were especially concerned about the war-torn nation of South Sudan, but Haley tackled peacekeeping more broadly. Haley said there were red flags. ""It's been devastating to see the exploitation, the fraud, abuse that's happening,"" Haley said Jan. 18. ""We have to acknowledge that some countries are contributing troops because they're making money off of them. So if they are not willing to make sure that they are punishing the violators, then we actually need to pull that country's troops out, because they're harming the peace process."" Haley was referring to cases where peacekeeping troops sexually abused the very people they were sent to protect. The most recent case involved soldiers from France, Chad and Equatorial Guinea. But it was her assertion about countries making money off of peacekeeping that caught our eye. We took a closer look. The experts we reached agreed that yes, there is a financial incentive for certain nations. On the other hand, there was equally broad agreement that money isn’t the only factor. A little background on peacekeeping Under the banner of the United Nations, countries provide troops and equipment to troubled corners of the world to help them bridge the gap between conflict and stability. Right now, the U.N. has 16 operations, and nine of them are in Africa. Between troops, police and military observers, about 100,000 personnel make up the global peacekeeping force at a cost of about $1.9 billion for the year. Who sends the most troops? Ethiopia (8,165), Pakistan (6,774), India (6,752), Bangladesh (5,635) and Rwanda (5,125). Those five countries provide nearly a third of all peacekeepers. Why they send troops Money is a factor. Brett Schaefer, a Heritage Foundation analyst, told us the countries with the largest participation tend to be middle- or lower-income nations. ""Their payments to troops are low, and the amount they get from the U.N. is generally above that,"" Schaefer said. But he noted that gaining field experience, training and international prestige are powerful drivers too. Paul Williams at George Washington University also said the money should be put into perspective: ""It is very rarely, if ever the case, that this is the sole factor behind a state's decision to contribute troops."" For Bruce Jones at the Brookings Institution, a Washington-based academic center, India proves that point. ""It’s one of the most important contributors to U.N. peacekeeping,"" Jones said. ""But it no longer makes money from peacekeeping. It now loses money, but it's still doing it.  So that should tell us something."" If there’s a red flag to be waved with the U.N.’s African peacekeeping missions, it might have more to do with complex regional politics. Dyan Mazurana, a professor of international affairs at Tufts University, said some countries sending troops have a clear self-interest in the fate of their neighboring states. ""They are often playing a blurry role of peacekeepers, peace enforcement and being parties to the conflict, such as supporting various armed parties, selling weapons or extracting and profiting from natural resources,"" Mazurana said. None of the experts we reached found any connection between sexual assault and the payments to countries for the troops they send. They gave the U.N. credit for acting more swiftly to crack down on abuse, but they also said continued pressure is needed to ensure that the perpetrators actually face punishment. We reached Haley’s office but never received any comment on her statement. Our ruling Haley said that ""some countries"" contribute peacekeeping troops because they make money off the U.N. payments. Every expert we reached agreed that for some nations, the financial payoff is a factor. However, they all said that money was not the sole driver, and that countries gained military training and experience from the role they played.

Is Miami-Dade the No. 1 leader in breaking local Zika transmission?
","Miami-Dade Mayor Carlos Gimenez said that in 2016 the county became a global leader in fighting the mosquito-borne Zika virus. ""We were the first community in the world -- let me repeat that -- the first community and I believe the only community in the world to break the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus,"" Gimenez said during his State of the County speech Jan. 18. However, Gimenez didn’t declare Zika dead forever -- he warned that the county must remain vigilant: ""We may be in the off season, but that does not mean that our work is over."" Gimenez, a Republican re-elected to his last term in November, has a point about local transmission. The last of the four local transmission zones were cleared in Miami-Dade by mid December 2016. However, he omitted some caveats about Zika transmission and Miami-Dade’s special circumstances compared with the rest of the world. Zika in Miami-Dade Zika has been around for decades. But the current outbreak started in 2015, when Brazil reported cases of more babies being born with abnormally small heads, a condition called microcephaly. That condition was connected to mothers infected with Zika. The Centers for Disease Control defines areas of active Zika virus transmission as having two or more locally acquired cases of Zika virus infection, within two weeks, within 1 square mile. Those cases must be in separate households, with travel and sex ruled out as potential causes. Using those guidelines, the Florida Department of Health declared active Zika transmission zones and then lifted them when 45 days passed without any new local cases in those zones.  In July, the first local Zika cases were reported in Miami-Dade County. Over the next few months, the state declared four local Zika transmission zones. The state lifted the first zone, in Wynwood -- a trendy area near downtown Miami -- Sept. 19. That was the first community in the world to break local transmission, CDC spokesman Benjamin Haynes said. The state lifted the last of the four zones, in part of South Beach, on Dec. 9. But officials didn’t declare Zika entirely kicked to the curb forever; Miami-Dade remained a ""cautionary area"" according to the CDC. Officials warned that isolated cases could continue to appear --  the most recent one was Dec. 15. Let’s look at how Miami-Dade compared with some other areas in curbing Zika. In addition to Miami-Dade, only one other area in the United States had local Zika cases: Brownsville, Texas. Miami-Dade reported 257 cases of local transmission, while Brownsville reported six. The Texas Department of Health never declared a local transmission zone in Brownsville, but the CDC called it a ""cautionary area."" It’s difficult to compare Miami-Dade to other places where the Zika virus has been far more widespread. Brazil has had more than 128,000 cases and continues to battle Zika. Local transmission continues in Puerto Rico, which had more than 100 new cases this month and more than 37,000 since 2015. In Singapore, the government designated ""Zika clusters"" and announced that it had no more Dec. 15 after its last new case was reported Dec. 10. However, the ""only place it really stopped is in Florida,"" said Daniel Epstein, a spokesman for the Pan American Health Organization. There were other areas in the world where Zika dropped off before it hit Miami-Dade. For example, the outbreak in French Polynesia affected an estimated 28,000 people and lasted until 2014, said Monika Gehner, a WHO spokeswoman. Some caveats While Miami-Dade got kudos from the CDC for efforts to curb Zika, experts caution that it can return, particularly when the temperature rises. It’s too early to claim elimination, said Duane J. Gubler, an emerging infectious disease expert at Duke-NUS Medical School in Singapore. ""The absence of reported cases for a few months does not confirm the transmission cycle is broken,"" she said. ""After a year with active surveillance, I would probably accept it."" Florida also has certain advantages compared with other places of the world that have been struck by Zika, including better access to testing patients to verify that the virus is actually Zika. Also, in South Florida, with air conditioning and screens and modest mosquito density levels, transmission is less likely than countries that have less of that protection, University of Florida biostatistics professor Ira Longini said. ""There is no cycle to break,"" he said. ""Sustained transmission is impossible, but you do get small outbreaks when introductions occur."" Our ruling Gimenez said Miami-Dade is ""the first community in the world to break the cycle of local transmission of the Zika virus."" The CDC says that Wynwood, an area in Miami, was the first to break local transmission in September. The last of four local transmission zones was lifted Dec. 9. There are some caveats about Gimenez’s claim, including that only one other county in the United States had local cases, and a far smaller number. Some other places took a far greater hit from Zika than Florida did. Experts caution that Zika cases could return to South Florida, a point Gimenez also acknowledged in his speech.

White House website says D.C. homicides climbed 50 percent, but more recent data shows they fell
","When Donald Trump was inaugurated as the nation’s 45th president, the incoming administration quickly put its mark on the White House website. In the section titled, ""Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community,"" it says in part, ""The Trump Administration is committed to reducing violent crime. In 2015, homicides increased by 17 percent in America’s 50 largest cities. That’s the largest increase in 25 years. In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent. There were thousands of shootings in Chicago last year alone."" In this article, we’ll fact-check this portion of that statement: ""In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent."" The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article. We turned to data from the Metropolitan Police Department, the Washington, D.C., police force. In 2014, there were 105 homicides in D.C. The following year -- 2015 -- there were 162. That’s an increase of 54 percent -- and that’s in line with what the White House website said. But the story doesn’t end there. There is already city-level data for homicides in 2016, and the release of that data painted a different picture. The figure for 2016 was 135 homicides. That’s down 17 percent from the previous year -- not up roughly 50 percent. ""In 2015, Washington, D.C., as well as many other large cities, saw a significant increase in homicides,"" said Metropolitan Police Department spokeswoman Margarita A. Mikhaylova. But Washington, D.C., ""has been able to notably reduce the homicide rate in 2016."" She cited ""a concerted focus on removing illegal firearms from the streets, preventing robberies, and especially, continuing to build trust with the communities we serve."" Mikhaylova added that violent crime overall -- which includes homicides, sex crimes, assaults with a dangerous weapon, and robbery -- fell by 10 percent in Washington, D.C., between 2015 and 2016. Let’s look at the trend a little further back. So, over the previous two decades, the number of homicides in Washington, D.C., has tumbled -- it’s 55 percent lower than 20 years earlier. That said, the number of homicides has risen by 53 percent since it hit its lowest level in 2012. In theory, that statistic can be used to bolster Trump’s claim. However, using the low year of 2012 as the baseline amounts to cherry picking. Both the longer-term trend (20 years) and the most recent year-over-year figure are down, rather than up. Our ruling The Trump White House website said, ""In our nation’s capital, killings have risen by 50 percent."" That statistic would have been correct prior to the release of the most recent annual statistics by the Metropolitan Police Department. However, the most recent figures, from 2016, show a 17 percent decline in homicides from 2015. In addition, the long-term trend shows significantly lower numbers for homicides in Washington, D.C., than was the rule for the 1990s -- even if you compare the spike of 2015.

George Takei says White House removed pages about climate change, civil rights from website
","Barack Obama was the first president to have a robust digital strategy. His team was active on social media, and they constantly uploaded new content and tools to the White House website. But after President Donald Trump was sworn in on Jan. 20, 2017, some critics of the new administration noticed that pages about issues of importance to Obama are no longer accessible on whitehouse.gov. ""The White House removed its climate change web page. And the health care, civil rights and LGBT sections,"" tweeted George Takei, the former Star Trek actor who now has a large online fanbase. Takei is correct that as of Jan. 23, whitehouse.gov doesn’t have any specific information about climate change, health care, civil rights or LGBT issues. But these changes are routine and reflect the differences between Obama’s and Trump’s priorities. Back in October, the Obama administration laid out how it would manage the digital transition. The National Archives and Records Administration would preserve every piece of content the Obama administration published online — everything from blog posts and Tweets to transcripts and Snapchat stories. The National Archives would also freeze and archive any content posted to whitehouse.gov, then the Obama administration would hand over the domain to the Trump administration. The archived content is now accessible at ObamaWhiteHouse.archives.gov, including pages about climate change, health care, civil rights and LGBT issues.    So if we’re going to be nit-picky, it was the Obama administration that removed whitehouse.gov’s pages about these issues, along with every other piece of content their team ever published. The Trump administration started off with a blank slate. When populating the website with their own content, they did not create pages about the four issues Takei mentioned. They did, however, create six pages about issues that defined the Trump campaign: energy, foreign policy, jobs and economic growth, military, law enforcement, and trade. The Obama team handled the whitehouse.gov transition in the same manner as the George W. Bush and Bill Clinton administrations. (Their websites are archived at georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov and clinton4.nara.gov, respectively.) The National Archives treats whitehouse.gov as a presidential record and follows the relevant regulations to preserve the content for posterity, while ""the new administration is free to shape a ‘new’ White House website going forward,"" said Douglas Cox, a law professor and expert in information policy at the City University of New York. Cox added as an aside that while whitehouse.gov is well-preserved from administration to administration, the websites for federal agencies may not be. So there is a bigger concern that federal records produced by the agencies in prior administrations may get lost. When the Obama team took over whitehouse.gov, they completely replaced all of Bush’s policy pages with 24 of their own, reflecting the new administration’s agenda, said Macon Phillips, who oversaw the website changes as Obama’s director of new media during the 2008 transition. The change from Bush’s version of whitehouse.gov to Obama’s was dramatic in its own way. While Trump kept the same digital platform the Obama team used, Obama’s transition team was working with a brand new one. Here’s a screenshot of whitehouse.gov on the morning of Jan. 20, 2009, the day of Obama’s inauguration, next to a screenshot from that same evening (found using the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine):  Phillips said the fact that the Trump website doesn’t have pages about things like LGBT issues and climate change isn’t really about the new administration removing pages — it’s more that his team just hasn’t made those issues a priority. ""Whitehouse.gov should reflect the priorities and point of view of the president. It’s a tool of that office,"" said Phillips, who just ended three years as coordinator of the State Department’s International Information Programs Bureau. The Trump administration did keep one notable page from the Obama administration’s whitehouse.gov: the We the People page, where the public can sign electronic petitions. Under the Obama administration, any petition to garner 100,000 signatures in under 30 days would receive a response from the White House. A petition for Trump to release his tax returns got more than 271,000 signatures in four days. It’s unclear if the new administration will officially respond to the petition. Our ruling Takei said, ""The White House removed its climate change web page. And the healthcare, civil rights and LGBT sections."" It is literally accurate that since Trump became president, whitehouse.gov no longer has specific issue pages about health care, civil rights, LGBT issues or climate change. This reflects a difference in priorities between the Obama and Trump administrations. But it’s important to keep in mind that when the Obama administration handed the whitehouse.gov domain to Trump’s team, it was a blank slate. All of the online content published during Obama’s term was purged and archived. They’re now available on a website set up by the National Archives, as was done at the end of the Clinton and Bush administrations. While Takei’s claim has truth to it, this additional context is important, so we rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2017/jan/23/george-takei/george-takei-says-white-house-removed-pages-about-/

Trump wrongly blames press for feud with intel community
","The first agency Donald Trump visited as president was the Central Intelligence Agency, and he had nothing but praise for the people who work there. ""Very, very few people could do the job you people do,"" Trump said. He vowed to give the CIA all the support they might ever need and dismissed any talk that they didn’t enjoy his respect. ""I have a running war with the media,"" he said. ""They are among the most dishonest human beings on Earth. And they sort of made it sound like I had a feud with the intelligence community. And I just want to let you know, the reason you're the No. 1 stop is exactly the opposite."" In this fact-check, we examine whether the press created the storyline that there was friction between Trump and the intelligence community. A look at Trump’s own words reveal his readiness to deploy some harsh language. We count several specific instances when he publicly disparaged the intelligence community. On Dec. 9, 2016, the Washington Post reported that intelligence officials had concluded that Russia had interfered with the presidential election to undermine Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Citing an unnamed official, the article said, ""It is the assessment of the intelligence community that Russia’s goal here was to favor one candidate over the other, to help Trump get elected."" The Trump transition team responded with a statement that discredited the intelligence agencies. ""These are the same people that said Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction,"" the statement said. On Jan. 5, 2017, Trump had kinder words. ""The media lies to make it look like I am against ‘Intelligence’ when in fact I am a big fan!,"" he tweeted. Trump’s counselor, Kellyanne Conway, emphasized that point in a Jan. 22, 2017 interview on NBC’s Meet the Press. She noted a Jan. 6 statement from Trump in which he said, ""I respect the service of our great men and women in the intelligence community."" But Trump’s language took a sharper tone when CNN reported on Jan. 10, 2017, about a file claiming that the Russians had embarrassing personal and financial information on Trump. According to reports, the file had actually been compiled by people working for Trump’s American political opponents and leaked to the press. CNN reported that intelligence officials also received the file and had briefed both Trump and President Barack Obama about its existence. On Jan. 11, Trump tweeted ""Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ‘leak’ into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?"" Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to ""leak"" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? Trump didn’t back down when he was asked about the Nazi comparison at a press conference later that day. ""I think it was disgraceful — disgraceful that the intelligence agencies allowed any information that turned out to be so false and fake out,"" he said. ""I think it’s a disgrace, and I say that — and I say that, and that’s something that Nazi Germany would have done and did do."" Trump also tweeted his suspicions that intelligence officials were behind the leaked file. ""Totally made up facts by sleazebag political operatives, both Democrats and Republicans - FAKE NEWS! Russia says nothing exists. Probably released by ‘Intelligence’ even knowing there is no proof, and never will be."" Throughout the campaign, Trump consistently expressed doubt that Russia had meddled in the election at all. Allegations that Russia had stolen emails off the Democratic National Committee server were circulating by September. When the issue came up in the first presidential debate, Trump said ""I don't think anybody knows it was Russia that broke into the DNC. I mean, it could be Russia, but it could also be China. It could also be lots of other people. It also could be somebody sitting on their bed that weighs 400 pounds, okay?"" Trump stuck to that line even after the heads of Homeland Security and the National Intelligence office said in early October that they believed Russia was behind the DNC hacking. By that point, intelligence officials had briefed Trump with the details behind their conclusions. His steadfast skepticism prompted retired Gen. Michael Hayden, former director of the CIA and the National Security Agency, to tell the Washington Post, ""it defies logic."" National security historian Stephen Walt at Harvard University’s Kennedy School told us no other modern president has attacked the intelligence community in the way Trump has. ""Trump went well beyond the norm in this charge and now pretends he didn’t pick a fight with them, even though his remarks are a matter of public record,"" Walt said. Walt dismissed the idea that the press invented the friction between Trump and the intelligence community. Our ruling Trump said the media created the appearance that he had a feud with the intelligence community. Trump’s own words undercut that assertion. While he did call himself a ""big fan"" and respected the service of the members of the intelligence community, he also lashed out on several occasions. He said that intelligence officials had used Nazi-like tactics against him and belittled the agencies as a whole for their incorrect belief that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction. Trump also openly doubted their conclusions during the campaign that Russia was trying to interfere with the presidential election. The press did not invent Trump’s harsh words and dismissive tone.

Are pads and tampons taxed but Viagra and Rogaine not?
","Actress Ashley Judd declared herself a nasty woman at the Women’s March in Washington D.C., referring to President Donald Trump’s comment about Hillary Clinton during the general election campaign. Reciting a poem from 19-year-old Nina Donovan of Tennessee, Judd said she is nasty as in ""loud, vulgar and proud"" but not as nasty as ""racism, fraud, conflict of interest, homophobia, sexual assault, transphobia, white supremacy, misogyny, ignorance, white privilege."" ""I am not nasty like the combo of Trump and Pence being served up to me in my voting booths. I'm nasty like the battles my grandmothers fought to get me into that voting booth,"" Judd said. ""Tell me, why are pads and tampons still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not?"" We’re happy to oblige, because Judd’s claim isn’t fully accurate. (We tried to reach Judd the day after the march but didn't hear back; we'll update this item if we do.) When it comes to sales taxes on purchases, states typically set the rules. Seven states currently exempt tampons, menstrual cups and pads from taxation, the latest of which came into effect Jan. 1, 2017 (Illinois), said sales tax consultant Diane Yetter. Washington D.C.’s exemption, passed in December 2016, is pending congressional approval, and Connecticut's will kick in July 1, 2018. Five states (Alaska, Delaware, Montana, New Hampshire and Oregon) have no sales tax at all. So, as of Jan. 22, 2017, 38 states and D.C. tax feminine hygiene products. Because it is a prescription drug, Viagra, an erectile dysfunction medicine, isn’t taxed in any state except Illinois.   Rogaine, a product for hair loss, is exempt from taxes in eight states because it is an over-the-counter treatment and doesn’t require a prescription. (Four states have qualified exemptions for nonprescription that Rogaine does not appear to qualify for.) We won’t weigh in on whether the disparity between taxation of feminine hygiene and erectile dysfunction drugs is ethical or sexist. But there is context for how that disparity came to exist.   Nicole Kaeding, a state tax policy analyst at the free-market oriented Tax Foundation, stressed that the term ""tampon tax"" is a misnomer because feminine hygiene products are not subject to a specific tax in any state. ""There is no more a tampon tax than there is a soap tax, shampoo tax, or toilet paper tax,"" Kaeding said. As we mentioned, many states do provide exemptions for necessities like food and medicine. (Kaeding and the Tax Analysts’ David Brunori believe these items should be taxed as well.) But ""menstruation isn’t considered a disease or illness,"" said Yetter. ""Tampons and pads are often included in the category of grooming and hygiene products."" It’s also important to note that tax exemptions apply to broad categories and not any male product explicitly.   ""You could easily pick a drug that only applies to females, say birth control pills, and those would fall under the same sales tax exemptions as Viagra or Rogaine,"" said Kaeding. Our ruling Judd said, ""Pads and tampons (are) still taxed when Viagra and Rogaine are not."" Most states do tax tampons and pads, but not Viagra. Judd is off the mark for Rogaine, which is taxed in most states.   But it’s important to note that these taxes apply to broad categories and are not specific to tampons or Viagra. Birth control, for example, would also be exempt from taxation in most states because it, like Viagra, is a prescription drug.

Donald Trump had biggest inaugural crowd ever? Metrics don't show it
","At the first press briefing of the new administration, White House press secretary Sean Spicer blasted the media, saying they deliberately misled the public about the size of President Donald Trump’s inauguration crowd. ""Photographs of the inaugural proceedings were intentionally framed in a way, in one particular Tweet, to minimize the enormous support that had gathered on the National Mall,"" Spicer said on Jan. 21. ""That was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period. Both in person and around the globe."" Spicer offered a few ""facts"" to disprove media reports of low turnout, but many of them are misleading or inaccurate. His overall assertion that Trump’s inaugural drew the ""largest audience"" ever is flat-out wrong. Infrastructure issues Spicer pointed to changes in infrastructure that gave the illusion of low turnout. It was the ""first time"" that floor coverings were used to protect the grass on the National Mall, which had highlighted empty spots in the inaugural crowd, an effect not experienced in past inaugurations, he said. But this is not the case. Floor coverings were also used in 2013, and floor coverings remained on the Mall during the Women’s March on Washington the day after the inauguration. Spicer also blamed the ""first time"" usage of fencing and magnetometers on the Mall for ""preventing hundreds of thousands of people being able to access the Mall as quickly as they had inaugurations past."" According to a 2017 Congressional Research Service report, screening magnetometers, or metal detectors, have been used in past inaugurations, though it’s not clear if they were placed on the Mall itself. The screening zones, according to the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority, did include two busy metro stops close to the Mall. Spicer’s claim was also disputed by New York Times reporter Michael Schmidt, who tweeted that two unnamed law enforcement officials told him ""magnetometers were not used in the areas Spicer said they were on the Mall.""   Crowd size Spicer then knocked the press for tweeting out ""inaccurate numbers involving crowd size."" ""No one had numbers because the National Park Service, which controls the National Mall, does not put any out,"" he said.  ""We do know a few things. So let’s go through the facts."" ""We know that from the platform from where the President was sworn in to 4th Street holds about 250,000 people. From 4th Street to the media tent is about another 220,000. And from the media tent to the Washington Monument another 250,000 people. All of this space was full when the President took the oath of office."" Many news organizations, including PolitiFact, have noted that it’s difficult to gauge crowd size and that estimates are inconsistent. The National Park Service stopped tallying crowds on the National Mall in 1995 after a dispute over the attendance of the Million Man March. Spicer’s claim of full spaces on the Mall -- which photographs contradict -- would give Trump a crowd size of at least 720,000, which is higher than preliminary estimates reported in the media but are on par with the 700,000 to 900,000 organizers expected to attend. The President himself touted 1.5 million on Jan. 21 at CIA headquarters. But that still wouldn’t have been the top figure. Here are the attendance estimates for past inaugurations: Inauguration Estimated attendance  Trump, 2017 250,000 to 600,000 Barack Obama, 2013 1 million Obama, 2009 1.8 million George W. Bush, 2005 400,000 Bush, 2001 300,000 Bill Clinton, 1997 250,000 Clinton, 1993 800,000 George H.W. Bush, 1989 300,000 Metro ridership Spicer said 420,000 used the D.C. Metro public transit on Jan. 20, 2017, compared with  317,000 for President Obama’s 2013 inaugural. It’s unclear where his 420,000 figure for Trump’s inaugural comes from, but the Washington Post reported that for Trump’s inaugural around 570,557 took trips in the system between 4 a.m and midnight on Friday. Inauguration day 2013 drew more, at about 782,000. Spicer’s 317,000 figure refers to ridership as of 11 a.m. on Jan. 21, 2013, reported the WMATA. Trump’s inaugural drew about 193,000 as of the same time. Here’s a breakdown of ridership of the most recent inaugurations: Day Metro ridership (whole day) Metro ridership (as of 11 a.m.) Jan. 20, 2017 (Trump inaugural) 570,557 193,000 Jan. 21, 2013* (Obama inaugural) 782,000 317,000 Jan. 20, 2009 (Obama inaugural) 1,100,000 513,000 Jan. 20, 2005 (Bush inaugural) 583,803 197,000 *Note: Obama’s second inauguration was Jan. 21 instead of Jan. 20, which fell on a Sunday. Our ruling Spicer said, ""That was the largest audience to witness an inauguration, period."" To support his claim, Spicer offered a few pieces of misleading or inaccurate evidence. He said that floor coverings highlighting empty spaces on the National Mall were not used for previous inaugurations, but these were in place for Obama’s 2013 inauguration. He claimed metro ridership was higher for Trump’s inaugural than for Obama’s 2013 inaugural, but he compared numbers for the morning of Obama’s inaugural to the whole day for Trump’s. Spicer suggested 720,000 attended Trump’s inauguration, while organizers said they expected 700,000 to 900,000, and Trump himself estimated 1.5 million. All of those figures are less than the 1.8 million people who attended Obama’s 2009 inaugural.

Donald Trump says Navy has shrunk dramatically since 1991
","President Donald Trump has vowed to rebuild the U.S. military, which he said during his inauguration speech represented a ""sad depletion."" A page on foreign policy on the newly revamped Trump White House website includes some statistics about a shrinking military: ""Our Navy has shrunk from more than 500 ships in 1991 to 275 in 2016. Our Air Force is roughly one-third smaller than in 1991. President Trump is committed to reversing this trend, because he knows that our military dominance must be unquestioned."" The size of the Navy’s fleet has been a familiar talking point at least during the past two presidential campaigns. But many of the past claims we have fact-checked compared the fleet to 1917, or 100 years ago, when technology was considerably different. Trump’s claim is a more reasonable comparison. We found that his numbers are correct, and that there are valid concerns about the size of the Navy. The Obama administration supported an increase in the number of ships. Navy fleet size A Trump spokesman referred us to a Navy website, which shows the annual number of ships dating back to 1886. Trump’s numbers are accurate: In 1991 there were 529 total active ships, and in 2016 there were 275. The number of ships peaked at 6,768 during World War II. Then the number drifted down during most of the 20th century, with slight upticks during the Korean War and the Vietnam War. The number fluctuates a bit during each year as ships are rotated into and out of service. Lance Janda, a military historian at Cameron University, said Trump's claim requires further explanation. ""The thing is, numbers are not everything,"" Janda said. ""Ships today are much more expensive and more powerful than in the past, so it’s not like our Navy is less capable than it was in 1991. And it’s also a question of what kind of ships you want to have. We tend to have smaller numbers of really expensive, really capable ships. That’s nice when they work. It’s bad if you lose any."" While the size of the fleet has shrunk, it remains powerful compared with other countries. ""We remain the dominant Navy on the planet. Period,"" Janda said. ""I’d like to see us go with less expensive ships so we can have more of them myself, but it’s not like we’re in danger of being surpassed as a naval power. We face much greater threats in the realms of cyberwar, space war and nuclear weapons than we do at sea."" Michael O'Hanlon, a security expert at the Brookings Institution, a centrist-to-liberal group, agreed with that assessment. ""The point is that no single metric captures all important trends,"" he said. ""And the Navy has chosen to put more size, technology, and money into a smaller number of ships as a matter of policy.  And our aggregate tonnage is still almost three times China’s."" But Naval War College professor James Holmes said there are valid concerns about the Navy’s assets. (Holmes said he was speaking on behalf of himself and not the college.)  Navy leadership estimates it only has enough supply to meet 50 to 60 percent of the demand from U.S. regional commands around the world, he said. It’s more complex than just looking at the sheer number of ships, he said. The first step is to determine how many ships are needed to deploy for a particular situation -- for example if the United States gets into a scrap in the South China Sea. Then, if the Navy has a sufficient amount of naval power, then the Navy can handle that contingency. ""Technology has advanced in areas like electronic or cyber warfare and missile defense, so we're stronger in those areas,"" Holmes said. ""But we let a lot of basic skills and technologies atrophy after the Soviet Navy's demise in 1991. With no apparent foe to fight, we neglected combat skills such as fighting other surface fleets or hunting submarines."" Holmes was in the Navy of 1991 in a ship that carried Tomahawk anti-ship missiles that were able to strike at enemy vessels hundreds of miles away. ""That no longer exists, and we are worse off for it,"" he said. ""We converted all of those Tomahawks for land missions, e.g., strikes against ISIS today or Saddam's military in 2003."" A review by the conservative Heritage Foundation of the military branches concluded that the Navy scored strong in readiness but that deferred maintenance is beginning to affect deployment. Brian Slattery, Heritage Foundation’s Center for National Defense policy analyst, said that those who decry ship count as a valid measure of power ""discount that our adversaries’ and competitors’ navies have advanced, as well.  ""Even though American aircraft carriers are launching more sophisticated aircraft than they were decades ago, competitors such as China and Russia have developed new technologies to deny those carriers access to waters in their regions, including advanced anti-ship ballistic missiles, quiet diesel submarines, and their own modern aviation assets."" Former President Barack Obama has already begun the process of growing the Navy. The Obama White House embraced a long-term plan that would elevate the Navy to 300 active ships in 2019 and keep it at or above that level through 2045. The Navy completed a formal review process in 2014 to consider its future military needs, and then in March 2015 set a goal for a fleet of 308 ships. In December 2016, the secretary of the Navy announced a recommendation of a 355-ship fleet and plans to include that in the Navy’s Fiscal Year 2018 30-year shipbuilding plan. Our ruling The Trump White House website says that ""our Navy has shrunk from more than 500 ships in 1991 to 275 in 2016."" Trump’s numbers are correct according to a document from the Navy, which shows the annual size of the fleet. However, sheer numbers do not tell the full story. The ships of today are more powerful than those in 1991. The United States remains the world's most powerful Navy.

Trump wrongly says U.S. has made others rich while our wealth has 'dissipated'
","In his inaugural address, President Donald Trump painted a picture of a nation that has steadily marched down the wrong path. ""We’ve made other countries rich while the wealth, strength and confidence of our country has disappeared over the horizon,"" he said. ""One by one, the factories shuttered and left our shores, with not even a thought about the millions upon millions of American workers left behind. The wealth of our middle class has been ripped from their homes and then redistributed across the entire world."" Trump vowed to end this ""American carnage."" It’s tough to measure strength and confidence, but there are ways to measure wealth. We decided to look at whether America’s wealth has fallen while other countries became rich. Trump’s office told us he was thinking about America’s $800 billion trade deficit. However, trade deficits are not a measure of national or household wealth. There is no question that trade with China has cost America jobs to the benefit of Chinese workers. But again, Trump said we made other countries rich while our wealth faded and that’s a different point. Economists measure the wealth of nations in two ways. They look at the size of their economies, the GDP, and they look at how well the average citizen is doing, or GDP per capita. Through either lens, the wealth of the United States has not dissipated.   This chart comes from International Monetary Fund data. With its $18 trillion economy, the United States is a good one-third wealthier than its closest economic rival, China. China’s economy avoided the dip that the United States faced in the Great Recession, and it has grown at a faster rate, but America remains the wealthiest nation. Seen through the lens of GDP per capita (and factoring in the purchasing power of each currency), the United States looks even better compared to China, a country Trump often points to as the source of America’s woes. China ranks 83rd in the world on a per capita basis because while its economy is huge, it has about 1.3 billion people, many of whom are very poor. There is one way to look at the shifting economic fortunes of the typical adult that does express a sense of what Trump described. The international bank Credit Suisse has calculated adult wealth since 2000. Using their 2016 data, we find that the median wealth rose in each of the largest economies, including the United States, but it rose nearly three times faster in China than it did in the United States. Our ruling Trump said that other countries became rich while the wealth of America ""dissipated."" Based on the most common measures of national wealth, that is inaccurate. The United States has the world’s largest economy and, when averaged across the population, the typical American does better than the people of any other country. There is some argument to be made that the typcial Chinese worker's wealth has gone up much faster than the typical American's, but the American is still much wealthier.

"['Housing', 'Poverty', 'California', 'Chad Mayes']","
TRUE: California has the nation’s highest poverty rate, when factoring in cost-of-living
"," California’s job and economic growth has outpaced much of the nation in recent years. That growth, however, has not eliminated one of the state’s biggest challenges: poverty. This week, State Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes called poverty California’s No. 1 priority during a forum of legislative leaders in Sacramento. Mayes, who represents parts of San Bernardino and Riverside counties, claimed the state’s poverty rate is higher than any state in the nation when considering factors such as cost-of-living. ""If you look at the official poverty measure in California, we’re about average with the rest of the country,"" Mayes said. ""But if you use the supplemental poverty measure, we are in the lead. We have the highest poverty rate in the nation -- higher than New Mexico, higher than any of the southern states, Louisiana, Alabama, higher than Idaho.""  Assemblyman Chad Mayes makes his statement about poverty in California at about the 10:50 minute mark in the video above.  We decided to fact-check whether the report Mayes cited really shows that California has the highest poverty rate in the nation. Our research From 2013 to 2015, California had America’s 17th-highest poverty rate, 15 percent, according to the U.S. Census Bureau’s Official Poverty Measure. That measure uses income levels to determine poverty, but does not consider differences in cost-of-living among states. It lists the official poverty threshold for a two-adult, two-child family at $24,036 in 2015. During the same period, California had the highest poverty rate, 20.6 percent, according to the census’ Supplemental Poverty Measure. That study does account for cost-of-living, including taxes, housing and medical costs, and is considered by researchers a more accurate reflection of poverty. For a two-adult, two-child family in California, the poverty threshold was an average of $30,000, depending on the region in the state, according to a 2014 analysis by Public Policy Institute of California. Looking at state poverty rates, the second highest is Florida’s 19 percent, followed by New York’s and Louisiana’s shared 17.9 percent rate. The national average is 15.1 percent using the supplemental measure. ""I think Assemblymember Mayes’ comments are accurate,"" said Chris Hoene, executive director of the left-leaning California Budget Policy Center, which has closely studied poverty in the state. Hoene said the high poverty rate in the supplemental report is driven by California’s stratospheric housing costs. He added that use of the supplemental measure has gained wide acceptance among researchers. ""I think in most quarters, that’s not disputed,"" he said. Marybeth Mattingly, a researcher at the Stanford Center on Poverty and Inequality added by email: ""Basically, yes, this statement is (sadly) accurate."" Caroline Danielson, who studies poverty at the Public Policy Institute of California, noted that when considering the margin of error in the supplemental poverty report, California and Florida are closer than one might assume. California’s estimate has a margin of error of ± 0.8 percent while Florida’s had a margin of ± 1.1 percent. ""California’s rate is essentially the same as Florida’s,"" she said. ""California, we might say, is in the top two."" Several researchers noted that California’s poverty rate has declined in recent years: ""But they haven’t moved as much as you would hope,"" Hoene said. Our ruling State Assembly Republican Leader Chad Mayes said recently that California has ""the highest poverty rate in the nation"" when considering the U.S. Census Bureau’s Supplemental Poverty Measure. Data from that report, and researchers who study poverty, support Mayes’ statement. The state’s 20.6 percent poverty rate is higher than any other, though Florida’s 19 percent rate is close, especially when considering the margin of error. The supplemental report is considered by experts the best state-by-state measure of poverty, because it takes into account geographic differences in cost-of-living, not just income levels. In his statement, Mayes cited the specific report that backs his claim, and added the context that another report, one that doesn’t account for cost-of-living, shows California’s poverty closer to the national average. Given this clarity and context, we rate Mayes' statement True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

"['Families', 'Income', 'Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Peter Barca']","
Citing old data, Wisconsin lawmaker says the state's middle class is 'most diminished' in U.S.
","The drumbeat has been steady for months: State Assembly Minority Leader Peter Barca (D-Kenosha) and other Democrats in the Legislature have repeatedly said that Wisconsin has the ""most diminished middle class"" in the United States. As recently as Jan. 10, Barca recited the claim in a news release and said it three times in less than a minute while talking with reporters. ""We have the most diminished middle class in the entire country,"" Barca said at a Capitol news conference in response to Republican Gov. Scott Walker’s 2017 ""state of the state"" speech. ""Let me say that again: We have the most diminished middle class in the entire country."" Barca later added: ""We believe we should be focused on the most diminished middle class in the country."" Other Assembly members have echoed the line. State Rep. David Bowen (D-Milwaukee) said in a December radio address that Wisconsin ""is still home to the most diminished middle class in the country."" The same month, state Rep. Leon Young (D-Milwaukee) wrote that Wisconsin ""has the dubious distinction of having the most diminished middle class in the country."" That repeated assertion piqued our interest. So we investigated: Does Wisconsin really have the ""most diminished middle class"" in the United States? New data, different outcome We asked Barca for evidence to support his claim that Wisconsin has the ""most diminished middle class"" in the country. A spokeswoman pointed to a 2015 analysis by the Pew Research Center — a nonpartisan research organization — that showed middle class households in Wisconsin shrank the most of any state between 2000 and 2013. The analysis found that in 2000, an estimated 54.6 percent of households in Wisconsin were considered middle class. By 2013, that figure fell to 48.9 percent, a 5.7 percentage point drop and the largest decline of any state, according to Pew. To conduct that analysis, Pew used data from the American Community Survey, a national survey administered by the U.S. Census Bureau as well as IPUMS-USA data compiled by the University of Minnesota. Pew defined ""middle class"" as those households earning between 67 percent and 200 percent of the state’s median income. But here’s the problem: Pew’s analysis only went through 2013, and more recent numbers are available. So we performed the same analysis as Pew but included data for the latest year available, 2015. We found that in 2015, an estimated 50.1 percent of households in Wisconsin were considered middle class by Pew’s standards. That’s 4.5 percentage points smaller compared to 2000, when an estimated 54.6 percent of households in the state were considered middle class. It was the 10th steepest decline in percentage of middle class households between 2000 and 2015 of any state, with Nevada’s drop the most significant at 5.6 percentage points. So, by the latest numbers, Barca is not correct. What’s behind the numbers? Wisconsin was one of 18 states where the share of middle-class households grew slightly from 2010 to 2015. In that time period, the percentage of households in Wisconsin considered middle class increased to 50.1 percent — a 0.7 point gain. Overall in 2015, Wisconsin ranked fifth in the nation in percentage of households that were middle class. Thus, while Wisconsin had the biggest decline of middle class households between 2000 and 2013, its performance in recent years shifts the outcome. Our rating Barca said Wisconsin has ""the most diminished middle class"" in the United States. An analysis by a respected, nonpartisan research organization found the percentage of middle class households in Wisconsin declined the most of any state between 2000 and 2013. But in the latest version of that analysis — comparing the years 2000 and 2015 — middle class households in Wisconsin did not shrink the most of any state.

"['Illinois', 'Jason  Keller ']","
AFL-CIO legislative director points to untraceable data
","More people are leaving Illinois than any other state in the country. Recently released data from the U.S. Census Bureau shows Illinois experienced the biggest mid-year population loss of any state between 2015 and 2016. In the past year, 37,508 people left Illinois, making it one of seven states that saw a population drop. Does that mean businesses are leaving, too? According to the Illinois AFL-CIO’s legislative director Jason Keller, businesses are actually sticking around. Keller countered a claim often made by business groups that businesses and jobs are leaving Illinois and perpetuating the overall population loss. Keller said: ""I would like to challenge something one of the members here spoke to, that businesses are leaving Illinois. I think, statistically, that can be proven to be false through the Bureau of Labor Statistics. No net businesses have left Illinois."" We investigated whether this Bureau of Labor Statistics data existed and could support Keller’s claim.
  The context The cost of workers' compensation insurance for businesses in Illinois has been one of the lightning rod issues in Illinois politics since Gov. Bruce Rauner took office two years ago. Rauner, business groups, and Republicans in the General Assembly say Illinois' system is slanted heavily against businesses and has contributed to an exodus of businesses to neighboring states with lower workers' compensation insurance rates. During a debate on a workers' compensation reform bill, Rep. Dwight Kay, R-Glen Carbon, cited Illinois' No. 8 ranking in a study of state's compensation premium index rates from the Oregon Department of Consumer Business Services. Kay linked it to recent population loss figures and suggested the state might continue to see people, and eventually businesses, move out of state. ""How many employees are going to be left because employers leave?"" Kay asked one witness. When it was Keller’s turn to speak, he tried to dismantle Kay’s assertion that businesses are leaving Illinois, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data and saying there was no net loss of Illinois businesses. Digging into BLS data We asked Keller where he obtained this BLS business data. We also asked him to clarify the time frame he was referring to. At the time of the hearing, he said no net businesses left Illinois, but he did not say when. He responded that it’s on the BLS website and instructed us to ""run the reports."" When we couldn't find BLS data on business departures, we contacted the bureau's economist, Drake Gibson. Gibson said BLS doesn't track interstate relocations of businesses. ""We track things like business deployment dynamics, net losses and jobs, closures and openings. But we don’t show businesses leaving from one state to another,"" Gibson said. Gibson suggested we contact the Illinois Department of Employment Security. We contacted IDES along with several other public and private organizations. None of them track when businesses leave the state. Is this data even available? Keller’s claim raises another question: Does anyone track the movement of Illinois businesses when they cross state lines?   Darren Lubotsky, associate professor with an expertise in the American labor market at the Institute of Government & Public Affairs at the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign, said the data Keller referred to is loosely available, but no organization actually cobbles it together into a comprehensive report. For example, Lubotsky said if someone was interested enough they could use U.S. Census Bureau data to find this information. Or, if they had the means, someone could track Social Security or tax identification numbers to see where businesses were located over the course of time. Lubotsky said that information isn’t neatly packaged. An interested party would have to check each business individually by year. Lubotsky said he’s always skeptical when people make claims similar to the one Keller made. ""People like to use the latest population estimates kind of like a score,"" Lubotsky said. ""Using population numbers or businesses figures are the types of things people cherry pick to make their point. I’ve never seen any serious analysis of these sort of things."" Even if Illinois was losing a net number of businesses, he said it’s more important to view Illinois’ economic landscape as a whole. ""We always hear about manufacturing jobs leaving the state. Maybe that’s the case, but maybe they’re being replaced by IT firms,"" Lubotsky said. ""The net number of businesses might be lower, but the businesses might be higher in productivity."" Lubotsky makes a point. While no known organizations track when a business moves across state lines, BLS does track the net number of businesses in each state. According to employment and wages data, Illinois businesses were growing for nearly a decade before declining in 2015. These figures, however, indicate only the total number of businesses year to year. They offer no insight on business departures to other states.  Our ruling  During a House Labor & Commerce Committee meeting, the Illinois AFL-CIO’s legislative director Jason Keller said, ""I would like to challenge something one of the members here spoke to, that businesses are leaving Illinois. I think, statistically, that can be proven to be false through the Bureau of Labor Statistics. No net businesses have left Illinois."" We reached out to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, where an economist told us BLS does not track when businesses move in and out of state. We contacted several other private and public organizations we thought might track this data. What Keller said would be at BLS was neither there nor anywhere else we checked. Someone wishing to track and compile business moves would need individual business records or tax identification numbers to do so, Lubotsky said. Based on the lack of evidence and the impracticality of compiling the numbers Keller said could be found at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2017/jan/19/jason-keller/afl-cio-director-points-to-untraceable-data/
"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Poverty', 'States', 'North Carolina', 'Taxes', 'Roy Cooper']","
NC Gov. Roy Cooper on Medicaid expansion in North Carolina: ""You're already paying for it.""
","One of Gov. Roy Cooper’s arguments for accepting an expansion of Medicaid health care coverage into North Carolina is that the state is already paying into the program – and thus might as well get something out of it. The Medicaid expansion debate is currently the subject of a court battle between Cooper ( a Democrat) and the state’s Republican-led legislature. Meanwhile, the governor is trying to drum up support for expansion. ""You’re already paying for it,"" Cooper told a meeting of business officials on Jan. 4. ""North Carolina is paying federal taxes that is going to other states (for Medicaid). There have been conservative Republican governors like Mike Pence, who is our vice president, like Chris Christie, like John Kasich, who understood that this was an economic decision for their state and that it was important to do. So we’re already paying for it. The decision has been made."" It’s common knowledge that many Republican governors have accepted the Medicaid expansion, and Cooper is right that Indiana, New Jersey and Ohio all accepted the expansion under conservative leadership. We’re more interested in the claim that North Carolina is paying for a program that gives it nothing in return. Two versions of Medicaid The expansion of Medicaid – which the Affordable Care Act made possible – is a separate piece of the regular Medicaid program. North Carolina has been part of the regular Medicaid program since 1970. But it remains one of 18 states that have not accepted the expansion. Medicaid provides government health insurance for low-income people. In 2015, the state reported, 1.8 million North Carolinians were enrolled – most of them children. The expansion would cover people who don’t qualify for either the Affordable Care Act health care subsidies or for regular Medicaid coverage. The state pays about one-fourth of the costs for regular Medicaid expenses in North Carolina, according to the N.C. General Assembly Fiscal Research Division. The federal government pays 60 percent, and the rest is funded by drug companies and other sources. In 2015, when the bill came out to $13.8 billion for North Carolina, the state paid $3.7 billion. But that’s not what Cooper is talking about. He’s referring to the optional expansion of Medicaid – which North Carolina and 17 other states have so far declined to accept. And Cooper is right that, nevertheless, North Carolinians are paying for the expansion in other states. The expansion is funded almost entirely by the federal government – 95 percent now, and dropping to 90 percent by 2020. ""Right now, North Carolina tax dollars are going to Washington, where they are being redistributed to states that have expanded Medicaid,"" Cooper said in a written statement after his speech. But is he right? The federal government does get a lot of money from taxes. But it also makes money from fees, leases, investments and other sources. The government also engages in deficit spending. With all those non-tax options, we wondered about Cooper’s claim. Digging into the numbers According to a 2015 report from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Medicaid expansion in the decade from 2015-24 is estimated to cost $717 billion. That includes $667 billion from the federal government. And Cooper is right that the cost falls onto states, including those that haven’t expanded the program. In fact, North Carolina taxpayers are likely paying more than $1 billion dollars a year into the program. Donald Taylor, a Duke University professor and health care policy expert, said the federal government’s share of Medicaid expansion (unlike the regular Medicaid program) is mostly funded by income taxes and new taxes the ACA created. For overall taxes as well as income tax in particular, North Carolina’s people and businesses contribute 2.4 percent of the federal government’s tax revenue – at least as of the 2014 fiscal year, which is the most recent state-by-state IRS data available. Going by the HHS report that estimated $667 billion in federal spending on Medicaid expansion over a decade, 2.4 percent is $16 billion. That’s $1.6 billion per year, on average. In reality, of course, government accountants don’t go through taxpayers’ checks to see which ones come from which state and then apportion out funds that way. So the 2.4 percent number is the state’s approximate share, not an actual bill. And it’s possible that figures from the 2014 tax data and 2015 Medicaid cost study could have changed by now, or might fluctuate in the future. Regardless, Cooper is certainly right that North Carolinians are paying into this program. Another interpretation However, there’s a second way that a listener might interperet Cooper’s claim – that by telling people ""you’re already paying for it,"" he’s implying that North Carolina could accept the expansion of Medicaid with no further costs. That is not accurate. Yes, North Carolina is paying into Medicaid, but the state’s costs would absolutely rise if it were to accept the expansion. In various studies by researchers from Georgetown University and the Wake Forest University School of Law, and depending on whether the federal government is paying for 90 or 95 percent of the costs, estimates show North Carolina’s state government would be on the hook for between $210 million and $600 million per year in the near future if it did expand Medicaid. The federal government would also pitch in billions more each year, those studies estimate, of which North Carolina taxpayers – as we already explored – would be responsible for tens of millions of dollars. Our ruling Roy Cooper said North Carolinians are ""already paying for"" Medicaid expansion, even though the state hasn’t expanded Medicaid. He was arguing for the state to go ahead and accept the expansion. He’s right that North Carolinians are already paying into the program, via federal taxes. Yet what he doesn’t mention is that the state government currently pays nothing into the program but would have to pay hundreds of millions of dollars per year if it did accept the expansion. Doing so would also increase the federal tax burden on people all over the country, including in North Carolina.

"['Education', 'Pennsylvania', 'Bob Casey']","
Trump's education pick donated to Philly group with controversial campus rape stance
","President-elect Donald Trump’s pick to lead the Department of Education is facing questions about her connections to an organization that has lobbied for more rights for college students accused of sexual assault. U.S. Sen. Bob Casey, a Pennsylvania Democrat who co-introduced the Campus Sexual Violence Elimination Act of 2013, Tuesday questioned Michigan billionaire and GOP donor Betsy DeVos about how to fight sexual violence on campus during a confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions. Specifically, Casey said the Philadelphia-based Foundation for Individual Rights in Education supports a bill that ""would change the standard of evidence."" He said the group is in favor of ditching the ""preponderance of the evidence"" standard most commonly used in Title IX investigations on college campuses and instead using the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard used in criminal cases. But Casey went further, saying just before he ran out of time: ""The organization that has that position which is contrary to the law, the current law, and contrary to the spirit of what we’re trying to do in that piece of legislation, is the recipient of donations from you totaling about $25,000 bucks over four years… I hope that’s not a conflict of interest."" DeVos didn’t have time to respond, though a Trump transition team spokeswoman said ""had she been given the opportunity to respond to the Senator's question, she would have noted that previous donations made as a private citizen cannot present a conflict of interest."" Casey announced Wednesday he will vote against DeVos' nomination. But we were curious: Did DeVos donate to a group that wants to dismantle current campus sexual assault practices as he described? So we decided to check. First, some background. Some studies suggest one in five women are sexually assaulted before they graduate college. PolitiFact has found that it’s difficult to determine the number of sexual assaults on college campuses because underreporting is so pervasive. Casey’s bill that was passed in 2013, commonly known as the Campus SaVE Act, was passed as part of the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act. It was an update to the 1990 Jeanne Clery Act, which requires any college or university that receives federal funding to annually disclose campus crime, including reported incidents of sexual violence. The Campus SaVE Act doesn’t dictate what standard of evidence college campuses use to evaluate disciplinary action against a person accused of sexual assault. It only requires transparency and that schools disclose what standard of evidence they’re using. In 2011 though, a ""Dear Colleague"" letter released by the Office of Civil Rights in the Department of Education urged universities to adopt a preponderance of the evidence standard in the commission of Title IX investigations. This standard, which is used in civil litigation, is lower than the ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" standard used in criminal trials and requires those evaluating the claims find that it’s simply more likely than not that a violation occurred. For the most part, Democrats and women’s advocacy groups have lobbied in favor of asking colleges and universities to use the preponderance of the evidence standard during disciplinary proceedings and Title IX investigations. Other groups, including the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education, say that standard strips away a student’s right to due process. The group is sponsoring a lawsuit that challenges the legality of the ""Dear Colleague"" guidance. FIRE, founded in 1999, says its mission is to ""defend and sustain individual rights at America’s colleges and universities"" including ""freedom of speech, legal equality, due process, religious liberty, and sanctity of conscience."" During the hearing Tuesday, Casey said FIRE received $25,000 from ""you,"" referring to DeVos, over the course of four years. A spokeswoman for Casey said the claim came from staff research based on publicly available IRS filings made by the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation, a nonprofit founded by DeVos and her husband that dispenses millions of dollars a year in charitable and political giving. Indeed, filings by the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation show the organization donated $25,000 to FIRE over the course of four years between 2010 and 2013 in four separate donations. The forms also list the couple as the sole donors to the foundation. The foundation and Trump’s transition team did not respond to a request for comment. It’s important to note that the $25,000 in donations is a fraction of the money dispensed by the Dick and Betsy DeVos Family Foundation in the years in question. The foundation routinely doles out more than $10 million a year in contributions to charities and conservative causes across the country. FIRE has faced criticism from women’s advocacy organizations for its stance on issues related to sexual assault on campuses. The group frequently represents students accused of sexual assault who have lodged complaints against institutions of higher education and has been critical of the White House Task Force on Campus Sexual Assault, saying it jeopardizes student due process. The nonprofit has come out against measures like California’s ""Yes Means Yes"" affirmative consent bill, a piece of legislation hailed by women’s advocacy groups. FIRE also posted a story on its website in 2011 titled ""The Politics of Campus Sexual Assault"" in which the author writes that ""much of the feminist ‘war on rape’ has conflated sexual assault with muddled, often alcohol-fueled, sexual encounters that involve miscommunication, perhaps bad behavior, but no criminal coercion."" FIRE released a statement on DeVos’ nomination, saying: ""Protecting civil liberties on campus is not, and must not become, a partisan issue."" The group wrote that while it’s most famous for its work protecting free speech on campus, it has ""long advocated for due process rights in campus proceedings more generally."" Samantha Harris, FIRE's vice president of policy research, said the organization doesn't advocate for a specific standard of evidence, but rather ""we don't think the federal government should mandate a standard."" ""When it comes to due process, it's really not a zero sum game,"" Harris said. ""It's not the rights of the accused versus victims' rights. The integrity of the process is important for everyone."" Our Ruling U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, during a confirmation hearing for Secretary of Education pick Betsy DeVos, said ""[The Foundation for Individual Rights] is the recipient of donations from you (DeVos) totaling about 25,000 bucks over four years."" IRS filings show those numbers check out.

TRUE: California’s uninsured rate has hit 'historic low'
","As Republicans in Washington D.C. move ahead with plans to dismantle Obamacare, California Gov. Jerry Brown is pushing back with claims the federal health care law has boosted health coverage in the state. Brown said California’s uninsured rate is at ""a historic low."" ""The uninsured rate in California has gone down from 17.2 percent in 2013 to a historic low of 7.4 percent in 2016."" Brown made this and other statements about the law’s effect on California in a letter to GOP House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy of Bakersfield on Jan. 13, 2017. McCarthy had asked Brown for recommendations on changing the law, formally known as the Affordable Care Act.  We wanted to know whether Brown’s claim about ""a historic low"" was accurate. We set out on a fact check. Our research Gov. Brown’s office cited data from the U.S. Census Bureau and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that confirm the uninsured rates cited for 2013 and 2016. The 7.4 percent uninsured rate was reported in a survey covering January through June of 2016 by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. It represents the rate for all ages in California. The same survey cites an 8.4 percent uninsured rate for Californians under 65 years of age. The ‘all ages’ uninsured rate is slightly lower because it includes the 65 and older population, the vast majority of which has health insurance through Medicare. The governor’s office also cited several sources as evidence that California’s uninsured rate has reached ""a historic low."" Those include a health care almanac maintained by the California Health Care Foundation. It shows the state’s uninsured rate from 1987 to 2015 for Californians under 65, though not the rate for all ages. In 1987, it was 17.6 percent.  California's uninsured rate hovered near 20 percent during the 1990s and 2000s before declining sharply in recent years as the Affordable Care Act took effect. The foundation described the state’s 2015 uninsured rate of 8.5 percent for Californians under 65 as ""a historic low."" Deborah Kelch, executive director of the Sacramento-based Insure the Uninsured Project, noted there are many different ways to measure California’s uninsured rate. But no matter which source is examined, she said, ""I think it’s fair to say we have reached a historic low of the uninsured."" In an interview, Shana Charles, faculty associate at the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research, also described current uninsured rates as ""historic lows."" Charles said there wasn’t much tracking of the state’s uninsured rate before the 1990s, adding coverage ""certainly wasn’t better"" in past decades. She said there’s been ""a slow expansion"" of health coverage over time in California and across the country since Medicare and Medicaid were enacted in the 1960s. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown claimed California’s uninsured rate in 2016 was ""a historic low"" at 7.4 percent. As evidence, his office pointed to the 7.4 percent uninsured rate reported in a survey covering the first half of 2016 by the CDC’s National Center for Health Statistics. That rate is for all ages in California. When discussing this topic, many researchers cite the uninsured rate for Californians under 65, which was slightly higher at 8.4 percent. Even at that rate, it would be an historic low. Data for that rate is more widely available. A health care almanac shows the state’s uninsured rate for Californians under 65 hovered near 20 percent during the 1990s and 2000s before dropping sharply in recent years. Its records go back to 1987 when that rate was 17.6 percent. Researchers who study California’s uninsured rate say this measurement was not closely tracked before the 1980s, but said the rate was certainly not lower in past decades. No matter how you measure it, they added, the uninsured rate in California has reached an historic low. We rate Brown's claim True.

"['Jobs', 'Wisconsin', 'Mark Pocan']","
Pocan wrongly claims 'in the last decade, 73% of new jobs' in Wisconsin 'have come from Madison'
","After another congressman slammed Madison as a ""communist"" city, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, D-Madison, offered up a defense built on the city’s economic muscle. The spat began when U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, a Republican, referred to the ""progressive, liberal, communist community of Madison"" while discussing how Dane County opted for a hand tally during the presidential recount. The comments came in a December appearance on Tucker Carlson Tonight on Fox News. Duffy implied on Twitter he was joking, but Pocan wasn’t laughing. The Democrat went on the same show Dec. 8, 2016, to demand an apology and defend the state’s capital city. ""In the last decade, 73 percent of new jobs (in Wisconsin) have come from Madison,"" Pocan said in the appearance. ""I don’t know if that’s exactly the way I look at communists. We actually have a very vibrant private sector."" Is one Wisconsin city really responsible for nearly three-fourths of the job growth over the last 10 years? Let's check the numbers. Problems with geography, specificity The claim runs into immediate trouble since Pocan referred to the wrong geographic area. Spokesman David Kolovson said Pocan meant to say Dane County was responsible for 73% of jobs, not Madison. He noted two news releases Pocan issued on the topic attributed that number to Dane County. Slightly more than half of Dane County lives outside Madison, so it’s an important difference. Pocan also referred on TV to ""73 percent of new jobs,"" when the figures he is citing actually address net job growth. Pocan’s phrasing implies he has data on where each new job in the state was created, when he is actually referring to the change in total employment — how many people had jobs at one point in time compared to another. Job figures don’t match Pocan’s claim As for the 73 percent figure, let’s first look at what Pocan actually said — that the City of Madison was responsible for 73 percent of growth. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates Madison added a net of 13,000 jobs from 2006-’16, while the state added 87,000. That would be 15 percent of the statewide growth — far less than Pocan asserted. Those numbers come from the bureau’s Local Area Unemployment Statistics, which uses household-level data and surveys to estimate the labor force, employment and unemployment numbers. It’s the only dataset with city-level data. But what about the number Pocan was intending to cite (and did cite in news releases), attributing the increase to Dane County? It’s closer, but still off. Bureau of Labor Statistics Economist Steve Hipple said a different dataset, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, is the best measure of job growth. That is based on state unemployment insurance filings and produces county and state-level employment figures. The latest available employment data, through the second quarter of 2016, shows Dane County is responsible for 58 percent of the state’s job growth from 2006-’16. Dan Kennelly, manager of Madison’s Office of Business Resources, said the number is that high largely due to the Great Recession. Dane County was significantly less affected than the rest of the state, he said. ""If you look at more recent years, the statewide numbers look significantly stronger compared to Dane County,"" Kennelly said. ""This is likely because while Dane County’s economy stayed relatively strong through the recession, the statewide economy took a bigger dive and therefore had a deeper hole to climb out of during the recovery over the last few years."" Kolovson, the Pocan spokesman, said the 73 percent figure came from a presentation made by Madison city development officials at a September 2014 symposium. That presentation said 73 percent of ""net new jobs"" created in Wisconsin from 2004-’14 were in Dane County. So the data is at least two years old, and not in line with Pocan’s reference to it as being ""in the last decade."" And the number is wrong for that timespan anyhow. Kennelly, who did the calculations behind the 73 percent figure, said he used the same Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages. But the symposium occurred with three months left in 2014. Full-year data for 2004-14 shows Dane County accounted for 55 percent of the job growth statewide in that span. Our rating In his defense of Madison, Pocan highlighted the area’s job creation by saying the city is responsible for 73 percent of new jobs in the state over the last decade. But his claim attributed Dane County data to Madison, referred to ""new jobs"" when he meant job growth and was built on two-year-old data that is wrong itself. We rate his claim False.",/factchecks/2017/jan/19/mark-pocan/pocan-wrongly-claims-last-decade-73-new-jobs-wisco/
