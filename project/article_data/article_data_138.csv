UNC football coach says it's not 'proven' football causes CTE
","Football is under attack. That’s what Larry Fedora, head coach of the UNC football team, told reporters during an ACC media event on July 18. Without naming anyone, Fedora said ""people twist the data"" on football-related injuries to argue that the game isn’t safe. Football is safer than it has ever been, he said, adding that reports of the game’s ties to head injuries are overblown. ""I don’t think it’s been proven that the game of football causes CTE,"" Fedora said. CTE is short for chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a progressive degenerative brain disease linked to head trauma. ""Now we do know, from my understanding, that repeated blows to the head causes it,"" Fedora said. ""So I’m assuming, every sport that you have, football included, could be a problem with that. As long as you’ve got any kind of contact, you can have that."" Fedora is right about CTE being caused by blows to the head. But is he right that researchers haven’t ""proven"" that football causes CTE? Through a spokeswoman, he declined PolitiFact’s request to elaborate on his claim. But PolitiFact found that Fedora’s point is somewhat valid. Scientists have suspected a link between football and brain problems for decades. However, research into the whether the sport consistently causes CTE hasn’t gotten very far. 110 of 111 brains CTE cannot be diagnosed in someone until they die, so it’s impossible at this point for doctors and scientists to measure football’s effect on the human brain on a year-to-year basis. The most illuminating information emerged in 2017. That year, the Journal of the American Medical Association published the work of researchers who studied the brains of deceased football players who played at various levels, from high school to college to semi-pro and the NFL. In total, nearly 88 percent of the brains — 177 of 202 — submitted for the research tested positive for CTE. But the rate of CTE was lower in younger players. (NPR summarized the research.) ▪ Of the 14 players who played only in high school, just three had CTE. ▪ Of the 53 players who stopped playing after college, 48 had CTE. ▪ Of the 22 players who played in the Canadian Football League or a semi-pro league, 16 had CTE. ▪ Of the 111 players who played in the NFL, 110 had CTE. (An NFL player may have a higher risk of CTE if he began playing as a child. A separate study, published in 2014, found that former NFL players who started playing football before age 12 fared worse on cognitive assessments than players who started in their teens, as Vox explained this year.) Dr. Ann McKee, one of the researchers who conducted the 2017 study published in JAMA, said those results show a link between football and CTE. ""We’re seeing this (CTE) in a very large number that participated in football for many years. So while we don’t know the exact risk and we don’t know the exact number, we know this is a problem in football,"" she told NPR. But each of the brains was donated, leaving some researchers divided on how to characterize football’s ties to CTE. Sampling bias Dr. Peter Cummings, forensic pathologist and a neuropathologist at Boston University School of Medicine, wrote in a 2017 Yahoo Sports column that McKee’s study doesn’t definitively prove a link between football and CTE. He noted the brains were donated by families who likely suspected the player had developed neurological problems. ""Because of this sampling bias, we cannot estimate the prevalence or incidence of CTE (meaning the total number of cases and the number of new cases expected each year in football players); nor can we establish risk or a cause-effect relationship between head injury and development of CTE,"" Cummings wrote. ""To do that you need a randomly selected population comprised of people with the disease and people without the disease,"" he said. ""In other words, we do not have a complete picture of what causes CTE, how common CTE is, or what the chance of getting CTE may be for anyone, or even what symptoms, if any, CTE causes."" Another recent Yahoo Sports column quotes Cummings defending Fedora, saying that ""association is not causation."" The same column refers to CTE researchers in Canada, who warn that the most commonly cited studies on the disease ""do not allow for the collection of any epidemiological data and are not representative of the general population."" The studies are ""limited by methodological biases, pathological inconsistencies, insufficient clinical data, and a reliance on inherently biased postmortem data,"" their abstract says. The burden of proof Lewis Margolis, a pediatrician and epidemiologist at the University of North Carolina’s Gillings School of Global Public Health, said he generally agrees with Cummings and others that the scientific proof has yet to be determined. ""Has there been a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial where some boys are exposed to brain trauma and other boys are not and then later examined for CTE? The answer is no,"" Margolis said in an email. ""Such a trial would not be ethical."" UNC has a research center dedicated to studying the link between contact sports and head injuries. Its research shows a clear relationship between football and brain trauma, Margolis said. ""The implication of the statement by Fedora is that because we do not have the definitive (randomized controlled trial) for CTE we cannot say that football causes CTE. To me this misses that point that football increases the risk of head trauma/concussions with known consequences, even if there is not a definitive link (yet) to CTE,"" he said. Margolis has warned that players or parents who are waiting for definitive, scientific proof could be putting themselves or their kids at risk. ""The tobacco industry used to say that the relationship between smoking and lung cancer was ‘merely’ a statistical association, similar to saying that there is not proof that football causes CTE,"" Margolis said. ""The weight of the evidence against tobacco eventually tipped the scales, absent randomized trials, and I think the weight of the evidence of the harms of football is similar, even without a definitive link to CTE."" NFL acknowledgment Back to Cummings and the lack of a valid scientific study proving that football causes CTE. The NFL, which has been accused of suppressing information about how the sport affects players’ long-term health, could use the same argument. And, for a while, it did. (""Frontline"" in 2013 published a timeline showing key events and research dating back to 1994.) In 2013, while admitting no wrongdoing, the NFL reached a $765 million settlement with former players after 4,500 of them sued the NFL on the basis that the league minimized the risk of concussions. (Amid a challenge, the settlement was later upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court.) Then in March 2016, for the first time, the NFL publicly acknowledged a link between football and CTE. The statement came while Jeff Miller, the NFL’s senior vice president of health and safety policy, was part of a round-table discussion with the U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce. Miller pointed to McKee’s work as evidence. And the NFL released a statement the day after Miller’s claim, saying his comments ""accurately reflect the view of the NFL."" Our rating Fedora said it hasn’t been ""proven that the game of football causes CTE."" He’s right that there hasn’t been a controlled study showing, conclusively, that playing football directly causes CTE. However, studies have shown CTE in the brains of more than 100 former football players, and the NFL has acknowledged a link between football and CTE. There’s enough evidence to show a connection between football and CTE. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2018/jul/26/larry-fedora/unc-football-coach-says-its-not-proven-football-ca/

Could Trump tax cut save up to $44,697 per family?
","As Republican lawmakers seek to gain momentum for ""tax cut 2.0"" -- legislation to expand the tax law signed in December by President Donald Trump -- they have returned to tax-related messaging. One tweet by a prominent House Republican latched on to a new study of the tax law’s impact. On July 23, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., sent a tweet touting the benefits of the tax changes, which were passed exclusively with Republican support. ""ZERO Democrats voted for this → ‘Trump tax cut benefits all congressional districts, up to $44,697 per family,’"" McCarthy tweeted. ZERODemocrats voted for this → ""Trump tax cut benefits all congressional districts, up to $44,697 per family"" https://t.co/cwFuydNS4p The tweet links to an article about a study by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, that had been released that same day. The gist of the Heritage study is that, thanks to the tax law, ""in 2018, taxpayers will save an average of $1,400, and married couples with two children will save $2,917. Over the next 10 years, because of a larger economy driven by tax cuts and the tax cuts themselves, the typical American household will benefit from more than $26,000 more in take-home pay, or $44,697 for a family of four."" We don’t doubt that taxpayers in every congressional district will benefit in some way from the tax law. However, McCarthy glosses over some of the study’s nuances. Let’s take a closer look. The word to focus on in the Heritage study is ""average."" It appears 121 times in the 27-page report. By contrast, the term ""median"" doesn’t appear at all. Here’s why that matters. When you compute an average (specifically, the ""mean"") of a set of numbers, you calculate the sum of everything, then divide that by the number of items. But when you compute the median, you line up all of the items from smallest to largest, then choose the midpoint. For something like the tax bill, which has significantly different impacts on different types of taxpayers, the measurement you use can make a significant difference. As we have noted, the tax law provides a disproportionate share of its benefits to wealthier taxpayers. Lower- and middle-income taxpayers do get tax cuts under the law -- something we’ve fact-checked Democrats for downplaying -- but all told, the tax bill does skew favorably toward the wealthy. That’s not a surprise -- under the United States’ progressive tax system, richer taxpayers foot a disproportionate share of the tax bill. Still, it’s a notable feature of the law. Here’s an analysis of the size of the average tax cut for each income group, compiled by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. For 2018, the average tax cut for the middle 20 percent of the income scale is $780. That’s much less than it is for the top one-fifth of the income scale -- $5,790 -- and compared to the top 1 percent, at $32,650, it’s positively paltry. In Heritage’s methodology, these very large tax refunds are factored into the calculations. If a median had been used, the expansionary effect of those large amounts on the ""typical"" figure would have been muted. ""Because of the high-dollar value of the tax cuts received by many wealthy households and the fact that there are fewer wealthy households than low-income households, the average tax cut is going to be higher than the median tax cut,"" said Patrick Newton, a spokesman for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Tax experts said it’s not clear that Heritage could have computed a true median with the data available. But other groups have come up with other ways to weed out the impact of very large tax savings when producing a measurement of a typical tax cut. The Tax Policy Center is one of them. As we noted, the Tax Policy Center found that the average tax cut for the middle 20 percent of the population was $780. That’s a fraction of the analogous figure in the Heritage study, $1,400. Another group that made a similar assessment, the liberal-leaning Institute for Taxation and Economic Policy, found a figure in line with the Tax Policy Center -- $800 for the middle 20 percent. ""Certainly only looking at the average tax change is not reflective of what the ‘median’ taxpayer will experience,"" said Joe Rosenberg, a senior research associate at the Tax Policy Center. Adam Michel, Heritage’s tax policy analyst, told PolitiFact that they did not calculate a median, but added that ""we are not unique in using averages,"" citing both Congress’ Joint Committee on Taxation and the Tax Policy Center. ""That said, every statistic, both median and mean, gives you different information,"" Michel said. He added that an alternative approach -- looking at the tax cut as a percentage of income in every congressional district, rich and poor -- shows that lower-income districts actually saw tax cuts account for a larger percentage of income than higher-income districts did. A final note: McCarthy’s use of the $44,697 figure is a bit overheated, as well. It refers to a 10-year cumulative figure, using assumptions that the tax cut boosts economic growth. So that figure is neither for a single year, nor is it guaranteed to pan out. McCarthy’s office did not respond to inquiries. McCarthy said, ""Trump tax cut benefits all congressional districts, up to $44,697 per family."" The benefits McCarthy is talking about are added up over 10 years, something that is readily apparent. The number does come from a real study -- and McCarthy is careful to hedge by saying ""up to"" -- but he glosses over significant nuance. The actual one-year, per-household tax cut in the study he cited is $1,400, and even that is exaggerated because the study uses averages, which give greater weight to big tax cuts at the top of the income scale than a median would have. Estimates by other organizations suggest a middle-income household would save between $780 and $800 per year.

Did Sen. Joe Donnelly profit from his family's outsourcing to Mexico?
","A super PAC with ties to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is attacking incumbent Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly in a new ad, referring to the vulnerable Democrat as ""Mexico Joe."" The Senate Leadership Fund ad accuses Donnelly of padding his congressional salary with money from a family company. Donnelly’s ""family got caught outsourcing jobs to Mexico, and ‘Mexico Joe’ profited up to $80,000."" The ad concludes, ""Outsourcing jobs to Mexico. American jobs at risk. Joe Donnelly profits."" We decided to investigate the ad’s statement about Donnelly earning $80,000 from his family after they were ""caught outsourcing."" Donnelly is running for re-election in 2018 against Republican businessman Mike Braun. Republicans see Donnelly’s seat as a potential pickup given that Indiana voted for President Donald Trump in 2016. The company at the center of the ad is Stewart Superior Corporation, which sells scrapbooking and paper crafting supplies, such as stamps and ink pads, and is owned by Donnelly’s brother, Jack. Stewart Superior is based in California, with an office in England and a manufacturing plant in Indiana. In 2011, the company opened an additional manufacturing plant in Mexico, according to import records from trade date company Panjiva. Jack Donnelly’s company operated without much noteriety from 2011 to 2017. Meanwhile, his brother Sen. Joe Donnelly often spoke publicly about stopping the practice of outsourcing jobs. He even proposed the End Outsourcing Act in January 2017. If passed, the measure would require businesses to publicly announce if layoffs were due to outsourcing and to offer tax incentives to businesses who maintain U.S. production. Things came to a head in July 2017, when the Associated Press reported that Donnelly, vocal critic of outsourcing, owned stock in his brother’s company, which operated a manufacturing plant in Mexico. Critics have used his involvement with Stewart Superior, which is capitalizing on the labor practices that Donnelly criticized, as proof of his hypocrisy. Donnelly has not been listed as an officer of the company in Indiana business entity reports since 2005. According to a 2006 interview with the South Bend Tribune, Donnelly has not had an active role in the company since 1997. He had previously served as a corporate officer and general counsel for Stewart Superior, and started his own small business, Marking Solutions, Inc. A month after the AP report, Donnelly sold his stock for $17,410, according to a report by the Indianapolis Business Journal. Will Baskin-Gerwitz, a spokesman for the Donnelly Senate campaign, said Donnelly did not know the company had opened a factory in Mexico until the AP reported it in July. In a July 2017 radio interview, published after the AP story, Donnelly claimed that his brother had ""never outsourced a single job"" — meaning Stewart Superior did not lay off workers in the United States to replace them with cheaper labor in Mexico. The Senate Leadership Fund told us that Stewart Superior outsourced jobs whether or not it laid off workers in the United States. When an American company has layoffs of at least 500 employees or at least 33 percent of the workforce, the employer must issue a notice under the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act. These notifications are filed with the state. In both California and Indiana, the two states where Stewart Superior has American employees, there are no WARN notices on record. Workers who lose their job to outsourcing are also eligible to petition to receive Trade Adjustment Assistance Program benefits. No one from Stewart Superior has petitioned since 1998, when a single case was rejected. What does that suggest? If Stewart Superior did lay off employees when it opened its manufacturing plant in Mexico, the layoffs affected fewer than 33 percent of jobs and none of the workers applied for government assistance. However, it is still possible that some number of workers were laid off. Stewart Superior would not respond to questions. Bottom line: Stewart Superior certainly hired workers in Mexico, but it’s unclear if it was part of an expansion or at the expense of workers in the United States. And if so, how many.   The second part of the Senate Leadership Fund claim is that Donnelly Mexico profited up to $80,000 on outsourcing jobs to Mexico. The reality is the Senate Leadership Fund is referring to money Donnelly made in stock dividends he owned in his brother’s company. Between 2011 and 2017, Donnelly submitted yearly financial disclosure reports. These show his earnings from dividends, which are annual cuts of a company’s profits given to certain shareholders. In 2014 and 2015, Donnelly reported earning between $5,000 and $15,000 in dividends from his stock in Stewart Superior. In 2016, he reported earning between $15,000 and $50,000. Donnelly had also owned stock prior to 2013, but it had been valued below reporting thresholds. The Senate Leadership Fund reaches $80,000 by taking the maximum figure in the range each year: $15,000 in 2014 and 2015, and $50,000 in 2016. If he had been earning the minimum value in the range, he would have made $25,000. To make $80,000, Donnelly’s earnings would have had to jump from $15,000 in 2015 to $50,000 in 2016. Experts say that is improbable based on the $17,400 the Indianapolis Business Journal reported he sold his stock for. According to Louisiana State University finance professor Don Chance, annual dividends are generally only worth a small percentage of the stock. Publicly traded companies will give stockholders an annual dividend worth between 0.5 percent to 4 percent of their stock. Stocks in Home Depot worth $17,000, for instance, would earn just $347 per year in dividends. So, how is it possible that Donnelly’s stock in Stewart Superior, which was worth $17,000 when he sold it, made somewhere between $25,000 and $80,000 over three years? The stock’s value may have fluctuated over time, but we know that it was worth no more than $50,000, based on Donnelly’s financial disclosures. Because Stewart Superior is not a publicly traded company, very little information is available about its investors or financial status. If his stocks were truly worth $17,000 and Donnelly earned only $25,000 from them, he would have received a dividend return of nearly 50 percent. Even if his stocks were valued at the highest possible amount within the range, $50,000, his return rate would have been about 16 percent, which is incredibly high. ""The $25,000 number is ridiculously out of line,"" Chance said. ""And the $80,000 even more so."" Donnelly’s campaign was uncertain why the return rate for his dividends was so high. The Senate Leadership Fund said Joe Donnelly's ""family got caught outsourcing jobs to Mexico, and ‘Mexico Joe’ profited up to $80,000."" The ad also says ""American jobs at risk."" A company owned by Donnelly’s brother, Stewart Superior, opened a manufacturing plant in Mexico in 2011. It is not clear if U.S. jobs were lost as a result. Donnelly's connection to the company in 2011 appears to be that he held stock. As far as Donnelly's profits, the Senate Leadership Fund is highlighting only the high-end of the range he reported as earning in stock dividends. It would be accurate to say he earned between $25,000 and $80,000 by holding stock in his brother's company. This claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False. UPDATE (July 26): After we published this fact-check, the Senate Leadership Fund said it believed Stewart Superior outsourced jobs whether or not U.S. workers were laid off. We have updated the story to better reflect their position. Notwithstanding how you define outsourcing in the context of the ad, or what it means when the ad says ""American jobs at risk,"" the claim by the Senate Leadership Fund overplays Donnelly's connection to Stewart Superior and cherrypicks the high-end estimate of what Donnelly earned from his stock in the company. Our rating remains Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jul/26/senate-leadership-fund/did-donnelly-profit-his-familys-outsourcing/

Jeff Greene targets Florida costs for Trump's golf travel in TV ad
","Jeff Greene, a Democrat billionaire running for Florida governor, has some close connections to President Donald Trump: He is a member of Trump’s Mar-A-Lago club, and they are neighbors in Palm Beach. But that hasn’t stopped Greene from criticizing Trump for receiving taxpayer-funded protection during his South Florida visits: ""Every time Trump comes here to play golf, Florida taxpayers are paying for it. Millions wasted in road closures and overtime. Jeff Greene will put a stop to that day one,"" said Greene’s TV ad promoting his Democratic primary bid for governor. Here’s where Greene has a point: The Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office has spent millions on security for Trump’s visits. Here’s what Greene left out: The federal government has already reimbursed local law enforcement agencies for protecting Trump. And while the next governor could send a bill to the federal government, it would likely end up in the shredder. Greene’s spokeswoman pointed to a Palm Beach Post article that found local law enforcement agencies fronted more than $5.7 million to help protect Trump between November 2017 and April 2018. Most of that money was spent by the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office, while smaller amounts were spent by West Palm Beach and Palm Beach police departments. However, the federal government has already established a process for reimbursement. The Presidential Residence Protection Assistance Grant provided $41 million to reimburse state and local law enforcement agencies for costs incurred between Jan. 21, 2017, and Sept. 30, 2017, while protecting Trump’s residences in Florida, New York and New Jersey. The Federal Emergency Management Agency administers these funds. In 2017, the largest grant recipient was the New York City Police Department, which helps guard Trump Tower. The department received about $36 million. In Palm Beach County, the sheriff’s office received $3.3 million, the full amount it sought for reimbursement, according to Therese Barbera, a sheriff spokeswoman. The town of Palm Beach received $71,000 and West Palm Beach received $63,000. In a neighboring county, the Broward Sheriff’s Office also received money. Local law enforcement agencies can submit their next requests for federal reimbursement in October.   While Greene cited Trump’s visits to play golf, Trump doesn’t only play golf while in Palm Beach County. Trump has conducted some business while in South Florida, including hosting Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe at Mar-A-Lago. But he is clearly a fan of golf. PolitiFact’s Trump Golf Tracker showed that as of May 18, 2018, he had at least 56 confirmed golf outings, including some in Florida. (Our tabulation could be an undercount since it is based on confirmed golf outings. The New York Times has tracked how many times Trump has visited his properties, including golf courses, which adds up to 170 as of mid-July.) Greene said he would put a stop to this. We can't fact-check whether he will, because that's a prediction. But we can analyze whether the governor has control. Campaign spokeswoman Claire VanSusteren pointed to a line in Article 7 Section 1 in the Florida Constitution that states, ""No money shall be drawn from the treasury except in pursuance of appropriation made by law."" We sent Greene’s constitutional argument to a few Florida legal experts: Nova Southeastern University law professor Robert Jarvis; Talbot ""Sandy"" D’Alemberte, a former president of the American Bar Association and former president of Florida State University; and Raoul Cantero, a former Florida Supreme Court judge and a partner at White and Case law firm. The experts would essentially say to Greene: Good luck with that. This portion of the Florida Constitution is about taxation — the state budget says nothing about relations with the federal government. There is nothing in that section that would compel the federal government to comply with such a request from a governor. Jarvis said that a state governor has no power over a president.   ""This is because of a legal doctrine known as the ‘superior sovereign doctrine.’ Under it, a lower government official cannot order a higher government official to do anything,"" he said. ""This stems from medieval times, when a king could order a prince to do things, but a prince could not order a king to do anything. In our country, this means that the states are subservient to the federal government."" Greene said, ""Every time Trump comes here to play golf, Florida taxpayers are paying for it. Millions wasted in road closures and overtime. Jeff Greene will put a stop to that day 1."" Local law enforcement in Palm Beach County have spent millions on security when Trump visits, but they have submitted their costs for reimbursement, and will continue to do so. Greene cites a portion of the Florida Constitution about taxation that he says he would use to submit a bill to the federal government. He could certainly try that, but the legal experts we talked to said that’s not the purpose of that part of the Constitution. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jul/26/jeff-greene/could-florida-governor-bill-feds-police-trumps-gol/

Evers' boast of being first to lead Walker in poll falls short of finish line
","Is a blue wave going to hit Wisconsin come November? It’s a question that has been heavily debated since the election of President Donald Trump in 2016 -- and the wave of Democratic candidates who have won elections across the country in the months since. Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who was first elected in 2010, has warned about complacency and the prospect of Democrats winning the office in the fall. The race as of July is a still-dense field of Democratic candidates challenging Walker, who withstood challenges by Democrats Tom Barrett in 2012 and Mary Burke in 2014. State Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers has been leading the field of Democrats in the polls, and in a June 27, 2018, campaign email made a claim we want to check: ""I’m the first Democrat to ever lead Scott Walker in an election year."" Is he right? The Evers poll When asked for backup, Evers’ campaign team did not point to any independent polling that confirmed a lead over Walker. Instead, they pointed to an Evers-financed poll that was conducted from May 9 to 10, 2018, by the privately-owned, Democratic polling firm Public Policy Polling. Those who participated in the automated telephone interviews were not informed of who paid for the poll, and Evers’ campaign had nothing to do with the poll other than paying for it, said Jim Williams, an analyst with the firm. Respondents were asked: ""If the election for Governor were held today and the candidates were Democratic Wisconsin Superintendent of Public Schools Tony Evers, and Republican Governor Scott Walker, who would you vote for?"" The result: Evers received 49 percent, while Walker had 45 percent, with 6 percent undecided. According to a news release regarding the poll, the firm questioned 644 registered voters in Wisconsin. The poll had a margin of error of nearly 3.9 percent -- or, roughly the same amount Evers led by. Other polling in the 2018 race Of course, many campaigns do their own polling -- though they typically only release results that offer the most positive spin. Meanwhile, the Marquette University Law School poll has done a set of head-to-head matchups between Walker and Evers (and Walker vs. other candidates) in June. The poll showed the opposite of what Evers’ poll found: As of June, Walker led by a margin of 4 percent: 48 percent favored Walker and 44 percent favored Evers. Walker also led the rest of his potential opponents in head-to-head matchups. In the most recent poll, released July 18, 2018, voters were not asked about direct matchups with Walker, but Evers led fellow Democratic contenders, with 31 percent of voters choosing Evers. Still, about 38% said they did not know who they plan to vote for in the August primary, and it is not yet clear that he’d bode well against Walker if he does proceed to the November election. In the July poll, Walker’s approval rating was 47 percent, with 45 percent disapproving. So, the internal poll cited by Evers is at odds with the main public poll released during this cycle. But, the main question is whether his claim holds up when looking at past Walker runs. Polls in past gubernatorial races When asked to support his claim, the Evers’ campaign referred to past Marquette Law School polls during Burke’s run against Walker in 2014 and Barrett’s run in 2012, as well as a New York Times compilation of independent pollsters regarding the 2010 election between Walker and Barrett. (The Marquette poll did not exist in 2010.) At the same time, the campaign sought to refine the original statement. ""There is no other proof of a Democratic candidate beating Scott Walker by four points in an election year,"" Maggie Gau, Evers’ campaign manager, said in an email. Now, it may be true that no candidate was leading Walker by exactly four points. But there is evidence of other candidates pulling ahead in some polls -- though not many. Let’s look at the elections. 2010: In a Marist poll that involved 811 registered voters in October 2010, Barrett led Walker by 3 points, 44 percent to 41 percent. The poll was performed by the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion, a survey research center in Poughkeepsie, N.Y. That is the only instance Barrett pulled ahead of Walker during that election season. 2012: In a February 2012 Public Policy Polling poll of 900 registered voters, Barrett led Walker 49 percent to 46 percent. Another Democratic candidate in the race at the time, Kathleen Falk, also led Walker in the poll, 48 percent to 47 percent. Unlike the PPP survey Evers referenced in his claim, this poll was not paid for by any candidate in the race. Also like the Evers PPP poll, those results are within the margin of error of +/- 3.27 percent. A May 2012 Marquette poll also showed that among registered voters Barrett led Walker 47percent to 46 percent. However, the one-point advantage was the opposite among likely voters, who preferred Walker 48 to 47 percent. 2014: Polls showed the race between Burke and Walker as a tight one. According to a Marquette poll from August 2014, Walker led among registered voters 47.5 percent to 44.1 percent, but Burke led among likely voters 48.6 percent to 46.5 percent. Another survey, by Rasmussen Reports in October of that year, found Burke led Walker 49 percent to 48 percent. The survey pool included 973 likely voters.
  Our rating In a campaign email, Evers said ""I’m the first Democrat to ever lead Scott Walker in an election year."" He cited a single internal poll -- one at odds with public polling in the race. But there were two instances in which Burke led Walker -- however slightly -- in 2014, and one poll in which Barrett led Walker in 2010. We rate Evers’ claim False. (Editor's note: On July 26, 2018, after this item was published, an NBC-Marist College poll was released that showed Evers leading Walker 54 percent to 41 percent.

Is housing unaffordable for full-time minimum-wage workers in 99 percent of counties in America?
","Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., has recently made it a point to support affordable housing, both in her social media posts and in the legislation she brings before Congress. On July 19, Harris introduced the Rent Relief Act to Congress, which would provide assistance in the form of a refundable tax credit to those who make under $100,000 a year and spend more than 30 percent of their income on housing. To rally support for the bill, she tweeted, ""In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can’t afford a 1-bedroom apartment."" She later posted a video that expressed a similar sentiment and repeated the statistic.    In 99% of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can’t afford a 1-bedroom apartment. That is outrageous. I've just introduced the Rent Relief Act, so that Americans who spend over 30% of their income on rent can get a portion of that money back. We decided to look into Harris’s statement. Aside from a few minor caveats, the statement is largely accurate. Out of reach? We began by reaching out to Harris’s press secretary, who directed us to a 2017 study published by the National Low Income Housing Coalition titled ""Out of Reach."" The study is updated yearly, and the 2018 edition is out. Harris’s press secretary pointed out a line from the latest study that reads, ""In only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent."" That statistic and the coalition’s report overall have been cited by various news outlets. Do the math, and you’ll see that 22 divided by 3,000 comes out to a figure slightly smaller than 1 percent. That small percentage refers to the counties where a one-bedroom home is affordable for minimum-wage workers. But there are two concepts in the sentence from the study that require further clarification: affordability and ""fair market rent."" The national coalition defines ""affordability"" as ""consistent with the federal standard that no more than 30 percent of a household’s gross income should be spent on rent and utilities."" That’s the same guideline used by the Department of Housing and Urban Development, and we found it’s a standard threshold within the field. The definition of ""fair market rent"" is slightly different. It also has its origins from HUD. The National Low Income Housing Coalition defines it as ""typically the 40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units."" So that means that within any given metropolitan area, 40 percent of all rental properties are priced equal to or below the fair market rent threshold. That means not all units within the 99 percent of counties referred to in Harris’s tweet are unaffordable for full-time minimum-wage workers, but it does mean that a majority — 60 percent — are. Of the remaining 40 percent of one-bedroom housing, some units may be affordable for those workers, but that doesn’t mean they’ll be quality apartments — they might be in a high-crime area or low-performing school district, for example. (We previously cleared up the definition of ""fair market rent"" in a fact-check of a Facebook graphic.) As Vincent Reina, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, put it, ""It does not mean there are 0 affordable units (in the 99% of counties that Harris is referring to), it means that there are none affordable at or above the 40th percentile of the rent distribution. There are likely some units that are affordable, just not even close to enough.""   The experts we reached out to pointed out that the conclusions reached by the National Low Income Housing Coalition are supported by other research, including a recent study published by the Joint Center of Housing Studies of Harvard University. ""Not all the studies would support the exact claim that 99 percent of counties in the U.S. are unaffordable, but there’s a lot of evidence that the poorest families (say the bottom 20-25 percent) are financially stretched to afford unsubsidized housing,"" said Jenny Schuetz, a David M. Rubenstein Fellow in the Metropolitan Policy Program at the Brookings Institution. Our ruling Harris recently tweeted, ""In 99 percent of counties in America, someone making the minimum wage working full time can’t afford a 1-bedroom apartment."" She was referring to a recent study by the National Low Income Housing Coalition, which shows that ""in only 22 counties out of more than 3,000 counties nationwide can a full-time minimum wage worker afford a one-bedroom rental home at fair market rent."" Harris didn’t refer to the concept of ""fair market rent,"" which is defined as the ""40th percentile of gross rents for standard rental units."" The underlying study she referenced doesn’t say that a minimum wage worker can’t afford any housing in almost all of the United States, but that a minimum wage worker can’t afford the average-priced housing unit. With that said, Harris’s claim is still a largely accurate characterization of the magnitude of the rent affordability problems that many people face. We rate this claim Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2018/jul/25/kamala-harris/housing-unaffordable-full-time-minimum-wage-worker/

Brett Kavanaugh ruled Consumer Financial Protection Bureau structurally unconstitutional
","Democrats are using a court decision on their hard-fought financial industry watchdog to raise red flags about President Donald Trump’s Supreme Court pick. U.S. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., said Brett Kavanaugh wrote an opinion opposing the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. ""Serious concerns I have about Judge Kavanaugh in addition to the obvious health care & separation of power issues: He ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court) & went out of his way to dissent against net neutrality,"" Klobuchar tweeted on July 9. Serious concerns I have about Judge Kavanaugh in addition to the obvious health care & separation of power issues: He ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court) & went out of his way to dissent against net neutrality Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., made the same claim in a tweet. We wondered whether Kavanaugh had indeed ruled the CFPB was unconstitutional. Largely, yes. The bureau has stirred controversy from the start. Warren was an early advocate for the CFPB and was considered the likely first head until a potential appointment was opposed by Republicans in Congress. Obama’s second choice, Richard Cordray, was also kept from taking office, until Obama sidestepped GOP lawmakers by making a recess appointment. Cordray was later confirmed with some bipartisan support in 2013. (Cordray is now running for governor in Ohio.) Unlike most federal agencies, the bureau does not rely on appropriations for its funding. The bureau’s operating budget comes from the Federal Reserve and does not require congressional approval. The CFPB is headed by a single director with a five-year term who cannot be fired at will. The president may only remove the director for ""inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office,"" according to the law that established it. After CFPB imposed a $109 million fine on PHH Corp., the New Jersey mortgage service provider sued, challenging the constitutionality of the CFPB. In 2016, the D.C. Court of Appeals sided with the company and cleared the fine. Kavanaugh, one of the three judges, wrote the opinion. Kavanaugh wrote that the CFPB is ""unconstitutionally structured."" The structure, Kavanaugh argued, gives the CFPB director more unilateral authority than anyone in the government besides the president. In order to remedy the constitutional flaw, Kavanaugh wrote, Supreme Court precedent dictates a ""narrower remedy"" than shutting down the entire CFPB. Kavanaugh suggested allowing the president to supervise, direct and fire the director at will. That’s not exactly the same thing as finding the CFPB itself to be unconstitutional, but it’s close, law experts told us. A later decision by the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit upheld CFPB’s constitutionality. The question could still come to the Supreme Court. Aaron Klein, the policy director at Brookings Institution’s Center on Regulations and Markets, said that tying CFPB directly to the president, and thus election cycles, could curb its intended independence. ""Reducing the independence of any financial regulator is likely to make them pursue less politically unpopular activities, like reining in credit practices during good times,""  he said. ""That’s why financial regulation tends to only pass Congress after crises, and as the memory of the crisis fades, deregulation comes in."" Klobuchar said Kavanaugh ""ruled that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau was unconstitutional (reversed by full Circuit Court)."" In 2016, Kavanaugh wrote the opinion for a three judge panel of the D.C. Circuit finding the CFPB structurally unconstitutional. The issue lay in the bureau’s leadership structure, not the bureau itself. That said, a change to its leadership structure could rein in the regulatory activities CFPB performs.

Stewart off the mark in repeated attacks on Kaine's support for military
","During a recent debate, Republican Corey Stewart criticized incumbent Sen. Tim Kaine for his frequent opposition to President Donald Trump. As evidence, Stewart said Kaine voted against Trump’s proposal for a bolstered military budget. ""He has the nerve to say that he supports our military,"" Stewart said. ""President Trump proposed the increase to $700 billion to our military budget, which included the 355-ship navy, which included a military pay increase, a modest one, which included, an yet even more modest housing allowance, but yet he even voted against giving more money to our men and women who are in the military service and against our housing allowance."" Stewart repeated similar versions of the same claim five more times during the debate. ""Earlier this year President Trump and the Republicans have proposed legislation for a 355-ship Navy, they proposed legislation that would've included another $7.1 billion of veterans care, they proposed legislation that would have increased the salaries for our military personnel, and increased the housing allowance,"" Stewart said later. ""He voted against all of it."" Ian Sams, communications director for the Kaine campaign, said Stewart has been repeating the accusation for months. ""I support the military with my own flesh and blood,"" Kaine, who serves on the Senate Armed Services Committee, responded. ""My boy is an infantry commander in the Marine Corps."" Kaine added that ""the record will show"" Stewart’s claims to be made-up. We decided to check the record for ourselves. When contacted for comment, Stewart campaign spokesman Noel Fritsch said Kaine voted against a short-term government spending bill on Jan. 19, 2018. ""This spending bill included all of the items Corey mentioned,"" Fritsch wrote in an email. Kaine did vote against that bill, a continuing resolution that would have kept the government funded through Feb. 16, 2018. Ultimately, the measure fell 10 votes short of passing and resulted in a government shutdown through Jan. 22. Before voting, Kaine issued a joint statement with fellow Virginia Sen. Mark Warner detailing his opposition to a bill that would mean ""punt(ing) budget discussions until mid-February."" ""Congress should remain in session with no recess until we work out a long-term bipartisan budget deal that addresses all issues,"" Kaine and Warner said. In a second statement after the vote, Kaine and Warner explained that Virginians wanted ""a bill that funds our military, education and health care programs, extends the Children’s Health Insurance Program, and protects Dreamers."" Despite opposing the short-term resolution, Kaine was one of 65 Senators who voted in favor of the omnibus spending bill — a bill packaging many smaller appropriations bills into one — that Congress approved on March 23 to fund the remainder of the fiscal year through Sept. 30. Although Fritsch pointed us to the Jan. 19 vote, Stewart told local news outlets after the debate that he was referring to the March 23 omnibus spending bill in his attack on Kaine. That bill, a 2,232-page document formally titled the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, authorized $1.3 billion in spending. Trump signed it into effect the same day Congress approved it, despite a last-minute veto threat on Twitter. In response to Trump’s Twitter post, Kaine blasted the president for displaying ""the Art of the Deal-Wrecker."" After Trump signed the bill, Kaine applauded the legislation as a ""long list of wins for Virginia."" ""It will help rebuild our crumbling infrastructure, spur economic growth, combat the opioid epidemic, support shipbuilding and ship repair, boost defense funding, allow us to continue to protect the Chesapeake Bay, deliver affordable child care, increase accessibility to cyber scholarships, expand access to higher education, and more,"" Kaine said in a statement. Among its many provisions, the omnibus spending bill allocated $700 billion for military spending, boosted military hardware, added funding for veterans care, authorized an expansion of the Navy’s fleet, raised pay for military personnel by 2.4 percent and increased funding for military housing. Ironically, Sams, the Kaine campaign’s communications director, noted that Stewart himself said he would have preferred to see the bill vetoed. ""I wish the president had vetoed it,"" Stewart said March 26, 2018, during a radio interview on the John Fredericks Show. ""I don't know what his calculation was … they gave him a bad bill, one in which he didn’t feel that he had any choice but to sign it."" Stewart called the bill ""an absolute nightmare and a disaster"" due to its high spending totals, lack of funding for the border wall, and provisions covering Obamacare, sanctuary cities, gun control and ""a sweetheart project that (Senate Minority Leader Chuck) Schumer has going up in his district."" Sams said Kaine has advocated for proposals to improve the military since Trump took office, including the Navy’s plans to boost its ship count from 280 to 355 over the next few decades. Kaine was an original co-sponsor for a 2017 act declaring that ""it shall be the policy of the United States to have available, as soon as practicable, at least 355 battle force ships."" In May, for example, Kaine said he hoped Congress would ""maintain forward motion towards a 355-ship Navy."" A month prior, Kaine said the Navy’s potential expansion to 355 ships could benefit workers. ""We talk about what 355 means for the budget, and there are a whole series of issues there, but there is a real work force need,"" Kaine said at a meeting of the Senate Armed Services sea power panel. ""Folks who are going to be building these ships are in pre-K right now."" Kaine’s campaign also pointed to several instances where Kaine showed support for the military, including when he defended increased military spending, applauded the Navy’s purchase of aircraft carriers and sponsored an amendment providing $12.3 billion for Virginia shipbuilding. Stewart said, ""President Trump proposed the increase to $700 billion to our military budget, which included the 355-ship Navy, which included a military pay increase, a modest one, which included, a yet even more modest housing allowance, but yet (Kaine) even voted against giving more money to our men and women who are in the military service and against our housing allowance."" Kaine did vote no on a short-term government spending bill, which included several of the military-related provisions Stewart cited, in order to signal his disapproval for another short-term budget resolution. However, Kaine eventually voted in favor of those same provisions when he said yes to the omnibus spending bill on March 23, and he has taken other actions and made other statements in support of those provisions. We rate Stewart’s statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2018/jul/25/corey-stewart/stewart-mark-repeated-attacks-kaines-support-milit/

Is Beto O'Rourke the only Senate candidate to call for Donald Trump's impeachment?
","There’s no sign of Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas favoring the impeachment of President Donald Trump. Now Cruz says his Democratic challenger, U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke of El Paso, stands alone nationally for tilting the other way. Cruz’s campaign said in a July 17, 2018, press release that O’Rourke ""continued today his reckless and radical Senate campaign based on impeaching Pres. Donald Trump. He is the only candidate to the U.S. Senate to call for impeachment,"" the release said. We wondered: Is O’Rourke alone among Senate hopefuls in advocating the Republican president’s impeachment? Not so, we found, though it looks like he's the only Senate nominee to date to say he'd vote to launch impeachment proceedings. Refresher: The Constitution gives the House the power to impeach the president, vice president and other civil federal officials for treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors while it gives the Senate the power of trying impeachments. Convictions and consequent removals from office require the concurrence of two-thirds’ of senators in attendance. In recent history, President Bill Clinton was impeached; he wasn’t convicted or removed. O’Rourke has repeatedly said he’d vote to impeach Our search of the Nexis news database showed that as early as August 2017, O’Rourke said he’d vote for Trump’s impeachment. Most recently, the Dallas Morning News quoted O’Rourke saying in July 2018 that Trump merited impeachment for his performance in the just-completed summit with Russia’s leader, Vladimir Putin. O’Rourke responded to a News reporter: ""Standing on stage in another country with the leader of another country who wants to and has sought to undermine this country, and to side with him over the United States — if I were asked to vote on this I would vote to impeach the president. Impeachment, much like an indictment, shows that there is enough there for the case to proceed and at this point there is certainly enough there for the case to proceed."" Then again, O’Rourke in December 2017 was among 364 House members to vote for tabling a proposal by Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, to impeach Trump, records show. Before that vote, Democratic leaders released a statement referring to Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s inquiry that said impeachment wasn’t timely. When we asked Cruz’s campaign how the senator determined that O’Rourke was alone among Senate candidates calling for impeachment, spokeswoman Catherine Frazier pointed out by email that the News story noting O’Rourke’s willingness to vote for impeachment quoted Cruz’s campaign manager, Jeff Roe, leveling a more limited claim. Roe called O’Rourke ""the only major-party candidate in America to call for impeachment."" Another Cruz contact, Emily Miller, emailed us a web link to a November 2017 Reuters news story describing O’Rourke saying that Trump’s racially charged rhetoric and divisive governing style had led O’Rourke to support impeachment. O’Rourke was quoted saying: ""I’m now convinced beyond the shadow of a doubt that Donald Trump is unfit for that office."" O’Rourke spokesman says he’s not ‘called’ for impeaching Trump When we reached out to O’Rourke about Cruz calling him the only Senate candidate to call for impeachment, campaign spokesman Chris Evans said by email: ""Beto has never called for the impeachment of President Trump."" Evans maintained that O’Rourke’s responses to reporters and voters about voting in favor of impeachment weren’t the same as the candidate calling for impeachment. Evans elaborated that O’Rourke hasn’t brought up impeachment ""at town halls or rallies, has not sent fundraising or petition emails on it, has not posted social media advocating for it, and has not used his current position of public trust to do so through floor speeches, letters or resolutions."" Evans also pointed out an interview we’d missed. For an episode of Showtime’s ""The Circus,"" posted online in May 2018, O’Rourke replied that as a member of the House, he’d vote right then to impeach Trump. Asked if he’d vote as a senator to convict Trump, O’Rourke replied: ""Until I'm in that position and am able to hear the case made by each side, all the facts laid out, I can't give you an answer on that--nor would you want me to."" Other Senate candidates? Our search for other Senate candidates favoring impeachment turned up a couple. Responding to our inquiries, nonpartisan observers said by email that while O’Rourke appeared to be the only Democratic Senate nominee to speak out for Trump’s impeachment, he was likely not the only Senate candidate to do so. Jennifer Duffy, who analyzes Senate races for the Cook Political Report, pointed out a May 2018 TIME news story quoting Richard Painter, a longshot Democratic challenger to Minnesota Sen. Tina Smith, saying he favors Trump’s impeachment. The story said too, though, that Painter’s ""emphasis on impeachment talk sets him apart from most other Democratic candidates."" Duffy called Painter a ""second-tier candidate who is notable for a couple of reasons: he used to be a Republican and he is taking on an appointed incumbent. Generally, the Senate and House Democratic leadership is dissuading their candidates from talking about impeachment because they are afraid such talk will energize Trump voters and entice them to the polls in November. ""O'Rourke is a break-the-mold candidate,"" Duffy wrote, ""so it doesn't surprise me that he is talking about it."" Generally, Duffy commented, the ""challenge here is that literally hundreds of second- and third-tier candidates file to run for the Senate and get very little attention. I suspect that some of the Democrats in these categories have called for Trump's impeachment, but no one is paying attention."" Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia expert who analyzes federal races, described O’Rourke as alone among Democratic candidates in ""somewhat-to-very competitive Senate races"" to call for impeachment. ""However,"" Sabato wrote, ""we do not keep up with uncompetitive Senate states. Sometimes long-shot candidates will take positions that more cautious nominees who have a real chance to win will avoid."" Our Nexis search turned up another candidate backing impeachment. In June 2018, Kevin de León, a Democrat running for the Senate in California, called for Trump to be impeached immediately, the Sacramento Bee reported in a June 21, 2018, news story. De León, who faces incumbent Democrat Dianne Feinstein on the November ballot, was quoted saying: ""What this president has done easily surpasses what Richard Nixon did back in Watergate. ... What I've seen to date easily, in my mind, qualifies for impeachment."" Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke is ""the only candidate to the U.S. Senate to call for"" impeaching Trump. Since August 2017, O’Rourke has been saying that he’d vote to impeach Trump, which would start with a vote in the House, where he serves. O’Rourke might be the only Senate nominee to say as much. However, Democratic Senate contenders in Minnesota and California also have talked up Trump's impeachment. We rate this claim about O'Rourke's uniqueness False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

No, ABC News did not recently ban American flag pins on TV
","A misleading claim that circulated online after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks has been retrofitted for the Trump era. The claim is that ABC News recently banned reporters from wearing American flag lapel pins on air in response to the current political climate. ""Yesterday the brass at ABC News issued orders forbidding reporters to wear lapel pin American flags or other patriotic insignia,"" reads an article on a website called Politifeed. ""Their reasoning was that ABC should remain neutral about ‘causes.’ "" This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found no credible evidence to back up the headline. Here’s a sliver of accuracy contained in the article: ABC News has had a longstanding policy that forbids reporters from wearing any lapel pins, according to top executives. However, virtually everything else about the claim is wrong. The policy applies to ""any lapel pins of any sort,"" not just American flags, former ABC News president David Westin told CNN. The policy was also in place prior to the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, according to Westin’s description of the policy (hat tip to our friends at Snopes for flagging the 2012 interview): ""We’d long had a policy at ABC News that we wouldn’t let people wear any lapel pins of any sort,"" Westin said. ""The theory being that when you’re reporting the news, you should be reporting the news, not taking a position. I said quickly (after the 9/11 attacks), ‘We’re going to stick with our policy and stand by that.’ I believe to this day that was the right decision."" According to a Snopes fact-check from October 2001, ABC News was singled out because a nationally syndicated article suggested the network’s policy made it an outlier among news networks at a time of heightened patriotism.   Thus spawned the false claim about ABC News enacting a new policy banning lapel pins in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks that claimed the lives of nearly 3,000 people. Now the claim has been updated to make it appear the ABC News’ ""ban"" (in truth, a longstanding policy) is a response to Donald Trump’s presidency.  The political conditions may have changed since the claim was first born, but it is still untrue. As an aside, we’d note that the older claim that President Barack Obama sought to ban American flag pins is an extreme distortion of reality.

Blog twists Obama statement about being first president from Kenya
","A website revived suspicion of Barack Obama’s birthplace by using a quote from the former president’s recent visit to Kenya out of context. The headline published on Supremeinsider.com says, ""Barack Obama: I’m ‘the First Sitting American President to Come From Kenya’ (Video)."" Barack Obama was born in Honolulu, Hawaii, on August 4, 1961, to Barack Obama Sr., who is Kenyan, and Ann Dunham, of Kansas. The story comes with a one-minute video from Obama’s visit in Kenya in mid July 2018. Obama was in the country for the launch of a sports and training center founded by his sister, Auma Obama, through her Sauti Kuu Foundation. The next stop on his African trip was South Africa where he delivered the annual Mandela Lecture in Johannesburg. The clip from the grand opening of the center in Kogelo shows him saying, ""Three years ago, I visited Kenya as the first sitting American president to come from Kenya."" He’s talking about a July 2015 trip to Kenya and Ethiopia for the annual Global Entrepreneurship Summit. Obama did use those words (check the 5:50-minute mark of this video). But it doesn’t support the impression the article gives, which is that birther claims should be re-investigated because Obama admitted he ""comes from Kenya."" The article frames his comment as a ""slip."" The article goes on to cite an Economist/YouGov.com poll — from Decembrer 2016 — that found one-third of Americans don’t believe Obama was born in Hawaii. Of the 1,345 people polled about the statement ""President Obama was born in Kenya,"" 12 percent responded Definitely True and 24 percent responded Probably True. The article uses this doubt coupled with Obama’s admission in his speech to suggest that there’s some truth to claims that he was born in Kenya. The article later calls for an investigation into the matter to find out if Obama was ever eligible to be president. ""I still want it investigated if he was even born here and eligible to be President! He could be thrown in jail and all he owns confiscated and sold!!"" Alex Hall wrote. We wanted to look into the claim and see if Obama really said he was the first sitting president to come from Kenya. It turns out he did. Obama released a birth certificate back in 2011 when he was pressured by Donald Trump and the birther movement. The article also includes a tweet from Obama’s brother Malik Obama that includes a Kenyan birth certificate that’s supposed to document birth details of the former president. We debunked this back in 2009 with a fact-check where a Kenyan official confirms the certificate is phony. The article doesn’t consider that the former president is describing his heritage rather than alluding to his father’s home country being his actual place of birth. (We reached out to Obama’s adviser Eric Schultz for a comment and received no response.) The article takes his statement of being ""from"" somewhere to mean that he literally grew up there. Obama has denied being born outside of the United States on several occasions. Part of our process is to reach out to the author of claims we’re checking. The author of this story, Alex Hall, has authored nine other stories for Supreme Insider but none of them have contact information. A reverse image search of his profile photo revealed that it’s a generic photo of a man wearing a t-shirt that’s found on several other sites across the internet, such as Pinterest. A story on Supremeinsider.com says ""Barack Obama: I’m ‘the First Sitting American President to Come From Kenya’ (Video)."" In the video from his speech in Kenya Obama does say he’s the ""first sitting American president to come from Kenya."" The article, however, goes on to suggest that this comment invalidates any past efforts Obama has made to assure that he was born in the United States and call for an investigation. The message from Obama’s speech was misinterpreted to mean he was born and/or raised in Kenya when he was actually saying that he is of Kenyan heritage. There’s no evidence to prove Obama was not born in the United States. We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jul/25/supremeinsidercom/did-obama-admit-being-born-kenya/

Ocasio-Cortez: In New York City, there are 3 vacant apartments for each homeless person
","New York Democratic congressional candidate Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has put poverty and inequality at the center of her campaign. On Twitter, she focused on troubles in the New York City housing market. New York City is experiencing the highest rate of homelessness since the Great Depression,"" she wrote July 23. ""For every one person experiencing homelessness here, there are about three vacant apartments. Inequality is a crisis, and a bold, 21st-century effort on poverty must advance."" New York City is experiencing the highest rate of homelessness since the Great Depression.For every 1 person experiencing homelessness here, there are ~3 vacant apartments.Inequality is a crisis, and a bold, 21st-century effort on poverty must advance.https://t.co/RLIKS18N4p Ocasio-Cortez’s stat about the number of homeless and the number of vacant apartments caught our eye. There are about 63,000 homeless people in New York City, and the number of vacant housing units is in the range of 150,000 to 180,000. Given the number of families, the actual number of homeless households seeking permanent shelter is about 32,000, and the number of apartments available for rent is closer to 79,000. The numbers lack great precision but in large measure, the 1-to-3 ratio is about right. Campaign spokesman Jeff Latzer told us that ""numbers vary, but there’s roughly 63,495 homeless and 247,977 vacancies."" With those numbers, there are 3.8 empty places for each homeless person. Let’s look at the sources behind both figures. Official reports back up the homeless count. New York City’s Homeless Services Department’s May survey had 62,147 individuals staying in temporary housing. That stat overstates the number of apartments needed, because it includes children in families. The advocacy group Coalition for the Homeless in New York City says the actual number of homeless households, both families and single adults, is closer to 32,000. Turning to vacancies, the city’s 2017 Housing and Vacancy Survey did find 247,977 ""vacant units, not available for sale or rent."" But before we dive into that big number, the survey found another 79,000 vacant apartments that were actually on the rental market. That’s the number Giselle Routhier, the homeless coalition’s policy director, focuses on. Routhier compared it to the number of apartments needed, not the number of homeless people. ""There are about 2.5 vacant rental apartments for every homeless household in New York City,"" Routhier said. ""But the problem is even worse than the point-in-time data. New York City loses thousands of affordable apartment every year through rent increases and deregulation. Between 1996 and 2017, New York City lost more than 1.1 million housing units with contract rents below $800 per month."" Routhier’s way of looking at the city’s costly housing market is very different from Ocasio-Cortez’s, but the final numbers are reasonably close. Routhier said about 2.5 and Ocasio-Cortez said about three. Matthew Gordon Lasner, associate professor of urban studies at Hunter College, warned that the focus on math only takes you so far. ""The comparison she’s making — no matter the ratio or numbers — is really a rhetorical device, to point out that the city has the capacity to house all its residents,"" Lasner said. So now let’s get back to that big number of nearly 248,000 ""vacant units, not available for sale or rent."" It’s not what it might seem. The total includes 58,000 units ""undergoing renovation"" and another 22,000 rented or sold ""but not yet occupied."" All told, about 129,000 units are vacant due to one process or another that takes them out of the active housing market. 2017 Housing and Vacancy Survey Total rental units 2,183,064 Occupied 2,103,874 Vacant, available 79,190 Vacant units, not available for sale or rent 247,977 Held for occasional, seasonal, or recreational use 74,945 Rented, not yet occupied 10,960 Sold, not yet occupied 11,156 Undergoing renovation 58,347 Awaiting renovation 20,283 In legal dispute 9,626 Held pending sale of building 5,886 Owner’s personal problems (age, illness, etc.) 12,719 Held for other reasons 27,009 But that still leaves nearly 75,000 units in the category of ""held for occasional, seasonal, or recreational use."" These are the pied-à-terre of the well-to-do, and sometimes, the super-duper-well-to-do. ""A bit of that is new –  global billionaires parking money in Midtown condos,"" said Lasner. ""But New York’s always had tens of thousands of suburbanites, U.S. out-of-towners, and foreigners keeping apartments. That’s been the case for centuries in all important business and government centers."" Lasner prefers to focus on what he called a practical figure — the number of units that could be on the market ""with a few nudges or tweaks of the law."" For him, between the available and the unavailable vacancies, the baseline is in the range of 150,000 to 180,000. Taking Ocasio-Cortez’s count of homeless people, and estimating 150,000 and 180,000 vacancies, the ratio falls to 1 person for between 2.4 and nearly 3 apartments. If instead we use the number of homeless households, the ratio could get to the neighborhood of 1-to-6 (32,000 households for 180,000 vacancies). Pushing further, comparing homeless households to just the number of vacant apartments truly on the market (79,000 divided by 32,000), the result is 1-to-2.4. Ocasio-Cortez said that ""for every one person experiencing homelessness here, there are about three vacant apartments."" The number of homeless people is about 63,000. The number of vacant apartments is harder to judge, but no matter how we jiggered the numbers, the lowest ratio we found was 1-to-2.4. And the high could get close to 1-to-6. There’s a lot push and pull in the underlying statistics, but in the main, Ocasio-Cortez’s math holds up. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/jul/25/alexandria-ocasio-cortez/ocasio-cortez-new-york-city-there-are-3-vacant-apa/

Jeanine Pirro’s new book falsely declares the Russia investigation over
","In a new book that lauds President Donald Trump and lashes out at his critics, Fox News host Jeanine Pirro declares that Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s probe into Trump campaign ties with Russia is effectively dead. Her evidence? Pirro, a former judge, points to what’s missing from a special counsel indictment in February of more than a dozen Russians: namely, the fact that no charges were filed against Americans. ""The Russia collusion investigation is over,"" Pirro wrote in ""Liars, Leakers and Liberals: The Case Against the Anti-Trump Conspiracy."" ""Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein announced that himself, for all intents and purposes, when he indicted thirteen Russians for interfering in the election and said explicitly that no Americans had been knowingly involved."" So, did the Justice Department’s No. 2 man announce the end of the Mueller probe back in February? Hardly. Pirro’s claim turns on an action Mueller took on Feb. 16, 2018 — or rather, an action he didn’t take. That day, the special counsel charged 13 Russians and three Russian entities with conspiring to defraud the United States and interfere with the 2016 presidential election. No Americans were named in that indictment. A Justice Department press release stated, ""There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in the alleged unlawful activity."" To Pirro, this meant that Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller investigation, reached the conclusion that the Trump campaign did not collude with Russia during the election. But Rosenstein said no such thing. While briefing reporters the same day, Rosenstein made clear the investigation was ongoing. At no point did he indicate that the absence of charges against Americans in this particular indictment meant that Americans couldn’t be indicted in the future. Ironically, Pirro’s claim contains a footnote that severely undercuts her assertion. She cites an article from CNBC that emphasizes the opposite of her point. The article’s headline — ""Rosenstein: No Allegation of American Involvement or Election Impact — In this Particular Indictment"" — makes clear that Rosenstein was speaking narrowly about that particular indictment, and not the possibility of indictments against Americans at some future point. Here’s how the lead sentence of the Feb. 16 CNBC article reads: ""When Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein spoke to the press Friday, he repeatedly made it clear that his comments were specific to the federal grand jury indictment the special counsel's office had just announced."" Later, the CNBC article quotes a former assistant attorney general who further undermines Pirro’s point: ""The deputy attorney general's comments were not an ""all-clear"" signal for the president, former assistant attorney general John Carlin told CNBC. ""What you saw at the press conference is not an 'all-clear.' Instead it's a careful prosecutor sticking to the four corners of the indictment,"" Carlin said on ""Power Lunch."" ""Carlin, who previously was chief of staff to Mueller when he was director of the FBI, said that the investigation is not over and that Americans will ""have to just wait and see."""" Under the regulations that govern special counsel investigations, Mueller’s probe will end with a ""confidential report explaining the prosecution or declination decisions"" to the attorney general. There is no suggestion Mueller has submitted his final report yet, meaning the investigation is still active. To date, the investigation has swept up four members of Trump’s campaign, including three who have agreed to work with with the special counsel as part of a plea deal. As our timeline of the Mueller probe makes clear, the investigation has continued to evolve since February, when Pirro claims the collusion probe ended. On July 13, the special counsel indicted 12 Russian intelligence officers for their role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Clinton campaign, and the leaking of emails and documents. The indictment made reference to an unnamed U.S. person who ""was in regular contact with senior members of the presidential campaign of Donald J. Trump,"" and who communicated during the election with Guccifer 2.0, a front for Russian operatives. Former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone acknowledged he is ""probably"" the U.S. person referenced in the indictment. Stone’s acknowledgement came five months after Pirro claimed the collusion investigation had ended. Pirro said Rosenstein announced in February that ""the Russia collusion investigation is over."" Rosenstein, who oversees the Mueller investigation, said no such thing. He’s never suggested that an absence of charges against Americans in any given indictment means that Americans couldn’t be charged in the future. Pirro’s claim that the investigation ended in February is also at odds with how the probe has evolved since then. To take just one example, former Trump campaign adviser Roger Stone acknowledged he is ""probably"" the unnamed U.S. person referenced in the July 13 indictment of 12 Russian intelligence officers charged with hacking and leaking Democratic documents during the election.

"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says public favors defunding Obamacare but opposes government shutdown
","Sen. Marco Rubio is among the big names in the Republican Party salivating at the chance to defund Obamacare. But Florida’s Republican senator says there’s no need to shut down the federal government over it, and conveniently enough, he says the American public agrees with him on both fronts. After the U.S. House of Representatives passed a short-term continuing resolution to defund Obamacare and keep the federal government open, Rubio issued a press release on Sept. 20, 2013: ""The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government. The House voted today to follow the will of the American people and the Senate should now follow suit."" We decided to examine recent poll results to determine if Rubio correctly characterized the public’s view on Obamacare and a government shutdown. Polls about Obamacare  The Kaiser Family Foundation, a healthy policy think tank, has repeatedly asked respondents since 2011 if they approve or disapprove of cutting off funding for the health care law, formally called the Affordable Care Act. The most recent poll, in mid August 2013, showed that 57 percent disapproved of cutting funding, while 36 percent approved. Those numbers have changed little since 2011. A few days after Rubio made his claim, CNBC released a summary of a poll that found Americans oppose defunding Obamacare by a plurality of 44 percent to 38 percent. (Due to the timing, we will not take this poll into account for rating Rubio’s claim, but we’re mentioning it since it is on point.) CNBC’s pollsters noted that people particularly oppose defunding Obamacare if it would lead to a government shutdown or other dramatic outcomes. ""Opposition to defunding increases sharply when the issue of shutting down the government and defaulting is included. In that case, Americans oppose defunding 59 percent to 19 percent, with 18 percent of respondents unsure. The final 4 percent is a group of people who want to defund Obamacare, but become unsure when asked if they still hold that view if it means shutting down the government,"" stated the report. So where might Rubio get the idea that the majority of Americans support defunding Obamacare? We contacted spokespersons for Rubio for a response and didn’t hear back. But we did find an August poll released by the conservative group Heritage Action, the lobbying arm of the Heritage Foundation, which showed that 57 percent support defunding Obamacare. The poll done by Basswood Research also found that about 68 percent support temporarily halting funding to make sure the provisions ""do not do more harm than good."" The poll was conducted in 10 House districts -- six currently held by Republicans. But the Heritage poll was widely criticized as a push poll, including by the Washington Post’s conservative blogger Jennifer Rubin, who called it ""Heritage’s Junk Poll."" Still, many recent polls show either a majority or plurality of Americans are critical of Obamacare depending on how the question is asked. How is it that these people don’t also want to see it defunded? For an answer we turned to Robert Blendon, professor of health policy and political analysis at Harvard University. Not surprisingly, the answer is in the wording. When respondents are asked if they favor ""defunding"" Obamacare, they oppose that, Blendon said. But when respondents are asked if they support repealing the law, they support some type of repeal. For example, a July 2013 CBS poll found 39 percent support repealing the entire law and 18 percent support repealing the mandate. While Americans think the law spends too much money, they don’t want to cut it back to zero funding. The individual mandate is probably the most unpopular part of the bill, Blendon said. However, ""defunding doesn’t sound like a way to get rid of the individual mandate -- it sounds like you’re taking money away from sick people."" If President Barack Obama wants to keep the bill as is and Republicans want to repeal it, Blendon said, then the public ""is in the middle, which is to keep some and get rid of some. ... Neither party is giving them exactly what it is they want."" Polls about government shutdown As for a government shutdown, the polls we found -- whether by an impartial media outlet or the right or the left -- showed the majority of Americans opposed. A CNN/ORC poll conducted Sept. 6-8 found that if the federal government had to shut down for a few days, 38 percent said it would cause ""major problems,"" and 11 percent said it would cause a ""crisis."" When asked about a shutdown lasting for a few weeks, about three-fourths said it would cause major problems or a crisis. A poll done for Republican members of Congress found a significant majority oppose a government shutdown. A poll done for the conservative Crossroads GPS found that despite opposition to Obamacare, voters say it’s a bad idea to risk shutting down the government. ""Only tea party backers embrace the idea, while independents reject it two-to-one,"" stated the Crossroads GPS poll. A poll for the liberal Huffington Post found a majority believe a shutdown would hurt the economy. Finally, we found one poll, a Washington Post/ABC News poll from Sept. 12-15,  that came close to combining the moves of defunding Obamacare and a government shutdown, but it didn’t actually use the phrase ""government shutdown."" Instead, it asked if people favored or opposed the health care law (not defunding it) and then asked those who opposed the law if they favored ""shutting down major activities of the federal government."" According to the Post, the poll found that ""only about one-quarter of Americans (27 percent) want Congress to shut down the government rather than pass a budget that funds Obamacare -- a threat that is inherent in some GOP lawmakers' pledges not to support any such budget. (Another 20 percent oppose Obamacare but don't want to risk a shutdown, while 5 percent oppose the law but aren't sure what they want to come from budget negotiations.)"" Our ruling Rubio said, ""The American people support defunding Obamacare and oppose shutting down the government."" Rubio makes it sound like he has support from the public for his main objective, which is defunding Obamacare. He doesn’t. When asking the public about Obamacare, word choice matters, and ""defund"" leads to a different result than ""repeal."" While the law isn’t popular, a recent Kaiser poll found 57 percent opposed cutting off funding. On his second point, he’s right that most people tell pollsters they don’t want a government shutdown. But we’ll point out that both sides in the budget battle in Congress say they don’t want a shutdown.

McConnell links Obama to war on coal
","The unveiling of proposed regulations to limit greenhouse gas emissions from new power plants stirred up protests that the administration is waging ""a war on coal."" Under these rules, newly built coal-fired facilities could not release more than 1,100 pounds of carbon dioxide per megawatt-hour. The most advanced plant today releases over 1,600 pounds. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R- Ky., faces re-election next year. Just before the announcement, his campaign posted an ad on the Web called ""Stand for coal."" The ad uses excerpts from what sounds like a public speech by McConnell. Here’s how it begins: I don’t have to tell you there’s a war on coal here in America, and it’s really come home here in Kentucky. The president’s own advisers have said there’s a war on coal. And I want to remind people that whether they live in a coal county or not, a war on coal is a war on Kentucky, all of Kentucky. Because our great competitive advantage has been low utility rates. This administration, whether it’s Obamacare or the war on coal, needs to be stopped. And I tell you, I will be the leader of the forces that take on the war on coal. The second sentence stands out. It would be politically inflammatory if the president’s team was talking about waging a war on coal. More than 50 Democratic lawmakers come from coal-producing states, and they eye this issue warily. We decided to look at the substance behind McConnell’s claim that ""the president’s own advisers have said there’s a war on coal."" We emailed McConnell’s campaign, and they pointed to several news articles from June of this year. The articles reference Daniel Schrag, a Harvard geochemist and a member of President Barack Obama’s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology. They quote Schrag telling the New York Times that, ""Politically, the White House is hesitant to say they’re having a war on coal. On the other hand, a war on coal is exactly what’s needed."" We’ll work through the three elements of McConnell’s claim one by one. Is Schrag an adviser? By title, Schrag is certainly an adviser. The president’s advisory council has 18 members and includes the former chief of Google, the president of Yale, chemists, biologists, physicists and computer scientists. It meets about seven times a year and the members talk about everything from city planning to mathematics education, from health care to information technology. Earlier this year, the council sent a letter to Obama suggesting half a dozen factors to include in his climate change policy. On that list, it recommended doing more to ""decarbonize"" the economy. It noted the administration’s ""efforts to increase coal’s usability through development of carbon capture and storage,"" and said the White House should speed that process along. One caveat: Most of the actual policy-making on climate change takes place at the Environmental Protection Agency and at the Department of Energy. We contacted Schrag and he said he was expressing his own views, not those of the administration. ""I do not have that knowledge nor that authority,"" Schrag said. Schrag said he has never met one-on-one with the president. Obama has met with the council as a whole a handful of times. Did more than one adviser say this? McConnell used the plural. ""The president’s own advisers have said,"" was his phrase. The McConnell campaign did not identify any advisers other than Schrag. We could find no others. There is no evidence that we are dealing with more than a single adviser. Did Schrag say ""we have a war on coal""? It is clear that Schrag himself would like to see a war on coal. However, he said he regrets using that term. ""A ‘war on coal’ is taken as an attack on coal miners, etc., and that was not my intention,"" he said. ""I don't want to fight a war on anyone. Indeed, I am a strong supporter of coal plants with carbon capture and storage."" Schrag said his actual words have been twisted. ""I never said that there was a war on coal. My statement was that, in my own personal opinion, a war on coal is needed -- not that the administration is waging a war on coal,"" Schrag said. Schrag does not say he was misquoted as such. Let’s look at his words again: ""Politically, the White House is hesitant to say they’re having a war on coal. On the other hand, a war on coal is exactly what’s needed."" It is possible to interpret those words as saying, ""There is a war on coal but no one wants to say so."" But it is also possible to interpret them as, ""I think there should be a war on coal but the administration isn’t there yet."" A look at the headlines of the articles McConnell’s campaign sent us tends to support the second interpretation. The Washington Post had ""Obama science adviser calls for ‘war on coal’."" The Washington Times had ""Obama science adviser urges ‘war on coal’.""  The Washington Times item said ""One of the White House’s advisers on climate change said that President Obama should use his global warming speech Tuesday to launch a ‘war on coal’."" If the administration did have a war on coal, there would be no reason for Schrag to say it was time to launch one. We should note that the original quote from Shrag in the New York Times was removed at some point from the New York Times story. There is no explanation by the New York Times as to why the quote was removed. Conservative bloggers noted the alteration of the story and copied the original context of Schrag’s quote. Daniel P. Schrag, a geochemist who is the head of Harvard University’s Center for the Environment and a member of a presidential science panel that has helped advise the White House on climate change, said he hoped the presidential speech would mark a turning point in the national debate on climate change. ""Everybody is waiting for action,"" he said. ""The one thing the president really needs to do now is to begin the process of shutting down the conventional coal plants. Politically, the White House is hesitant to say they’re having a war on coal. On the other hand, a war on coal is exactly what’s needed."" The administration’s policy on coal The core of the president’s coal policy is clean coal. In practice, that means creating new methods to capture and store the carbon released when coals burns. The White House said the administration has spent about $6 billion to develop clean coal technology. Staff also pointed to an $8 billion loan guarantee program under the Department of Energy that has just begun. Under the program, private investors can apply to the government to eliminate the risk to lenders who put money behind a clean coal project. Recently, the head of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, told a House committee that, ""We believe coal will continue to represent a significant portion of the energy supply in the decades to come."" Administration critics say its policies will produce a different result. The Institute for Energy Research favors deregulation and is headed by the former policy chief at Enron. The group posted an article on its website, ""EPA emissions rule will destroy U.S. coal industry."" The institute argues that the proposed rules ""will deny U.S. citizens the right to have new generating facilities built using coal."" The biggest problem for coal right now seems to be the market. While coal remains the primary fuel for producing electricity, it is losing ground against much cheaper natural gas. Utilities are shedding coal fired generators and adding ones powered by natural gas. According to reports on planned capacity changes submitted to the government’s Energy Information Administration, by 2016, there will be a net loss of 149 coal-fired generators and a net gain of 120 that use natural gas. Our ruling McConnell said, ""The president’s own advisers have said there’s a war on coal."" A man who sits on a presidential advisory council did speak of a war on coal. It is accurate to call him an adviser. It is inaccurate to refer to more than one adviser but much more significant, it also falls wide of the mark to interpret his words as meaning that there is a war on coal. The adviser expressed support for that sort of policy, but press accounts at the time and the adviser’s own words today affirm that he did not say there is presently a war on coal. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/23/mitch-mcconnell/mcconnell-links-obama-war-coal/
"['Polls and Public Opinion', 'Texas', 'Jason Stanford']","
Contradictory poll at heart of Democrat’s claim about Fort Worth senator’s popularity
","Texas Sen. Wendy Davis ""has a rare opportunity to start her first statewide campaign as the most popular politician in Texas,"" wrote Democratic political consultant Jason Stanford in a Sept. 16, 2013, opinion column. That day’s ""Two Views"" feature in the Austin American-Statesman’s opinion section featured Stanford and Republican counterpart Matt Mackowiak weighing in on Davis’ chances if she runs for governor. The Fort Worth Democrat gained global fame for her 11-hour filibuster June 25, 2013, that helped briefly derail GOP-sponsored restrictions on abortions. Mackowiak opined that Texas won’t be blue enough in 2014 to elect a Democrat. But how red can the state be if Davis is tops in popularity, as Stanford asserted? By phone, Stanford told us he was relying on his memory of Davis’ favorability rating in poll results released July 2, 2013, by Public Policy Polling. The Democratic-leaning North Carolina firm said in a press release that in its survey conducted June 28-July 1, 2013 -- days after the filibuster -- Davis was ""now the best-liked figure the firm tested statewide, and the third-best-known after (Gov.) Rick Perry and (U.S. Sen.) Ted Cruz,"" both Republican.  ""But her standing in a hypothetical matchup with Perry has slipped in the last five months, mainly due to Perry’s own improvement,"" the release said, and survey data suggested that Davis also would have lost in a one-on-one gubernatorial face-off with Attorney General Greg Abbott, then a likely GOP candidate. Abbott announced his bid for governor after Perry said July 8 that he would not run again. Davis isn’t officially in the race; she has said she’ll announce ""what’s next"" for her Oct. 3. The survey was carried out via automated phone calls to 500 registered Texas voters, with an overall margin of error of plus or minus 4.4 percent. Although only six politicians were compared in that release, other Public Policy releases show the firm tested 10 politicians’ favorability in the June-July survey: five Democrats (President Barack Obama, Davis, former Houston mayor and 2010 Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White, San Antonio Mayor Julián Castro and Houston Mayor Annise Parker) and five Republicans (U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, Cruz, Perry, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst and Abbott). With all 10 politicians considered, Davis dropped to fifth ""best-known"" -- behind Obama, Perry, Cruz and Cornyn. Public Policy spokesman Dustin Ingalls told us by phone that with Cornyn’s recognition only one percentage point above Davis’, it would be fair to say Davis was tied for third ""best-known"" among Texas figures. Davis still had the highest favorability margin, which Public Policy measured by asking, ""Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of Wendy Davis?"" Ingalls said his firm subtracted the percentage of ""unfavorable"" responses from the ""favorable"" ones to calculate a margin. Davis’ margin was 10, because 39 percent of respondents replied ""favorable"" and 29 percent replied ""unfavorable."" For comparison, Obama’s margin was -14 (41 percent favorable minus 55 percent unfavorable) and Perry’s was -5 (45 percent favorable to 50 percent unfavorable). As those percentages indicate, fewer respondents ventured an opinion on Davis than on Perry. That’s how Public Policy measured name recognition in this survey, Ingalls said -- totaling the favorable and unfavorable opinions. So Obama was ""best known"" because 96 percent of respondents had an opinion about him, as might be expected for a U.S. president partway through his second term. Similarly, 95 percent of respondents had a viewpoint on Perry, who’s been governor since 2000. For both Cornyn and Davis, about a third of respondents had no opinion or said they were unsure; Public Policy rated their name recognition at 69 percent and 68 percent, respectively, though Cornyn has represented Texas in the U.S. Senate since 2003 and Davis was elected to the state Senate in 2008. Those figures suggested to us another way to view the poll results: looking at the raw number of people who had positive or negative views on the politicians. For example, with 500 respondents in the poll, Davis’ 39 percent positive reviews should equal about 195 Texans with a favorable opinion of her. Viewed this way, Perry comes out tops, with 45 percent ""favorable"" answers equating to 225 people; Cruz next, with 42 percent positive results representing 210 people; Obama with 41 percent, about 205 people; then Davis’ 195. Ingalls said his firm uses percentages and margins to describe favorability because raw-number counts are affected by how well-known the politicians are and margins factor in how many people dislike the politicians, not just how many people like them. Austin Democratic pollster Jeff Smith, whose opinion we sought via email, noted that although Public Policy described the poll results as measuring Perry’s favorability, they actually asked respondents to rate Perry’s ""job performance,"" not Perry himself. Also, Smith and others we consulted were skeptical about using the poll to determine who’s ""most popular"" in Texas. Austin pollster Mike Baselice, who has counseled Perry and numerous Republican candidates, told us by email, ""Polls are like balance sheets. They measure opinions at a given point in time."" Along the same lines, Stanford’s colleague Mackowiak told us by email he thought the poll was ""virtually worthless"" because it was taken ""at the height of the filibuster drama."" Smith said, ""The only way to fact-check this statement is to look at other recent polls."" Anything before the filibuster ""is irrelevant,"" he cautioned. Stanford agreed: ""Using the polls from before the filibuster is as accurate as measuring my height when I was a child."" We found no other post-filibuster surveys checking Davis’ popularity. Two conducted earlier in 2013 showed, unsurprisingly, a lower statewide profile for her. A Public Policy survey conducted Jan. 24-27, 2013, sampling registered Texas voters and Texas GOP primary voters, ranked Davis’ popularity margin ninth among 11 politicians and her ""name recognition"" 10th out of 11. Parker was 11th in recognition; by favorability margin, Obama tied Davis for ninth and Perry was 11th. A University of Texas/Texas Tribune Poll conducted May 30-June 9, 2013, asked 1,200 registered Texas voters whether they had ""a very favorable, somewhat favorable, neither favorable nor unfavorable, somewhat unfavorable, or very unfavorable opinion of"" Cruz, Cornyn, Dewhurst, Perry, Abbott, Republican House speaker Rep. Joe Straus, Davis and Castro. Here, pre-filibuster Davis got 77 percent neutral answers (""don’t know/no opinion"" and ""neither favorable nor unfavorable""), more than any other politician. Among respondents who did offer an opinion of her, 11 percent were positive (""very"" and ""somewhat"" favorable) and 12 percent were negative (""very"" and ""somewhat"" unfavorable). Perry had the most positive responses (41 percent), but also the most negative responses (42 percent). Cruz was next with 40 percent positive and 31 percent negative responses. Using such totals to approximate the way Public Policy calculated favorability margins, we found Abbott and Cruz had the highest (9) and Perry tied with Davis in the bottom half of the pack (-1). Bits of anecdotal evidence were intriguing. For example, the Texas Tribune reported in an Aug. 28, 2013, news story that Davis ""saw her followers on Twitter rise from 1,200"" before the filibuster ""to more than 140,000 today."" Without trying to separate Texas followers from U.S. or worldwide followers -- Does Davis have more ""likes"" in London? Do other red-state tweeters follow Abbott? -- we aren’t sure what the heck social stats show about politicians’ popularity in Texas, but we gathered a few just to see what they were. Davis’ Twitter and Facebook stats look high at first glance, but she has only one account on each platform. Abbott, Cornyn, Cruz and Perry have campaign and official accounts on both; that means their followers could be spread out and also means there is likely some degree of overlap. Social media connections: Facebook likes and Twitter followers As of mid-September 2013 Personal and/or campaign Twitter Official Twitter Personal and/or campaign Facebook Official Facebook Abbott 22,943 5,794 172,481 3,151 Cornyn 441 campaign 49,090 59,314 29,936 Cruz 123,281 126,115 218,575 115,021 Davis 143,088 No account 282,251 No account Perry 199,257 personal 28,154 campaign 31,732 220,109 12,999 Sources: @GregAbbott_TX, @TXAGsOffice, facebook.com/TexansForAbbott, facebook.com/TexasAttorneyGeneral, @TeamCornyn, @JohnCornyn, facebook.com/tedcruzpage, facebook.com/SenatorTedCruz, @WendyDavisTexas, facebook.com/WendyDavisTexas, @GovernorPerry, @TeamRickPerry, @TexGov, facebook.com/GovernorPerry, facebook.com/TexasGovernor   Two conclusions are clear: Perry’s personal Twitter account has nearly 200,000 followers to Davis’ 143,000 on her campaign Twitter feed. And on either Facebook or Twitter, Davis’s single account has more followers than Abbott’s and Cornyn’s campaign and official accounts combined. If viewed separately, Cruz’s accounts don’t outweigh Davis’ accounts, but add together his campaign and official Facebook likes or Twitter followers and he would outpace Davis. Without knowing how much the Cruz accounts overlap, the safest assumption is that Davis lately trumps some of her colleagues on social media, but not all of them. Another unscientific measure: As of Sept. 16, 2013, Cruz was leading Davis in the Dallas Morning News’ online poll asking readers which one newspaper’s editors should choose as ""Texan of the Year"" for 2013 (the choices were Cruz, Davis and ""Other"").

Rick Scott says you need a license to fish on the beach. Really?
","Indulge us this fantasy: Beckoned by summer’s end, you escape work early and head for the sandy shores of your favorite Florida beach. It’s fishing time! As you stand near gentle waves, fishing rod in hand, an authority figure approaches with a buzzkill of a question: Where’s your license, pal? My what? Yep, there’s really a requirement for a saltwater shoreline fishing license under state law. We were as surprised to hear about it as Gov. Rick Scott during his recent ""listening tour"" for tax and fee cuts around the state. ""You have to get a license to fish on our beaches. I didn't know that,"" Scott told health care workers in Tampa on Sept. 18. ""We're going to get rid of that."" Good news for amateur anglers: It’s free to state residents (not counting convenience fees for ordering by phone or Internet). So repealing it is a freebie for Scott’s promise to cut $500 million in taxes and fees. Florida used to have no such requirement, but the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission requested it during the 2009 legislative session. Otherwise, a federal registration requirement carrying a $15-$25 fee would have gone into effect in 2011, according to a Q&A about the license. ""I think it’s important for people to realize that fish and wildlife resources belong to everyone,"" said FWC spokesman Gary Morse. ""One of the most important reasons that we have to have the license is for the ability to manage our fisheries. We need to know how much pressure is being put on the fishery for both commercial (purposes) and recreation."" With more information in hand, officials can make better decisions about fishing rules and regulations, he said. Popped for fishing on the beach without a license? Officials generally issue a warning -- the first time, Morse said. After that there could be fines. The shoreline license only covers people fishing from land or a structure attached to land, not someone fishing from a boat or a shore reached by boat. Wading into the water is okay, as long as you can stand on the bottom. You don’t have to have the free version if you already possess a saltwater fishing license (annual license starts at $17) or if you are under age 16 or a senior resident. There’s an exemption from the shoreline license for people approved for food stamps, temporary cash assistance or Medicaid by the Department of Children and Families. Actually, there are a lot of regulations and exemptions with all fishing licenses, and you can read more about them from FWC here. (If you want to avoid registration altogether, the state offers two upcoming license-free saltwater fishing days on Oct. 12 and Nov. 30.) Scott may have said he wants to get rid of the requirement, but his press office said there are no plans to formally propose a repeal. As for his statement about needing a license to fish on the beach, we found nothing fishy about it.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Brian Robinson']","
Does education budget claim add up?
","There have been some interesting moves in the political chess match between Gov. Nathan Deal and Georgia Schools Superintendent John Barge. Barge made the first by surprising the political establishment with his interest, and eventual announcement, that he would challenge the fellow Republican for his job in 2014. Deal made the next move. The governor’s camp attempted to take away the main issue his new opponent will campaign on in advance of the Republican Party primary -- education. ""Governor Deal has increased education spending every year he’s been in office,"" said his spokesman, Brian Robinson. Checkmate? PolitiFact Georgia decided to do some homework on this claim, considering the likelihood that the Deal campaign may present this point again. Georgia’s budget runs on a 12-month fiscal year cycle. The current fiscal year began July 1 and ends June 30, 2014. Deal took office in January 2011. Education typically accounts for the biggest spending item in the state budget. This fiscal year, the Georgia Legislature agreed to spend about $7.4 billion on k-12 education. The entire state budget was nearly $20 billion. Georgia gets additional money from the federal government and other sources. That figure has declined from about $2.8 billion in fiscal year 2011 to about $1.7 billion in each year since. Robinson said he was referring to the total amount of money budgeted for the state’s Education Department at the end of the fiscal year. In most years, those numbers are adjusted as state revenue increases or declines and departments make additional budget requests. FY 2011: $7,067,414,444 FY 2012: $7,075,837,688 FY 2013 $7,326,807,956 The budget adopted for Fiscal Year 2014 was $7,409,293,094. The numbers matched fiscal year funding data from the Education Department. In each fiscal year, as Robinson said, the final budget numbers for the state Education Department increased. But is that the whole story? Georgia’s public school enrollment has increased by about 28,000 students, to nearly 1.7 million pupils, in the three budget cycles since Deal took office. Some people we contacted noted the enrollment increase as we conducted our research. The education budget has risen by a slightly larger percentage than student enrollment, we found. Others say there’s some context that Robinson’s numbers miss. The Georgia School Boards Association says Deal is not devoting enough money toward education if you factor in inflation. The Washington-based Center on Budget and Policy Priorities released a report earlier this month that concluded Georgia’s per-student spending will decline by about 1 percent this year once you factor in inflation. The center, a left-leaning organization, found Georgia has spent nearly 15 percent less on students since fiscal year 2008. Only seven states spent a lower percentage on students, according to the report. The left-leaning Georgia Budget Policy Institute, which has pushed state leaders to spend more on education, has looked at the education budget under Deal. It found the education budget has increased by 1.5 percent since Deal took office, as adjusted for inflation. The U.S. inflation rate has risen by 3 percent to 4 percent since 2011, according to data we reviewed. There’s been a 4 percent increase in the final state education budgets since Deal took office.   The institute released a report earlier this year that concluded the education budget is $1 billion less than what schools should get under Georgia’s complicated Quality Basic Education formula. Claire Suggs, the institute’s senior education policy analyst, said the education budget has been underfunded for several years. Here’s a recent breakdown of the QBE funding gap, also known as ""austerity cuts."" The numbers came from the Georgia Department of Education. FY 2011:    $1,089,521,696 FY 2012:    $1,147,859,436 FY 2013:    $1,143,762,797 FY 2014:    $1,061,127,407 Since the 2003 fiscal year, state leaders have subtracted hundreds of millions of dollars from the funding formula every year. Initially, they said the austerity cuts were necessary because of a budget deficit, but the yearly cuts continued even after state revenue improved, The Atlanta Journal Constitution has reported. ""It’s not been addressed,"" Suggs said of the issue. State Sen. Fran Millar, a Dunwoody Republican who served as chairman of the Senate's Education and Youth Committee, said he believed Robinson is correct, citing recent year-end budget numbers for the department. Millar also said austerity cuts for the Education Department have been less than other departments. ""I think what they’re saying is true,"" Millar said of Robinson’s claim. To sum up, Deal’s spokesman said education spending has increased every year since his administration took office in January 2011. Robinson’s numbers are correct. But there’s some context missing here. There have been continued ""austerity cuts."" And some would say there’s little or no increase once you factor in inflation.

Cuccinell ad says McAuliffe ""cashed in"" on the demise of Global Crossing
","Republican Ken Cuccinelli claims in a TV ad that Democrat Terry McAuliffe walked away with millions of dollars  from a company that went bankrupt and left thousands without jobs and retirement savings. The 30-second spot focuses on McAuliffe’s relationship with Global Crossings, a start-up  fiber-optic company whose stock soared in the late 1990s and crashed in 2002. The commercial starts with footage of a fenced-in, abandoned plant, and shifts to interviews with former employees. Here’s the script: Narrator: ""January 2002. New York firm Global Crossing filed for bankruptcy."" Corey Darrow, former worker: ""I lost all my severance. Lost all the money in my 401k."" Deb Goehring, former worker: ""Got locked out. And that was it. My career was over."" Narrator: ""Yet political insider and investor Terry McAuliffe cashed in, walking away with millions."" Gary Baron, former worker: ""Probably had some insider knowledge. There’s a lot of lies to make money for themselves."" Darrow: ""You know, it’s like they took my money and ran."" Narrator: ""That’s the real Terry McAuliffe."" We took a look at whether McAuliffe really did enrich himself on the company’s demise. The ad has been controversial since its release on Sept. 6. Two of the former employees in the ad told Mother Jones magazine  they thought they were being interviewed for a documentary and did not know their words would be used in a political commercial. Cuccinelli’s campaign says the former employees knew how their comments would be used and sent us a long list of articles detailing Global Crossing’s rise and fall and McAuliffe’s ties to the firm. The relationship began in 1997, a year after McAuliffe helped President Bill Clinton get reelected by serving as his chief fundraiser. McAuliffe was retained as a dealmaker by Gary Winnick, a Los Angeles billionaire investor who was starting Global Crossing Holdings, a telecommunications company that would own and operate undersea fiber-optic cables. McAuliffe invested $100,000 of his own money in Global Crossing stock before it was publicly offered. McAuliffe, in a 1999 story in The New York Times, said Winnick ""wanted a stable of people around him with great contacts"" to ""help him work on details."" McAuliffe said in the article that ""Winnick was looking for a little political action."" McAuliffe’s retainer with Winnick ended in 1998. But he was allowed to hold on the stock, which rocketed in the dot.com boom. Cuccinelli’s ad contains a picture of McAuliffe smiling and the printed words, ""Made a profit of $18 million.""  That comes from the 1999 Times article in which McAuliffe said the value of his $100,000 investment in Global Crossing had risen to about $18 million. But that’s not the amount McAuliffe pocketed. McAuliffe said during his unsuccessful 2009 gubernatorial campaign that he ended up making $8 million, a figure that was confirmed that year by Associated Press, which was given access to McAuliffe’s trading records. ""His return was $8.1 million, mostly on the sale of 176,017 shares in 1999, the year Global Crossing stock peaked beyond $60 a share,"" the AP reported. ""He could have made much more -- closer to the $18 million in some published reports -- had he sold all of his shares in 1999,"" the AP wrote. ""Stock transaction records he provided to the AP show his last shares were sold in January 2002, after the company’s stock had plunged to 14 cents a share. And, as McAuliffe notes, he was never a board member or officer of the company."" The first sign of Global’s demise, according to The Times, came in April 2001 when officers were told revenues were going to fall $1 billion short of earning estimates. That was about two years after McAuliffe made his stock killing. Cuccinelli’s ad, without directly saying so, links McAuliffe’s profit to the downfall of Global Crossing, which caused about 12,000 workers to lose their jobs and retirement funds. The company froze their pensions and invested their 401 (k) retirement savings in Global Crossing stock, which became worthless. But none of the three former employees in the ad mentions McAuliffe by name. Two of the workers placed the blame on an unidentified ""they"" and ""them."" And the third employee, Deb Goehring, has told Mother Jones magazine and The Virginian-Pilot that she bears no animus towards McAuliffe. ""I said I don't really know anything about Terry McAuliffe,"" she told Mother Jones. ""He was not involved in day-to-day operations in any way that I saw. As far as I'm concerned, he was like me, a stockholder, and he was able to make money at it. More power to the man. Good for him."" McAuliffe’s campaign, in responding to the ad, has stressed that McAuliffe ""had no role in running the company"" and that his Global Crossing holdings were a tiny fraction of the $20 billion value of the company’s in stock estimated by Forbes Magazine in April 1999. Chris LaCivita, Cuccinelli’s chief strategist, says the ad shows ""Winnick provided an insider deal that proved very lucrative for McAuliffe, despite thousands losing their jobs. McAuliffe has spent his entire career connecting wealthy donors to elected officials and leveraging those contacts to make a fortune for himself, while workers get left out in the cold."" Our ruling McAuliffe made a fantastic profit through an insider deal that allowed him to buy Global Crossing stock before it was offered to the public. Cuccinelli’s ad, without directly saying so, clearly links McAuliffe’s gain to the downfall of the company and the woes of its employees. There’s no evidence McAuliffe had a management role in Global Crossing. He was an investor who bought low and sold about half of his holdings at peak value. He held on to the rest of his shares until they were virtually worthless. All of the shares were publicly traded, so it’s far-fetched to suggest McAuliffe raided the company’s coffers.

"['New Jersey', 'Education', 'Barbara Buono']","
Barbara Buono claims Rutgers tuition has spiked 10 percent since Chris Christie's been governor
","Death and taxes aren’t the only sure things in New Jersey. Increasing college tuition costs are pretty much a given, too – especially on Gov. Chris Christie’s watch, according to state Sen. Barbara Buono (D-Middlesex), who is challenging Christie, a Republican, in the Nov. 5 gubernatorial contest. Rutgers tuition has increased 10 percent since Christie took office because he ""cut funding for higher education,"" Buono told students during a recent stop at the university's New Brunswick campus. While the cost of an education at Rutgers and other schools in New Jersey has certainly risen in recent years, we were a bit stunned by this Rutgers Law School alumna’s claim: not only has tuition at the state university climbed by less than 10 percent from the time Christie became governor in January 2010 to present, Buono’s putting blame where it doesn’t belong. Let’s start by reviewing tuition costs for Rutgers since Christie’s been in office. Tuition for in-state residents at Rutgers was $9,926 for the 2010-2011 academic year -- the first year that a Rutgers budget was crafted during Christie’s tenure as governor. Tuition is $10,718 for the current 2013-2014 academic calendar. That’s an increase of 7.97 percent, not 10 percent. David Turner, a Buono for Governor spokesman, told us it would be more appropriate to compare tuition and fees from 2009-2010 – before Christie took office – to 2013-2014. So we looked at those numbers, too. Tuition and fees for 2009-2010 was $11,886, compared with $13,499 for the current academic year. That’s an increase of 13.57 percent, which is in line with Buono’s claim. But there’s a key difference: Buono specifically referenced a tuition increase so we removed fees from the equation and compared tuition from 2009-2010 ($9,546) with 2013-2014 ($10,718). The difference is an increase of 12.27 percent. That brings us to another critical point: Buono claims the increase has occurred ""since Christie took office."" Turner said Christie's cuts to education had long-reaching effects on students. ""One of the Governor's first major acts was to slash New Jersey's higher education budget by more than $170 million,"" he said in an e-mail. ""By cutting the budget, the costs fell on to students who are now shouldering a 13% increase in tuition at our flagship university. These cuts unfairly place the burden on students and make it harder for them to get the skills they need to compete in the workforce of tomorrow."" Christie in 2010 proposed cutting $173 million from higher education funding as the state faced a variety of deficits at the height of the recession. But is he solely to blame for tuition hikes at Rutgers? No. In fact, the governor of New Jersey has nothing to do with setting tuition costs at colleges and universities. Under state law, the Rutgers Board of Governors sets tuition and determines the rates of tuition for the institution as part of the university’s annual budget, a spokesman told us. Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak agreed. ""Governors have no role in setting tuition, room/board and various fees at Rutgers,"" Drewniak explained in an e-mail. ""The Board of Governors votes annually to set those rates based on recommendations from the school’s administrators. Surely, the Senator knows this given her vast experience in the legislature."" It’s worth noting that impacts from the recession also were being felt statewide at that time, even in education. The National Bureau of Economic Research defines the recession as lasting from December 2007 to June 2009. Our ruling Buono said during a recent visit to Rutgers that the university's tuition has increased 10 percent since Christie took office because he ""cut funding for higher education."" When looking strictly at tuition costs, Rutgers tuition has increased 7.97 percent from the 2010-2011 academic year -- the first Rutgers budget done after Christie became governor -- to the current 2013-2014. The increase, however,  is 12.27 percent if measured from the year before Christie became governor. As for blame, state law makes clear that the Rutgers Board of Governors -- not the governor himself -- sets tuition rates for the university. And while it's true that Christie did cut education funding, he doesn't bare the bulk of the blame for the tuition hikes. Many factors were involved. As a result, we rate this claim Half True.

Dale Kooyenga says state using tougher accounting standards
","Dale Kooyenga is a certified public accountant, though he says if he’s at a party, ""accounting is not on my top 10 list of fun things to talk about."" But as a Republican member of the Assembly, Kooyenga is plenty happy to discuss the accounting arts as part of the ""CPA Caucus."" When the group dug into the University of Wisconsin System’s books and publicized what members considered an overly large reserve fund, Gov. Scott Walker and GOP lawmakers wound up reducing the system’s budget increase. As a result, when Kooyenga talks accounting at the Capitol, people listen. Even when -- perhaps especially when -- he’s commenting on something as dry as Wisconsin’s poor national ranking on budget deficits as measured by ""generally accepted accounting principles."" Those principles, known as GAAP for short, are a core issue when it comes to how state government spends tax dollars. Kooyenga says adopting the principles would rule out ""games,"" ""deceptive accounting practices"" and ""gimmicks"" that hold back the state’s credit rating and enable lawmakers to saddle future generations with unsustainable financial obligations. On Sept. 18, 2013, Kooyenga cited GAAP after hearing a state investment board official laud the fully-funded status of the state pension fund in testimony before the Legislature’s Joint Committee on Finance. ""Before we applaud ourselves, there’s a reason that Wisconsin has a 100 percent  funded pension system but we have the fourth-highest GAAP deficit in the country,"" Kooyenga said, mentioning a couple of the aforementioned accounting gimmicks. ""So I hope we can work on that over time -- which we have."" He concluded: ""We’ve used GAAP accounting here in this building the last two years."" That last phrase is worth checking, because the back-and-forth over budgets is heating up as we approach the 2014 gubernatorial race. Gov. Scott Walker actually campaigned on GAAP as an issue in 2010, contending that then-Gov. Jim Doyle had falsely claimed the state’s budget was balanced. He promised to balance the budget not only by the usual Madison standard, but also under the GAAP scorecard -- and to do it in every budget, just as local units of government do. State lawyers long ago said the constitutional requirement to balance the state budget could be done mostly on a simple cash basis -- not the accrual method called for by GAAP. And that’s been just fine with the political set in Madison. Why? Lawmakers and the governor would have to cut $2 billion to $3 billion more from the budget to fully balance under the more stringent GAAP standards. That $2 billion to $3 billion represents the ""GAAP deficit."" And it’s been in that range most years since 2002. So, how has GAAP been applied in recent years? Talk of change aside, the fact remains that neither party and no governor -- including Walker -- has balanced the budget without a GAAP deficit since the state started tracking it in 1990. We gave Walker a Promise Broken when his first proposed budget (2011-’13) not only left a GAAP deficit intact, but increased the size of it, to $3 billion. The governor’s second budget (2013-’15) went even further the other way, estimating a 29 percent increase in that deficit. Those facts put Kooyenga’s claim into a hole right off the bat. Neither budget was prepared using GAAP or balanced by those principles. And Kooyenga supported both budgets. Kooyenga’s case We spoke with Kooyenga and checked the long history of GAAP deficits and found an element of truth in his claim, which is vague enough to leave it open to some interpretation. Kooyenga referred to the ""last two years,"" 2011 and 2012. That coincides with his first two years in office and with Walker’s first two-year budget. Looking just at the final adopted version of that budget, it turns out that some tangible GAAP progress was made. That’s mainly because after Walker submitted his spending plan, a new revenue estimate gave lawmakers another $600 million to play with. Lawmakers chose to use a big chunk of the windfall to pay some big bills left behind from Doyle’s days -- a move that cut significantly into the GAAP deficit. We now know, based on actual results, that the first year of that budget (2011-’12) saw nearly an $800 million drop in the size of the GAAP deficit. It was the first drop in eight years, though it still left a long ways to go to be fully balanced under GAAP. As for year two, we won’t know the results until the books are closed on 2013. But experienced forecasters in the independent Legislative Fiscal Bureau and at the Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance say the GAAP deficit is very likely to shrink again. Walker and his Republican legislative allies have rejuvenated the state’s rainy day fund, and fund balances are running well into the black, both of which are positive factors in driving down the GAAP number. That, Kooyenga told us, is in part what he was referring to when he said ""we’ve used GAAP."" The ""we"" in his statement, he said, refers also to the CPA Caucus. That caucus has publicly tracked and reported how budget decisions look under GAAP. And Kooyenga went door to door in the Assembly to get bipartisan support for a constitutional amendment requiring the use of GAAP principles. That measure passed the Assembly in 2012 but died in the Senate. Still, the state continues to use accounting maneuvers such as manipulating the timing of huge aid payments to local governments and schools into future fiscal years. Such moves help elected officials balance the budget on paper -- but run afoul of GAAP. Those maneuvers were in the final version of the 2011-13 budget. Our rating Kooyenga said ""We’ve used (generally accepted accounting principles) here in this building the last two years."" State officials, including Kooyenga and his caucus, have partially ""used"" significant moves to improve the GAAP deficit picture, and they have increased public awareness of it. But those principles certainly haven’t been fully put to use; not even close. Most of the GAAP deficit remained after those two years. And left unmentioned by Kooyenga is that much of the progress in decreasing it is projected to be reversed in fiscal 2014 and 2015.

Crossfire anchor undershoots on Texans comprising one in 10 of the nation's minimum-wage workers
","As of July 2012, Texans accounted for nearly one in 10 Americans, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. On CNN’S Crossfire Sept. 18, 2013, from-the-left co-host Stephanie Cutter prefaced questions of Texas Gov. Rick Perry by saying: ""One out of 10 minimum-wage workers in the U.S. live in Texas."" She undershot. In 2012, according to Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Texas workers paid at or below the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour accounted for 452,000, or nearly 13 percent, of the nation’s 3,550,000 workers paid minimum wage or less. ""Another way of stating that is that in Texas, 7.5 (percent) of all hourly-paid workers were paid at or below the federal minimum wage,"" Abbot said by email. The same year, Abbot said, nearly 12.7 million Texas workers in total amounted to 8 percent of the nation’s 155-million-strong labor force. Abbot pointed us to a bureau chart showing each state’s share of workers earning minimum wage or less in 2012 — which showed, too, that Texas had far more workers in this dual category than the second-place state in this way, New York, which had 224,000 workers earning the minimum wage or less, equal to 6.3 percent of the nation’s workers in those pay categories. Nationally, Abbot said, some 75 million hourly workers accounted for 59 percent of all salaried and hourly paid workers. In Texas, the state’s 6 million hourly workers represented 57 percent of all wage and salary workers, she said. To our inquiry, Austin economist Stuart Greenfield agreed with Abbot’s analysis, though he pointed out by telephone that strictly speaking, according to the bureau chart, nearly two in 10 of the country’s minimum-wage workers lived in Texas. That is, Texans accounted for 282,000 of 1,566,000 U.S. workers paid the minimum wage, according to the chart, with 170,000 Texans paid less than the minimum wage. The Texas share of U.S. minimum-wage-only workers, 18 percent, far outpaced the No. 2 state in this category, Pennsylvania, which was home to nearly 6 percent of such workers, according to the chart. Also, Texas led other states with its 8.6 percent share of hourly U.S. workers paid below the minimum wage, though Florida landed a close second by having 8.3 percent of such hourly workers, the chart indicates. Our ruling Cutter said one of 10 minimum-wage workers in the U.S. lives in Texas. Actually, 18 percent of U.S. workers paid the minimum wage in 2012 toiled in Texas, according to government figures, while Texas was home to 13 percent of the nation’s hourly employees paid minimum wage or less. Since Cutter was arguing that Texas is not a land of plenty, the fact that she understated the state’s share of minimum-wage workers doesn’t short the Truth-O-Meter.

Perry claim about Texas workers makes assumption about wages paid to non-hourly workers
","Assailed for Texas leading the nation in minimum-wage workers, Gov. Rick Perry shot back a statistic we hadn’t heard before. Perry, engaging with Stephanie Cutter, the from-the-left co-host of CNN’s Crossfire, said on the Sept. 18, 2013, edition of the show: ""Ninety-five percent of all the wages in Texas are above minimum wage."" We’re in gravy, baby! But is that so? By email, Perry spokeswoman Lucy Nashed shared the calculations behind Perry’s statement. Nashed noted that according to the U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics, 452,000 Texas workers in 2012 earned the minimum wage or less, accounting for 7.5 percent of the state’s 6 million hourly workers over all. The Texas minimum wage equaled the federal minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. Nationwide, the bureau said, 4.7 percent of hourly workers earned the minimum wage or less. And those 452,000 minimum-wage Texas workers, Nashed said, accounted for 4.2 percent of the state’s total workforce, counting salaried workers and those paid on an hourly basis, of 10,879,800. The latter figure reflects the number of jobs held in Texas in 2012, according to the government’s payroll surveys. Nashed’s email continued: ""This would tell us that roughly 95.8% of all Texas workers earn at or above minimum wage. And since this is our own analysis of the data, we prefer to round down to 95% to be cautious."" By email, Cheryl Abbot, a Dallas-based bureau economist, did not quibble with the raw figures relied on by Perry. Then again, Abbot said by telephone that federal surveys of households and employers do not elicit detailed state wage data for employees paid by the week, the month or on other bases such as by the piece. Precisely, she said, the government’s household survey asks someone how much they’re paid only if the respondent says they are paid on an hourly basis. In 2012, Abbot said, the state’s 6 million hourly workers represented 57 percent of all wage and salary workers. So, what about the remaining workers? ""Because we don’t have detail on wage levels for the non-hourly (workers),"" Abbot said, ""I really can’t tell you if any of those people are paid above or below the minimum wage."" Still, she added, she assumes most non-hourly workers are paid more than the minimum wage. ""I’m not saying that ‘95 percent’ is out of the realm of reason,"" Abbot said, just that ""I can’t verify that."" By phone, University of Texas economist Daniel Hamermesh told us that Perry’s methodology seems reasonable, though he agreed that because the bureau has no wage information from non-hourly workers, he said, ""you can’t know for sure."" Another factor, Hamermesh speculated, is that workers who are not legally authorized to live here may be underrepresented in the survey results; neither they nor their employers are likely to reveal extremely low pay rates, he said. Separately, political scientist Doug Hall of the Washington, D.C.-based Economic Policy Institute said by phone that while the bureau figures largely support Perry’s statement, any assumption that this means nearly every Texan is reasonably paid--or that low-income Texans are doing particularly well--deserves scrutiny. For instance, Hall said, the lowest 10th percentile of Texas workers--meaning those who earned less than 90 percent of the workforce--were paid an average $7.84 an hour in 2012, according to U.S. Census Bureau survey results analyzed by the institute. That average wage for workers at the 10th percentile placed Texas third-lowest in the nation, besting Arkansas ($7.80 an hour) and Louisiana ($7.71), according to the institute. Hall noted that Texas ranked better in 2000 (7th) and 1990 (12th). (See the state-by-state breakdown here.) Our ruling Perry said 95 percent ""of all the wages in Texas are above minimum wage."" That conclusion ties to 452,000 of the state’s nearly 10.9 million workers in 2012 being paid the minimum wage or less. But those numbers are incomplete, because the federal agency that analyzes such data doesn’t gauge how much any non-hourly workers are paid. It seems reasonable to speculate that most non-hourly workers earn more than the minimum wage, but it’s not an across-the-board certainty. We rate this statement as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/20/rick-perry/perry-claim-about-nearly-all-texas-workers-earning/

Rick Perry says every engine maker is in Texas
","At a time when everyone wishes the country were producing jobs faster than it has been, Texas Gov. Rick Perry is happy to talk about the track record in his state. ""Thirty percent of all the jobs created in America were created in the state of Texas in the last ten years,"" Perry said on CNN’s Crossfire. Perry listed some of the firms located in Texas. ""Companies like Facebook, eBay, Apple -- which is soon to be one of the largest employers in the city of Austin -- Caterpillar,"" Perry said. ""Every engine manufacturer in the United States is now in the state of Texas."" That last part caught our ear. They say that everything is bigger in Texas, and the claim that every engine maker in the country now has an operation there seemed worth checking. We called Perry’s office for the evidence behind that statement, and they said he was referring only to Caterpillar. In 2008, the heavy equipment manufacturer announced plans to consolidate the engine work it had been doing in Illinois and South Carolina to a facility in Seguin, Texas. However, Perry's comments on Crossfire were about every engine maker in the country. The Texas Department of Economic Development and Tourism produced a report on the automotive industry in the state. From that we counted three engine makers, Caterpillar, AER Manufacturing, and Toshiba. A fourth one, Hilite, makes engine components in Carrollton, Texas. The U.S. Census Bureau has a survey of County Business Patterns for 2011 that includes tallies of the number of corporations in various industry categories. There are three industry codes that apply to the manufacture of engines for gasoline, diesel and aircraft engines. These codes cover the manufacture of engine parts and engines as a whole, so using them is a bit imprecise. Still, for firms with 20 or more employees, we found 386 nationwide. The figure for Texas is 17. That strongly suggests that there are many more engine makers in the country than there are in Texas. We also looked at firms that belong to the Truck and Engine Manufacturers Association and looked at where some of the larger companies had operations. Briggs and Stratton is a top engine maker with plants in Wisconsin, Missouri, Alabama, Georgia and Kentucky. But none in Texas. The story for John Deere is similar. John Deere makes its engines in Waterloo, Iowa. As far as Texas goes, it has a parts distribution center in Dallas. We did find that General Motors has a large presence in Arlington, Texas, although that is an assembly plant where parts made someplace else are put together. General Motors builds its engines in many states including Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. But not Texas. The jet engine company Pratt and Whitney has several facilities in Texas thanks to its work with military aircraft and the Air Force base in San Antonio, but those plants focus on maintenance and repair, not manufacturing. For engine assembly, Pratt and Whitney has plants in West Virginia and several locations in Canada. Our ruling Perry said every engine manufacturer is now in the state of Texas. Using a broad definition from the Census Bureau, we counted 17 firms in Texas that are involved with building engines. However, in that broad line of work , the total number of firms nationwide is well over 350. A sampling of some of the larger engine makers in the United States revealed some notable absences from Texas.

Martin O'Malley, Newt Gingrich face off over population statistics on ""Crossfire""
","EDITOR’S NOTE: We initially published our fact check of Gingrich’s comment on Sept. 20, 2013, with a rating of False. Soon after, CNN provided us with additional information. After we looked into their data, we rewrote and republished the story the same day, changing the rating to Half True. The original item has been archived here. A faceoff on CNN’s Crossfire between Texas Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, and Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley, a Democrat, produced a robust debate over how best to promote a state’s economic growth and quality of life. It also produced a blizzard of statistics with varying degrees of accuracy. One of the disputes focused on the two states’ population growth, with co-host Newt Gingrich suggesting that Texas was growing and Maryland shrinking because of their economic performance. Here’s the exchange: O’Malley: ""One of the key differences between our two states, Newt, is that our state was ranked among the top three in upward economic mobility. Texas was ranked among the worst states in terms of downward economic mobility."" Gingrich: ""Let me ask you this. As an objective fact, in the five years you've been governor, Texas has gained 440,000 people. According to the U.S. Census, Maryland has lost 20,000. Now, if we're having all this upward trajectory, why is Texas doing 22 times better in population migration over the last five years than Maryland?"" O’Malley: ""Actually, you need to check your facts. We've actually added 230,000 people. And we've actually grown by 4 percent. But that fact is dubiously put out by some blogs."" Gingrich: ""This is the U.S. Census."" We turned to the source Gingrich cited: the U.S. Census Bureau. The bureau not only counts the United States’ population every 10 years but also estimates population every year in between. We looked at the population estimates for the five-year period between 2007, the year O’Malley took office, and 2012, the most recent year available. Here’s the summary: Using these numbers, O’Malley is correct. Maryland didn’t lose 20,000 people in the past five years; as O’Malley correctly noted, Maryland gained just over 230,000 people during that period. O’Malley was also essentially correct about the percentage increase for Maryland -- 4.1 percent. Meanwhile, Texas didn’t gain 440,000 people over the past five years, as Gingrich had said. The Lone Star State actually gained many more -- upwards of 2.2 million new Texans over five years. However, Gingrich can also claim accuracy by looking at a different set of statistics. He can point to numbers for migration -- that is, the net change in people who moved into or out of a state from other states. This number, unlike the one O’Malley used, excludes births, deaths and foreign immigration. The Census figures show that between 2007 and 2012, Maryland has lost a net of 22,774 people. Over the same period, Texas has gained 423,273 people. That’s less than Gingrich had indicated, but all in all, it’s pretty close. Our ruling Gingrich said that since 2007, ""Texas has gained 440,000 people"" while ""Maryland has lost 20,000."" O’Malley countered that Maryland has added 230,000 people. Essentially, they’re both right -- they just used different measurements. O’Malley is right if you use overall population figures, while Gingrich is right if you look at migration from other states. We’ll split the difference and call this one Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e7b3a23e-187f-4d5d-b760-b22d0934aafb",/factchecks/2013/sep/20/newt-gingrich/martin-omalley-newt-gingrich-face-off/

Are there 400 crashes on the Interstate Bridge each year?
","The Columbia River Crossing -- the maybe-dead-maybe-not proposed bridge project to connect Oregon and Washington -- is nothing if not controversial. Even the folks who agree that it’s needed can’t agree on how to pay for it. In a recent newsletter to his constituents, Oregon Rep. Dennis Richardson argued against Democratic Gov. John Kitzhaber’s plan for Oregon to build the bridge on its own without a financial commitment from Washington. Richardson, a Republican, lists a number of reasons, ultimately concluding ""I do not approve of the Governor's plan to go forward with the CRC Project."" Even so, he mentions throughout the newsletter that there are several reasons a new bridge would be beneficial, calling it ""a much-needed infrastructure project."" As support, he notes the traffic accidents on the bridge. ""More than 400 car crashes occur each year on the current, congested Columbia River Bridge,"" he wrote. ""This exorbitant number of collisions results in broken cars, broken lives and broken hearts for hundreds of Oregonians and the families of those injured or killed in Columbia River Bridge traffic every year."" This caught us by surprise. Some quick mental math and you realize that means there would have to be at least one accident a day on the bridge. Now, PolitiFact Oregon knows it’s a busy bridge, but we haven’t seen an accident on our many trips to the Washougal River this summer, so we decided to see if he had his stats right. Richardson got back to us straight away and explained that he’d gotten his figures from a September 2012 briefing on the Columbia River Crossing. He emailed us a copy of the document and indeed, it noted that ""there are approximately 400 vehicle crashes per year in the CRC project area, making it one of the most accident-intensive sections of the corridor."" We were able to verify this figure through Dave Thompson, spokesman for the Oregon Department of Transportation. He pointed us to a passage in the Columbia River Crossing’s final environmental impact report, which noted that during the five-year period between Jan. 1, 2002, and Dec. 31, 2006, ""2,051 crashes were reported on mainline I-5 and its ramps within the CRC project area."" If you take that figure and divide it by five, you wind up with 409 crashes a year on average during that time period -- or about 1.12 per day. Here’s the rub, though. That figure isn’t just for the bridge, it’s for the entire project area, a considerably larger area, it turns out. Thompson told us, and we did a little Google Map work to back check him, that the project area is close to five miles long while the bridge itself is about 2/3 of a mile. Naturally, we wondered, then, how many accidents actually occurred on the bridge. That took a little longer, but Thompson was able to get an answer for us. Over the same five-year time period, 248 crashes happened on the Washington side of the bridge and 294 happened on the Oregon side. That’s a total of 542 -- or an average of 108 per year. There are some caveats for this data, too. These figures don’t include accidents on the ramps and they were collected using DMV and police report data, meaning they won’t include unreported accidents. Still, the number of crashes on the bridge itself seems to be about a quarter of the number in the project area, which is the number Richardson cited. When we called Richardson to get his take, he said the numbers were never presented in a very clear way. He pointed to the environmental impact statement and the way it describes crashes as having been ""reported on mainline I-5 and its ramps within the CRC project area."" ""I try my best to be honest and accurate,"" he said. Honestly, we agree, the data weren’t presented in the clearest of terms. And, to be fair, it’s not as though Richardson’s larger point about safety is completely invalid. There are an exceptional number of accidents occurring around the current Columbia bridge. According to the same environmental impact study, the crash rate in Washington’s project area is about 60 percent higher than it is on other similar highways, and in Oregon’s project area it’s about 50 percent higher. That said, Richardson wrote to constituents that ""more than 400 car crashes occur each year on the current, congested Columbia River Bridge."" That’s not even close. The statement is False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/20/dennis-richardson/are-there-400-crashes-interstate-bridge-each-year/

Nan Rich says Florida has long waiting lists for child care and care for the elderly
","Republican Gov. Rick Scott wants voters to give him ideas about what sort of taxes and fees to cut to save $500 million. Democratic challenger and former state Sen. Nan Rich, D-Weston, says Florida needs to talk about services to fund. ""We need to be taking a long hard look at funding the critical needs of the state,"" she said in a Sept. 11 blog in the Tampa Tribune. ""We’re 48th in K-12 funding and 50th in higher education, we have 75,000 on (a) waiting list for child care and 23,000 on waiting lists for CCE (in-home living assistance for the elderly). These are the middle class people we’re talking about."" In a related fact-check, we explored how Florida ranks in education funding. Here, we will examine the state’s waiting list for child care and Community Care for the Elderly. Child care waiting list  Rich was referring to Florida’s School Readiness Program, which provides subsidized day care for low-income parents so they can work. The program is funded with state and federal money, and families must pay a portion based on their income. To qualify, families must have a gross income no higher than 150 percent of the federal poverty guidelines. The programs are administered by early learning coalitions throughout the state. As of July 2013, the program served 222,817 children. ""This is about getting people from welfare to work and educating children and getting them ready for school,"" said Evelio Torres, president and CEO of the Early Learning Coalition of Miami-Dade/Monroe. In 2011-12, the statewide waiting list hit a monthly average of 74,691 -- just a few spots shy of the number cited by Rich. But it has since declined. In July 2013, there were 60,659 children on the waiting list. A chart of the waiting list over the past decade showed that it had a massive increase in 2008-09, reaching about 58,000. That grew to a peak of about 80,000 in 2009-10. Since then, it has been dropping. We talked to directors of organizations that oversee the child care programs in Broward and Miami-Dade, as well as the director of the state Office of Early Learning, to learn why the waiting list has fluctuated. They attributed it to ups and downs in the economy. All three officials warned there are several caveats about the waiting list. Sometimes a child care provider will send a blast email encouraging parents to sign up, and that can create a spike. Other times, an organization cleans up its waiting list, and the number declines. The list in every community isn’t maintained exactly the same way. And the names on the waiting list aren’t all eligible. ""It’s not until we screen and call families that we find out whether they are eligible,"" Torres said. ""A lot of times they are a dollar over income, and they can’t qualify, or not employed by the time you call them, and they don’t qualify. ... Unless you pour hundreds of millions of dollars into the system in Florida, you’re not going to eliminate the waiting list."" Barbara Weinstein, president of Family Central in Broward, suspects the need is greater than the waiting list, because some families get scared off by the high numbers on the list and don’t even bother to apply. The state received federal stimulus dollars to help supplement the program during the recession, but that has ended. This year the budget is $567 million, compared to $626 million a decade ago. Community Care for the Elderly Next, we’ll look at whether there are 23,000 on the waiting list for the Community Care for the Elderly program. The state-funded program provides in-home services for frail elders that can include meals, assistance with bathing, light housekeeping and transportation to the doctor. The purpose of the program is to avoid more costly nursing home care. The state’s Department of Elder Affairs sent us a chart showing that Florida’s waiting list hit about 23,000 in June 2011. But it has grown since then, and as of August 2013, the waiting list hit 28,604. The program served 13,790 seniors in 2012-13. Under Scott, funding increased by $1 million in 2012-13 and $3.75 million in 2013-14, said Office of Elder Affairs spokeswoman Ashley Marshall. Rich directed us to the Florida Council on Aging, which supplied us with data from the state showing that some clients enter the system through CCE but are later determined to be eligible for Medicaid or other programs. The Community Care for the Elderly is just one of many programs for seniors that have waiting lists. Our ruling Rich said in Florida ""we have 75,000 on (a) waiting list for child care and 23,000 on waiting lists"" for Community Care for the Elderly. Rich’s numbers on the waiting lists for child care and Community Care for the Elderly were about a year outdated. Her number overstated the child care waiting list by about 14,000 and understated the community care for the elderly waiting list by about 6,000, based on numbers from this summer. Still, her numbers track with recent averages. Both waiting lists require some further explanation: Everyone on the list may not be eligible for that particular program or could be moved into another program.

Math on sequester job cuts doesn't add up
","There has been a renewed focus on jobs and how many the economy has lost as Republicans and Democrats continue to do battle and threat of a government shutdown looms. Recently a political commentator took to Twitter highlighting job losses since across-the-board, automatic federal budget cuts -- known as sequestration -- took effect March 1. ""Since sequester began federal employment has been subtracting 6,000 to 7,000 jobs per month,"" the Political Line Twitter post said. If Political Line’s claim is correct, that would mean between 30,000 and 35,000 federal jobs have been lost for the five months, through August, that the sequester has been in effect. That type of possible job loss had us intrigued, so we decided to follow the numbers. PolitiFact Georgia emailed Political Line and visited its website for more information about the claim and about the author but received no response to our requests. Political Line is a political blog of postings on a variety of national topics from health care to drug policy, along with an aggregation of news stories. Under sequestration, the federal government will cut about $85 billion in spending by the end of the fiscal year, which ends Sept. 30. As a previous PolitiFact sequestration fact check noted, putting money into the economy does create jobs, and less money leads to fewer jobs in the short run. There have been numerous reports of the sequester’s impact, including departments limping along on tight budgets, employees forced to take unpaid furlough days and Head Start students being cut from the rolls. And this week, Washington, D.C., Mayor Vincent Gray blamed the horrific Navy Yard shooting on the sequester. When asked by CNN anchor Chris Cuomo how shooter Aaron Alexis, who was being treated for mental health issues, was still able to get access to areas that he probably shouldn’t have had, Gray responded: ""As I look at, for example, sequestration, which is about saving money in the federal government being spent, have we somehow skimped on what would be available for projects like this and then we put people at risk,"" Gray said on CNN’s ""New Day"" the morning after the shooting. Those accounts have provided anecdotal evidence about sequestration’s impact. But when it comes to the actual number of jobs lost to sequestration, we really just don’t know, said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow and federal budget policy expert at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning D.C. think tank. ""There isn’t anyone, including (the federal Office of Management and Budget), that has gone agency by agency and says what did you do, and how did you do it, and say how many jobs were lost,"" Lilly said. As for Political Line’s claim, with millions of federal employees, the 6,000-7,000 monthly job loss is statistically not a big thing, Lilly said. ""You could lose that many with just inaccurate or inconsistent reporting. It makes sense to me."" With no official analysis, numbers from multiple studies and financial reports have been used to detail sequester job cuts. In February, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that 750,000 more full-time jobs would be created in the U.S. economy by the end of the year without sequestration. A Goldman Sachs study, released this month, noted that the sequestration could end up costing another 100,000 federal jobs in the next few quarters, and that federal jobs have declined by 71,000 since last year. To get a more accurate count, we reviewed month-to-month federal government employment data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics from March 2013 (when sequestration began) through August, the most recent data available. Month All federal employees Month-to-month change Federal employees, minus postal workers Month-to-month change March 2,762,000 2,173,400    April 2,777,000 15,000 2,169,000 (4,400) May 2,757,000 (20,000) 2,168,200 (800) June 2,761,000 4,000 2,172,100 3,900 July 2,753,000 (8,000) 2,162,000 (10,100) August 2,752,000 1,000 2,162,100 (100) The BLS data showed that federal employment varied from month to month. Some months saw job losses exceeding Political Line’s claim of 6,000 to 7,000 jobs lost; but other months saw job gains. So what about Political Line’s claim? The political blogger said in a Twitter post that since sequestration, federal government jobs have decreased 6,000-7,000 jobs a month. There has been no official analysis of jobs lost to the sequester. There is anecdotal evidence that the budget cuts have hurt the federal sector, but at the same time, there have been job gains -- albeit marginal -- in the private sector. Using the best data available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the numbers show that some months federal job losses reached and exceeded Political Line’s claim, but in other months, the losses were much less, and there were even job gains. Political Line’s statement contains an element of truth, but it needs clarification and additional information. Reviewing the data over the previous 12 months does show an overall downward trend in federal government jobs, but the monthly totals fluctuate. And overall the job reduction is far less than the statement would indicate. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/20/political-line/math-sequester-job-cuts-doesnt-add/

Betsy McCaughey says on next doctor visit, ‘Obamacare will question your sex life’
","""Obamacare will question your sex life,"" says a New York Post headline this week. The opinion piece underneath, written by former lieutenant governor of New York Betsy McCaughey, author of Beating Obamacare, begins: ""‘Are you sexually active? If so, with one partner, multiple partners or same-sex partners?’ ""Be ready to answer those questions and more the next time you go to the doctor, whether it’s the dermatologist or the cardiologist and no matter if the questions are unrelated to why you’re seeking medical help. And you can thank the Obama health law."" McCaughey then claims that the law offers incentive payments, and eventually penalties, to pressure doctors and hospitals to convert to electronic health records. She quotes a cardiologist saying sex questions are ""insensitive, stupid and very intrusive"" and a nephrologist declaring that new requirements turn your medical record ""into an interrogation, and the data will not be confidential."" Readers sent us the op-ed and asked us to fact-check it. So does Obamacare require your dermatologist to ask you about your sex life? ‘Sex questions’ We talked with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, two members of a federal committee on health information technology, and the president of a national physicians group. We reached out to McCaughey and the two doctors she quoted, but we didn’t hear back. (The last time we rated a claim from McCaughey, it was her 2009 comment that the health care law would require mandatory counseling for Medicare patients ""that will tell them how to end their life sooner"" — a Pants on Fire falsehood.) Here’s what we learned. The federal government did create incentives and eventually penalties to encourage doctors and hospitals to make ""meaningful use"" of electronic health records. The government says the switch from paper will offer easier access to health records and data, provide reminders and alerts for doctors and patients, and reduce medical errors. The change wasn’t part of Obamacare, though. And it doesn’t require any ""sex questions"" — except for whether you’re male or female. You might hear the words, ""Are you sexually active?"" from your doctor, but it wouldn’t have anything to do with the health care law. In other words, McCaughey’s claim was utterly at odds with the evidence. ""Arrgghhh — now I have heard it all!"" said Molly Cooke, president of the American College of Physicians. Cooke, an internist, told PolitiFact that when she was in medical school in the 1970s, she was taught to ask: • Are you sexually active (with other people)? • If yes, are your partners men, women or both? • If no, is that out of choice, because you don’t currently have an appealing partner, because you have no privacy, or some other reason? • Are you happy with your sex life, however it is? ""My classmates and I were taught to ask all patients all four questions,"" she said. ""I am not saying that we always did it, but these questions are as old as the hills."" The rationale is that patients’ answers may reveal important information about their health, safety and well-being, she said. Her medical practice happens to focus on patients with HIV and other complex chronic illnesses. But let’s say some doctors, such as the cardiologist quoted by McCaughey, find such questions ""insensitive, stupid and very intrusive."" McCaughey wrote that the president’s ""reforms"" aim to ""turn doctors into government agents, pressuring them financially to ask questions they consider inappropriate and unnecessary."" Yet that cardiologist could earn government incentives for meaningful use of electronic health records whether he asked ""sex questions"" or not. ‘Electronic health records’ We looked at the specifications ourselves. The financial push toward electronic records came not from the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, commonly called Obamacare, but from the federal stimulus bill the year before — the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In the first stage of the incentives program, paid through the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, doctors must use electronic records to keep up with basics on their patients. They need to check for drug interactions, keep an up-to-date list of diagnoses, transmit prescriptions, keep medication and allergy lists, and record demographics and vital signs. They need to note preferred language, gender, race, ethnicity, date of birth, height, weight, blood pressure, body mass index, smoking status. The demographic information helps doctors catch disparities in care, said Paul Tang, an internist who chairs the workgroup on ""meaningful use"" for the health information technology committee created by the Recovery Act. Just as with paper records, that information is protected by federal health privacy laws, such as HIPAA, and in some cases additional state law. In the second stage, the requirements for doctors get more sophisticated, with provisions for electronic access for patients to their health information, ability to transmit data to immunization registries, and more. Some optional steps include entering electronic notes for at least 30 percent of the patients they see, and recording family health history as structured data. There’s a requirement to protect electronic health information. But there aren’t any requirements to ask questions about sexual history. That’s not to say they won’t be common: past medical history, family history and social history are fairly standard questions, and it would make sense for vendors of electronic health records systems to include them in their software. But if McCaughey’s cardiologist didn’t want to ask, he could still collect government money for using the records. What makes McCaughey’s claim even more bizarre is that it isn’t necessary to exaggerate concerns about electronic health records. There’s plenty of evidence-based debate about whether current privacy protections are enough in the new world of electronic records, and how to give patients a ""meaningful choice."" A New York Civil Liberties Union report she mentions says current regulations don’t give patients enough control over sensitive health information. A recent blog post at the website of the journal Health Affairs discusses how to earn patient trust and get meaningful consent for participation in health information exchange organizations. But the federal push toward electronic health records doesn’t require your doctor to grill you about your sex life. Our ruling McCaughey says in ""Obamacare will question your sex life"" that you can thank the president’s health law for questions about your sexual activity, even if your doctor finds them unnecessary. She suggests it’s part of Obamacare’s move toward electronic health records. But incentives for electronic health records were part of the Recovery Act, not Obamacare. And they don’t require participating doctors to ask questions about your sex life. McCaughey frames her concern for patient privacy with an evidence-free attack on Obamacare that veers toward the ridiculous. We call it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2013/sep/19/betsy-mccaughey/betsy-mccaughey-says-obamacare-will-question-your-/

Eleanor Holmes Norton says ""more guns than people"" in U.S., in Navy Yard reaction
","In the wake of Monday’s Navy Yard shooting, Eleanor Holmes Norton, D-D.C., addressed national and civic security. Holmes, the nonvoting delegate to Congress representing the District of Columbia, praised the quick police response, but she also noted that no one is entirely insulated from criminal acts. ""We understand that in an open and democratic and free society, you cannot make yourself impenetrable, especially when there are more guns than there are people in the United States today,"" she said in a press conference. Are there really more guns than people? We wanted to dig into the data. Let’s pin down the easy number: population. The U.S. Census Bureau puts the 2010 population at 308.7 million people. We can get even closer with their nifty population clock, which on the day we checked it estimated a population of nearly 317 million, based on migration, birth and death rates. Now that we have a frame of reference for Norton’s comparison, let’s move to the question of the number of civilian guns in the country, a murkier subject. As we’ve noted, federally sponsored gun research is scarce. Most of the available studies are estimates. Since most states don’t register guns or license owners, there’s no concrete thing to count, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. This June, at President Barack Obama’s request, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention released a report rounding up what we know about firearm ownership and usage. It offered a 2007 estimate of 294 million guns, but with a pretty hefty caveat: ""Basic information about gun possession, acquisition, and storage is lacking,"" the report read. ""No single database captures the total number, locations, and types of firearms and firearm owners in the United States."" The National Rifle Association usually describes the number as ""approaching 300 million,"" spokesman Andrew Arulanandam wrote in an email. Daniel van Hoogstraten, Norton’s spokesman, pointed us to a Congressional Research Service study that goes with a slightly higher ballpark: 310 million as of 2009. He made the case that gun proliferation in the country has been increasing at a quick enough rate to exceed the population. While that’s an interesting theory, we found no evidence to back it up. Since the CRS number is from 2009, the closest apples-to-apples comparison we can make is using the U.S. Census population from 2010. So that's about 310 million guns to 308.7 million people. Again, we can't get a firm grip on how much the guns number has changed since then, but the population has gone up by almost nine million, according to the Census estimate. Our ruling Norton claimed there are ""more guns than there are people in the United States."" There’s no way to know for sure how many guns there are, given the available data. The highest credible guns number we saw was 310 million, which bests the 2010 population by over a million. But it falls short of the 2013 population estimate. We don't have any reliable gun surveys to approximate 2013 numbers. There's a chance Norton is right, but the available evidence isn't definitive. We rate Norton’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/19/eleanor-holmes-norton/del-norton-says-more-guns-people-us-navy-yard-reac/
