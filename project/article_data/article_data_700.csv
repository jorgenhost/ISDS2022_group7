No, Calif. Program For Voters With Disabilities Not A ‘Security Concern’ As Larry Elder Suggested
","GOP recall candidate Larry Elder recently suggested — without evidence — that there are concerns about the security of a California voting program, one that helps people with disabilities cast their ballot.  On Aug. 19, the conservative talk show host tweeted a Washington Examiner article with the headline, ""California voters to be able to download ballots at home for recall election, sparking security concerns."" But election and disability rights experts say the claim Elder promoted is baseless. What’s more, the article he tweeted doesn’t cite anyone who raised concerns about the specific program.  Given the intense focus on election security, we set out on a fact check.  How Does The Program For Voters With Disabilities Work?  The article points to a California election program called Remote Accessible Vote-By-Mail, or RABVM. It’s designed to help people with disabilities, particularly those with vision and dexterity issues, vote privately and independently. Without the program, these voters often rely on others to help them read and fill out a ballot.  The system is also used by military and overseas voters. Certain counties have offered RABVM since 2017, while recent legislation required all counties to offer it starting in January 2020.  Registered voters must apply through their county elections office to take part. Once accepted, they receive a unique access code to download a ballot allowing them to read and mark it using their own assistive technology device, according to Jenna Dresner, spokesperson for the California Secretary of State’s Office, which oversees elections in the state.  The program does not allow voters to submit their ballot online, nor does it allow them to print out a blank ballot. Voters using RABVM must print out a single completed ballot and then return it in a vote-by-mail envelope or in-person. ""When [RABVM voters] log into the system with their unique credentials, they are temporarily disconnected from the Internet, so no votes can be submitted online or emailed,"" Dresner explained.  ""This IS NOT internet voting,"" reads a Disability Rights California blog post from July about the program.  Newsom, Democratic Lawmakers Expand RAVBM Program  Ahead of last year’s presidential election and again before this year’s recall, Democratic state lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom temporarily expanded the remote accessible voter program to allow all registered voters in California to participate.  Both times, they cited health concerns about voting in-person during the pandemic.  Last year, Newsom signed Assembly Bill 860 to require all counties send out vote-by-mail ballots. The bill also included a provision expanding RABVM.  This past June, state lawmakers included a provision in Senate Bill 152 to again temporarily expand the remote accessible voting program to allow all registered voters to use it after applying through their county elections office. Dresner said that decision was also made following health concerns about voting in-person. ""The elections official shall permit any voter to cast a ballot using a certified remote accessible vote by mail system, regardless of whether the voter is a voter with disabilities or a military or overseas voter,"" reads the legislation, which Gov. Gavin Newsom signed into law on June 28.  SB 152 temporarily changes portions of the state elections code in what a Sacramento Bee news article described as ""an effort to benefit Gov. Gavin Newsom,"" including speeding up the recall timeline. Republican state lawmakers opposed the bill, saying Democrats were ""changing the playing field,"" according to the article.  The bill would repeal the provisions, including the expansion of RABVM, on Jan. 1, 2022.  RABVM votes accounted for 0.14% of California’s total votes cast in the 2020 general election, or 24,248, according to figures from the Secretary of State’s Office. The total votes cast statewide was more than 17.7 million.  Election, Disability Rights Groups Say Program Not A Security Threat Kim Alexander, president of the advocacy group California Voter Foundation, said she is not aware of any security issues tied to the RAVBM program. ""People may have valid questions about it since it does use the Internet to deliver a ballot to a voter. But it does not use the Internet to return the ballot,"" Alexander wrote in an email. ""The voter must print out the RAVBM ballot after making his or her selections and then put it in a [vote-by-mail] envelope they have signed just like any other vote-by-mail ballot."" Paul Spencer, an attorney with Disability Rights California, who specializes in voting issues, said ""there aren’t security concerns."" Spencer said the same safeguards used to prevent fraud with traditional vote-by-mail ballots are used for RABVM. Voters, for example, are required to sign the outside of their ballot envelope. County elections officials then match that signature with the ones on file to verify each ballot.  ""They will also check that the person has not voted elsewhere and that this is their first ballot,"" Dresner, of the Secretary of State’s Office, added.  She said there’s no record of RAVBM sparking security concerns.  ""We are not aware of any investigations or prosecutions related to the use of the RAVBM system,"" Dresner said.  Elder’s campaign did not respond to a request for evidence. Our Ruling Republican recall candidate Larry Elder recently suggested, without evidence, that there are concerns about the security of a California voting program known as remote accessible vote-by-mail.  He also promoted the idea that some voters could download ballots. That part is correct, but needs context: RABVM allows people with disabilities along with military and overseas voters to download a ballot before submitting it by mail or in-person. State lawmakers and Gov. Gavin Newsom expanded the program each of the past two years to allow all registered voters to use it. A small fraction of voters used it in 2020. The second part of the tweet Elder shared, about security concerns, is just plain wrong. Election and disability rights experts, along with California’s Secretary of State’s Office, say there’s no evidence showing the program is a security risk. It is subject to the same fraud protections as California’s traditional vote-by-mail program.  Registered voters must apply to use it. Once approved, they use a unique access code to download, complete and print out their ballot. The ballot cannot be submitted online.  Voters are required to sign the outside of their ballot envelope. County elections officials then match that signature with the ones on file to verify each ballot.  Elder’s campaign did not respond to a request for evidence to support the claim about security concerns. The article he tweeted out doesn’t include anyone raising concerns about the remote voter program.  We rated the claim Elder tweeted out as Mostly False.  MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",/factchecks/2021/aug/27/larry-elder/no-calif-program-voters-disabilities-not-security-/

Viral TikTok falsely claims NATO took over U.S.’s largest naval base
","A TikTok video falsely claims that the ""Norfolk naval base has been taken by NATO,"" the alliance of countries primarily from Europe and North America. ""Apparently, the Norfolk naval base has been taken over by NATO because China and Russia are occupying the waters in the Atlantic Ocean,"" the speaker in the video says. ""We all know Russia, Putin, he hates Biden. Well, listen up, Putin. We hate Biden too. He’s not our president.""

That claim is inaccurate.  A screenshot of the Aug. 1 TikTok video falsely claiming NATO took over Naval Station Norfolk. ""It is false to say that Norfolk was ‘surrendered’ to NATO,"" a NATO official said in a statement to PolitiFact and other media organizations fact-checking similar social media claims.

A Defense Department spokesperson also told fact-checkers that the Pentagon still has the same capabilities at Naval Station Norfolk as it always has. NATO was established in 1949 and has since swelled to include the U.S. and 29 other member nations, according to its website. The U.S. was one of 12 founding members of NATO, and all decisions made by the alliance require consensus agreement among member nations. It is currently based in Brussels, Belgium. In July, NATO announced the full operational readiness and official launch of the Joint Force Command Norfolk, the first such headquarters in North America and the third around the world, along with similar regional commands in Brunssum, Netherlands, and Naples, Italy. ""It's the mission of this command to fight the battle of the Atlantic in the event of armed conflict,"" Gen. Mark Milley, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at the July 15 ceremony marking full operation of Joint Force Command Norfolk. The command was three years in the making, Milley said. The city of Norfolk unveiled welcome signs calling it ""NATO’s home in North America"" as early as 2018, PolitiFact found. But PolitiFact found no evidence that the recognition of the NATO joint command as an operation ready for battle means the alliance took over Naval Station Norfolk.

COVID-19 shot is mandated at White House, CDC and vaccine makers, contrary to a viral image
","A social media post circulating online purports to expose the hypocrisy of vaccination advocates by claiming that the White House, public-health agencies and vaccine manufacturers don’t require their workers to be vaccinated against COVID-19. The Aug. 19 Facebook post shows a screenshot of a tweet from a user named Mike Yoder.  The tweet is headlined ""List of employers NOT requiring their employees to get vaccinated,"" and then lists the White House, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the World Health Organization, Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson.

The screenshot also appeared on a separate Instagram post. It’s not clear whether the screenshot is of an authentic tweet from Yoder, a conservative lawyer who has tweeted skepticism of COVID-19 vaccines before. The tweet about employers does not appear on his page. In any case, the claim in the post is incorrect. All but one of the employers listed in the screenshot do have COVID-19 vaccine mandates for their workers. President Joe Biden announced on July 29 that all federal workers would have to verify their vaccination status. Unvaccinated workers are required to wear face coverings, distance themselves from other people and take weekly screening tests. The directive applies to all federal workers, including those at the White House, and at federal agencies like the CDC and FDA. Moderna said Aug. 19 that it would institute a vaccine mandate for all its U.S. workers starting Oct. 1. Requests for medical or religious exemptions will be considered case by case, the company said.    Pfizer announced on Aug. 4 that it would require all of its employees and contractors in the U.S. to get vaccinated against COVID-19 or take weekly screening tests. Johnson & Johnson will require all of its U.S.-based employees and contractors to be vaccinated by Oct. 4, with exemptions for people with medical or religious objections.  The only organization on the list that doesn't have a current or planned vaccine mandate for its workers is the WHO.  The Switzerland-based organization has workers in 150 countries, and doesn’t endorse a mandate. ""The World Health Organization does not presently support the direction of mandates for COVID-19 vaccination, having argued that it is better to work on information campaigns and making vaccines accessible,"" the organization said in April. A social media post claims the COVID-19 vaccine is not mandated for workers at the White House, the vaccine manufacturers and several health organizations. All but one of the organizations listed in the post have some form of COVID-19 vaccine requirement for their employees. In most cases, the mandates were announced before the post was published.

No consensus on the cost of ending homelessness in the US or halting global warming
","Some people on social media questioned why the world’s richest people aren’t sharing some of their wealth to help solve pressing global problems.  One Facebook post singled out climate change and homelessness, saying billionaires such as former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg could do more to end both. ""It would cost $20 billion to end homelessness in the U.S. Mike Bloomberg could do that tomorrow and still have $28 billion to his name,"" the post said. ""Halting global warming would cost $300 billion. The world’s 10 richest people could each throw in $30 billion and still have $386 billion themselves.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) For this fact-check, we wanted to look into the post’s claims about the cost of ending homelessness and halting global warming.  There’s no single number experts agree on that can capture the cost of ending homelessness or climate change. Both issues are complex. But our reporting found that the $20 billion to end homelessness and $300 billion to halt global warming would be far from sufficient.  The $20 billion figure to end homelessness has circulated for years. That number traces back to reporting about an outdated estimate from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development in 2012. It  was a rough estimate of the annual cost. The number has to do with housing choice vouchers, which are the primary component of federal spending on housing assistance. They are seen by advocates as one of the primary ways the government can address the homelessness crisis.  Under the housing choice voucher program, renters contribute 30% of their monthly income in rent and the federal government pays the rest, said Jason Ward, an economist and associate director for the RAND Center for Housing and Homelessness in Los Angeles. Not everyone who is eligible for housing assistance receives it. Ward estimated that around 7.4 million eligible households are not receiving this aid. Expanding the voucher program to cover all those who are eligible would cost well over $20 billion. The average subsidy per voucher holder is around $8,000 a year. Multiply that by 7.4 million, and it would cost at least $59 billion per year to fully fund the voucher program. The government would still need to substantially increase the supply of affordable housing so that the use of vouchers would not reduce the housing supply and raise rents.  Current estimates of the costs of building affordable housing in major metropolitan areas range from around $150,000 per unit in Atlanta to a high of $550,000 per unit in Southern California. Constructing more than 3.5 million new units — Ward’s estimate for the affordable housing units needed to fill the voucher shortfall — could cost $1.3 trillion, Ward said.  ""These estimates still also ignore the costs of providing the significant service needs of many individuals currently experiencing chronic homelessness, which include intensive mental health services and health care treatment/management for a variety of chronic health conditions, as well as substance abuse treatment for the large portion of the chronically homeless population struggling with addiction,"" Ward said. The claim that $300 billion can halt global warming appears to be rooted in a 2019 Bloomberg column. The piece says that $300 billion is enough to lock millions of tons of carbon emissions back into the soil.  That article’s authors cite René Castro Salazar, an assistant director general at the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. Salazar told Bloomberg that almost 5 billion acres of degraded land could be restored to pasture, in effect reversing desertification trends and converting enough carbon into biomass to stabilize carbon emissions for 15 to 20 years — giving the world a chance to adopt longer-term sustainable technologies.  Capturing carbon by restoring lands that have been degraded by misuse, deforestation or overgrazing is one of the strategies scientists have identified to mitigate environmental distress and disaster.  The Bloomberg column focused on this one strategy. A 2019 Slate column pointed out that while a hypothetical soil restoration strategy might be technically sound, addressing climate change comes with major political roadblocks, making actual costs much higher.  Experts themselves disagree on how much it would cost the world to halt the catastrophic consequences of global warming — but $300 billion falls well short of most estimates.  Yvo de Boer, the former executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, estimated that reducing greenhouse gas emissions and adapting to climate change would require $300 billion a year from 2020 onward. A major report from the U.N.’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change said that limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius would require an annual average investment of around $2.4 trillion from 2016 to 2035, or around $48 trillion.  In a 2020 review, climate research group Project Drawdown estimated that deploying the technologies and changes necessary to meet the climate targets set by the Paris Agreement would cost the world about $25 trillion.  A paper published in the scientific journal Nature posited a model to estimate the cumulative costs of achieving climate policy targets. Estimates ranged from $10 trillion to $100 trillion, with median estimates falling between $15 trillion and $30 trillion. A report by the Paris-based International Energy Agency in 2020 suggested that reaching global net zero emissions by 2050 would cost $5 trillion in clean energy investments.  The wide range of cost estimates puzzles lawmakers and researchers, said a group of MIT scientists working on the issue. For one thing, it’s hard to accurately gauge the price of various technologies that have not yet been fully developed. Models for estimating cost often do not account for possible public resistance, limited resources and lack of international cooperation.  A Facebook post claimed that it would cost $20 billion to end homelessness in the U.S. and $300 billion to halt global warming.  These issues are complex, and there are no firm estimates of the cost of addressing them. That said, expert analysis suggests that $20 billion falls short of the actual cost to end homelessness in the U.S. Similarly, while cost models for meeting climate change targets differ widely, $300 billion is much lower — sometimes by a hundredfold— than other estimates posited by experts.  We rate this claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/aug/27/facebook-posts/no-consensus-cost-ending-homelessness-us-or-haltin/

No, cancer and heart disease deaths didn’t disappear during the pandemic

Breast cancer was the most common new case that year, followed by lung cancer, and colon and rectum cancer. This statistic also appears in a February cancer journal article about cancer mortality in 2020.  
According to the National Cancer Institute, the federal government’s main agency for cancer research, cancer is the leading cause of death across the globe. By 2040, the number of new cases is expected to rise to 29.5 million each year, and the number of cancer-related deaths to 16.4 million.  The agency’s most recent annual report, published in 2021, only looks at data up to the year 2018. But overall, cancer death rates in the United States decreased 2.2% per year on average among adult men and 1.7% per year among women.  The American Cancer Society estimates that in 2021 there will be more than 608,000 cancer deaths. There’s an important caveat: that estimate doesn’t account for the effect the COVID-19 pandemic ""has likely had on cancer diagnoses and deaths,"" because the projections are based on reported cases and deaths through 2017 and 2018. In England, according to an August 2020 Lancet article about how the pandemic could affect cancer deaths, ""substantial increases"" in the number of avoidable deaths ""are to be expected"" thanks to people delaying medical care that could have identified and led to cancer treatments for patients sooner.  As for heart disease, it’s the leading cause of death for men, women and people of most racial and ethnic groups in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 655,000 Americans die of it each year.  COVID-19, meanwhile, was the third most common cause of death in the United States in 2020, according to provisional mortality data from the National Vital Statistics System.

Fact-checking a claim about the FDA’s role in approving pesticides in food
","After the U.S. Food and Drug Administration gave final approval to the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine, a health and wellness Facebook group shared a post that seeks to discredit the agency. ""FDA approval means nothing when you realize the FDA also approves pesticides in our food!"" the Aug. 23 post said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post implies that since the FDA allows pesticides in food, people shouldn’t trust the agency’s approval of the Pfizer vaccine. But that misrepresents the role of the FDA in regulating pesticides, and ignores the scientific processes that go into vaccine approval decisions. The post uses a misleading claim about pesticide regulation to argue that FDA approval means nothing. That’s not the case. Full approval by the FDA means that the agency has high confidence in the safety, effectiveness and quality of a drug. On Aug. 23, the FDA approved the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine for people 16 and older. The vaccine was previously used under emergency use authorization, a designation that still applies for people between 12 and 15. ""While this and other vaccines have met the FDA’s rigorous, scientific standards for emergency use authorization, as the first FDA-approved COVID-19 vaccine, the public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product,"" acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in a press release. Although the COVID-19 vaccines were already deemed safe and effective with the emergency use authorization, full approval means that businesses and schools may have more leeway to require the Pfizer vaccine, and the shot can stay on the market beyond the health emergency. The FDA says the approval process includes an analysis of the condition and available treatments, assessment of benefits and risks through manufacturer-provided data, and strategies for managing risks associated with the drug. The road to FDA approval starts with a vaccine undergoing three different phases of clinical trials, according to University of Chicago Medicine. Each phase of the trial increases the number of participants and the scope of what researchers look for. Vaccine manufacturers then have to submit a Biologics License Application to the FDA, which includes data from clinical and non-clinical trials, technical information, labeling information, and more. In Pfizer’s case, this application built upon the extensive data submitted to support its emergency use authorization. Pfizer submitted its application for full FDA approval in May 2021, and it was the fastest FDA approval of a vaccine ever. ""The public and medical community can be confident that although we approved this vaccine expeditiously, it was fully in keeping with our existing high standards for vaccines in the U.S.,"" said Peter Marks, the director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. Regulation of pesticides in the food supply is shared between the Environmental Protection Agency and the FDA. The regulations concern the safety of the pesticides used in growing food, and how much pesticide residue can remain on food without causing harm. This residue is often measured in parts per million. Simply put, the EPA sets the allowable limits on pesticide residue that would be safe for human consumption, and the FDA is responsible for enforcing these limits. The limits apply to food that’s imported or grown in the U.S. In setting the limits, the EPA examines factors such as the pesticide’s toxicity, how much growers apply and how it breaks down. One way the FDA enforces these limits is through its Pesticide Residue Monitoring Program, which tests a variety of food samples every year to see whether they meet federal guidelines for over 800 pesticides and chemicals. ""Very small amounts of pesticides that may remain in or on fruits, vegetables, grains, and other foods decrease considerably as crops are harvested, transported, exposed to light, washed, prepared and cooked,"" EPA spokesperson Tim Carroll said. ""The EPA agrees with experts who recommend consuming a varied diet that includes many fruits and vegetables, and washing them first with plain water to remove dirt, bacteria and pesticide residues."" Under law, the EPA is also required to reevaluate the safety of existing pesticides, although that doesn’t mean the agency isn’t subject to political and industry pressures. In 2017, then-EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt rejected the agency’s recommendation to ban using chlorpyrifos on food, a pesticide linked to neurological damage in children. This year, the EPA reversed the decision and announced that it would ban the pesticide, but it will take time to phase out its use on food completely. A Facebook post claimed that ""FDA approval means nothing when you realize the FDA also approves pesticides in our food!"" The FDA does not approve pesticides in food. The EPA sets limits for safe levels of pesticide residue on food, and the FDA monitors the food supply to enforce the limits. The FDA’s approval process for vaccines begins with three phases of clinical trials to establish their safety and efficacy, and a review of data from clinical and non-clinical trials along with other supporting documentation.

No, COVID surge can't be pinned on the Black population
"," Republican Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, asked last week to defend the Texas response to surging coronavirus cases, blamed Democrats for the present COVID-19 wave, specifically African Americans, who he said are reliable Democratic voters. ""The COVID is spreading, particularly, most of the numbers are with the unvaccinated, and the Democrats like to blame Republicans on that,"" Patrick told Fox News host Laura Ingraham. ""Well the biggest group in most states are African Americans who have not been vaccinated. The last time I checked over 90% of them vote for Democrats.""  Backlash came from both sides of the aisle. Patrick’s liberal critics called his comments racist. Allen West, a Black Republican gubernatorial candidate and former head of Texas GOP, called the remark ""unconscionable, utterly disturbing, and highly insulting,"" then acknowledged that he had not been vaccinated.  A day later, Patrick revised his statement by saying on Facebook that he was referring to vaccination rates, not the overall number of unvaccinated Black people.  ""Not surprisingly, Democrat social media trolls were up late misstating the facts and fanning the flames of their lies,"" Patrick’s statement read. ""Federal and State data clearly indicate that Black vaccination rates are significantly lower than White or Hispanic rates.""  And in a statement to PolitiFact, Patrick’s spokesperson said that the lieutenant governor was ""clearly discussing vaccination rates.""  ""Obviously, he knows that African Americans do not make up a majority of the population in Texas,"" spokesperson Steve Aranyi said. ""According to CDC data and several other sources, when comparing vaccination rates in Texas and several other states, the African American community has the lowest rate of vaccination when compared to Latinos, whites, and Asians. The Texas and nationwide data is crystal clear.""  When asked if Patrick might have misspoken, Aranyi said, ""The lieutenant governor understands that some people might have heard it that way, but he believes his words were very clear. He was referring to vaccination rates."" There's a clear difference between what Patrick said on Fox News, that African Americans are the ""biggest group"" of unvaccinated people, and what he said in response to backlash, that Black populations have the lowest rates of vaccination. And the two statements land on opposite sides of the true-false spectrum.  Regardless of whether or not he was referring to vaccination rates, he did not seek to change his main point, that Black populations are playing a major role in fueling the present COVID-19 surge. But there’s no evidence to support that.   It’s also not the first time Patrick has targeted Texas’ Black population. In April, during debates over a provision of a Texas voting bill that eliminated drive-thru voting centers, Patrick argued that most people of color don’t own cars. PolitiFact rated that False.  Patrick said on Fox News that in ""most states,"" Black people are the largest racial group of unvaccinated people. But that’s not the case in Texas or elsewhere.   In Texas, 44% of residents who are eligible for the vaccine are unvaccinated — about 10.7 million people. According to vaccination data from the Texas Department of State Health Services, white people make up the largest portion of this total. About 6.2 million white people are unvaccinated, or roughly 53% of the eligible unvaccinated Texans.   Hispanics make up the second-largest group with 4.7 million people, 44% of eligible unvaccinated Texans, followed by Blacks with 1.8 million people, about 17%, and Asians with 364,000 people, less than 4%.  The same is true for the nation at large as well. According to the Kaiser Family Foundation, 57% of unvaccinated people in America are white, while 20% are Hispanic and 13% are Black.   Although neither the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention nor the U.S. Census Bureau publishes data showing vaccination rates by race and ethnicity in individual states, we can look to states with sizable Black populations in search of any places where Black people might make up the largest unvaccinated group.    In Georgia, for instance, white people make up the largest racial group of unvaccinated, followed by Hispanics, Blacks, and Asians, according to state data and Census estimates. The same goes for Arkansas, where the number of unvaccinated white people almost doubles that of the state’s unvaccinated Black population.  After the online backlash, Patrick said he was referring to vaccination rates. In Texas, 35% of Black people eligible for the vaccine are fully vaccinated. Rates for white and Hispanic populations both hover around 46% to 47%, and Asian populations are the most vaccinated at 70%, according to state data. These rankings are the same in most states, according to Bloomberg’s weekly vaccine tracker, which compiles racial data from each state to analyze vaccination equity. The tracker shows that, in most states, Black, Hispanic and Latino populations are getting vaccinated at a lower rate than their share of the population, while the opposite is true for Asian and white populations.  The same is true from a nationwide perspective. According to CDC data, Asian people are the most fully vaccinated racial group in America followed by white people and Hispanic and Latino populations. Black populations are the least vaccinated group.   There’s no evidence that lagging vaccination rates in minority communities are a result of Democratic ideology. Rather, these results are due to differences in vaccine access among racial groups, although these disparities are shrinking as efforts are made to vaccinate these hard-to-reach communities, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation report.  It’s also unreasonable to suggest that any one racial or ethnic group is responsible for the present COVID-19 surge fueled by the Delta variant, said Estelle Willie, director of health policy and communications at the Rockefeller Foundation. Texas’ Black residents make up just 13% of the state’s population, according to census data. And although vaccinations in the Black community lag behind other racial groups, Black residents make up just 15% of the state’s total present number of cases, state data shows.  According to Kaiser Foundation, the U.S.’s remaining population of unvaccinated people tend to be younger, less educated, and Republican. And among people who are the most opposed to vaccines, those who say they will ""definitely not"" get a vaccine, 65% of them are white.  In Texas, for instance, the counties with the 10 lowest percentages of fully vaccinated people, each under 30%, also lean heavily Republican, with at least 80% of the votes cast in those counties going to former President Donald Trump in the November election. ""Clearly the overwhelming vaccine hesitant group in the country tend to come from conservative groups,"" said Dr. Peter Hotez, co-director of the Center for Vaccine Development at Texas Children’s Hospital and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. ""We’ve got to figure out a way to fix it, because the bar to vaccinate our way out of this epidemic is really high. We really need 80-85% of the country vaccinated. Not just the adults, but the entire country,"" Hotez said. ""The partisanship is really hurting the country now."" Many Black communities were already experiencing health disparities before the pandemic struck, and the necessity for COVID-19 testing and vaccines have amplified those disparities in the COVID-era, said Maureen Johnson-León, a data equity specialist at the University of Texas Covid-19 Modeling Consortium.   ""I think it's fair to say that many of the health disparities and racial disparities that existed before COVID-19 have been amplified by COVID-19 and access to vaccines, testing and other interventions,"" Johnson-León said.   Access to reliable transportation, affordable health care or a trusted doctor also are major barriers to vaccines, experts said. ""Why might someone not yet have been vaccinated? We can wonder if somebody doesn't have access to a car. Have they had equal access to a vaccine as another family with a car?"" Johnson-León explained. ""For any of these kinds of measures or categories, we can begin to frame the vaccine equity issue as, what can we do in a pandemic response to get vaccines to the communities that have been most vulnerable?"" State leaders also have limited local vaccination efforts in areas with high populations of people of color. State health officials threatened to withhold vaccine doses to Dallas County because a local plan was targeting vaccinations in ZIP Codes with predominantly Black and Latino residents. County officials scrapped the plan to keep vaccine allocation levels intact. ""What's been critical to our approach has been our ability to be hyper-focused on specific communities' needs, and listening and responding in ways that public health officials haven't been able to so far,"" said Aurora Harris, Southern Director for Young Invincibles, a group that works to overcome healthcare barriers in Houston’s communities of color. ""We're filling in those gaps — that's the strategy.""  In an attempt to blame vaccine hesitancy on Democrats, Patrick said on Fox News that the biggest group of unvaccinated people in most states is African Americans. He later clarified his statement, saying that he was referring to vaccination rates, not total populations.   His on-air statement is wrong. Black people aren’t the largest group of unvaccinated people in any state. But his revised statement, that vaccination rates among the Black population lag behind that of other racial groups, is correct.   Nonetheless, Patrick’s underlying claim — that Black communities are driving the current surge — is not supported by evidence. We rate this claim False. ",/factchecks/2021/aug/26/dan-patrick/no-you-cant-tie-present-covid-surge-black-populati/

Fact-checking Joe Biden on U.S. credibility as military withdraws from Afghanistan
","Under fire over the plight of Afghans and Americans trying to flee Taliban-controlled Afghanistan, President Joe Biden has defended the U.S. military’s withdrawal and pushed back against assertions that U.S. credibility is damaged. On Aug. 20, a reporter asked Biden: ""What is your message to America’s partners around the world who have criticized not the withdrawal, but the conduct of that withdrawal and made them question America’s credibility on the world stage?"" Biden replied: ""I have seen no question of our credibility from our allies around the world. I've spoken with our NATO allies. … The fact of the matter is I have not seen that. As a matter of fact, the exact opposite I've gotten. The exact opposite thing is we're acting with dispatch. We're committing to what we said we would do."" We can’t fact-check what Biden has seen, but we wondered if his main point is accurate: Is it true that no allies have questioned U.S. credibility in light of the chaos in Afghanistan? Biden’s claim is partly right, but leaves out important details. PolitiFact looked through statements on Afghanistan issued by leaders of NATO members, including those that an expert said contributed most to the International Security Assistance Force mission in the country: Germany, the United Kingdom, Italy and France. The current leaders of those four NATO members have not publicly condemned the U.S. response or questioned its credibility. But some members of foreign governments have challenged the U.S. and NATO on the withdrawal and said that outcomes in Afghanistan weakened the West. And a day after Biden’s claim, former British Prime Minister Tony Blair, an ardent defender of U.S. interventions in Iraq and Afghanistan, wrote: ""The world is now uncertain of where the West stands because it is so obvious that the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan in this way was driven not by grand strategy but by politics."" The White House press office did not comment on the record for this fact-check. On-the-ground reporting has shown chaotic scenes in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, as people try to leave the country, fearing Taliban reprisals against those who worked with allied forces and the U.S.-backed government. The U.S. and other countries have scrambled to arrange evacuation flights on military and commercial planes. The U.S.’ withdrawal came after nearly two decades of war against the Taliban, which ruled in Kabul from 1996 to 2001 and harbored al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden, who planned the 9/11 terrorist attacks against the U.S.  A coalition of U.S. and allied forces drove out the Taliban in 2001, but the group swiftly regained power in Afghanistan as U.S. troops began withdrawing from the country under the February 2020 agreement between the Taliban and the Trump administration.    When examining the reaction among allies, the most relevant ones to focus on are the biggest NATO contributors to the mission in Afghanistan, said Teresa Eder, a program associate at the Global Europe Program at the Wilson Center.  ""Obviously, we have not heard from prime ministers, chancellors, or presidents openly questioning the way this withdrawal was and is being conducted,"" Eder said. But some members of parliament from governing parties, and not just opposition leaders, have spoken up. The criticism hasn’t been targeted just at the United States. Some criticism has also been aimed at NATO and the West in general. The scope also has varied: Some have criticized the decision to withdraw from Afghanistan, others have condemned the aftermath, and others have broadly said the outcome in Afghanistan was a failure and proposed re-examining their own approaches to foreign policy. In their criticism, some have referenced their own governments’ accountability. Eder said there is ""some weight"" to comments from Norbert Röttgen, chairman of the foreign affairs committee in Germany’s national parliament and a member of Chancellor Angela Merkel’s ruling party. ""I say this with a heavy heart and with horror over what is happening, but the early withdrawal was a serious and far-reaching miscalculation by the current administration,"" said Röttgen, according to Politico. ""This does fundamental damage to the political and moral credibility of the West."" On Aug. 15, the day the Afghan president fled the country and Taliban fighters entered Kabul, Röttgen tweeted in German: ""Today is an immeasurable catastrophe. It is the result of the fatal wrong decision by the U.S. to rush to leave Afghanistan & our inactivity following this decision. A failure of the West with dramatic consequences for (Afghanistan) & our credibility."" On Aug. 18, Röttgen also tweeted that German and European Union foreign policy can no longer consist of ""just trailing behind the Americans."" Tom Tugendhat, the Conservative chair of the U.K. Parliament’s foreign affairs committee, tweeted: ""Afghanistan is the biggest foreign policy disaster since Suez. We need to think again about how we handle friends, who matters and how we defend our interests. In Kabul we’ve failed our friends and ourselves. We need to think again, fast."" In a speech, Tugendhat also called for ""reinvigorating our European NATO partners to make sure that we are not dependent on a single ally, on the decision of a single leader."" Tobias Ellwood, who chairs the defense committee in the British Parliament, has questioned the sincerity of Biden’s foreign policy messaging. ""People are bewildered that after two decades of this big, high-tech power intervening, they are withdrawing and effectively handing the country back to the people we went in to defeat,"" Ellwood told the Washington Post. ""This is the irony. How can you say America is back when we're being defeated by an insurgency armed with no more than (rocket-propelled grenades), land mines and AK-47s?"" Latvia’s defense minister, Artis Pabriks, said in a radio interview that ""this kind of troop withdrawal caused chaos,"" and that ""unfortunately, the West, and Europe in particular, are showing they are weaker globally,"" the Post reported. Josep Borrell, the European Union’s foreign policy chief, called the developments a ""catastrophe for the Afghan people, for the Western values and credibility and for the developing of international relations."" Among current leaders of NATO countries, Czech President Milos Zeman took direct aim at the U.S. ""I think that by leaving Afghanistan, the Americans have lost the prestige of a global leader and NATO itself has raised doubts about the legitimacy of its existence,"" Zeman said, according to a Times of India report that cited Czech media. Public statements from Merkel, U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, French President Emmanuel Macron and Italy’s prime minister Mario Draghi have emphasized the need to evacuate from Afghanistan their citizens and Afghans who have helped the allied mission, as well as a commitment to the protection of human rights and freedoms in Afghanistan. After the Taliban seized power in Afghanistan, Merkel said the developments were ""bitter, dramatic and appalling, especially for the people in Afghanistan."" She also praised international cooperation on evacuations and said that the ""allies and of course the Federal Armed Forces along with numerous civilian organisations had accomplished an enormous amount."" Foreign policy experts told us that it’s important to put some of the criticism in context. There may be a political agenda behind them, or an effort to protect a leader’s legacy, said Sara Bjerg Moller, an assistant professor at the School of Diplomacy and International Relations at Seton Hall University. In Germany, for example, ruling-party leader Armin Laschet, who called the allied withdrawal a ""debacle,"" is running in a close election to succeed Merkel as chancellor, Moller noted. In Europe, ""politicians are having to answer to their own publics about the role their governments played in Afghanistan over the years,"" Moller said, ""as well as trying to head off criticism regarding ​challenges they are facing getting their own people and ​local partners out by shifting attention and blaming Washington."" Zeman’s comments are primarily geared toward a domestic audience and ""have no larger consequences for NATO or the United States,"" Eder said. Zeman, who is head of state, but not head of government, is known for his Russian-friendly stance, experts said. NATO allies have known about the U.S. withdrawal, and many got their own forces out in advance, precisely because they knew Biden's timetable, Moller said. ""Telling the media now they are shaken by Biden's withdrawal timetable and would have preferred to maintain the status quo — which wasn't a status quo — is hypocrisy at best and a bald face lie, at worst,"" Moller said. Some members of foreign governments who are speaking out may be using the moment to push for concessions from the United States in future policy discussions, said Joshua Shifrinson, an associate professor of international relations at Boston University. ""The fact that we haven’t seen the castigation of U.S. credibility in an overt, dramatic way is a more telling indicator,"" said Shifrinson. Experts said that the U.S. withdrawal in Afghanistan and ensuing events aren’t being interpreted as an indicator that the U.S. won’t live up to its commitments to allies, such as collective defense obligations under NATO principles. ""I think we can certainly say that we overrated the U.S. planning to withdraw from Afghanistan in an orderly fashion,"" Eder said, ""but I don’t think we can draw any larger conclusions from this and say the United States would not come to the aid of NATO allies in the event of a Russian military attack."" Said Moller: ""I am dubious of the claim that the U.S. departure from Afghanistan has shaken our allies' confidence about U.S. security guarantees elsewhere in the world."" European leaders have emphasized that they want to continue coordinating and working with the United States on evacuations, humanitarian issues and the future stability of the region, Eder said. She said that European leaders also have an interest in waiting to see how things unfold over the next several weeks rather than risking upsetting trans-Atlantic ties on another front. ""Some analysts argue that far from diminishing U.S. credibility, the withdrawal from Afghanistan will free up U.S. resources and capabilities that could enhance deterrence vis-à-vis Russia or China,"" Eder said. NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg on Aug. 20 said that ""NATO remains a strong alliance"" and that North America and Europe must continue to stand together. ""The unfolding events in Afghanistan do not change this,"" Stoltenberg said. ""The shifting global balance of power, Russia’s aggressive actions, and the rise of China, make it even more important that we keep a strong trans-Atlantic bond."" Biden said there has been ""no question of our credibility from our allies around the world"" regarding how the U.S. is withdrawing from Afghanistan. Some foreign officials have challenged the U.S. and NATO on the withdrawal from Afghanistan and how it was executed. But experts said that the top leaders of NATO members that most contributed to the NATO mission in Afghanistan have not publicly questioned U.S. credibility. We did not find such criticism from those leaders, either. We rate Biden’s claim Half True. RELATED: ​​Ask PolitiFact: What are some basic facts on the U.S. war in Afghanistan?

Proximity monitors at Wash. school are for vaccinated students and staff, too
","The start of the school year has been engulfed in controversy around COVID-19 safety measures, such as mask requirements for students and vaccination mandates for staff. At one Washington state high school, safety measures for student athletes have become fodder for viral social media posts. On Aug. 24, a Facebook page called ""Hold the Line"" shared a screenshot of a headline claiming that unvaccinated student athletes at Eatonville High School, about 50 miles south of Seattle, were made to wear proximity monitors. The headline read: ""EXCLUSIVE: Washington public school forces unvaccinated teens to wear ankle monitors,"" and continues, ""A 15-year-old girl was allegedly forced to wear an ankle tracking monitor for volleyball practice at Eatonville High School in Washington state as a condition of participating in team sports."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The school is using proximity monitors for student athletes as a COVID-19 precaution,  but the headline spotlighted in the post, with references to ""unvaccinated teens"" being ""allegedly forced,"" leaves out some important context: The requirement applies to students and staff — whether or not they’re vaccinated — and only while they’re participating in the sport. The article that appeared with the headline, published by the conservative Canadian publication Post Millennial, has also been picked up by several other online news outlets, and has led some users to compare the devices to ankle monitors designed for people who are incarcerated or on parole. The Post Millennial article claimed that a 15-year-old girl was told by her coach to put on an ankle tracking monitor for volleyball practice as part of a program designed for efficient contact tracing to prevent COVID-19 spread.  According to Post Millennial, the device — called TraceTag — would be used to maintain social distancing guidelines by notifying wearers when they are too close to someone else and passively collecting interaction records for contact tracing should someone test positive for COVID-19 later on. The article’s headline was later changed to ""EXCLUSIVE: Washington public school forces student athletes to wear ankle monitors for purposes of COVID segregation: parents."" PolitiFact was not able to identify the student mentioned in the article, but a press release from Eatonville School District clarified the policy: Proximity monitors are being used for ""high contact and moderate indoor contact sports."" ""The proximity monitor contains radio-based sensors that track distance between individuals wearing the device, as well as length of time spent in proximity to one another,"" a school athletics FAQ webpage explained.  The monitors were purchased with grants to support athletic programs.  Administrators and coaches invited parents to a meeting and gave them a consent form prior to the start of the fall athletics season, but the school also suggested that ""numerous changes"" to the system can be expected throughout the year.  The school’s fall athletics season began on Aug. 23. The FAQ page said the school decided to use proximity monitors to keep track of contacts so that athletes and coaches would not have to quarantine unnecessarily.  ""If a student or coach tests positive, we will have immediate information regarding athletes’ and coaches’ contacts, so we can more tightly determine who might need to quarantine,"" Gary Neal, the superintendent of Eatonville School District, explained. The TraceTag device, made by the workplace technology firm Triax, is not a location tracker like the kind used in corrections settings. The small device, which can be clipped to a hat or strapped to the body, has two functions: It emits an audible alert when people are within six feet apart, and records that information passively. That data, which can be anonymized, can subsequently be connected to a dashboard for an administrator to review. TraceTag doesn’t track location or movements, the company explained, but rather records interactions between two like devices.  A headline shared on Facebook says a high school in Washington state is forcing unvaccinated student athletes to wear ankle monitors to play indoor sports. The school is making staff and students, whether or not they are vaccinated, wear proximity monitoring devices while they are participating in high to moderate-contact indoor sports, as a COVID-19 safety measure to aid social distancing and contact tracing. The devices do not track location. The headline leaves out key context from the article, and leaves the impression that the requirement applies only to unvaccinated students.

No, doctors in South Florida did not walk off the job or protest while patients needed care
","It’s no secret that Florida is in the middle of its most serious outbreak of the pandemic. The state is averaging around 150,000 new COVID-19 cases per week as of mid-August, and nearly 16,900 people in the state are hospitalized with the disease. In response to the dire situation, a group of doctors from multiple hospitals in South Florida held a news conference to urge people in the community to get vaccinated and wear masks. ""We are all here together with one simple message that can save your life: please go get vaccinated and wear a mask,"" Dr. Jennifer Buczyner, a neurologist who organized the event, said Aug. 23. ""A large majority of hospitalized COVID patients are unvaccinated. Many of these patients have decided not to get vaccinated but when they are hospitalized they tell us they wish they had."" But misleading headlines and social media posts sought to undermine the group’s message by falsely claiming that the physicians had ""walked off"" the job in ""protest"" while patients needed their care and suffered.  ""75 doctors in #SouthFlorida walkout in protest as their hospital is flooded with unvaccinated COVID-19 patients,"" read one post shared widely on Instagram. Conservative show host Dan Bongino said in a Facebook video that he was ""disgusted"" by the doctors and that he ""strongly recommends"" that they leave the profession.

Social media posts claim that about 75 doctors in South Florida walked out in protest as their hospital was overrun with unvaccinated COVID-19 patients.

Evidence shows that COVID-19 variants are largely spread among unvaccinated people
","A Facebook post authored by someone touting toxicology credentials joined the growing field of inaccurate claims that falsely blame the vaccine for a pandemic that has stretched into a second year.  ""It is the vaccinated, NOT the unvaccinated, spreading mutant variants,"" the post reads. The Aug. 13 post was a screenshot of information that appeared to be originally shared by Janci Lindsay, who describes herself as managing director of Toxicology Support Services, LLC. A website for that business states that Lindsay holds a doctorate in biochemistry and molecular biology. The post attributed to her read, ""This is from inoculating during the pandemic with a poor neutralizing ‘vaccine.’ This is what has happened with numerous other ‘leaky’ (non-neutralizing) vaccines.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isn’t the first time claims attributed to Lindsay have been fact-checked. Agence France Presse previously fact checked a video in which someone who identifies herself as Lindsay falsely said vaccines could end up sterilizing ""an entire generation."" A variant of a virus is one that has mutated in a way that bolsters its spread or severity compared with the original strain that emerged in Wuhan, China. RNA viruses like a coronavirus can mutate when they replicate, especially when circulating at high rates. Dr. Daniel B. Fagbuyi, an emergency room physician and former Obama administration appointee to the National Biodefense Science Board, said the Facebook claim’s blanket statement that vaccinations are causing the unvaccinated to get sick misses a key point about when and how the variants developed and spread. ""If that were the case, based on all the other (COVID-19) cases, we wouldn’t have seen all these variants before we got the vaccines,"" Fagbuyi said.  Fagbuyi mentioned the first variant of COVID-19, called B.1.1.7 or the alpha variant, as an example. The alpha variant first emerged in the United Kingdom in September 2020, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It spread across 30 countries, including the United States. Likewise, the World Health Organization reports that other variants such as beta and gamma were first documented in May and November of 2020, respectively. All three of these strains appear to have emerged before the United Kingdom became the first country to approve a COVID-19 vaccine tested in a large clinical trial. While research has found that vaccinated people who become infected with COVID-19 can transmit the virus to others, there is no indication that they are doing it at a faster rate than unvaccinated people. On the contrary, Dr. Amesh Adalja, senior scholar at Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security, pointed out that the newest and most dangerous variant spread most rapidly through unvaccinated populations.  ""The delta variant emerged in a largely unvaccinated country,"" Adalja said, referring to India, where the variant drove soaring case rates starting in the spring of 2021. ""The more the virus spreads, the more chance there is for variants to emerge.""  In her post, Lindsay pointed to Marek's disease in chickens as what she said is a ""classic example"" of what is happening with the COVID-19 vaccine and variants. Marek’s disease is a highly contagious form of herpes found in chicken dander, and is capable of causing widespread paralysis and death in unvaccinated chickens.  A 2015 study showed that chickens immunized against Marek’s disease lived longer, but infection wasn’t prevented and the virus continued to evolve and spread to other chickens.  But the person who wrote the Marek’s disease study, Andrew Read, director of the Huck Institutes for the Life Sciences at Penn State University, said Lindsay’s claim citing his study muddles the facts and misapplies his work. Marek's disease and COVID-19 are totally different viruses, with different vaccines and different hosts, he said. Read pointed to an article describing a scientific analysis of how rapidly the delta variant spread during an outbreak in Guangdong, China. The study, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, found that while it is possible for vaccinated people to transmit the delta variant, unvaccinated people or people who only had one dose of the vaccine were much more likely to transmit the virus than those who were fully vaccinated. ""We simply have no idea at the moment how much transmission is coming from vaccinated people, but to the extent that vaccines stop people getting infected in the first place and then shorten infectious periods and lower virus titers (levels of the virus), then, by definition, less spread is coming from vaccinated people,"" Read said.  Towards the end of her claim, Lindsay stated that vaccines should stop and be replaced with treatment of ""cheap, safe and effective hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin until the virus is driven out."" PolitiFact has previously fact-checked claims on both of these medicines, and reported that the FDA revoked its approval of hydroxychloroquine in June 2020 due to its ineffectiveness in treating COVID-19, and did not approve of ivermectin as a treatment because it is not a drug used to treat viral infections, and large doses of it can be dangerous. PolitiFact reached out to Lindsay for a request to comment, and she stood by her full claim.  A Facebook post claimed that it is vaccinated people, not unvaccinated, who spread mutant variants of COVID-19. Alpha, beta, gamma and delta variants were first detected in unvaccinated populations. Most variants were detected before vaccines were even approved for use and they have accelerated in unvaccinated populations. While research has found that vaccinated people who become infected with COVID-19 are able to transmit the virus, studies also show that unvaccinated people are far more likely to contract and spread the delta variant than vaccinated people.

Rick Perry says Rick Santorum voted for the Bridge to Nowhere
","
A day before the Iowa caucuses, Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s presidential campaign posted online a video that portrays rival candidate Rick Santorum as a supporter of pork-barrel spending during the 16 years he served in Congress. 
Calling Santorum ""a porker's best friend,"" the video, using on-screen text, gives several examples, including that ""Santorum voted to spend millions on the Bridge to Nowhere."" 
Perry’s campaign made the same charge in a radio ad that it released in Iowa on Dec. 29, 2011. Mimicking the format of a game show, Perry's ad kicks off with an announcer asking: ""Which Republican running for president voted for the Bridge to Nowhere earmark?"" The ""correct"" answer comes from contestant ""Susie from Des Moines,"" who responds by naming Santorum. (He represented Pennsylvania in the U.S. Senate from 1995 to 2007 after serving two terms in the U.S. House.) 
We wondered whether Perry was right that Santorum had voted for the now-infamous bridge project? 
Perry's charge takes us back to 2005, when the nearly $400 million plan to connect the Alaskan city of Ketchikan (population about 8,000) with Gravina, an island with a few dozen residents and an airport, became an object of national ridicule and a symbol of federal pork-barrel spending. Critics pointed to the bridge plan as evidence that congressional earmarking — the setting aside of federal money for pet projects — had run amok, and on Nov. 6, 2005, Parade magazine highlighted the project in a cover story with the headline ""Are Your Tax Dollars Being Wasted?"" 
The project was again thrust into the spotlight during the 2008 presidential contest. The Republican nominee, Sen. John McCain of Arizona, used the bridge to highlight his record of fighting against pork-barrel spending. And perhaps most memorably, McCain's running mate, then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, said repeatedly during the campaign that she ""told Congress, 'Thanks, but no thanks,' on that Bridge to Nowhere"" — a statement rated Half True by the PolitiFact Truth-O-Meter. 
As backup for Perry's statement that Santorum had voted for the project, the governor's campaign points to a ""presidential white paper"" about Santorum by the Washington-based anti-tax group The Club for Growth. The assessment of Santorum's record on economic issues in the U.S. Senate concludes that ""on the whole,"" he was ""above average."" However, the paper says Santorum was weak in some areas, including on spending during the Bush administration. 
Santorum ""voted for the 2005 highway bill that included thousands of wasteful earmarks, including the Bridge to Nowhere,"" the paper says, referring to a $286.5 billion federal highway and transportation bill that included about $225 million for the Gravina Island bridge project. 
On July 29, 2005, the U.S. Senate passed the legislation with a vote of 91-4. Santorum was among the backers of the bill. 
But does that prove correct Perry's statement that Santorum voted for the Bridge to Nowhere? Not quite. In other fact-checks, PolitiFact has dismissed that claim because the Senate wasn't voting yes-or-no just on the Alaska bridge. Funding for the bridge project was less than one-tenth of 1 percent of the spending in the transportation bill. 
However, the Club for Growth white paper points to another Senate vote related to the bridge project that took place about three months later: ""In a separate vote, Santorum had the audacity to vote to continue funding the Bridge to Nowhere rather than send the money to rebuild New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina."" 
The paper was referring to a vote on an amendment in a later transportation appropriations bill that called for stripping some funding from the Bridge to Nowhere project. The amendment, sponsored by Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., sought to redirect part of the funding to a project to rebuild the Twin Spans bridge between New Orleans and Slidell, La., which had been damaged during Hurricane Katrina. 
The amendment failed 82-15. Santorum was in the majority, voting against killing the funding for the Bridge to Nowhere. 
After the amendment's defeat, lawmakers hashing out differences between the House and Senate measure of the appropriations bill removed the earmark for the bridge project and instead provided the money directly to Alaska's transportation department to spend on whatever projects it saw fit. That funding still could have gone to the Ketchikan-Gravina Island span, but ultimately the bridge was never built. 
After Perry's earmark-related attack in Iowa, Santorum defended his record in interviews. Speaking with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly on Dec. 29, Santorum said: ""If you look at the Constitution, the Constitution gives the power of the purse to the Congress, and the Congress is the one that's supposed to spend the money. And so the idea that earmarks are somehow against the Constitution or something that is illicit that a congressman … shouldn't do is just simply factually incorrect."" 
Santorum also said that since leaving Congress, he has defended his earmarks because he is proud of the money that he set aside ""for things that were priorities in my state, instead of having bureaucrats do that."" But, Santorum said, he now recognizes that Americans view earmarks as ""a pox upon the Congress"" and as president, he would oppose them. 
The same day, Santorum addressed Perry's ""Bridge to Nowhere"" charge specifically, according to a Des Moines Register news article. 
The story says Santorum, speaking to reporters while on the campaign trail in Iowa, acknowledged that some earmarks are controversial. ""People say that I voted for the Bridge to Nowhere,"" Santorum said, according to the Register story. ""I did. I went with the federalist argument, which is: 'Who am I in Pennsylvania to tell Alaska what their highway priorities should be?' You had a city that was separated from its airport and of course in Alaska, you have to travel by air, and you had to have a ferry. There were times when they couldn’t get across."" 
Our ruling 
Perry said that as a senator, Santorum voted for the Bridge to Nowhere. Santorum did, a charge that he hasn't disputed. He voted for a giant spending bill that included money for the bridge project and then later voted to maintain federal funding for the project. On the Texas Truth-O-Meter, an accurate statement that could benefit from such clarification or additional material is considered Mostly True.

"['Animals', 'Rhode Island', 'Congress', 'History', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Chain email']","
Chain e-mail claims that when baboons congregate, it's called a 'congress.'
","""We are all familiar with a herd of cows, a flock of chickens, a school of fish and a gaggle of geese,"" the e-mail begins. ""However, less widely known is a pride of lions, a murder of crows (as well as their cousins the rooks and ravens), an exaltation of doves and, presumably because they look so wise, a parliament of owls.

""Now consider a group of baboons. They are the loudest, most dangerous, most obnoxious, most viciously aggressive and least intelligent of all primates. And what is the proper collective noun for a group of baboons? Believe it or not ... a Congress! I guess that pretty much explains the things that come out of Washington!""

We at PolitiFact have learned from experience to be skeptical of anything we see in the contagion of e-mails we receive. But we wondered, since we're always skeptical of our own skepticism, could this just be a joke, or could this little tidbit be true?

First stop: Dictionary.com. None of the definitions for congress referred to baboons, apes, monkeys or primates. A ""congress"" can be a meeting or session of any group, but the e-mail makes it clear that this is a specific term for a gathering of baboons.

Merriam-Webster.com also produced negative results. So did the online version of the Oxford Dictionary and the 2,059-page Random House Unabridged Dictionary from 1973 in our newsroom.

Two places where we did find it were sources in which virtually anybody could insert a definition on a whim: Wikipedia and UrbanDictionary.com. (In the Urban Dictionary, someone added the definition on Sept. 3, 2011, in response to the e-mail.)

So we turned to Orin Hargraves, a freelance lexicographer and president of the Dictionary Society of North America.

The names for collections of animals are called ""terms of venery,"" and Hargraves said the best reference source for them is the 1968 book ""An Exaltation of Larks"" by James Lipton, host of ""Inside the Actors Studio.""

The first part of the book, which examines real terms, has no reference to baboons. Only in the section that includes whimsical terms that Lipton coined or uncovered is there any reference to the primates. ""A rumpus of baboons"" is listed right next to ""a buffoonery of orangutans."" (One of our favorites: ""a prickle of porcupines."")

Hargraves could find no evidence that congress is the correct term. ""Apparently someone just made it up,"" he said. ""It has the ring of truthiness and so people like it. They do behave like the caricature of the baboons, but I think real baboons probably behave a lot better.""

We also turned to two anthropologists who really know baboons.

Shirley Strum is at the University of California, San Diego, and director of the Uaso Ngiro Baboon Project in Nairobi,Kenya. Larissa Swedell is at Queens College of the City University of New York and studies the primates in Ethiopia and South Africa.

Both said the correct term for a group of baboons is a ""troop.""

""I have never heard the term congress used for a group of baboons!"" Swedell said in an e-mail.

""I would prefer to be governed by baboons than the current Congress, however!!! They are more socially committed, abide by the golden rule and are generally nicer people,"" said Strum, also in an e-mail.

Swedell disputed the e-mail’s description of baboons. ""Least intelligent? No way. … Among monkeys, baboons are pretty smart,"" she said, adding that chimpanzees are probably more dangerous.

Baboons are ""socially sophisticated and incredibly smart"" and among primates, ""no species is as dangerous as humans,"" said Strum. ""Only baboons who have been spoiled by humans feeding them are dangerous and are never as aggressive as humans.""

Finally, we searched Google Books for ""congress of baboons"" and came up with just 10 books with the phrase. In contrast, ""troop of baboons"" produced 393 hits.

Our ruling

The e-mail claiming that a group of baboons is known as a congress states the claim as fact and tickles our sense of irony at a time when the U.S. Congress' approval rating is about 16 percent or lower.

But the correct term is a ""troop.""

You may be tempted to call the U.S. Congress a group of baboons, yet a group of baboons is not a congress.

If someone presents this joke e-mail to you as the truth, tell them they need to step away from the smoke detector because they've got Pants On Fire!

"['New Jersey', 'Transportation', 'Steve Lonegan']","
Steve Lonegan says with New Year’s Day toll hike, New Jersey motorists face most expensive tolls in the U.S.
","
New Jersey motorists may be fuming over the New Year’s Day toll hikes. But a conservative activist has a case for serious road rage: he claims New Jersey now has the most expensive tolls in the country.

Steve Lonegan, director of Americans for Prosperity’s New Jersey chapter, railed against the Jan. 1 toll increase in a newsletter last week.

""Did You Know? Tolls on the New Jersey Turnpike, Garden State Parkway, & Atlantic City Expressway Are Set to Go Up 50% on Jan. 1!"" the headline on Lonegan’s Dec. 27 email newsletter said.

Further down, he wrote: ""New Jersey taxpayers, the most over-burdened in the nation, will now face the highest tolls in the country with no noticeable improvement in service.""

First, tolls are not increasing on the Expressway. But residents are forking over 50 percent more to drive on the Parkway and 53 percent more to drive on the Turnpike. Are those tolls now the highest in the country?

That’s one claim to fame New Jersey doesn’t have.

The state isn’t top in the country by cost per mile -- a measure several experts said was more significant --  or actual toll prices, according to statistical comparisons.

Driving the full span of the Parkway in a passenger car paying cash or E-ZPass now costs $8.25, up from $5.50. A start-to-finish trip for a car paying cash on the Turnpike goes for $13.85 now, up from $9.05.

Compare that to $35.55 for a trip from Ohio to New Jersey on the Pennsylvania Turnpike. That’s a cost of more than nine cents per mile -- more than the Parkway, but less than the Turnpike.

An analysis conducted for the New Jersey Turnpike Authority by Wilbur Smith Associates, a transportation and infrastructure consulting firm, shows the cost per mile on the Parkway for a car paying cash is now 4.8 cents, up from 3.2 cents. The Turnpike would cost the same motorist 11.3 cents per mile, up from 7.4 cents.

Still, there are more than a dozen other roads that charge more than both the Parkway and Turnpike, according to the same analysis.

Motorists on Route 73 in California pay 38.3 cents per mile, the Dulles Greenway in Virginia costs drivers 34.3 cents per mile and E-470 in Colorado will set you back 33.4 cents per mile

""It seems to me that while the rates for NJ may seem high compared to their past rates – they are nowhere near ‘the highest tolls in the country,’"" Neil Gray, the director of government affairs for the International Bridge, Tunnel and Turnpike Association, an association that aims to advance toll financed transportation, said in an email.

""It’s ridiculous to say that they’re going to be the highest in the country,"" said Peter Samuel, editor of the trade publication Toll Roads News.

Steve Carrellas, the New Jersey representative of the National Motorists Association, which opposes tolls, said, ""they’re not the highest.""

Lonegan conceded that the per-mile cost on New Jersey’s toll roads aren’t the highest in the country. But he argued New Jersey drivers face the highest toll burden in the country.

Motorists have alternatives to ""boutique"" toll roads in other areas, while drivers in New Jersey are forced to rely on the Parkway and Turnpike, Lonegan said.

For a driver heading south from Lonegan's hometown of Bogota, he said ""it’s not even practical to think that you are going to take 1&9 to Atlantic City.""  

""It’s not as cut and dry as saying the cost per mile,"" he said. ""We are very much trapped into using these roads.""

Our ruling

With a toll hike on the Parkway and Turnpike, New Jersey now has ""the highest tolls in the country,"" according to Lonegan.

Lonegan argued that New Jersey’s toll burden is greater than the rest of the country. But he said ""highest tolls"" in his newsletter and there are other roads charging more per mile for drivers to head out on the highway.

We rate the claim False.

NRCC claims Betty Sutton supports welfare fund access at casinos, strip clubs and liquor stores
","
It didn’t take long for the National Republican Congressional Committee to ramp up political attacks on Rep. Betty Sutton after the Democrat from Copley Township, near Akron, Ohio, announced she’ll run next year against GOP Rep. Jim Renacci.

The day after Sutton’s announcement Dec. 7, the campaign arm for Republicans in the House of Representatives issued a news release that accused Sutton and dozens of other targeted Democrats of opposing ""efforts to prevent job-killing regulations that hurt America's farmers.""

Next it launched a web ad that attacked Sutton over the Obama administration’s decision to postpone action on construction of the Keystone XL oil pipeline.

Then, on Dec. 13, it produced a news release that blasted Sutton for opposing a GOP bill that tied a payroll tax cut extension sought by Democrats with a host of GOP priorities. The bill, titled the ""Middle Class Tax Relief & Job Creation Act,"" included an accelerated review of the oil pipeline, restrictions on unemployment benefits, reforms to the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program, an extended pay freeze for federal workers including Congress members, provisions to defund health care reforms and restrictions on the Environmental Protection Agency.

Before the vote, President Barack Obama said he wouldn’t accept a measure that tied the payroll tax cuts to ""a whole bunch of extraneous issues."" Leaders of the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate said it would die there after it passed the House. And in fact, the Senate approved different legislation with bipartisan support to temporarily extend the payroll tax cut.

The GOP press release maintained Sutton’s vote against the measure constituted her support for a tax increase on middle class families, giving herself a pay raise, and allowing ""welfare fund withdrawals from strip clubs, casinos and liquor stores.""

Any of these claims might provide fodder for examination by PolitiFact Ohio, but we were particularly curious about the group’s charge that Sutton supports withdrawal of welfare money from adult entertainment facilities.

We asked NRCC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek where it came from. She said that many state welfare recipients use benefit transfer cards to withdraw their money from automatic teller machines. Although the money is supposed to be used to meet their subsistence needs, several investigative reports have found the money is sometimes withdrawn from ATMs located in places  where gambling and adult-oriented activities take place. That has prompted several legislators to introduce measures to crack down on the practice, one of which was included in the larger bill that Sutton voted against.

""There’s no reason why welfare recipients should be gambling away our taxpayer dollars at strip clubs or casinos instead of feeding their families and finding a good job,"" said Bozek, contending that Sutton voted to ""continue this abuse of taxpayer funds.""

Sutton spokesman Anthony DeAngelo said Sutton supports extending the payroll tax cuts as well as banning welfare money withdrawals at adult-oriented establishments, but voted against the December 13 bill because she opposed some of the other provisions it contained.

Sutton herself noted that she backed a separate bill the House of Representatives adopted without opposition on December 15 which imposed the welfare money restrictions as it extended the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families Program. The measure was considered so non-controversial that it was approved on a ""voice vote"" that did not record the ""yeas"" or ""nays"" of individual members.

There is an element of truth in the the NRCC’s claim. Sutton, along with 178 other Democrats and 14 Republicans, did oppose the House bill.

But it ignores critical facts that would give the listener a different impression. Namely, there’s a world of difference between opposing a bill laden with partisan provisions and supporting, as the NRCC says, ""welfare fund withdrawals from strip clubs, casinos and liquor stores.""

And the subsequent bipartisan support for the same welfare reforms just underscores that point.

On the Truth-O-Meter we rate the NRCC’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/02/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-claims-betty-sutton-supports-welfare-fund-acc/

Rep. David Cicilline says the Right-to-Carry Act would expand rights of ""sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.""
","
U.S. Rep. David Cicilline, a Democrat from Rhode Island and former mayor of Providence, has joined current mayors of cities around the country to fight a gun-permit bill pending in Congress.

The National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act (H.R. 822), sponsored by U.S. Rep. Clifford Stearns, R-Fla., would require all states to recognize out-of-state permits for carrying concealed weapons.

The House approved the bill 272 to 154 on Nov. 16, 2011. Cicilline and Rep. James Langevin, also a Democrat from Rhode Island, both voted against it. The bill is before the Senate Judiciary Committee. (A similar measure was narrowly defeated in the Senate in 2009.)

Federal law restricts who can own or possess a firearm, and bans possession by anyone convicted of a felony. But the rules for getting a permit to carry a concealed weapon vary from state to state.

Nine states, including Rhode Island, don’t recognize out-of-state gun permits, according to Mayors Against Illegal Guns.

In a Nov. 18 fundraising letter e-mailed to constituents, Cicilline attacked Republicans and ""Tea Partiers"" for supporting the Right-to-Carry bill.  

""Earlier this week, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives -- with the enthusiastic support of Sarah Palin, Texas Governor Rick Perry, and the Tea Partiers -- once again turned their backs on the 14 million unemployed Americans in our country,"" the letter says, ""and instead chose to focus their efforts on expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.""

Sex offenders? Terrorists? Child predators and abusers?

""I told you: you wouldn’t believe it,"" the letter continues.

Actually, we weren’t sure what to believe. So we decided to check it out.

The facts

We focused on the second part of the statement: ""expanding the rights of sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.’’

The phrase ""expanding the rights’’ suggests that these criminals currently have the right to carry concealed weapons. But do they?

Cicilline and his staff offered numerous examples, both hypothetical and real, to argue that, under the bill, criminals in each of the four categories could legally carry a concealed firearm into a state such as Rhode Island, which would amount to ""expanding their rights.""

We checked what they offered and will summarize our findings, looking at the categories separately.

Domestic abusers

Under federal law, anyone convicted of a crime of domestic violence, including misdemeanors, or anyone subject to a court restraining order cannot legally own or possess a firearm.

Cicilline’s staff provided us with information from Mayors Against Illegal Guns about four cases (in Missouri, Idaho, Florida and Pennsylvania) in which domestic abusers were granted concealed weapon permits and went on to commit murder.

In three of the cases (those from Florida, Idaho and Missouri), authorities failed to enforce the federal law banning domestic abusers from possessing weapons, according to the summaries provided. In none of those cases did the abusers have the right to carry concealed weapons. So the Right-to-Carry Act can’t expand a right they don’t have.

But in the Pennsylvania case, our research confirmed that the killer was granted a concealed weapons permit, despite a prior restraining order for domestic abuse. There were nothing to prohibit the state from granting the permit because the restraining order had been withdrawn.

So in the domestic abuse category, one of the four examples that Cicilline’s staff provided -- the Pennsylvania case -- supports his claim that some people with a record of domestic abuse can legally carry a concealed weapon.

Child predators

Adults who sexually prey on children are prohibited by federal law from owning or possessing firearms if they have been convicted of a felony.

And sex crimes against children are almost always felonies.

But the term ""child predator,"" Cicilline’s staff said in a follow-up e-mail, speaks more broadly about crimes that ""lead up to or are related to child molestation.’’
misdemeanor
They referred us to laws regarding sex-crimes against minors in states such as Florida, Georgia and New Hampshire, where there are no laws preventing such criminals from getting concealed weapon permits.

We believe that some of the examples Cicilline’s staff provided, including a Georgia law that makes unwanted sexual touching of a 16-year-old a misdemeanor, stretch the meaning of the term ""child predator.""

But in New Hampshire, an adult who lures a child into engaging in sex for pornography -- a misdemeanor in that state -- is clearly a child predator.

So that example met the test.

Sex offenders

Federal law prohibits sex offenders convicted of felonies from owning or possessing firearms.

But Cicilline’s staff noted that someone convicted of a misdemeanor sex offense involving another adult would not automatically be barred from getting a concealed weapon permit in some states.

In New Hampshire, for example, it’s a misdemeanor for correctional officers to engage in sex with someone over whom they have authority.

Ann Rice, a New Hampshire deputy attorney general, said conviction for such a crime would not automatically bar someone from getting a concealed weapon permit.

In this category, we verified that the type of case cited by Cicilline’s staff supports his statement.

Terrorists

Federal law bars anyone arrested, charged or convicted of acts of terrorism from owning or possessing a firearm. The Right-to-Carry bill clearly would not expand their rights.

But Cicilline and his staff offered a broader definition of ""terrorist"" to support the congressman’s claim.

They said people convicted under  state terrorism laws, adopted in several cases after the Sept. 11 attacks, and people on the federal government’s terrorist watchlist could be considered ""terrorists"" or ""suspected terrorists."" 
(In his fundraising letter, Cicilline uses the terms interchangeably, twice referencing ""terrorists"" and once ""suspected terrorists."" In the statement we checked, he said ""terrorists."")

First, let’s look at the state ""terrorism"" laws. Examples provided by Cicilline’s staff include a ""terroristic threatening"" statute in Kentucky that makes it a third-degree misdemeanor to threaten to seriously injure someone or to cause substantial property damage.

We confirmed that someone convicted of ""terroristic threatening"" in Kentucky could, indeed, be eligible for a concealed weapon permit after three years. Florida has a similar statute, though it’s never prosecuted anyone under it.

But are they ""terrorists"" as one would commonly understand the term? We don’t think so.

Now, let’s consider people on the terrorist watchlist.

During a conference call, Cicilline said there are ""thousands of people engaging in terrorism"" who have never been convicted of any act of terrorism or other offenses that would disqualify them from possessing a firearm. And in states with lax gun permitting laws, he said, these ""terrorists"" can and do get concealed weapons permits

So, if the Right-to-Carry bill becomes law, he reasons, they could legally bring their concealed weapons into Rhode Island.

In addition, Cicilline and his staff referred us to a May 2010 report by the U.S. Government Accountability Office citing FBI data that showed that individuals on the watchlist were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 1,228 times from 2004 through 2010.

The GAO found that 91 percent of those transactions were allowed to proceed because no felony convictions or other disqualifying factors were found.

The GAO expressed concerns that ""there was no basis to automatically prohibit a person from possessing a firearm or explosive because the person’s name appeared on the terrorist watchlist,"" Eileen R. Larence, director, Homeland Security and Justice at the GAO, said in an e-mail.

But being on the terrorist watchlist isn’t the same as being a terrorist.

It turns out there were more than 400,000 unique names and over 1 million entries on the terrorist watchlist at the end of 2009, according to The Washington Post. The list at one time mistakenly included the late U.S. Sen. Ted Kennedy, whose name was later removed.

So, under the Right-to-Carry Act, it’s possible that people on the terrorism watchlist could legally carry a concealed weapon in states where they currently cannot.

Does that mean that the rights of ""terrorists"" would be expanded? Again, no because they are not necessarily terrorists.

What about Cicilline’s argument that, for the purposes of determining who has the ""right"" to a carry a concealed weapon, there is no real distinction between a terrorist and a ""suspected terrorist""?

We believe there is a distinction. Otherwise, the more than 400,000 people named on the terrorist watchlist in 2009 could have been considered terrorists.

(It’s worth noting that among the more than half-dozen cases of shootings Cicilline’s staff provided to back up his claims, none involved a state legally granting a concealed weapons permit to a convicted terrorist, or to someone who, at the time, was a terrorism suspect.)

In this category, we concluded that the examples cited by Cicilline’s staff were based on an overly broad definition of ""terrorist"" and did not support his claim.

Our ruling

Cicilline said the Right-to-Carry bill would expand rights of ""sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers to carry concealed weapons across state lines.""

In three categories -- sex offenders, child predators and abusers -- we agreed that in some narrow exceptions involving misdemeanor crimes, his statement was true.

But we found that his statement didn’t meet the test on the fourth. To apply the ""terrorist"" label to all 400,000 people on the government’s watchlist, or to those convicted of a misdemeanor ""terroristic"" threat, is, at best, an exaggeration.  

Further, by saying the Republicans ""chose to focus their efforts"" on expanding the gun rights of ""sex offenders, terrorists, child predators, and abusers,"" he implied, with a heavy dose of hyperbole, that this was their intent.

Because the statement ""is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context,"" we rule it Half True.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Ron Paul']","
Ron Paul says newsletters contained only eight or 10 sentences of 'bad stuff'
","
As the buzz surrounding Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul continues to grow heading into the Jan. 3, 2011, caucuses in Iowa, media reports have renewed national scrutiny of controversial passages in newsletters that were published under his name from the mid-1970s through the mid-1990s. Material in the letters has been described as racist, anti-gay and anti-Israel. 
Questioned Dec. 29, 2011, by a caller on an Iowa radio talk show, the longtime Republican congressman from Texas said that he wrote pieces on economics for the newsletters but that ""there were many times"" he didn’t edit the entire letters and that he didn't know about the most incendiary passages until years later. 
""These were sentences that were put in,"" Paul said during the interview on WHO-AM in Des Moines, Iowa. ""I think there was a total of about eight or 10 sentences. And it was bad stuff, and it wasn't a reflection of my views at all."" Later in the interview, Paul elaborated: ""I actually put a type of a newsletter out — it was a Freedom Report, an Investment Letter, Survival Report, different ways — every month since 1976. This is probably 10 sentences out of, you know, 10,000 pages, for all I know. I think it's bad that it happened, but I disavowed all these views."" 
We wondered whether Paul was right that the sentences at issue numbered only eight or 10. 
First, some background: This is not the first time that Paul has been questioned about the content of his newsletters, which also became an issue in his 1996 U.S. House race and when he ran for president in 2008. In January of that year, the New Republic magazine published a lengthy article on Paul and the newsletters. At the time, it also posted online excerpts from the newsletters, which had such names as Ron Paul’s Freedom Report, Ron Paul Political Report and The Ron Paul Survival Report. 
When questioned this year about the controversial passages in the newsletters, Paul has repeatedly disavowed them, saying that he didn't write them and didn't review them before they appeared in the newsletters. He has also described himself as a negligent publisher, saying that he should have paid more attention to the newsletters' content. 
The New Republic reported that some of the letters were published by the Foundation for Rational Economics and Education, a nonprofit that Paul founded in 1976, while others were published by a now-defunct company called Ron Paul & Associates, which also produced a monthly publication called The Ron Paul Investment Letter, according to the article. 
Although the several dozen pages that The New Republic posted online, dated between 1988 and 1996, represent only a selected sample of Paul's newsletters, we reviewed them and found at least 35 sentences in at least 14 passages over nine different newsletters that we think many people would find inflammatory, although we recognize that opinions about specific passages will differ. 
Several entire items, ranging from a few paragraphs to an entire ""Special Issue on Racial Terrorism,"" would probably fit the bill. Click here for our analysis of the documents. 
The documents sling a range of conspiracy allegations about topics from government control to financial collapse. Several items are anti-homosexual and anti-black; these, as recent news accounts have reported, include a description of the national Martin Luther King Jr. holiday as ""Hate Whitey Day"" and a statement that during the riots after the 1992 Rodney King verdict, ""order was only restored in L.A. when it was time for the blacks to pick up their welfare checks."" 
Other examples of inflammatory remarks: A newsletter excerpt that The New Republic listed as being from October 1992 describes ""urban youth who play unsuspecting whites like pianos,"" and an item on AIDS reportedly from a September 1994 newsletter mentions the danger of being infected by ""a malicious gay."" 
Our ruling 
Paul says the newsletters that bore his name contained only eight to 10 sentences of ""bad stuff."" Although ""bad stuff"" is in the eye of the beholder, we found nearly three dozen sentences that we think many would find inflammatory — and that's just in the excerpts we had access to. Paul's statement is False.",/factchecks/2011/dec/31/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-newsletters-contained-only-eight-or-/
"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Yes on 79 ']","
Are Oregon home sellers really subject to a double tax?
","
While we were trolling for some new facts to check, a rather urgent ad popped out at us on one of our favorite conservative websites: ""Sign the Petition. Stop Unfair, Double Taxes,"" it read. The text was superimposed on a picture of a home with a ""For Sale"" sign.

We were curious, so we clicked through. We landed on a website for Protect Oregon Homes. There, the same pitch continued in earnest. We were greeted with a picture of a home for sale. ""Sold -- with double tax!"" read the sign out front. On the side of the page was a calculator that helps visitors compute their property transfer tax. It was preset at just under 2 percent of the sales price.

""Sign the Petition! We need your help to stop unfair, double taxation on real estate,"" is the first bit of text on the site, referring to a push for a constitutional ban on real estate transfer taxes.

Wow, we thought. Do we really have a double tax on real estate? We decided to check.

The taxation that the site is looking to ""stop"" would kick into effect when a home swaps hands.

Protect Oregon Homes, backed by the Oregon Association of Realtors, is looking to amend the state constitution to bar ""state/local governments from imposing taxes, fees, assessments on transfer of any interest in real property.""

There’s just one problem. When we looked a little further, we found out that there is only one such tax in the entire state (Washington County imposes a 0.1 percent transfer tax) and this proposed legislation would grandfather that charge in, just as previous legislation did.

What’s more, beside that one-time Washington County exception, under current law, cities, counties and other jurisdictions don’t have the power to impose taxes on real estate transfers.

So what gives? What would an amendment be stopping?

Shaun Jillions, a spokesperson for Oregon Association of Realtors, explains it this way: ""There's nothing in that (current) statute that stops the state Legislature from"" instituting one or repealing the current ban.

His line was pretty close to the one featured on the group’s website: The ""state Legislature has the authority, subject to governor approval, to impose such taxes and fees or to change current statutory law,"" the site says. ""Local officials would welcome any source of new revenue to keep their operations going. A new revenue stream from a tax on property sales would be very tempting ... We need a law to take this law off the table. Forever.""

Essentially, this is all about a strong defense being the best offense. The website even says so: ""During the past five legislative sessions, there have been nine attempts to authorize such a tax at the state or local level.""

Jillions mentioned that same fact and even followed up a with a list of of the bills Realtors had been tracking. A single bill was introduced in the 2011 session but died without a hearing. The same happened to three bills during the 2009 session. In 2007, a bill that would open up the doors to transfer taxes did get multiple hearings, but it failed, too. Two bills in 2005 died without hearings and in 2003 two bills were introduced, only one got a single hearing, and both ultimately died.

We asked Jillions about the poor showing most of these bills made. Did it seem a little disingenuous to say that there’s a double tax when there’s a law banning such charges and the bills put forward to end that ban have been largely dead on arrival? ""That might have something to do with the lobbying efforts of the Oregon Association of Realtors,"" he said.

We went one step further to gauge the Legislature’s interest in repealing the current ban and talked to Sen. Ginny Burdick, one of the chairs of the Revenue Committee. ""I've not heard any push to do this in February, "" she said, referring to the next time the Legislature meets. ""It's certainly not on my priority list.

""I don't see this coming up in the near future, but with the budget problems we have any revenue source can and should be on the table.""

Jillions also pointed to the fact that Multnomah County Commissioner Deborah Kafoury has been bullish about such a tax. Indeed, she sponsored a bill to overturn the ban back in 2003 when she was a state lawmaker. Most recently, she told Willamette Week that ""putting a pre-emption into the constitution is really tying the hands of local voters. It’s already state law, and I don’t see why that’s not good enough.""

Finally, Jillions told us to take a look at a report issued in June 2008 by the governor’s Task Force on Federal Forest Payments and County Services. In the report, there’s a suggestion that the state drop its pre-emption of real estate transfer taxes. But that was issued years ago and we’re no closer to passing legislation of that nature now than we were then.

Even with the report, the noncommittal statements from Burdick and a possible interest from one county commissioner, it doesn’t seem like a transfer tax is imminent, let alone even in existence.  

The Protect Oregon Homes website says signing the petition will ""help to stop unfair, double taxation on real estate"" when, in fact, there is only one such tax in Oregon and the repeal they’re floating would do nothing to end it. What’s more, a repeal of the current pre-emption, while certainly possible, is not something that the Legislature appears to be actively considering.

Protect Oregon Homes acknowledges some of these points on their website, which tempers our ruling somewhat, but the general feeling you get from the group is that there’s a tax on the books -- or there will be soon -- and only a constitutional amendment will stop it. In fact, there is no double tax to stop.

We give the group a Half True for this claim -- it’s partially accurate but leaves out some essential context.",/factchecks/2011/dec/30/Yes-on-79/are-oregon-home-sellers-really-subject-double-tax/

Cantor says small businesses create 70 percent of U.S. jobs
","
What’s good for small business is good for the U.S.A., House Majority Leader Eric Cantor has long proclaimed.

""Small businesses are the driving force of the economy and create 70 percent of the jobs in America,"" Cantor, R-7th, said in a Nov. 25 news release stating his support for legislation that would make it more difficult for Washington to impose regulations on small companies.   

We wondered if small firms really create more than two-thirds of jobs in the U.S. So we asked Cantor’s office what his statement was based on.

Megan Whittemore, a spokeswoman for Cantor, directed us to a September 2010 report from the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy. The study said that 60 to 80 percent of all new jobs come from small businesses.

Cantor’s estimate falls midway between that range.

What, exactly, is a small business? Federal tax law does not offer a standard definition of the term. The SBA, however, defines a small business as an enterprise with fewer than 500 employees.

Brian Headd, an economist with the SBA, said Cantor’s statement is pretty much on the mark.

""You can look at different time periods. The numbers will go up and down depending on the year,"" Headd said. ""So it’s a reasonable general statement to make.""

The SBA research shows small companies typically generate the most net new jobs -- a figure that takes into account job creation from start-ups and expansions as well as job losses from business closings and contractions.

In a March 2010 report, Headd said data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that from 1993 through the middle of 2009, small businesses created about 65 percent of the net new jobs in the country.

We went in search of a more recent synopsis. The SBA directed us to figures from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showing the net increase in jobs each quarter broken down by the size of a firm.

In the first quarter of 2011, the latest period for which data were available, there were 300,000 net new jobs, about 85 percent of which were created by businesses that have less than 500 employees, according to the BLS data.

In 2010, small firms accounted for about 60 percent of the nearly 1.2 million jobs created.

We should add a quick qualifier here: The SBA findings only pertain to net new jobs created in the private sector and don’t take into account jobs created by local, state and federal governments.

Still, when public officials cite the SBA’s findings on the percentage of jobs created by small businesses, they often refer to small firms creating 70 percent of ""all new jobs,"" or 70 percent of new jobs without noting that’s the percentage for private sector jobs created by smaller firms. That’s understandable since the private sector employs the vast majority of workers in the U.S. In September 2011, the private companies provided nearly 110 million -- or about 85 percent -- of the roughly 131 million jobs in the U.S., according to the BLS.

One could reasonably expect small businesses to generate the most jobs in the private sector since, according to the SBA, small firms make up 98 percent of the businesses in the U.S. Overall, about half of the private sector jobs that exist in the U.S. are provided by small businesses, according to the SBA.

Though they provide a boost to job creation when times are good, the SBA noted in a 2010 report to President Barack Obama that the flip side is that small businesses can lead the way on job losses when the economy is sluggish.

In 2009, when the economy was limping out of a recession, small businesses accounted for about 60 percent of the roughly 5.7 million jobs lost, according to BLS figures.

Our ruling:

Eric Cantor said small business create 70 percent of the jobs in the U.S.

Data from the Small Business Administration and the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that statement is correct when talking about the new jobs created in the private sector, which provides the majority of the jobs in the U.S.

Did Multnomah County voters favor a library district with November 2010 vote?
","
There’s a battle brewing over at Multnomah County Board of Commissioners headquarters and it has to do with our vaunted library system. Chairman Jeff Cogen wants to ask voters to renew a multiyear levy this spring; in other words, maintain the status quo. Commissioners Diane McKeel and Judy Shiprack want the county board to go further and place before voters a measure that would create a new library district, raising property taxes to pay for it.

In a guest column, the two commissioners wrote that voters should get the chance to call the question on a permanent funding mechanism for county libraries:

""In November 2010, voters overwhelmingly supported the idea of creating a district. It is up to the board to decide which funding mechanism will be voted on in May 2012. We believe that Multnomah County commissioners should give voters the opportunity to support a true funding solution.""

We think it’s worthwhile to revisit that general election, to remind readers what happened with the library in November 2010. After all, McKeel and Shiprack are using the election to support their argument that county voters are willing to pay more for a library district. The stakes are high: If the board decides to go for a ballot measure that then fails with voters, the library is even more out of luck.

So, what happened in November 2010? Well, in early 2010 a library subcommittee advised the county charter review committee to put Measure 26-114 on the ballot. The measure changed the charter to allow county commissioners to go directly to voters to create a permanent library tax district, sometime in the future, without seeking taxing approval from cities. The measure by itself did not create a library district.

It’s accurate to say that voter approval was overwhelming, with 72 percent of voters saying yes.

But consider that proponents pitched the measure as technical in nature. Backers went out of their way to say that passage of the measure itself would not mean approval of a library district or the increase in taxes that such a district would entail.

Here’s a sampling from arguments in favor of the measure:

""Measure 26-114 is not a tax increase. It lets voters decide whether, in the future, a special library district can be formed – to protect and ensure library funding,"" wrote local librarians.

""The measure asks whether the county should be able to set up a special library district sometime in the future, with voter approval. Nothing would occur without voter approval,"" wrote local parents of young children.

""Measure 26-114 is a change to the county charter on the November ballot. It is not a tax increase,"" wrote local library volunteers.

And, finally, here comes local resident Amy Mamdouh:

""The measure is not a tax increase. It simply allows the library to have the option in the future to be protected through the creation of a special library district. It only creates the option, not the actual district. And that would require voter approval."" (our emphasis)

Granted, a voter opposed to the possibility -- or the idea -- of a library district probably voted against the measure. But we don’t think the opposite is true. In other words, we’re not convinced that a person voting yes necessarily supported the idea of automatically creating a library district.

We turned to Portland political analyst and lobbyist Len Bergstein for help. He said the November vote, no matter how overwhelming, doesn’t say much. Seriously, how hard is it to get people to say yes to the library without any of the pain?

""You have to pause and say, ‘Am I hearing what the voters are saying, or am I hearing what I want to hear they’re saying?’"" he said. ""That measure did not answer the question; it gave an argument to someone who’s a smart advocate, like Judy Shiprack.""

We also asked Dan Meek, a Portland attorney with heavy ballot measure experience, for his opinion. He finds the statement worth correcting, but not significantly misleading.

""So, technically, voters did not support ‘the idea of creating a district.’ They supported the idea of allowing Multnomah County to ask voters later for permission to create a district,"" he said.

We agree. And in fact, a poll conducted in July shows that ""only 40 percent of likely voters would support a new taxing district, which would cost a typical homeowner about $48 more a year than the existing levy."" (The current levy maintains a tax of 89 cents per $1,000 in assessed value; a library district would raise that tax to $1.19.)

Shiprack and McKeel both argue that the phrasing in the guest column -- voting on the ""idea"" of a district -- is broad enough to make the statement 100 percent accurate.

Multnomah County voters ""are discerning, and I think they are very aware that what they voted on was the possibility of a district and that’s, I think, the same as the idea of creating a district,"" Shiprack said in an interview. ""What I am supporting is having them come back to the polls and vote on the idea.""

She added, ""I don’t think Commissioner McKeel and I have a Pants on Fire.""  
   
We don’t think the statement merits a Pants on Fire either. But we do think the characterization of what county voters approved in November 2010 needs fuller information. It’s not fair to conflate overwhelming support for a technical change in the charter with overwhelming support for a new, and pricier, library district.

For that reason, we rate the statement Half True -- partially accurate but leaving out important details, such as the exact nature of the measure.

Broun: 315,000 Americans gave up looking for work
","
Want to make voters pay attention? Use the word ""jobs.""

The national unemployment rate may be down, but the economy’s still in a jobs funk. Congress is under pressure from virtually all sides to pass legislation that encourages job creation, or at least saves jobs.

So when U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, R-Athens, used the ""J"" word in a recent press release over the payroll tax debate, the eyes of your PolitiFact Georgia scribes were glued to our computer screens.

""The latest unemployment numbers have shown that nearly 315,000 Americans have simply given up hope when it comes to finding a job,"" the Athens Republican’s release said. ""Our economy is barely hanging on as it is, and we cannot risk losing more of our working class to job-killing tax increases.""

Nearly 315,000 Americans have given up on finding work? The government tracks all sorts of jobs figures, but who keeps tabs on hopelessness?

Broun used this statistic days earlier. When the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the U.S. Department of Labor’s official keeper of the nation’s jobs data, released its November employment figures Dec. 2, he issued a press release criticizing the Obama administration.

""Today’s job report paints a clear picture of how thoroughly this Administration’s policies have failed,"" Broun’s release said. ""While the addition of 120,000 net jobs appears to be good news, what it hides is that 315,000 Americans have now simply given up looking for work, and are no longer counted in these unemployment figures.""  

We called Broun’s office for more information, but received no response during the winter break.

So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. We discovered that our federal government does track people who despair of finding a job.

Each month, the bureau publishes a report with key labor data such as unemployment figures and the size of the workforce. It also includes a monthly count of what the bureau classifies as ""discouraged workers.""

These are people who want to find a job and are available to take one, but have given up because they think there are no jobs, or none for which they would qualify.

We looked at data for November 2011, the most recent numbers available when Broun issued his press release. They show that there were fewer discouraged workers than the year before, but their ranks had grown from the previous month.

There were some 1.1 million discouraged workers in November, which was down by about 186,000 from a year earlier and up about 133,000 from a month earlier.

Whether you consider discouraged workers on a year-to-year or month-to-month basis, Broun’s figure is way off the mark.  

Since Broun wasn’t available for a response, we searched the Internet for possible sources of his data. We found an Associated Press story that said that ""a key reason the unemployment rate fell so much was because roughly 315,000 people had given up looking for work and were no longer counted as unemployed.""

USA Today, National Public Radio and other news outlets posted the story or excerpts on their web sites.

We found that the size of the civilian labor force, or the number of employed and unemployed non-military workers, did shrink by 315,000 people, according to the BLS data.

But this does not mean that they dropped out of the job market because they thought they couldn’t find work, explained Gary Steinberg, a spokesman for the bureau.

Some might have left the labor force to care for a sick relative. Others might have retired. Or the working-age population might have decreased.

Broun was apparently led astray by credible news outlets, but the figure is still wrong. November’s unemployment numbers did not show that ""nearly 315,000 Americans have simply given up hope when it comes to finding a job.""

The ranks of discouraged workers had actually declined by about 186,000 since November 2010, and risen by about 133,000 since October. This means he’s off by hundreds of thousands of workers, no matter how you count it.

"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims New Jersey has fewer state employees than when former Gov. Christie Whitman left office in 2001
","
Private-sector jobs in New Jersey may be on the rise, but the number of state government employees is lower than it was nearly 11 years ago.

During a Dec. 20 interview on MSNBC’s Morning Joe, Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, pointed to that statistic and other achievements as examples of what he’s been able to accomplish in the face of a Democratic-controlled Legislature.

""And, as of today, New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001,"" Christie told hosts Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski. ""So, we’ve made government smaller. We’ve made it smarter. We’ve made it less expensive for people. And we’ve done that with a Democratic Legislature.""

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie’s numbers are solid.

Based on the latest preliminary statistics from state and federal officials, the number of ""state government"" workers dropped to 137,800 in November, which represents 600 fewer employees than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman resigned in January 2001.

Let’s break down the figures.

When Whitman stepped down to become head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, there were 138,400 state workers, according to seasonally adjusted figures from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

By the time Christie took office in January 2010, the number of state government employees had increased to 151,900, marking a jump of nearly 10 percent since January 2001.

As of November of this year, the number of state workers had fallen during Christie’s tenure by 14,100, or about 9.3 percent. When compared to Whitman’s final month in office, the decline is a more modest 0.4 percent, or 600 workers, but nevertheless, it’s still a reduction.

Those statistics include workers in state departments; the legislative and judicial branches; state colleges and universities; state hospitals and state authorities and commissions, such as NJ Transit. But these figures don’t account for public employees in municipal and county governments, and local school districts.

Between the executive, legislative and judicial branches, the number of state employees has dropped by about 4,738 from when Christie took office to November, state officials said. Most of the staff reductions have been due to retirements, with only 743 positions eliminated through layoffs, officials said.

""As to attrition, there has been a concerted effort by the administration to shrink the size of state government, which had grown too large and costly. At the same time, the Governor has insisted that departments be efficient and effective in the delivery of services,"" Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak said in an email. ""As we all know as well by now, fiscal realities have required painful budgeting decisions at the same time.""

The wave of retirements comes at a time when state officials have been demanding greater contributions from public-sector workers toward their benefits.

Hetty Rosenstein, state director of the Communication Workers of America, the largest union representing state workers, attributed the retirements to employees’ concerns over benefits and the age of the workforce

The reduction began with hiring freezes under former Gov. Jon Corzine, Rosenstein said.

""It is an aging workforce,"" Rosenstein said. ""This is essentially attrition....This is all to be expected.""

Rutgers labor professor Jeff Keefe also said a ""great deal of anxiety about benefits"" is driving the retirements. When Christie took office, most public workers got the message that the state was facing significant long-term fiscal problems, Keefe said.

Our ruling

In a television interview, Christie claimed ""New Jersey state government has less employees than when Christie Whitman left office in 2001.""

The governor’s right, according to the latest preliminary labor statistics. By November, there were 600 fewer state workers than when Whitman stepped down in January 2001.

We rate the statement True.

U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder says more voters were registered at Rhode Island social services agencies after a lawsuit against the state than in the prior two years
","
President Obama has made it clear that he believes in the importance of the Voting Rights Act. His administration has signaled its intent to enforce the federal act as states make changes to their laws to require voters to present identification before casting ballots.

In a recent speech in Austin, Texas, U.S. Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said the Department of Justice is reviewing recent changes to state laws to determine whether they comply with the Voting Rights Act. Speaking at the presidential library of Lyndon B. Johnson, who signed the landmark act into law in 1965, Holder said that his agency is obligated to ensure the country’s election systems are free of discrimination and are more, not less, accessible to citizens.

He cited the outcome of one lawsuit as an example of the effectiveness of the Justice Department’s work in enforcing the Voting Rights Act.

""For example, after filing a lawsuit in Rhode Island, we reached an agreement with state agencies that resulted in more voters being registered in the first full month after our lawsuit than in the entire previous two-year reporting period,"" Holder said in the Dec. 13 speech.

More voters registered in Rhode Island in a single month than in the previous two years? Really?

First, some context. This year, a slew of states passed controversial new voting laws in an effort, according to proponents, to combat fraud.

Critics, however, say the laws, which require voters to present identification before casting ballots, will deter the poor and minorities from voting.

The list includes Rhode Island. Under the state’s new law, starting in 2012, voters will have to show some form of identification. By 2014, they will have to show a valid photo ID, or cast provisional ballots that will only count if their signatures match their voter registration cards.

In the speech, Holder referred to the many new voter identification laws enacted around the country, but, to be clear, the lawsuit against Rhode Island had nothing to do with that issue. In fact, Rhode Island’s law was passed by the General Assembly and signed into law by Governor Chafee after the federal lawsuit was resolved.

We contacted the Justice Department, which gave us some information on the lawsuit.

Under the 1993 National Voter Registration Act, all states are required to provide voter registration at motor vehicle departments and at state agencies that offer public assistance programs or programs for people with disabilities. The aim of the law, which came to be known as ""Motor Voter,"" is to offer low-income citizens the same ability to participate in elections as more affluent Americans.

The lawsuit, filed March 18, 2011, by the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division, alleged that four Rhode Island state agencies failed to provide voter registration and therefore failed to comply with the federal law. The agencies are the Department of Human Services, the Department of Health, the Executive Office of Health and Human Services and the Department of Behavioral Healthcare, Developmental Disabilities and Hospitals.

In an interview, Robert Kando, executive director of the Rhode Island Board of Elections, said that although voter registration at the Division of Motor Vehicles has been thriving -- more new voters are registered there than anywhere else in the state -- the four social services agencies had indeed failed to offer voter registration to people who had applied for services.

He attributed the failing to the departure of the employee at the Board of Elections who supervised the program. That person’s duties were passed on to another worker, but monitoring of the four agencies somehow fell through the cracks and the number of voter registrations dropped, said Kando.

On March 25, just a week after the lawsuit was filed, the state and the Justice Department reached an agreement to resuscitate the program and improve supervision of voter registration efforts at the agencies. At the heart of the consent decree is an order for workers at the agencies to distribute voter registration forms with each application for services, recertification, renewal or change of address request. Under the two-year agreement, the state is also required to supply the Justice Department with voter registration numbers from the agencies.

It was those numbers that Holder used as the basis for his claim in the speech in Texas. Kando gave us the same numbers.

In the two-year reporting period before the lawsuit was filed, a total of 457 voter registration forms were submitted by the four social services agencies.

The lawsuit was filed in March 2011, so the first full month afterward was April. The Board of Elections received 1,038 voter registration forms that month from the four agencies. That’s more than twice as many as in 2009 and 2010 combined.

Out of curiosity, we asked Kando what registrations at the agencies have been like since April. In May, 1,346 voter registration forms were filed, followed by 891 in June and 896 in July.

Kando said that he would expect the numbers to drop because the agencies have many repeat visitors. But it’s clear that many voters have been signed up at the agencies since the lawsuit.

Our ruling

This one’s pretty straightforward. In his speech, Holder said that more voters were registered in the first month after the Justice Department filed a lawsuit against Rhode Island for violations of the National Voter Registration Act than in the two years beforehand.

Our research confirmed Holder’s numbers.

We vote for a ruling of True on this claim.

Has Rick Perry toughened his abortion stance?
","
At a Rick Perry presidential campaign event in Iowa on Dec. 27, 2011, a pastor told the Texas governor that he saw a contradiction in Perry's abortion stance. 
Pointing to a conversation he had with Perry at an October event, the Rev. Joshua Verwers of Full Faith Christian Center in Chariton, Iowa, said the governor had characterized his position as in favor of banning abortion except in cases of rape, incest or when a woman's life is in danger. ""But just about a week ago, you signed the Personhood USA pledge, which ... states that abortion and the innocent killing of all life should always be prohibited and that it's never acceptable,"" Verwers said. ""So to me it seems kind of like a contradiction (from) where you were a month ago."" 
Perry responded by telling the pastor that he had undergone a transformation. Afterward, many news outlets reported that Perry had shifted his position on abortion rights. We decided to put that question to the PolitiFact Flip-O-Meter. Has Perry toughened his stance on abortion? 
First, we checked whether Verwers had accurately characterized Perry's established position on abortion. We should note that Perry said, ""Yes, sir,"" several times while Verwers was speaking to him at the Iowa event, including after the pastor's statement that Perry had previously expressed support for the three exceptions to any abortion ban. 
In a search of news articles, we found support for Verwers' description of Perry's position going back to 1997. 
An Aug. 31, 2011, Texas Tribune story said Perry ""opposes abortion except in cases of rape or incest, or when the mother's life is in danger."" 
A Jan. 12, 2007, Austin American-Statesman article reported that Perry, in an interview with a reporter, said he was amenable to a proposal that would trigger a state ban on abortions if the U.S. Supreme Court were to reverse the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Perry told the reporter that he favored exceptions to the ban to save a woman's life and in cases of rape and incest. 
A year earlier, when Perry was running for re-election, the Dallas Morning News published responses from the candidates to questions about abortion issues and contraception. Among the questions was: ""Should abortion be legal in cases of rape, incest and to protect the life of the woman?"" Perry's response was listed as ""yes."" 
Jumping back nearly 10 years, a June 19, 1997, news article by the American-Statesman — reporting on the announcement that Perry, then the state agriculture commissioner, would run for lieutenant governor — said Perry told reporters that he was opposed to abortion except in cases involving rape, incest or a threat to the life of the woman. 
So, has Perry's position on ""exceptions"" changed? 
On Dec. 27, 2011, during the Iowa event, Perry told Verwers that his transformation came after watching the film Gift of Life, whose website says it ""looks at the lives of individuals who were nearly the victims of an abortion,"" and talking with Rebecca Kiessling, a woman who was conceived during a rape. ""I really started giving some thought about the issue of rape and incest,"" Perry said. 
Later that night, Perry participated in a teleconference sponsored by Personhood USA, the group behind the pledge that Verwers mentioned in his question to Perry, and other anti-abortion organizations. Perry acknowledged that his position had changed. ""This is something that is relatively new,"" Perry said, again citing his conversation with Kiessling. ""We had a fairly lengthy and heartfelt conversation about how she was conceived in rape, and looking in her eyes, I couldn’t come up with an answer to defend the exceptions for rape and incest,"" Perry said. 
In a phone interview, we asked Verwers how he had interpreted Perry's response to his question. Verwers said he believed that Perry was telling him that he no longer believed in any of the three exceptions he had expressed support for previously. 
""My interpretation is that he is wholeheartedly in support of the Personhood USA pledge that says there is never an acceptable case for abortion,"" Verwers said. ""I think he's truly committed to that, no matter the case, no matter the exception."" 
The pledge, which Perry signed Dec. 15, says: ""I believe that in order to properly protect the right to life of the vulnerable among us, every human being at every stage of development must be recognized as a person possessing the right to life in federal and state laws without exception and without compromise."" However, it also says this, suggesting some ambiguity when it comes to the ""life of the mother"" exception: ""I recognize that in cases where a mother's life is at risk, every effort should be made to save the baby's life as well; leaving the death of an innocent child an unintended tragedy rather than an intentional killing."" 
On Dec. 28, a day after talking about his transformation with Verwers, Perry told reporters outside a restaurant in Indianola, Iowa, that he continues to support one exception to an abortion ban: in cases in which a woman's life is threatened. 
""So the lone exception is now for the life of the mother?"" a reporter asked. ""That's correct,"" Perry said. 
Our ruling 
Perry has long maintained his opposition to most abortions while supporting exceptions in cases of rape, incest and when a woman's life is threatened. Now, he says he is in favor of only one exception. 
That's a change in position, but it's short of a Full Flop. We'll call it a Half Flip.",/factchecks/2011/dec/28/rick-perry/has-rick-perry-toughened-his-abortion-stance/

Ad credits Newt Gingrich with balancing the budget
","
A TV ad airing in Iowa in the final week before the caucuses calls Newt Gingrich a ""principled conservative"" who has ""fought for us.""

Here’s how: ""Newt balanced the federal budget, reformed welfare, cut taxes and created 11 million new jobs,"" a man’s voice says as photos of Gingrich flash on the screen.

The ad was produced the week of Dec. 26, 2011, by a group called Winning Our Future, a ""super PAC"" that can raise money for elections but isn’t formally affiliated with any candidate. Winning Our Future is clearly pro-Gingrich, stating on its website that its goal is to make him the Republican nominee for president.

The ad makes several claims. Here, we’re focusing on the assertion that Gingrich balanced the federal budget.

We’ve previously reported that there were indeed budget surpluses during his time as speaker of the House, from 1995 to 1999. By fiscal year 1998, the federal budget did reach a surplus of $69 billion. And in fiscal year 1999 -- which Gingrich can claim some responsibility for, even though he was out as speaker for most of the fiscal year -- it was in surplus as well, to the tune of $126 billion.

So our main question is, how much credit does Gingrich deserve?

We asked several experts who said it's a stretch to credit Gingrich alone because there were many forces and people at work in bringing the government to a balanced budget.

The primary one: a booming economy.

""The budget ended up balancing faster than either party expected simply because economic growth was so strong,"" said Chris Edwards, an economist at the libertarian Cato Institute. ""I don’t think either party had much to do with that.""

He does credit Gingrich for pushing President Bill Clinton toward reducing the deficit.

In his 1996 budget, ""Clinton proposed to stabilize the deficit at around $190 billion. He did not propose to balance the budget. The Republicans under Gingrich pushed him into it,"" Edwards said, and that materialized in the Balanced Budget Act of 1997.

Stan Collender, a former Democratic staffer for the House and Senate budget committees, was less generous about crediting Gingrich.

""It happened on his watch but it doesn’t mean that he gets credit for it,"" said Collender. ""The only thing you can give him credit for is stalling some additional spending programs.""

Collender agreed that the balanced budget was more a result of ""a soaring economy, with capital gains taxes coming in, and the tech bubble than it had anything to do with legislation.""

Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said Gingrich is simply doing what politicians do.

""He’s just kind of ignoring that there was anybody else in Washington doing anything about the budget, which is kind of in a politician’s DNA,"" Ellis said.

Another factor Ellis cited is the 1993 tax increase that Clinton pushed through, over Gingrich’s and all other House Republicans’ objections. Tax increases generated more revenue, which led to surpluses.

""It’s not necessarily the spending differential, it’s the revenue differential,"" Ellis said.

Stuart Rothenberg, editor of the Rothenberg Political Report, summed up the ad’s claim this way:

""The idea that one person, in this case Gingrich, is responsible for a balanced budget seems far-fetched at best and, frankly, pretty silly. Ever hear of checks and balances?""

Our ruling

Winning Our Future’s ad says, ""Newt balanced the federal budget.""

Gingrich was House speaker in 1998, the first year of the surplus, and he can be given some credit for the 1999 surplus, even though he was out of Congress for most of that fiscal year.

Even so, simply being speaker during the surplus years doesn’t mean that the balanced budget was his doing. He pushed for it, yes. But other factors like Clinton’s 1993 tax increase -- which Gingrich opposed -- were at work, too. And our experts agreed that a booming economy, generating millions more revenue, was the single most important factor, and one that no politician can take credit for.

Obama campaign says half of the benefit from Newt Gingrich's tax plan goes to top 1 percent
","
President Barack Obama’s campaign managers spoke the language of the Occupy Wall Street movement last week when they took aim at the tax plan introduced by Republican candidate Newt Gingrich.

""Speaker Gingrich supports the Republican budget plan that would … provide more tax breaks to millionaires, billionaires and large corporations and make the middle class foot the bill,"" Obama spokesman Ben LaBolt said Tuesday, Dec. 20, 2011, in a conference call with New Hampshire reporters.

""Fifty percent of Speaker Gingrich’s tax plan goes to the top 1 percent,"" LaBolt said. (We're following our practice of attributing this claim to Obama because LaBolt was acting as a spokesman for the campaign, not speaking on his own.)

Gingrich’s tax plan would cut the corporate income tax in half and would introduce a 15 percent flat tax option for all taxpayers. But would 50 percent of the benefits really go to the top 1 percent of income earners?

To find the answer, the Obama campaign's press office pointed us to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington that recently issued a report analyzing the Gingrich tax plan.

The Tax Policy Center, which has also evaluated proposals by Rick Perry and Herman Cain, among others, concluded that Gingrich’s plan would reduce total U.S. tax revenues by as much as 35 percent by 2015, the first full year the plan could be implemented. But analysts made a number of assumptions to reach these figures.

First, the report assumed that those U.S. taxpayers who would see lower tax bills under Gingrich’s flat tax option, about 70 percent of taxpayers, would enroll in the plan.

Also, the report assumes that tax policies currently in place, including the Bush-era tax cuts, will be extended at least through 2015. That's based on the predictions of most analysts, who expect Congress to continue extending them. (The center’s calculations do not, however, include the current payroll tax cut, which Gingrich has said he would phase out.)

It’s this second assumption that is key to the Obama administration’s 50 percent figure.

If the Bush cuts and other current tax policies are allowed to expire, then the Gingrich plan would cut tax revenues by about $1.3 trillion in 2015, and the top 1 percent of income earners would receive 41.6 percent of those savings, paying an average of $422,298 less in taxes.

Under these parameters, the bottom 20 percent of income earners would take in 1 percent of the total savings, paying an average of $289 less, according to the center's calculations.

Assuming, however, that the current tax policies continue, as most analysts suggest, the Gingrich plan would cut tax revenues by about $850 million by 2015, and about half of those savings would fall to the top 1 percent, the report concludes.

Under the plan, the top earners would pay an average of $340,203 in tax under Gingrich’s plan, making up 50.1 percent of the total tax cuts. By contrast, the lowest 20 percent of income earners would pay an average of $63 less, comprising less than 1 percent of the total savings.

""The wealthy get far and away the biggest benefits"" of the Gingrich plan, said Roberton Williams, an analyst at the Tax Policy Center.

To this point, Chris Edwards, tax policy director at the libertarian Cato Institute, notes that many such tax reform plans appear to benefit the wealthiest Americans because they are already paying taxes at a much higher rate.

Currently, the top 1 percent of income earners are paying tax rates as high as 35 percent. The average federal rate for that group is 29.8 percent. Under Gingrich’s plan, it would fall to 12.8 percent, according to the Tax Policy Center report. The average federal tax rate for the lowest 20 percent of income earners would fall from 2 percent to 1.4 percent. 
Edwards said that would correct the current disparity that makes the wealthy shoulder too large a tax burden. ""Even with the Gingrich cut, the people at the top end are still going to be paying substantially higher rates.""

The benefits to the country’s top earners don’t stop with the tax rate, however, Williams points out. Among other elements of the tax plan, Gingrich also proposes to eliminate taxes on capital gains, dividends and interest, among others. He says they are ""the winners"" of the Gingrich plan.

Representatives from the Gingrich campaign didn’t return requests for comment this week. But, campaign staff told CNN Money that the Tax Policy Center analysis didn’t take into consideration the economic growth likely to result from the tax plan. They said the tax plan is part of a larger 10-year plan to balance the federal budget.

Williams, of the Tax Policy Center, acknowledged that his analysis does not factor in economic growth, because that is difficult to calculate, he said. But, with the loss of $850 billion in tax revenue, the economy would have to grow at an extreme and unlikely rate to make up the losses, Williams said.

""Economists generally agree that cutting taxes and making them flatter will improve economic growth. The question we disagree on is how much faster it will grow,"" he said. ""It’s hard to see how the economy will grow fast enough to make up all the revenue losses.""

Our ruling

The Obama campaign said ""50 percent of Speaker Gingrich’s tax plan goes to the top 1 percent.""

The analysis of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center backs up that claim -- as long as current tax policies continue, which is what most analysts expect. As long as they are, the country’s wealthiest 1 percent would indeed receive about half of the savings under Gingrich’s plan.

Still, the share would fall to 41.6 percent if the Bush cuts and other current tax policies are allowed to expire. That isn't likely to happen, but Congress will have to act to extend them.

Pro-Romney super PAC says New Gingrich supports amnesty for illegal immigrants
","
A pro-Mitt Romney ""super PAC"" is flexing its muscles in the race for the Republican presidential nomination, telling conservative voters not to fall for President Barack Obama’s plan to diminish Romney. The group, called Restore our Future, is running television ads in Iowa and Florida.

""Barack Obama’s plan is working: Destroy Mitt Romney, run against Newt Gingrich,"" the ad says. ""Newt has a ton of baggage. He was fined $300,000 for ethics violations and took $1.6 million from Freddie Mac, before it helped cause the economic meltdown. Newt supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, and teamed with Nancy Pelosi and Al Gore on global warming. Maybe that’s why George Will calls him the least conservative candidate. Check the facts at NewtFacts.com.""

Super PACs aren’t formally affiliated with campaigns, but they can still spend money to try to influence elections, and they don’t face the same disclosure requirements as official campaigns. In this case, Restore our Future is run by supporters of Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts.

The ad makes a lot of claims. Here, we wanted to check whether Gingrich ""supports amnesty for illegal immigrants.""

We looked into Gingrich’s position on amnesty when we fact-checked comments Romney made on Nov. 23, 2011. Romney said Gingrich’s immigration plan offered ""a new doorway to amnesty."" We rated that Mostly True. And in fact, the Restore Our Future ad cites that fact-check as evidence to support its claim.  But the wording in this ad is slightly different.

To examine it, we’ll review Gingrich’s positions on illegal immigration and amnesty, then we’ll see how that record compares with the ad’s statement.

Merriam Webster defines amnesty as ""the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals.""

In recent American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an ""amnesty"" program, both then and now.

Gingrich’s vision for immigration policy is that it takes place in steps, with the first step of securing the border between the U.S. and Mexico. He also supports a program for guest workers, to allow foreign nationals into the United States to work. Finally, some illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay.

""Once you've put every piece in place, which includes the guest worker program, you need something like a World War II Selective Service Board that, frankly, reviews the people who are here,"" Gingrich said at a debate on Nov. 22, 2011. ""If you've come here recently, you have no ties to this country, you ought to go home, period. If you've been here 25 years and you got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, (and) you belong to a local church, I don't think we're going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out.

""The Krieble Foundation has a very good red card program that says you get to be legal, but you don't get a pass to citizenship. And so there's a way to ultimately end up with a country where there's no more illegality, but you haven't automatically given amnesty to anyone.""

Gingrich sets a higher bar for allowing people to stay than the law under Reagan. Based on his comments at the debate and a detailed 10-point plan on his website, Gingrich says his proposal isn’t amnesty for several reasons: It is not citizenship but legal residency; immigrants would have to prove ""deep ties to America, including family, church and community ties""; and they would pay a fine of at least $5,000.

In the course of our research, we noticed that advocates for more legal immigration often used this distinction. In their view, amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria.

Romney, on the other hand, has defined amnesty as giving any kind of special preference to people who are now in the country illegally.

""My view is that those people who have waited in line patiently to come to this country legally should be ahead in line, and those who’ve come here illegally should not be given a special deal or a special accelerated right to become a permanent resident or citizen,"" Romney said the day after the debate.

Those who oppose more immigration tend to agree with Romney.

""Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, when we asked him about this for our earlier check.

After the debate, Krikorian scolded Gingrich in a blog post on the National Review Online for claiming his plan wasn’t amnesty: ""If you want to make a case for amnestying long-established illegal aliens, that can be an honorable position, but call it for what it is. Don’t lie to voters, imagining they’re too stupid to see through your deceit.""

On the other side of the issue is Tamar Jacoby of ImmigrationWorks USA, which represents businesses that favor more immigration. She said Gingrich’s avoidance of the loaded term amnesty was understandable, since his plan is limited and requires illegal immigrants to meet various requirements.

She praised Gingrich for his honesty. ""He’s getting pilloried for saying we can’t deport 11 million people,"" she said. ""At least Newt is saying, ‘There’s a problem here, let’s come to grips with it.’""

When Romney has been asked about what he would do with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants who are already in the country, Romney has stopped short of urging mass deportation.

""You know, there's great interest on the part of some to talk about what we do with the 11 million. My interest is saying, let's make sure that we secure the border, and we don't do anything that talks about bringing in a new wave of those or attracting a new wave of people into the country illegally,"" Romney said in an interview with Fox News on Nov. 29, 2011. 
Our ruling

""Amnesty"" has become a radioactive term in American politics, and Republicans in particular do not want their immigration policies described that way. Gingrich supports allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for many years to apply for legal status. He’s said that process should look at each individual and whether they have ""family, church and community ties."" They would also have to pay a fine. What he describes sounds like a more restrictive process than the 1986 law supported by Reagan that allowed for widespread amnesty.

Still, most legal amnesties include some sort of process. Gingrich’s plan is clearly an amnesty of sorts, though it is more limited in scope.

The ad says Gingrich ""supports amnesty for illegal immigrants."" That’s a blunter claim than the statement we rated previously from Romney, that Gingrich’s plan is ""a new doorway to amnesty."" Romney’s comment implied that there was something new about Gingrich’s plan rather than being the same amnesty policies of the past. The ad, on the other hand, loses that nuance. So we rate its claim Half True.",/factchecks/2011/dec/27/restore-our-future/pro-romney-super-pac-says-new-gingrich-supports-am/
"['Gambling', 'Florida', 'Ellyn Bogdanoff']","
Ellyn Bogdanoff said 'Florida is considered the fourth-largest gambling state in the nation'
","
Supporters of a proposed bill that would allow three massive destination casino resorts in South Florida often argue that gambling is already a big business here -- in fact, one of the largest in the country.

""Florida is considered the fourth-largest gambling state in the nation, but it has let the industry drive policy decisions and that has produced the worst kind of gaming,'' Sen. Ellyn Bogdanoff, R-Fort Lauderdale, said in an October 2011 interview about her casinos bill. ""To me, no kind of gaming is good, but we as policymakers have to decide, do we want gaming with five-star hotels or Internet cafes in strip malls?""

That fourth-largest ranking claim has been repeated multiple times by Bogdanoff, including in a joint editorial with state Rep. Erik Fresen, R-Miami, and by other individuals, including former U.S. Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart. Diaz-Balart is a lawyer and adviser for the Genting Group, which has purchased the waterfront Miami Herald property with plans to build a mega casino-resort there.

We wondered if the ranking is true.

 The roots of the claim

Bogdanoff's legislative assistant, Aaron Nevins, told us that the source of her claim came from a Oct. 24, 2011, report by Bernstein Research, a leading watcher of gambling stocks.

""Florida has more gaming options than Las Vegas,"" the report states. ""There is currently $3.4B of gaming occurring in Florida or $7.4B if one includes the lottery ... There are 8 casinos in the state run by Native Americans. Seven of these are Seminole and one is Miccosukee. These casinos generated revenues of just over $2B in 2009, making Florida the fourth largest state for tribal gaming....""

Setting aside the numbers for a second, the Bernstein report makes clear it is discussing tribal gaming not gaming overall in that section, a distinction not made by Bogdanoff.

""She misspoke,"" Nevins told PolitiFact in a Dec. 20 interview. ""Florida is the fourth-largest state for tribal gaming.""

Other measures, rankings

What else is out there?

We asked Nevins if there were any other sources that ranked states' gambling revenues -- and he quickly found a separate report about states' gambling revenues in fiscal year 2010 by the Nelson A. Rockefeller Institute of Government, a group that describes itself as the public policy research arm of the State University of New York.

According to the Rockefeller report, 43 states operate lotteries, 15 allow commercial casinos, 12 have racinos, and over 40 states allow pari-mutuel wagering. Lotteries and casinos generate the bulk of gambling-related revenues.

The report on Page 5 compares states' revenues from lotteries, casinos, racinos and traditional pari-mutuel wagering. In Florida, revenues totaled about $1.4 billion -- ranking the state third behind New York and Pennsylvania.

The group also found that -- in the states where data was available -- Florida ranked third in Native American casino revenues, behind California and Connecticut.

(A brief pit stop here to explain why the Bernstein and Rockefeller reports were billions apart on their Florida figures. The Rockefeller report cited about $1.25 billion for the lottery, which is the amount that went to the state's Education Enhancement Trust Fund, while Bernstein cited total lottery revenues of about $4 billion. Those figures can be seen in this chart on page 117 from Florida's Department of Economic and Demographic Research.)

Now, back to the Rockefeller chart showing Florida at No. 3. How could Florida be ahead of Nevada, which had $829.3 million in revenues, placing at No. 12? This chart looks at gambling revenues from four sources -- lotteries, casinos, racinos and pari-mutuel wagering -- combined. Nevada only has one category here -- casinos -- while Florida has the lottery, racinos (race tracks with slot machines) and pari-mutuel wagering.

But let's take a look at a few other charts in the Rockefeller report that examine states' gambling rankings in various ways:

* States' reliance on gambling revenues: In fiscal year 2009, Florida was 15th at 3.3 percent. Nevada -- at 12.5 percent -- had the highest percentage of gambling revenue as a share of the state's own-source revenue.

* States' share of nationwide gambling revenues: Florida was third at 5.8 percent behind New York and Pennsylvania for fiscal year 2010. 
* Gambling revenue per resident 18 & above: Florida was 21st at $94.4. Rhode Island was No. 1. 
* Gambling revenue as a percentage of personal income: Florida was 19th at 0.2 percent. West Virginia was No. 1.

And there are even more charts in the report that compare gambling revenues between 2009 and 2010 and zero in on single sources of gambling such as racinos. But you get the picture -- each measure of gambling can result in a different state being the top, second or fourth.

And we'll toss in one more source of state-by-state comparisons. We found a ranking of states related to commercial casino activity from the American Gaming Association's 2011 state of the states survey.

For example, on state-by-state consumer spending, or gross gaming revenue -- what a casino earns before it pays taxes, salaries or other expenses, Florida ranked 16th in the country. On tax revenue, Florida ranked 15th. (The AGA is focused here on its definition of commercial casinos, which includes racinos -- but note these rankings don't reflect tribal establishments or the lottery.)

And if you guessed Nevada as No. 1 for commercial casino tax revenue you'd be wrong -- Pennsylvania and Indiana were higher. How could Indiana be higher than Nevada?

""Indiana ranks higher than Nevada because, while its gross gaming revenue is lower than Nevada, its tax rate is much higher, yielding a larger tax contribution from commercial casinos in the state,"" said Holly Wetzel, spokeswoman for the association.

Check out this article from Stateline.org, a publication of the Pew Center on the States:

""Nevada can still lay claim to being the nation’s leading casino state, with a total take of $10.4 billion last year, but casino revenue and casino tax revenue are two very different things. State tax policies for casinos vary widely. Tax rates often are higher for casinos located at racetracks, sometimes called 'racinos,' where the slot machines tend to be operated by the state lottery as opposed to the more traditional state regulatory gaming commission.""

 What's the best source?

So is there a preferred way to compare states to conclude which one is the largest, or fourth-largest, gambling state in the nation? Does it all depend on what point you want to make or what you are looking at?

We posed those questions to experts in the industry as well as academics.

Wetzel, of AGA, told us in an interview: ""I don't think there is a right or wrong or agreed-upon way to measure it. It depends upon what question you are asking."" Wetzel said most firms comparing markets look at gross gaming revenues -- what a casino earns before it pays taxes, salaries or other expenses. It can also be useful to look at tax contributions -- but there are different tax rates in various states.

""You can slice it and dice it anyway you want to depending on what story you are wanting to get at,"" Wetzel said. ""The way we rank it is gross gaming revenue.""

Lucy Dadayan, one of the authors on the Rockefeller report, agreed with Bogdanoff that gambling is already in Florida in a big way.

""However, the statement by the senator isn’t made in terms of reliance on gambling, or on any adjusted basis,"" Dadayan told PolitiFact Florida in an e-mail. ""So total gambling expenditures (which we don’t collect) is the best measure in that regard. From the figures we collect, I’d say total gambling revenues to the state are the most useful measure, and Florida is in the 3rd place by this measure. The choice of the measure is really dependent on the purpose of the comparison.""

Dean Gerstein, principal investigator for an in-depth gambling study done for the federal government in 1999 and now vice provost and professor at Claremont Graduate University, said the best measure depends on the point a person is trying to make.

""A measure is a statistical construct designed to best match the concept you have in mind. If the concept is the sheer size of an industry, then total revenues/sales is the usual metric,"" Gerstein said. ""If it is the significance of the industry to the 'local' economy, it is the industry’s local wages plus locally retained profits (including the tax rake) generated, as a percentage of local wage/profit retention/tax.

""If you are interested in gambling by residents, you want to know how much the local residents gamble away per capita, regardless of where they do so. Hence all the CA residents who trek to Vegas are exporting money. But all the multinational corporations that own Vegas casinos are exporting profits. The preferred stat depends on what you are interested in, and it is important to think straight about this. Note that the states with the largest populations — CA, TX, NY, FL — tend to dominate any stat that is based in some part on total population, while Nevada and other small-pop mountain states will be down in the weeds. When you put population in the denominator (that is, 'per capita'), that changes things.""

 Our ruling

As Bogdanoff introduced her casino bill she said: ""Florida is considered the fourth-largest gambling state in the nation..."" But this isn't as simple as college football rankings. There isn't one universally accepted measure.

Now, Bogdanoff's legislative assistant acknowledges she should have specified tribal gaming. But that said, Bogdanoff's broader point is certainly supported from the majority of research, which suggests that -- if you include the state lottery -- Florida is certainly a big gambling state. No. 4? That's a lot less clear and very much dependent on what you measure and how you measure it.
