Lloyd Doggett says Homeland Security only federal agency not funded through 2015 fiscal year
","In a commentary, U.S. Rep. Lloyd Doggett of Austin criticized border-security legislation advanced by a fellow U.S. House member at a time that funding for the Department of Homeland Security seems stand-alone shaky. Doggett, a Democrat, said the Border Security Results Act offered by Austin’s Michael McCaul, the Republican chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee, was premised on the unattainable goal of no unauthorized border crossers, making for a border tighter than that of North Korea. Moreover, Doggett wrote in his article posted online Jan. 26, 2015, by the Austin American-Statesman: ""Our border security is being further undermined by Republican limitations on DHS law enforcement funding. This is the only federal department not funded for this entire fiscal year. Uncertain stop-and-start, short-term appropriations weaken the ability to plan at a time of heightened international security concerns."" We think of Uncle Sam as gigantic, sprawling, multi-digited. Is Homeland Security all alone in going unfunded through the fiscal year running through September 2015? Doggett’s factual backup By email, Doggett spokeswoman Leslie Tisdale cited a Dec. 10, 2014, Congressional Quarterly news story referring to 11 spending measures that had made it through Congress with only a ""continuing resolution"" approved to maintain Homeland Security funding for a few months. And on Dec. 16, 2014, she noted, the White House announced President Barack Obama had signed into law the Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act of 2015, ""which provides fiscal year 2015 full-year appropriations through September 30, 2015, for all agencies except the Department of Homeland Security, for which appropriations are provided instead through February 27, 2015."" Congressional actions Then again, news accounts suggest there’s room for Homeland Security funding to be worked out. In early 2015, the Republican-majority House advanced a measure funding Homeland Security through the fiscal year. A Jan. 9, 2015, press release from the House Appropriations Committee said the fiscal 2015 Homeland Security funding measure, described as the ""last of the 12 annual funding bills to be considered,"" included $39.7 billion in discretionary funding, an increase of $400 million compared with what lawmakers ponied up the previous year. Under the proposal, funding would flow to Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, cybersecurity, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the release said. But the appropriation had a catch. Five days later, the House voted mostly along party lines to tie the funding to reversing Obama’s immigration actions, though news accounts said it was unlikely sufficient senators would agree to the linkage and even if that improbably happened, Obama would veto the measure. ""House approval of the spending bill was just the opening act in a debate expected to stretch into late February, when funding for the Department of Homeland Security is set to expire,"" the Washington Post reported. A Jan. 15, 2015, New York Times news story hinted the issue would be worked out. ""Because Republicans have said that they will use the $40 billion funding bill for the Department of Homeland Security as their vehicle for dismantling"" Obama’s immigration actions, the story said, ""Congress faces another deadline that seems likely to force an accommodation before the department's money is due to run out at the end of February."" ""One disagreement Republicans will have to work out is how far they are willing to go to push legislation that has no chance of becoming law--because it dies either in the Senate or in a presidential veto,"" the Times story said. ""It is clear that some House Republicans want--and expect--the Senate to be as unyielding as they have been, though that is not likely. Asked how far he was willing to go, Rep. Trent Franks of Arizona said, '’All the way to where we fail to override.’"" ""If the feud lingers beyond Feb. 27 with no compromise and Homeland Security funding runs out,"" the Times’ story said, ""millions of federal employees within the department's vast bureaucracy will have to work without pay. Around 85 percent of the department is classified as ‘essential’ and must report to work regardless of whether their agency is effectively shut down. This includes Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration screeners,"" the story said. We asked Homeland Security if more details had been revealed about what happens after Feb. 27 and didn’t draw any. Independent confirmation Separately, a budget expert told us Doggett got it right. By email to our inquiry, Jack Deutsch of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a nonprofit committed to educating the public about issues with significant fiscal policy impact, said that one of its policy advisers, Ed Lorenzen, noted that at the end of 2014, Congress passed legislation, referred to as the CRomnibus, providing funding for all federal agencies except Homeland Security for all of fiscal 2015 ""but only continuing funding for the Homeland Security appropriations through Feb. 27."" Our ruling Doggett said Homeland Security is ""the only federal department not funded for the entire year"" by Congress. That was so as of when Doggett spoke in January 2015. Congressional Republicans were attempting to tie funding through the fiscal year to a repeal of Obama’s 2014 announcement the administration intended to shield some unauthorized immigrants from deportation.

Teacher group says Florida students take standardized tests up to 45 days a year
","Facing a backlash from teachers and parents over standardized tests, state legislators are discussing whether to pare down the hours students spend on testing. The latest batch of criticism about Florida’s tests coincides with a national discussion about Common Core state standards. One of the potential GOP presidential contenders, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, has long defended the need to use tests to make schools accountable -- a position increasingly at odds with other GOP presidential contenders. The Florida Badass Teachers Association, which is part of a national association that formed in recent years in an effort to fight back against testing, raised concerns about the tests as they planned to protest Bush’s Feb. 10 speech in Tallahassee. Thomas James, an association spokesman and Miami-Dade history teacher, leveled many criticisms of Florida schools, including this one in a statement provided to the Miami Herald before Bush’s speech. ""Florida public school students have become little more than ‘test drones’ being bombarded with an array of standardized high stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year,"" James said. James’ claim about the amount of days eaten up by tests caught our eye because it was more than double the number we heard from state legislative leaders in 2013 -- though Florida has made changes to tests since that time. How many days a year do students actually take standardized tests? Backlash over Florida’s new tests We found no simple answer to that question because it varies widely depending upon students’ grades, courses and district and other factors. Testing of Florida students has always faced some criticism but changes to those tests resulted in a fresh round of backlash within the past year. This year, students will start taking the Florida Standards Assessments aligned to Florida's new education benchmarks, based on the Common Core State Standards. (After the Common Core drew increasingly vocal criticism, the Florida Legislature last year renamed them the Florida Standards with some tweaks.) During his 2014 re-election campaign, Gov. Rick Scott promised to investigate the state testing program and the state expects to have a report ready for the beginning of the legislative session March 3.   James told PolitiFact Florida that he arrived at his claim in part through a bill proposed in February by Senate Education Chairman John Legg, R-Trinity. That bill would require that students spend no more than 5 percent of school hours taking statewide and district-mandated tests. But that adds up to 45 hours -- not days -- of tests. How many hours do students take tests? The Florida Standards Assessments include reading tests in grades 3 through 11, math tests in grades 3 through 8, and science tests in grades 5 and 8. High school students must take six end-of-course exams in subjects including math and history, for example. For example, fourth-graders take 1.5 hours of tests in english language arts, 2.67 hours in writing and 2.67 hours in math. That adds up to just under seven hours of tests. The hours spent on statewide tests grew between the 2013-14 and 2015-16 school year. For example, fourth-graders now spend about one extra hour on such tests while a sixth-grader spends nearly three extra hours on tests. In high school, students take several more hours of tests. For example, a high school student may take 13 hours of statewide tests including language arts, math, biology and history. And then there are the district-wide tests. Some school districts also give their own district-wide exams that are not required by the state, usually to see how students are progressing in any given subject. We interviewed spokespersons in a few school districts to get information about the number of hours their students spend taking standardized tests. Miami-Dade school officials concluded that the maximum example would be for an 11th-grader who takes all required tests and two international baccalaureate (or ""IB"") classes which would add up to about 44 hours. In Pasco County, the typical student on average takes state and districtwide tests for anywhere from three to 26 hours. (This does not include the IB example cited by Miami-Dade.) James told PolitiFact Florida that the Miami-Dade testing calendar shows that testing gears up in March and high schools continue testing nearly through the end of May. But not every student is taking every test throughout that two-month stretch of tests -- and some days they are taking a test for just part of that day. (The Miami Herald wrote in September that only eight out of 180 days on the district’s calendar had no standardized tests, but any individual student would be tested on only a fraction of those days.) Asked about the claim of having testing on as many as 45 days, James said, ""That would be the worst-case scenario."" We should note that even for students who are not taking a test on a particular day or portion of a day, they still could be impacted in some way by the tests. For example, their teachers may be taken out of class to proctor other students taking tests. In May 2014 the Miami Herald reported that some classes at Dr. Michael Krop High School -- James’ school -- were watching movies, such as Frozen, or playing board games during such testing days. But we found no solid evidence to show the extent of students being displaced by other students taking tests. And in any case, this would vary district to district, school to school and grade to grade. How many hours each district spends on testing will become more clear when the Department of Education releases its report during the session. Still, Legg said there isn’t evidence that students are spending 45 days on tests. ""It is very plausible that those students are doing 45 hours,"" Legg said. However, ""I would find it impossible to do 45 complete days."" The Florida Education Association, the union that represents teachers, argues that the number of days devoted to tests is even higher than what James stated and can reach 60 to 80 days. But the FEA counts any day during which a student takes a test for part of the day as a ""testing day,"" and it also includes days when students are in training to use the computers to take the tests. The FEA also points to tests only taken by a fraction of students -- for example, schools whose performance is rated ""D"" or ""F,"" which have to take progress monitoring assessments that higher-rated schools do not. Ruth Haseman Melton, the director of government relations for the Florida School Boards Association, calls James’ statement an oversimplification. An entire day may not be eaten up by tests, but more time is eaten up by tests beyond just the minutes a student takes them. ""It’s not accurate to count the number of days that tests are given, but it’s also not accurate to just count the time it takes to administer the actual test,"" which is what DOE and Senator Legg are suggesting,"" she said. Our ruling Florida students take ""an array of standardized high stakes tests which eat up as much as 45 school days per year,"" said James, a Miami-Dade teacher. Test days do appear to have risen in recent years, and students are not only affected by the tests they take themselves, but also by the impact of other students in their school taking tests. Pinpointing the number of days that students take standardized tests is difficult because it varies widely depending by grade, school, district and other factors. Even so, critics of the amount of testing did not provide hard evidence of any student taken up with testing for 45 total days a year, much less that it is a typical result in Florida. In fact, James’ own district said that the maximum number of hours spent on such tests would equal about 44 hours -- a small fraction of the figure James cited. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/18/florida-badass-teachers-association/teacher-group-says-florida-students-take-standardi/

Are GMOs causing monarch butterflies to become extinct?
","Monarch butterflies are an unexpected victim of the widespread adoption of genetically modified crops, Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., said last week. A genetically modified organism has had its DNA altered in a way that does not occur in nature. One purpose is to increase the plants’ tolerance to pesticides and herbicides. Opponents of GMOs, as they are called, believe they pose health risks, though there’s no generally accepted science that says GMO products are harmful to health. Environmental impacts, however, are the focus of DeFazio’s claim. DeFazio is an advocate for policies that would require food labels to indicate if the product was made with genetically modified crops. In an appearance on MSNBC with celebrity chef Tom Colicchio on Feb. 12, DeFazio said GMO crops are harmful to nature. ""We certainly know there is going to be secondary harm to the environment,"" he said. ""In fact, monarch butterflies are becoming extinct because of this sort of dumping, (the) huge increase in pesticides’ use because of these modified organisms."" We decided to take a closer look at the effect of GMOs on the iconic orange and black butterflies. There’s little doubt that the monarch population is on the decline, but experts say that the adoption of genetically modified crops is not the sole factor. According to the Center for Biological Diversity, the monarch population has dropped 90 percent over the past 20 years. Every winter, monarch butterflies migrate from the Midwestern United States corn-belt region to the Oyamel fir forests in Mexico. This chart from Monarch Watch, a conservation group, shows the steep population change, in terms of the total area occupied by monarchs during their winter stay in Mexico:   The evidence suggests that DeFazio exaggerated when he said monarchs are ""becoming extinct."" The World Wildlife Fund classifies them as ""near threatened,"" which means they are ""likely to become endangered in the near future."" That classification is several steps away from extinct. And conservation experts told us that they are optimistic that the monarch population can be at least partially restored if the right steps are taken. ""Monarchs are not in danger of extinction,"" said Lincoln Brower, a monarch conservation scientist at Sweet Briar College. ""What is endangered is their spectacular migration and overwintering behavior."" Still, even if they are not on the verge of extinction, monarchs are certainly on the decline, at least for now. Why? Several reasons are evident, including deforestation in Mexico, recent weather patterns and reduced availability of milkweed, the butterflies’ main food source. The deforestation stems from illegal logging in Mexico. It has reduced the areas where monarchs can migrate, affecting their lifecycle. However, the Mexican government has largely curtailed the problem in the past five years, Brower said. As far as weather, a serious drought in Texas a couple years ago reduced the amount of flowers along the monarchs’ migration route. This is a problem because, in order to survive the migration, the butterflies need to pick up nectar along the way. And in 2014, an extra-long winter prevented monarchs from migrating successfully back to the United States from Mexico, Brower told the Washington Post. By far the biggest threat, though, is the lowered prevalence of milkweed, due to the increasing use of GMO crops that can withstand a heavy dose of herbicides, Brower said. Milkweed grows in and around crops such as corn and soybeans that are heavily concentrated in the U.S. Midwest. This is the monarch’s spring, summer and fall habitat, and milkweed serves as both the species’ primary food source and where its larvae grow. The problem is that, unlike the GMO crops in close proximity, the milkweed cannot withstand the herbicides. (Milkweed, like other weeds, can stifle crop yield, so farmers don’t like it.) Brower cautioned that there is not yet certain proof that the expansion of GMO crops is causing milkweed declines. But there is an ""extremely tight correlation"" among the increased use of herbicide-tolerant crops, fewer milkweed plants and the declining monarch population, he said. A 2012 study in the journal Insect Conservation and Diversity estimated that between 1990 and 2010, milkweed prevalence declined 58 percent in Midwest agricultural areas. Over the same time frame, the Monarch population declined 81 percent. By 2011, 94 percent of soybean crops were genetically engineered to withstand the widely used herbicide Roundup, and 72 percent of corn crops were herbicide-tolerant. Both genetically modified crops were introduced in the mid 1990s. Additionally, a 2007 congressional ethanol mandate increased the price of corn and soybeans, which encouraged farmers to convert grassland -- where milkweed grows -- into cropland, said Chip Taylor, director of Monarch Watch and a professor of ecology at the University of Kansas. Some argue that conservationists and the media have placed too much blame on GMOs for the loss of monarchs, saying correlation does not necessarily mean causation. Andrew Kniss, a weed expert at the University of Wyoming, wrote in a blog post that the Insect Conservation and Diversity study does not specifically examine if the adoption of GMO crops and herbicides are the reason why milkweed is dying out. There could be another cause, he said. To back up his point, Kniss pointed to a study out of the U.S. Department of Agriculture and Pennsylvania State University that showed only limited effects of herbicide-tolerant plants -- and the use of herbicides -- on native plant diversity outside the border of the agricultural field.   Our ruling DeFazio said that ""monarch butterflies are becoming extinct"" because of increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides. The evidence of a connection is suggestive but not conclusive. Monarch populations have been declining alongside a shrinkage in its primary food source -- milkweed -- and the increased use of crops genetically modified to withstand pesticides and herbicides. However, causation has not been established yet, and other culprits -- deforestation and unexpected weather events -- are likely to have played a role as well. Moreover, DeFazio exaggerated when he said that the butterfly species is ""becoming extinct."" It faces significant challenges, but monarchs remain several steps away from extinction, and many conservationists think the trend can be mitigated. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/17/peter-defazio/are-gmos-causing-monarch-butterflies-become-extinc/

Sonia Sotomayor's family is from Puerto Rico, not 'immigrant family'
","A note to our readers: A reader recently asked us to look into comments made by conservative talk show radio host Laura Ingraham about Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. The reader heard that Ingraham said Sotomayor must choose between her ""immigrant family background"" or the U.S. Constitution she is sworn to protect and uphold. We decided the claim was worth looking into and found the clip, but after publishing our fact-check, we noticed that Ingraham's original claim was made in February 2014, not February 2015. It's not normal procedure to fact-check a claim a year old. Yet in this case, Ingraham's claim has as many flaws now as it did then -- namely because Sotomayor's family is Puerto Rican and not an immigrant family in the traditional sense. We have corrected the fact-check with the accurate dates. *** Puerto Ricans occupy an unusual legal space in America and conservative radio talker Laura Ingraham stumbled in discussing their status. Ingraham was inveighing against Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who told an audience she shunned the term ""illegal aliens"" because it ""does seem insulting."" That got Ingraham fired up. ""Her duty is to defend the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and that’s what she says?"" Ingraham said during a Feb. 4, 2014, broadcast of her radio show. ""Why do we have a Supreme Court Justice whose allegiance obviously goes to her immigrant family background, not the U.S. Constitution?"" A reader asked us to check whether Sotomayor comes from a family of immigrants. We reached out to Ingraham through her producer and did not hear back. Legally speaking, Ingraham’s characterization is inaccurate. Sotomayor’s parents moved to New York City from Puerto Rico during World War II. Puerto Ricans are American citizens, and have been since 1917 when President Woodrow Wilson signed the Jones-Shafroth Act. Puerto Rico became a U.S.-held territory after the 1898 Spanish-American War. The Jones Act granted the island a certain amount of autonomy and carved out a legal patchwork quilt for its residents. Puerto Ricans are U.S. citizens who have no vote in Congress, don’t pay federal income taxes on money earned in Puerto Rico and can’t vote in general elections for president. But they can vote in party primaries. Puerto Rico is neither a state nor a country. But specific to Ingraham’s focus on illegal immigration, the key point is that as citizens Puerto Ricans can move anywhere they wish in the United States. ""Whether people move from California to Texas, or from Puerto Rico to Florida, it’s the same thing,"" said Mark Hugo Lopez, the director of Hispanic research at the Pew Research Center. Lopez said the Pew Center and the U.S. Census use the term migrants when talking about people who move from Puerto Rico. ""The word ‘immigrant’ is inappropriate because they are citizens at birth,"" Lopez said. On the other hand, the distinction between migrant and immigrant can get cloudy. Jose Cruz, a political scientist at the State University of New York at Albany, studied how Puerto Ricans worked their way into New York City politics in the 1960s. In an article, Cruz wrote how Puerto Ricans can appear different when seen through a legal lens or a sociological one. ""De jure, Puerto Ricans born in Puerto Rico are not immigrants but de facto they are,"" Cruz wrote. ""Not only do most of them look foreign but they are clearly foreign by nationality, ethnicity, culture, and language."" Under the second approach, Sotomayor’s parents would carry with them the qualities of many immigrants. Lopez at Pew also said that if he and his colleagues are studying matters of assimilation, they sometimes consider Puerto Ricans under the same umbrella as actual immigrants. The confusion between social and legal perspectives can creep into the popular press. When the New York Times reviewed Sotomayor’s book My Beloved World, it referred to ""the corner of Puerto Rican immigrant New York where she was raised."" However, the instances when Puerto Ricans are thought of as immigrants is only in a sociological, not a legal sense. They are citizens and, whatever limits they face while they live in Puerto Rico, all it takes is a move to any state and they immediately enjoy all the rights of full citizenship, including the right to vote for president and write checks to the IRS. Our ruling Ingraham spoke of Sotomayor’s ""immigrant family background."" Importantly, Ingraham said this in the context of enforcing American immigration laws. Legally, Sotomayor comes from a family that was always American. Her parents did not immigrate to New York. They moved there, just as Americans have moved around the country for centuries. However, we did find that in terms of language and culture, there are times when Puerto Ricans share some characteristics with immigrants, and this can muddy the waters. Researchers sometimes treat Puerto Ricans as immigrants for sociological reasons. Ingraham’s topic was strictly legal, but the element of social identity could have played a role in her meaning. Her statement is largely inaccurate but might contain a smattering of truth. We rate her claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/feb/17/laura-ingraham/ingraham-says-sotomayor-comes-immigrant-family/

Columnist Gail Collins blames Gov. Scott Walker for teacher's lost job
","Gov. Scott Walker brought the story of Megan Sampson, the first-year teacher who in 2010 lost her job in the Milwaukee Public Schools, back into the news. Now it’s Walker critics who are keeping it there. In a Jan. 24, 2015 appearance at an early 2016 presidential event in Iowa, Walker told the audience Sampson -- the ""outstanding teacher of the year in my state"" -- lost her job because of seniority provisions in the school district’s contract with the teachers’ union. (We rated that claim Half True: Sampson was laid off under the provisions of the contract, but her award was for first-year English teachers in the district, not all teachers.) In a Feb. 15, 2015 column titled ""Scott Walker needs an eraser"", Gail Collins of the New York Times cited the story in criticizing Walker’s education policies. One problem: The calendar. In the piece, Collins noted Walker’s mistake in calling Sampson teacher of the year and wrote: ""All of that came as a distinct surprise to Claudia Felske, a member of the faculty at East Troy High School who actually was named a Wisconsin Teacher of the Year in 2010. In a phone interview, Felske said she still remembers when she got the news at a ‘surprise pep assembly at my school.’ As well as the fact that those layoffs happened because Walker cut state aid to education."" The last part caught our attention -- and that of others as well. In short, Walker’s policies had nothing to do with Sampson’s layoff in 2010. At the time, he was in the midst of his successful campaign, but did not take office until January 2011. Rather, MPS laid off a total of 482 teachers in June 2010 in response to a severe budget shortfall, in part tied to declining enrollment. Collins didn’t respond to an email, but the Times posted a correction Feb. 15, 2015. ""An earlier version of this column incorrectly stated that teacher layoffs in Milwaukee in 2010 happened because Gov. Scott Walker ""cut state aid to education."" The layoffs were made by the city’s school system because of a budget shortfall, before Mr. Walker took office in 2011,"" the correction said. Our rating Collins said Gov.

"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Nathan Deal']","
Gov. Deal gets school math right, but comments need more context
","Gov. Nathan Deal’s signature education legislation this year calls for a constitutional amendment to create a special school district solely for perennially failing schools. Deal’s office says 141 schools -- more than 60 in metro Atlanta --  currently could land in the proposed district and under state control, having each scored 60 or below for three straight years on Georgia’s annual report card, the College and Career Performance Index (CCRPI). The state would have unprecedented powers in the ""opportunity school district."" It could run schools, close them, partner with local school districts to operate them or turn them into charter schools. The superintendent of the district would report directly to the governor. Deal acknowledges that it’s a dramatic step and in an interview on Feb. 12 dashed off some statistics to counter those who would say more money is the answer. ""I would say to them that 96 percent of those (failing schools) pay more than the average of the state of $8,400 per child per year, and about 26 percent of them spend considerably more than the state average,"" the governor said. ""If they say that money alone will fix this, then the statistics and the information that we have does not bear that out."" We wondered if the vast majority of these failing schools are, as the governor said, spending more money per student than the average school. We decided to check the governor’s math. First, a little background. Deal’s proposal would require approval from two-thirds of the General Assembly and would be put before voters in 2016. It would broaden the governor’s powers over K-12 education. Those powers already include the ability to remove dysfunctional local school boards. Some lawmakers and local school superintendents are against creation of a special school district for failing schools. Critics say that approach creates  a one-size-fits-all solution for some very complex problems and fails to recognize how those challenges have been compounded by years of underfunding from the state. At least one metro school superintendent has suggested that districts with large percentages of low-income students be given more money when the state’s education funding formula is revamped at Deal’s direction in the next year. Luvenia Jackson, superintendent of Clayton County Schools, said she ""applauds the governor for wanting to do more. ""But I don’t know if this is the answer,"" Jackson said. Clayton has three of the failing schools and is a federal Title I school system due to of its overall high poverty rate. ""How about restoring some of those (budget) cuts and see what happens,"" said Jackson, who estimates the district has been underfunded $100 million by the state in the past five years. ""Most of our children come in with a level of readiness below what is required. They need more health care, more counselors, things that must be taken into consideration. We have to nourish the whole child."" Robert Avossa, superintendent of Fulton County Schools, said the governor ""is correct to stand up for these communities and shine a bright light"" on the problem of failing schools. Fulton, one of the state’s wealthiest counties, has already started working to bring additional support and resources to its seven failing schools, all located in areas with a multitude of problems, including high mobility, poverty, unemployment and crime, Avossa said. Through a public-private partnership, the school system raised enough money to offer $20,000 bonuses to recruit 15 experienced and talented teachers to three of the schools this year, he said. ""This is a people problem more than it’s a money problem,"" Avossa said. ""We need flexibility on how we spend our salary dollars to keep the best in the lowest performing schools."" Almost all of the state’s failing schools qualify for Title I federal money because of their high percentages of students from low-income families. Millions more from the state’s Race to the Top grant have targeted failing schools in the past five years. These schools are a tiny share of Georgia’s 2,267 public schools: 1,321 elementary schools, 480 middle schools and 453 high schools according to the state Department of Education. Now to the math Jen Talaber, a Deal spokeswoman, said the governor based his statement on a comparison of a list of the failing schools and a report from the state Department of Education on per pupil spending by district. Information on per pupil spending at the school level is not collected by the state, she said. ""Our operating assumption, because of those data limitations, was that the district per pupil expenditure would apply to the school,"" Talaber said. ""That may not be the case in every district, and we have consistently provided that clarification in all of our conversations."" Ben Scafidi, a nationally recognized expert on the economics of education and a professor of economics at Kennesaw State University, and PolitiFact both independently confirmed that Deal is correct: 96 percent of the schools with three consecutive years of sub-60 CCRPI scores spend above the state average per student expenditure, identified in the DOE report as $8,400. PolitiFact’s analysis also showed 37 schools with a per pupil expenditure above $10,000, which could fit the governor’s definition of schools spending well above the state average. Scafidi pointed out: :""We cannot say whether schools with more low income or minority students spend more or less than other schools within their districts."" The reasons, he said, are three-fold: veteran teachers who are higher paid are usually in schools with more white students and fewer lower income students; federal compensatory programs target funds to individual schools with larger portions of low income students; and federal and state programs target funds to special needs students. Our conclusion; Gov. Nathan Deal is pushing a constitutional amendment to create an ""opportunity school district"" that would give his office and the state broad powers over failing schools. Last week, the governor cited statistics indicating that 96 percent of the failing schools spend more per student than the state average and 26 percent spend well above the state’s average per student expenditure of $8,400. His statement is accurate and relies on student spending per district in the absence of actual school-level data. His statement doesn’t point out that the failing schools are likely spending more money because they are receiving more money as a result of having high concentrations of students from low-income families. It could be argued that the money they receive and spend isn’t working -- afterall, they are failing schools by the state’s current measure of success, the CCRPI index.  Or it could be said that they need more money or a different kind of help, or both.

Gov. Scott Walker says Wisconsin's 'teacher of the year' was laid off due to union contract
","For years, Gov. Scott Walker has made high school English teacher Megan Sampson the face of Act 10 -- his signature bill that curtailed collective bargaining for most public employee unions. Sampson was a first-year teacher who lost her job in 2010 after Milwaukee Public Schools experienced a budget crisis. Walker cites her as an example of why his Act 10 reforms -- and the changes they made to how public employees can be hired and fired -- were needed. In essence, he says, an excellent teacher lost her job because of the union contract. Walker first brought national attention to Sampson when he mentioned her in the opening paragraph of a March 10, 2011 Wall Street Journal opinion piece. Now, Walker has been including a version of Sampson’s story in the speeches he is making as he moves toward a 2016 presidential bid. Here’s how Walker explained it Jan. 24, 2015 at the Iowa Freedom Summit. ""In 2010, there was a young woman named Megan Sampson who was honored as the outstanding teacher of the year in my state,"" he said. ""And not long after she got that distinction, she was laid off by her school district."" Walker explained: ""Her union contract said the last hired was the first fired; the last in was the first out."" Is Walker right? Digging into the claim As evidence, Walker spokesman Tom Evenson cited a June 14, 2010 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article  that focused on Sampson and other MPS teachers who were laid off. Sampson, a graduate of the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, had taken her first job with MPS in the fall of 2009. She taught English at Bradley Tech High School. That year, the article noted, Sampson received the Nancy Hoefs Memorial Award for the Outstanding First-Year Teacher from the Wisconsin Council of Teachers of English. One week after receiving the award, MPS issued layoff notices to 482 teachers, according to seniority. Sampson was among those who got the notice under the seniority rules that were part of the contract with MPS and the teachers’ union. Such rules are common in labor agreements. In August 2010, the district attempted to rehire -- ""call back"" in union parlance -- Sampson, after numerous resignations and additional funding became available. However, by then she had accepted a position teaching English at Wauwatosa East High School, where she is still employed. So, on the layoff portion of claim, Walker is correct. Megan Sampson lost her job at Bradley Tech because of the union contract in place at the time. And Walker is also correct that Act 10 did away with such rules. The law limits the ability of public unions to bargain collectively for anything except raises, and those have an inflation-based cap. The changes ended bargaining over benefits, overtime, work conditions -- including the use of seniority when it comes to layoffs. Other twists But Walker stretches things when he emphasizes Sampson’s honor, making the award more significant. As the original Journal Sentinel story noted, Sampson was named outstanding first-year teacher by the Wisconsin Council of Teachers of English. (Indeed, this is the story cited by Walker’s team as evidence of his claim.) Nine months later, in the Wall Street Journal piece, Walker called her ""an Outstanding First Year Teacher in Wisconsin."" That’s mostly correct. In Iowa, Walker described her as  ""the outstanding teacher of the year."" That overstates the honor. Others have made the same observation. There are 50,000-plus public school teachers in the state. Only a percentage of those are English teachers. And first-year English teachers are a smaller group still. The state does name an outstanding teacher of the year -- there actually were four of them in 2010. The state Department of Public Instruction gave the high school teacher award to Claudia Klein Felske, an English teacher in the East Troy district. The award was presented Sept. 8, 2010 by state Schools Superintendent Tony Evers at an assembly in the high school gym. After Walker’s recent speeches, Felske posted an ""open letter"" to the governor criticizing his education policies. Our rating In Iowa, Walker said the woman named Wisconsin’s ""outstanding teacher of the year"" was laid off by the Milwaukee Public Schools in 2010 under ""seniority and tenure rules"" that were eliminated by his Act 10 changes. His point on the seniority rules and their elimination under Act 10 are on target -- though he does not mention that MPS had offered Sampson the job back. However, in seeking a stronger rhetorical point, Walker stretches the honor Sampson received. It helps make the story more dramatic, but less accurate.

Mayor Dave Claunch says Austin has more Capitol lobbyists than any other Texas city
","Texas cities naturally gear up to fight state encroachment by enlisting lobbyists, an Austin-area leader said. At a January West Lake Hills City Council meeting, where the council voted to hire a lobbying firm for $40,500 over nine months, Mayor Dave Claunch said employing lobbyists is a way for cities to preserve local control. Claunch went on to say: ""Austin has more lobbyists working for it than any other municipality in Texas, mostly because they are frequently a target of the Legislature."" Is Austin No. 1 among Texas cities in its load of lobbyists patrolling the Capitol? Claunch, asked how he reached his conclusion, said by phone that's just ""common general knowledge."" Checking lobbyist registrations For our own look, we turned to state filings by lobbyists. The Texas Ethics Commission has the responsibility of maintaining records including lobbying activity reports. Under state law, lobbyists are required to register with the commission and list their clients annually; the filings are available online. By phone, Natalia Ashley of the Texas Ethics Commission staff said whenever a lobbyist gets a client, he or she must amend their registration. When this happens, the agency’s public lobbyist-client lists are updated, she said. And when there is an update, she said, the new breakdown replaces the previous version posted online, ""so we don’t keep a printed document for each update."" Still with us? This was significant for our purposes, we realized, because a lobbyist-client list for 2015 about the moment Claunch spoke wasn’t readily available to us a few days later. By the time we inquired, that particular list had been overtaken online by updated versions possibly presenting information that would not have existed when Claunch spoke. To fairly check his claim, then, we considered a next-best thing, the agency’s lobbyist-client list for cities covering 2014. And according to that 2014 Lobby List, updated by the state Jan. 9, 2015, the City of Austin had 22 state-registered lobbyists in 2014, a total greater than the count shown for any of 89 other municipalities. The City of Irving, between Dallas and Fort Worth, came in second with 13. West Lake Hills had four people registered. Top 5 Texas Cities Based on Number of Registered Outside Lobbyists (2014) CITY STATE-REGISTERED LOBBYISTS Austin 22 Irving 13 Fort Worth 10 Houston 9 San Antonio 9 Source: Texas Ethics Commission, 2014 Lobby List with Concerns (Employers and Clients), Jan. 9, 2015 (downloaded Feb. 4, 2015) A complication? We wondered if those reported counts made this a slam-dunk claim. Possibly not, a City of Austin official suggested. John Hrncir, a city governmental relations officer, told us that even though 22 people were listed as lobbying for the city in 2014, he directly consulted with less than half that many. Similarly, a City of San Antonio official said by phone the number of lobbyists shown in state filings as representing that city do not reflect the lobbyists he regularly consults. Jeff Coyle, San Antonio’s director of intergovernmental relations, said he communicates actively with about four or five of San Antonio’s nine contracted lobbyists. Brie Franco, legislative attorney for the City of El Paso, said by phone that she talks directly to three of the four lobbyists listed as representing the city in state records. El Paso hired the firm Focused Advocacy to represent its interests in the legislative session, the same firm enlisted by West Lake Hills. Hrncir said that when a lobbying firm tells the ethics commission its clients and expected payments, the firm may specify all employees with any possibility of doing work on behalf of the city. We ran Hrncir’s analysis by Jack Gullahorn, president of the Professional Advocacy Association of Texas, which says it’s the only recognized statewide association for the lobby and government affairs community. By phone, Gullahorn said Hrncir was correct and added that the entirety of lobbyists in a firm routinely register for all of the clients listed underneath the firm even though someone at the practice may be the primary contact. Lobbyists do this ""to be conservative in following the law,"" Gullahorn said, by ensuring they don’t get in trouble with the state if someone is found lobbying for the city without reporting that in advance. According to an ethics commission report on laws affecting lobbyists, each lobbyist must provide information about each client  that employs, retains or reimburses them to lobby. Spending on lobbyists It’s one thing for Austin to have the most lobbyists indicating they’re out there walking the pink building on its behalf. We also looked into how the city stacks up in spending on contract lobbyists at the Capitol. According to a resolution approved without debate at the Austin City Council’s Nov. 20, 2014, meeting, council members agreed to contract with 10 lobbying firms for the 2015 legislative session for an amount not to exceed $805,000 all together. But there were a couple changes after that, Hrncir said, because lobbyists Randy Erben and Luis Saenz joined the administration of Gov. Greg Abbott. Hrncir said the city made an individual contract with Brian Yarbrough, Erben’s previous partner. Jennifer Rodriguez from McGuireWoods Consulting was to assume Saenz’s role on the city’s part, Hrncir said. Lobby Firms Hired by City of Austin Before 2015 Legislative Session FIRM MAXIMUM AMOUNT THE FIRM OR LOBBYIST EXPECTS FROM THE CITY FOR LOBBYING Nora Del Bosque $65,000 Randall Erben*/Erben & Yarbrough $90,000 Marta Greytok Consulting $90,000 Cliff Johnson $90,000 Demetrius McDaniel/GreenbergTaurig $90,000 Clayton Pope $90,000 Luis Saenz*/McGuireWoods Consulting $70,000 Trent Townsend/Imperium Public Affairs $65,000 Joe D.

To approximate the amount city-hired lobbyists expected to be paid during 2014, we noted the minimum values and maximum values of prospective compensation reported by all the lobbyists listed for each of the five cities already having the most outside lobbyists for the year. In this subset, Austin was No. 1 again (as noted) but Irving, which had more lobbyists than Houston and Fort Worth, was evidently outspent by bigger cities.

In 2014, indeed, Austin had more lobbyists (22) representing its interests before state government than any other Texas city and also was expected to spend more on such lobbyists than a few other cities identified as clients by multiple lobbyists. But lobbyist filings with the state don’t reveal how much time any lobbyist puts in for a particular client. It's possible, for instance, that some lobbyists who registered for Austin worked for firms hired by the city but didn’t personally put in time on its behalf.

Conservation group: Oil firms can lease federal land for less than the price of a Big Mac
","Doubts that Washington is getting as much money as it should when it leases land to oil and gas companies go back 40 years. The decades have done little to ease those concerns. In 2013, the Government Accountability Office reported that in the year before, oil and gas companies took in revenues of $66 billion and paid $10 billion to the government. Onshore leases in particular have not kept pace with the times, according to the GAO. The conservation group Center for Western Priorities took up this banner with an intriguing comparison on its website. ""Oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac,"" the center wrote. The going price for a Big Mac, without the fries and the drink, is $3.99. We decided to check whether you can lease an acre of federal land for less than that. Greg Zimmerman, the policy director at the Center for Western Priorities, sent us a link to a September 2014 sales report from the Nevada office of the Bureau of Land Management. The numbers back up Zimmerman’s claim. Texas-based Appaloosa Energy paid $6,426 for the rights to drill on 3,212 acres. Buena Vista Holdings out of Colorado paid $11,392 for the rights to 5,693 acres. That comes out to $2 per acre, and even the mathematically challenged can see that is about half the price of a Big Mac. Under BLM regulations, $2 per acre is the minimum possible bid. Just to be clear, the company pays this money each year for the right to pump oil or gas from the land over a 10-year period. It doesn’t actually own the land, but it has locked down the oil and gas rights. Zimmerman acknowledges that there is another wrinkle here. There’s an additional $1.50 per acre fee for the first five years. Zimmerman described it as the cost to hold the land while the company assesses what to do with it. A BLM spokesman told PunditFact that the bidder would pay $1.50 per year for the first five years and then $2.00 a year for the next five. ""Nevertheless, even if you add the $1.50 per acre rent to the $2.00 per acre bid, it would still be less than a Big Mac,"" Zimmerman said. If the land ever starts producing oil or gas, the company starts paying royalties to the government on top of the $2 per acre leasing fee. It’s important to note that the statement simply said oil companies can obtain an acre for very little money. It doesn’t say this happens a lot. When we ran the numbers for all of 2014, we found that the average price per acre nationwide was $220. That was for parcels leased through a competitive auction. If a parcel finds no takers through competitive bidding, the government can offer it non-competitively. One time, that led to a winning bid of about $1.50 per acre. From what we could find, the lowest lease prices were all in Nevada. Brad Posey is a managing director for Appaloosa Energy, a company that successfully secured the right to a few thousand acres at a cost of $2 each. Posey said the property comes with many hurdles before any wells can be drilled. ""That land has so many restrictions on it,"" Posey said. ""There are the prairie chickens, and habitat. A very limited portion can be explored on."" Posey is correct about the land. A proposed resource management plan for the entire area puts a number of conditions on development. It protects municipal water supplies, grazing areas and trails for off-road trail riding. And animals. ""These areas contain some of the most important habitat remaining for sage-grouse and other at-risk wildlife,"" the plan said. Posey called the venture ""pure wildcat speculation."" This raises the question, if it’s such a long shot, why is the land worth even $2 an acre? Because, as another Appaloosa managing director Martin Shields explained, sometimes an unpromising bit of land surprises you. ""Many years ago, I was with a company that paid the $2 minimum and it paid off,"" Shields said. We asked Zimmerman if he knew of any land that went for $2 an acre that ever produced oil or gas. Zimmerman said he did not know of any case when it did. Our ruling The Center for Western Priorities said that oil companies can obtain an acre of public land for less than the price of a Big Mac. A Big Mac goes for $3.99. Thousands of acres of land in Nevada were leased for $2 per acre in 2014. We found one case where federal land went for about $1.50 an acre. The track record on land leased at those low rates ever producing oil or gas is quite poor and the average leasing price nationwide is $220 per acre. The claim is accurate but it downplays that companies pay a hundred times as much for land that is more likely to be productive. We rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/16/center-western-priorities/conservation-group-oil-firms-can-lease-federal-lan/

Haas says fewer women killed by guns in states with expanded background checks
","Closing a loophole in state law that allows some Virginians to buy firearms without going through a background check is a matter of life and death to women, according to Lori Haas, state director of the Coalition to Stop Gun Violence. Haas was among a number of gun control advocates who spoke at a news conference last month in favor of a series of bills aimed at tightening state firearm laws. Haas has compelling experience with gun violence: Her daughter, Emily, was grazed twice in the head during the 2007 shootings at Virginia Tech that left 32 dead and 17 wounded. Her brief remarks touched on background check laws. All states require licensed gun dealers to conduct a background check before selling a firearm to make sure the prospective buyer does not have a criminal record or disqualifying mental condition. But Virginia and 32 other states don’t require background checks for firearms bought through an unlicensed seller -- someone who isn’t in the routine business of selling guns. Haas backed a bill that would have  narrowed that exception. In states that run background checks for privately-sold handguns, ""49 percent fewer women are shot and killed,"" she said. Since Haas spoke, the General Assembly has scuttled major gun control bills, including the loophole closer. But background checks for all gun buyers is a perennial issue before the legislature and we wondered whether Haas’ statement was correct in terms of the number she used and the cause and effect of background check laws on women’s lives. She told us the figure came from Everytown for Gun Safety, an advocacy group founded by former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. The numbers The group issued a report last September examining firearm homicides of women by intimate partners -- current and former husbands, as well as boyfriends. It found that from 2008-2012, the rate of such murders was 46 percent lower in 14 states that had background checks for some or all private handgun sales when compared with the rest of the nation. Stacey Radnor, a spokeswoman with Everytown, said the group also found that the level of non-gun intimate partner homicides of women was much less stark -- only 4.3 percent lower in the states with private-sale background checks for handguns. We should note, however, that Haas’ statement focused on a broader definition of victims.  She cited ""women"" without any reference to whether they were domestic violence victims. So to examine her exact statement, we needed to find figures on gun murders deaths of all women, which are not in Everytown’s report. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention compiles fatality data based on information from death certificates filed in each state. We looked at the 14 states that had background checks on private handgun sales during the 5-year period Everytown references. Those states are California, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Iowa, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island and Pennsylvania. Three other states have in recent years added private-sale background checks: Colorado, Delaware and Washington. We found those firearms homicide figures of women for all but three states with small populations -- Rhode Island (which requires a background check for private handgun sales) as well as Vermont and Wyoming (which do not). The CDC withholds the number of firearms homicides of women in those states because they are so few in number. But given the small size of each state’s population, it wouldn’t affect the overall trend line for the 47 other states where the information was available. We found that in states with private-sale background checks, the rate of firearm homicides of females age 18 and over was 1.0 per 100,000 women. In the states that didn’t extend background checks to private handgun sales, the homicide rate was 1.6 per 100,000 women in that age group. That means there were 38 percent fewer firearms homicides of women in the states with private-sale background checks for handguns than the rest of the nation, lower than Haas’ statistic but still a significant figure. In Virginia, the rate was 1.4 per 100,000 women. We should note some states without background checks on all handgun sales bucked the trend of lower firearms violence against females. Minnesota, which has no requirement for background checks on private handgun sales, had a rate of 0.6 firearms homicides for every 100,000 women. That was one-third the rate of North Carolina, which requires a background check of anyone seeking to buy a handgun. Cause and effect Two analysts we contacted urged caution in interpreting a correlation in lower rates of gun violence to private-sale background checks. ""Making causal claims is always riskier,"" Jacquelyn White, a psychology professor at the University of North Carolina Greensboro, said in an email. ""States that require background checks may also be more likely to support other efforts that contribute to the well-being of their residents. Remember, correlation is not causation. There may be other factors, such as a more enlightened commitment to creating healthy and safe communities, that result in an array of programs and policies that reduce domestic violence."" Gary Kleck, a criminology professor at Florida State University, said Everytown’s figure ""takes no other account of any other factors that affect homicides."" ""States do not randomly pass gun laws -- those that pass gun laws are different in many ways from those that do not,"" Kleck, who has studied the impact of background checks on homicide rates, said in an email.  ""For obvious political reasons, it’s easier to enact stricter gun laws in states with fewer gun-owning voters. Thus, states that extended background checks to private gun transfers had lower gun ownership rates even before those laws were passed. Likewise, states with stricter gun laws are more urban, less likely to be Southern or Western (and thus culturally different), more politically liberal etc. You can’t isolate the effect of a gun law without controlling for other violence-related factors."" Our ruling Haas said in states with comprehensive background checks for handguns, ""49 percent fewer women are shot and killed."" She supports that statement by pointing to figures examining a narrower group of female firearms victims -- those killed in domestic violence situations. But figures examining the broader group of victims she cited in her statement -- women in general -- show 38 percent fewer women were shot and killed in the states with private-sale background checks on handgun sales. That’s not quite high as the figure she cited, but it still represents a lower rate of gun homicides of women in states with comprehensive background checks. But experts cautioned against reading too much into that correlation. They noted that there may be other factors beyond background checks that led to that result.

Barack Obama says nearly 20 percent of women in the U.S. have been raped or faced rape attempt
","On the occasion of this year’s Grammy Awards, President Barack Obama released a public-service announcement targeting sexual violence, particularly against women and girls. In his videotaped statement, Obama mentioned a statistic about the prevalence of rape -- with a frequency that was startling enough to provoke several PolitiFact readers to ask us to check it out. ""Right now,"" Obama said, ""nearly one in five women in America has been a victim of rape or attempted rape."" Is that statistic correct? We took a closer look. We’ll start by noting that this is a different statistic than one that drew some criticism when the Obama White House and other political figures raised it last year. Vice President Joe Biden, for instance, said, ""One in five of every one of those young women who is dropped off for that first day of (college), before they finish school, will be assaulted in her college years."" Biden and others were referring to college campuses -- unlike Obama’s most recent comment, which was referencing overall patterns in the population. We’ll discuss the evidence for both ""one in five"" statistics in a moment, but first, let’s look at where Obama’s recent claim came from. The CDC study The number comes from the 2011 National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey, which was released in September 2014 by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The survey was based on landline and cellphone interviews with more than 12,000 people who were 18 years or older, in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. The survey’s summary table shows that 19.3 percent of women interviewed reported experiences that the authors categorized as rape or attempted rape. That’s ""nearly one in five,"" so on the broad figure Obama cited, he correctly reported the CDC’s finding. What qualified as rape in the survey? This is where it gets a bit complicated. The three subcategories listed are: • ""Completed forced penetration,"" 11.5 percent. • ""Attempted forced penetration,"" 6.4 percent. • ""Completed alcohol- or drug-facilitated penetration"" without the ability to consent, 9.3 percent. However, you can’t just add up all three subcategories -- you’d get 27.2 percent, which is significantly higher than the survey’s overall rate for rape of 19.3 percent. CDC explained that the subcategories are derived from the overall rape estimate, and they overlap. Within each estimate, victims are counted only once, but due to the possibility of re-victimization, the same respondent may be represented in multiple categories, CDC spokeswoman Courtney Lenard said. Comparing the CDC study with the campus study As we noted, the campus study had some methodological problems. The biggest was that researchers surveyed undergraduates at two unnamed large public universities (one in the Midwest and one in the South) -- a sampling that may not be valid for the entire country. Large universities may not be representative of experiences at mid-size or small colleges. Further, the two colleges selected may not even be representative of large campuses. In addition, the results for the campus survey were gleaned from 5,446 Web-based responses. Web-based polls yield a lower response rate than other methods, and researchers say that could skew results. By contrast, the CDC study was based on the tried-and-true technique of telephone polling -- and used a far larger, and more random, sample. It’s also worth noting that the studies had slightly different scopes. The campus survey was about ""sexual assault,"" which included not only rape but also ""forced touching of a sexual nature (forced kissing, touching of private parts, grabbing, fondling, rubbing up against you in a sexual way, even if it is over your clothes)."" By contrast, the CDC figures cited by Obama focused exclusively on cases of penetration or attempted penetration. For these reasons, we consider talking points based on the CDC study to be significantly more credible than those based on the campus study. Experts agree. Last year, when we interviewed Mary Koss, a public health professor at the University of Arizona, she told us that the Campus Sexual Assault Study ""is not the soundest data (the White House) could use."" For this fact-check, however, she said the CDC provides the best available data. Obama, she said, is ""basically right. No survey is perfect, but this survey is considered very sound in the field."" We do see one legitimate reason for caution. The CDC study takes a public-health approach in its methodology, asking respondents about their past experiences without looking at whether the activities may have qualified as crimes per se, as our friends at the Washington Post Fact Checker have noted. Surveys that take a criminal-justice approach, by contrast, focus on activities that were presumed to have been criminal. Because of this methodological difference, criminal-justice surveys tend to report significantly lower rates of rape than public-health surveys do. For instance, the CDC study came up with 1.9 million cases of rape in 2012, whereas the National Crime Victimization Survey found far fewer rapes -- 347,000 -- over the same period. So, given two survey methods to choose from, Obama picked the one that produced the higher number. Ordinarily, we take issue with claims that cherry-pick results. In this case, however, we aren’t as critical of his decision, since independent scientific experts have long questioned whether criminal justice surveys under-report instances of rape. Notably, in 2014, the National Research Council concluded that under-reporting of rape in the National Crime Victimization Survey was ""highly likely."" William D. Kalsbeek, an emeritus professor of biostatistics at the University of North Carolina and co-chair of the National Research Council panel, told PolitiFact that ""the search continues for the best way to measure rape and sexual assault in population surveys. Our panel found that the broader, behavior-based definition of rape and sexual assault used by (the CDC study) is preferable to the more limiting, legal-based definition"" used in the criminal-justice survey. Our ruling Obama said that ""nearly one in five women in America has been a victim of rape or attempted rape."" A well-respected survey by the CDC found that 19.3 percent of women reported experiences that are considered to be rape or attempted rape under the survey’s guidelines. There are other surveys, using a different methodology, that show lower rates of rape, but researchers say the data in the CDC study is at least as credible, if not more so. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/16/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-nearly-1-5-women-us-has-been-rap/

R.I. Sen. Leonidas Raptakis says state minimum wage rose 31 percent in two years
","The Rhode Island minimum wage rose on Jan. 1 this year, following increases on Jan. 1 in 2013 and 2014. It's now at $9 an hour unless you're in a special category such as waiter or waitress, in which case the hourly minimum is $2.89. A proposal to raise the minimum to $10.10 per hour (but not for waiters and waitresses) was the subject of a Feb. 5 hearing before the House Committee on Labor. We heard two opponents complain that the minimum wage had already risen by 16 percent in the last two years. Then we heard testimony from Sen. Leonidas P. Raptakis, D-Coventry, who wants future increases tied to inflation, not hiked randomly. ""We're talking about small business here in Rhode Island,"" said Raptakis, referring to ""increases that are unacceptable. Two dollars and thirty five cents the minimum wage has risen in the last two years. That's 31 percent. Never in Rhode Island history has the minimum wage gone up in two years (by) $2.35 or 31 percent."" Sixteen percent? Thirty one percent? The discrepancy sent us scrambling for some data and our calculator. Two years ago, the minimum wage was $7.75. It's $9 an hour now. That's an increase of $1.25 or 16.1 percent. It seemed that Raptakis had doubled the actual increase. So we called him. He said he was referring to what the increase would be if the new legislation and its $10.10 minimum wage were approved. That's a jump of $2.35, but over three years, not two. That increase would be 30.3 percent, which is close to 31 percent. Raptakis also said Rhode Island's minimum wage has never risen by $2.35 or 31 percent in two years. (We'll assume he meant three years because raising the number of years is the only way his statement is accurate.) He's correct on the amount, but not on the percentage. The biggest three-year dollar increase we found was $1.60 due to hikes implemented in 2013, 2014 and 2015. If you look at percentage, the years 1979, 1980 and 1981 become important. That's when three increases totaling 80 cents were implemented. That was added to a starting base of $2.30 per hour. That's a three-year hike of 34.8 percent. Thus, the 31 percent increase over three years that Raptakis was talking about would not be unprecedented. However, unlike today, those were years when the U.S. was dealing with double-digit inflation rates. In summary, Sen. Raptakis testified that Rhode Island's minimum wage has risen $2.35 or 31 percent in the past two years. The actual increase Rhode Island businesses have been wrestling with over the past two years is significantly less, and he subsequently told us he was referring to what would happen if the $10.10 minimum wage was approved. The correct answer is 16.1 percent. We rate his statement False.

Educator says 60,000 New York parents refused to let their children take Common Core tests in 2014
","Around the country, there’s a growing debate over Common Core, a set of national education standards adopted by more than 40 states, including Rhode Island. Among the complaints critics raise is that Common Core places too much emphasis on standardized testing. In many states, there are grassroots movements encouraging parents to refuse to allow their children to take the tests. Retired teacher Sheila Resseger raised that issue in a Jan. 10, 2015 Providence Journal commentary critical of standardized testing. In her piece, ""Students can opt out of new tests in R.I,"" Resseger said that ""by spring 2014, parents of 60,000 students in New York state had refused to let them take the Common Core tests."" Resseger also said there would be no penalty for Rhode Island students who opt out of taking the state’s first set of Common Core-related tests, the Partnership for Assessment of Readiness for College and Careers (PARCC), which are to be given this spring.   Because the debate over Common Core has been so intense, in Rhode Island and elsewhere, we were curious if Resseger was right about the number of testing opt-outs in New York. The 60,000 number has been widely reported in newspaper and TV stories, almost always without attribution. It turned out to be a surprisingly difficult number to pin down. We started with  Resseger, who referred us to a flier that included the 60,000 figure put out by NYS Allies for Public Education, a New York state group that opposes Common Core testing. Sure enough the flier read ""In 2014, Parents of 60,000 Students Refused NYS Common Core Tests."" She also referred us to Loy Gross, of Pavilion, N.Y., one of the parents involved in the anti-Common Core group. Gross, the mother of two daughters, participated in an effort last year to count the number of students boycotting the tests statewide. Gross, who now homeschools her children, told us that volunteers obtained figures from about half the state’s 698 districts on the number of students opting out of each of the two tests -- one in math and the other in English. We asked for the spreadsheet she used and samples of numbers from collectors. Gross never got back to us despite repeated phone calls and emails. We also contacted the New York State  Education Department. A spreadsheet on the department’s website showed that 1.136 million New York State students in grades three through eight  took the English language arts assessments and 1.08 million students took the math assessments in 2014. Jeanne Beattie, a spokeswoman for the department, said approximately 49,000 students didn’t take the English test for a ""known valid reason,"" such as a medically excused absence for illness or injury. About 67,000 students didn’t test in math for the same reasons, she said. But those aren’t students who refused the tests. Beattie said the department doesn’t ""directly collect test refusals."" We also contacted the U.S. Department of Education, which also said it didn’t collect such data. We also reached out to the New York State Council of School Superintendents. Robert N. Lowry Jr., council deputy director, said his organization didn’t have refusal numbers either, but he forwarded a copy of an October 2014 study undertaken by the council that indicated that a sizable number of students were opting out of the tests. According to the report, Finding a Way Forward: Superintendent Views on the Impact of New York State Education Reform: More than 35 percent of superintendents estimated test refusals at 5 percent or more in their district. Eight percent of superintendents estimated that more than 20 percent of their students refused to participate in the English language arts or the mathematics assessments. More than half the superintendents reported an increase in test refusals since 2013, particularly on Long Island and in Central New York. Refusals were more prevalent in suburbs and the highest income districts, where achievement is not a problem. Conversely, 21 percent of superintendents reported having fewer than 1 percent of students refuse to take the ELA tests and 19 percent for mathematics. Ultimately, we got some help from Geoff Decker, a senior reporter at Chalkbeat, a nonprofit news organization covering educational change in New York and a handful of other states. Decker has covered the controversy over Common Core testing in New York. Decker forwarded to us the spreadsheet compiled by the NY State Allies for Public Education, showing its counting of test opt-outs, some by district, some by individual schools. The spreadsheet showed that 38,149 students refused to take the English test last April and 44,576 boycotted the math test a few weeks later. Since the group gathered numbers from only about half the state’s districts, the total number of opt-outs is likely much higher. Included in those numbers are figures from Long Island, a hotbed of opposition to Common Core. Jeanette Deutermann, a Bellmore, N.Y., mother who led the opt out in Long Island, provided us with her own spreadsheet  that showed that 20,545 Long Island students opted out of the English test last spring, while 22,068 boycotted the math test. In some districts, more than 1,000 students opted out of tests. In at least one, more than 2,000 opted out of the math test. Deutermann told us that the numbers came from teachers, administrators and, sometimes, parents. All were confirmed by administrators, she said. ""Our reports were by no means scientific, but I believe close,"" Deutermann said in an email. ""If anything, our spreadsheets were low, as some districts refused to release their numbers."" Our ruling Retired teacher Sheila Resseger wrote that ""By spring 2014, parents of 60,000 students in New York state had refused to let them take the Common Core tests."" While there’s no official tally of students opting out, the unofficial but detailed tallies by Common Core opponents show more than 38,000 students boycotted the English test and more than 44,000 students boycotted the math test. And those are numbers from just half the state’s districts. Those numbers and the other evidence we found suggest that the 60,000 is not only accurate, but perhaps understated. But there’s no precise count. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/feb/15/sheila-resseger/educator-says-60000-new-york-parents-refused-let-t/

Bernie Sanders has taken corporate lobbyist money — in small amounts
","Bernie Sanders is fond of calling his presidential campaign a grass-roots movement that rejects money from big-business interests. But one of the Vermont senator’s top supporters, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., went a step further than the candidate himself in describing his disdain for corporate cash. ""One major reason I support Bernie is his consistency when things are hard. Not only does Bernie reject corporate money in 2020, he’s also never taken corporate lobbyist money in his *entire political career*,"" Ocasio-Cortez tweeted, using asterisks for emphasis. ""He is a real one. And in politics, that is nearly impossible to find."" Sanders never once took corporate lobbyist money? That’s not the case.  During the 2016 presidential campaign, when Sanders finished as runner-up to Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, it was reported that Sanders had received money from nearly two dozen registered federal lobbyists, including one from the National Mining Association.  And figures compiled by the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan nonprofit that tracks federal campaign contributions, show Sanders has received $3.35 million from ""lawyers and lobbyists"" since 1989. ""Corporate lobbyist"" isn’t a precise term. But we can check Ocasio-Cortez’s claim based on whether Sanders has ever taken contributions from lobbyists who represent corporations, even if they amount to only a tiny percentage of all his campaign money.  In fact, there have been a number of such instances, dating back more than a decade. In his current campaign, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, Sanders has received contributions from at least two federally registered lobbyists. They include $100 from EY lobbyist Dave Koshgarian, whose clients include Boeing Co., MetLife Inc. and New York Life Insurance; and $27 from Netflix lobbyist Josh Korn. The center told us it has not done a more complete analysis of lobbyist contributions to Sanders. But we found that some larger donations were made in previous campaigns.  Among those listed in Sanders’ 2016 presidential campaign filings with the Federal Election Commission: Oscar Ramirez, then a lobbyist with the Podesta Group: $650. Ramirez’s 2016 clients included Google holding company Alphabet, Oracle Corp. and the American Health Care Association, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Michael Correia, lobbyist for the National Cannabis Industry Association, whose members include corporations: $500. Amanda Aspatore, lobbyist for the National Mining Association, which represents corporations involved in mining: $250. Sanders campaign spokeswoman Sarah Ford told the Washington Post in September 2019: ""In 2016, we held zero closed-door fundraisers with high-dollar donors and accepted no donations from corporate PACs, corporate lobbyists or super PACs."" There are also a number of corporate lobbyists who gave to Sanders in his campaigns for the Senate. Some examples: Jeffrey Forbes, whose 2006 clients included AT&T, Northwest Airlines and Amgen Inc.; 2006 contributions: $2,000.  Martin Paone, whose 2009 clients included the American Council of Life Insurers, the American Petroleum Institute and Anheuser-Busch InBev; contributions in 2009 ($500) and 2011 ($1,000). William Frymoyer, whose 2006 clients included the U.S. Business & Industry Council, the Florida Trade Council and Gates Corp.; contributions in 2006: $250. Representatives for Ocasio-Cortez and for Sanders’ campaign did not reply to our requests for information. Ocasio-Cortez said Sanders has ""never taken corporate lobbyist money in his entire political career.""  In at least a few cases during his campaigns for Senate and president, Sanders did accept contributions in the hundreds of dollars, or thousands, from registered lobbyists who represent corporations.

Next to those two images is one more that reads simply ""5G"" —  a reference to the fifth-generation of wireless networking technology. These ominous pictures accompany this headline on a story being shared widely on Facebook: ""Coronavirus Hoax: Fake Virus Pandemic Fabricated to Cover-Up Global Outbreak of 5G Syndrome."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Please strike this claim from your list of things to worry about: This is just one more coronavirus assertion without evidence. As we’ve mentioned before, the best available information is that this virus started with an animal. The article appears on the Millennium Report, an anti-5G website that includes a section on the rollout of 5G, which ""greatly endangers"" the health of  ""every person in the USA."" The article cites no verifiable evidence of this claim. Instead, it alleges that the coronavirus discovered in Wuhan, China, was ""staged to cover-up the public health crisis caused by the intensive 5G roll-out in Wuhan in 2019."" It attributes the information to an unnamed ""intelligence analyst and former U.S. Army officer."" 5G is the latest upgrade to wireless systems that deliver data to mobile phones and other devices. As in, faster, faster, faster. It involves the federal government selling wireless spectrum used for the technology and more cell towers being located in populated rather than rural areas.  Is there reason to worry about possible health effects? Perhaps. Joel Moskowitz, director of the Center for Family and Community Health in the School of Public Health at the University of California, Berkeley, supports a moratorium on 5G development. He wrote in Scientific American that there could be health effects and that research needs to be funded.  But other reports say fears are overblown: ""The vast majority of evidence says there’s no reason to pause deployments."" — Rod Waterhouse, an electrical engineer, wireless-communications entrepreneur and editor of a report on 5G, speaking to the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers ""There’s little reason to think 5G frequencies are any more harmful than other types of electromagnetic radiation, like visible light."" — Wired magazine ""The 5G Health Hazard That Isn’t — How one scientist and his inaccurate chart led to unwarranted fears of wireless technology."" — New York Times headline These concerns about 5G aside, there is no evidence that the coronavirus has anything to do with wireless technology. The current coronavirus — which causes the respiratory disease known as COVID-19 — is spreading internationally. As of March 8, 2020, it had been detected in more than 100,000 people in more than 100 countries, including in the United States. Here’s what we know about how it emerged in December 2019 in Wuhan, China: COVID-19 ""is a zoonotic virus"" — that is, it was spread from animals to humans — according to a report from 25 international experts, including some from China and the U.S., convened by the World Health Organization.  Bats ""appear to be the reservoir of COVID-19 virus,"" but the intermediate host or hosts — that is, how it went from bats to humans — has not been identified.  Such viruses often originate in bats, although they sometimes can jump to another species before infecting humans. Chinese researchers have found a possible link between COVID-19 and pangolins, a mammal entirely covered in scales. Early on, many of the patients in Wuhan had some link to a large seafood and live animal market, suggesting animal-to-person spread, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Later, a growing number of patients reportedly did not have exposure to animal markets, indicating person-to-person spread. 
The headline of an article shared on Facebook claimed, without verifiable evidence: ""Coronavirus Hoax: Fake Virus Pandemic Fabricated to Cover-Up Global Outbreak of 5G Syndrome.""

Video shared by Trump omits full context of Biden’s comments
","President Donald Trump shared a deceptively edited video that made it appear former Vice President Joe Biden supported Trump’s re-election. For the first time, Twitter applied its new policy and labeled the video as ""manipulated media,"" though it could still be viewed on Twitter without the warning label. On March 7, Dan Scavino, an assistant to Trump and the White House’s director of social media, tweeted a 13-second video of Biden speaking at a campaign event in Missouri: ""Sleepy Joe in St. Louis, Missouri today: ‘We can only re-elect @realDonaldTrump.’"" Sleepy Joe💤in St. Louis, Missouri today:“We can only re-elect @realDonaldTrump.”#KAG2020LandslideVictory🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/FT4q2MWfcD The video tweet was viewed more than 6 million times and drew retweets from Trump. ""I agree with Joe!"" tweeted Trump. He also retweeted the video clip posted by conservative activist Charlie Kirk and a later tweet by Scavino.   I agree with Joe! https://t.co/h84mD7jVPW By cutting what Biden said before and after this clip, the video distorts the meaning of what Biden said. We contacted the White House and did not get a response. Scavino tweeted March 9 that ""the video was NOT manipulated.""  Biden was speaking in Kansas City (not St. Louis, as Scavino said) on March 7 when he made the speech in question.  Biden clearly stumbled over his words as he spoke during part of the speech. But it’s clear that he wasn’t calling for Trump to get re-elected. (Start at the 13:20 mark for a full minute listen.) Biden’s point was to call on Democrats to unite as a party and avoid attacks on each other to aim to defeat Trump.  ""If you want a nominee who will beat Donald Trump, keep the House of Representatives and elect the Senate, help me out. If you want a nominee who is a Democrat, a lifelong Democrat, a proud Democrat, an Obama-Biden Democrat, join us. If you want a nominee who will bring this   party together, who will run a progressive, positive campaign and turn this primary from a campaign that’s about negative attacks into one about what we are for, because we cannot get re-elect, we cannot win this re-election. Excuse me. We can only re-elect Donald Trump if in fact we get engaged in this circular firing squad here. It's got to be a positive campaign. So join us. Folks, we are building a coalition…"" Speaking in St. Louis earlier in the day, Biden made the same point without stumbling over his words: ""If you want a nominee who will bring the party together, who will run a positive, progressive vision for the future — not turn this primary into a campaign of negative attacks because that will only re-elect Donald Trump if we go that route."" Twitter added the label of ""manipulated media"" to the Scavino tweet on March 8 under a new policy. The policy applies to synthetic and manipulated media including videos, audio and images. The ""manipulated media"" warning beneath the tweet was not showing up in tweet detail, but it is visible in the timeline. Twitter said it was working on a fix.
   On Facebook, Scavino’s video was labeled ""partly false"" after it was reviewed by fact-checkers. PolitiFact is also part of the fact-checking partnership with Facebook. ""Fact-checkers rated this video as partly false, so we are reducing its distribution and showing warning labels with more context for people who see it, try to share it, or already have,"" Facebook said in a statement. ""As we announced last year, the same applies if a politician shares the video, if it was otherwise fact-checked when shared by others on Facebook.""  A White House video showed 13 seconds of Biden speaking at a campaign event when he said ""we can only re-elect Donald Trump."" Biden did make that statement as he stumbled over his words. But the video snippet omitted what Biden said immediately before and after, which removes his meaning. Biden’s overall point was to call for Democratic Party unity and to run a positive campaign, rather than intra-party attacks. The video stripped that out.

What caused voting delays in Texas on Super Tuesday?
","Hours after Super Tuesday polls closed in Texas at 7 p.m., voters across the state were still standing in lines to cast their ballots. In one North Texas county, Democratic primary voters reported long lines while Republican voters cast ballots with ease. In Austin, people reported lengthy waits throughout the day and some were still waiting to vote at 10:15 p.m. At Texas Southern University in Houston, the last Democratic voter cast his ballot at 1 a.m. Wednesday. In an appearance on NBC’s ""The Tonight Show"" Wednesday, Hillary Clinton remarked on the long lines in Texas. ""It is so wrong what is being done to try and purge people from voting lists, not let them register or, as we saw in places yesterday, particularly in Texas: The Republican side gets 25 machines, the Democratic side gets five machines,"" Clinton said. ""People were literally standing in line for seven hours. I want to applaud everybody that stood in a line yesterday, because they were doing the right thing for our country. Clinton is right that some voters in Texas stood in line for hours to vote on Tuesday, but is she right about the cause? Were more machines allocated to Republican primary voters than to Democrats in Texas? Clinton’s team did not return a request for comment. Differences by county In Texas, elections are conducted at the local level and procedures differ in each of the state’s 254 counties. For example, in Travis, Harris and Tarrant counties, voters can go to any polling place within the county to vote in the primary and general elections. In other counties, voters are restricted to polling places within the precincts where they live. During primary elections, both political parties work with election officials to agree on how the elections are run — including selecting the number of polling places and how voting machines are allocated. In Travis County, which also saw long lines, Democrats and Republicans can vote using the same machines at any polling place during the primary.  Some polling places in the county saw staffing disruptions early in the day that caused delays, as eleven people responsible for opening different polling locations did not show up for work over fears of catching the coronavirus. In Harris County, an equal number of voting machines for each party was placed at every polling place. Michael Winn, Harris County’s elections supervisor, told the Austin American-Statesman that this created longer lines for Democratic voters since the Democratic ballot drew more interest than the Republican one, and the county has more Democratic voters. Winn said people in Harris County voted in the Democratic primary at a 2-to-1 ratio compared with Republicans — but two-thirds of voting centers were located in Republican commissioner districts. Local party officials expressed trepidation at Harris County’s plan to divide voting machines equally in emails obtained by the Houston Chronicle. In one Feb. 18 message to county staff, Donna Stanart, the primary election director for the Republican Party wrote: ""A 50/50 split will be a problem at the polls that are going to be heavier for Democrats or heavier for Republicans."" Harris County Clerk Diane Trautman said in a statement that officials initially believed they were being ""fair and equitable by allocating equal amounts of equipment to each party."" In Tarrant County, election officials warned of long lines on Super Tuesday after local party officials agreed to have a set number of voting machines for each party, based on a review of past voter turnout data. The plan called for 1,015 Democratic machines and 1,767 Republican machines across the county’s 192 polling sites, according to the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. State lawmakers plan to hold a hearing to investigate the excessive wait times voters experienced and other issues reported by news outlets on Super Tuesday. In a letter to the Texas secretary of state and a handful of local election administrators urging action on improving voting infrastructure in the state, Mimi Marziani, president of the nonprofit Texas Civil Rights Project, outlined the different issues voters experienced on Super Tuesday. ""From the time polls opened to when they closed, voters faced a series of obstacles: polling sites that opened hours late or not at all; broken voting machines and ballot-printers; crashed election websites; too many untrained poll workers; and voters’ names missing from the registration rolls,"" she wrote. ""Then, especially later in the day, many voters in our major cities faced absurdly long wait times due to an inadequate number of polling locations, a lack of operational machines per location, and the failure to properly staff each location. As chronicled by numerous press reports, wait times lasted as long as seven hours at points, particularly in communities of color and on college campuses."" Our Ruling Clinton said that voters in Texas had to wait in long lines because ""the Republican side gets 25 machines, the Democratic side gets five machines."" Clinton is right that people in Texas waited for hours to vote, but she’s off on the polling machine disparity. In the county that experienced the longest lines on Super Tuesday, a main problem was the opposite of what Clinton described: a local decision to provide an equal number of machines for Republicans and Democrats at each voting location.

"['Guns', 'Joe Biden']","
Did Bernie Sanders vote against the Brady Bill five times?
","Former Vice President Joe Biden went after his presidential campaign rival, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., over gun policy during an interview with NBC’s Savannah Guthrie. Sanders ""voted against the Brady Bill five times for background checks on people,"" Biden said in the March 5 interview. The Brady Bill line was also an attack that Sanders’ 2016 presidential rival, Hillary Clinton, used, and Biden, like Clinton before him, is correct about the number of times Sanders voted against the landmark gun law, which among other things would have tightened background check requirements. However, Biden’s assertion glosses over the fact that Sanders now supports tighter background checks. RELATED: Bernie Sanders’ complicated record on guns Before it became law in 1993, the Brady bill underwent many transformations. Sanders, then Vermont’s sole representative in the U.S. House of Representatives, voted against the bill in its entirety five times: 1. In May 1991, Sanders voted against a version that mandated a seven-day waiting period. The bill passed in the House.   2. The Senate then voted to decrease the waiting period to five days, and the bill returned to the House. In November 1991, Sanders voted against that version. Although it passed in the House, the Senate didn’t muster enough votes for the new version. 3. After some back and forth, a bill resurfaced that reinstated the five-day waiting period. In November 1993, Sanders voted against that version twice in the same day.  4. Sanders voted against an amendment that would have ended state waiting periods, and for an amendment giving those denied a gun the right to know why. 5. The final compromise version of the Brady bill —  an interim five-day waiting period while installing an instant background check system — was passed and signed into law on Nov. 30, 1993. Sanders voted against it. The Sanders campaign told PolitiFact in 2015 that Sanders voted against the bill because he believed a national waiting period was a federal overreach and because he was answering to his constituents. Sanders’ early votes against the Brady Bill reflected his constituents’ views on guns in the rural state of Vermont. Sanders has also voted to allow firearms on Amtrak trains and in National Parks. ""He wasn't opposed to states having (waiting periods) if they wanted to. The Republicans wanted to repeal waiting periods in states that had them, and Bernie voted that down,"" Sanders aide Jeff Weaver told us at the time. ""He said he would be against waiting periods, and he kept his word to the people of Vermont."" In recent years, Sanders has moved closer to an anti-gun position that is more in line with the norms within the Democratic Party. Sanders has voted in favor of banning assault weapons, closing the gun show loophole, regulating high capacity magazines, and expanding background checks, spokesman Michael Briggs told PolitiFact in 2015. And over the past 15 years, he has received mixed marks from the National Rifle Association, ranging from a C-minus to F. His most recent pro-gun vote came in 2009. Early in the 2016 campaign, Sanders sounded something of a middle-ground message, such as telling CNN’s Jake Tapper in July 2015 that ""we need a sensible debate about gun control which overcomes the cultural divide that exists in this country, and I think I can play an important role in this."" But later in the 2016 campaign, after primary rivals had hit him on his past votes, Sanders sharpened his anti-gun rhetoric and said he would repeal the law he previously voted for that blocks lawsuits against gunmakers. In his current presidential campaign, Sanders has made clear his support for tighter gun restrictions. On the issues page of his campaign website, Sanders promises to expand background checks, ban the sale and distribution of assault weapons, and prohibit high-capacity ammunition magazines, among other policies. Biden said Sanders ""voted against the Brady Bill five times for background checks on people."" Sanders did vote against the Brady bill, including a shifting mix of background check provisions, five times. The most recent of those votes took place 26 years ago. In his 2020 campaign, Sanders is fully supportive of expanded background checks and other gun control policies supported by a wide range of Democratic politicians.

Challenger’s account of Lipinski’s immigration record falls short
","Critics of U.S. Rep. Dan Lipinski, one of the last conservative Democrats in the House, often argue he is out of step with what they view as his constituents' more progressive values. The eight-term congressman’s record on hot-button issues including health care, abortion and immigration has become a central focus in the March 17 primary challenge for the 3rd District seat he now holds. One attack on Lipinski’s immigration record caught our attention because it suggests the congressman is aligned with some of Republican President Donald Trump’s most controversial policies. A graphic tweeted by challenger Rush Darwish, who runs a multimedia production company in Chicago, said Lipinski ""voted against the DREAM Act, supports separating families and banning Muslims."" The 3rd District is the state’s most Arab American district, according to experts. And Darwish, who is Palestinian American, has said Lipinski has ignored the interests of immigrant communities there. Lipinski’s 2010 vote against legislation that would have protected ""Dreamers"" — the nickname for immigrants brought to the country illegally as children — from deportation, has been widely reported. But we didn’t know what Darwish was referencing when he claimed Lipinski backed ""separating families and banning Muslims."" So we decided to find out. There’s a lot to unpack in Darwish’s claim, so we’ll start with its clearest contention. First introduced in 2001, the DREAM Act not only would have prevented the deportation of Dreamers, but also would have provided a path to citizenship. In 2010, Lipinski was one of 38 Democrats to vote against the bill, which passed the House but died in the Senate. Since then, however, Lipinski has taken steps to protect the beneficiaries of a similar program instituted by former President Barack Obama and has more recently backed new legislation that resembles the bill he voted against. Obama’s Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, offered Dreamers temporary protection from deportation but did not include a path to citizenship. In 2017, Trump moved to end DACA. His administration is still required to process renewal applications for immigrants who have been granted DACA and want to renew that protection, but the government is not allowing new applicants to apply. Lipinski signed on to a letter that year requesting Trump continue DACA and told the Sun-Times he would support legislation to protect the program. And in 2019, he co-sponsored and helped pass a House bill to protect DACA recipients. The legislation, which is unlikely to secure Senate approval, would provide a path to citizenship for Dreamers and other immigrants with temporary legal status. In April 2018, Trump’s Justice Department introduced a ""zero tolerance"" policy that called for prosecuting all adults referred by immigration authorities for violating immigration laws. As a consequence of that policy, children were separated from their parents as they arrived at the border. Lipinski criticized those separations at the time and signed on to several letters questioning the government’s actions. Last year, he also co-sponsored legislation aimed at limiting family separations near the border. But a Darwish spokesperson told us his candidate’s tweet wasn’t talking about those separations. ""We are referring to Congressman Lipinski's vote against the DREAM Act,"" spokesperson Andrew Patinkin wrote in an email. ""Lipinski effectively voted in favor of the separation of families because when undocumented people are brought to the United States as children and are not provided a path to legal residency, they may very well be deported."" Even by that logic, Lipinski clearly reversed course on providing legal residency to Dreamers. Shortly after taking office, Trump signed an executive order temporarily suspending immigration from seven Muslim-majority nations and the U.S. refugee program. Lipinski decried the president’s order in a press release at the time, calling it ""ill conceived and harmful to innocent individuals."" Instead of pointing to evidence Lipinski supports Trump’s travel ban, a version of which was upheld by the Supreme Court in 2018, Darwish’s spokesman cited the congressman’s absence from the list of cosponsors for a bill that would limit the president’s authority to restrict residents of other countries from entering the United States. When we asked Lipinski’s campaign if he planned to support the bill, spokesperson Sally Daly told us he intends to vote for it. Daly also said he became a co-sponsor ""this week,"" but did not provide a specific date. The list now shows he was added on March 5, the same day we spoke with her. Darwish’s tweet claims Lipinski ""voted against the DREAM Act, supports separating families and banning Muslims."" Lipinski did vote against the DREAM Act in 2010. But he now supports legislation to provide similar protections to immigrants brought to the country illegally as children. He has been a longtime critic of a Trump policy that resulted in children being separated from their families along the border and of the president’s travel ban affecting people from Muslim-majority nations. Darwish’s claim contains some truth in citing Lipinski’s vote against the DREAM Act, but it gives a misleading impression overall of the congressman’s current stance on key immigration issues. We rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

What's missing in Pence’s statement about insurance coverage for coronavirus testing?
","Amid ongoing concern about the new coronavirus, Vice President Mike Pence sought to assure Americans that their health insurance will cover the tests needed for diagnosis.  ""With regard to the cost, let me be very clear: HHS has designated the coronavirus test as an essential health benefit. That means, by definition, it's covered in the private health insurance of every American, as well as covered by Medicare and Medicaid."" That got us wondering about Pence’s assurance. Can he really claim that this designation means that all Americans with private health insurance, Medicare and Medicaid will be covered?  And, is there a difference between coverage and cost? First, what are ""essential benefits"" and why does that matter? We reached out to the vice president’s office for details about his comments but got no reply. However, we also consulted with a range of experts, who helped us fill in the blanks. ""There are many things wrong with the statement,"" said Christen Linke Young, a fellow with the USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy. For one thing, many Americans’ insurance policies don’t have to include coverage of essential health benefits, but more on that later. Still, as Young and other experts helped us piece together the details, it became increasingly clear that this testing will ultimately be covered by most Americans’ health insurance. But, it is not a simple process ― the actual cost to patients is the biggest uncertainty ― and making it happen will require steps not only by the federal government, as Pence suggested, but also by state regulators and private insurers. Under the Affordable Care Act, insurance plans covering individuals and small employers must provide coverage of 10 essential health benefits (EHBs), including prescription drugs, maternity care, hospital care and laboratory services. Lab services could include diagnostic tests for, say, influenza, strep throat or even coronavirus. But there isn’t a master list of all the tests covered. ""They don’t say we only cover these particular diagnostic tests,"" said Young. ""It’s a broad category of coverage."" So HHS probably does not have to designate the COVID-19 test as an EHB for it to be covered. HHS did not respond to a question from us about whether it had, indeed, designated coronavirus testing as an EHB. States, because they regulate insurers within their borders, are also weighing in to add clarity. New York and California, for example, have ordered insurers to cover coronavirus testing and waive patient costs. It also should be noted that Pence’s invoking of EHBs relies on the ACA, even as the administration has been a constant and staunch opponent of the law. ""The irony is great with this coming from an administration that has done everything it can to repeal the ACA, roll back essential health benefits and promote short-term plans that don’t cover much,"" said Sabrina Corlette, a research professor at the Center on Health Insurance Reforms at Georgetown University. But there’s another, bigger catch: EHBs apply only to a limited number of insurance plans ― those ACA-compliant plans purchased by individuals and small employers, which are defined as businesses with fewer than 50 employees.    The requirements don’t apply to many workplace plans (including those provided by large businesses and self-insured plans), even though  most Americans ― about 157 million ― who have health insurance get it through their job. Most of these plans, though, do cover a wide range of benefits, including laboratory services, but they are not required by law to do so. Coronavirus testing would likely be lumped in, especially as ""employers likewise very much want COVID under control and do not want it spreading through their workforces,"" said James Gelfand, senior vice president at  the ERISA Industry Committee, which represents large employers. Private insurers are beginning to move in this direction, too. America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry’s lobbying group, said in early March its members will cover diagnostic testing when ordered by a physician and will ""take action to ease network, referral, and prior authorization requirements and/or waive patient cost sharing."" And what about Americans who have purchased alternative forms of insurance? The ACA’s rules ― including those on essential benefits ― don’t apply to several types of insurance that the Trump administration has promoted, including short-term plans. Such plans have lower premiums than ACA plans, mainly because they don’t have to offer a wide range of benefits or meet other ACA rules. Consumers should ""read the fine print to see what is in and what is out,"" said Corlette. Short-term plans also can cap annual treatment payment amounts, reject people with medical conditions ― or review their medical records after they make a claim to see if they had a preexisting condition that could disqualify them for coverage. Meanwhile, EHB rules don’t apply to Medicare. But that federal health insurance program for seniors and the disabled  has made clear on its website that it will cover the test, saying ""this test is covered when your doctor or other health care provider orders it, if you got the test on or after February 4, 2020."" The agency that oversees Medicaid, the state-federal low-income health insurance program, issued a release saying that ""testing and diagnostic services are commonly covered"" and that lab tests are a ""mandatory benefit."" No, coverage and cost are not the same. And that’s the key issue for policy and health experts. For those who have not yet hit their annual deductible, ""the full cost of diagnostic tests will fall on those who get them,"" said Nicholas Bagley, a professor at University of Michigan Law School. ""That will discourage some people from getting tested in the first place, which is a public health nightmare."" Many private plans, both those offered by employers and those purchased by individuals, include deductibles that enrollees must meet before full coverage kicks in. Even after a deductible is satisfied, many plans also require some sort of copayment ― be it $10, $25 or more ― when seeing a doctor or going for a lab test. For emergency room visits, the cost sharing is higher. If insurers don’t waive cost sharing for the test, it could be an issue for some consumers.   Still, Bagley said, the federal government is limited in its ability to order insurers or employers to waive patient payments, at least in the short term. Longer term, federal officials could seek to declare the tests ""preventive services,"" like mammograms or vaccines, which are free for insured patients. But that process would take more than a year to implement. In the meantime, it’s mainly up to insurers and employers to decide what to do. Cigna has announced it will waive patient costs for testing ― and others may soon as well, given AHIP’s statement. Another group, the Alliance of Community Health Plans, which represents nonprofit plans, didn’t specifically say its members would waive fees but pledged to ""ensure affordability is not a barrier to the individuals who are recommended for testing by their doctor or a public health authority."" Pence said ""HHS has designated the coronavirus test as an essential health benefit. That means, by definition, it's covered in the private health insurance of every American, as well as covered by Medicare and Medicaid."" There are a number of moving parts to this statement, but it tends to leave out important details. For instance, many private and employer health plans have flexibility about what benefits they cover and what consumers will pay. In addition, coverage does not necessary mean low cost.   Bottom line: Pence's comment is an overstatement. It fails to acknowledge the need for action at the state level and from the private sector, too. For these reasons, we rate this claim as Half True.  ",/factchecks/2020/mar/06/mike-pence/pences-statement-about-insurance-coverage-coronavi/

Donald Trump wrong saying Barack Obama did nothing about swine flu

","Asked about reassuring Americans about the coronavirus, President Donald Trump downplayed the number of people stricken, then went on the attack. Without mentioning President Barack Obama, Trump criticized the Obama’s administration response to another outbreak — H1N1, commonly known as swine flu. Trump made the attack during an interview on March 4, 2020, with Fox News talk show host Sean Hannity: Hannity: ""You have said that you are evaluating (the coronavirus) on a daily basis. ... What are we prepared as a country to do to keep our citizens safe?"" Trump: ""Well, I just say that it's, you know, a very, very small number in this country. And we're going to try and keep it that way as much as possible. I will say, though, the H1N1 — that was swine flu, commonly referred to as swine flu — and that went from around April of '09 to April of '10, where there were 60 million cases of swine flu. And over — actually, it's over 13,000. I think you might have said 17—. I had heard it was 13—, but a lot of — a lot of deaths. And they didn't do anything about it."" We wanted to fact-check Trump’s claim that the Obama administration ""didn't do anything"" as millions of swine flu cases mounted. The Trump campaign didn’t respond to our requests for information. The H1N1 influenza virus was discovered in the United States in the spring of 2009 and spread around the world.  It was originally referred to as ""swine flu"" because many genes in the virus were similar to influenza viruses that normally occur in pigs in North America. From April 12, 2009, to April 10, 2010, in the United States, there were 60.8 million cases of swine flu, as well as 274,304 hospitalizations and 12,469 deaths, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated. Obama’s acting director of health and human services declared H1N1 a public health emergency on April 26, 2009. That was when the United States had only 20 confirmed cases of H1N1 and no deaths. Two days later, the administration made an initial funding request for H1N1 to Congress. Eventually $7.65 billion was allocated for a vaccine and other measures. On Oct. 24, 2009, six months after his administration declared H1N1 a public health emergency, Obama declared it a national emergency.  By then, H1N1 had claimed more than 1,000 American lives, according to the CDC. When Obama made his declaration, thousands of people were lining up in cities across the country to receive vaccinations, as federal officials acknowledged that their vaccination program had gotten off to a slow start, with some states having requested 10 times the amount they had been allotted, the New York Times reported at the time. The national emergency declaration allowed the federal government to temporarily waive or modify requirements of the Medicare, Medicaid, and State Children's Health Insurance programs. It also permitted doctors and hospitals to bypass certain requirements as they responded to H1N1. Trump said: ""There were 60 million cases of swine flu"" during the Obama administration ""and they didn't do anything about it."" His assessment on the nation’s response is incorrect. The Obama administration issued two emergency declarations, triggering billions of dollars in spending toward vaccines and other public health response measures.

Trump wrongly blames Obama for limits on coronavirus testing
","In remarks at the White House, President Donald Trump faulted his predecessor for making it harder for the government to ramp up testing for the coronavirus, or COVID-19. ""The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we’re doing, and we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion,"" Trump said. ""That was a decision we disagreed with. I don’t think we would have made it, but for some reason it was made. But we’ve undone that decision."" When reporters asked, the White House pointed to a February Food and Drug Administration policy that relaxed the rules on tests for coronavirus developed in labs. The change allowed labs to start using ""COVID-19 diagnostics"" while they are waiting for the FDA to approve their testing procedure. The FDA laid out specific steps for labs to follow to show that their method for spotting the virus held up under scrutiny. The change applied only to labs that met the highest standard, those that are ""certified to perform high-complexity testing."" The FDA’s policies here go back many years and fall under the umbrella of Emergency Use Authorization, a fast-track for deploying medical help when time was of the essence and waiting for the normal approval process made no sense. The FDA has general guidance for using medical treatments that haven’t gone through the usual clearance process. Emergency Use Authorization dates back to 2004 during the administration of George W. Bush.  As part of American counterterrorism policy, Congress passed the Project BioShield Act of 2004. It allowed the FDA to issue Emergency Use Authorizations so diagnostic tests and treatments could be shared faster during a health emergency. The law was extended in 2006 and reauthorized in 2013. Basically, a lab or a drug maker could tell the FDA it had a promising approach, apply for an emergency authorization, and the FDA would move as quickly as possible to approve or disapprove the proposal. The FDA has a lot of flexibility in how it oversees these emergency authorizations. It issues guidance, not to be confused with hard and fast regulations. The guidance from the FDA in 2007, before Obama took office, is very similar to the one in 2017 at the very end of the Obama administration. Both stress the need for speed and encourage labs to start talking to the FDA as early as possible before they submit their application to reduce the turnaround time. The FDA lays out what it wants to see in an application, but in case a lab can’t provide that in ""a timely manner,"" the FDA ""will accept and evaluate the request for an EUA based on data in the form the sponsor is able to submit,"" according to the 2017 guidance. ""They could turn them around in a day or two, depending on how similar it was to an existing use,"" said Alta Charo, professor of law at the University of Wisconsin and an advisor to the FDA in the first two years of the Obama administration. There’s a second, narrower track. It has to do with a subset of the Emergency Use Authorization that applies to what are called Laboratory Developed Tests. Those are tests used in individual labs, and the FDA policy has been that these tests ""should not be used for clinical diagnoses without FDA’s approval, clearance, or authorization during an emergency declaration.""  But the FDA’s authority over those Laboratory Developed Tests was always in a legal gray zone. ""This was not legally binding,"" said University of Missouri law professor Erika Lietzan. ""The FDA never had clear jurisdiction, and the people working at the FDA never enforced the policy. The whole thing is just a recommendation."" That is the policy the Trump administration modified. These labs need to apply, but they can start using their tests before they get the green light from the FDA. ""They could have rolled the policy back further,"" Lietzan said. ""They still want the labs to apply."" There was no change in policy regarding these labs under the Obama administration. ""Trump’s statement on this has been puzzling,"" said Jeff Gibbs, an attorney who focuses on FDA law and represents many labs. ""FDA has had a long-standing policy of generally not regulating Laboratory Developed Tests, but reserved the right to regulate them under certain circumstances."" Gibbs said that policy goes back to 1997, pre-dating the post-9/11 laws, and hasn’t changed since. In 2006, the FDA issued guidance for emergency humanitarian use of diagnostic tests. It offered conditional approval for up to one year. The Obama administration followed that policy, but in 2010, it signaled that it wanted to affirm the FDA’s authority. The FDA began a long process of adding new guidelines for these labs. It offered a draft version in 2014, but in November 2016, it said the effort had ended, and the new guidelines never took effect. There was no change of policy under Obama. We reached out to the White House and did not hear back. Trump said the Obama administration made a decision that ""turned out to be very bad"" for detecting the COVID-19 virus. The White House pointed to a new FDA policy that made it easier for labs to use their own methods to detect the COVID-19 virus. But the FDA never had firm legal authority over those labs.  The new policy still asks labs to apply for Emergency Use Authorization. The shift is that once they apply, they can get to work before getting the nod from the FDA. The policy that had been in place had its roots in guidance that dates to at least 2007, and before that, to a 2004 law, before Obama took office.

While unofficial tax calculators have cropped online purporting to show the tax implications of Sanders’ plans, experts told us there simply isn’t enough data yet on Sanders’ tax proposals to determine how much in additional taxes a particular taxpayer might have to pay. Sanders says that within six months, his proposal would cancel the $1.64 trillion in student debt owed by 45 million Americans, saving a typical borrower $3,000 per year. The $3,000 is based on 2018 government data that shows the typical monthly payment is between $200 and $299 per month.  His legislation, rolled out in June 2019, applies to loans that were made, insured or guaranteed by the federal government. It’s the same proposal Sanders makes in his presidential campaign. Sanders would pay for the cancellation by imposing a new tax on securities transactions, or what Sanders calls ""Wall Street speculation,"" to generate what his campaign says would be more than $2.4 trillion over the next decade. Specifically, he would place a 0.5% tax on stock trades — 50 cents on every $100 of stock — a 0.1% fee on bond trades and a 0.005% fee on derivatives trades. Looking at the investment tax alone, a person would have to buy or sell $1.08 million worth of stock per year in order to incur $5,400 in new tax liabilities, said Andrew Reschovsky, professor emeritus of public affairs and applied economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""I suspect that there are not many holders of outstanding student loan debt that could afford financial transactions of this magnitude,"" he told us. But the investment tax is not the only new one Sanders has proposed.  A calculator on a pro-Sanders website, bernietax.com, estimates that a single person making $250,000 per year and currently paying $3,000 in health costs would lose $5,500 per year in disposable income due to a 4% Sanders tax proposes as one way to pay for his Medicare for All proposal. So as far as this calculator is concerned, there is a way to get to the figure used in the Facebook post. But the tax calculator ""is a complete black box,"" Reschovsky told us. ""There is no indication about what assumptions are made and how the calculations are carried out."" Moreover, Sanders is proposing several trillion dollars’ worth of tax increases, but those proposals haven’t been scored in enough detail to know whether $5,400 per year in extra taxes is an accurate estimate for a particular person, said Tax Foundation economist Erica York.  ""It is beyond impossible to know how much he'd pay under Sanders' tax plan,"" said Howard Gleckman, senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ""And his tax bill would vary dramatically depending on how much money he made and how he made it."" 
A Facebook post said: ""I pay $165 a month on my student loans for the next 13 years to pay them off. With Bernie Sanders’ plan, my student loans will be forgiven. I’ll only have to pay $450 extra in taxes a month for the next 25 years to make sure I’ll have no more student debt."" Sanders’ various proposals to raise taxes have not been scored out in enough detail to determine how much more any given taxpayer might pay.

Asteroid ‘on approach’ to Earth will miss by 3.9 million miles
","An article shared on Facebook suggested that an asteroid on its way toward Earth could be cataclysmic. ""Asteroid warning: NASA tracks a 4KM killer rock on approach  — Could end human civilisation,"" reads the headline. The headline was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article is by the Daily Express, a British newspaper. It quotes NASA as saying the asteroid, 1998 OR2, will make a ""close approach"" to Earth on April 29, 2020. But later, the article essentially contradicts the headline, saying ""close"" means within 3.9 million miles. Yeah, not so close. NASA’s Center for Near Earth Object Studies in Pasadena, Calif., which computes asteroid and comet orbits and their odds of Earth impact, is tracking 1998 OR2. It estimates the asteroid is up to 4.1 kilometers in diameter, or 2.5 miles. If your memories of astronomy class are hazy, remember that an asteroid is a rocky body orbiting the Sun, left over from the formation of the solar system more than 4 billion years ago. Asteroids range in size from small boulders to hundreds of miles in diameter. Usually, they are too small to survive the passage through Earth’s atmosphere. When these burn up on their descent, they leave a beautiful trail of light known as a meteor or ""shooting star.""  But larger asteroids have crashed into Earth and created craters, such as a site off the coast of the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, buried by ocean sediments today. It ""is believed to be a record of the event that led to the extinction of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago,"" according to NASA. NASA announced its discovery of 1998 OR2 and another asteroid, 1998 OH, in August 1998.  The space agency said both asteroids ""cross Earth's orbital path"" and are ""large enough to cause global effects if one impacted Earth."" But it said they show ""no signs of coming dangerously close to Earth within at least the next several decades."" On March 4, 2020, the center posted this tweet:  ""On April 29, asteroid 1998 OR2 will safely pass Earth by 3.9 million miles/6.2 million km. A @Daily_Express article implying there is a ‘warning’ about this asteroid is false. A complete listing of all asteroid passes is always public at http://cneos.jpl.nasa.gov/ca. Carry on!"" The center’s directorr, Paul Chodas, told us by email: ""We have been tracking this asteroid for decades, and we have lots of data! But, there is no chance at all that this asteroid can impact!"" Suggesting imminent danger, the headline of an article shared on Facebook claimed that NASA is tracking a 2.5-mile-wide asteroid approaching Earth that ""could end human civilisation."" An asteroid ""large enough to cause global effects"" if it hit Earth is expected to cross Earth’s orbital path on April 29, 2020. But it ""will safely pass Earth by 3.9 million miles,"" says NASA, which called the headline false. That’s our ruling — False.",/factchecks/2020/mar/05/facebook-posts/asteroid-approach-earth-will-miss-39-million-miles/
