On school supply funding, Cooper leaves out important context
","Gov. Roy Cooper has repeatedly said the state isn’t doing enough to provide teachers with the supplies they need. Classroom equipment and supply funding has fallen by tens of millions of dollars over the past decade and, in response, Cooper has pushed legislative leaders for more funding and even held his own school supply drive. Republicans hold a supermajority in the North Carolina legislature and recently passed their budget plan mostly without the help of Democrats. Since then, Democrats have criticized Republicans for what they see as ""pork"" in the budget. Cooper made one such attack on May 30, when he tweeted a graphic that reads: ""One legislative Republican’s district gets almost all the school supply funding."" Base vs. new funding Sadie Weiner, Cooper’s communications director, highlighted in an email a key distinction that’s not included in the tweet: It’s referring to new, additional funding — not the base budget for all school districts in the state. ""That tweet is talking about new school supply funding in the 2018-19 budget. Republicans will argue that their budget has $47 million for school supplies and instructional equipment. That is routine funding in the base budget, it is not new funding, and the Governor’s recommended budget includes the same $47 million,"" she wrote. ""The Governor included $15 million in new funding that would go directly to teachers in the form of a school supply stipend,"" Weiner continued. ""That money would go to all state-funded teachers, not just those in a single district as the Republican budget has done."" She referred to Senate District 41, represented by Cornelius Republican Jeff Tarte, who faces a competitive re-election race in November. The budget includes $200,000 for DonorsChoose.org, a New York-based nonprofit. The bill instructed the group to use the money on supplies for teachers in certain schools within Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools — all within Tarte’s district. Donors Choose declined the money, saying the grant didn’t provide ""equitable"" funding across the state. The Charlotte Observer posted a story about the group’s decision less than an hour after Cooper posted the tweet. While Cooper's tweet doesn't differentiate between base and new school supply funding, Weiner noted that Cooper was more specific in his press conference on Wednesday. The budget, he said, ""falls short on textbooks and digital learning, offers new schools supply money only to a few in-tech schools."" Other supply funding Jonathan Sink, an aide to House Speaker Tim Moore, said in an email that the budget provides five new grants for classroom supplies, materials and equipment. In addition to DonorsChoose, the following groups get money: · Franklin County Education Foundation: $60,000 to support grants for supplies to teachers in Franklin County Schools · Town of Holly Springs: $50,000 to support four programs, one of which is the Teacher Classroom Supply Program · Cary Chamber of Commerce: $25,000 to support a Cary Teacher Classroom Supply Program · Robeson County Career Center: $7,500 for purchase of classroom equipment at the Robeson County Career Center in the Public Schools of Robeson County. Our ruling Cooper tweeted: ""One legislative Republican’s district gets almost all the school supply funding."" Cooper has a point that budget writers designated a large portion of new school supply funding to schools in one Republican legislator’s district. But his tweet lacks important context, giving the impression that school districts might go without new school supplies this year — which isn’t true.

Justin Nelson tags Ken Paxton, Texas attorney general, as nation's sole indicted statewide official
","The Austin lawyer nominated by Democrats for state attorney general saw big-as-Texas significance in Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens announcing plans to resign. Justin Nelson said in a tweet posted the day that Greitens announced he’d resign on June 1, 2018: ""The Missouri Governor under indictment just quit. This means our Indicted Attorney General Ken Paxton is back to being the only statewide official in the country under indictment. Texans can make their decision to fire Indicted Ken Paxton in November."" Greitens, a Republican, revealed he’d resign weeks after being charged with felony computer tampering for allegedly using a list of donors to his charity, The Mission Continues, to raise campaign donations. As recapped by St. Louis Public Radio, that indictment occurred after KMOV-TV reported that the governor had had an extramarital affair and had allegedly taken a photo of the woman without her consent while she was bound and semi-nude. The governor, the woman said, then threatened to make the picture public if she talked about it. See Greitens’ resignation letter here. Paxton, a former state legislator running for a second term as Texas attorney general, was indicted on charges of securities fraud in the summer of 2015 though the case has been mired in a dispute over how much several appointed prosecutors will be paid. So, does Greitens’ move make Paxton the only statewide official in the U.S. under indictment? Nelson campaign says it found no one else We inquired into how Nelson reached his conclusion. By email, Sean Haynes of his campaign provided a spreadsheet listing statewide elected positions in all the states and followed up with a campaign document that Haynes said shows web searches conducted for indicted statewide officials in the 50 states. Over several months, Haynes said by phone, Nelson and campaign aides searched online for news reports or other indications of indictments of state officials before concluding that aside from Paxton and Greitens, no statewide elected officials were under indictment. The document indicates specific searches for the word ""indicted"" and the names of officials in each state across 14 job categories, starting with governor. Yanked charges in Oklahoma, Arizona Along with Paxton, the document indicates, an Oklahoma official was under indictment in 2016-17. Joy Hofmeister, Oklahoma’s elected state superintendent of public instruction, was indicted in November 2016 for allegedly raising campaign donations illegally and coordinating attack ads against her predecessor before the 2014 Republican primary, the Associated Press reported. But those felony charges were dropped Aug. 1, 2017, according to a news story in the Oklahoman. That story also quoted Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater saying the charges might be restored, ""pending further investigation."" Haynes also pointed out an August 2017 arrest in Arizona leading Joe Hart, Arizona’s elected mine inspector, to be accused of domestic violence after a fight with his nephew, the Arizona Republic reported. We followed up with the Kingman, Ariz., police department whose deputy chief, Rusty Cooper, replied by email that the misdemeanor charge against Hart was later dismissed by the city attorney’s office. Nobody tracks statewide officials under indictment Next, we searched for indictments of statewide officials in news stories compiled by the Nexis news database in 2017-18--and found no indications of indicted statewide officials beyond Paxton. We also reached out to the Associated Press, Governing magazine, the Almanac of American Politics and entities including the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Council of State Governments, the Center for Public Integrity, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington and the Institute for Corruption Studies at Illinois State University. No one said its researchers tracked indicted officials across the land. Our inquiries otherwise turned up a statewide elected official recently acquitted of criminal charges and another perhaps at risk of more scrutiny. CNN reported in January 2018 that after U.S. Sen. Bob Menendez, D-N.J., was acquitted of charges alleging Menendez had accepted bribes in return for political favors, the Justice Department planned to seek dismissal of remaining charges against him. That dismissal happened Jan. 31, 2018, according to a legal document emailed to us by Haynes. An AP editor, Tom Verdin, responded to us by noting that a federal judge in April 2018 found Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state, in contempt of court for failing to carry out the court’s orders in an elections matter. Perhaps Kobach is in hot water. Still, the AP’s news story on that finding by U.S. District Judge Julie Robinson quotes Moriah Day, a spokeswoman for Kobach’s campaign for governor,  saying the secretary of state’s office would appeal Robinson’s decision. Matt Welch, a spokesman for Paxton's campaign, had no comment on Nelson's claim. Our ruling Nelson tweeted that Paxton, his November foe, ""is back to being the only statewide official in the country under indictment.""

Fact-checking claim about National Guard, border apprehensions
","A website called Viral WDC said the deployment of the National Guard to the U.S.-Mexico border allowed immigration officials to arrest ""1,600 extra people"" trying to cross into the United States illegally. ""A major game-changing incident took place after the National Guard stormed the border to protect the immigration laws and defend citizens from having nearly 2,000 people break into America illegally. … Thanks to the National Guard arriving at the border to help lend a hand to the roving tribe of potential illegal immigrants, The U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers were able to arrest 1,600 extra people who were trying to allegedly cross the border illegally,"" said the May 14 post on Viral WDC, headlined ""National Guard storms Mexico border, makes game-changing impact in just 30 days."" Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Looking past the bluster of the headline, the story largely checks out. Government officials have credited National Guard troops at the border for contributing to the apprehension of 1,600 people, the capture of about 1,000 pounds of marijuana and 451 ""turn backs"" of individuals seeking to come into the United States illegally, CNN reported May 9, based on a conference call with CBP and National Guard officials. The Viral WDC story cites a Washington Examiner story that said, ""U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers have apprehended an additional 1,600 people attempting to illegally enter the country from Mexico since April 15 as a result of the deployment of National Guard troops to the southwest border."" Neither Viral WDC nor the Washington Examiner say what the 1,600 number is in addition to. The way the Viral WDC story is written suggests that 1,600 would not have been apprehended if the National Guard wasn’t assisting. But there’s no evidence to support that. CNN said a CBP official ""did not have comparison numbers available, so it was not possible to determine if those figures were substantially more than if National Guard troops had not been dispatched to the border."" Total apprehensions were up in April compared to March, but border apprehensions have been increasing since February. There were about 37,400 southwest border apprehensions in March, compared to approximately 38,300 in April, according to CBP. President Donald Trump on April 4 issued a memorandum so that the National Guard could help immigration officials stop the illegal entry of immigrants and illicit drugs. It’s important to note that the National Guard is not actually apprehending individuals. Instead, they are carrying out non-enforcement roles, serving as pilots, aerial observers, intelligence analysts, communications specialists, camera operators and vehicle mechanics. Defense Secretary James N. Mattis authorized the use of Defense Department funds to send up to 4,000 National Guard troops to the southern border to support U.S. Customs and Border Protection. He authorized the deployment through Sept. 30, the end of fiscal year 2018. The troops are deployed under Title 32 duty status, meaning they are under the command and control of their state governors but paid by the federal government and can undertake ""Homeland Defense activities."" There are now more than 1,800 National Guard troops who deployed starting in early April, U.S. Customs and Border protection spokesman Daniel Hetlage told PolitiFact on June 6. A Viral WDC story said, ""National Guard storms Mexico border, makes game-changing impact in just 30 days."" Officials have said that the deployment of the National Guard to the border has contributed to the apprehension of 1,600 people. The Viral WDC story said the deployment was a ""major game-changing incident"" and that it allowed the arrest of ""1,600 extra people."" While the National Guard’s support has enabled more agents to be on the ground to apprehend immigrants, it’s unclear if these are ""extra"" apprehensions or simply following the previous months’ trend.

Does North Korea's negotiating history mean it can't be trusted?
","The stakes could hardly be higher for President Donald Trump’s June 12 Singapore summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Given Pyongyang’s strides toward developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of reaching the United States, the question of whether an arms control deal will take shape looms large over the historic talks. Yet some say North Korea’s track record gives plenty of reason for skepticism when it comes to negotiating. ""The problem is that we know historically, going back to Kim Jong Un's grandfather, (that) these people lie, they're deceitful, they'll take the concessions, they'll keep them in their pocket and then they won't deliver,"" Fox News analyst Juan Williams said June 3 on Fox News Sunday. North Korea has shown nuclear ambitions since Kim Jong Un’s grandfather, Kim Il Sung, established the country in 1948. To date, North Korea is believed to possess up to 60 nuclear warheads. The country has conducted six nuclear tests and more than 100 missile tests, including intercontinental missiles. This, despite years of diplomatic engagement and international pressure placed on three generations of leaders — from Kim Il Sung to Kim Jong Il, to the regime’s current leader, Kim Jong Un, whom Trump called ""Little Rocket Man."" Arms control experts and political scientists we spoke to agreed with Williams’ broader point that skepticism is warranted when dealing with North Korea. But whether Pyongyang has a track record of double-dealing is a bit murkier. Williams, through a Fox News spokesperson, cited examples of what he said were deals, talks or agreements that broke down due to North Korea’s actions or inaction: The Agreed Framework deal in 1994 under the Clinton administration. North Korea promising to ""abandon nuclear weapons and existing nuclear programs"" during talks under the George W. Bush administration. The 2012 Leap Day agreement under the Barack Obama administration. Let’s look at each of these with a view towards whether North Korea behaved duplicitously. Former President Bill Clinton negotiated a deal in 1994 with North Korea, dubbed the ""Agreed Framework."" Under the pact, the country would scrap two plutonium-based nuclear reactors that the United States believed would be used to make fuel for a nuclear bomb. In exchange, Washington would give Pyongyang two alternate reactors less capable of producing bomb-making materials, as well as fuel. The pact would eventually crumble years later, but not before North Korea reaped a reward. ""In this agreement, the North Koreans did get very significant concessions from the U.S., South Korea and Japan, including a great deal of economic aid,"" said Joseph de Thomas, a former U.S. ambassador who worked on North Korea arms control issues as deputy assistant secretary of state for non-proliferation in the Clinton administration. In addition to heavy fuel oil, North Korea received massive investments in the two nuclear power reactors that were to be provided, as well as large scale donations of fertilizer and food. But experts noted that North Korea also made major concessions. Pyongyang rolled back its plutonium-based program and granted access to inspectors — and honored these commitments for eight years. ""Without that agreement, North Korea might have amassed enough plutonium for 50 to 100 nuclear bombs by the early 2000s,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association. ""Instead, they only had enough for less than 10."" The agreement unraveled in 2002 after North Korea admitted it was secretly working to produce a bomb — not through the plutonium route, but through a program based on highly enriched uranium. Experts say it’s debatable if North Korea’s uranium-based program was covered under the Agreed Framework (though it was certainly prohibited under supplemental agreements). Regardless of whether North Korea violated the letter of the agreement, experts say the country violated its spirit. Rather than negotiate with North Korea over its compliance issue, President George W. Bush ended the deal. ""The Bush administration chose to call the North Koreans cheaters and walk away from the Agreed Framework in a huff rather than working the process to deal with the violation,"" DeThomas said. ""It wanted out of the deal and used North Korean actions as the justification.""   At the same time, it’s important to note the United States could be faulted for not fully complying with its end of the bargain. For instance, Washington failed to deliver as scheduled the fuel oil it promised North Korea to compensate for the shuttered nuclear reactor. ""So they violated the spirit if not the letter of the agreement, and we didn’t do a perfect job of holding up our end either,"" said Marcus Noland, executive vice president and director of studies at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. According to Kimball, there were multiple reasons for the Agreed Framework’s collapse: delays in key U.S. commitments, Bush’s reluctance to continue the process and his labeling of North Korea as part of ""an axis of evil,"" and North Korea hedging its bets and cheating by pursuing technologies related to uranium enrichment. ""In essence, both sides gained benefits without fully delivering on their Agreed Framework commitments,"" Kimball said. The Agreed Framework fell apart around the end of 2002 when Pyongyang kicked weapons inspectors out of the country and resumed activity at its nuclear facilities. It also announced it would withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the only country ever to do so. North Korea’s withdrawal from the nonproliferation treaty gave rise to international discussion about Pyongyang’s nuclear program. Starting in 2003, the Six-Party Talks brought together North Korea and the United States, as well as South Korea, China, Japan, and Russia. In an apparent breakthrough, North Korea agreed to abandon its nuclear weapons and existing programs in September 2005, and pledged to return to the nonproliferation treaty and renew access to international weapons inspectors. In return, other parties to the talks would supply North Korea with energy aid and recognize its right to pursue a peaceful nuclear energy program. The United States and South Korea also agreed to refrain from deploying nuclear weapons on the Korean peninsula. The talks began to wobble over a disagreement about whether the United States had improperly frozen North Korean assets, and were further derailed when Pyongyang carried out its first nuclear test in October 2006. So had North Korea extracted concessions through those talks? Not so much, say experts. ""They didn’t really pocket any concessions in the process,"" Noland said, ""unless you regard stringing us along and buying time as a sort of concession."" The Six-Party talks would later resume under Bush. Not everyone agrees North Korea got the better end of the Bush-era negotiations — in fact, some say Pyongyang gave more than it received. ""The Bush era again saw some serious concessions made by the North Koreans, such as permitting American inspectors to reside permanently at its nuclear research center, in return, in my opinion, for very insignificant concessions from the U.S.,"" DeThomas said. Talks continued under the administration of President Barack Obama. On Feb. 29, 2012, the United States and Pyongyang announced a so-called ""Leap Day Agreement,"" under which North Korea would stop enriching uranium and missile testing, and would allow for the return of weapons inspectors. Here’s how senior Brookings Institution fellow Evans J.R. Revere described North Korea’s benefit: ""In return for freezing their nuclear and missile programs, they received expressions of U.S. non-hostility and willingness to promote cultural and educational exchanges, a U.S. statement that sanctions were not meant to hurt the North Korean people, and, in a separate but parallel negotiation, 240,000 metric tons of nutritional assistance that the Korean People’s Army is unlikely to find appetizing."" According to Revere, Pyongyang downplayed the significance of the Leap Day accord. Why? ""Probably because they had concluded they were getting little from the deal,"" he wrote. Furthermore, because North Korea effectively ended the agreement by announcing a satellite launch a short time later, it didn’t accrue the benefits it was promised, Noland said. ""It ended any enthusiasm in Washington for any further negotiations with them under the Obama presidency, but they did not really pocket any concessions,"" DeThomas said. ""They just killed an agreement in its cradle.""    Williams said North Korea's history of international negotiations shows ""they'll take the concessions, they'll keep them in their pocket and then they won't deliver."" Experts agreed with Williams’ broader point that skepticism is warranted when dealing with North Korea. In terms of North Korea pocketing sanctions, the Agreed Framework offers the strongest evidence. In that case, Pyongyang gained economic aid and other relief from the United States and others before things soured. Yet the other examples Williams cited offer a more mixed picture — both in terms of the balance of benefits and blame for the talks’ collapse. Some experts believe North Korea gave more than it received in some negotiations. We rate this Half True.",/factchecks/2018/jun/07/juan-williams/does-north-koreas-negotiating-history-mean-it-cant/

Ron DeSantis overplays link between the opioid crisis and southern border
","Republican candidate for Florida governor Ron DeSantis has a plan to solve the opioid epidemic, and it starts with securing the southern border of the United States. That’s where lethal drugs pour into the country, he said during the Westside Republican Club Reagan Day Barbecue in Callahan, Fla., on June 2. ""This drug crisis is driven by a lot of the drugs that are pouring across the southern border,"" DeSantis said. ""Yeah, there are problems with prescription medication and things like that, and Florida's done some stuff to rein that in. The bulk of the problem with the opioid epidemic is the fentanyl and all the synthetic drugs coming across the southern border. When you have a weak border like under (former President Barack) Obama — that's a wet kiss to the drug cartels. They love that, because they can move so much product into our country."" Here, we’ll fact-check his link between synthetic drugs smuggled across the U.S.-Mexico border and the American opioid crisis. What did a ""weak border"" have to do with it? DeSantis has a point about the rise of synthetic opioids. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, overdose deaths involving synthetic opioids surged from 2013 to 2016. Among the more than 64,000 drug overdose deaths estimated in 2016, the sharpest increase occurred among deaths related to fentanyl and synthetic opioids with almost 20,000 overdose deaths. The problem with DeSantis’ claim is linking the supply of fentanyl and synthetic drugs from the southern border to the opioid epidemic killing tens of thousands of Americans each year. These drugs can and do enter from across the southern border, but these drugs also tend to come in through other points of entry. The National Institute on Drug Abuse describes opioids as a class of drugs that includes heroin, fentanyl and prescription pain relievers such as oxycodone (including OxyContin), hydrocodone (including Vicodin), codeine, morphine and many others. Fentanyl, which DeSantis mentioned, is a powerful pain reliever that is similar to morphine but is 50 to 100 times more potent. Fentanyl can be prescribed to treat advanced cancer pain, but can be made and sold on the illegal drug market, often mixed with or sold as heroin. Other synthetic opioids include tramadol and fentanyl analogs, which are drugs designed to mimic the pharmacological effects of the original drug. More than 42,000 people died as a result of opioid-related overdoses in 2016, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. About 16,800 deaths involved a prescription opioid, and more than 19,000 were related to synthetic opioids (the latter category is what DeSantis is talking about). While synthetic drugs accounted for more deaths than prescription opioids, there’s no way to know how exactly how many of those drugs crossed the southern border before they were taken. International gangs based in Mexico ""remain the greatest criminal drug threat to the United States,"" and their most common method of smuggling drugs is vehicles legally coming into the U.S., according to a 2017 Drug Enforcement Administration report. But that’s for all drugs, not just synthetic drugs like DeSantis said. They type of drugs that DeSantis singled out tend to enter the country through other points of entry — including, but not limited to, the southern border. According to a 2017 DEA report, China is a main supplier of fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds. Some of the fentanyl comes straight to the United States from China through the mail. Other shipments come in from China to Mexico or China to Canada before making its way into the United States. In addition, fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds are also sold and distributed through illicit drug markets on the dark web, the report said. Between 2013 and 2017, Border Patrol seized 286 pounds of fentanyl, 3218 pounds of heroin, and 23 pounds of morphine, according to the Homeland Security & Governmental Affairs Committee from May 2018. We don’t have an exact breakdown of how much fentanyl reaches final users through Chinese labs and how much comes from across the border. That’s because China-sourced fentanyl concealed in mail parcels can be difficult for law enforcement officials to trace back to the original sender. Traffickers forward the package multiple times to different people, according to the DEA report. President Donald Trump’s opioid commission seemed more concerned with shipments from China than couriers from Mexico. ""We are miserably losing this fight to prevent fentanyl from entering our country and killing our citizens,"" the commission reported. ""We are losing this fight (predominantly) through China."" Trump’s opioid commission says many users order the pill form of fentanyl online and have it shipped discreetly. The commission’s report references a Carnegie Mellon University study that found revenues from online illicit drug sales increased from between $15 million and 17 million in 2012 to $150 million and $180 million in 2015. The fentanyl found at the southern border tends to be less potent than the fentanyl shipped through the mail. ""Large volumes of fentanyl are seized at the (southern border), although these seizures are typically low in purity — on average approximately 7 percent,"" the 2017 DEA report says. ""Conversely, the smaller volumes seized after arriving in the mail directly from China can have purities over 90 percent and be worth much more than the fentanyl seized at the (southwest border)."" To emphasize this point, DeSantis' spokesperson Brad Herold pointed to previous PolitiFact-checks that show that heroin is mainly smuggled through Mexico. That is accurate, though heroin is not a synthetic drug. ""As most experts admit, fentanyl is mixed with heroin and other drugs in Mexico and sent across the border,"" Herold said. Experts are skeptical that enhancing southern border security (like a wall) can do much to improve the opioid crisis. That’s because traffickers have a history of circumnavigating patrol measures, using catapults, drones, boats and tunnels. In other words, securing the border patrol might change where drugs are trafficked but it might not change the amount. David Herzberg, a professor who studies the history of American prescription drug abuse at the University at Buffalo, took issue with DeSantis’ characterization of what's driving the opioid epidemic. The crisis began with a dramatic uptick in new cases of addiction associated with a rise in the volume of prescribed opioids, and then illicit synthetic ones. The ""bulk of the problem,"" as experts see it now, has to do with the lack of resources for those already struggling with addiction, such as methadone and Naltrexone. ""In other words, ‘the problem’ now is not the smuggled opioid supply, it is our failure to deliver an adequate public health response to existing cases of opioid dependence and addiction,"" Herzberg said. DeSantis said, ""The bulk of the problem with the opioid epidemic is the fentanyl and all the synthetic drugs coming across the southern border."" This claim downplays the fact that synthetic drugs are smuggled into the country from locations outside of the southern border, especially from China. However, exact numbers to sort out how much comes from where were unavailable. Trump’s own commission seemed more concerned with China than Mexico when it comes to synthetic drugs.  We rate the statement Half True.",/factchecks/2018/jun/07/ron-desantis/ron-desantis-overplays-link-between-opioid-crisis-/

U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin's 'very cheesy ad' cuts the mustard
","Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin is in a bruising political battle that includes third-party groups pouring millions of dollars into the race. Baldwin will face the winner of the Republican matchup between Delafield businessman Kevin Nicholson and state Sen. Leah Vukmir, R-Wauwatosa. Baldwin started running TV ads in February, highlighting her work on ""Buy America"" legislation and prescription drug costs. In a follow-up ad, launched April 16, 2018, Baldwin turned to a quintessential Wisconsin issue … Yes, wooden cheese boards. The ad starts with the warning: ""This is gonna be a cheesy ad … a very cheesy ad."" Then it turns to Baldwin who says: ""When federal bureaucrats wanted to prohibit the use of wooden cheese boards, which help make tens of millions of pounds of cheese a year, something had to be done."" The ad then shifts to Thorp, Wis., cheesemaker Marieke Penterman, known for the Penterman farm’s ""Marieke Gouda"" cheese, who says: ""Tammy Baldwin stepped in, helped eliminate regulations and stood up for businesses like ours."" Is the claim in the Baldwin cheese ad gouda? Or is it, as critics claim, a little overripe? Baldwin’s evidence At the center of the ad is a 2014 cheese board brouhaha. It started after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration inspected several New York state cheesemakers and cited them for using wooden surfaces to age cheeses, stating the practice was unsanitary. That inspection and report caused alarm in the artisan cheesemaking community.   On her campaign website, under the headline ""Standing Up for a WI Way of Life,"" Baldwin describes it this way: In 2014, the FDA wanted to prohibit the use of wooden boards used for aging cheese, quintessential to some of our state’s best products. In fact, the Wisconsin Cheesemakers Association estimated in 2014 that 33 million pounds of cheese were aging on wooden boards in Wisconsin. Tammy took immediate action. She pressured the FDA and pointed out the ""serious ramifications for Wisconsin’s world-renown cheesemakers who have safely aged their cheeses on wooden boards for generations."" The FDA soon backed down on restricting use of wooden boards for aging. Critics say Baldwin’s bureaucracy-busting claim is overblown. The National Republican Senatorial Committee issued a news release that said, in part: ""In the new spot, Senator Baldwin goes on about her record ‘eliminating regulations’ and taking on ‘federal bureaucrats’ in the cheese industry. Get a grip. There’s never been an industry Senator Baldwin didn’t want to tax, regulate or burden with new legislation."" Conservative WISN talk show host Jay Weber dismissed Baldwin’s action as ""she wrote a letter,"" adding: ""More accurately, her staff did, and she signed it. Baldwin did literally the minimum she could. She didn't 'step in' anywhere."" To be sure, Baldwin’s claim is actually a minimalist one. Not that she was responsible for the change, only that she ""stepped in"" and ""helped eliminate the regulations."" 
What happened and what did Baldwin do? When we asked the Baldwin team for more specifics, a spokesman pointed us to a Baldwin website page featuring statements on various dairy industry issues. But it basically repeats the information included with the ad: And when the FDA tried to tell Wisconsin’s world-renowned cheesemakers to stop using traditional wood boards for aging, Tammy stepped in and told the regulators to back-off. Working hand-in-hand with Wisconsin’s dairy industry, Tammy successfully pressured the Washington regulators to reverse their decision. The Baldwin site also references several news articles about the issue, including a Wisconsin State Journal piece from June 12, 2014. The article notes that in a letter the day before to FDA Commissioner Margaret Hamburg, Baldwin sought clarification on the agency’s cheese board policy: I am writing in regards to disturbing reports that the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is pursuing policies to end the use of wooden boards in cheese aging. This has raised great concern among Wisconsin’s cheesemakers, who are currently aging 33 million pounds of cheese on these boards and whose businesses rely on this process. If these reports are true, the FDA should immediately cease any efforts to end the use of wooden boards in cheese aging. In addition, I am requesting that the FDA clarify its policy on cheese aging and enter into a transparent discussion about the role that wooden boards play in cheese processing and food safety.   At the time, the FDA released a statement clarifying its policy: Recently, you may have heard some concerns suggesting the FDA has taken steps to end the long-standing practice in the cheesemaking industry of using wooden boards to age cheese. To be clear, we have not and are not prohibiting or banning the long-standing practice of using wood shelving in artisanal cheese. Nor does the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) require any such action. Reports to the contrary are not accurate… At issue is a January 2014 communication from the agency’s Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition to the New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets’ Division of Milk Control and Dairy Services, which was sent in response to questions from New York State. The FDA recognizes that this communication has prompted concerns in the artisanal cheesemaking community.... In the interest of public health, the FDA's current regulations state that utensils and other surfaces that contact food must be ""adequately cleanable"" and ""properly maintained."" Historically, the FDA has expressed concern about whether wood meets this requirement and these concerns have been noted in its inspectional findings. However, the FDA will engage with the artisanal cheesemaking community, state officials and others to learn more about current practices and discuss the safety of aging certain types of cheeses on wooden shelving, as well as to invite stakeholders to share any data or evidence they have gathered related to safety and the use of wood surfaces. We welcome this open dialogue. In a June 10, 2014 article, the Associated Press noted that ""The FDA’s statement was issued in response to a letter written by Wisconsin Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection secretary Ben Brancel urging FDA officials to take a second look at its policy."" The article did include Baldwin’s on a list of Wisconsin officials who contacted the FDA on the issue, along with Gov. Scott Walker, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan (D-Madison) and state Sen. Dale Schultz (R-Richland Center). In addition to making phone calls and writing the letter to the FDA, Baldwin, along with U.S. Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont and others, introduced an amendment that aimed ""to require the commissioner of Food and Drugs to issue guidance before using funds to limit or prohibit the use of wood boards for cheese aging or ripening,"" a Baldwin staffer said. The larger legislation, and amendment, did not get a vote on the Senate floor. Finally, we turned to the FDA itself on whether its stance on wooden cheese boards has changed. The agency issued this statement: The FDA does not prohibit the practice of using wood shelving in cheesemaking. Over the past 4 years, the agency has engaged in extensive dialogue with the artisanal cheesemaking community on food safety practices after stakeholders, including Congress, asked for clarification on agency requirements. Among other things, the American Cheese Society (ACS) worked with the FDA to provide clarity to their members and food safety guidance on this topic, which can be found in the ACS Best Practices Guide for Cheesemakers. The FDA, ACS, state and local governments, among others, all share the same goal: to ensure that the cheese Americans enjoy is safe. Our rating In a TV ad, Baldwin said that ""when federal bureaucrats wanted to prohibit the use of wooden cheese boards, which help make tens of millions of pounds of cheese a year"" she ""stepped in, helped eliminate the regulations."" Baldwin’s actions in the cheese board dustup included phone calls, a letter to the FDA and the introduction of an amendment, all of which helped prompt a clarification of its cheese board policy. The FDA says the regulation dealing with sanitary practices was never eliminated, though the agency’s clarification of its policy did allow the cheesemaking to continue.

Dinesh D'Souza and Rosie O'Donnell FEC violations different
","Backlash to President Donald Trump’s pardon of Dinesh D’Souza caused complaints of a double standard among conservatives. In an interview with the Austin American-Statesman, Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, told the reporter that D’Souza faced political persecution for a crime liberal comedian Rosie O’Donnell had committed five-fold. (Cruz also claimed credit for the pardon and called D’Souza his friend.) ""What’s interesting is, just a few weeks ago we saw revelations that Rosie O’Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh was prosecuted for,"" Cruz said. ""I don’t recall any of those liberal activists on Twitter calling for Rose O’Donnell to be prosecuted."" Did O’Donnell commit the same offense as D’Souza? The two cases are very different. The Federal Election Commission caps donations to individual candidates at $2,700 per election. Primaries, runoffs and general elections are counted separately. On May 20, 2014, D’Souza was convicted of a felony for making illegal contributions to Wendy Long’s unsuccessful challenge of Kirsten Gillibrand to represent New York in the U.S. Senate. Long was a friend from D’Souza’s time at Dartmouth College. D’Souza was allowed to contribute a maximum of $5,000 to a single candidate. (The limit on each election was $2,500 in 2012 due to inflation, and this covered the primary and general election.) In March 2012, D’Souza gave $10,000 on behalf of himself and his wife. He then directed his assistant and a lover to also contribute $5,000 each on behalf of themselves and their spouses for a total of $20,000. D’Souza reimbursed them. D’Souza pleaded guilty ""to violating the federal campaign election law by making illegal contributions to a United States Senate campaign in the names of others,"" the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York said in a statement. He ""admitted that he knew that what he was doing was wrong and something the law forbids."" D’Souza faced eight months in a supervised community confinement center, five years of probation, and a $30,000 fine. Trump pardoned D’Souza on May 31. The New York Post reported that O’Donnell made the following contributions, exceeding the individual limit of $2,700 by a total of $5,400. $4,700 to Alabama Sen. Doug Jones in the special general election against Roy Moore. $3,600 to Pennsylvania Rep. Conor Lamb for the special election he won in March. $2,950 to California Rep. Adam Schiff for his primary congressional race. $4,200 to Lauren Underwood, an Illinois congressional candidate, for her primary. (Note: when we searched the FEC individual contributor database, we found $2,700 are marked as going towards the primary campaign and $1,500 towards the general.) $3,450 to Omar Vaid, a congressional candidate in Staten Island and Brooklyn, for his primary. O’Donnell told the New York Post she did not deliberately exceed the limit. ""If $2,700 is the cut off — (candidates) should refund the money,"" she said. ""I don’t look to see who I can donate most to … I just donate assuming they do not accept what is over the limit."" O’Donnell indeed broke FEC rules, but campaign finance experts told us this type of violation goes unpunished as long as there is no intent to deceive. The money can be refunded or redirected to the candidate’s next race. ""The rather small amounts in excess of the limits, as well as the fact that O’Donnell made no effort to conceal the contributions, indicates this is just a sloppy mistake,"" said Craig Holman, a government affairs lobbyist at the left-leaning watchdog group Public Citizen. ""Rosie O'Donnell contributed her own money in her own name to the candidates in question,"" said Michael Malbin, executive director at the Campaign Finance Institute. ""The candidates are in fact responsible for keeping records and returning the extra, although she should also know what she is doing, as most donors do. Her contributions were fully disclosed."" In an op-ed calling out a double standard, D’Souza said he did not buy O’Donnell’s defense. ""I find this defense implausible because O’Donnell used four different – though similar –variations of her name and five different addresses,"" D’Souza wrote. The variations in her name were as follows: Rose Odonnell, Rose O’Donnell, Rosie O’Donnell, and Rosie Odonnell. She listed two different zip codes (which correspond with homes she owns) in two of the donations that exceeded the limit. Experts said D’Souza’s case was distinct by legal standards. D’Souza violated statutes 52 U.S.C. 30116 for exceeding contribution limits, 52 U.S.C. 30122 for making contributions in the name of another, and 18 U.S.C. 1001 for lying to law enforcement. The last (and most serious) charge was eventually dropped in the plea bargain. O’Donnell violated only the first statute. But criminal enforcement is only deemed appropriate if the violation is knowing and willful. Violators are usually subject to a civil penalty instead. The FEC has not announced an investigation of O’Donnell, although Holman said they ""likely deemed that violation as unintentional and just not worth their time."" Cruz said, ""Rosie O’Donnell apparently committed the same offense five times, five times, when she broke the identical law that Dinesh was prosecuted for."" Both D’Souza and O’Donnell violated campaign contribution limits, which is a criminal offense. Those cases are subject to prosecution if determined to be willful. D’Souza’s violation was considered willful. He violated another law by using straw donors to donate $20,000 over the legal limit to one Senate candidate. O’Donnell surpassed the limit by a quarter of that money in donating to five different campaigns under her own name.

Is U.S. wine barred from Canadian supermarkets?
","As tensions rose between two longtime allies over trade, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., took aim at Canadian wine. McCarthy’s interview with CNN’s State of the Union aired as the United States was slapping tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum. Canada retaliated with a series of tariffs on U.S. consumer products. ""I think what we're finding here is, we are in the middle of a trade discussion,"" McCarthy said in the June 3 interview. ""Nobody wants to be in a trade war. Nobody wins a trade war. But we are standing up for the process of where we're moving forward that we have fair trade. If you are talking about Canada, look what they do when it comes to our dairy products. Look what it — our wine cannot sit on their supermarkets."" Does Canada really bar U.S. wine from its supermarkets? Short answer: The whole country doesn’t, but the United States is challenging a rule in one province, British Columbia, at the World Trade Organization. McCarthy’s office pointed us to a province-level policy enacted by British Columbia in 2015 that limits sales of wine in grocery stores to products made in British Columbia. The U.S. began challenging this provision under President Barack Obama. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, only British Columbia wine may be sold on grocery store shelves. The only way supermarkets can sell imported wine is in a physically separated area with its own cash registers. British Columbia’s rules ""discriminate against U.S. and other imported wine by allowing only B.C. wine to be sold on regular grocery store shelves,"" the U.S. Trade Representative said in announcing its action. ""Such discriminatory measures limit sales opportunities for U.S. wine producers and provide a substantial competitive advantage for BC wine."" Other countries that have complained about the rule include Argentina, Chile, Mexico, New Zealand and the European Union, according to the Toronto Globe and Mail. Discriminatory rules also prevail in Ontario and Quebec, according to the Wine Institute, a U.S. trade association. So McCarthy is referring to a real phenomenon, though one limited to a province. When we checked in with experts on U.S.-Canada trade, they added some additional context. First, even with the restrictions, the U.S. wine industry leads foreign wine sales in Canada. About 69 percent of Canadian wine sales in 2017 were imports. The United States ranks first among all nations for imported wine sales in Canada, totaling 504 million Canadian dollars in 2016, or roughly $388 million at American exchange rates. The United States accounted for 21 percent of all imported wine sales in Canada that year. And according to the Wine Institute, the United States sells more wine to Canada than to any country other than the European Union. That’s no small feat, said Ross Burkhart, a political scientist specializing in U.S.-Canada relations at Boise State University. ""The U.S. exports almost as much wine to Canada as to the E.U., with about a tenth of the population in Canada compared to that of the E.U.,"" Burkhart said. Second, experts said that government-run liquor stores are probably the predominant source for wine sales, especially for foreign wines that are not discriminated against in such outlets. ""U.S. wines sell widely in Canada through the government controlled liquor stores,"" said Munroe Eagles, director of Canadian studies at the State University of New York-Buffalo. The offerings at such stores as ""larger and more comprehensive."" Dan Trefler, who teaches at the University of Toronto’s Rotman School of Management, noted that in his province, Ontario, there are 8,553 supermarkets, but only 70 currently sell wine. That’s less than 1 percent. In fact, Trefler said, ""grocery store wines are typically the cheapest wines and are bought by people who would not likely pay extra for high-quality U.S. wines. If Ontario opened up grocery stores to U.S. wines, it would have virtually no impact on U.S. exports to Canada."" As it happens, the ability of U.S. wines to compete aggressively in Canada was made possible by the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, the precursor to the North American Free Trade Agreement. Prior to the agreement, ""government wine stores marked up U.S. wine by 50 percentage points more than Canadian wine,"" Trefler said. ""This was a massive trade restriction. The FTA eliminated that restriction."" If NAFTA was terminated, he added, ""Canada could consider reinstating the 50 percentage point differential. McCarthy has chosen to emphasize a minor irritant when he could instead emphasize the great job NAFTA has done in knocking down Canadian barriers to U.S. wines. Ending NAFTA will likely hurt U.S. wine producers."" McCarthy said, ""If you are talking about Canada .. our wine cannot sit on their supermarkets."" He’s referring to an official U.S. government complaint about a provincial rule affecting how wine is sold in British Columbia supermarkets. However, that rule is not in force across Canada, and it’s worth noting that the United States sells a whole lot of wine in Canada despite the rule, including in government-run stores that do not discriminate against imports.

Can state force Foxconn to install solar panels for public use?
","Saying Wisconsin made a ""bad deal"" to bring Foxconn to the state, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tony Evers argues Wisconsin should force the company to be the best corporate citizens in the state. He suggested the state put Foxconn’s ""feet to the fire"" to make the company provide high wages and benefits, as well as transportation for workers who do not live close to the Racine County plant. Then Evers took it one step further. ""We could compel Foxconn to put solar panels on the roof, and there'd be enough electricity generated to serve 33,000 homes in southeast Wisconsin,"" Evers said in an April 22, 2018, interview on UpFront with Mike Gousha on WISN-TV (Channel 12). Evers said he thinks Foxconn — which has begun work on a $10 billion facility that is to employ up to 13,000 in Racine County — is ""all in,"" so renegotiating shouldn’t jeopardize the deal. Can the state force such an action at this point? And, if it forced the solar panels, could the panels really power more than 30,000 homes? Let’s take a look. Asked to back up the claim, Evers spokeswoman Maggie Gau said he was drawing from a Wisconsin State Journal column from August 2017. In the piece, John Imes, executive director for the Madison-based Wisconsin Environmental Initiative, presented the idea as a hypothetical. ""Imagine if … all of the roofs on those facilities were covered with the latest solar panel technology?"" Imes wrote. ""The buildings would generate over 200 (megawatt-hours) of electricity each year, enough to power almost 33,000 homes."" But experts say a solar system with the kind of capacity Evers describes would have to be several hundred megawatts -- unprecedented for a rooftop solar array. A handful of U.S. solar farms — in places like Arizona and California — have this capacity, but those are dedicated, ground-based units. PV Magazine, a solar industry publication, says the largest rooftop system now is less than 20 megawatts, though Tesla has begun work on one around 70 megawatts. Such a system at Foxconn could cost $250 million to $500 million, said David Feldman, an economic and financial analysis researcher with the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. Experts disagree on whether a system that size would be enough to power 33,000 homes. The planned Foxconn campus will cover about 22 million square feet, though a company spokesman declined to specify how much roof square footage will be involved (multi-story buildings would obviously reduce the available roof space). Two of the three solar experts we talked with said a roof around that size could feasibly provide enough power. Cara Marcy, renewable electricity analyst with the U.S. Energy Information Administration, said a roof at 22 million square feet -- based on the typical sunshine in Mount Pleasant -- could generate about 430,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually. That’s above the roughly 300,000 megawatt-hours that 33,000 homes would need, based on the typical energy usage in Wisconsin. Ben Zientara, lead researcher and policy analyst for Solar Power Rocks, said a solar array could be enough to power 33,000 homes at 13 million square feet, well below the size of Foxconn. However, that would require flat-mounted arrays, which would be more susceptible to snow buildup. But calculations by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission, which regulates public utilities in the state, showed solar panels on 22 million square feet of roof would only generate enough electricity for about 24,000 homes, said spokesman Matthew Spencer. All calculations required some assumptions or approximations based on the type of solar panels — fixed or movable on one or two axes to tilt with the sun — and the space between panels. Experts also noted not all of the roof space would be usable for solar panels. The size of such a project means it is much more than a math problem, however. Marcy said it’s not realistic to describe generators in terms of homes powered because solar power is so inconsistent. It is obviously not available at night, or for long stretches of winter. ""The solar facilities are not necessarily generating electricity at the same time electricity is needed by the system consumer, so from that perspective I think it’s inaccurate to say it's meeting the electricity of these homes,"" she said. A typical solar array has a maximum capacity around 20%, meaning there is enough sunshine to generate electricity about one-fifth of the time, experts say. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory’s solar resource calculator assumes 16%, but Wisconsin would face a challenge typical high-use solar states would not — snow removal. Spencer, whose agency is run by three commissioners appointed by Gov. Scott Walker, said companies that install solar arrays typically use the electricity for themselves first, then sell any unused power back to the grid. Spencer said it is likely not legal for Foxconn to provide electricity directly to the public — as the claim suggests  — without going through the agency to become certified as a public utility. This brings us to where Evers’ claim started – whether Wisconsin ""could compel"" Foxconn to build such a thing. Requirements like installing solar panels could be fair game as part of negotiating an incentive package for a company like Foxconn. But for Foxconn, those negotiations are already over. ""Any discussions about what could have been included in that contract are hypothetical and moot at this point since the state already has an executed contract in place,"" said Mark Maley, spokesman for the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. The agency is run by a 12-member board of Republican appointees, though it includes two Democratic party representatives. Maley said contracts do change in some cases, such as if the agreed-upon number of new jobs changes. That would open up a new negotiating window where changes to the agreement itself could theoretically happen. Jack Huddleston, emeritus professor of urban and regional planning at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said trying to re-open negotiations now would be ""pretty risky"" for the state. ""The Development Agreement (DA) that was agreed to by all involved parties was a result of trade-offs made by each party,"" he said in an email. ""If Foxconn, for example, agrees to renegotiate, it may demand new requirements to compensate for the loss of previously agreed to components."" Gau, the Evers spokeswoman, noted Foxconn has made investments in renewable power in other countries. ""If they are doing this there, why not here?"" she said in an email. ""Companies can be compelled to follow certain hiring practices like wages and employing workers from certain geographic areas, why not renewable energy for on-site sustainability or surrounding homes?"" Evers says the state ""could compel"" Foxconn to install solar panels, and those would have enough capacity to power 33,000 homes. Experts say the quoted capacity is theoretically possible, though it would be extremely expensive and vastly larger than anything put on a roof in the world to date. And the logistical issues are many. Meanwhile, Foxconn construction is underway and incentive agreements have been signed, so the state doesn’t appear to have a route to force such action unless outside factors lead to reopened negotiations.

Bill Clinton overplays debt following Monica Lewinsky affair
","Asked about his past in the context of the #MeToo movement, former President Bill Clinton said he did the right thing in the aftermath of the Monica Lewinsky scandal, and claimed he didn’t go unpunished thanks to the red ink that followed. ""I felt terrible then, and I came to grips with it,"" Clinton said during an NBC News interview. ""Did you ever apologize to her?"" Craig Melvin asked. ""Yes,"" Clinton said, following some hesitation. ""And nobody believes that I got out of that for free. I left the White House $16 million in debt. But you typically have ignored gaping facts in describing this, and I bet you don’t even know this. This was litigated 20 years ago."" But Clinton didn’t have his own facts straight. Later in the interview, Clinton admitted he never talked to Lewinsky in the aftermath of the affair. He only apologized publicly, and to a long list of people involved. As for his claim about leaving the White House with $16 million in debt, that’s an exaggeration. We previously looked at a claim by Hillary Clinton that she and Bill came out of the White House ""dead broke."" A closer look at Clinton’s 2001 financial disclosure form for the Senate shows they possibly had more liabilities than assets, but it doesn’t show that conclusively. Bill Clinton’s claim is different, however. He did not clarify whether he was talking about net or gross debt, or how exactly those debts came to be. He did suggest that the legal fees played an important role. So we took another look at Hillary Clinton’s 2001 Senate financial disclosure form, which gives us a public look into hers and her husband’s finances. Hillary Clinton reported that legal debt for the Clintons and former staff members came to a minimum of $1.75 million and maximum of $6.5 million. Bill Clinton’s spokesman, Angel Ureña, pointed us to a Washington Post report from 2007 that said the Clintons ""left the White House with an estimated $12 million in legal debts rung up during the Whitewater, campaign fundraising and Monica S. Lewinsky investigations."" Several news reports echoed a similar estimate of legal costs, but we were unable to track down the source of that amount. The burden of legal costs didn’t entirely fall on the Clintons. Established in 1998, the Presidential Legal Expense Trust defrayed personal legal expenses through donations from U.S. citizens (government employees or registered lobbyists were not allowed). That was the second trust set up to pay off the Clintons’ legal expenses. In July 2001, The New Yorker reported the fund raised $8.8 million. ""Even after expenses, that covered much of the eleven or twelve million dollars in legal fees that the Clintons have incurred so far,"" the report reads. (Clinton left the White House in January 2001.) That legal debt was gone by 2004, according to Hillary Clinton’s financial disclosure form. Jeff Hoopes, an accounting professor at University of North Carolina, told us there were numbers that may not have made it into the disclosure form, such as mortgages or loans from relatives. Mortgages could realistically have added a burden. In 1999, the Clintons bought a five-bedroom home in Chappaqua, N.Y., for $1.7 million. In December 2000, just as they were leaving the White House, they bought a seven-bedroom house near Embassy Row in Washington for $2.85 million. Citibank lent the Clintons $1.995 million to buy the Washington house. Hoopes emphasized that whatever the value of debt, the Clintons were unambiguously not suffering financially after leaving office. ""They had a huge amount of earnings potential, and to keep suggesting they were suffering financially is disingenuous,"" Hoopes said. Hoopes’ point: The Clintons may have taken on debt but had a clear path to getting out of the red. And they sure did. Forbes, using Hillary Clinton’s tax returns, estimated the Clintons earned more than $240 million from 2001-15. Clinton said he ""left the White House $16 million in debt."" Hillary Clinton’s 2000 Senate financial disclosure form shows a debt of anywhere between $1.75 million and maximum of $6.5 million. Bill Clinton’s spokesman said the Clintons’ legal fees reached $12 million, but a large portion of that was covered by a legal defense fund.

Website misquotes former Starbucks chairman Howard Schultz about views on marriage
","With his decision to step down as executive chairman of Starbucks, Howard Schultz has been in the news a lot lately, and one resurfacing headline would have readers believe he once told opponents of same-sex marriage that he did not want their business. But this is an uncorroborated quote that has been floating around the internet for years. ""Starbucks CEO: ‘If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don’t Want Your Business,"" said a February 2017 headline from My Christian Daily, which circulated social media last week. My Christian Daily is a project from Initiate Media, a Christian media company that ""seek(s) to make God famous,"" according to its ""About"" page. Similar stories have appeared on various websites since 2013. My Christian Daily cited an article from the Washington Press — a website that we were unable to find and may no longer exist — as well as an article from Forbes. Facebook users flagged this story as part of efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story about Schultz said that during a 2013 annual meeting for Starbucks shareholders, Schultz received a complaint from Tom Strobhar, founder of The Corporate Morality Action Center, an organization with a mission to ""challenge companies that offend traditional moral norms"" such as ""the sacredness of marriage between a man and a woman."" Strobhar said he believed Starbucks lost revenue because of its public support for a 2012 same-sex marriage referendum, which in turn inspired boycotts from anti-gay-marriage groups, such as the National Organization for Marriage. The referendum asked voters if same-sex marriage should be legalized in the state of Washington, and Starbucks joined other leading Washington-area companies in supporting the measure. In response, the story went, Schultz told Strobhar to sell his Starbucks shares and invest in other companies. As it turns out, Schultz’s actual remarks were more nuanced, and we did not find any credible articles that quoted him saying he did not want business from opponents of same-sex marriage. Snopes debunked this falsehood years ago and updated its post on Sunday. Schultz said at the time that the decision to support same-sex marriage was about respecting diversity rather than maximizing revenue. ""Not every decision is an economic decision,"" Schultz said. ""Despite the fact that you recite statistics that are narrow in time, we did provide a 38 percent shareholder return over the last year. I don’t know how many things you invest in, but I would suspect not many things, companies, products, investments have returned 38 percent over the last 12 months."" He continued: ""Having said that, it is not an economic decision to me. The lens in which we are making that decision is through the lens of our people. We employ over 200,000 people in this company, and we want to embrace diversity of all kinds. If you feel, respectfully, that you can get a higher return than the 38 percent you got last year, it’s a free country. You can sell your shares in Starbucks and buy shares in another company."" Schultz’s 38 percent figure comes from fiscal year 2012, meaning the timeframe between October 2011 to September 2012. This return was down from the previous fiscal year, which saw a 46 percent shareholder return. (See a video of Schultz’s full response.) When the U.S. Supreme Court legalized same-sex marriage nationwide in 2015, Starbucks issued a statement applauding the decision and recalling Schultz’s exchange with Strobhar as ""the company’s most vocal statement on diversity and equality."" Reggie Borges, a spokesperson for Starbucks, said the My Christian Daily story is not accurate and pointed to the Snopes fact-check, a video of Schultz’s response and the statement released after 2015 Supreme Court ruling as evidence. My Christian Daily did not respond to a request for comment. A headline stated, ""Starbucks CEO: ‘If You Support Traditional Marriage We Don’t Want Your Business.’"" This is a claim that has circulated since 2013. At an annual meeting for company shareholders, Strobhar said the company’s support for same-sex marriage was eroding its bottom line, which prompted Schultz to defend his decision. Schultz said Strobhar was free to sell his Starbucks stocks and invest in another company if he believed the company’s social policies meant he could get a better return on his money elsewhere.

President Trump said Eagles players kneeled for the anthem. They didn’t.
","It was the eve of June 5 — the night before the Eagles were supposed to visit the White House — when President Donald Trump announced an abrupt change of plans. The President released a statement Monday night informing the public that he had uninvited the Birds from the traditional post-Super Bowl victory visit. Why? In part because ""only a small number of players decided to come,"" and in part because Trump said that players had been kneeling or standing in the locker room during the national anthem, which he said was ""disrespectful."" Many people on the internet made the reasonable assumption that Trump was talking about Eagles players. But here’s the thing: none of the Eagles kneeled during the national anthem in 2017. According to a study released by Sports Pundit, the Birds were one of just seven teams in the NFL with a perfect non-kneeling record for the entire year. And they didn’t wait in the locker room either, per ESPN SportsCenter anchor Kevin Negandhi. We found no reports that said players stayed in the locker room. The only on-field activism displayed by some Eagles players was the raising of their fists during the national anthem, which was kickstarted by safety Malcolm Jenkins. There’s one tiny exception: cornerback Ron Brooks kneeled once, but he was cut before the season started. The movement among NFL players to kneel during the national anthem began back in 2016, when San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick took a knee during the 2016 preseason to protest police brutality and racial inequality. And other players followed suit. A record number of players kneeled during Week 3 of the 2017 season, after President Donald Trump stated that players who did so should be fired. Last month, NFL owners unanimously approved a new policy that would require players to stand if they are on the field during the national anthem, and slap teams with a fine if they disobey. Under the new rule, players would still be able to wait in the locker room during the anthem. In its reporting on Monday night, Fox News circulated images of a handful of Eagles kneelingbefore games, implying they did so in protest. Players jumped to defend themselves, saying the photos of them kneeling were actually moments of prayer, not protest. Executive Producer Chris Wallace later apologized for the ""misleading"" footage. The Eagles released their own statement — basically a subtweet of the President that didn’t acknowledge the issues at all. Pennsylvania politicians have since jumped in on the action. Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney called Trump a ""fragile egomaniac obsessed with crowd size and afraid of the embarrassment of throwing a party to which no one will attend."" Yeesh. So that’s what happens when you insult Kenney’s hometown team. Senator Bob Casey said he still supports the Birds, and he invited players to celebrate at the state Capitol. U.S. Rep. Brendan Boyle echoed that sentiment, welcoming the team to Harrisburg for Wawa coffee (on him). Our Ruling Trump said he canceled the Eagles’ visit to the White House in part because some players declined to attend, and in part because ""staying in the Locker Room for the playing of our National Anthem is as disrespectful to our country as kneeling.""

Tennessee Democrats slam Blackburn on military pay vote, overlook her track record of support
","When President Donald Trump went to Nashville to boost the Senate chances of Rep. Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., he praised her for being a reliable soldier for the Republican agenda. ""We need Marsha in the Senate to continue the amazing progress and work that we've done over the last year and a half,"" Trump said. But on one key vote, Blackburn broke with many of her Republican colleagues, and the Tennessee Democrats are chiding her for it. Blackburn was one of 90 Republicans to vote against a sweeping $1.3 trillion appropriations bill that funded agencies across the government. Inside its many pages was a 2.4 percent pay hike for the military. In an email to the media May 30, party spokesman Mark Brown had the subject line ""Blackburn voted against military pay raise."" The rest of the email was a copy and paste of an op-ed in the Tennessean from an Army veteran who criticized Blackburn for her vote. ""This is a congresswoman that constantly touts her support for the military and veterans, so her vote against something that would improve our quality of life is both puzzling and troubling,"" the veteran wrote. We decided to give Blackburn’s voting record a closer look. Blackburn made no secret that she opposed the spending bill. At the time of the vote, she released a statement decrying its impact on deficits. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the appropriations bill would put the country deeper in debt by many billions of dollars. ""Marsha has a record of supporting our military and veterans,"" campaign spokeswoman Abbi Sigler told us. ""Congressman Blackburn voted against the bloated spending package — that included a smaller military pay raise than the one she supported (2.6 percent) — because of its reckless spending."" As with any all-encompassing legislation, lawmakers will find some elements they support and others they oppose. Whichever way they vote, it is difficult to tie their decision to a specific section. In her 15 years in Congress, Blackburn has voted for appropriations bills that increased military pay at least four times, in 2004, 2005, 2007 and 2010. The military pay hikes in those appropriations bills ranged from 2.2 percent to 3.5 percent. There are a number of authorization bills with pay increases that Blackburn has also supported. We counted 14 over the years, including the most recent one that passed in November 2017 with a 2.4 percent pay hike. Authorization bills don’t carry the same weight as appropriations measures, because they don’t actually give agencies the green light to spend money. Despite her opposition to the latest spending bill, Blackburn welcomed Trump’s support, and several of the victories he described at the rally, such as hikes in military spending, came out of the appropriations bill she voted against. And when the chairwoman of the Republican National Committee Ronna McDaniel took to Twitter to praise Trump for the military pay raises, Blackburn’s campaign retweeted the message. The Tennessee Democratic Party said that Blackburn voted against a military pay increase. Blackburn did vote no on a $1.3 trillion appropriations bill that increased pay for members of the armed forces by 2.4 percent. However, over many years, Blackburn has a consistent track record of voting in favor of pay raises for the military. To tie her recent vote to a single part of a massive spending measure leaves out a great deal of context. In this case, the legislation was estimated to add billions to annual deficits.

Wayne LaPierre says Obama ignores border fence law
","In a searing call to action that appeared in the conservative Daily Caller, the NRA’s Wayne LaPierre encouraged Americans to arm themselves, join the NRA and recruit others in preparation against the growing threats of terrorism, economic instability and the policies of the Obama administration.

""It has always been sensible for good citizens to own and carry firearms for lawful protection against violent criminals who prey on decent people,"" LaPierre wrote. ""During the second Obama term, however, additional threats are growing.""

He cited drug gangs and other criminals who enter the United States through the southern border. They get in, LaPierre said, because ""the president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border.""

Flagrant defiance? We decided to examine whether it’s true that President Barack Obama is bucking a law requiring construction of a such a fence.

Secure Fence Act of 2006

We did not hear back from the NRA for this story. But the 2006 law directing fence construction is the Secure Fence Act of 2006, which was passed by a Republican-led Congress and signed by President George W. Bush. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of additional fencing along the border with Mexico. The act specified ""at least two layers of reinforced fencing.""

One thing it did not do: require a fence to be built ""along the entire Mexican border,"" as LaPierre claimed. Instead, it directed that specific segments of the border -- ""extending from 10 miles west of the Tecate, California, port of entry to 10 miles east of the Tecate, California, port of entry,"" for example -- be double-fenced. The fenced segments totaled roughly 650-700 miles, while the entire U.S.-Mexican border is about 2,000 miles long.

Obama, an Illinois senator at the time, voted for the law.

The following year, the legislation underwent a significant change. Officials at the Department of Homeland Security argued that different border terrains required different types of fencing -- that a one-size-fits-all approach across the entire border didn't make sense.

Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison, R-Texas, proposed an amendment to give DHS the discretion to decide what type of fence was appropriate in different areas. The law was amended to read, ""nothing in this paragraph shall require the Secretary of Homeland Security to install fencing, physical barriers, roads, lighting, cameras, and sensors in a particular location along an international border of the United States, if the Secretary determines that the use or placement of such resources is not the most appropriate means to achieve and maintain operational control over the international border at such location.""
   
In other words, Border Patrol would use its discretion to decide which type of fencing was appropriate in various regions. The amendment was included in a federal budget bill in late 2007.

Hutchison said at the time, ""Border patrol agents reported that coyotes and drug-runners were altering their routes as fencing was deployed, so the amendment gives our agents discretion to locate the fence where necessary to achieve operational control of our border."" Opponents, however, said the amendment effectively killed the border fence promised in the 2006 bill.

Today, DHS says Border Patrol has completed 651 miles of fencing, including 299 miles of vehicle fence and 352 miles of primary pedestrian fence. One mile of pedestrian fence is left to complete, and it is tied up in litigation.

So what’s being flagrantly defied?

That comes down to the difference between vehicle fence and pedestrian fence, as well as the ""double layer"" specification in the 2006 law.

On the one hand, the fence is virtually complete and in compliance with the 2007 amendment.

""It cost almost $3 million per mile to construct that fence. Including maintenance, it is supposed to cost over $6 billion over the next 20 years. President Obama is going above and beyond any president ever at enforcing our immigration laws,"" said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute.

On the other, it’s not the fence envisioned in 2006. For one thing, vehicle fencing would be more accurately described as posts placed close enough together that cars can’t be driven between them.

What’s more, just 36.3 miles of fencing are double-layered.

Said Rosemary Jenks with Numbers USA, a Washington group that favors low levels of immigration: ""The Secure Fence Act called for 650 miles of double-layer pedestrian fencing. While the administration claims to have completed 650 miles of fencing, virtually none of it is double layer, and several hundred miles is vehicle barriers, instead of fence at all.""

Other resources, practical considerations

While LaPierre was specific about fence construction, we thought we’d mention other aspects of border control.

Rey Koslowski, in a 2011 paper for the Migration Policy Institute, noted that the Southwest Border Security Act Obama signed in 2010 appropriated $600 million for enhanced border protection on top of the president’s July 2010 authorization to deploy 1,200 National Guard troops to the border. The largest share of the additional funding, $244 million, was to hire and maintain existing levels of Border Patrol agents and customs officers. Almost $200 million went to the Department of Justice to hire more federal law enforcement officers for the southwest border region, and still millions more went to communications and aerial surveillance equipment.

In an interview, Koslowski pointed out that the 2006 law required that no more than 18 months after its enactment the government should have ""operational control"" of the border. How was that defined? ""The prevention of all unlawful entries into the United States.""

""Well, guess what, they failed,"" Koslowski said. ""Under this definition, no country, not even East Germany, managed operational control like this.""

So the fence -- pedestrian and vehicle -- is an adaptation to changing immigration patterns, from population centers where people used to walk in, out to deserts and mountains where they drive across.

Added Gordon Hanson, an economist at University of California, San Diego: ""It simply doesn’t make economic sense to build a fence along the entire border; in desert/mountain regions there are far more efficient ways to block entry than a fence in the middle of nowhere.""

Our ruling

LaPierre wrote that ""the president flagrantly defies the 2006 federal law ordering the construction of a secure border fence along the entire Mexican border.""

First, he misrepresented what the law required, which was segments of fencing in specific places, not a continuous fence along the 2,000 mile border. Second, he ignored the 2007 amendment which gave the government some discretion over how to build the fence.

The fence that has been built -- just one mile short of what’s required -- is a combination of pedestrian fencing and vehicle barriers. To some critics that does not satisfy what Congress intended in 2006, and very little of it is double-layered. On that point, we think LaPierre’s statement contains a grain of truth.

Otherwise, though, it’s clear that Obama is not flagrantly defying the law, especially as resources toward other aspects of border enforcement are increasing.

"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'David Plouffe']","
David Plouffe says Latinos supported health care law the ""most""
","
A grande problemo for the Republican Party is how to win over Hispanic voters who flocked to President Barack Obama in 2012. But even with Republicans like Sen. Marco Rubio supporting immigration reform, Latinos are still concerned about other issues, said David Plouffe, a recently departed White House senior adviser.

For a New York Times magazine cover story about the Republican Party’s future, Plouffe was asked if a presidential candidate like Rubio could get his party back into the game.

Plouffe called Rubio ""the tea party Cuban-American from Florida"" and said he wouldn’t have much appeal to Hispanic voters in other states.

""And by the way: the bigger problem they’ve got with Latinos isn’t immigration,"" Plouffe said in the February article. ""It’s their economic policies and health care. The group that supported the president’s health care bill the most? Latinos.""

His statement that Latinos supported Obama’s Affordable Care Act more than other groups caught our attention, so we decided to check it out.

Polls about the Affordable Care Act

We reviewed several polls about the Affordable Care Act and generally found Latinos were supportive of the law. Two of the polls we examined showed blacks with the highest support, followed (sometimes closely) by Hispanics, while whites supported the law much less. Some polling experts told us, though, that the statistical differences between black and Hispanic support were not always significant.

We focused most of our search between March 2010 when the law was signed and the November 2012 election.

Here are a few examples:

• Polls of only Latinos:  We were unable to reach Plouffe, who has since left the White House, directly. But a spokesman at the White House sent us links to two polls. A Fox News Latino poll in September 2012 found 62 percent of likely Latino voters supported the Affordable Care Act. A poll by Latino Decisions shortly before the election found 61 percent of Latinos felt the law should be allowed to stand.

• Kaiser Family Foundation: This poll has repeatedly asked respondents if they had a generally favorable or unfavorable view of the law. In November 2012, it showed that among blacks 68 percent had a favorable view, while 52 percent of Hispanics favored it. But Hispanic notched 1 percent higher than blacks on their favorable view in April 2010, just after the Act was signed into law -- 68 to 67 percent. The favorability view of whites has fluctuated much less: 39 percent in April 2010 and 35 percent in November 2012.

Mollyann Brodie, a Kaiser senior vice president, told PolitiFact in an email: ""While in a couple of months the gaps you see are ‘statistically different,’ for the most part there is NO statistical difference between black and Hispanic support. So I think it would be wrong to suggest that in general blacks are more supportive than Hispanics, and the more accurate way to talk about our data is that blacks and Hispanics are more favorable towards the Affordable Care Act than white non-Hispanics.""

• Quinnipiac: In May 2010 a Quinnipiac poll asked ""Do you approve or disapprove of the federal health care overhaul?"" It found that 68 percent of blacks approved of the law while 52 percent of Hispanics did. Polls in 2012 showed that blacks favored letting the health care law stand more than Hispanics -- in February 68 to 42 percent and in July 73 to 52 percent.

Harvard School of Public Health professor Robert Blendon, who reviewed the Quinnipiac results, said the July 2012 survey had a large sample. ""Hispanics in that question are statistically different from blacks. They are lower in their level of support,"" he said. ""That survey had a very large sample. In the others, you can say that the bill was not more significantly popular among Hispanics than for blacks.""

Interpreting the polls

Opinions about the health care law tended to polarize along partisan lines.

""The No. 1 characteristic that has defined opinion on law since the day it passed is political party affiliation,"" said Brodie, the polling expert with the Kaiser Family Foundation. ""Democrats always disproportionately like it and Republicans always disproportionately hate it by huge percentages. African-Americans and Latinos are much more likely to be Democrats, and Democrats like this idea.""

Gabe Sanchez, a University of New Mexico political science professor who works for Latino Decisions, said Latinos and blacks have supported the law more than whites due to higher national average rates of being uninsured and knowing more people who lack insurance. Hispanics have the highest uninsured rates of any racial or ethnic group within the U.S., according to the federal Office of Minority Health.

Blendon said results from Quinnipiac show that Hispanics supported the law more than whites, but not as much as blacks. He said a possible reason could be the requirement that all people have health insurance, called the individual mandate. ""Hispanics have more self-employed and small businesses in their communities and this concern about the mandate’s impact economically for them may be a reason here,"" he said.

Jennifer Ng'andu, an expert on health and civil rights policy at the National Council of La Raza, which supported the final law, told PolitiFact in an email that ""In general, every poll that I’ve seen both during and following the passage of the Affordable Care Act confirms that black support for the Affordable Care Act was higher than Latinos."" But Hispanics showed strong support for health care reform nn general.

Our ruling

When Plouffe was talking about Obama’s support among Latinos he said, ""The group that supported the president’s health care bill the most? Latinos.""

The White House pointed to polls of Latino voters showing the majority supported the health care law, but that lacked a comparison to other groups.

Overall, the polls we looked at showed strong support for the health care law from Hispanics. However, we found little to suggest Hispanics supported the law ""the most."" Support for the law among blacks was very high and in some cases outpaced Hispanic support.  Experts we spoke with said that blacks supported the health care law the most or that they were fairly equal in support with Hispanics. Support for the law tended to follow partisan lines.

"['Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Medicaid', 'Medicare', 'Wisconsin', 'Ron Johnson']","
Ron Johnson says Republican budget proposals don’t cut spending, just reduce budget growth
","
Making the rounds reacting to President Barack Obama’s State of the Union speech, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson was asked why Republicans didn’t ""cut their way to solvency"" during the Bush administration in the 1990s.

Johnson, a deficit hawk elected in 2010, reacted to the word ""cut.""

""Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We’re trying to reduce the rate of growth in government,"" he said Feb. 13, 2013, on public radio station WUWM-FM (89.7) in Milwaukee. ""And that’s what we need to do. The fact of the matter is, the extreme position is to do nothing on either Social Security or Medicare, because those programs are going broke.""

The bitter partisan warfare over who is cutting what and by how much can obscure the true nature of various deficit-relief plans.

So let’s test Johnson’s claim that ""nobody in total is proposing cutting anything."" Rather, he claims, officials are ""trying to reduce the rate of growth in government.""

In the case of Johnson, we’ve been down this road before, but with the shoe on the other foot.

In defeating liberal Democrat Russ Feingold in 2010, it was Johnson who portrayed limits on spending growth in Medicare -- supported by Feingold in the federal health care law -- as ""cuts"" that would harm seniors.

Now it’s Johnson who complains that critics misconstrue caps on the rate of spending growth as ""cuts.""

Such is politics.

But let’s look at the core issue raised by Johnson’s comments.

In Johnson’s two years, have he and fellow Republicans advocated limits on federal spending growth -- or have they actually tried to shrink the budget from its current size?

Over the next decade, looking at federal spending as a whole, it’s clear that the intent is to slow the growth rate. You can see that in U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposals, in the sequester set to take effect in March 2013 and in various spending-cap proposals pushed by Republican lawmakers. To be sure, the measures propose significant and often controversial reductions in spending over multiple years compared with current rates of growth, but they do not shrink the budget below current spending over the course of a decade.

A few Johnson-specific examples:

He supported both Ryan budgets. He signed onto the Contract from America plan to put a per-capita inflation cap on spending growth. He backed a spending-cap proposal by U.S. Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and U.S. Sen. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) that tied spending to economic growth.

And Johnson’s comments in various forums, most recently in January, make clear he endorses limits on total growth.

In the Ryan budgets, it’s notable that in the first year of the 10-year projections, his blueprints called for spending less in year one than the year before.

Federal budget plans typically are framed in 10-year increments, though, and spending rises in every year but the first under his plans. So Johnson’s point is not knocked down by this, but it’s something to consider when evaluating his claim.

It’s also worth noting that Johnson praised the 2012 Ryan proposal but said it wasn’t aggressive enough in limiting growth.

When you look more narrowly at specific categories of spending, instead of the whole budget, Ryan’s proposals did indeed make actual year-to-year cuts -- and over the long-term.

Example: Ryan’s fiscal year 2012 plan proposed a cut in Medicaid outlays for that year, and didn’t get them back to the previous level until 2019.

And Ryan’s 2012 plan cut non-defense discretionary programs by 25 percent over 10 years.

Johnson, for his part, has endorsed enormous cuts on an agency-by-agency basis -- and even talks of eliminating some agencies entirely. In a January 2013 interview with The Daily Caller, Johnson said he’d go across the board.

""I truly believe that any of these agencies could easily withstand a 10 or 20 percent across the board cut and still be able to perform their function,"" he told reporter Alex Pappas.

Pappas quoted Johnson saying ""an awful lot of these"" agencies ""probably have a harmful effect on the economy anyways, so I don’t necessarily want to maintain their function.""

Johnson has also scoffed at the size of the looming cuts called for in the sequester, which supposedly was a poison pill so horrible that it would force lawmakers to compromise to avoid swallowing the automatic, across-the-board cuts. A recent Congressional Budget Office estimate said the sequester would cost the United States 750,000 jobs in 2013 alone.

Johnson said the sequester’s cuts over 10 years amount to ""barely a rounding error"" in the giant federal budget. He spoke on WTMJ-AM (620)  radio in Milwaukee on February 14, 2013, about the sequester, which totals more than $1 trillion over a decade.

So it’s clear Johnson supports steep budget cuts in some areas in order to slow the overall budget’s growth curve.

Our rating

Johnson said: ""Nobody in total is proposing cutting anything. We’re trying to reduce the rate of growth in government.""

While Johnson supports deep cutbacks in some budget areas, he and fellow Republicans repeatedly have made clear that in Washington budget-speak -- which typically covers 10-year increments -- they are talking about limiting the size of future spending increases.

Those growth limits likely would mean significant program changes and fewer federal employees.

But the budget would still grow overall.

We’ve examined similar claims. PolitiFact National debunked Democrats’ claims in 2011 that Ryan’s budget would ""end"" Medicare. And it declared Mostly False claims in 2010 by Republicans that the federal health care law cut hundreds of billions of dollars from Medicare at the elderly’s expense.

Both ratings rested in part on the recognition that Medicare’s budget would continue to grow, just at a slower pace, under the cost-savings plans.

Johnson’s claim is something of a reverse image of those claims, though on a grander scale. With the points of clarification noted above, we think his main point is on target.

Congressman uses wrong words on gun claim
","
Some gun control critics are using a similar talking point in the national debate over this issue.

PolitiFact Georgia spotted two recent claims on the topic that show the importance of being precise when making an argument on an issue. One speaker got it right. The other person made a more general statement on guns and got it wrong. 
Our odyssey began when an interesting comment by a state senator started making the rounds at the Georgia Capitol and on Twitter.

""There's more murders with hammers last year than...shotguns and pistols and AK-47s,"" said state Sen. Bill Jackson, a Republican from Appling. 
Two days after Jackson’s statement, U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens, was quoted by Slate.com on the same topic.

""There are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns,"" said Broun, who believes in limited government and is running for the U.S. Senate in 2014.

We quickly discovered our partners at other PolitiFact operations have examined similar claims before. Here’s what they found:

In January, some Facebook posts began to circulate that were critical of the White House’s proposal to restrict the availability of some weapons.

""Facts gun control advocates don’t want you to know. According to the FBI, in 2011, 1,694 were murdered with knives, 726 with hands or feet, 496 with clubs or hammers, 323 with rifles of any type. But Obama wants to ban semi-automatic rifles?"" it read.

The FBI figures also showed that 356 people were killed with shotguns.

PolitiFact reviewed 2011 FBI data on the types of weapons used to commit murders. The numbers posted on Facebook nearly matched the FBI data. The Facebook post of how many people were killed with hands or feet was two below the FBI total of 728.

A few weeks later, our partners at PolitiFact Texas examined a similar claim from that state’s attorney general, Greg Abbott.

 ""FBI: More people killed with hammers & clubs each year than rifles,"" Abbott said in a Twitter post.

He supplied a link to a Jan. 3, 2013, Fox News commentary piece that originated on the conservative website Breitbart.com and referred to FBI murder statistics from 2005 through 2011.

PolitiFact Texas noted Abbott used selective data to base his claim. That said, PolitiFact Texas noted, it is correct that FBI data indicates that in 2011, more people were killed with ""clubs and hammers"" than with any type of rifle. They rated his claim True.

Our efforts to reach Broun were unsuccessful.

Broun’s statement is not as specific as Jackson, whose claim we rated True, and the others. FBI data shows that 6,220 Americans were murdered by handguns in 2011. That’s more than 12 times the number of people killed with clubs or hammers, not including how many people were killed by other types of guns.

Broun’s claim that there are more people killed with baseball bats and hammers than are killed with guns was less specific. Broun’s general use of ""guns"" by its nature includes handguns. That makes his statement way off.

FBI statistics show that 8,583 people were killed with all guns in 2011 -- most of them (6,220) with handguns.

Broun is a congressman who has inserted himself directly into the heated gun debate. And he’s now running for the U.S. Senate. His high-profile run for higher office means that more of his statements will end up in the glare of the spotlight. And some of them could combust.

Our rating for Broun: Pants on Fire.

Will Washington leave Oregon 'holding the bag' on Columbia River Crossing?
","
Lawmakers in Oregon and Washington are expected to vote this year on local funding for the Columbia River Crossing, raising the stakes of the political wrangling around the replacement of the Interstate 5 bridge.

Inthe early planning stages of the CRC, officials in Oregon and Washington agreed to split the cost of the bridge, which could be as much as $3.5 billion. Oregon’s Gov. John Kitzhaber included $450 million in state funding for the bridge in his proposed 2013-15 budget. (The rest of the money is supposed to come from Washington, the federal government and tolls on the bridge.)

Metro Councilor Bob Stacey says Oregon could wind up paying more, thanks to provisions of a 2012 bill passed by the Washington Legislature that approves tolling of the new Interstate 5 corridor. Amendments to that bill put a $3.412 billion funding cap on the project and barred tolling on the Interstate 205 bridge, which also crosses the Columbia River between Portland and Vancouver.

In a memo to the Metro Council, Stacey said that the Oregon Legislature needs to fight back with provisions of its own -- making light rail a priority and limiting Oregon’s spending on the project to $450 million. ""If Oregon’s Legislature simply authorizes $450 million for the CRC, it will be implicitly accepting Washington’s limitations, which will leave Oregon holding the bag for a great deal more cost responsibility — or with a great deal less from the CRC project for our communities.""

Mega-projects like interstate bridges are complicated, but we were surprised to hear that something Washington did could leave Oregon ""holding the bag.""  We thought we’d check.

First, let’s look at tolling. Federal law generally prohibits tolling on an interstate bridge unless the money is used to pay for the bridge. That makes the Washington Legislature’s prohibition of tolling on the I-205 bridge meaningless because neither state could do it without a federal waiver.

With no tolls on I-205, Stacey could be right in saying that drivers would avoid the I-5 bridge and go to I-205. It is also possible, as he says, that tolls from the new bridge could be less than projected. That would create a shortfall in paying for the bridge.

If that happens, who is holding the bag?

To answer that, let’s go back to the original interstate agreement to build the bridge. In 2006, Oregon and Washington representatives signed an intergovernmental agreement stating that both state transportation departments are ""to jointly be responsible for the cost of the Columbia River Crossing Project.""

Sounded like an even split to us, but to be sure,we checked with officials in both Oregon and Washington.

Pat Egan, chair of the Oregon Transportation Commission, says jointly means equally. ""That’s the declared working agreement,"" Egan said.

Egan said he’s confident the final price tag for the bridge will be closer to $3 billion than $3.5 billion. But even if the bridge exceeds the cap,  he said, it will be up to both legislative bodies to approve more funding.

North of the river, we talked to Sen. Ann Rivers, the La Center Republican who wrote the Washington project cap amendment. She wants to control the costs but doesn’t see Washington doing that unilaterally. ""I think we can count on overruns and I expect them to be split evenly,"" she said.

But what about that cap that Washington passed?

History shows it may be better to think of the cap as a goal. Legislative bodies pass capital plans, including caps. Sometimes costs go up. Lawmakers don’t like it, but they usually approve more money. The city of Portland approved additional funds for the Portland Aerial Tram when it went over budget, for instance, and the Oregon Transportation Commission did the same this year for the rebuilding of U.S. 20.

In the end, Stacey’s right that if legislators greenlight the CRC, the state could ultimately owe more than $450 million on its share of the bridge. But setting a cap on the project or limiting Oregon’s share with legislative riders won’t stop that. And thanks to the agreement between Oregon and Washington to pay for the bridge jointly, if Oregon ever needs to pay more, Washington would need to join in.

PolitiFact Oregon doesn’t do prophecy. We can’t say whether the bridge will be over budget -- as much as history might tempt us to offer a guess.

What we can say is that the Washington toll rule won’t matter. The Washington Legislature’s cap won’t matter. Bottom line? The intergovernmental agreement covers the responsibility. Both states are left holding the bag.

Stacey’s statement is inaccurate. We rule it False.",/factchecks/2013/feb/20/bob-stacey/will-washington-leave-oregon-holding-bag-columbia-/

Wayne LaPierre says Phoenix is 'one of the kidnapping capitals of the world'
","
National Rifle Association executive vice president Wayne LaPierre attracted wide media attention recently when he suggested in an op-ed that after Hurricane Sandy, New York City had become a violent, post-apocalyptic wasteland -- thanks to an absence of guns.

A reader asked us to check out a claim in LaPierre’s op-ed, which ran on Feb. 13, 2013, op-ed in the conservative Daily Caller. ""Latin American drug gangs have invaded every city of significant size in the United States,"" LaPierre said. ""Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world, and though the states on the U.S.-Mexico border may be the first places in the nation to suffer from cartel violence, by no means are they the last.""

The claim that ""Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world"" was already familiar to us, since we had debunked it in 2010 (it was a finalist for our Lie of the Year). But that was three years ago, so we decided to take another look.

The NRA did not respond to an inquiry for this story. But we found a lot happened in the interim -- though the statement is still wrong.

What we found in 2010

Our original fact-check, coming at a time when Arizona’s tough immigration law known as SB 1070 was a major topic nationally, looked at a comment by Texas Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. He said that Phoenix ""is now the No. 2 kidnapping capital in the world, right behind Mexico City.""

ABC first reported on Feb. 11, 2009, that: ""Phoenix, Ariz., has become the kidnapping capital of America, with more incidents than any other city in the world outside of Mexico City and over 370 cases last year alone."" Several news organizations then repeated it, including the Associated Press, the Arizona Republic and United Press International. The Los Angeles Times went so far as to note that Phoenix ""police received 366 kidnapping-for-ransom reports"" in 2008 and that they estimate ""twice that number go unreported.""
   
However, none of the stories cited an authoritative source for the ranking or for how the kidnapping ranking was calculated. We did extensive checking and couldn't find anything to back it up.

We found that neither the FBI nor the U.S. National Central Bureau of Interpol, an arm of the U.S. Department of Justice that serves as the United States' representative to the international police organization, compiles city-based kidnapping statistics.

We also contacted Daniel Johnson, an overseas kidnapping operations consultant at ASI Global, a Houston company that coaches clients through kidnappings. ""From our internal experience in the last year,"" he said, ""Mexico by far has been the biggest location for kidnappings"" followed by Honduras, Venezuela, Nigeria and the Philippines. The company has handled domestic cases but said they don't compare in volume to overseas incidents.

This fit broadly with the perspective of Scott Stewart, vice president of tactical intelligence for Stratfor, an Austin, Texas global intelligence company. ""According to our analysts, there is no way that Phoenix is the No. 2 city in the world for kidnapping, and there are significantly more kidnappings in many other cities throughout Latin America,"" he told us in 2010.

A Stratfor spokesman reached for this article said Stewart’s comments remain accurate today, and we found evidence to back up high and often growing rates of kidnapping in Latin America. In all of Mexico, the official count for 2012 was four kidnappings a day, though a non-governmental organization pegged it at an astronomical 72 per day. Meanwhile, in Venezuela, the official statistics show kidnapping rates rising from 44 in 1999, to 1,105 in 2011, not counting ""express"" kidnappings, in which a perpetrator forcibly takes a victim from ATM to ATM until their checking account is depleted. Police sources told the newspaper El Universal that Caracas alone experiences perhaps two express kidnappings a day.

But there’s no good way to compare cities, and even countries, Johnson and Stewart agreed. It's ""extremely difficult to measure given the fact that so many cases go unreported and that the recordkeeping in many of the most affected countries is inaccurate."" Even among countries that track kidnappings, Johnson said, the definition of ""kidnap"" varies.

In 2010, we concluded that there was no evidence proving that Phoenix was No. 2 in kidnappings worldwide. We rated the statement False.

Subsequent doubt cast on Phoenix’s 2008 statistics

Since then, there have been additional revelations that indicate the claim is still wrong.

Prompted by media coverage of the Phoenix kidnapping claim, an investigative team led by reporter Dave Biscobing of ABC-15 TV news in Phoenix spent two months in 2011 reviewing the city police department's 2008 statistics. They concluded that ""Phoenix police routinely inflated their kidnapping statistics throughout the year, including at least 100 cases that legal experts said should not have been counted, plus dozens of other questionable reports.""

Among the problems cited by ABC-15 was that the count included ""cases where officers concluded no kidnapping occurred, reports that were counted multiple times, and even reports for kidnappings that happened in other cities and other states.""

In one case, a police report described a woman ""claiming she was abducted from a Wal-Mart parking lot and then driven around for hours. But when officers checked surveillance video, they watched her get into her car and drive away -- alone."" She had made up the story.

There were other new developments -- a police department whistleblower who said the numbers were inflated, a city audit that insisted they had not -- but they either failed to support the kidnapping-capital claim or further knocked it down. The city's police chief lost his job at least partly because of the controversy.

Last year, an investigation by the Justice Department's inspector general looked into the numbers because the city had used them in a grant application. The investigation found  that of the 358 incidents submitted as support for the grant applications, only 208 met Arizona’s requirements of a kidnapping, and only 195 met a uniform crime reporting standard. Phoenix then submitted an additional 175 cases -- two years after its initial grant application -- which enabled the inspector general’s certified count to reach exactly 358 under Arizona standards. The count stood at 254 under the more stringent uniform crime reporting standards.

The inspector general concluded that even if the data Phoenix submitted late was counted, the city ""likely overstates the number of kidnappings,"" and it argued that the Phoenix Police Department ""has significant problems with its coding and classification of cases and, consequently, with the accuracy of reports from its case management system.""

Meanwhile, it’s worth pointing out that, as we noted in our previous fact-check, kidnapping levels in Phoenix have fallen from their 2008 peak of 358 in 2008 to 318 in 2009 and 105 from January through May 2010, which amounts to an annualized total of 252 kidnappings for 2010.

In the wake of the controversy, we were unable to obtain more recent data for this story. A police spokesman declined to provide new data.

Our ruling

LaPierre bought himself a little running room by avoiding specific international rankings and claiming instead that ""Phoenix is already one of the kidnapping capitals of the world."" Still, we find no justification to support such a sweeping claim.

Two and a half years later, there remains no reliable international comparison for city kidnapping rates, and an independent expert continues to express skepticism about the claim. In addition, federal investigators have given credibility to claims by ABC-15's investigative reporters and a whistleblower that the city’s claim of 300-plus kidnappings in 2008 were exaggerated. Finally, the most recent official numbers for Phoenix show a decline since 2008 even as kidnappings have soared in several Latin American countries. We rate LaPierre’s claim False.",/factchecks/2013/feb/19/wayne-lapierre/wayne-lapierre-says-phoenix-one-kidnapping-capital/

Steny Hoyer: House Democrats won majority of 2012 popular vote
","
Republicans control the U.S. House of Representatives by 33 seats, an advantage Speaker John Boehner once suggested gives them a mandate to block tax increases.

Some House Democrats have countered this idea with their own talking point: GOP members may control more seats, but they did not win the popular vote in 2012.

U.S. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, mentioned it to Capitol reporters on Feb. 12, 2013.

""The American people elected a Democratic president, a Democratic Senate, and the majority of them voted for a Democratic House, but we have a Republican House, and it's necessary for all sides to come together and take responsible action,"" Hoyer said.

It’s a claim that’s been repeated several times in recent months, so we decided to check it out.

Hoyer spokeswoman Stephanie Young directed us to a December 2012 analysis by the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan, Washington, D.C. publication that analyzes and handicaps congressional and gubernatorial races, with the headline ""House GOP Won 49 Percent of Votes, 54 Percent of Seats."" (The story and corresponding chart are accessible to subscribers only.)

By Cook’s calculations, House Democrats out-earned their Republican counterparts by 1.17 million votes. Read another way, Democrats won 50.59 percent of the two-party vote. Still, they won just 46.21 percent of seats, leaving the Republicans with 234 seats and Democrats with 201.

It was the second time in 70 years that a party won the majority of the vote but didn’t win a majority of the House seats, according to the analysis.

The National Republican Congressional Committee did not dispute these findings. NRCC spokesman Dan Scarpinato pointed out that Republicans enjoy a comfy majority, their second largest since World War II (234 seats in 2012, 242 seats in 2010).

Cook’s House editor David Wasserman pointed to two ""unprecedented"" factors that explain the phenomenon: the thick concentration of Democratic votes in urban areas and the GOP’s wide control of drawing congressional districts in 2010.

For the record, Wasserman considers the House popular vote an imperfect read of the nation’s attitude about House party control, for several reasons. Weak opposition to incumbents in many districts will usually lead to a bloated vote count for the incumbent party. In some districts, a ""personally popular moderate"" will usually outperform his or her party’s national popularity. And a new top-two primary system in California, which featured eight districts with races between two Democrats or two Republicans, meant the other party did not get any votes in some cases.

Regardless, he wrote, House Democrats will need to win 55 percent of all House votes cast in order to win a majority of seats for the next decade. (That has only happened twice in the last 15 cycles, he wrote.)

What if we consider votes for candidates whose political party is not Democratic or Republican?

Michael McDonald, George Mason University public affairs professors, says it’s almost certain the Democrats would not maintain their majority of the popular vote. However, the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives, which publishes official vote counts of federal elections, has not yet posted its 2012 tally. (McDonald thought the delay in posting may be due to New York pushing back its reporting due to Hurricane Sandy.)

Still, ""I am certain we will find that the Democrats received more votes than Republicans,"" McDonald said.

Wasserman compiled his own tally of the national popular vote for House races. With the addition of late December data from New York, the Democratic advantage widened to 1.36 million votes.

According to his breakdown, House Democratic candidates got 49.15 percent of the vote, Republicans got 48.03 percent, and other candidates got 2.81 percent. Again, that means the Democrats gained a plurality of the vote.

Looking at the data this way shows that third parties, not Democrats, are really more disenfranchised in terms of votes versus seats, said Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California.

""They win almost 3 percent of the vote but get 0 percent of the seats,"" McGhee said.

Our ruling

Hoyer said the majority of Americans ""voted for a Democratic House.""  We found an impartial and thorough analysis that supports his claim, at least when considering votes for the two dominant parties. Indeed, Democrats earned a majority.

When considering votes for candidates of all parties, House Democrats still earned the most votes. But the share is a plurality, not a majority. It’s a small but noteworthy difference.

Rep. Dave Joyce says millions of U.S. jobs go unfilled each month
","
While the rest of the nation celebrated Mardi Gras on Feb. 12, official Washington was transfixed by a different spectacle: delivery of President Barack Obama’s yearly State of the Union speech. Newly elected Congressman Dave Joyce watched the hour-long oration on the House of Representatives floor with his House and Senate colleagues and was up the next morning to discuss it with radio talk show host and Plain Dealer columnist Mike McIntyre on WCPN’s ""The Sound of Ideas"" call-in program.

The Russell Township Republican told McIntyre he heard plenty of familiar themes in Obama’s speech, and said many of the president’s solutions to problems ""seemed to involve more big government."" But Joyce said he was intrigued by Obama’s call for providing high school students with a more technical education that will help them get better jobs after graduation. During the speech, Obama highlighted a school in Brooklyn, N.Y. that graduates students with both a high school diploma and an associates degree in computers or engineering.

""We need to better prepare our workforce for the jobs that we have,"" Joyce said. ""There are three million jobs that go vacant each month in this country, so the idea of trying to better prepare our children for the workforce by reforming high schools and stressing technical degrees in engineering, that is something that intrigues me. It’s something that people in other districts hear from their people, who said we have difficulty finding competent workers.""

PolitiFact was intrigued by Joyce’s assertion that three million U.S. jobs go unfilled every month. Could that be true that a nation with a 7.9 percent unemployment in January, 2013 actually has so many job openings?

Joyce’s press secretary referred us to monthly job openings reports produced by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. A Feb. 12 report that covered statistics from December 2012 said there were 3.6 million job openings on the last day of the year, a number that varied little throughout 2012.  The report said that during 2012, hires totaled 51.8 million and separations totaled 50.0 million, yielding a net employment gain of 1.8 million.

Reports the office issued for previous months in 2012 indicated there were 3.8 million job openings in June, 3.7 million job openings in November, October , July,   May and March,  3.6 million openings in September and August, 3.5 million vacancies in January and February, and 3.4 million unfilled jobs in April,

So why are there so many unfilled jobs? Employers maintain there’s a skills gap, while some labor economists say that skilled workers desire more pay than employers want to provide.

A Bloomberg.com article on the subject said U.S. companies have reported more than 3 million job openings every month since February 2011. The article quoted Anthony Carnevale, who heads the Georgetown University Center on Education and the Workforce in Washington, D.C., saying there’s a demand for workers with highly specific skills. The article described a growing skills gap as a global problem, quoting a McKinsey Global Institute study that said employers worldwide could face a shortage of 85 million high- and medium-skilled workers by 2020. It also highlighted a Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center program that helps unskilled workers train for better paid, skilled jobs in fields such as nursing.

""‘Qualified’ used to mean a high school degree,"" Carnevale told Bloomberg.  ""Now the qualification level has gone up so they’re pressing for better people.""

A Nov. 11 segment on CBS News’ ""60 Minutes"" said that manufacturers nationwide say the lack of skilled workers is the reason for hundreds of thousands of unfilled jobs. But it quoted management professor Peter Capelli of the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School of Business saying that if companies paid better, they might be able to get the higher skilled workers they say they need.

""This is a market. And so, you know, if you're not willing to pay more, don't expect to get better quality people,"" Capelli said. ""One of the things we know now is wages are not going up. In fact, they've been stagnant and some cases even declining over time. So where is the shortage?""

Capelli also noted that a generation ago, companies provided workers with the training they needed.

""Companies are now saying, for all kinds of reasons, ""We're not going to do it anymore,"" Capelli told ""60 Minutes."" ""And maybe they're right, they can't do it. But what they probably can't do is say, ‘We're not going to do it, and it's your problem. It's your problem to provide us with what we need, Mr. and Mrs. Taxpayer. You need to pay for this for us.""

Alcoa Inc. CEO Klaus Kleinfeld provided a counterpoint to Capelli’s views. Kleinfeld said he believes manufacturing jobs pay ""very, very well,"" and that Alcoa is making efforts to fill the skills gap as are many other businesses. Asked why there’s still a skills gap if manufacturing is attempting to close it, Kleinfield replied: ""This is not a society where you can tell somebody what - where to go, or where to - what education to get, right?’

Pete Winstead says Austin is the largest U.S. city without a nonstop flight to Europe
","
Austin lawyer Pete Winstead is negotiating with European airlines to start nonstop service from Austin, according to a Feb. 6, 2013, news story by KUT News in Austin.

The story reported that Winstead said Austin is the largest city in the U.S. without ""direct flights"" to Europe. Stopping along the way increases chances for delays that could cause a business executive to miss a meeting, Winstead said.

""Nonstop air service, even if it leaves Austin 30 minutes late, is not a big problem,"" he told KUT.

Not that PolitiFact Texas is planning any European vacations, but we decided to check the departure boards. Do the United States’ biggest cities all have a nonstop option Austinites don’t?

Austin passed San Francisco last year to become the 13th largest U.S. city, according to the most recent Census Bureau news. The Top 12: New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose, Jacksonville and Indianapolis.

Austin-Bergstrom International Airport spokesman Jim Halbrook told us by phone that no carriers have a nonstop passenger flight from Austin to Europe.

Eight of the nine largest cities have nonstop flights to Europe. Sample itinerary: If you depart Dallas/Fort Worth International on American Airlines at 5 p.m, you can be in Paris nine hours and 40 minutes later. Hop a British Airways plane in San Diego at 10:10 p.m. and you’ll be at London’s Heathrow Airport in 10 hours and 25 minutes.

San Antonio ranks seventh by size, and although San Antonio International Airport has nonstop flights to Mexico, spokeswoman Nora Castro told us by phone that it has no nonstops to Europe.

Spokespeople for the San Jose, Jacksonville and Indianapolis airports told us by phone that they do not have nonstop flights to Europe. All but Jacksonville have international nonstops -- San Jose to Tokyo, Austin to Cancún, etc. -- but none go to Europe. For a table showing all 13 cities and giving specific destinations, click here.

We also checked to see how the claim holds up if we go beyond the city limits and compare the greater Austin area to other metro areas. According to the Census Bureau, in 2011 the Austin-Round Rock-San Marcos area ranked 34th among the country's biggest metropolitan statistical areas, with nearly 1.8 million residents.

Both the San Antonio and San Jose regions were larger, so Austin’s not the biggest metro area with no Europe nonstop flight, either.

Our ruling

Winstead said Austin was the largest U.S. city without a nonstop flight to Europe. But four larger cities lack such flights, making this statement False.",/factchecks/2013/feb/19/pete-winstead/pete-winstead-says-austin-largest-us-city-without-/

Cantor says states are spending more on Medicaid than on public schools
","
House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, is urging lawmakers to make Medicaid more flexible, effective and cheaper for states to run.

""Under the Medicaid system the rules are set in Washington, but much of the bills are paid in our state capitals,"" he said during his Feb. 5 ""Make Life Work"" speech at a conservative think tank in Washington  ""Collectively states are spending more on Medicaid than they do on K-12 education.""

We looked into the claim that states are paying more for Medicaid than public education. Cantor’s staff told us the information came from a report, published by the National Association of State Budget Officers last fall, that tallied where states get and spend their money.

The study found that states planned to spend a total $1.7 trillion in fiscal 2012. Of the sum, 39.8 percent would come from general fund moneys that are collected through statewide taxes, 31.2 percent from federal grants and the remaining 29 percent from other state funds and bonds.

Medicaid, which provides health care for the poor, was expected to be the most expensive item in the collective state budgets. States were projected to spend $406 billion on the service, or 23.9 percent of their total budgets. Elementary and secondary education came in second, drawing $336 billion, or 19.8 percent of total expenses.

But there’s a catch to these figures: The federal government provides states with about 56 percent of what they spend on Medicaid, according to NASBO report. So Cantor is including as state expenses about $228 billion that Uncle Sam sends to the states for Medicaid.

The picture changes if we simply examine the portions of Medicaid and public education that states pay out of their general funds. Public schools rise to the top of the expense list, drawing an expected $235 billion last fiscal year, or 34.7 percent of all general fund spending. Medicaid falls to a distant No. 2, receiving an estimated $133 billion, or 19.6 percent of general fund outlays.

Experts we spoke to didn’t express a preference for one accounting method or the other.

""We include both methods in our report,"" said Stacy Mazer, senior staff associate at NASBO. ""One reason we’ve been using total funds is that some states define their funds differently. And one of the other issues is that even though it’s not all your money, you’re still administering it.""

Tracy Gordon, a fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, said most health care industry analysts use a total figure cited by Cantor, but note that it includes federal dollars.

Arturo Perez, a fiscal analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures, said his organization tracks states’ general fund spending and considers K-12 education to be the greatest recipient of state money.

Our ruling

Cantor said states are spending more on Medicaid than on education. His statement is correct, although it should be noted that a substantial portion of the dollars states are spending on Medicaid come from the federal government.

Does Obama get an A for early care claim?
","
President Barack Obama called on Congress to expand access to early childhood education in his State of the Union address.

""Every dollar we invest in high-quality early childhood education can save more than $7 later on – by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy, even reducing violent crime,"" Obama said.

Obama name-dropped Georgia and Oklahoma as states that have prioritized early education, and traveled to an early childhood education program in Decatur to reinforce his point. The president used nearly the same language about the economic benefits of early education in his speech at the College Heights Early Childhood Learning Center in Decatur and posted the claim on his Twitter account.

We wanted to know whether ""high-quality"" pre-school really provides states about $7 in bang for their buck and whether Obama’s right about the other aspects of these programs.

Obama is touting a number familiar in the debate on Head Start, the federal program created by President Lyndon Johnson in 1965 that aims to prepare children from birth to age 5 from low-income families for school. Services for enrolled children and their families include health, nutrition, social services and education. Others have questioned efforts by Georgia and other states to implement universal preschool for 4-year-olds, citing the cost and its results.

A White House official referred us to a recent report on a prominent long-term study aimed at determining whether early education programs can have a positive impact on a child’s future. A White House fact sheet says Obama plans to expand the federal government’s Early Head Start program, which serves children from birth to age 3.

First, let’s look at whether the president’s math is correct.

In the early 1960s, a team of researchers started what’s known as the HighScope Perry Preschool Program. The study targeted 123 economically disadvantaged, at-risk African-American children in a small town called Ypsilanti, Mich., which is about 30 miles from Detroit. Fifty-eight of them were randomly selected to participate in a program to which they had access to early care education; the rest received no preschool program. The 123 students were tracked over various stages of their childhood and at the ages of 19 and 27.

Obama’s press team pointed us to a University of Chicago’s report that analyzed the benefit-cost ratio for the Perry program in the footsteps of other studies. The paper said ""each dollar invested returns in present value terms 7 to 12 dollars back to society.""

A 1999 report by the Libertarian Cato Institute concluded there’s scant empirical evidence to back up the claim that there is a $7 return for each dollar invested in these programs.

Our friends at PolitiFact Ohio explored a similar claim about the economic effectiveness of Head Start in 2011. Their fact check focused on a 2007 study on Head Start by Jens Ludwig, a University of Chicago professor, and Deborah A. Phillips of Georgetown University. PolitiFact Ohio rated the claim Mostly True.

W. Steven Barnett, a co-director of the National Institute for Early Education Research at Rutgers University, wrote a commentary where he included a benefit-cost analysis using data from three programs similar to Head Start (including Perry). The estimated return for Perry was 16.1 to 1.

Now, let’s examine whether Obama has a point about the impact of early education on graduation rates, teen pregnancy and crime.

The students who had access to the early education program in Michigan were more likely to graduate from high school and earn higher salaries, and less likely to be arrested, Perry researchers concluded.

One of the University of Chicago researchers also told us that they found girls who enrolled in the early care program were half as likely to be pregnant as teenagers compared with those who did not enroll in the program.

Some researchers are less impressed by the Perry program, saying the sample of students studied was too small and it was designed to help enrollees do well.

The author of the 1999 Cato study cites other research that says students who enrolled in the Perry program dropped out of school at higher rates than students who were not considered at-risk and that there is no consensus on what components of the program were responsible for the children's gains.

Regarding Head Start, some researchers found children who experienced Head Start were more likely to finish high school and have better jobs with greater earning power, and less likely to commit crime when they grew up. They also thought an emphasis on medical screenings and preventive care reduced Medicaid expenses.

Head Start critics say the program is inefficient and wasteful. Some point to a 2010 U.S. Department of Health and Human Services study of Head Start that showed few advantages by the end of the third grade for students who entered the program as 3-year-olds as opposed to children who enrolled in Head Start at the age of 4.

Since Obama mentioned the programs in Georgia and Oklahoma, we thought we should see what has been the extended impact of them in those states.

A 2009 study of Georgia’s pre-k program concluded it was a positive learning environment, but ""leaders may want to consider increasing time spent on literacy and math while continuing to ensure that children engage in a broad array of activities."" Oklahoma news outlets have reported that fourth grade math and reading scores have declined in the past decade since that state was declared a leader in early education.

Our ruling

The president says every dollar the federal government invests in high-quality early education programs can save more than $7 later on by boosting graduation rates, reducing teen pregnancy and crime. Obama’s figure is widely shared and based on academic reports that have tried to determine the cost of Head Start and the Perry program.

Whether these programs are ""high-quality"" is a more difficult discussion. There is debate about the long-term effectiveness of the Perry program and of Head Start because there are so many factors involved in a child’s development after the child leaves these programs.

Additionally, there’s little research on the long-term impact of these programs in Georgia and Oklahoma, so the president’s remarks seem to be a stretch at this point.

The president’s statement is partially true but needs an awful lot of context to be fully understood.

Donald Rumsfeld says Abraham Lincoln loved wrestling
","
Last week's recommendation by the International Olympic Committee executive board to drop wrestling from the 2020 summer games prompted an outcry from lovers of the sport, including former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld.

The IOC has been overcome by ""kumbaya"" thinking and should restore wrestling to the 2020 lineup, wrote Rumsfeld in a Washington Post op-ed. Rumsfeld was a wrestler at Princeton University who tried unsuccessfully to make the U.S. Olympic squad in 1956.

In making his case, Rumsfeld noted that wrestling ""once was a favorite of Abraham Lincoln’s.""

We didn't realize the 16th president had been a wrestler, so we decided to check it out.

It didn't take long: We found Lincoln was so good that he's enshrined in the National Wrestling Hall of Fame, which says he recorded only one defeat in a dozen years.

Lincoln ""was an impressive physical specimen, thin but wiry and muscular, strengthened by hard work in the fields and towering to a mighty 6-feet, 4-inches in height,"" says an article on the Hall of Fame's website.

His most famous bout was against Jack Armstrong, a local bully and wrestling champion in New Salem, Ill. There are differing accounts of that bout, but the consensus is that Lincoln held his own against the ""local tough.""

Lincoln ""sure was the big buck of this lick,"" said one spectator.

His wrestling skills were celebrated in a TV ad for Diet Mountain Dew in which Lincoln strips off his shirt during the Lincoln-Douglas debates and begins throwing people off the stage. The tagline: ""FACT: Lincoln's favorite sport was wrestling.""

Sports Illustrated notes that Lincoln was not our only wrestling president. Other grapplers who made it to the White House include George Washington (school champ at the Reg. James Maury's Academy in Fredricksburg, Va.), Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur, Theodore Roosevelt and  William Taft, who ""mastered a wicked move called the Flying Marc that savagely flipped an opponent to the ground.""

John Cornyn said move to delay Hagel nomination is “not a filibuster”
","
Some Republicans in the U.S. Senate aren’t very happy that their old colleague, Chuck Hagel of Nebraska, has now been nominated to be President Barack Obama’s defense secretary.

Some don’t like what he said about the Iraq war. Others think he did a bad job at his confirmation hearings. Still others want to use the nomination to get more information out of the Obama administration about last year’s attacks on American diplomats in Benghazi, Libya.

So when majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada brought the Hagel nomination to the floor on Feb. 14, 2013, for a procedural vote known as ""cloture,"" he couldn't muster enough votes. Cloture requires 60 votes, and enough Republicans opposed the move so that cloture failed.

Reid complained that Republicans were obstructing for political reasons. ""We know how the tea party goes after Republicans when they aren’t conservative enough,"" Reid said. ""Is that something they need to have on their resume: I filibustered one of the President’s nominees? Is that what they want?""

Not so, Republicans replied.

""This is not any attempt to kill this nomination. This is not a filibuster,"" Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, said in the floor debate. ""I realize it is the headline the majority leader would like the newspapers to write.""

Rather than trying to kill the nomination, Cornyn said, senators simply wanted more information.

""There are reasonable requests being made on this side for additional information,"" Cornyn said. ""I hope and trust information will be provided in the next few days. When we come back from the recess, we will have another vote and another opportunity for senators to express themselves.""

So Reid said it was a filibuster; Cornyn said it wasn’t. Which is it?

Defining the filibuster

Our first step was to determine exactly what a filibuster is. It’s not specifically defined in Senate rules.

Still, the U.S. Senate’s own website has this to say: ""Using the filibuster to delay or block legislative action has a long history. The term filibuster -- from a Dutch word meaning ‘pirate’ -- became popular in the 1850s, when it was applied to efforts to hold the Senate floor in order to prevent a vote on a bill.""

The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a widely respected arm of Congress that prepares research for members, recently issued a detailed report on the filibuster.

""Filibustering includes any use of dilatory or obstructive tactics to block a measure by preventing it from coming to a vote,"" said the report published by the service on Nov. 29, 2012.

Hollywood’s version of the filibuster -- think Mr. Smith Goes to Washington -- is one senator standing alone on the floor and talking, talking, talking. Actually, a speech isn’t necessary to conduct a filibuster. The hallmark of the filibuster instead is that it forces a requirement for 60 votes rather than 51 to approve or move forward on a measure.

Hagel’s confirmation, like most other measures, will require only a simple majority if and when it gets to a vote.

Yes, it’s a filibuster

Several experts we spoke with said the failed cloture vote does constitute a filibuster.

""There's no single formal definition of a filibuster. The simplest version is that a filibuster occurs when a minority blocks a Senate majority from acting,"" said Sarah Binder, a political scientist and author of Stalemate: Causes and Consequences of Legislative Gridlock. ""Probably a more accurate definition involves ‘intent’: A minority blocks a Senate majority from acting with the intent of derailing the measure (or nomination).""

Binder said she thought cloture vote on the Hagel nomination was a filibuster: ""The GOP actions against Hagel constitute a filibuster because the majority has been prevented from getting to a vote on confirmation.""

Steven S. Smith, a professor of political science at Washington University in St. Louis, agreed. ""Jargon gets in the way. Minority obstruction is the key concept.  Minority obstruction occurred here,"" he said.

Another filibuster expert, Gregory Koger of the University of Miami, said it was a filibuster: ""In the modern Senate, ‘holding’ a nomination and forcing the majority to shut off debate using the cloture process is a filibuster. Under the rules of the Senate, nominations require a simple majority for approval. It is incorrect to suggest that a 60-vote threshold is normal, natural, or common.""

In Cornyn’s defense

Cornyn emphasized that the Hagel cloture vote was an attempt to get more information, not kill the nomination outright. And, it was Reid who chose to schedule the cloture vote when he did, before senators were satisfied, Cornyn said.

""This was the majority leader's choice, which was his prerogative, and the White House's choice. We could have done this differently,"" Cornyn said.

Cornyn’s office told us that on the day of the cloture vote, it had been 38 days since Hagel was nominated, not an unusually long time for a nominee to be under consideration. The staff also pointed us to comments from senators saying they expected Hagel would get a vote after the Senate returned from recess.

In the book Defending the Filibuster: The Soul of the Senate, Richard A. Arenberg and Robert B. Dove defend the filibuster as a moderating force and a check on executive power. The filibuster, they write, has a historic role ""as a protection of minority rights and a force for consensus building.""

We asked Arenberg whether he thought the Hagel case was a filibuster or not. He said it was a complicated case.

""The majority leader clearly wanted to have the vote prior to the impending recess, at least in part for tactical reasons,"" he said. ""Republicans who oppose the nomination want the nomination delayed until the day after the recess in order to seek answers to additional questions, but also to allow opponents time to marshal further opposition. ""

Traditionally, senators would work out requests for more time among themselves, without needing a cloture vote, he said, but that didn’t happen this time.

""It's hard to characterize this as a classic filibuster and in a sense, it does come closer to what is typically termed a ‘hold,’"" Arenberg said. ""Of course, holds don't exist in the Senate rules and have their roots in senatorial courtesy. There's not too much of that (courtesy) in this circumstance. In the end, answering the questions rests on an analysis of the motivations of those seeking delay and what you believe about the duration of the delay which they seek.""

Filibustering cabinet nominees

In Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Sen. Jefferson Smith is looked upon as a hero for conducting a filibuster.

But in our review of the news coverage of the Hagel nomination and recent reports on the filibuster, we can’t help but note that ""filibuster"" has come to have a distinctly negative connotation, synonymous with political obstruction.

Adding fuel to the fire here is that presidents usually get their cabinet nominees confirmed. While some nominees withdraw under political pressure before a confirmation vote, it’s rare for a nominee to make it to the floor and lose, much less be filibustered. The Washington Post recently reviewed the history of filibustering cabinet nominees and concluded that no nominations had failed because of an actual filibuster.  

 Our ruling

Cornyn said the failed cloture vote on Hagel was ""not a filibuster."" In fact-checking this statement, we’re swayed by definitions of filibusters that say it’s any move to prevent a measure or nomination from coming to a simple majority vote. The failed vote of Feb. 14 clearly delayed Hagel’s nomination from moving forward. Whether a filibuster itself is a positive assertion of minority rights or a negative instance of obstruction is in the eye of the beholder.

Still, the definition of a filibuster is not precise. Making things more complicated is that Cornyn and others have said they intend to allow a vote on Hagel’s nomination in the near future.

Overall, we rate Cornyn’s statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2013/feb/18/john-cornyn/john-cornyn-said-move-delay-hagel-nomination-not-f/

Marco Rubio says we've always needed foreign workers for farming
","
One reason the U.S. needs immigration reform is to ensure we have enough farm workers, says U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla.

Rubio was part of the bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" that unveiled an immigration framework in January. The framework includes a path to residency and citizenship for many of the 11 million undocumented immigrants and would give special consideration to farm workers, among other groups.

Rubio has been shopping around these principles to conservative news outlets, including a Jan. 30 column on the conservative RedState.com. Part of his column focused on immigrant farm labor.

""Agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad, but we do not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S.,"" Rubio wrote.

Rubio called for a ""modernized agricultural worker program"" that ""allows our growers to contract the seasonal and year round labor they need legally.""

The part that drew our attention was his broad claim that ""agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad."" We wondered whether it was accurate to make such a blanket statement without any parameters for time period or type of farm. In a related fact-check, we will explore whether the U.S. has a system for farmers to legally import foreign workers.

Rubio's evidence

Over the past 15 years, about half of the hired workers employed in U.S. crop agriculture were unauthorized, with the overwhelming majority of these workers coming from Mexico, according to research based on the U.S. Department of Labor’s National Agricultural Workers Survey. 
Rubio’s office sent us a few reports from government agencies and researchers that looked at the history of immigrant workers in agriculture. Most notably, there was the Bracero program, a program that brought in temporary farm workers mostly from Mexico between 1942 and 1964, peaking at almost a half-million workers, according to a 1965 U.S. Department of Agriculture report.

While that sounds like a significant number of foreign workers, they were more common in some places than others. Braceros primarily farmed vegetables, fruits, cotton and sugar beets, and they were concentrated in seven states: Arizona, Arkansas, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Michigan and Texas. By the 1960s, mechanization reduced the need for these workers for some crops.

Historians weigh in about Rubio’s claim

We interviewed several historians who specialize in American history, immigration or agriculture. They said it is difficult to generalize about the agricultural workforce, because it differs by time period, location and type of farm.

""It's not as simple as you might think,"" said University of Wisconsin professor Jess Gilbert in an email to PolitiFact. ""Certain types of U.S. farming use foreign workers, while others don't.""

Fruit and vegetable farms used a lot of hired labor. ""But these farms are a small proportion of all U.S. farms, the vast majority of which hire no labor and never have. This includes ‘family farms’ in most parts of the country, stereotypically the Midwest,"" Gilbert said.

Paul Conkin, a Vanderbilt history professor emeritus who wrote a book about American agriculture since 1929, said that Rubio’s claim ""is either completely wrong or misleading."" 
""Through most of our agricultural history, the workforce largely consisted of farm owners, family members, or one or two hired hands from the neighborhood,"" he said. ""Only since World War II have migratory workers become a major component of farm labor.""

Many of the professors we interviewed noted that in the South, farms relied on slave labor and later sharecroppers, and many of those people were born in the United States.

Columbia University history professor Eric Foner pointed to the Reconstruction period when he said southern plantation owners tried to import foreign workers, including Chinese, to drive down the wages of recently freed blacks.

""Very few came -- why go to work as an exploited plantation laborer when jobs were available to immigrants in northern factories?"" he said. ""This is often the underlying reason for agricultural producers claiming there is a shortage of labor and foreign workers are needed.""

William and Mary professor Cindy Hahamovitch said Rubio is on the right track, but that some of that immigrant workforce was forced to come here.

""In the colonial period most farm laborers would have been European indentured servants and African slaves, especially in the South. After the slave trade ban in 1808 and the Napoleonic Wars, there wasn't much immigration in the early 19th century, but some 30 million Europeans plus Asians and Mexicans arrived in the following century, and many of them would have done farm work.""

Philip Martin, a University of California professor, co-wrote a paper about migration and farmers that Rubio’s staff cited to us. ""Hired workers today are the majority of workers employed in U.S. agriculture, and most were born in Mexico,"" Martin said. ""But especially during the 1930s, most hired workers were U.S.-born, like the Okies and Arkies of Grapes of Wrath days.""

Our ruling

Rubio said that ""agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad.""

There have been certain time periods and types of farms that did use many foreign workers. But Rubio overgeneralized when he suggested that throughout American history, all types of farms needed foreign workers. Farms have also been owner-operated, with little need of a foreign work force.

Marco Rubio says U.S. farmers have no way to bring in workers legally
","
Sen. Marco Rubio says that one of the reasons we need immigration reform is to help farmers who don’t have a way to legally hire workers.

Rubio, R-Fla., and a bipartisan group of senators have put forward a major proposal on immigration, and Rubio has been defending it to conservative audiences, including in a Jan. 30 column on RedState.com. 
Rubio wrote that the country needs ""a stable and affordable domestic supply of food. ... Agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad, but we do not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S.""

Rubio called for a ""modernized agricultural worker program"" that ""allows our growers to contract the seasonal and year round labor they need legally.""

In a related fact-check, we explored his broad claim that ""Agriculture has always required a significant workforce from abroad."" Here we research whether the U.S. has a system for farmers to legally import foreign workers.

The H-2A seasonal visa process

The United States does have a system to allow farmers to hire seasonal workers. It’s called the H-2A visa program. But the H-2A visa program has several restrictions and has been widely criticized as inadequate.

We turned to a 2013 Congressional Research Service report to explain the process.

Farmers apply for certification from the Labor Department to ensure that U.S. workers are not available; the majority of these requests are granted. (Florida ranks fifth for the number of granted certifications.)

Employers then submit a petition to the Department of Homeland Security to bring in foreign workers. If that application is approved, foreign workers can go to a U.S. embassy or consulate and apply for the visa from the State Department.

Employers must meet a list of requirements, including providing workers with housing, transportation, and other benefits, such as workers’ compensation insurance. No health insurance coverage is required.

The number of H-2A visas have soared from about 6,500 in 1992 to a high of about 64,400 in 2008. There were about 55,400 H-2A visas issued in 2011, based on preliminary data.

However, despite that growth, the program is small relative to total farm employment. For example in 2007, (the most recent Census of Agriculture from the USDA) there were about 2.6 million hired farm workers and about 50,800 H-2A visas granted.

""Critics of the H-2A program cite the low levels of participation as evidence of the program’s inadequacy to meet the needs of U.S. agricultural employers,"" the Congressional Research Service said. ""Others, however, attribute the program’s low utilization to the availability of unauthorized workers, who are willing to work for lower wages than legal workers.""

Many farm groups and a bipartisan group of senators, including Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., have complained that the process is too difficult and doesn't provide enough workers. 
The program requires that workers be temporary or seasonal. Many agriculture jobs -- for example livestock or dairy farms -- require year-round labor, and a coalition of farm groups is pushing for an 11-month a year guest worker program.

""There is a legal program,"" said Debby Wechsler, executive secretary of the North Carolina Strawberry Association. ""It is considered by agriculture to be broken and needing to be fixed. Rubio is definitely wrong when he says there is no program now, but he is right when he says something needs to be done.""

Ervin Lineberger, who owns a North Carolina blackberry and grape farm, told PolitiFact that he looked into using the H-2A program a couple of times and concluded that it wouldn’t work for him. One problem was that he would have to supply housing, and he only does that now for four workers, though he hires 50 -- mostly Mexicans -- during the season. 
Last year he turned to unemployed U.S. citizens, and of the 15 he hired, ""only one was with me when we finished the season."" Some were too out of shape for the farm work or didn’t want to work on weekends, he said.

""There is a need for a process where, especially the Mexican workers, can come here legally and go home legally,"" he said.

Steve Camarota, director of research for the Center for Immigration Studies, which calls for low-immigration, said that the H-2A program works well for some and not others.

""The key question is, are farmers so used to paying low wages for long hours that it is the H-2A worker protections they don't like, or is the program really too cumbersome? One reason to be skeptical of farmers claims of not enough workers is that there has seldom been a time when they had enough workers, at least from their point of view.""

Camarota questions the claim of a labor shortage because he says if that was the case, wages would be rising more rapidly.

We asked Rubio to explain his claim, since there is a legal system for at least some farmers to bring in foreign workers.

A spokeswoman pointed us to the data showing the small number of farm workers who get the H-2A visa. She also cited a report done for the Migration Policy Institute which raised concerns about the future supply of farm labor and noted the bureaucratic hassles in the H-2A process.

While farm owners complain the visa program is ""broken and bureaucratic,"" the paper stated, some worker advocates say that farmers are bypassing U.S. workers.

Our ruling

Rubio said the United States does ""not have a system through which growers and dairies can bring a workforce legally into the U.S.""

There actually is a system for growers to legally hire foreign workers, so Rubio is wrong on this basic point. 
However, many farmers have complained that the visa program is inadequate, cumbersome and in dire need of a makeover. Also, the H-2A visa program is only for temporary seasonal labor. Rubio specifically mentioned dairies, and that is a type of farm that needs year-round workers.

"['Criminal Justice', 'Legal Issues', 'Supreme Court', 'Wisconsin', 'Ed  Fallone']","
Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Ed Fallone says court deciding fewer cases
","
One argument Ed Fallone makes in running for the Wisconsin Supreme Court is that if he defeats Justice Pat Roggensack, he would stabilize a court he regards as dysfunctional. 
""Incivility,"" the Marquette University law professor said Feb. 5, 2013, on Wisconsin Public Radio, ""has led to reduced productivity; they’re deciding fewer opinions in civil and criminal cases than they used to."" 
In this context, it's impossible to define incivility, although there have been highly publicized incidents of conflict among the justices. And whether incivility affects the court's productivity is a matter of opinion. 
We can, however, test Fallone's claim that the court is deciding fewer cases. 
Disorder in the court 
Perhaps most Wisconsin voters planning to vote in the Feb. 19, 2013, primary for the Supreme Court (attorney Vince Megna is the third candidate) don’t follow the court’s inner workings. But it was hard to ignore headlines in June 2011 that revealed that Justice Ann Walsh Bradley had accused Justice David Prosser of putting his hands around her neck. 
Other witnesses said Bradley came at Prosser with fists raised and he put up his hands to block her or push her back.
The June 2011 confrontation came during a discussion on the day before the high court released a 4-3 decision upholding Gov. Scott Walker's highly controversial bill to curtail the collective bargaining rights of public employees. A special prosecutor investigated the incident and decided not to file any criminal charges. 
On Feb. 13, 2013, news surfaced that Bradley had received stepped-up security from law enforcement more than two months before the incident.) 
Rancor on the court had already been an issue. In March 2011, it was revealed that 13 months earlier, Prosser called Chief Justice Shirley Abrahamson a ""bitch"" and threatened to ""destroy"" her. And in June 2010, the justices deadlocked 3-3 on whether Justice Michael Gableman violated judicial ethics with an attack ad he used in 2008 against his Supreme Court opponent. 
Roggensack was elected in April 2003 to a 10-year term on the court. That's an important time element in evaluating Fallone's claim, given that he contends that if he replaced Roggensack, relations among the justices would improve. 
State statistics 
State court information officer Tom Sheehan told us the most readily available statistics on opinions issued by the Supreme Court cover six terms -- 2006-2007 through 2011-2012. New terms, for purposes of deciding cases, start each September. 
We found that the court has issued an average of 65 opinions in civil and criminal cases per year during that span: 
Term         '06-07    '07-08    '08-09    '09-10    '10-11    '11-12
Civil                47        49          43             40          44          42
Criminal         17        25          21             23          18          20
Total               64        74          64             63          62          62 
So, in five of the past six terms, which cover the majority of the time Roggensack has served on the Supreme Court, the number of opinions issued has not dropped off but rather stayed within a narrow range. 
Indeed, the court issued virtually the same number of civil and criminal case opinions in the term after the Prosser-Bradley incident (2011-2012) as it did in each of the three previous terms. 
Fallone's figures 
Fallone told us that attorneys who have appeared before the state Supreme Court believe tensions among the justices rose notably in 2008 during Gableman’s run for the court. 
That’s inconsistent with when Fallone said the drop-off in opinions occurred -- following the court’s 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 terms. 
But let’s take a look. 
Fallone cited a report that indicates that from January through August of 2005 -- in other words, the latter part of the 2004-2005 term -- the Supreme Court issued 129 opinions. (Fallone spokesman Nathan Schwantes said Fallone focused on the January-through-August period because that's when the vast majority of opinions are issued during a term.) Fallone also cited a report that indicates that from January through August of 2006, the latter part of the 2005-2006 term, 98 opinions were issued. 
Both figures are considerably higher than the figures we listed above for the six most recent terms. But Fallone is mixing apples and oranges -- and ending up with an overcount. 
Sheehan, the state courts spokesman, told us that older reports, such as the two Fallone cited, combine civil and criminal opinions with opinions issued in attorney discipline cases, thus producing a higher total number of opinions. Reports in more recent years, he said, break out tallies for opinions issued in the three types of cases. 
Fallone also said his own ""hard count"" of opinions issued in 2004-2005 and 2005-2006 indicate there were more than 100 opinions issued in civil and criminal cases in each term. But even if he were correct, that would indicate the number of opinions issued dropped off before 2008, which is when Fallone says tensions among the justices spiked upward. 
Going back further 
Fallone also cited a 2010 article in the magazine of the Wisconsin Public Research Institute, a conservative think tank, which argued that discord among the justices led to reduced productivity. The article said the state Supreme Court was issuing fewer opinions than it had in ""decades,"" but the statistics it cited lumped attorney discipline cases in with civil and criminal cases that were decided by opinion. 
We examined annual reports from the court dating to 1992, hoping to gather two decades’ worth of data, but there were two problems. Reports issued before 2006-2007 did not provide separate statistics for opinions issued in civil and criminal cases -- the opinions in attorney discipline cases were included in the totals. Moreover, the tallies were on a calendar-year basis, rather than following the September-through-August Supreme Court terms, like the newer reports do. 
Our rating 
Citing incivility on the Supreme Court in the past several years, Fallone said the court's justices are ""deciding fewer opinions in civil and criminal cases than they used to."" 
But he doesn’t provide evidence to establish that. Official figures show the number has been steady in the six most recent Supreme Court terms, which dates to when Fallone suggests that tensions on the court were high.

"['State Budget', 'Transportation', 'Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Grover Norquist']","
Norquist says Virginia has spent less than 1 percent of budget surpluses on roads
","
Grover Norquist, one of the most influential voices in the United States against raising taxes, is opposed to Gov. Bob McDonnell’s transportation plan.

McDonnell’s proposal to generate $3.2 billion over five years relies, in part, on ending the state’s fixed 17.5-cent per gallon gas tax and increasing the 5 percent sales tax to 5.8 percent. The plan also would raise the annual $41 registration fee for most vehicles to $56.

Norquist, who is president of the Americans for Tax Reform, says those two parts of McDonnell’s plan qualify as tax increases. He has warned the 30 Republican state legislators who have signed his organization’s pledge to oppose tax increases that support of McDonnell’s plan would break their promise.

Norquist says Virginia should find a way to fix its roads without raising taxes. One way to do that, he said during a Feb. 7 radio interview, would be to earmark the state’s budget surpluses for transportation.

""There’s been over $1 billion in surplus over the last three years, the legislature has spent less than 1 percent of that on roads,"" Norquist said on the John Fredericks Show.  ""So if you can’t prioritize unexpected revenue because the economy grew faster than you were planning, when can you begin to prioritize roads?""

We wondered whether Virginia really has spent less than 1 percent of its surplus on roads during the last three years.

We contacted Paul Blair, a spokesman for Americans for Tax Reform. He said Norquist’s statement was based on press clippings and budget presentations the McDonnell administration made to the General Assembly during fiscal 2010, 2011 and 2012. The total surplus for three those years came to $1.4 billion.

Blair also cited administration figures for the amount of the surplus each year that went to transportation: $32.7 million in 2010; $67.2 million in 2011 surplus and $0 in 2012 surplus. That comes to a total of $99.9 million in surpluses that went to the state’s Transportation Trust Fund.

Blair acknowledged those figures mean that the amount that went to transportation is not less than 1 percent, as Norquist said. Less than 1 percent would mean less than $14 million of surplus went to transportation over the last three years.

""Initial information provided by members of the state legislature was incorrect. The actual amount spent on transportation projects is $99.9 million, roughly 7 percent of surplus funds,"" Blair wrote in an e-mail. ""The facts remain: when presented with the opportunity to designate more money to the Transportation Trust Fund from annual surpluses, the legislature generally designates the money to any and everything else.""

Blair declined to identify the legislators who he said provided the wrong information. He said 7 percent is still a low number, adding that a 2007 state law calls for ensuring that 67 percent of ""undesignated"" surpluses are required to go to transportation.

""To circumvent state law on the amount of money required to go to transportation from a surplus, the legislature ensures that the 67 percent of ‘remaining funds’ is very little,"" Blair said. ""In 2012, it was a whopping $0.""

We spoke with Neil Miller, Virginia’s deputy finance secretary, who confirmed $99.9 million has gone to the Transportation Trust Fund from the 2010 and 2011 surpluses and no money at all went there from the 2012 surplus.

About two-thirds of the sum -- $61.7 million -- was earmarked for the Virginia Transportation Infrastructure Bank, a state program that lends money to localities and private entities to help pay for road, rail, and other transportation projects.

About half of the three-year $1.4 billion surplus that McDonnell announced in August comes from revenues that exceeded estimates. Most of the rest comes from allocated money that was not spent.

Miller explained in an e-mail that various state laws mandate where much of the state surplus money has to go.

For example the state’s constitution requires that a portion of the surplus be deposited in the rainy day fund, used to cushion Virginia through lean budget cycles. The fund was drawn down during the Great Recession and received a combined $211 million from the 2011 and 2012 surpluses.

Virginia law also requires a portion goes to the state’s water quality improvement fund, which got $103.7 million of surplus money over the last three fiscal years. Another $47.7 million went into a reserve fund for disaster relief. The General Assembly often adds to the list by approving budgets that allocate in advance portions of surpluses that might occur for other priorities, such as a bonus paid to state employees last December.

There have been proposals over the years to boost the portion of surpluses that are funneled to transportation. In 2007, Republican’s unsuccessfully sought to reserve half of all future budget surpluses for road maintenance.

Democrats have opposed the efforts. One reason is that the surplus comes from the state’s general fund, which draws largely from income and sales taxes to pay for education, public safety and health programs. Transportation is primarily funded by a different set of revenues: federal grants and state taxes on gasoline, vehicle sales and licenses. Many Democrats have insisted that surpluses should be returned to general fund programs.

Democrats and some senate Republicans also have noted that the state does not always end its fiscal year in surplus, and argued that Virginia needs a long-term, dependable source of new revenues to solve its transportation problems.

A final note: The major parts of McDonnell’s transportation plan have been approved by the House. The Senate has passed a more ambitious plan that would generate $900 million a year by increasing the gas tax and pegging it to inflation, raising vehicle registration fees and empowering localities to impose a local sales tax for transportation projects.

House and Senate negotiators are trying to reach a compromise before the General Assembly’s scheduled adjournment on Feb. 23.

Our ruling

Norquist said the state legislature spent less than 1 percent of its surplus over the last three years on roads.

His organization acknowledges that number is wrong. The correct figure is 7 percent, a difference equaling at least $86 million. We rate Norquist’s statement False.",/factchecks/2013/feb/18/grover-norquist/norquist-says-virginia-has-spent-less-1-percent-bu/
