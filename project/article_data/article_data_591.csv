Obama regrets 2006 vote against raising the debt limit
","
""America has a debt problem and a failure of leadership. Americans deserve better. I therefore intend to oppose the effort to increase America’s debt limit."" 
-- Sen. Barack Obama, March 16, 2006

""Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we can't play around with this stuff. . . . (Raising the limit is) important for the country."" 
-- President Barack Obama, April 15, 2011

As elected officials continue to grapple with the federal budget, another important vote is coming up: The vote to increase the debt ceiling. 

The limit now stands at a mind-boggling $14.3 trillion, but U.S. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says it must be raised by May 16 to allow the government to keep up with its obligations. The Treasury can juggle accounts until July, but after that, options run out.

We should point out that a vote to increase the debt limit doesn't increase spending directly. The spending was already authorized by other legislation, and now the Treasury Department needs a formal signoff to keep issuing debt. Some analysts have compared it to writing the check to cover a credit card bill for things you already charged. 

Still, it's critical for the United States to keep paying its debts and experts say failure to do so could ultimately lead to chaos in the financial markets. The Obama administration has been pushing hard to have a debt limit vote approved, and the earlier the better. Officials say a drawn-out process could spook international financial markets. (See our story for a more in-depth discussion of the debt limit vote.)

The votes -- there have been 10 since 2001 -- are famous for political posturing, and President Barack Obama is no exception. Back in 2006, he joined with other Senate Democrats to vote against raising the debt limit, a measure supported by President George W. Bush. 

""The fact that we are here today to debate raising America's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure. It is a sign that the U.S. Government can't pay its own bills,"" Obama said. The Senate narrowly approved raising the limit along partisan lines, 52-48, with all Democrats opposed.

Typically, the party that controls the White House has had to take the difficult vote to raise the limit, while the other party was free to criticize. An analysis of the past 10 years of votes on the debt limit from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center shows the vote usually splits along partisan lines, with the president's party voting in support.

Back in January, the White House was asked about Obama's comments from 2006. Robert Gibbs, then the White House press secretary, said the outcome of the vote wasn't in doubt.

""The full faith and credit of our government and our economy was not in doubt, and the president used it to make a point about needing to get serious about fiscal discipline,"" Gibbs said. ""(But) the ultimate bottom line is we shouldn’t upset the notion of that full faith and credit. We shouldn’t, as some have rhetorically done leading up to this, suggest that a good way to deal with this is simply to not pass that extension.""

Obama directly addressed the matter on April 15, in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News. Here's their exchange:

Stephanopoulos: ""You've got to extend the debt limit by May. And your job is a lot tougher because of your vote in the Senate against extending the debt limit. When did you realize that vote was a mistake?""

Obama: ""I think that it's important to understand the vantage point of a senator versus the vantage point of a president. When you're a senator, traditionally what's happened is, this is always a lousy vote. Nobody likes to be tagged as having increased the debt limit - for the United States by a trillion dollars. As president, you start realizing, you know what, we, we can't play around with this stuff. This is the full faith and credit of the United States. And so that was just an example of a new senator making what is a political vote as opposed to doing what was important for the country. And I'm the first one to acknowledge it.""

Obama's not unique in using the debt ceiling vote for partisan posturing. But on the Flip-O-Meter, he still earns a Full Flop.","[(""\nCongressional Record,\xa0Remarks by Sen.

"['Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'JoAnne Kloppenburg']","
JoAnne Kloppenburg says anomalies were widespread during the state Supreme Court race
","
Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate JoAnne Kloppenburg declared victory on election night when preliminary, unofficial returns put her 204 votes ahead of Justice David Prosser.

Fifteen days later, she sought a statewide recount after the official county-by-county returns showed her trailing by more than 7,300 votes out of 1.5 million cast.

In explaining her decision, Kloppenburg told reporters that a recount may not get her over the top, but would shine a light on ""an election that right now seems to so many people to be suspect.""

She also went on the offensive, raising questions about the legitimacy of the vote count around the state.

""There are legitimate and widespread anomalies,"" said Kloppenburg, a state Justice Department attorney, ""and widespread questions about the conduct of this election, most visibly in Waukesha County, but also in counties around the state.""

The Waukesha County problems are well known: A vote-tallying glitch belatedly boosted Prosser’s total in the official count by almost 7,600. County Clerk Kathy Nickolaus, a Republican in a GOP stronghold, didn’t report her error for more than a day after the election.

Given the outrage over the Waukesha incident, Kloppenburg seems on solid ground suggesting that there are ""widespread questions"" about the election.

But are there ""widespread anomalies"" in the statewide count?

That’s a much different claim and one we can check.

In order to justify her claim, we think Kloppenburg has to show that numerous questionable situations remain that are ""irregular"" or ""abnormal"" -- a dictionary definition of ""anomalous.""

In addition to the Waukesha situation, Kloppenburg at the news conference cited an ""undervote"" in Milwaukee and Racine; ballot shortages and long lines in Fond du Lac and several other municipalities; and changes in the unofficial vote totals in Winnebago County.

Let’s take a look:

""Undervotes"": This is when a voter chooses not to vote in all the races listed on a ballot -- creating an ""undervote"" in one race compared with another. For instance, this year in the city of Milwaukee, the Milwaukee County executive’s race drew about 2,000 more votes than the Kloppenburg-Prosser race at the top of the ticket.

Kloppenburg campaign manager Melissa Mulliken said Racine and Milwaukee had an unusually high undervote rate in the statewide court race compared with local races there.

""You wonder why,"" Mulliken said. ""Did voting machines misread ballots?""

But in the city of Milwaukee, the 2011 court contest was not the largest court-race undervote in even the last three years. In 2008, when Michael Gableman defeated incumbent Louis Butler for the high court, the Scott Walker-Lena Taylor race for county executive drew 3,500 more votes.

A review going back further shows the court races sometimes draw more and sometimes less than other contests, depending on the competitiveness of the races involved.

In Racine, the Kloppenburg-Prosser race drew fewer votes than the Racine mayor’s race. It was about 150 votes short, or 1 percent.

That, too, has happened before: In 2009, Justice Shirley Abrahamson’s breeze to re-election drew substantially fewer votes than a special primary election for Racine mayor. But in 2008, the Gableman-Butler race drew just slightly more than a statewide referendum in Racine.

Not much of a pattern there.

Neil Albrecht, deputy director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, said undervoting is not really an anomaly.

""It’s more a reflection with people's comfort and familiarity with certain contests and the candidates,"" he said.

UW-Madison political scientist Barry Burden agreed.

""‘Dropoff’ is the term we use,"" said Burden, who studies election administration. ""It doesn’t surprise me at all. That’s reasonable to expect when you have a local race that is grabbing a lot of attention.""

(Local conditions played out the other way in another Democratic hotbed, Dane County. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s Craig Gilbert reported that 10,000 more people voted in the court race than in a county exec’s race that was not even close.)

Ballot shortages: The unusually high voter turnout in the high court race -- at least 14 points higher statewide than predicted -- fueled ballot shortages in various communities. Kloppenburg cited Fond du Lac County. State election officials ordered the clerk in the city of Fond du Lac to issue substitute ballots because of shortages, and the resulting lines at touchscreen machines and delays in voting.

Our research found other shortages in the counties of Eau Claire, Sheboygan and Winnebago. Together, they involved more than 2,000 votes on photocopied ballots that had to be hand counted.

How unusual is this? There are mixed views.

Burden said the use of photocopied ballots is fairly common but rarely noticed unless a race is close.

It’s common enough for the state to have a law that sets out the procedure for issuing substitute ballots when shortages occur, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the state’s Governmental Accountability Board.

One clerk, Lisa Freiberg of Fond du Lac County, said it was ""very unusual"" in her county to resort to copying paper ballots. Fond du Lac City Clerk Sue Strands, who orders ballots, agreed.

Strands said she considers her vote count solid. She said if there was an ""anomaly"" it was limited to four instances in which voters tried to put their copied ballot into voting machines. They jammed.

Kloppenburg’s campaign says the question is how such ballots were counted.

There is some concern about reliable counts of photocopied ballots, because they can’t be run through voting machines, election clerks say.
That necessitated some hand-counting on a busy election night.

Discrepancies in unofficial results: It’s clear the big Waukesha County vote tally error on election night was unusual. PolitiFact Wisconsin earlier examined a Nickolaus claim that errors in that part of the process are ""common."" We found that her error was extreme but not unprecedented, and we rated her claim Barely True.

It’s important to note that errors such as the Waukesha County tally and the 1,100-vote miscommunication in the unofficial tally from Winnebago County are reviewed -- and typically corrected -- in the official vote canvasses done by the counties.

That process -- plus a special state probe of Waukesha County -- is now complete and state officials say the Waukesha and Winnebago discrepancies have been cleared up.

So if that verification process is already done, does that leave Kloppenburg with much justification for including Waukesha on her problem list? She points out the state will do a deeper investigation of Nickolaus’ past work -- and that the preliminary state probe did find a handful of discrepancies in the county’s canvass of write-in votes.

So, has Kloppenburg supported her claim?

Her ""undervote"" claims do not hold up; they are not anomalous based on historical patterns. Errors in the unofficial tally were mostly routine and by now have likely been corrected by the standard post-election canvasses. Waukesha County’s situation was rare, but it is only one county, and the big discrepancy there has already been cleared up, according to state elections officials.

In Kloppenburg’s favor: Ballot shortages -- though not rare and not by themselves evidence of miscounts -- did happen in multiple areas and are by no means the norm. And the Waukesha County situation, while already investigated at length, still has a few loose ends, and questions remain about Nickolaus’ methods.

So, Kloppenburg’s claim had an element of truth but skipped critical facts that would give a different impression. Some might call it mostly false. But on the Truth-O-Meter, that’s the definition of Barely True.","[('\nJoAnne Kloppenburg, remarks at news conference, April 20, 2011\n\nInterview with Barry Burden, UW-Madison political scientist, April 26, 2011\n\nInterview with Sheboygan County Clerk Julie Glancey, April 26, 2011\n\nInterview with Waupun City Clerk Angie Hull, April 26, 2011\n\nInterview with Winnebago County Clerk Sue Ertmer, April 26, 2011\n\nInterviews with Milwaukee Election Commission deputy director Neil Albrecht, April 25-26, 2011\n\nInterview with Racine assistant city clerk Donna Deuster, April 25, 2011\n\nInterview with Diane Hermann-Brown, president of the Wisconsin Municipal Clerks Association, April 26, 2011\n\nInterview with Janet Geisler, president, Wisconsin County Clerks Association, April 26, 2011\n\nEmail interviews with Reid Magney, spokesperson, Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, April 25-26\n\nInterview with Melissa Mulliken, campaign manager for JoAnne Kloppenburg, April 25, 2011\n\nEmail interviews with Brian Nemoir, campaign manager for David Prosser, April 25-26\n\nVoice mail Interview with Eau Claire City Clerk Donna Austad, April 28, 2011\n\nInterview with Racine County Clerk Wendy Christensen, April 26, 2011\n\nInterview with Suzette Emmer, deputy administrator, Milwaukee County Election Commission, April 25, 2011\n\nInterview with Fond du Lac County Clerk Lisa Freiberg, April 26, 2011\n\nInterview with Fond du Lac City Clerk Sue Strands, April 26, 2011', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3zf6Uoj_m8')]",/factchecks/2011/apr/29/joanne-kloppenburg/joanne-kloppenburg-says-anomalies-were-widespread-/

Pro-gambling group says Texans annually gamble $2.5 billion in three neighboring states
","
An online banner ad on the Austin American-Statesman’s website April 19 made us eager to try our luck.

""Thank you Texas,"" says a color postcard featuring slot machines and addressed to the state of Texas. The ad, sponsored by a group that seeks to legalize slot machines in Texas, features three messages -- New Mexico thanking Texas for ""your"" $27 million and Louisiana and Oklahoma each offering thanks for ""your"" $1 billion.

Text below the postcards states: ""Texans spend $2.5 billion gambling in our neighboring states every year.""

That’s a lot of quarters. Is it right?

We asked Texans for Economic Development, the ad’s sponsor, for elaboration. The group, consisting of horse racing interests, wants Texas lawmakers to ask voters to permit slot machines at 13 in-state horse and greyhound tracks and three Indian reservations.

Its spokesman, Mike Lavigne, passed along a July 7, 2010, report prepared for the group by TXP, an Austin economic policy consulting group, stating that in 2009, Texans spent $2.7 billion on gaming and related activities in nearby states.

The report says Texans gambled most of that -- $2.57 billion -- immediate neighbors-with-casinos: Oklahoma, where the report says Texans threw down nearly $1.2 billion; Louisiana, about $1.1 billion; and New Mexico, $27 million. The state-by-state figures were based on various sources ""including state gaming commissions, primary field research, convention and visitors bureaus ... and other academic studies,"" the report says.

We wondered where those figures originated.

Casinos would be ideal sources for how much Texans plunk down across state lines, but we found no evidence they talk about their customer base. Hence, Alan Meister, who analyzes gaming issues for an Arlington, Va., consulting firm, advised us that certain ""assumptions have to be made"" to estimate the dollars gambled by residents of various states.

In an interview, Jon Hockenyos,TXP’s president, explained that the firm had to mesh different data ""to get the right order of magnitude"" for how much Texans were gambling. ""It’s like making fruit salad,"" he said.

The firm’s recipe, according to Hockenyos:

--In Oklahoma, researchers counted Texas license plates at a range of tribal gambling venues, finding Texas plates accounted for 90 percent of the vehicles in a sampling from halls close to Texas; 47 percent of plates at a sampling of casinos farther away; and 6 percent of establishments farthest from Texas.

Using the number of slot machines at each hall, TXP concluded that Texans accounted for 37 percent of the casinos’ total reported gaming revenue in 2009, which TXP estimated at $3.2 billion based on a national Indian gaming report. Hockenyos also noted a March 9 news article in The Tulsa World, quoting a study by Meister, that said tribal gaming revenue in Oklahoma for 2009 was $3.1 billion. The estimated piece of the Oklahoma gambling action credited to Texans: $1.18 billion.

--For Louisiana, TXP zeroed in on a 2009-10 report by the state on the economic impact of Louisiana’s riverboat casino industry. It said 62 percent of the casinos’ visitors came from another state or more than 150 miles away. TXP, mindful that Texans accounted for 70 percent of the combined 2008 populations of Texas, Louisiana, Arkansas and Mississippi, extrapolated from those percentages to estimate the Texans’ share of the far-away visitors -- 43 percent -- and multiplied that percentage by the state-reported 2009 gambling revenue, about $2.5 billion.

Wade Duty, executive director of the Louisiana Casino Association, forwarded what he described as a yet-to-be published January survey result indicating that 49 percent of riverboat casino customers hail from other states or more than 150 miles away. Informed of the lower figure, Texans for Economic Development reduced its estimate of the money Texans gamble in Louisiana from $1.1 billion to $869 million.

Duty said he’s not sure about the assumption that Texans comprised 70 percent of those out-of-state and long-distance gamblers. The Harvey Canal, site of a New Orleans riverboat casino, may be beautiful, he said, but ""people aren’t spending 16 hours in a car to come from Midland."" Duty called TXP’s revised estimate for how much Texans’ gambled ""more reasonable,"" but said: ""I can’t say it’s correct.""

Duty said a better way of estimating Texans’ expenditures would start with interviews of gambling patrons to gauge where they came from, how long they’d stayed and what they’d gambled.

--For New Mexico, TXP concluded that Texans over all accounted for about 8 percent of the money gambled in casinos and racinos, which are race tracks with slot machines. Hockenyos noted that nearly 4,000 slot machines -- a little less than one third of all the slot machines in the state -- are in southern New Mexico, near El Paso. El Paso’s population accounts for more than 65 percent of the residents of that southern sector, Hockenyos said, and Texans account for more than 20 percent of New Mexico’s annual visitors.

TXP applied the Texans’ 8 percent to what it then believed to be relevant gaming spending of nearly $350 million, making the Texans’ share $27 million. However, Hockenyos said, he later realized he’d inappropriately folded in licensing fees and also under-counted the year’s gambling expenditures, which were $968 million, according to records posted online by the New Mexico Gaming Control Board. The revised Texans’ portion? About $77 million.

So, with the firm’s latest tweaks, the three-state estimate is closer to $2.1 billion.

Everyone aboard with that?

Well, no. Stephen Reeves, a spokesman for the anti-gambling, Baptist-backed Christian Life Commission, said counting license plates is a poor way of gauging how much Texans spend in casinos. He followed up by email: ""However, if doing so I would suggest that the frequency that a particular car shows up must be taken into account to determine how much money they are ‘spending.’""

Our take: The fruit-salad methodology used by the consulting group was not perfect. Absent precise data, though, TXP’s estimate of how much money Texans gamble in neighboring states looks reasonable, though it’s a stretch to claim Texans gamble the same total amount every year.

We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('\nLouisiana Gaming Control Board, report, ""Report to the Louisiana State Legislature, 2009-10,"" undated, and ""Louisiana Riverboat Casino Industry, Economic Impact Figures FY 2009-10"" (received from Louisiana Casino Association)\n\nNational Indian Gaming Commission, report, ""2009 Indian Gaming Revenues,"" Texas Gaming Association, web page, ""Texans Are Paying to Improve Other States"" 2011\n\nTelephone interviews, Wade Duty, executive director, Louisiana Casino Association, April 26 and 27, 2011\n\nTelephone interviews, Jon Hockenyos, president, TXP Inc., Austin, April 19 and 25-27, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Alan Meister, principal economist, Nathan Associates Inc., April 22, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Stephen Reeves, Legislative Counsel, Christian Life Commission, Austin, April 19, 2011\n\nTelephone interview, Mike Stauffer, communications director, New Mexico Tourism Department, Santa Fe, April 26, 2011\n\nTexans for Economic Development, online advertisement, ""Thank You Texas,"" as seen April 19, 2011; press release, ""Updated Study Shows Texas Has Billions To Gain From Racetrack Gaming,"" \xa0and related study, ""The Economic and Tax Revenue Impact of Slot Machines at Racetracks in Texas,"" July 7, 2010\n\nThe Tulsa World, news article, ""Casino boom puts Sooner state at No. 4 for gaming revenue,"" March 9, 2011', 'http://lgcb.dps.louisiana.gov/docs/2009-2010%20Annual%20Report.pdf')]",/factchecks/2011/apr/29/texans-economic-development/pro-gambling-group-says-texans-annually-gamble-25-/

Victoria Taft warns of $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag, raises specter of bag police
","
On Monday, talk-radio host and conservative Victoria Taft sent two tweets regarding a proposed plastic bag ban pending in Salem. The first: ""$250 fine for possession of plastic bag if ban goes thru."" The second: ""‘Plastic’ Bag Ban: A $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store. Plastic bag police anyone?#5vtshow.""
PolitiFact Oregon knows that under proposed legislation there would be a 5-cent charge for each paper bag. But a $250 fine for mere possession of a bag? A plastic bag police? Those were intriguing concepts.

Taft has received one Pants on Fire and one False from PolitiFact Oregon, so we understand her reluctance to talk to us about her tweets. (Her email response to our query asked more questions than it answered.) That said, we did some checking and found that the $250 fine is rooted in reality: It’s the penalty levied on a retailer -- not a shopper -- for continuing to hand out single-use plastic bags at checkout.

Palmer Mason, a legislative analyst with the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality, said if the ban becomes law, the agency likely would use the first year not to fine, but to educate retailers on a new bag ban.

""This is a huge behavioral change.This affects most of the retail transactions in the state of Oregon and it will take time for consumers and retailers and for the industry to change their behavior and change what they’ve been doing for many years,"" he said.

(That said, Mason wants retailers to know that DEQ isn’t afraid to ticket flagrant flouters in year one.)

To be absolutely fair to Taft, the original language of Senate Bill 536 states that DEQ ""may impose a civil penalty on a person"" who violates Section 2 -- but again, Section 2 applies to retailers and what the establishments may or may not provide in terms of checkout bags. And, an amendment dated March 3, way before she tweeted, clarifies the original bill to strike out the words ""a person"" and replace the term with ""a retail establishment.""

Taft is right when she says there is a $250 fine for plastic bag abuse. But her second tweet, which  reads in part -- ""a $250 fine if you're caught with a plastic bag coming out of a store"" -- gives the impression that the individual shopper would be fined for possessing a plastic bag. And that’s just not true.

We would give Taft’s tweet a Pants on Fire if she had plucked the amount of the fine out of thin air. We could give this a Barely True, in that the statement contained an element of truth -- the $250 fine -- but failed to mention that it applied to retailers, which would have given a different impression.

But instead, we rate her statement a False. A shopper who is ""caught with a plastic bag"" does not merit a fine, and indeed, it may not even merit the retailer a fine since shoppers are allowed to bring in their own bags. DEQ officials will not be prowling supermarket exits to pounce on single-use plastic bag users. The statement is not accurate.

Obama: U.S. has more agents than ever patrolling borders
","
President Barack Obama offered a defense of his administration’s immigration policies in response to a question about the controversial bill recently passed by Georgia lawmakers to catch illegal immigrants.

""We have now more Border Patrol officers … than we’ve had at any time in our history,"" Obama told Channel 2 Action News anchor Justin Farmer.

The president’s claim seemed counter to criticism from some Georgia lawmakers and activists who say the federal government has done little to stop people from illegally crossing the U.S. borders and discourage employers from hiring illegal immigrants. We decided to check out Obama’s claim.

Homeland Security spokesman Steven Cribby told us there are currently 20,745 Border Patrol agents. Nearly 85 percent of them patrol the U.S.-Mexico border. The rest patrol the U.S.-Canada border. Cribby said there were 17,499 agents by the end of September 2008, nearly four months before Obama took office.

A decade earlier, in 2001, there were about 9,000 Border Patrol officers, according to a March 2010 report compiled for Congress by the U.S. Congressional Research Service. In 1992, the earliest year mentioned in the report, there were 3,555 agents along the Southwest border. About 300 agents patrolled the northern border in 1992.

An official with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports stricter illegal immigration guidelines, did not dispute the federal data. But the official said Obama shouldn’t gloat.

""The Border Patrol has been growing significantly under Obama as well as [under former President George W.] Bush,"" said Jack Martin, special projects director for FAIR. ""So he can take credit for it – but not all of the credit. The big stimulus was a focus on controlling the border in the wake of the 9/11 attacks.""

The congressional report supports Martin’s point. The number of agents nearly doubled during Bush’s presidency. However, the average annual increase of Border Patrol agents since Obama took office is about the same as Bush.

Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy for the Center for American Progress, said the toughest critics on immigration policy ""continue to move the goal post"" on the issue because it is easier to say the border patrol process is faulty rather than what he said are the more complex issues concerning illegal immigration. The Center for American Progress is an organization that has pushed for the federal government to help illegal immigrants to pay taxes and earn legal status in the U.S.

Fitz said the president’s claim is ""accurate,"" but noted there may have been times where there have been more agents at the Southwest border. He pointed to 1954, when an estimated 750,000 illegal immigrants left the United States to avoid a border crackdown. Experts say there were probably only about 750 agents leading the roundup.   

Our colleagues at the national PolitiFact site tackled a similar claim by the president in July 2010 when he said the U.S. had more Border Patrol agents along the Mexican border ""than at any time in our history."" They took into account the Mexican Expedition during the early 20th century before making their ruling. PolitiFact noted that President Woodrow Wilson sent between 75,000 and 150,000 troops to the U.S.-Mexico border in 1916 to quell a surprise attack in the New Mexico town of Columbus.

Here’s a portion of what prompted them to give Obama a Mostly True ruling: ""We do have more agents than anytime since the early 1990s. But there have been times in our history when the U.S. sent troops to the border, and many more people than are there to guard the border today.""

Federal data shows the number of agents patrolling America’s borders has increased to its highest levels in the last two decades. There is historical data that shows there has been at least one period in American history in which there were many more authorities patrolling the border. Because of that, we rate the president’s claim as Mostly True.","[('\nChannel 2 Action News, ""Obama to WSB-TV: No silver bullet for gas prices,"" April 27, 2011\n\nE-mail from Homeland Security Department spokesman Steven Cribby, April 27, 2011\n\nE-mail from Jack Martin, special projects director, Federation for American Immigration Reform, April 27, 2011\n\nPolitiFact, ""U.S. has more Border Patrol agents on the border of Mexico than ever, but debate goes on,"" July 2, 2010\n\nTelephone interview with Marshall Fitz, director of immigration policy, Center for American Progress, April 27, 2011\n\nU.S. Congressional Research Service, ""Border Security: The Role of the U.S. Border Patrol,"" March 3, 2010', 'http://www.wsbtv.com/news/27677794/detail.html')]",/factchecks/2011/apr/29/barack-obama/obama-says-us-has-more-agents-ever-borders/

Rep. Dennis Kucinich says Bush tax cuts caused a substantial part of the deficit
","
Cutting spending to reduce the deficit has been the focus of budget talks since Congress convened in January.

Doubts that President Obama and House Republicans can do it by reconciling their deficit-cutting plans led the ratings agency Standard and Poor’s to lower its outlook on the United States from ""stable"" to ""negative."" It led S&P to warn that the U.S. could lose its coveted status as the world’s most secure economy if lawmakers don’t agree to bring spending in line with revenue.

The GOP plan, approved by the House, would lower taxes on corporations and the wealthiest Americans and draw the bulk of its savings from cutting federal health care programs.

Obama's plan would raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and reduce military and domestic spending.

House Speaker John Boehner answered it by declaring tax increases ""a non-starter.""

""We don’t have deficits because Americans are taxed too little, we have deficits because Washington spends too much,"" said the Republican from West Chester in Southwest Ohio.

From both the other end of state and the political spectrum, Rep. Dennis Kucinich also said he was unsatisfied by the president's plan. But the Cleveland Democrat said he favored Obama's intention to end the so-called Bush tax cuts for the wealthy.

The tax cuts, he said, ""helped to create a substantial part of the deficit.""

Boehner's comment about too much spending was a statement of opinion. PolitiFact Ohio can't rate it. But we can look at Kucinich's claim about the tax cuts, which runs contrary to assertions that tax cuts pay for themselves.

The Bush tax cuts refer to two pieces of legislation -- the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003 -- that were enacted under President George W. Bush and written to expire at the end of 2010. They were extended for two years in December.

The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service examined them in ""The Bush Tax Cuts and the Economy,"" a report issued last December, and in an earlier study of budget deficits and major legislation.

Back in 2001, CRS said, the Congressional Budget Office projected gradually rising federal budget surpluses for the next decade. The tax cuts helped alter the outlook ""dramatically,"" and the budget in 2002 recorded a deficit for the first time since 1997.

""The Bush tax cuts, with a $1 trillion 10-year price tag, contributed to this shift from budget surpluses to deficits,"" CRS said. Other contributors included the 2001 recession, the increase in defense spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the Medicare prescription drug benefit.

But the tax cuts ""generated the largest 10-year increases in budget deficits,"" CRS said.

Estimates by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and the Joint Committee on Taxation put the total cost for the tax cuts (including the Working Families Tax Relief Act of 2004) at more than the amount allocated to the Defense Department for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

""This means that even with the spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the federal budget would have been in surplus in 2007 if the tax cuts had not been enacted, or if their costs had been offset,"" said a 2008 analysis from the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

The CBO last year projected a decrease in deficits if the tax cuts expired, and said extending all of them permanently would cost $3.3 trillion over 10 years and increase deficits.

PolitiFact has previously examined assertions that tax cuts increase revenues by stimulating economic growth. We found that the Congressional Budget Office, the Treasury Department, the Joint Committee on Taxation and the White House’s Council of Economic Advisers say that tax cuts lead to revenues that are lower than they otherwise would have been – even if they spur some economic growth.

""There's no clear relationship between taxes and economic growth,"" said Bob Williams of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""Too many factors complicate the picture to draw clear conclusions about the taxes-growth relationship.""

Our colleagues at FactCheck.org came to a similar conclusion.

Additionally, the Congressional Budget Office reported in March, ""Relative to the size of the economy, federal revenues are currently at their lowest level in 60 years.""

""There is no real dispute among economists that broad-based federal income tax cuts reduce revenue (except when tax rates are much higher than they are now),"" said Alan D. Viard of the conservative American Enterprise Institute. ""Revenue is lower than it would be without the Bush tax cuts -- liberal and conservative economists are in accord on this question.""

Debate will go on about the effectiveness of tax cuts in stimulating growth. We won't enter it. But analysis backs up Kucinich in saying that the Bush cuts ""helped to create a substantial part of the deficit.""

"['National', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'Obama Birth Certificate', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama says birth certificate drowned out budget proposals in media coverage
","
On the day he released copies of his long-form birth certificate, President Barack Obama said he was motivated to provide the document because he wanted to make sure that substantive issues, not sideshows, remained at the top of the news. 
Obama said that ""two weeks ago, when the Republican House had put forward a budget that will have huge consequences potentially to the country, and when I gave a speech about my budget and how I felt that we needed to invest in education and infrastructure and making sure that we had a strong safety net for our seniors even as we were closing the deficit -- during that entire week the dominant news story wasn’t about these huge, monumental choices that we're going to have to make as a nation. It was about my birth certificate. And that was true on most of the news outlets that were represented here"" at this news conference.

Readers suggested that we look into the president’s contention that birth-certificate stories overshadowed stories on the Democratic and Republican budget plans. Other media organizations have also looked into the question.

Fact-checkers and pundits who examined it used data from the Project for Excellence in Journalism, a nonpartisan group that produces a weekly analysis by sampling news coverage in broadcast and cable TV, newspapers, radio and the Internet. PEJ calculates its numbers based on a rigorous methodology and its ongoing study offers some of the most detailed statistics on news coverage available.

For the week the president referenced -- April 11-17 -- PEJ found that the biggest topic of news coverage was the economy, with 39 percent of news coverage. Birth-certificate-related coverage accounted for a bit less than 4 percent, PEJ reported.

So, based on PEJ’s figures, Obama is way off. But just to be sure, we took a second look using a more targeted approach.

We called up transcripts for cable and broadcast television news coverage in the Nexis database and looked at three topics of coverage: stories involving the terms ""Obama"" and ""birth certificate"" or ""birther""; stories involving ""Paul Ryan,"" the architect of the GOP budget plan, and ""Medicare""; and stories involving ""Obama"" and ""budget speech."" These are not perfect measurements -- the Nexis database, while large, is not fully comprehensive, and some minor or irrelevant mentions probably crept into our data. In addition, we just looked at television coverage, not radio, print or Internet coverage, as PEJ does. But we think the results still illustrate trends about what the media covered:

For the week of April 11:

Stories mentioning the birth certificate issue: Cable news 66, broadcast news 12, total 78.
Paul Ryan and Medicare: Cable news 63, broadcast news 15, total 78.
Obama’s budget speech: Cable news 135, broadcast news 24, total 159.

So Obama is also wrong by our Nexis count. Coverage of his own speech was twice as common as birth-certificate coverage, while stories about the birth certificate and Ryan’s plan ran neck-and-neck -- hardly a ""dominant"" edge for the birth certificate issue, as Obama had indicated in his news conference.

Still, we wondered whether the president would have been right if he’d simply said ""last week"" -- that is, the week of April 18 -- rather than ""two weeks ago."" It turns out that using those parameters, Obama would have been right. Here are the numbers for that week:

Stories mentioning the birth certificate issue: Cable news 80, broadcast news 12, total 92.
Paul Ryan and Medicare: Cable news 21, broadcast news 4, total 25.
Obama’s budget speech: Cable news 37, broadcast news 3, total 40.

In other words, for the week of April 18, the birth certificate issue was almost four times as prominent as the Ryan plan and more than twice as prominent as Obama’s budget speech.

Indeed, our data shows that cable television attention to the birth certificate issue grew consistently over the course of March and April. Mentions on the three cable news networks -- CNN, Fox and MSNBC -- increased from week to week, from one during the week of March 14, to 16 the next week, then 26, 43, 66 and finally 80 during the week of April 18.

PEJ, for its part, found birth certificate coverage jumping media-wide during the week of April 18. That week, coverage of the 2012 campaign generally jumped dramatically -- especially on cable, where it accounted for 19 percent of airtime studied. Driving that, PEJ found, was coverage of Trump in particular, and within the Trump coverage, birth-certificate issues were a major theme.

""This is a classic case of selective perception,"" said S. Robert Lichter, director of the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University. ""The birth certificate issue seemed irrelevant and irritating to the president, so he noticed whenever he saw it raised. The budget issue seemed indispensable to him, so he took it for granted whenever he saw it covered. This is a malady that affects politicians and journalists alike -- not to mention humble political scientists.""

Obama said that during the week of April 11, ""the dominant news story wasn’t about these huge, monumental choices that we're going to have to make as a nation. It was about my birth certificate."" He would have been correct if he’d simply referred to coverage one week later. But his precise claim -- and he was clear about the timing --  is not accurate. According to both PEJ’s analysis and our own, the big, substantive issues of the economy and the Democratic and Republican budget plans received quite a bit more coverage than the birth certificate story did during the week Obama referenced. We rate his statement False.","[('\nWhite House, remarks by the president, April 27, 2011\n\nProject for Excellence in Journalism, ""PEJ News Coverage Index: April 11-17, 2011""\n\nProject for Excellence in Journalism, ""PEJ News Coverage Index: April 18-24, 2011""\n\nWashington Post, ""Donald Trump in New Hampshire amid ‘birther’ madness"" (Fact Checker column), April 27, 2011\n\nPoynter.org, ""Factchecking Obama: Birther controversy was 4% of newshole, not ‘dominant’ story,"" April 27, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with \xa0S.

"['Abortion', 'Florida', 'Richard Corcoran']","
Rep. Richard Corcoran says 90 percent of prenatal Down syndrome cases result in abortion
","
Editor's note: On Feb. 27, 2012, we rated a similar claim -- phrased slightly differently -- by presidential candidate Rick Santorum and ruled it Half True. To see that ruling, click here. 
The use of statistics dominated a daylong debate over six abortion bills in the Florida House of Representatives on April 27, 2011.

The bills, which passed the House and are being heard in the Senate, include a broader ban on third-term abortions, tighter requirements for notifying parents when a minor seeks an abortion, and a mandate that women be offered an opportunity to view and hear a description of ultrasound images before receiving an abortion. Another bill seeks to amend the state Constitution to prevent possible state funding of most abortion procedures.

Among all the stats used in nearly six hours of floor speeches, one stood out. It came from Republican Rep. Richard Corcoran of New Port Richey and caught the attention of the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates on Twitter.

The group posted a message that said Corcoran claimed that ""90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted.""

""PolitiFact anyone?"" the group asked.

We heard it, too, and spoke with Corcoran after the House adjourned. He said he found it in a couple of different places, including in a New York Times story. Corcoran's point was that we, as Americans, have to do more to try to prevent abortion.

But is he right about the high percentage of abortion in these cases?

Sure enough, we found the Times article Corcoran was referencing.

The article from 2007 discussed how effective prenatal testing to detect Down syndrome could reduce the number of children born with the genetic condition, and how parents of children with Down syndrome were trying to convince others not to abort fetuses that tested positive for the condition. The story included almost the same line that Corcoran used -- that ""about 90 percent of pregnant women who are given a Down syndrome diagnosis have chosen to have an abortion.""

The line was not sourced, meaning the story did not say specifically where it came from. However, the online version did include a link to an abstract of a medical study discussing abortion rates after a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. The study is from 1999 by the Psychology and Genetics Research Group at King's College in London. It compiled 20 other studies measuring abortion rates and concluded that, following a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome, 92 percent of women chose to have an abortion.

We searched and found other studies that show similar percentages.

A study from researchers at Wayne State University in Michigan examined the cases of 145 pregnancies with a prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome from 1988-97. The study found that 19 (13.1 percent) women chose continuation of the pregnancy, while 126 (86.9 percent) chose termination. Another study examined 131 prenatally diagnosed cases of Down syndrome in Hawaii from 1987-96. The study found that women in 110 of those cases (84 percent) chose to have their pregnancies terminated.

That's three different medical studies, all reaching similar conclusions. Similar statistics were referenced in two books we found about prenatal testing (here and here).

We asked the Guttmacher Institute, an independent research organization that analyzes data on population growth and reproductive health, if we should be aware of any other data. Spokeswoman Rebecca Wind said she didn't know of anything else.

That leaves us to rely on these studies, which have been cited by subsequent researchers.

Corcoran said that ""90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted."" Though the exact numbers vary slightly, the studies back him up. We rate this statement True.",[],/factchecks/2011/apr/28/richard-corcoran/rep-richard-corcoran-says-90-percent-prenatal-down/
"['Religion', 'Virginia', 'Gordon Robertson']","
Gordon Robertson says Obama was ""raised Muslim""
","
Now that President Obama has produced a U.S. birth certificate, it’s time to move on to more pressing issues. Was the president really raised as a Muslim?

Gordon Robertson, the chief executive officer of the Christian Broadcast Network in Virginia Beach, made just that statement in a recent interview with Newsmax.com. Robertson, the son of televangelist Pat Robertson, said this about the president’s religious background:

""He was raised Muslim, father Muslim, went through a Muslim school and went through all of that and has come out and said ‘I want to be a Christian,’"" Robertson said.

Rumors that Obama was brought up Muslim were extensively explored and debunked when he was running for president in 2007. But some perceptions linger.

Robertson brought up the president's religious background in the context of a broader statement on how Obama embraced Christianity after what Robertson said was a Muslim upbringing. That suggests Robertson sees this as a positive story of how the nation’s leader came to embrace Christianity over Islam.

We asked Chris Roslan, a spokesman for the Christian Broadcasting Network, where Robertson got his information about Obama.

Roslan sent us an e-mail with Robertson’s response.

The CBN executive cited a passage from Obama’s 2006 autobiography, ""The Audacity of Hope"" in which Obama noted he first went to a Catholic school and then to a predominantly Muslim school while living in Indonesia from ages 6 to 10. Robertson also pointed to an excerpt from a 2009 speech Obama made at Cairo University in which the president said his father came from a Kenyan family that includes generations of Muslims.

Robertson also said that Obama’s biological father was raised Muslim. None of what Robertson cited proves that Obama himself was ""raised Muslim,"" which implies the president was raised in the faith and actively practiced.

So what’s the story behind Obama’s religious background?

Some conservatives have argued that simply having Muslim ancestors means Obama himself was Muslim before embracing Christianity. The evangelical minister Franklin Graham made that argument in an Aug. 19, 2010 interview on CNN when he said the ""seed of Islam"" passes from the father to Obama.

An Aug. 26, 2010 a PolitiFact national article critiqued Graham’s comments, saying while it’s true Islam scholars say that in Muslim cultures children of Muslims are generally assumed to be Muslim themselves, what really makes one an adherent to Islam is their own beliefs and practices.

PolitiFact national also found that family accounts suggest Obama’s biological father, Barack Hussein Obama, Sr.  was an atheist who had little influence on his son because he and Obama’s mother split shortly after the president was born in 1961.

So was Obama ever a practicing Muslim in his early years?

His presidential campaign said he never was and that he was not raised in any religion. Various news articles and biographies -- including the president’s own writings -- indicate he had a secular upbringing.

Articles interviewing Obama’s neighbors while he was in Indonesia indicate he sometimes attended a mosque with his stepfather.

Some of the web commentary has focused on the fact that Obama was listed in his Catholic school records as a Muslim as evidence that was his faith while in Indonesia.

But a number of stories suggested he may have been listed as Muslim simply because Obama’s stepfather was Muslim, though press accounts suggest Lolo Soetoro was not particularly devout.

Officials at the predominantly Muslim school that Obama attended has said the public academy is open to people of all faiths. A March, 2007 story in the Chicago Tribune said that when Obama was attending 4th grade, Muslim children would spend two hours a week studying Islam while Christian children would spend that time studying Christianity.

Even the passage from ""Audacity of Hope"" that Robertson cited in his e-mail shows the president’s upbringing included some ambivalence towards religion.

""My mother was less concerned with me learning the catechism or puzzling out the meaning of the muezzin’s call to evening prayer than she was with whether I was properly learning my multiplication tables,"" Obama wrote.

The president has said he became a Christian in his 20s while a community organizer in Chicago.

To sum up:

Robertson said Obama was raised Muslim.

Obama’s own writings, independent biographies and news articles show he had a secular childhood. Sure, he went to an Indonesian school where most of the children were Muslim and there are accounts that he sometimes attended a mosque with his Islamic stepfather. But there is no evidence that the president was a practicing Muslim raised in the faith.

By saying Obama was raised Muslim, Robertson is repeating a debunked claim.

"['National', 'Deficit', 'Federal Budget', 'John Boehner']","
John Boehner says Obama “took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas""
","
During an interview with ABC News’ Jonathan Karl, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, had a blunt message for President Barack Obama on the deficit: ""Grow up."" 
Referring to the deficit commission chaired by former Republican Sen. Alan Simpson of Wyoming and former Democratic White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, Boehner said, ""While I didn’t agree with everything they did, there was a lot in their proposal that was worthy of consideration. And what did the president do? He took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas. Not one. Come on! It’s time to grow up and get serious about the problems that face our country.""

A reader asked us to check whether the White House has indeed ignored the recommendations of the very blue-ribbon panel it had established. So we looked at the commission’s final report, which was released in December 2010; the president’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal, which was released in February 2011; and a fact sheet released by the White House following Obama’s budget speech at George Washington University in April 2011.

We should begin by noting that the commission’s report offered no shortage of recommendations for the White House to choose from -- more than 70, in fact. Based on our analysis of these three documents, as well as our discussions with independent budget experts, we found many policies now advocated by Obama that had been included in the bipartisan commission’s final report. However, in many cases the White House proposal either differed in some of the details or lacked details entirely.

When we contacted Boehner’s office, a spokesman said that the fairest way to compare the proposals is to look at the president’s proposed budget, since that document includes greater detail than the fact sheet that accompanied the George Washington University speech, which is informally known as the ""framework."" Still, we think the framework has value, so we’ll evaluate them separately.

First are two recommendations by the commission that were included in the president’s budget proposal:

• Allow the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation to increase premiums. The PBGC is the federal agency that protects traditional defined-benefit pension payments for workers whose companies have failed. Both the commission and the White House agreed that PBGC premiums are lower than those charged by private-sector financial institutions and are too low to allow the agency to remain financially stable. Both proposals would allow the agency to raise premiums in order to shore up its financial position.

• Increase government authority and funding to reduce Medicare fraud. The president’s budget does this.

So these two items by themselves show Boehner is wrong to say that none of the commission’s recommendations were included.

Next, we’ll list six of the commission’s recommendations that were included in the president’s budget with slight differences. 
• Eliminate ""in-school subsidies"" for the federal student loan program. Both the commission and the president’s budget agree that this policy should be eliminated, though the president would do it only for graduate and professional student loans.

• End the reliance on deficit spending to fund the transportation trust fund. The main difference here is that Obama does not specifically advocate a 15-cent-per-gallon increase in the gas tax -- a key provision of the commission’s recommendation.

• Freeze pay for federal workers and Defense Department civilians. The commission recommended a three-year freeze; the president’s budget would do two years.

• Overhaul the medical malpractice system.  The commission advocated an ""aggressive"" set of changes to the medical malpractice system, such as imposing a statute of limitations for suits, creating specialized ""health courts,"" and allowing ""safe haven"" rules for providers who follow best practices of care. Obama’s budget is much less specific, saying only that the president ""encourages Republicans to work constructively with him on medical malpractice as part of an overall effort to restrain health costs.""

• Reform the corporate tax system. The president’s budget calls for simplification but does not go so far as to endorse the commission’s specific recommendation of a single corporate tax rate between 23 percent and 29 percent and changing how foreign income is taxed.

• Increase government efficiency. Both the commission and the president’s budget endorse the idea of reorganizing government to make it more efficient, but neither provides much detail.

Finally, the White House ""framework"" on deficit reduction refers very generally to seven of the commission’s recommendations. In several of these examples, the White House proposal offers less detail than the commission’s.

• Cut both security and non-security spending. The commission urged cutting both types of spending by equal percentages. In his fact sheet for the framework, Obama advocates cutting non-security spending to levels consistent with that of the commission, but his cuts to security-related spending are not as large as those proposed by the commission.

• Implement structural tax reform. The commission and Obama both agree with the principle of cutting marginal tax rates while eliminating loopholes. But while the commission recommended ""a small number of simpler, more targeted provisions that promote work, home ownership, health care, charity and savings,"" Obama was less specific.

• Reform Medicare’s Sustainable Growth Rate mechanism. Both the commission and Obama agreed that the Sustainable Growth Rate needs to be overhauled, in a way that is fully offset in the budget, but their approaches are somewhat different.

• Establish a long-term global budget for federal health care spending. The commission urged a ""target of holding growth (of all federal health care spending) to GDP plus 1 percent and requiring action by the president and Congress if growth exceeds the targets."" In his framework, Obama proposed a more aggressive standard -- GDP plus 0.5 percent per beneficiary -- but for the more limited target of just Medicare.

• Eliminate state ""gaming"" of Medicaid. The commission recommends preventing states from taxing providers in order to increase their payments, and therefore increase the federal match. The Obama framework backs a limited version.

• Reduce agricultural subsidies. The Obama framework supports cuts, but it does not mention the specific programs recommended by the commission.

• Create a mechanism to enforce adherence to debt stabilization. Both the commission and the president’s framework agree on this in principle, but they use different mechanisms. The commission recommended that if balanced-budget targets are not met, Congress would need to implement a fast-track legislative procedure to enforce changes in spending and/or taxes. The president would do something similar, but he would specifically carve out Social Security, low-income programs and Medicare, ""consistent with prior fiscal enforcement triggers put in place by Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Clinton.""

We do think it’s fair to say that Obama has stopped short of adopting many of the commission’s recommendations, and he’s been clear that he will not accept the package in its entirety.

But even if you look only at his fiscal year 2012 budget plan rather than the less detailed framework, Obama made two proposals --  pension guarantees and Medicare fraud -- that are substantially similar to those offered by the commission, and his budget proposal includes six additional provisions that share significant common ground with recommendations made by the commission.

Alice Rivlin, the former director of the Office of Management and Budget for Clinton and a member of the commission, told PolitiFact that the most important idea Obama took from the group wasn’t a policy proposal at all but was instead ""the concept of shared sacrifice,"" which was a centerpiece of the commission’s preamble.

If Boehner had offered a more measured assessment, he would have had a fair point about the differences between Obama’s fiscal approach and that outlined by the commission. The president certainly could have gone further in embracing the recommendations of the panel he had commissioned. But he did embrace a wide variety of them, so to say bluntly, as Boehner did, that Obama ""took exactly none of his own deficit reduction commission’s ideas"" is simply not correct. To one degree or another, the commission’s recommendations are sprinkled throughout Obama’s budget proposals, in recognizable -- if not always in identical -- form. So we rate Boehner’s statement False.","[('\nJohn Boehner, interview with ABC News, April 25, 2011\n\nNational Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, ""The Moment of Truth"" (final report of the commission), December 2010\n\nWhite House, president’s fiscal year 2012 budget proposal, accessed April 26, 2011\n\nWhite House, ""Fact Sheet: The President\'s Framework for Shared Prosperity and Shared Fiscal Responsibility,"" April 13, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Paul Van de Water, senior fellow with the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities, April 26, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Marc Goldwein, policy director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, April 26, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Alice Rivlin, former director of the Office of Management and Budget and a member of the Simpson-Bowles commission, April 26, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Michael Steel, spokesman for John Boehner, April 26, 2011', 'https://abcnews.go.com/wnt/video/boehner-gas-prices-cost-obama-election-13454075&tab=9482930&section=1206853&playlist=1363488'), ('\n\xa0', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2011/apr/28/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-obama-took-exactly-none-his-own-/

Vice President Joe Biden says more jobs were created in the last year than in all eight years under George Bush
","
Vice President Joe Biden loves campaigning in Ohio. He did so 15 times during the 2010 Midterm elections for various state and federal candidates. 
But Democrats still suffered a ""shellacking,"" he joked during an April 19 campaign fundraiser in Cleveland for U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, who faces re-election next year.

Citing positive economic news, Biden insisted, however, that the political debate about his administration’s policies now favors Democrats.

""A lot of things we took a shellacking for, the American public has had an opportunity to take a good look at now,"" he said.

Biden noted the improving unemployment rate. And he added this comparison: ""We have created more jobs in this last year than the Bush administration (did) in eight years. We are in a position where we are moving to toward creating an average of 220,000 jobs a month. Not enough, but we are moving.""

PolitiFact Ohio likes comparisons and decided to examine this one because it’s emerging as a key Democratic talking point. When checking out job figures, PolitiFact turns to The Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official score keeper of U.S. employment numbers.

The BLS numbers are based on monthly surveys of employers. It updates the monthly figure as employers complete their surveys and it incorporates into the monthly figure a more complete quarterly census of employment and wages.

First, we can quickly dispense with the Biden’s lead-in: That the unemployment rate is improving.

In March, the national unemployment rate dropped for the fourth consecutive month. At 8.8 percent, the rate is down from a recession peak of 10.1 in Oct. 2009, according to the BLS.

Also, we can dispense with the last part: ""We are moving to toward creating an average of 220,000 jobs a month. Not enough, but we are moving."" Since it’s not really a statement of fact and includes a prediction, we’ll leave that to be examined down the road.

But how about the Obama vs. Bush job comparison?

The number of jobs as of February 2001, the first full month of Bush’s presidency, was 132.53 million. The number of jobs as of January 2009, the month he left office, was 133.56 million. That’s a net gain 1.03 million jobs.

To checkout Biden’s claim, we looked back 12 months, from March 2010 to March of 2011. (Though Biden made remarks this month, April figures have not yet been tallied.)

The number of jobs in March 2010 was 129.43 million. The number of jobs in March 2011 is 130.73 million. The net gain during the last year is 1.3 million jobs.

That means 270,000 more jobs were created in the last 12 months than the net total of jobs at the end of Bush’s two terms.

A familiar detour, or caveat, is in order. Typically, the most recent BLS monthly job figures are preliminary and will change as surveys are completed and figures are updated. That means the 270,000 edge for the Obama administration could increase -- or disappear.

Politifact also frequently points that when framing job figures, slicing and timing make all the difference.

Republicans, for instance, like to frame the jobs story this way: The U.S. has lost a total of 2.09 million jobs since Obama’s first full-month in office in February 2009. That’s true. Of course, looking at this way shortchanges the impact of the deep recession Obama inherited and the recent economic growth.

Likewise, Democrats shortchange Bush when they ignore that the U.S. created more than 5.6 million jobs through January 2008, when the recession began to take hold.

The bottom line is that the recession, which officially began in Dec. 2007, hurt the job record of both presidents.

So where does that leave Biden’s statement?

He’s correct about the declining unemployment rate. He’s also accurate about the gains made in the last year. The figure also falls within the context that the recovery has been slow and painful but the job picture is improving of late, albeit slowly.

Understanding how he slices job numbers in his comparison is a point that provides clarification. On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate Biden’s statement as Mostly True.","[('\nVice President Joe Biden, speech in Cleveland, Ohio, April 19, 2011\n\nBureau of Labor Statistics, Employment figures', 'http://data.bls.gov/pdq/SurveyOutputServlet;jsessionid=3489E1DAD624AFE2A0726F94AFB9A2C8.tc_instance4;%20Unemployment%20rate,%20http://data.bls.gov/timeseries/LNS14000000')]",/factchecks/2011/apr/28/joe-biden/vice-president-joe-biden-says-there-were-more-new-/

Donald Trump says Kuwait never paid U.S. back for ousting Saddam Hussein
","
During an April 27, 2011, news conference in Portsmouth, N.H., Donald Trump -- the businessman and potential Republican presidential candidate -- was asked what he would do differently from President Barack Obama.

""What I would do differently is come down really hard on OPEC,"" Trump said, referring to the cartel of oil-producing states, including many in the Middle East, which are behind the recent rise in gasoline prices. ""If you look at these nations, they wouldn't be there except for us. You take a look at Kuwait. I mean, we handed Kuwait back to the people that right now essentially own Kuwait, because it's really ownership more than anything else. We handed it back. They never paid us.""

Trump was referring to the Persian Gulf War in 1991, when a U.S.-led military alliance drove Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait after the Iraqi dictator invaded the small, wealthy, oil-producing emirate.

Is it really true that Kuwait didn’t bother paying us back after we bailed them out? Not at all.

We turned to the final report on the war presented to Congress in 1992. According to the report, the U.S. was on the hook for the cost of more than 500,000 U.S. troops and associated equipment beyond what the military would have had to pay for ordinary, non-war activities. But rather than shouldering this burden alone, the administration of President George H.W. Bush secured financial pledges from fellow coalition members.

The report says that these war costs, known as ""incremental costs,"" were estimated to be $61 billion. In 1990 and 1991, coalition nations committed almost $54 billion to offset that cost -- roughly two-thirds from Persian Gulf states directly threatened by the invasion and one-third from other countries, largely Japan and Germany.

By March 11, 1992, the United States had received nearly all of the money that had been pledged. Here’s a breakdown, in descending order by pledge size, according to a report to Congress:

Saudi Arabia: $16.8 billion pledged, $12.0 billion paid in cash, $4.0 billion paid in kind. Total paid: $16.0 billion

Kuwait: $16.1 billion pledged, $16.015 billion paid in cash, $43 million paid in kind. Total paid: $16.1 billion

Japan: $10.0 billion pledged, $9.4 billion paid in cash, $571 million paid in kind. Total paid: $10.0 billion

Germany: $6.6 billion pledged, $5.8 billion paid in cash, $683 million paid in kind. Total paid: $6.5 billion

United Arab Emirates: $4.1 billion pledged, $3.9 billion paid in cash, $218 million paid in kind. Total paid: $4.1 billion

South Korea: $355 million pledged, $150 million paid in cash, $101 million paid in kind. Total paid: $251 million

Total reimbursements: $54 billion pledged, $47.3 billion paid in cash, $5.6 billion paid in kind. Total paid: $52.9 billion

A final accounting published a decade later by the House Budget Committee’s Democratic staff found that the final reimbursements eventually crept up slightly, to $54.1 billion. Of that, $48.4 billion was in cash, and $5.7 billion was in kind.

So Trump was flat wrong that Kuwait ""never paid us."" When the books were closed on the war, the United States found itself out of pocket by about $7 billion -- less than half of the $16 billion shelled out by the Kuwaitis. We rate his claim Pants on Fire!","[('\nDonald Trump, transcript of press conference in Portsmouth, N.H., April 27, 2011 (CQ subscribers only)\n\nDonald Trump, video of press conference in Portsmouth, N.H., April 27, 2011\n\nFinal Report to Congress: Conduct of the Persian Gulf War, April 1992\n\nHouse Budget Committee Democratic Caucus, ""Lindsey is in the Ball Park: A War on Iraq Could Cost $100 Billion to $200 Billion,"" September 23, 2002\n\nE-mail interview with Michael O’Hanlon, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, April 27, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Lance Janda, professor of history at Cameron University, April 27, 2011\n\nE-mail interview with Steven R.

"['Obama Birth Certificate', 'Texas', 'Leo Berman']","
State Rep. Leo Berman says Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children denies President Barack Obama was born there
","
Trying to quell recurrent unfounded claims that he wasn’t born in Hawaii, President Barack Obama released his long-form birth certificate Wednesday.

In a White House news conference, the president said he was releasing the document in order to move on from the so-called ""birther"" issue: ""We have to make a series of very difficult decisions about how we invest in our future but also get a hold of the deficit and debt. But we're not going to be able to do it if we are distracted. We're not going to be able to do it if we just make stuff up and pretend that facts are not facts.""

Nevertheless, Obama said, there will likely be ""a segment of people"" for whom the evidence of his birth certificate is not enough. Indeed, shortly after Obama spoke, state Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, said he’s still not persuaded that Obama was born in a Honolulu hospital, according to the Texas Tribune.

The Tribune reported that Berman, who has filed legislation to require presidential candidates who want to appear on the Texas ballot to present their birth certificate to the secretary of state, ""claims the hospital Obama lists on his birth certificate — in fact, all hospitals in Honolulu — have denied the president was born there.""

We followed up with Berman, who told us that two hospitals, including Kapiolani Medical Center For Women and Children, where Obama says he was born, have denied it. He couldn’t recall the name of the other hospital.  

Asked where and when the hospitals made the denials, Berman told us: ""In several places over the past year and a half,"" but provided no more specifics. ""Neither hospital recognized the fact that he was born there and not only that, but you would think that the hospital that gave birth to the president of the United States would have some kind of commemorative plaque or something.""

Berman also said that ""it’s going to take someone with a lot of money like Donald Trump to take a look at this and see if Kapiolani will admit whether or not he was born there.""

Trump, a possible GOP presidential candidate, has repeatedly suggested that Obama was not born in the United States. Earlier this month, for example, he said Obama’s ""grandmother in Kenya said he was born in Kenya and she was there and witnessed his birth."" PolitiFact rated that statement False. Responding to a 2008 question about whether ""she was present when he was born in Kenya,"" Obama’s grandmother, who speaks Swahili, at first said through a translator that she was. Then she clearly and repeatedly corrected herself, saying that he was born in the United States. 
A subset of Obama critics, dubbed ""birthers,"" doubt that he is a natural-born U.S. citizen, a requirement to serve as president. PolitiFact has checked at least five other claims about Obama’s birthplace, finding no truth to any of them. One was a February claim by Berman, who said Hawaii’s governor ""can’t find anything that says (Obama) was born in Hawaii."" Finding no evidence that the governor said that, we rated his claim False.

We searched the Lexis-Nexis database, which archives news articles, and the Internet, where skepticism about Obama’s proof of citizenship thrives, for assertions that Kapiolani hospital had ever denied that it was the site of Obama’s birth.

We found no instances of hospital officials making that assertion. However, we found a Jan. 18 story by World Net Daily, a conservative news website that has fanned the birth certificate controversy, reporting that a former Honolulu elections official had said that Kapiolani hospital has no record that Obama was born there.

Two days later, Hollywood reporter Mike Evans, claiming to be a longtime friend of Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercrombie’s, told Minnesota’s KQRS-FM radio that the governor had told him that he had searched ""everywhere using his powers as governor"" at Kapiolani and Queen’s hospitals and that ""there is no Barack Obama birth certificate in Hawaii. Absolutely no proof at all that he was born in Hawaii.""

However, FoxNews.com later quoted Evans as saying that he had misspoken. ""I haven’t talked to Neil since he’s been governor,"" he said. According to Fox, Evans said that he called Abercrombie’s office after reading online reports that the governor couldn’t find Obama’s birth certificate but Abercrombie did not return his call.

Obama’s newly-released long-form birth certificate contradicts those reports — and Berman’s claim. The document says that Barack Hussein Obama II was born at Kapiolani Maternity & Gynecological Hospital at 7:24 p.m. Aug. 4, 1961.

We attempted to reach officials from the Kapiolani Medical Center for Woman and Children on Wednesday and didn’t hear back. But as FactCheck.org reported in its April 9 look at Trump’s claims, Kapiolani can’t legally release individually identifiable health information, which the 1996 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) prohibits.

Individually identifiable health information, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, is information relating to the provision of health care to an individual, or anything that can reasonably be used to identify the individual, such as a name, address, birth date or Social Security number.

An individual’s health information can only be shared under certain circumstances, according to the site, such as reporting a gunshot wound to the police. Protected information includes information in an individual’s medical record, and health providers must comply with an individual’s right to decide whether or not health information can be shared for certain purposes.

In July 2009, World Net Daily quoted Kristy Watanabe, a spokeswoman at Hawaii Pacific Health, which includes the Kapiolani hospital, as saying: ""Our comment to everyone who has been calling is that federal law does not permit us to provide any more details concerning information about Obama’s birth without authorization from Mr. Obama.""

However, the medical center has promoted a January 2009 letter Obama wrote on White House stationery to congratulate the medical center on its centennial celebration. ""Kapiolani was one of Hawaii’s earliest hospitals, and it has served many generations of Hawaii’s people with distinction,"" the letter says. ""As a beneficiary of the excellence of Kapiolani Medical Center — the place of my birth — I am pleased to add my voice to your chorus of supporters.""

The Foundations of Hawaii Pacific Health published the letter in the spring 2009 issue of its Inspire magazine, and the medical center posted video of Abercrombie reading Obama’s letter at the centennial dinner on its website.

For CNN’s recent investigation into ""birther"" claims, which aired April 25-26, CNN reporter Gary Tuchman traveled to Hawaii to conduct numerous interviews, including one with Monika Danielson, who says she was in the hospital at the same time as Obama's mother and saw him in the nursery. He also interviewed Chiyome Fukino, who was the state Health Department's director under Republican Gov. Linda Lingle.

The bottom line, according to Tuchman: His research ""reveals what most analysts have been saying since the 'birther' controversy erupted during the 2008 presidential campaign: Obama was born in Hawaii on Aug. 4, 1961. Period.""

So far as we can tell, Kapiolani hasn’t confirmed that Obama was born there, citing federal privacy law that prevents it from doing so. But we found no record that the hospital has ever denied it, as Berman claims. Nor did the lawmaker provide evidence of such.

We have a rating for such statements.

The post said that White House chef Lisa Mead hasn’t cooked a single meal since Trump took office, instead being forced to ""retrieve Trump’s orders from drive-through windows and scoop the President’s ice cream from the carton."" Sources in the story described particular preparation methods Trump favored for his food, which people quoted in the story found difficult to stomach. The post described Trump eating only the skin and fat from Kentucky Fried Chicken and making Mead remove all the brown M&M’s from a McDonald’s McFlurry. While Trump has been known to favor Col.

Trump’s False claim that his presidential approval rating is ‘not bad’
","Six months into his presidency, Donald Trump is putting a positive spin on the latest round of public polling on his job performance. ""The ABC/Washington Post Poll, even though almost 40% is not bad at this time, was just about the most inaccurate poll around election time!"" Trump tweeted Sunday morning, July 16. The ABC News/Washington Post poll actually showed Trump’s approval rating at 36 percent — not almost 40 percent, as the president stated. We decided to fact-check Trump’s claim that his approval rating is ""not bad at this time"" by comparing his numbers to those of other presidents at the six-month mark. Since the middle of the 20th century, pollsters have been systematically tracking responses to the question: ""Do you approve or disapprove of the way (president’s name) is handling his job as president?"" As a result, a modern-day president’s performance can be tracked against that of historical predecessors as far back as Harry Truman. So what to make Trump’s claim that his six-month approval rating is ""not bad""? Before turning to that question, an important caveat is that a widely cited average of Trump approval rating polls by Real Clear Politics does show Trump’s rating hovering around 40 percent. But the focus of this fact-check is on the ABC News/Washington Post poll, because that’s the one Trump singled out in his tweet. According to Gallup and ABC News/Washington Post polling data, the average six-month presidential approval rating is around 62 percent — well above Trump’s approval rating of 36 percent. The results look even bleaker when Trump’s numbers are placed side-by-side with other presidents. According to data compiled by ABC News, Trump has the worst approval rating in the last seven decades compared to other presidents at roughly the same period in their presidency. The second worst approval rating is that of President Gerald Ford, at 39 percent. Trump’s net approval rating (percent approval minus disapproval) of -22 percent is also a historic low since presidential polling of this kind began. Only two other presidents — Bill Clinton and Ford — had negative net approval ratings at this point in their tenure. ""Politicians always want to claim they are doing well in the polls,"" said Karlyn Bowman, a polling expert at the American Enterprise Institute. ""But Donald Trump’s claim that his ratings are ‘not bad’ compared to other president’s doesn’t square with available historical data, which shows his approval rating below all presidents for whom we have data at this point in their presidencies."" Trump said his six-month approval poll numbers are ""not bad"" relative to other presidents at this point in his presidency. Not bad isn’t a scientific term, but by any sober measure Trump is performing relatively worse compared to his contemporaries, as well as any president since World War II. We rate his claim False.

Is U.S. liquefied natural gas a game-changer for Russia, Europe?
","When PolitiFact fact-checks an interview with the president, we usually train our Truth-O-Meter on the president’s answers. But during a recent televised sit-down between President Donald Trump and televangelist Pat Robertson on the Christian Broadcasting Network, a question by Robertson caught our attention. Robertson said Gazprom, a Russian natural-gas giant, ""held Europe by the throat -- they were a monopoly, and now the U.S. is breaking into that monopoly with our exports of LNG,"" or liquefied natural gas. Trump replied, ""We are. We have LNG exporting all over."" The normal way to transport natural gas is through pipelines, but pipelines aren’t considered economical for transoceanic shipments of natural gas. Liquefied natural gas, or LNG, has been cooled so that it can be shipped more efficiently as a liquid in specially designed cargo ships. Transporting natural gas this way requires specialized facilities at both ends of the voyage. (Here’s a more detailed explanation from the federal government.) Diagram: Government Accountability Office With that in mind, we wondered whether Robertson was accurately describing the current state of trade in natural gas between the United States, Europe, and Russia. We found that Robertson had a point, but one that was oversimplified. (A public-relations firm that represents the Christian Broadcasting Network, which was founded by Robertson, told PolitiFact that they had nothing to add to his comments during the interview.) We’ll break down Robertson’s claim into two pieces. Gazprom does indeed have a history of being used by the Russian government as a hardball tool of foreign policy. In 2008, during a dispute with Ukraine, Russia cut off gas supplies to Europe. Natural gas emerged as a possible conflict point again in 2014, after the Russian annexation of the Ukrainian region of Crimea. Threats by Russia are credible because certain European countries are heavily dependent on Russian natural gas. ""Russia supplies 100 percent, or close to 100 percent, of natural gas imports in some central eastern and southeastern European countries, including Estonia, Latvia, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Finland and, until recently, Lithuania,"" said Jason Bordoff, director of Columbia University’s Center on Global Energy Policy. This ""gives Russia some leverage,"" Bordoff said. ""Unlike oil, which can more easily and flexibly be moved from place to place, gas typically moves through pipeline, which makes buyer and seller more dependent."" That said, Robertson’s phrasing isn’t entirely accurate, experts told PolitiFact. Gazprom is a monopoly from the perspective of Russia, Bordoff said -- that is, it’s the only company allowed to export pipeline gas from Russia. But it is not a monopoly from the perspective of its European buyers, especially in the northwestern and southern portions of the continent, where energy portfolios are more diversified, said Tim Boersma, a senior scholar at Columbia’s Center on Global Energy Policy. ""Russia only supplies about one-third of Europe's gas, so Europe has plenty of other sources,"" Bordoff said. In many cases, he said, European countries buy Russian gas because it is cheaper -- not because it’s the only option. Meanwhile, much of Europe has options beyond natural gas. ""Natural gas competes with coal, oil, nuclear and renewables to various degrees across Europe,"" said Paul Sullivan, an energy-markets specialist affiliated with National Defense University and Georgetown University. ""Often, markets for energy sources can overlap, especially in the long run as relative prices change."" This is certainly an aspiration of the United States, which in recent years has begun tapping into large reserves of natural gas through hydraulic fracturing, or ""fracking."" Speaking at a press conference in Warsaw in advance of the recent G-20 summit meeting, Trump said, ""Let me be clear about one crucial point. The United States will never use energy to coerce your nations, and we cannot allow others to do so. You don't want to have a monopoly or a monopolistic situation."" And the United States’ aspiration is beginning to materialize, at least in a modest way. In June, one LNG shipment traveled from the United States to Poland, and another is expected to arrive in Lithuania later in the summer, Bordoff said. Both shipments were made possible because Poland and Lithuania have built new LNG terminals in recent years. ""In these two instances, Bordoff said, ""LNG from the United States competes more or less directly with Russian gas."" However, the U.S. footprint in European LNG markets is quite small. Currently, shipments to Europe represent a fraction of the United States’ LNG exports -- according to the most recent data, the top 10 buyers of American LNG are dominated by Latin American and Asian nations. In order, they are Mexico, Chile, Japan, China, Argentina, Jordan, India, Kuwait, South Korea, Turkey. In addition, a sizable chunk of the LNG sent by the United States to Europe goes to countries like Spain, Portugal and Italy -- places where American LNG is generally not displacing Russian natural gas. Spain and Portugal do not import Russian gas, and while Italy does, it has a more balanced portfolio, Bordoff said. Meanwhile, a variety of factors are expected to limit how much of a player United States LNG can eventually become in European markets. Here are some of them: • Infrastructure and price. The cooling and uncooling of LNG adds to the ultimate price of the fuel -- and it requires the construction of LNG-capable terminals. In addition to the LNG terminals in Poland and Lithuania, Croatia is expected to build one, but it probably won’t be operational until 2020, Bordoff said.   Pipelines used by Russia, by contrast, are already built and operating. ""American LNG may have some presence in Europe, but Russian gas will be always cheaper and more competitive,"" said Anna Mikulska, a fellow at Rice University’s Center for Energy Studies. And the United States is not exactly brimming with LNG export facilities, either. The only one located in the lower 48 states is Sabine Pass in Louisiana. Another one, in Alaska, is geared more toward Asian markets. (There are other terminals that take imports only.) ""We have a lot of LNG export facilities in the works, but so do the Australians and others,"" Sullivan said. ""Australia is focusing mostly on the Pacific and Asian markets, but it could break into other markets later."" • The United States is a latecomer to this market. Even within the universe of LNG exporters to Europe, other countries have a head start on the United States. The top natural gas suppliers to Europe -- via either pipelines or LNG -- are, in order, Russia, Norway, Algeria, Qatar, Nigeria, Azerbaijan, Libya, Trinidad & Tobago, and Peru. Even for Poland and Lithuania, the recipients of American shipments this year, the leading LNG suppliers are currently Qatar and Norway, Bordoff said. ""Europe has many actual and potential sources of natural gas and LNG,"" Sullivan said. ""The U.S. is one of them, but this will be small for some time. The U.S. will also be exporting to Asia due to the faster growth of Asian demand compared to Europe."" Succeeding in the European LNG market, Sullivan said, ""will take a long time and require massive investments."" • Russian business practices. ""Russia plays hardball with prices,"" Sullivan said. ""As soon as they see possible competition, they drop prices and change other characteristics of gas deals to try to slow the competition."" A final note: While neither Robertson nor Trump specifically credited Trump’s actions in office for the progress being made in LNG markets, we should note that these trends were already under way during the tenure of his predecessor, President Barack Obama. ""This is not thanks to Trump,"" Mikulska said. ""In fact, the Obama administration's policy to liberalize LNG exports is much more responsible for the growth in LNG trade."" Robertson said that ""Gazprom held Europe by the throat -- they were a monopoly, and now the U.S. is breaking into that monopoly with our exports of LNG."" He has a point -- Russia has a history of using natural gas supplies as an instrument of foreign policy, and a number of European countries are heavily reliant on Russian gas, making them susceptible to pressure. However, many European countries have other energy-supply options, and while the United States has made recent gains in the European LNG market, these advances have been limited and face challenges going forward.

Mike Pence falsely blames Medicaid expansion for disability waiting list in Ohio
","Providing more Americans health insurance through Medicaid might sound good in the abstract, but Vice President Mike Pence told a story recently about how it can have unintended and dire consequences. Speaking at the National Governors Association meeting in Rhode Island, Pence said in the state of Ohio -- which expanded Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act -- disabled Ohioans are unable to access care because able-bodied adults have been added to the Medicaid rolls. ""Obamacare has put far too many able-bodied adults on the Medicaid rolls, leaving many disabled and vulnerable Americans at the back of the line,"" Pence said July 14. ""Gov. (John) Kasich isn't with us, but I suspect that he's very troubled to know that in Ohio alone, nearly 60,000 disabled citizens are stuck on waiting lists, leaving them without the care they need for months or even years."" Is it true that Ohio’s expanded Medicaid system has sucked up state dollars that could have shortened the waiting list for the disabled in Ohio? Pence spokesman Marc Lotter said the vice president was saying that ""we need to provide states the flexibility to create systems that best meet the needs of their people."" Lotter pointed to a Wall Street Journal op-ed that said the more generous federal reimbursement for Medicaid expansion ""diverts resources from the program’s traditional targets."" ""A temporary enrollment freeze might lead Ohio to prioritize resources for the truly needy,"" the piece said. What we found is that there are about 60,000 people on county waiting lists across Ohio. But Pence is wrong to create a connection between the programs to help them and Medicaid expansion. The waiting list Pence mentioned is part of a 30-year-old effort by Washington to give states more options to keep the long-term disabled out of institutions. It’s called home and community-based services, or HCBS. The money can pay for a variety of services, such as adult day care and assistance at home with eating and dressing. States set the number of people who can apply for waivers and Washington picks up between 50 and 70 percent of the cost. That’s less favorable than the 90 percent share that the federal government pays for Americans who receive Medicaid as part of the Affordable Care Act expansion. Health analyst MaryBeth Musumeci at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a respected source of health care data, told us there’s no escaping these budget realities. ""The expansion adults are a less costly population in that they are generally healthier and therefore use less services than someone on an HCBS waiver who by definition has chronic and long-term care needs,"" Musumeci said. But when Musumeci crunched the data, she found no simple trade-off between expansion and waiting lists. In fact, states that didn’t expand Medicaid were more likely to see their waiting lists grow compared to those that did expand. Point being, Musumeci said, is that there is no relationship between the waiting list and Medicaid expansion. Pence also spoke too broadly when he said people were left without the care they need, Musumeci said. Musumeci and her colleagues found that just because someone is on a waiting list, that doesn’t mean they aren’t getting any Medicaid services. According to federal data, 93 percent of people on waiting lists with intellectual and developmental disabilities receive Medicaid services that don’t depend on the waiver process. As it turns out, the waiting lists in and of themselves don’t always show how many people are going without care. When the Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities commissioned a survey of people on the waiting list, it found that over 40 percent said they had ""no current area of need."" (The study was last updated in 2015.) Part of the problem Musumeci said is that the lists can include people from many years back. Their situations may have changed or some of them would never have qualified for waivers in the first place. Pence’s claim about Ohio also contradicts the work of advocates for the disabled. In an initial assessment, the National Council on Disability reported in 2016 that ""both interview results and available literature suggest that Medicaid expansion has helped people with disabilities."" The National Health Law Program, a group that advocates for the legal rights of the poor, agreed. It wrote that ""expanded eligibility for Medicaid means that some of people on waiting lists who could not qualify for Medicaid under the traditional categories now access Medicaid services, which includes some community-based services."" The group also said that ""states expanding Medicaid have saved millions in spending on people with disabilities, savings that could be used to expand HCBS programs."" Pence said that Medicaid expansion in Ohio left 60,000 people waiting for the services they need. We found no link between the waiting list and Medicaid expansion. In fact, studies found that Medicaid expansion increased services for the disabled. They also found that in Ohio, over 40 percent of people on those lists said they had no immediate need for services. In short, the size of the list is not a sound measure of need. One analysis argued that Medicaid expansion frees up state dollars that could go toward reducing the ranks of people on the waiting list. And overall, there is no clear connection between expanding Medicaid and rising waiting list numbers. In fact, non-expansion states were more likely to see their waiting lists grow. We rate this claim False.","[('White House, Remarks by the Vice President at the National Governors Association, July 14, 2017', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2017/07/14/remarks-vice-president-national-governors-association'), ('Wall Street Journal, John Kasich’s Medicaid Lecture, July 7, 2017', 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, Data Note: Data Do Not Support Relationship Between States’ Medicaid Expansion Status and Home and Community-Based Services Waiver Waiting Lists, Feb. 14, 2017', 'https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/john-kasichs-medicaid-lecture-1499466908'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Programs: 2013 Data Update, Oct. 18, 2016', 'No link'), ('Ohio Department of Medicaid, Waiver Services, accessed July 16, 2017', 'http://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/data-note-data-do-not-support-relationship-medicaid-expansion-hcbs-waiver-waiting-lists/'), ('Ohio Department of Medicaid, Waiting list fact sheet, accessed July 16, 2017', 'No link'), ('National Council on Disability, The Impact of the Affordable Care Act on People with Disabilities, Jan. 26, 2016', 'http://www.kff.org/medicaid/report/medicaid-home-and-community-based-services-programs-2013-data-update/'), ('The Arc, Emergency Weekend Medicaid Matters to Me Letter Writing Campaign, July 14, 2017', 'No link'), ('Center for Community Solutions, Ohio House Rolls Back Additional DODD Funding for Community Services, May 10, 2017', 'http://medicaid.ohio.gov/FOROHIOANS/Programs/HCBSWaivers.aspx'), ('National Health Law Program, Helping Those on HCBS Waiting Lists: Positive Impacts of the ACA, Feb. 14, 2017', 'No link'), ('Ohio Department of Developmental Disabilities, HCBS Waivers Waiting List 2015 Fact Sheet, 2015', 'http://dodd.ohio.gov/IndividualFamilies/ServiceFunding/Pages/Waiting-Lists.aspx'), ('Columbus Dispatch, VP Pence spreading ‘fake news’ about Ohio, July 14, 2017', 'No link'), ('MaryBeth Musumeci, associate director, Kaiser Family Foundation, July 16, 2017', 'https://ncd.gov/sites/default/files/NCD_ACA_Report02_508.pdf'), ('Marc Lotter, press secretary, Office of Vice President Mike Pence, July 16, 2017', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2017/jul/17/mike-pence/pence-falsely-ties-medicaid-expansion-disability-w/

Kid Rock announces U.S. Senate run, but needs to check rules with the FEC
","Musician and Michigan native Kid Rock lashed out at the media for allegedly bungling details about his intention to run for U.S. Senate, but it looks like this cowboy was a little too quick on the draw. Kid Rock (whose real name is Robert Ritchie) created a website, KidRockForSenate.com, announcing his interest in a 2018 campaign against Michigan incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat who has been in office since 2001. The site only offered a signup for email updates and a link to a ""Kid Rock for U.S. Senate"" web store. Previously, Kid Rock’s biggest foray into politics was a trip to the White House with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent in April. He confirmed the site was real on July 12, 2017, via Twitter and Facebook, leading to a flurry of news stories saying he’s now a devil with a cause. Reporters for the Washington Post and the New York Times noted they didn’t find any Federal Election Commission paperwork for Ritchie’s campaign. I'm not seeing any evidence that Kid Rock has filed with the FEC... I asked a spokesperson for Kid Rock if the tweet was real. If he'd file with the FEC, etc. As of now, spox referred me Kid Rock's FB: pic.twitter.com/N58kD799wL Kid Rock took exception to some of the coverage in a July 13 post on KidRock.com titled, ""Once again the press is wrong."" ""First of all, I’ve got 15 days from my announcement to file paperwork with the FEC!"" he wrote, without mentioning a specific report that he was refuting. ""Second, I’m not signed to Warner Bros!!! — which simple fact-checking would have revealed. I have recently worked out a unique deal with BMG, Broken Bow, CAA and Live Nation to release music ON MY TERMS."" He repeated that statement on Twitter and Facebook. People may have been confused about his current contracts because the July 13 post was actually the first time he had announced the new recording arrangements. Kid Rock spokesman Kirt Webster confirmed that his 2015 album First Kiss was his last with Warner Music Group. Webster also said Warner Bros. still does Kid Rock’s merchandising, so that’s why the Kid Rock for U.S. Senate web store is hosted by Warner Bros. Records. Don’t replace the Star-Spangled Banner with Bawitdaba just yet. Webster did not answer us when we asked if the Senate announcement was real, but Ritchie conspicuously released two new songs and announced a tour on July 14. But whether or not he’s on a lonely road of faith (these are Kid Rock lyrics, we hope you realize) to reach the Senate, Kid Rock’s explanation of FEC deadlines isn’t entirely accurate. The FEC website notes in its ""Quick Answers to Candidate Questions"" that how much money a potential candidate gets for or spends on a campaign determines the deadline for when they must file paperwork, not simply announcing an intention to run for office. If a Senate hopeful either receives $5,000 in contributions or spends $5,000 on a campaign, the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 says registration and reporting responsibilities take effect. FEC spokeswoman Judith Ingram said that a candidate has 15 days after that threshold has been reached to designate a principal campaign committee by either filing a Statement of Candidacy or a letter with the same information. Ten days after that, the committee must register a Statement of Organization. ""If a person has announced or is acting like a candidate AND has passed that $5,000 threshold, s/he becomes a candidate and the requirement to register with and report to the FEC kicks in,"" Ingram told us via email. For a Senate seat, the paperwork would be filed through the Office of the Secretary of the Senate, she said. Ingram didn’t know whether Kid Rock would meet the threshold by either spending $5,000 on his website or taking in $5,000 through sales of t-shirts and trucker caps (at least one campaign veteran thinks so). We’ll know if Kid Rock officially files within the next couple weeks, because this is a story we will follow all summer long. Kid Rock said, ""I’ve got 15 days from my announcement to file paperwork with the FEC!"" While he was quick to berate the press, Kid Rock oversimplified his explanation. Registration and reporting rules come into play after receiving or spending $5,000 on campaign activity, FEC rules say. Just saying you’re running for office doesn’t trigger the 15-day requirement, although it may be possible Kid Rock has already met that $5,000 limit somehow.

Did Stacey Evans help win one of the biggest private lawsuits against Medicare fraud in history?
","Stacey Evans is running for governor of Georgia, and she’s touting a major Medicare fraud case she argued with her private law practice in a campaign video. ""I helped win one of the biggest private lawsuits against Medicare fraud in history,"" Evans said on a June 12, 2017 campaign video. ""The government declined to pursue the case, so my firm did, and we recovered $324 million for taxpayers."" Evans is referring to a civil lawsuit she argued alongside three other firms representing the U.S. government against DaVita HealthCare Partners Inc., a leading provider of dialysis services in the United States. They represented two whistleblowers. The lawsuit alleged that DaVita was knowingly generating unnecessary waste when administering drugs to dialysis patients and then billing Medicare for the waste. Readers may recall the lawsuit from a recent installment of Last Week Tonight with John Oliver.   The company did not admit wrongdoing, but paid $450 million in settlements to resolve the claims. Washington University Law professor Kathleen Clark said that referring to the settlement as a victory is accurate, and characterized the settlement sum as an impressive feat. Was it one of the biggest in Medicare fraud history, though? When we asked Evans’ campaign what they meant by private lawsuit, they said they were referring to lawsuits filed under the False Claims Act, whistleblowers’ main vehicle to sue on behalf of the federal government for Medicare fraud when the government does not intervene. Justice Department spokesperson Nicole Navas confirmed Evans’ statement. ""DaVita recovery was one of the largest ever obtained by a relator in a matter declined by the United States,"" Navas said. There have been larger settlements, but only when the government has gone after fraud directly. In this case, the Justice Department chose not to intervene. Navas declined to comment on why they didn’t participate. ""It shouldn’t be taken as a government determination that the case doesn’t have merit,"" Clark said, noting the government has limited resources to pursue such cases. Lin Wood, the lead counsel on the case, said the government likely was unaware of all the details of the case when it decided not to pursue a lawsuit. ""We developed a tremendous body of factual evidence that I believe the government was unaware of at the time they made their decision,"" Wood said. He said the government would have likely intervened otherwise. When the government doesn’t intervene, clients are entitled to no less than 25 percent and no more than 30 percent of the settlement; according to Wood and Evans, they received 28 percent. The remainder, 72 percent or $324 million, went to the government. Wood called Evans an integral part of the case, and characterized the other two firms as having played a minor role. We wondered if that money went directly to taxpayers, as Evans said in the video. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, agreed with Evans’ wording that the money went to taxpayers, which he called a proxy for the treasury. Reducing the treasury’s deficit translates to a benefit to taxpayers. ""The taxes that individual citizens pay is not reduced nor does the money go directly into service benefitting people,"" Ellis said. ""But a smaller deficit means it is less likely that taxes are raised or services cut."" Evans said that she ""helped win one of the biggest private lawsuits against Medicare fraud in history."" The lead counsel on the case corroborated her role in it, and the Justice Department confirmed its historic importance. Her claim that they recovered $324 million for taxpayers also checks out.

Lewandowski wrongly says Trump in Florida day of Trump Tower meeting with Russian lawyer
","Questions continue to swirl around June 9, 2016, the day senior officials working on Donald Trump’s presidential campaign held a meeting with a Russian lawyer in hopes of gleaning derogatory information on Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The timeline around this meeting is key because a central line of questioning for investigators probing possible connections between the Trump campaign and the Russian government could likely be what did Donald Trump know about the meeting, and when did he know it? In an appearance on NBC’s MTP Daily, Trump’s campaign manager at the time recalled traveling with the candidate on June 9, 2016, for a Trump rally in Florida. ""What I do remember on that particular day was that was a day that Donald Trump was doing a rally in the state of Florida, so I traveled with the president that day,"" Corey Lewandowski said July 13, 2017. Was Trump in Florida on June 9, 2016, the day his son, Donald Trump Jr., and others met with a Russian lawyer in New York? No. Trump was in New York. Trump attended a fundraising lunch at the Four Seasons in New York before spending the rest of the day at Trump Tower. He also engaged in a Twitter feud that day with Clinton. That morning he took to Twitter and called Clinton ""Crooked Hillary,"" saying his Democratic rival would be a ""disaster"" on everything from the economy to the military to health care. The barbs continued throughout the day, with Trump lashing out at President Barack Obama over his endorsement of Clinton. ""Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary. He wants four more years of Obama — but nobody else does!"" Trump tweeted. Clinton replied that afternoon, urging Trump: ""Delete your account."" Trump then fired back: ""How long did it take your staff of 823 people to think that up — and where are your 33,000 emails that you deleted?"" According to a schedule of Trump’s rallies released by NBC, Trump held no rally on June 9, and he did not appear for a Florida rally until June 11 — two days after Trump Jr., then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner met at Trump Tower with the Russian lawyer. The date of Trump’s Florida rally is backed up by a Tampa Bay Times photo taken at the Tampa Convention Center in downtown Tampa on Saturday, June 11, 2016.  Lewandowski said ""Donald Trump was doing a rally in the state of Florida"" the day his son and others met with a Russian lawyer in New York. That’s wrong.

","Some clickbait is harder to kill than a vampire. Recently, as part of Facebook’s efforts to fight fake news, we learned that users had flagged as potentially fabricated a post about a claim purportedly by former Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn. Prior to her retirement after the 2014 midterm elections, Bachmann, a social conservative, was known for making controversial statements. So it may not come as a surprise that, more than two years after her retirement, she’s still being used by clickbait purveyors, banking on the anger of liberal social media users. The article noted by Facebook users, from the site USPOLN.com, is headlined, ""Bachmann: ‘White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery.’ "" Oddly, the words that the headline attributes in quotation marks to Bachmann do not appear in the subsequent article. But the ""quotes"" provided discuss similar themes. The article quotes Bachmann as saying, ""I don’t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what’s been done to white conservative Americans in the past eight years of Obama’s presidency. Because, let’s face it, during that time, we’ve had the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we’ve had countless terrorist attacks, we’ve had many racial killings and crimes and we’ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America’s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I’m guessing he does."" Before we go any further, it would be an opportune time to note that USPOLN.com is, as we have noted previously, contains a disclaimer in the ""about us"" tab that reads, ""USPOLN may include information from sources that may or may not be reliable and facts that don’t necessarily exist. These articles should be considered satirical and any and all quotes attributed to actual people complete and total baloney."" In other words, not a word of this ""story"" should be believed. However, this isn’t just fake news. It’s old fake news. (Perhaps the focus on Obama should have been a clue to its timing -- he’s been out of office for six months now.) We found that an essentially identical article appeared as early as Aug. 23, 2016, on the website Newslo, which bills itself as a mix of true and fake news. With the click of a button, you can see what’s real and what’s fake. If you click on the button, the part about Bachmann’s comments on slavery falls into the ""fake"" category. Moral of the story: Liberal dislike of Bachmann has survived her retirement so strongly that it is able to carry multiple iterations of clickbait. The website USPOLN.com said in a post that Bachmann had said, ""White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery."" Not only is USPOLN.com an acknowledged ""satirical"" site, but the post originated in August 2016 on another acknowledged purveyor of articles that it admits are partially fake. We rate the item Pants on Fire.","[('USPOLN.com, ""Bachmann: ‘White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery,’ "" July 7, 2017', 'http://uspoln.com/2017/07/07/bachmann-white-people-suffered-last-8-years-blacks-couple-years-slavery/'), ('USPOLN.com, disclaimer, accessed July 10, 2017', 'No link'), ('Newslo, ""Bachmann: ""White People Have Suffered More In The Last 8 Years Than Blacks Did During Couple Years Of Slavery,’ "" Aug. 23, 2016', 'http://uspoln.com/about-us/')]",/factchecks/2017/jul/14/uspoln/no-bachmann-didnt-say-whites-suffered-more-under-o/

Tens of millions in tax money directed to a Milwaukee streetcar at the expense of police, schools?
","A newly formed group that wants Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett removed from office accuses him of ""malfeasance"" over the use of city money for a $128 million streetcar line. The group Save Our City, Milwaukeeans Can't Wait filed a notice with the city on July 7, 2017, that aims to force a recall election. In it, the group makes four charges against Barrett, starting with one about the streetcar, which the group refers to as a trolley. Barrett, the group claims in the notice, ""has directed that tens of millions of City of Milwaukee tax dollars be used for the construction of a downtown trolley at the expense of: health and public safety; repair and replacement of public infrastructure; public education; and, job creation and economic development."" The streetcar is mostly funded with federal transportation money specifically allocated many years ago for that purpose. But is the streetcar also getting tens of millions of city tax dollars that could have been used for things such as police, streets and schools? The group and the recall To trigger a recall election, Save Our City, Milwaukeeans Can't Wait would need more than 51,000 petition signatures within 60 days of the notice from eligible voters in Milwaukee. Candidates could then run against Barrett, a former Democratic congressman who was elected to his fourth term as mayor in April 2016 with 70 percent of the vote. The notice was filed by Milwaukee resident Allen L. Jansen, who did not return our call seeking information to back up the group’s statement about the streetcar. The group's treasurer, Darryl Farmer, told us he would not comment on the statement. Farmer, who is known as ""King Rick"" and leads the Original Black Panthers of Milwaukee, has been critical of racial inequities in Milwaukee, citing them when he threatened recalls without specifying any names in August 2016. Those threats followed an uprising in the city that occurred after the fatal shooting of a man by a police officer in Milwaukee’s Sherman Park neighborhood. As for recalls in Wisconsin, Barrett ran unsuccessfully against Republican Gov Scott Walker in 2012, when Walker became the nation’s first governor to ever survive a recall election. The streetcar Laying of the track for the 2.5-mile downtown-area streetcar project began in May 2017. Service for the initial route is expected to begin in fall 2018. Barrett and other supporters have said the electrically powered, 150-passenger streetcars will improve mass transit and attract commercial and residential development. Critics counter that the project takes development away from areas that are not on the streetcar line and that city residents would be better served by an improved bus system with the flexibility to readily change routes. When state Rep. Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna, said the streetcar would be a ""1900s-style trolley,"" our rating was Half True. The cars will run on fixed routes on steel rails like the city’s old streetcar system. But they will be modern and are envisioned as a transportation system spurring economic development, not as some kind of nostalgic system. It’s clear from the city’s own streetcar website that tens of millions of city tax dollars have been committed to the project. Of the estimated $128 million construction cost, more than half -- $69 million -- comes from two federal grants specifically allocated for the streetcar. The other $59 million comes from three tax incremental financing districts (sometimes known as TIF districts or TIDs). That $59 million was authorized when the Common Council approved the project on a 9-6 vote in February 2015. So, it was not only Barrett but also aldermen who approved the TIF districts. But it’s not as though $59 million is being redirected from city coffers to the streetcar. Under state law, TIF money can only be used for development and redevelopment projects. TIF funding When then-Milwaukee Ald. Joe Davis said the streetcar ""would actually take precious revenue away"" from the Milwaukee Public Schools, our rating was Mostly False. Here’s why -- an explanation that applies to the recall group’s claim as well: With a TIF district, the city borrows money to pay for infrastructure improvements, such as new roads or, in this case, the streetcar line. The money is repaid through taxes generated by the increased value of properties within the district. In other words, those increased property tax dollars pay off the debt rather than going to the general funds of the city, Milwaukee County, Milwaukee Public Schools and other taxing bodies. Once the borrowing is paid off, the increased value of the land is added to the general tax rolls. Critics could argue that property values along the streetcar line would increase without the streetcar, and in that sense the city and other taxing bodies are losing that increased property tax revenue while the TIF is in place. But by law, tax money being collected through a TIF district can’t be used for other purposes such as police or schools. Moreover, if the streetcar does, as Barrett and others argue, spur downtown-area development, that will increase the overall property tax base. That would mean that once the TIF borrowing is paid off, there will be more property tax base for the city and the other taxing bodies than there would have been without the streetcar. Our rating Save Our City, Milwaukeeans Can't Wait says Barrett ""has directed that tens of millions of City of Milwaukee tax dollars be used for the construction of a downtown trolley at the expense of: health and public safety; repair and replacement of public infrastructure; public education; and, job creation and economic development."" Tens of millions of tax dollars are being directed toward construction of a downtown-area streetcar line, which is now under way. But it is in the form of borrowing that can only be done for projects such as a streetcar. These are not funds that would otherwise be available for purposes such as police and schools. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.","[(""Save Our City, Milwaukeeans Can't Wait, notice to file recall petitition, July 7, 2017"", 'https://htv-prod-media.s3.amazonaws.com/files/intent-to-recall-barrett-070717-pdf-1499451176.pdf'), (""Interview, Save Our City, Milwaukeeans Can't Wait treasurer Darryl Farmer, July 10, 2017"", 'No link'), ('Email, Tom Barrett communications director Jodie Tabak, July 11, 2017', 'https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2015/feb/03/joe-davis-sr/ald-joe-davis-claims-streetcar-project-would-hurt-/'), ('Email, City of Milwaukee public works communications manager Sandra Rusch Walton, July 11, 2017', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Wisconsin, ""Ald.

Can marijuana smoking cause lung cancer?
","John Morgan, the lawyer who spearheaded Florida’s 2016 constitutional amendment to allow medical marijuana use, says that the Legislature has ignored the will of the voters by banning smoking it. In November, about 71 percent of Florida voters approved the medical marijuana amendment. To implement the new law, the Legislature passed a provision that defines medical use to exclude smoking marijuana. Morgan filed a lawsuit July 6 asking the Leon County Circuit Court to declare the Legislature’s provision unenforceable. He says that while the amendment allows the Legislature to ban smoking in public, it does not allow it to ban smoking in general. In the lawsuit, Morgan made some claims about the benefits of marijuana and then said this: ""Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer or emphysema attributed to marijuana."" There have been people who smoked marijuana who had lung cancer, but that in itself doesn’t tell us if marijuana caused the cancer. We found some evidence to support Morgan’s statement, but the research comes with significant caveats and experts say more research is needed to reach more definitive conclusions. (Morgan also mentioned emphysema, but we will focus here on cancer.) Ben Pollara, who worked with Morgan on the amendment, sent us multiple articles related to research on cancer and marijuana. The most comprehensive information comes from a January 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine. The report was written by a committee of experts who reviewed studies since 1999 regarding health effects of using cannabis and cannabis-derived products related to various diseases including lung cancer. In the section on lung cancer, the researchers looked at research and concluded: ""There is moderate evidence of no statistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of lung cancer."" However the committee also noted that the studies it reviewed -- and research in general about marijuana -- had limitations: • A 2015 study published in the journal Cancer pooled data on 2,159 lung cancer cases. This study found no statistically significant association between smoking cannabis and lung cancer incidence including for a subgroup of study participants who were not tobacco smokers. However, the study noted that ""the possibility of potential adverse effect for heavy consumption cannot be excluded."" The study relied on patients’ self-reporting about their use of cannabis. • In 2015, the American Association for Cancer Research published an epidemiologic review. One study evaluated lung cancer risk among 49,321 Swedish military conscripts over a 40-year period and found they had a statistically significant risk of developing lung cancer compared with those who didn’t use cannabis. However, the report noted several gaps related to the Swedish study, which the author has acknowledged. Overall, the National Academies report called for more research about marijuana and health effects while noting several barriers, including that it is classified as a Schedule 1 substance and that researchers often find it difficult to gain access to the quantity, quality, and type of cannabis product necessary to address specific research questions. Pollara also pointed to information on the American Cancer Society website that listed marijuana in a section on factors with uncertain or unproven effects on lung cancer risk. The ACS states that there are some reasons to think that smoking marijuana might increase lung cancer risk, including that marijuana smoke contains tar. However, it also explains that it’s difficult to research the impact of marijuana since the use has been illegal in many places for a long time, and many lung cancer patients have smoked marijuana and tobacco, making it difficult to attribute causes. ""More research is needed to know the cancer risks from smoking marijuana,"" ACS states. Many experts we reached echoed the sentiment that additional research is needed. Harvard Medical School professor Bertha K. Madras reviewed multiple studies and her conclusion was similar to the National Academies report that there didn’t appear to be an association. However, Madras expressed caution about reaching conclusions. ""Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence,"" she told PolitiFact. ""Data are old. Currently we have more persons smoking high potency marijuana daily than years ago, when most studies were collecting data."" A 2016 literature review written by University of Tampa health sciences professor Mary Martinasek showed that while some studies indicated an increased risk of lung cancer, others found no such link or a lower risk for lung cancer.  ""There is little evidence to support statistical associations either for or against cannabis and lung cancer,"" she said. ""We need more research to confirm or deny an association."" Dr. Suzanne Sisley, who is an expert witness for Morgan and is doing an FDA approved trial related to marijuana and PTSD, said that the federal government has sought for decades to prove smoking marijuana caused lung cancer and has been unable to do so. Morgan said, ""Despite decades of marijuana being used for smoking in the United States, there have been no reported medical cases of lung cancer"" attributed to marijuana. The most comprehensive analysis about the health effects related to cannabis comes from a 2017 report by the National Academies of Sciences. The report found ""moderate evidence of no statistical association between cannabis smoking and the incidence of lung cancer."" However, the report also noted various limitations of the research. Overall, the academies called for more research -- a sentiment shared by other experts we interviewed.  Morgan’s statement is partially accurate, but more evidence is needed before definitely declaring smoking marijuana is risk-free when it comes to lung cancer. We rate the statement Half True.","[('National Academies of Science and Engineering, ""The Health Effects of Cannabis and Cannabinoids: The Current State of Evidence and Recommendations for Research,"" Jan. 12, 2017', 'http://www.nationalacademies.org/hmd/Reports/2017/health-effects-of-cannabis-and-cannabinoids.aspx'), ('Cancer, ""Cannabis smoking and lung cancer risk: Pooled analysis in the International Lung Cancer Consortium,"" (Zhang et al) February 2015', 'No link'), ('Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers Prevention, ""An epidemiologic review of marijuana and cancer: an update,"" (Huang et al) January 2015', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24947688'), ('National Institute on Drug Abuse, Marijuana, Accessed July 12, 2017', 'No link'), ('American Cancer Society, ""Small cell lung cancer risk factors,"" Accessed July 11, 2017', 'https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25587109'), ('World Health Organization article by Bertha K.

Paul Workman says apartment development fees in Austin nearly 10 times fees in Dallas
","An Austin Republican applauding Gov. Greg Abbott for trying to rein in regulations imposed by cities, including Austin, says municipal development fees for building an apartment complex in the capital run nearly 10 times ahead of what’s charged in Dallas. Readers asked us to check that. State Rep. Paul Workman said in his June 2017 commentary in the Austin American-Statesman: ""I have received a document from an apartment builder that demonstrates the difference in total development fees for building a project in Dallas versus building the same project in Austin. Total fees in Dallas: $120,081. Total fees in Austin: $1,026,852 – nearly 10-times higher for the same project! There is no way to argue that these fees are not contributing to the affordability crisis in Austin."" We zeroed in on the declared figures after Brian Mitchell in Workman’s state office emailed us an undated document showing fees attributed to the cities of Dallas and Austin, respectively, in each case to authorize construction of a four-story, 243,000-square-foot, 322-unit apartment project. Workman didn’t say who created or provided the document. But John Burnham, managing director of Argyle Residential, which develops multi-family projects in major cities including Austin and Denver, told us he created the document in June 2016 or so. Burnham said by phone the Austin figures on the document relate to a 322-unit project, anticipated at Gonzales and Tillery streets in East Austin, and the Dallas figures were based on adjusting up city fees associated with plans to build a 260-unit project on the east side of Dallas. Burnham said by email: ""The purpose of my spreadsheet was to illustrate the difference in permitting costs associated with a 322-unit wrap-style apartment project in Austin vs that same project in Dallas. I was not attempting to display a summary of actual fees paid on a specific project. The fees that I outlined are accurate fees based on adopted ordinances and city codes. We have paid roughly these amounts on several projects in Austin and Dallas recently."" Variation in figures Burnham didn’t provide more data. For our part, we asked Austin city officials to review the 23 fees listed in Burnham’s document for the described project in that city and we asked Dallas officials to check the nine fees listed for such a Dallas project. According to the respective officials, the presented dollar-for-dollar comparison missed some fees while overstating and understating a few. Still, it came out that there were far higher total fees likely in Austin than in Dallas. Dallas fees By email, a Dallas city spokesman, Richard Hill, provided a document showing what he described as the best estimate by city officials there of the fees likely associated with a 322-unit complex in that city in 2017. That Dallas document suggests total costs of $124,792.02, some $4,711 or 4 percent greater than the total fee costs estimated by Burnham about a year before. A big added cost, according to the city, would come from at least $23,000 for a base permit for the complex’s garage, compared with $16,645 in Burnham’s document. The Dallas document also specifies $1,500 in fees for up to three engineering reviews of paving/grading/drainage as well as $2,690.66 for a fire sprinkler review for the garage; the document cited by Workman did  not specify those fees. The Dallas document also suggests some lower costs than estimated by Burnham such as $8,250 related to the city’s express review of the development plan compared with $12,000 estimated by Burnham. Similarly, the Dallas document indicates $2,714 in fees for two four-inch water meters and a wastewater connection compared with $7,380 in the document Workman touted, and $735 for irrigation meter permits compared with $2,650 in the other document. Austin fees By email and phone, a City of Austin spokeswoman, Sylvia Arzola, confirmed most of the city fees listed in the Workman-cited document in connection with the envisioned project, but she said the garage fees would be about $6,000 lower if that facility didn’t have plumbing and wasn’t heated or air-conditioned. Arzola noted that a major cost shown for Austin and not Dallas--a parkland dedication fee--increased as of October 2016 so the up-to-date charge on the described project would be $346,230, nearly $43,000 greater than the fee shown on what Workman cited. Arzola noted too that developers may donate land in lieu of paying the fee. Arzola wrote that the Workman-cited document appears to have missed a fee--the city’s Commercial Building Plan Review fee calculated based on a builder’s valuation of labor and materials. Working from the city’s web post of commercial review and permit fees, it looked to us like the fee on the project would start at $655.20 plus $1.30 for every $1,000 in labor-materials. Arzola further confirmed Austin doesn’t offer an expedited review like the one described for Dallas, but she said one is in the works; its target rollout date is October 2017. Water-wastewater fees We spotted another wide contrast. Both cities, the Workman-cited document says, charge a fee for domestic water and wastewater meters, but Austin’s fee, $380,000, greatly outpaces the Dallas fee, $7,380. A note on the document says the Austin figure assumes the development site requires a replat. If that’s not so, the note says, the Austin water/wastewater fee drops to $55,000. By phone, Joseph Gonzales, a finance administrator for the Austin Water Utility, said the document's Austin figures for water and wastewater meter and irrigation meter fees appeared accurate. Asked to speak to Austin charging considerably more than Dallas for such fees, Gonzales said: ""We’re trying to balance the impact of development between the development community and our ratepayers."" Dallas-Austin contrasts Next, we inquired generally into why the cities have dramatically distinct fee schedules in connection with building apartment complexes. By phone, Carl Wren, assistant director of Austin’s Development Services Department, told us some Austin fees reflect the greater complexity of the city’s municipal code. He said Dallas, for instance, doesn’t have the Save Our Springs limits put in place in the 1990s to protect waters flowing into Barton Springs. Austin developers told us the city’s development fees amount to one of various factors affecting affordable housing. Terry Mitchell, a veteran local developer, said by email: ""On one affordable project of which I am aware, $3,000 per unit is being spent on tree replacement (even after preserving all heritage trees)."" David Stauch, president of Capital Project Management, an Austin construction company, said he's helped build projects in both cities. Stauch said Austin’s plan review fees run considerably higher ""likely owing to the greater number of departmental reviews required, and the greater level of scrutiny by each,"" perhaps a tradeoff for ""quality of the built environment, but folks in Dallas like it just fine,"" he said. Stauch further said the ""increased fees might also be due to Austin’s low density. The more spread out a city is, the more infrastructure needed to serve the residents."" A 2015 U.S. Census Bureau report based on 2013 population estimates pegs the density of Dallas at 3,684 residents per square mile, 29 percent greater than Austin’s density of 2,855 residents per square mile. Brian Rodgers, an Austin civic activist and real estate investor, said it makes good sense for developers to pay for the impact of their development on public infrastructure. Rodgers further noted by email that it’s been state law since 1989 that cities may recoup water, wastewater, roads and drainage costs related to extending city services. ""Austin doesn’t charge"" developer fees ""for roads or drainage,"" Rodgers added. Our  ruling Workman said it’s documented that City of Austin fees for building an apartment complex are nearly 10 times Dallas’s fees. We found accurate multiple itemized entries in the 2016 document cited by Workman though there also were missing fees and some figures that weren't right. On balance, it looks like city fees for building the project in Austin could exceed Big D’s fees by eight times or more, still making for a considerable difference. We rate the claim Mostly True.

Trump has said, Priebus told host Chris Wallace, that Russia ""probably meddled in the election, they did meddle in the election."" Priebus continued: ""The one thing that he also says -- which drives the media crazy, but it’s an absolute fact -- is that others have as well, and that's true. China has, North Korea has and they have consistently over many, many years."" The White House didn’t reply to our emails seeking information to back Priebus’ statement. But experts told us that, aside from the Chung affair, there is no evidence that China -- and certainly not North Korea -- have meddled in American elections. And what U.S. intelligence agencies say the Russians did is far different from the Chung matter. Russia’s meddling Here is how the agencies began their key findings on Russian meddling in a January 2017 report: Russian efforts to influence the 2016 U.S. presidential election represent the most recent expression of Moscow’s longstanding desire to undermine the US-led liberal democratic order, but these activities demonstrated a significant escalation in directness, level of activity and scope of effort compared to previous operations. We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments. As has been widely reported, Russian hackers stole emails from the Democratic National Committee and gave them to WikiLeaks. Russian actors gained access to several states’ electoral agencies. Experts believe that Russia was behind a misinformation and propaganda campaign pushing exaggerated or false stories that would spread on social media and get picked up by English-language conspiratorial websites. Most recently, in July 2017, it was reported that Donald Trump Jr. met with a Russian agent who had promised to provide damaging information about Hillary Clinton, and that the president's son knew the allegedly incriminating information was being peddled by the highest levels of the Russian government in order to support the Trump campaign. China and North Korea The dozen experts we contacted said they were aware of no evidence to back Priebus’ claim, or were aware only of the Chung matter. In the Chung case, money was inappropriately or illegally given to a candidate’s campaign account. Priebus’ claim suggests a much broader and government-orchestrated foreign effort, on par with the Russian one. ""It’s possible there is some classified intelligence report on China and North Korea and U.S. elections, but I have never heard this claim before, nor seen any evidence,"" said University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor Yoshiko Herrera, who is the former director of the school’s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia. ""Also, I think for both China and North Korea, they see little difference between U.S. presidential candidates, but rather think of American politicians in general as opposed to China’s or North Korea’s interests, so I don’t know what the motivation for meddling in elections would be."" Indeed, Priebus’ claim struck some experts as bizarre. ""I have never heard this charge before,"" said political science professor Robert Ross, an associate at the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University. Experts on North Korea were more blunt. ""This notion that North Korea meddles in American elections is completely baseless,"" said Mitchell Lerner, director of the Institute for Korean Studies at Ohio State University. ""It’s sort of a stunning assertion,"" said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council in New York. ""I just don’t know where it’s coming from. There certainly is no evidence for it."" Our rating Speaking to Russia’s meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Priebus said: ""It's an absolute fact"" that China and North Korea ""have consistently over many, many years"" meddled in U.S. elections. During President Bill Clinton’s 1996 reelection campaign, money from Chinese citizens, including the head of China’s military agency, was illegally funneled to the reelection effort. But there is no evidence that either China or North Korea -- consistently and over many years -- meddled in U.S. elections. And certainly nothing on the scale of the Russian efforts in the 2016 presidential race, which reached to the highest levels of the Russian government. We rate Priebus’ statement False.","[('Fox News, ""Fox News Sunday"" Reince Priebus interview (4:25), July 9, 2017', 'http://www.foxnews.com/transcript/2017/07/09/reince-priebus-breaks-down-trumps-trip-to-g-20-summit.html'), ('PolitiFact National, ""17 intelligence organizations or 4?

Fake news saga wrongly says Nancy Pelosi’s daughters caught smuggling drugs
","A series of fake news posts appearing across several websites said U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi’s daughters were arrested for smuggling drugs, but the articles are so inaccurate, they don’t even bother to consistently use the same fake names. The bogus saga of the House minority leader’s children is widespread and convoluted: Facebook users flagged a string of stories starting on July 6, 2017, appearing on wazanews.tk, as part of the social media site’s efforts to combat fake news. The posts all invoked Pelosi’s name, but details from story to story did not agree. Essentially, the articles said two of the California Democrat’s adult daughters had been arrested for smuggling cocaine. But the details of what happened after that premise was asserted varied wildly in the following days. At first the women were said to be caught in Berkeley, Calif., with more than 200 pounds of cocaine in their Winnebago. Later stories claimed they were apprehended at the Mexican border. The yarn went on and on, across several posts. The gist is that the women ran a drug ring out of a pool house, and agreed to turn on their mother after they were caught. Somehow Nancy Pelosi faced charges for ethical violations, breaking federal drug laws and committing treason. (It’s never really specified how.)   Eventually Hillary Clinton was implicated, and the women were in protective custody when the cabin in which they were staying burned down. They turned up alive in Buffalo, N.Y., however, so all was well. Wazanews.tk is a website registered in Amsterdam, but the stories appeared to originate on OurLandOfTheFree.com, FreedomCrossroads.us or TheLastLineOfDefense.org, a site run by Christopher Blair. He writes absurd stories about Democrats with the goal of tricking conservative readers into believing they (and his website) are real. OurLandOfTheFree.com said it ""makes no guarantee that anything you find here will be based at all in reality."" FreedomCrossroads.us has an About Us page that claims the site ""uses facts that don’t exist and relies more on imagination than the truth."" The posts don’t align very well, with details varying from story to story, such as the women’s ages or even names, which change constantly. Sometimes the pair are called Heather and Nicole. Or maybe Julie Marie and Nicole Lynn. Or Jillian and Veronica. Or Amber and Carly. Or Louanne and Marissa. For the record, Pelosi’s five children are daughters Christine, Alexandra, Jacqueline and Nancy, and one son named Paul. At least a couple of images used on posts were actually of two women arrested for smuggling drugs. But those photos were of a pair of Scots arrested in Peru for trying to sneak cocaine to Spain in 2013. The grand finale is a July 9 post on TheLastLineOfDefense.org under the headline, ""Liberal troll paid $100K for Nancy Pelosi drug bust hoax."" The post said George Soros paid the author to fool people for his own amusement, but that ""in the end, everyone knows Pelosi is guilty and (Hillary) Clinton is behind everything."" Don’t be fooled by tales of Pelosi’s daughters being busted for drugs. It’s a fictional soap opera created to amuse trolls.

Is 'collusion' illegal? Fox News host says no
","Following Sean Hannity’s exclusive interview with Donald Trump Jr., Fox News host Eric Bolling repeated an argument that the network’s personalities have used before — that even if someone from the Trump campaign colluded with the Russian government, collusion itself is not a crime. Bolling and his Fox News Specialists co-hosts Eboni Williams and Kat Timpf appeared on the network after Hannity’s hourlong show on July 11, 2017. Trump Jr. had defended himself for meeting with a Russian lawyer in hopes of receiving damaging information on Hillary Clinton during the 2016 presidential campaign. While discussing Trump Jr.’s comments, Williams noted that she didn’t see evidence of collusion. Bolling then added, ""Collusion is not illegal either, by the way."" We reached out to Fox News and did not hear back, but the network’s personalities have used similar arguments before. We’re not going to weigh in on whether Trump Jr. actually broke any laws, but we did wonder if there were laws that would apply to the idea of collusion. Legal scholars told us that the word ""collusion"" may not appear in statutes, but working with Russian officials could still violate criminal law. Daniel Lowenstein, law professor emeritus at UCLA, considered collusion a vague term that would describe ""some course of conduct that is adverse to someone else’s interests,"" especially if it were being done in secret. ""It seems to me that what has been meant by collusion since this controversy began has been some agreement or understanding that the Russians would in some way assist Trump’s electoral prospects and would be rewarded in some way by Trump as president acting favorably toward Russia,"" Lowenstein said. ""That would very likely be illegal and surely would be highly improper."" Stanford University law professor Nathaniel Persily cited the Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act of 2002. A 2011 U.S. District Court ruling based on that law found that foreign nationals could not make expenditures ""to expressly advocate the election or defeat of a political candidate."" ""A foreign national spending money to influence a federal election can be a crime,"" Persily said. ""And if a U.S. citizen coordinates, conspires or assists in that spending, then it could be a crime."" The 2002 law enhanced penalties for violating statute for contributions and donations by foreign nationals that have been in effect since 1966, according to Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, a professor at the Stetson University College of Law. It’s relevant if Trump Jr. thought he was getting information about Clinton. ""Since opposition research is typically something one would have to pay for, it is reasonable to consider opposition research ‘a thing of value’ under this statute,"" she said. University of Kentucky law professor Josh Douglas agreed that soliciting ""dirt"" on Clinton could arguably be considered valuable under federal law. He also said working with a foreign entity in a federal election could potentially be subject to public corruption or anti-coercion federal election law. John Coates, a Harvard University law professor, said that Russians looking to affect the election could potentially be defined as an expenditure. The related funds could be construed as an illegal contribution to a candidate who coordinates with the foreigner, he said. Discussions between a campaign and a foreigner could violate the law against fraud, Coates added. ""Under that statute, it is a federal crime to conspire with anyone, including a foreign government, to ‘deprive another of the intangible right of honest services,’ "" he said. ""That would include fixing a fraudulent election, in my view, within the plain meaning of the statute."" University of California, Irvine law professor Rick Hasen said that in addition to possible violations of campaign finance and other federal laws, the Trump campaign could be open to another charge. ""If others participated in the scheme to do this it could be a conspiracy,"" Hasen said. ""Whether you want to call that ‘collusion’ or not seems besides the point."" Bolling said ""collusion is not illegal."" Legal scholars told us the word ""collusion"" is vague and may not be specifically used in legal language. But conduct that may be described as collusion could potentially be subject to multiple federal laws, including statutes on foreign contributions to elections and fraud.

Is Medicaid driving the budget deficit, as Pat Toomey said?
","Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Penn., defended the Senate health care bill’s curbing of Medicaid spending by calling Medicaid the single-biggest driver of the federal budget deficit. Toomey said the proposed cuts to Medicaid spending would slow the growth of entitlement programs, which he claimed are ""driving the fiscal train wreck we’re on"" in a Morning Joe interview on July 10, 2017. Medicaid ""is the one that is growing most rapidly, and is contributing to 70 percent of our budget deficit right now. It’s the one that is in our lap because of Obamacare,"" Toomey said. Is Medicaid the primary culprit behind the federal budget deficit? We found Toomey is playing parlor games with budget figures. When we asked Toomey’s office for evidence that Medicaid is contributing up to 70 percent of the deficit, they pointed out that spending on Medicaid is equal to 70 percent of the deficit. They divided projections on Medicaid spending in 2017 ($389 billion) by the estimated budget deficit ($559 billions) to get 69.6 percent. The figures come from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, or CBO. The problem is, that same calculation can be made with any federal program to reach a different conclusion. Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute, agreed with Toomey’s arithmetic. But, he said, the framework of the calculation is misleading. ""I’m not a fan of creating a link between the deficit and any program, Medicaid or otherwise ... but it happens all the time,"" Mitchell said. Dividing Medicaid spending by the budget deficit makes little sense to Dean Baker, the co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research. By the same logic, Baker said, ""since we will spend $634 billion on the military this year, defense spending is more than 100 percent responsible for the deficit. No one would take this argument seriously about the military and the deficit, nor should they take his argument seriously about Medicaid and the deficit."" Defense spending would account for 113 percent of the deficit, non-defense discretionary spending 103 percent, and Medicare 101 percent if we were to divide spending by the deficit in the same way Toomey did. ""Clearly, there’s something misleading about the calculation you’re making when things are adding up to 300 percent or more,"" said Ben Sommers, a health policy and economics professor at Harvard University. Toomey’s office made a more nuanced argument about their calculation, though, discussing Medicaid in the context of entitlements and net spending. ""Unlike the other entitlement programs, Medicaid has no dedicated revenue stream, so it is taken solely out of general revenue or the deficit. Therefore, when direct revenue streams are taken into account, Medicaid spends the most on net,"" said Kasia Mulligan, the communications director for Toomey. Medicaid looks worse compared with Medicare or Social Security because its federal share is wholly financed by general revenues, whereas Medicare is partially covered by payroll taxes and premiums, according to Diane Rowland, executive vice president at the Kaiser Family Foundation. General revenues still help finance Medicare and Social Security, however. Discounting payroll taxes and premiums, Medicare represents 34 percent of the deficit and Social Security 17 percent (using Toomey's rationale). This would make Medicaid the biggest contributor within entitlements, but entitlements aren’t the only contributors to the deficit. Defense spending is also wholly financed by general revenues, and surpasses Medicaid in the amount it contributes to the deficit. ""All spending has to be paid for with tax revenue from some source, or it contributes to the deficit,"" Sommers said. ""There’s no way to say that a dollar spent on Medicaid is any more responsible for the deficit than a dollar spent on defense or discretionary spending or anything else the government does."" Toomey blamed Medicaid spending on the Affordable Care Act, but the new law isn’t entirely responsible for Medicaid’s entire costs. Elderly people and those with disabilities account for two-thirds of Medicaid spending and low-income children account for one-fifth; two groups that were unaffected by the Medicaid expansion introduced by the Affordable Care Act, Rowland said. Medicaid spending has been growing faster than Medicare or Social Security in recent years, as Toomey said, but per-capita costs are actually growing at a slower rate than for Medicare or private insurance. An increased number of people covered by Medicaid is responsible for higher costs. The cost of this increased coverage was covered by taxes imposed by the Affordable Care Act that added to the general revenue so as not to grow the deficit. Toomey’s team told us that he has been concerned about Medicaid spending both before and after the Affordable Care Act. Toomey maintains that Medicaid was not on a sustainable fiscal path even before Obamacare was enacted. Toomey said that Medicaid is contributing to 70 percent of our budget deficit. The truth is, Medicaid spending annually is about 70 percent of the size of the federal budget deficit. The same logic, if applied to defense spending, would mean defense spending contributes more than 100 percent to the deficit. Experts say both comparisons are flawed and misleading. Blaming the Affordable Care Act for the rise in Medicaid spending isn’t entirely right either, as the majority of Medicaid spending was already in place before the law, and taxes were imposed to offset the Medicaid expansion’s strain on the deficit. Toomey's claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.We rate this statement Mostly False. Update: This report has been updated to include additional comments from Toomey on Medicaid spending that we received after our initial publication. The rating remains unchanged.

Recycled parody: CNN's Zakaria calls for jihadi rape of white women
","CNN’s Fareed Zakaria presents himself as an urbane observer of the global scene and not the sort of person to call for violence against women. But the website teoinfo.com sought to cast Zakaria in a much different -- and false -- light. The website ran an article June 30 with the headline: CNN Host Fareed Zakaria Calls For Jihad Rape Of White Women. Facebook readers flagged the story as being potentially fake, so we decided to investigate. For fake news watchers, the opening paragraph of the story was a stroll down memory lane. It said, ""Fareed Zakaria, CNN host of ‘Foreign Affairs,’ a program focusing on international events, has in his private blog called for the merciless rape of white females by Islamic minority groups shortly after openly gloating over the rise in premature deaths of white males in his article in the Washington Post."" Not only is that bizarre, it is a word-for-word copy and paste from an article over a year ago on the satirical website The People’s Cube. The self-described site for ""political humor"" once touted that it ranked No. 13 on a list of humor blogs. Among its recent headlines, it announced, ""Russia adds St. Patrick’s Day to list of excuses to get drunk,"" as part of the country’s ""Day Without Sobriety"" campaign. The website adopts a faux-Soviet style, purportedly the brainchild of ""a former Soviet agitprop artist."" When the article first appeared Jan. 2, 2016, Zakaria complained that he was the victim of internet trolls. In response, the People’s Cube (it features a Rubik's cube with red on all sides) published an open letter on Jan. 18, 2016. ""This parody wasn't meant to be taken as factual reporting, given the context of our website and especially considering the author's credentials at the top: Chedoh, Kommissar of Viral Infections, Hero of Change, Prophet of the Future Truth."" (The author’s avatar is a cheeto with a Che Guevara face, which makes sense if you say Chedoh the ""right"" way.)

It's fake news that a 3,000-pound shark was caught in Lake Michigan
","A story that fishermen caught a 3,000-pound white shark in Lake Michigan is fake news. NotAllowedTo.com ran a post on June 22 that said a Canadian tourist and his friend from Chicago had caught a shark responsible for the deaths of 100 people who went missing over the past decade. The catch and deaths are fabricated. The story is a shorter version of a June 20, 2016, post published on World News Daily Report, a satirical news site. ""We’ve heard a few times about this story, and there's no fact to it,"" said Christopher Yaw, a spokesperson for the District Nine Coast Guard. Great white sharks can’t swim in freshwater, as it dilutes their internal salt levels. That dehydrates them and decreases their buoyancy, so that they sink. The story quotes a biology professor at the University of Illinois on the rarity of the find, but a search of his name on the university’s database yielded no results. The post claims there was a 1916 shark attack in Lake Eerie that led to a 14 year swimming ban, but we found no traces of this attack or a ban. The most famous actual 1916 attack occurred on the Jersey Shore, in salt water. We also found no credible reports of disappearances on the lake. A disclaimer at the bottom of the story calls NotAllowedTo.com a satire entertainment website. ""We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or currency of any information on this Web Site,"" a disclaimer reads. This claim is bogus. We rate it Pants on Fire!","[('NotAllowedTo.com, ""3,000-Pound Great White Shark Captured in Great Lakes,"" June 22, 2017', 'https://notallowedto.com/great-white-shark-in-great-lakes/'), ('Phone interview with Christopher Yaw, spokesperson for District Nine Coast Guard, July 11, 2017', 'No link'), ('WorldNewsDailyReport.com, ""Fisherman captures 3,000-pound great white shark in great lakes,"" June 20, 2016', 'http://worldnewsdailyreport.com/fisherman-captures-3000-pound-great-white-shark-in-great-lakes/'), ('Snopes.com, ""Fisherman Captures 3,000-Pound Great White Shark in Great Lakes?""
