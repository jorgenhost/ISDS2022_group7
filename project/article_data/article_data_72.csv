Greene twists logic and facts in pedophilia charge against GOP senators
","Before we get to Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene‚Äôs misuse of a U.S. Supreme Court nomination to tar the records of three Republican senators, let‚Äôs establish their track records against child exploitation. In 2019, Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, co-sponsored and successfully passed a bill called the End Network Abuse Act. The legislation focused on rooting out child pornography within Defense Department computer systems. The National Center on Sexual Exploitation hailed the move as a victory against child exploitation. In 2018, Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, co-sponsored a law called Protecting Young Victims from Sexual Abuse. A response to the Olympic gymnastic sex abuse scandal, the measure reinforced the duty to report suspected abuse and increased the scope of penalties for child pornogrphy. When Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, ran for president in 2012, he vowed he would ramp up prosecutions and impose new barriers to all pornography. It was not a stance new for¬†him. ""If I am president, I will work to make sure that every computer sold into the home has an easy to engage pornography filter so that every parent can protect their child from unwanted filth,"" Romney said at a 2007 Values Voter summit. Even without this context, we and many other observers knew Greene was disconnected from reality when she tweeted April 4 that Sens. ""Murkowski, Collins, and Romney are pro-pedophile."" The three Republican senators had joined Democrats in a procedural vote to move forward with the Supreme Court nomination of Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. Greene‚Äôs office said Jackson has a history of ""showing leniency towards pedophiles."" In a career that spans a quarter of a century, Jackson has held many positions. She clerked for three federal judges, worked in private practice, and before she joined the U.S. Court of Appeals, she spent eight years as a federal district judge. When Jackson appeared before the Senate Judiciary Committee, several Republicans accused her of being ""soft"" on child pornography offenders, because she often issued sentences that were below what federal sentencing guidelines suggested and what prosecutors were seeking. We, along with other news organizations, found those accusations misleading. The federal guidelines in child pornography cases are outdated, and judges disregard them about 70% of the time. Judges also issue sentences shorter than what prosecutors request. Some conservative judges nominated under President Donald Trump have made that call. Jackson didn‚Äôt always opt for shorter sentences. For cases that included attempted or actual sexual abuse of a minor, Jackson generally agreed with prosecutors‚Äô recommendations. In one instance, she handed down a sentence that was eight years longer than what the guidelines recommended. Greene, a congresswoman from Georgia, took the view that supporting Jackson‚Äôs nomination amounts to being pro-pedophile. This mangles logic and language. The defendants were sent to jail. Once released, they had to live under oversight that restricted their movements and activities for 10 to 20 years. Punishing people does not equal supporting their crimes.¬† Greene said Murkowski, Collins and Romney are pro-pedophile. All three lawmakers have clear track records of moving against child exploitation, whether online or in person. Greene‚Äôs claim is beyond preposterous.

Did New York Gov. Kathy Hochul fire 35,000 health care workers?
","Even with a months-long easing in the coronavirus pandemic, vaccine mandates remain controversial in some quarters.¬† Rob Astorino, a Republican candidate for governor of New York, accused the woman he wants to oust, Democratic Gov. Kathy Hochul, of firing some 34,000 health care workers for not complying with vaccine mandates. In a tweet posted Jan. 20, Astorino said of Hochul that ""none of your mandates have helped beat ‚Äòthis surge.‚Äô"" Among other criticisms, Astorino‚Äôs tweet blamed Hochul for ""firing 34K HC workers.""

Under Hochul‚Äôs predecessor as governor, Democrat Andrew Cuomo, New York State health care workers were placed under a vaccine mandate. The mandate required health care workers to be vaccinated by Sept. 27, 2021.¬† On Oct. 5. Hochul ‚Äî who had been elevated to governor following Cuomo‚Äôs resignation ‚Äî extended the mandate to apply to workers in mental health and disability services. Under the new mandate, health care workers in these facilities had until Nov. 1 to get at least one vaccination.¬† The Astorino campaign said its tweet was based on New York State Health Department data showing that 33,982 health care workers were inactive because of the vaccine mandate. ""We believe Rob's claims are completely accurate,"" Phil Oliva, a spokesperson for the Astorio campaign, told us in an email. However, the Astorino campaign‚Äôs reading of the numbers was faulty. The New York State Health Department told PolitiFact New York that ""approximately 3% of health workers were furloughed, terminated, or opted to resign or retire."" Data released by Hochul‚Äôs office on Oct. 13 showed that the number of health care workers who had left their jobs was 33,982, but that the number who had specifically been fired was 10,555. That‚Äôs less than one-third of the total loss in health care workers. In public comments on Oct. 13, 2021, Hochul reiterated that the number of lost jobs were greater than just those who were fired. ""It includes people who were terminated, resignations, people deciding to retire, and people who are on furlough waiting to see the outcome of litigation"" against the mandate. In addition, it was up to employers, rather than the governor, to determine what happened to employees who did not comply, said Erin Silk, a spokesperson for the New York State Health Department. ""Those plans could include termination, but that was not required,"" Silk said. Astorino said Hochul‚Äôs record included ""firing"" 34,000 health care workers. About 34,000 health care workers in New York state did leave their job after the vaccine mandate was enacted. However, less than a third of those could be described as being due to ""firing."" About two-thirds of the lost jobs stemmed from resignations, retirements, or furloughs by employees waiting to see how litigation against the mandate played out.

Does the US lead in cutting greenhouse gases? It depends on how you look at it
","The latest United Nations climate change report had a grim forecast: If greenhouse gas emissions don‚Äôt peak within three years, then there‚Äôs little hope of limiting the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Alaska Republican Sen. Dan Sullivan says one of the best moves the United States could make is to speed up the shift in places like China and India from coal to natural gas. Sullivan has a plan to increase American natural gas production, liquify it and ship it overseas. His key supporting argument is the hefty 14% drop in American carbon dioxide emissions over the last 15 years. ""If every other country in the world had a record like this, where do you think we would be on global emissions?"" Sullivan said at a March 23 Senate hearing. ""We are the leader in the world by far."" Whether the U.S. is the world leader in cutting emissions depends on how you measure things. In total metric tons, Sullivan is right. But in relative terms, many economic peers achieved steeper declines.¬† At the Senate hearing, Sullivan displayed a chart showing the change in carbon dioxide emissions in nine countries between 2005 and 2020. The U.S. stands out with a fall between those years of 970 million metric tons of carbon dioxide. Japan‚Äôs emissions went down 237 million metric tons. China, on the other hand, released an additional 4,689 million metric tons in 2020 than it did in 2005, while India‚Äôs emissions rose 1,315 million metric tons. Chart used by Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, to show carbon dioxide emission trends for nine countries. (Office of Dan Sullivan) Sullivan‚Äôs staff pulled these numbers from the website Our World in Data, a reliable resource based at the University of Oxford in England. The numbers are accurate, although climate trackers warn against including 2020 numbers, because the COVID-19 economic shutdown distorted normal emission patterns. In our analysis, we looked at 2005 to 2019. The first caveat to Sullivan‚Äôs approach is that he uses absolute numbers. Rob Jackson, an earth systems professor at Stanford University, said the chart is ""conveniently misleading."" The United States has the largest reduction because, in 2005, Jackson said, it had the highest emissions. ""Other countries, in Europe in particular, have done far more than we have to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,"" Jackson said. Looking at the percentage change in carbon dioxide emissions, the United Kingdom made the greatest progress, with a reduction of 35%. Italy, France and Germany came next. The United States and Japan tied for fifth place with reductions of about 14%. ¬† Sullivan spokesman Ben Dietderich agreed that the relative changes reshuffled the rankings, but he countered that the absolute number of tons mattered most. It‚Äôs the tons of carbon dioxide that affect the global climate, he said. At the end of the day, Dietderich said, the United States made the largest contribution to reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Jackson raised another issue with Sullivan‚Äôs chart ‚Äî it left out emissions per person. China‚Äôs emissions are enormous, but the country also has 1.4 billion people. Viewed through that lens, despite the decline in U.S. emissions, the United States remained the larger emitter per capita. ""Our per capita emissions are still twice China‚Äôs and eight times higher than India‚Äôs,"" Jackson said. ¬† Sullivan‚Äôs focus on carbon dioxide doesn‚Äôt give the full picture of American emissions. There are other greenhouse gases, most importantly methane and nitrous oxide. The same website that provided the carbon dioxide numbers also has data for greenhouse gases across the board. Factoring in all greenhouse gases, the U.S. trends are less dramatic. The total decline goes from a reduction of 879 million metric tons to 607 million metric tons. As a percentage, the decline goes from 14.3% for carbon dioxide alone to 9.5% for all greenhouse gases combined. The numbers work that way because it doesn‚Äôt take much of those other gases to put a lot of carbon into the air. While natural gas was the single largest factor in cutting U.S. emissions, major contributions also came from the rise in wind power and efficiency gains in American industry that lowered demand. Sullivan‚Äôs point was that if other countries followed the United States‚Äô lead, global emissions would fall. Since the blossoming of natural gas production played a large role in the U.S., it makes sense, he said, to expand production further and export to coal-burning countries like China and India. Not so fast, say energy researchers. Michael Young, a senior scientist at the University of Texas at Austin, said building the pipelines and processing plants to send natural gas overseas adds carbon to the atmosphere. It‚Äôs possible, Young said, that exports to Asia could reduce emissions there if they replaced coal or wood. ""But it‚Äôs also true that liquified natural gas from the U.S. will embed carbon dioxide emissions in the production and transportation of the fuel, reducing the benefits,"" Young said. ""Whether the two balance out depends on many factors."" Ben King, a senior analyst at Rhodium Group, a private research center, said while industry is getting better at preventing the release of methane gas, it still happens in the liquefaction process. More troubling, King said, is that building new plants to export natural gas is a 30-year investment. ""Locking in long-lived fossil fuel assets runs directly counter to the need, recently affirmed in the latest International Panel on Climate Change report, to quickly transition away from uncontrolled fossil fuel use,"" King said. Sullivan said the United States is ""the leader in the world by far"" in cutting greenhouse gas emissions.¬† In absolute terms, that is accurate ‚Äì but it isn‚Äôt telling the full story. Relative to the scale of emissions in other leading economies, other countries show much deeper reductions. Sullivan also left out emissions per person in the United States. While those have gone down, they are still about twice as high as they are in China.¬† We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2022/apr/06/dan-sullivan/does-us-lead-cutting-greenhouse-gases-it-depends-h/

The FBI lost Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop? There‚Äôs no evidence of that
","For well over a year, we‚Äôve heard a lot about Hunter Biden‚Äôs abandoned laptop. Questions have swirled about its contents, whether it was really his and even whether it existed at all.¬† Now, after a cache of emails from the abandoned computer was verified by the New York Times and Washington Post, one claim suggests the FBI has lost the laptop. But a close look shows that conclusion is an overreach based on a confrontational exchange in a March 29 House hearing. In that Judiciary Committee hearing, which was held to discuss oversight of the FBI‚Äôs cyber division, U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., questioned Bryan Vorndran, the FBI assistant director for the¬†division, about the laptop‚Äôs whereabouts. Vorndran repeatedly told Gaetz he doesn‚Äôt know.

The video was flagged as part of Facebook‚Äôs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The exchange Trump referenced is not proof that the FBI lost or misplaced Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop, and recent reporting confirms that the laptop is in the bureau‚Äôs possession. While Vorndran says that he personally didn‚Äôt know where the laptop was, he didn‚Äôt say that the agency lost it. PolitiFact reached out to the FBI for comment but did not hear back. Trump‚Äôs team declined to comment.¬† Here is the exchange: Gaetz: ""So, where is it? The laptop?""¬† Vorndran: ""Sir, I‚Äôm not here to talk about the laptop. I‚Äôm here to talk about the FBI‚Äôs cyber program."" Gaetz: ""You are the assistant director of FBI cyber. I want to know where Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop is. Where is it?"" Vorndran: ""Sir, I don‚Äôt know that answer."" A few moments later, Gaetz says, ""I‚Äôm holding the receipt from Mac‚Äôs Computer Repair, where in December 2019 they turned over this laptop to the FBI, and now you‚Äôre telling me right here, that as the assistant director of FBI cyber you don‚Äôt know where this is after it was turned over to you three years ago?"" Vorndran: ""Yes, sir, that‚Äôs an accurate statement."" After Gaetz grills him further, Vorndran says the questions are not ""in the purview of his investigative responsibilities.""¬† We could find no credible reports about the FBI losing or misplacing the computer. A March 30 Washington Post story that details how the newspaper analyzed a copy of the laptop‚Äôs hard drive places it in the FBI‚Äôs possession.¬† ""The MacBook itself is now in the hands of the FBI, which is investigating whether Hunter Biden properly reported income from business dealings,"" the story says. Questions about the laptop first emerged in October 2020, after the New York Post reported that a computer that appeared to belong to Hunter Biden was dropped off at a repair shop in April 2019 in Delaware and had been shared with then-President Donald Trump‚Äôs personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani.¬† At the time, other news outlets were unable to verify the laptop‚Äôs existence or contents. In March 2022, however, the New York Times reported on an ongoing investigation into Hunter Biden‚Äôs taxes and acknowledged the legitimacy of the laptop through emails authenticated by people involved in the investigation. The Washington Post also authenticated thousands of emails from a copy of the computer‚Äôs hard drive with the help of security experts who examined the data. In none of this reporting is there a suggestion that the FBI has misplaced the laptop that they seized. Using video from a Congressional hearing as evidence, Donald Trump Jr. claimed that the FBI lost Hunter Biden‚Äôs laptop. That hearing was about the FBI‚Äôs cybersecurity division. Vorndran, an FBI official who was presenting, was questioned by Gaetz about the laptop. Discussion of the computer and its contents were not on the agenda for the day‚Äôs meeting. Vorndron responded that he did not know of the computer‚Äôs whereabouts and wasn‚Äôt there to talk about that matter. This does not amount to evidence of Trump‚Äôs claim.¬† There is no other indication that the computer, which was seized by the FBI, has been misplaced.

No proof that Pa. US Senate candidate John Fetterman has described himself as a democratic socialist
","Six weeks before Pennsylvania‚Äôs primary elections, a super PAC formed to support Democratic U.S. Rep. Conor Lamb attacked the other leading Democratic hopeful, Lt. Gov.

Penn Progress has not produced evidence that Fetterman called himself a democratic socialist. One TV station took down the ad after Fetterman‚Äôs lawyers called on it to do so. The ad cites NPR for this claim. On Nov. 28, 2020, NPR broadcast a story about Fetterman in which the reporter called Fetterman a ""self-described democratic socialist.""¬† On Dec. 6, 2021, NPR attached a correction: ""This story wrongly states that Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman is a ‚Äòself-described democratic socialist.‚Äô He is not."" The same day the super PAC‚Äôs ad was released, lawyers for Fetterman and his campaign called on television stations to take down the ad, calling it false and defamatory. ""Fetterman has never described himself as a ‚Äòdemocratic socialist,‚Äô"" their letter said. The letter referred to the NPR story and the correction. Fetterman‚Äôs campaign announced the same day that a Philadelphia TV station had taken down the ad. We reached out to Penn Progress but did not hear back.¬† Politico reporter Holly Otterbein tweeted that she asked the group for evidence to back its claim.¬† Otterbein wrote that the PAC referred her to a 2016 article in Public Opinion, a Pennsylvania newspaper, and a 2021 article in Forbes that called Fetterman a self-described democratic socialist, but no articles in which he‚Äôs quoted calling himself one. Both articles used the phrase, ""self-described democratic socialist."" On April 6, the Forbes article was updated: ""Correction: This story had incorrectly identified Fetterman as a ‚Äòdemocratic socialist‚Äô ‚Äî he is not."" Politico reported in December that Lamb referred to Fetterman as a socialist, but Lamb‚Äôs campaign did not provide any evidence.¬† On April 3, after a debate that Fetterman did not attend, Lamb said, according to the Washington Post: ""The socialist label sticks on John because of the policies he actually has advocated and the people like Bernie Sanders that he has actively campaigned with."" Fetterman endorsed Sanders in Sanders‚Äô 2016 presidential run. In 2016, an interviewer asked Fetterman: ""You are very progressive, I think ‚Äî I could be wrong but you label yourself as a democratic socialist?"" Fetterman replied: ""No, I don‚Äôt label myself a democratic socialist, but I certainly ran the most progressive campaign in my race this past spring.""¬† The Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and decided not to seek re-election.¬† Besides Fetterman and Lamb, the other major Democratic candidate is state Rep.

No, this California bill wouldn't allow mothers to kill their children after they're born
","The alarming news about a new California law came in the form of a headline shared on Facebook. ""California introduces new bill that would allow mothers to kill their babies up to 7 days after birth,"" read the screenshot headline above an image of a sleeping newborn, swaddled and cozy in a pink and blue knit hat. ""Democrats at it again,"" read the caption that accompanied the March 31 Facebook post. The post was flagged as part of Facebook‚Äôs efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the post would be shocking, it is wrong. California lawmakers are not seeking to legalize killing newborns. The claim was taken from a screenshot of a March 24 blog post that claimed that California lawmakers are working on an ""infanticide bill."" ""Under California AB 2223, a mother will be shielded from civil and criminal charges for any ‚Äòactions or omissions‚Äô related to her pregnancy,"" the post read. ""These actions include not only abortion in any stage of pregnancy, but also ‚Äòperinatal death.‚Äô Perinatal death is defined as the death of a newborn up to seven days or more."" Assembly Bill 2223 is a real bill ‚Äî but it would not legalize killing newborns in California. The bill intends to ensure that parents are not ""investigated, persecuted, or incarcerated for ending a pregnancy or experiencing pregnancy loss,"" said Erin Ivie, a spokesperson for Assembly Member Buffy Wicks, D-Oakland, the California legislator who introduced the bill. Broadly, the bill would end a requirement that a coroner must investigate deaths related to, or following, self-induced or criminal abortions. It would also prevent using a coroner‚Äôs statement on a certificate of fetal death to pursue a criminal or civil case. In addition, the bill would add the following language to the Health and Safety Code: ""Notwithstanding any other law, a person shall not be subject to civil or criminal liability or penalty, or otherwise deprived of their rights, based on their actions or omissions with respect to their pregnancy or actual, potential, or alleged pregnancy outcome, including miscarriage, stillbirth, or abortion, or perinatal death."" Ivie pointed to the cases of two California women, Chelsea Becker and Adora Perez. Both were prosecuted and incarcerated after delivering stillborn babies, because officials ruled that methamphetamine found in the fetuses‚Äô systems caused their deaths. A judge later dismissed Becker‚Äôs murder charge. And though Perez struck a plea agreement, a judge overthrew it and the resulting 11-year prison sentence, saying it was unlawful. In addition to avoiding such cases, Ivie said the bill is intended to protect parents who lose a baby after delivery as a result of a pregnancy-related issue. She provided a real-world example: A Long Island woman was pregnant when she was in a car wreck. She suffered severe injuries and her baby was delivered by emergency pre-term cesarean section. After living for a few days, the baby passed away. Prosecutors argued that they could charge the woman for her child‚Äôs death because it occurred after delivery, rather than in utero ‚Äî and because she hadn‚Äôt been wearing a seatbelt. They also said she had used drugs and alcohol that contributed to the crash. The woman was convicted of manslaughter, but that conviction was overturned in 2015. These false claims appear to arise out of the ambiguity of the term ""perinatal."" Depending on the source consulted, the adjective ""perinatal"" has different meanings: Merriam-Webster: ""Occurring in, concerned with, or being in the period around the time of birth."" Dictionary.com: ""Occurring during or pertaining to the phase surrounding the time of birth, from the 20th week of gestation to the 28th day of newborn life."" The National Institute of Mental Health: ""The time before and after the birth of a child."" The U.K. National Health Service: ""The period of time when you become pregnant and up to a year after giving birth."" For the purposes of Wicks‚Äô bill, Ivie said, ""the perinatal stage is the period following pregnancy, and it is currently undefined when it comes to duration."" Ivie told PolitiFact, however, that Wicks amended the language of the bill to specify that it would only prevent people from being prosecuted if a perinatal death occurred ""due to a pregnancy-related cause.""¬† Khiara M. Bridges, a law professor at UC Berkeley School of Law, said that perinatal is not a ""legal term of art,"" so it does not have a set meaning across several different laws. It would be helpful for lawmakers to define ""perinatal"" as it is used in the bill, Bridges said.¬†¬† She said that Wicks‚Äô proposed amendment should clarify that the bill is not meant to protect people who intentionally kill their newborn babies.¬† ""If the text is amended to say a ‚Äòperinatal death due to a pregnancy-related cause,‚Äô it means that the fetus died because of some complication due to the pregnancy, as opposed to an action that the pregnant person or anyone else took to cause the fetal death,"" Bridges said. If there were any ambiguity in the law, a judge would likely be tapped to help interpret the meaning of the statute, Bridges said.¬† ""A judge would be hard-pressed to interpret that language as protecting a person who kills their baby up to seven days after birth intentionally,"" she said. ""One of the tools judges would use in that case is legislative intent."" Wicks said that claims that her bill would legalize murdering newborns were ""absurd and disingenuous."" ""No person should face prison time for a tragic pregnancy outcome, and this bill will ensure that prosecutions and investigations have no place in reproductive health care,"" Wicks said. A post claimed a proposed California bill ""would allow mothers to kill their babies up to 7 days after birth."" It does not. The bill is meant to ensure that people are not investigated, prosecuted or incarcerated for ending a pregnancy, experiencing pregnancy loss or for losing a baby after it is born due to pregnancy-related causes, according to the lawmaker who introduced it. A judge would use that legislative intent to help interpret any ambiguity in the law if it were passed.

Democratic ad exaggerates GOP embrace and scope of Scott's proposal on Social Security, Medicare
","An 11-point agenda proposed by Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., continues to produce fodder for attack ads from Democrats. Scott‚Äôs plan, which he pitched as a platform for the GOP should the party take back Congress in November, indicated support for raising income taxes on millions of Americans by saying that all Americans should pay some income tax, and half don‚Äôt. Democrats like Rep. Val Demings teed up the plan to falsely tag Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., as supporting Scott‚Äôs pitch. Demings is running for Rubio‚Äôs Senate seat. Now the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee ‚Äî the direct rival to the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee that Scott chairs ‚Äî is going after another plank of Scott‚Äôs plan. Its 30-second TV ad uses clips from a Fox News interview of Scott. The anchor questions Scott about how the plan would raise taxes and ""potentially sunset"" programs such as Social Security and Medicare. Then these words appear on the ad‚Äôs screen: ""SENATE REPUBLICANS‚Äô PLAN ‚Äî END SOCIAL SECURITY"" ""SENATE REPUBLICANS‚Äô PLAN ‚Äî END MEDICARE"" ¬† Claims that Social Security and Medicare are imperiled are common during election campaigns. The DSCC attack goes too far in framing Scott‚Äôs idea as a broadly supported death sentence for Medicare and Social Security. The first thing to know is that Scott‚Äôs plan, released Feb. 22, was proposed by him ‚Äî not a group of Senate Republicans. Leading Republicans such as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky quickly panned parts of it. The next is that it didn‚Äôt directly call for ending those programs as the ad bottom-lined. It calls for all federal legislation to sunset within five years. That leaves open the possibility of those programs ending were Congress not to approve them again.¬† In rejecting Scott‚Äôs proposal, McConnell said, ""We will not have as part of our agenda a bill that raises taxes on half the American people and sunsets Social Security and Medicare within five years."" Scott‚Äôs plan mentions Social Security and Medicare once, in a section labeled Government Reform/Debt: ""Force Congress to issue a report every year telling the public what they plan to do when Social Security and Medicare go bankrupt."" The plan also says: ""All federal legislation sunsets in five years. If a law is worth keeping, Congress can pass it again."" The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service says ""the sunset concept provides for programs and agencies to terminate automatically on a periodic basis unless explicitly renewed by law."" Under Scott‚Äôs plan, all federal laws, including those creating Social Security and Medicare, would expire after five years. Congress would have to renew the laws it wants to keep. As the New York Times reported: ""Taken literally, that would leave the fate of Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to the whims of a Congress that rarely passes anything so expansive."" As PolitiFact Wisconsin reported, Scott‚Äôs statement was generic and did not directly call for the phasing out of either program.¬† The DSCC ad cites a news story that points out that Social Security and Medicare would be ended only if the laws creating them were not renewed. Scott in the past has raised concerns about the impact of the two programs on the federal debt. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee claimed that the ""Senate Republicans‚Äô plan"" would ""end Social Security"" and ""end Medicare."" The ad refers not to a plan from Senate Republicans but from one Republican, Scott. The plan would sunset all federal laws after five years, requiring Congress to renew the laws it wants to keep. Federal sunsetting provides for programs to terminate automatically on a periodic basis unless they are explicitly renewed by law. While there is an element of truth in that these social welfare programs could be phased out in Scott‚Äôs model, the DSCC claim overreaches by painting that uncertain outcome as a broad party position, giving voters a misleading impression.

","The Russian invasion of Ukraine has sparked another baseless internet rumor, this time about the alleged capture of a top NATO leader in Mariupol, Ukraine. ""Unconfirmed sources from Russia Military: The Russian army captured the U.S Major General Roger L.

Pfizer did not bribe the FDA for approval of its COVID-19 vaccine
","Some social media users are falsely describing a document showing a $2.8 million payment from Pfizer to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a ""bribe"" for approval of the company‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine. ""$2.8 million bribe payment from Pfizer to FDA for their Bioweapon ‚Äòapproval.‚Äô You‚Äôre not supposed to know that. Look the other way,"" reads an April 2 tweet.¬† The tweet includes a photo of a document with a line at the bottom that reads: ""A wire transfer of $2,875,842.00 was made to the U.S. Department of Treasury. (TREAS),"" before cutting off.¬† Several other Twitter users make the same claim. The payment was not a bribe, but rather an application fee required under a 30-year-old law for any drugmaker seeking FDA approval of their products. The Prescription Drug User Fee Act was signed into law in 1992 and has been reauthorized every five years. It allows the FDA to collect fees from pharmaceutical companies ""that produce certain human drug and biological products,"" and helps the agency streamline the approval process, the FDA website says. (The law is due for reauthorization again this year.) ""User fees provide instrumental funding for the FDA‚Äôs independent review of medical products that make a difference in the lives of all Americans, without compromising the agency‚Äôs commitment to scientific integrity, public health and regulatory standards, patient safety, and transparency,"" FDA spokesperson Abby Capobianco wrote in a statement to PolitiFact. The FDA‚Äôs fiscal year 2021 budget was $6.1 billion. Industry user fees paid about 46% of the budget; the federal budget authorization covered the other 54%. A spokesperson for Pfizer also confirmed that the $2.8 million mentioned in the tweets was a required Prescription Drug User Fee Act payment. The FDA released the document as part of an ongoing Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, said Capobianco. The lawsuit seeking the documents came from a group called the Public Health and Medical Professionals for Transparency. That group, which MedPage Today reports has several members known for spreading false information during the pandemic, sued the FDA in September for the release of COVID-19 vaccine review documents.¬† The photo shared by some on social media only shows the first page of the six-page document, and ends in mid-sentence, cutting off the portion that states the payment is for a ""user fee."" The payment shown in the May 6, 2021 document, matches the 2021 rates posted on an FDA webpage for applications that are required to present clinical data. In August 2021, the FDA gave Pfizer‚Äôs COVID-19 vaccine full approval for use in people ages 16 and older. ""The public can be very confident that this vaccine meets the high standards for safety, effectiveness, and manufacturing quality the FDA requires of an approved product,"" then-Acting FDA Commissioner Janet Woodcock said in August. Social media users are saying a document recently released by the FDA shows that Pfizer paid the agency a $2.8 million ""bribe"" for approval of its COVID-19 vaccine. But those posts mislead by sharing a truncated version of the letter that describes a user fee. Those fees are paid to the FDA under the Prescription Drug User Fee Act.

Russia pushes false crisis actor claims about video from Bucha, Ukraine
","Ukrainian officials accused Russia of a massacre in a city outside of Kyiv, claiming they found hundreds of dead people after Russian forces withdrew from the area. ""This is genocide,"" Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy told CBS News. The Russian Ministry of Defense denied responsibility as it has with previous attacks, saying in a post on Telegram that the photographs and videos coming out of Bucha, Ukraine, ""are another hoax, a staged production and provocation by the Kiev regime for the Western media."" Across Telegram, Twitter and other platforms, Russian officials pushing that claim shared a video showing footage taken from a car as it steered through a street strewn with bodies. A Telegram post shared by the Russian Ministry of Defense, and reshared by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, falsely claimed that a video from Ukraine‚Äôs Expreso TV showed abnormalities that proved the people were ""deliberately laid out to create a more dramatic picture."" (The videos contain sensitive and graphic content.) ""The video of the bodies is confusing,"" the Russian defense ministry wrote in the post, which included a slowed-down version of the video. ""Here at the 12th second the ‚Äòcorpse‚Äô on the right is moving his arm. At 30th second in the rear view mirror the ‚Äòcorpse‚Äô sits down.""

Russian agencies and officials posted false claims about a video captured from Bucha, Ukraine, on social media. But the claims are false.¬† The video from Expreso TV, available on the station‚Äôs YouTube channel, does not show one of the people moving an arm. Instead, journalists and social media debunkers revealed that it shows a mark ‚Äî perhaps a droplet of water or a speck of dirt ‚Äî moving across the car‚Äôs windshield. One Twitter account inverted the coloring of the video to show more clearly that the person on the ground lies still as the speck moves across the windshield. BBC News posted a version of the video that is edited to show the mark circled in red, along with other similar marks. The Expreso TV video does not show a corpse sitting up in the car‚Äôs passenger-side mirror, either. As BBC News‚Äô disinformation reporter Shayan Sardarizadeh tweeted, the dead body appears as though it is sitting in the mirror because the mirror's shape has a distorting effect. The buildings in the background also appear distorted. PolitiFact asked an expert in physics and optical sciences about the video. He said the same thing: that the alleged movement is due to the mirror‚Äôs effects. ""I've looked at the videos in the links you sent and can see no evidence whatsoever that the corpse either moved its arm or sat up,"" said Charles M.

Benjamin Strick, the director of investigations at the Center for Information Resilience and a contributor at Bellingcat, found YouTube videos posted by the Guardian and Al Jazeera that show additional angles.

Abbott referred to installed capacity in the grid, not power available during severe winter weather
","As temperatures dropped in early February and Texans braced for severe winter weather, state officials assured the public the power grid was better prepared to handle¬†freezing temperatures¬†compared to 2020. In a Feb. 3¬†news conference, Gov. Greg Abbott listed the reasons why he believed Texans should have confidence in the grid:¬†""As compared to last year, Texas has about 15% more power generation capacity."" Seasonal data from grid operator Electric Reliability Council of Texas indicates available generation capacity is at 85,000 megawatts for¬†winter 2021-2022, up from 83,000 megawatts in winter 2020-2021. That¬†comes out to be¬†a 2% increase. So where did Abbott get 15%? Abbott's office referred PolitiFact Texas to the¬†Texas Public Utility Commission, which¬†oversees ERCOT. According to ERCOT and PUC officials,¬†the 15% cited by Abbott describes an increase in¬†total installed capacity¬†from 102,874 megawatts in winter 2020 to 118,257 megawatts in winter 2021. Total installed capacity refers to the maximum amount of power that can be generated under ideal conditions. ""That's just if everything we had on the grid was operating at its full output. That's what it could make,"" said Joshua Rhodes,¬†research associate at the University of Texas at Austin Energy Institute and Webber Energy Group. However, at any given time, the grid isn't producing at 100% potential, experts told PolitiFact Texas. For example, the sun isn't always shining for solar energy, or the wind isn't always blowing for wind energy, Doug Lewin, energy consultant and¬†president of Stoic Energy Consulting,¬†said as example. ""It's sort of¬†more of a theoretical potential,"" Lewin said. ""There is no resource that has a 100% operational capacity,"" Lewin said.¬†""That does not exist, but generally thermal plants have a higher operational capacity. But when you start to put together enough wind and solar, and they're spread out across a broad enough geographic area, their overall capacity factors or operational capacity increases."" Rhodes also said a lot of the capacity added in the last year included wind and solar, which would not operate at 100% capacity all the time. ""We don't expect all the wind and all the solar to be available during a winter peak event,"" Rhodes said. ERCOT officials said in February that the grid has a¬†total generating capacity at about 86,000 megawatts if needed, the¬†American-Statesman reported¬†then. The value Abbott cited described what the grid is capable of creating, though the amount of available power might be less than total installed capacity. ""I don't think there's anything wrong with saying we added a whole lot of capacity in the last year,"" Lewin said. Aidan Tuohy, program manager of Grid Operations and Planning at the research and¬†development firm¬†Electric Power Research Institute, said resource adequacy assessments have processes to account for wind patterns and sunlight¬†in its seasonal estimates. ""One, that let's say ERCOT used, they¬†look¬†at historical performance and then take either an average during stressful conditions, or some other statistical measure during stressful conditions,"" Tuohy said.¬†""And then another way to do that is to actually simulate¬†operations.¬†For example, in California, they simulate a thousand different patterns of generator outages and wind and solar patterns based on historical data and then¬†try to come up with what the expected observed load will be."" ERCOT included¬†risk assessments for thermal resources based on historical information, Tuohy also noted. As Texas braced for the effects of cold weather, Abbott assured Texans: ""Compared to last year, Texas has about 15% more power generation capacity."" Experts say Abbott¬†was referring to the total¬†installed capacity if power generation infrastructure were running at 100% capacity. However, that is a theoretical figure.¬†Instead, stations generate¬†at a fraction of the total installed capacity. The amount of available power¬†in an emergency situation would be less than the¬†installed capacity.

Scott Walker left women with 'nowhere to turn' by defunding Planned Parenthood, Hillary Clinton says
","Well before the release of videos that ignited debate about the sale of fetal body parts, Republican Gov. Scott Walker boasted about defunding Planned Parenthood in Wisconsin. In a video of her own released Aug. 3, 2015, Hillary Clinton attacked Walker‚Äôs move. ""When politicians talk about defunding Planned Parenthood, they're talking about blocking millions of women, men and young people from life-saving, preventive care, cancer screenings, breast exams, birth control. They're talking about cutting people off from the health care provider they know and trust,"" Clinton said. ""Unfortunately, these attacks aren't new; they're more of the same. We've seen them in Wisconsin, where Governor Walker defunded Planned Parenthood and left women across the state stranded with nowhere else to turn."" The claim by the leading Democratic contender for the White House runs counter to statements made by Walker, who has said during his presidential campaign that he simply transferred money from Planned Parenthood to other organizations. What we found is that when it comes to cancer screenings, breast exams and birth control, women in some parts of the state -- particularly those with lower incomes -- lost their local health care provider and might have to travel much farther for services. That‚Äôs because Planned Parenthood shut down five facilities after losing the state funding. At the same time, the closures were done in only certain parts of the state. And it goes too far to say the former Planned Parenthood patients have ""nowhere else to turn,"" given that they were referred to other providers -- albeit, in some cases, providers outside their home community. Defunding in Wisconsin Clinton‚Äôs campaign cited a number of news articles that detailed the defunding as well as the fallout. We went to a Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin leader to fill us in further. Nicole Safar told us the group was getting public funding for family planning services (but none for abortion services) from three sources: a direct federal grant and from Medicaid, both of which continue; and from the state, in the form of an annual grant. Walker ""defunded"" Planned Parenthood by taking aim at the only source he controlled. In his first state budget, for 2011-‚Äô13, Walker proposed eliminating $1.9 million per year in state grants for family planning activities such as contraceptive services and supplies, pregnancy testing and cervical cancer screening. About $1 million of that had been going to nine Planned Parenthood clinics, with the rest given primarily to other private organizations and county health departments. In analyzing Walker‚Äôs proposal, the Legislative Fiscal Bureau, the state‚Äôs nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, said the potential effects were unclear. The clinics losing the state funding would have to replace those dollars or change their operations. On the other hand, most of the revenues generated for the services that those clinics provided came from sources other than the state. Before adopting the 2011-‚Äô13 budget, the Legislature rejected Walker‚Äôs proposal to eliminate the $1.9 million in grants. Instead, it reduced the amount to $1.7 million. But it also changed state law so that any agency that provides abortion services could not receive the money. That meant Planned Parenthood lost its $1 million-per-year allocation. Over roughly the next three years, Planned Parenthood closed five of the nine clinics that had been receiving the state money -- in Fond du Lac, Beaver Dam, Johnson Creek, Chippewa Falls and Shawano. (Currently, Planned Parenthood has a total of 22 health facilities in Wisconsin.) Safar told us that some 3,000 patients who had used the clinics that were shut down were referred to other facilities, but those women typically had to travel farther to get services. For example, women using the Planned Parenthood clinic in Shawano, which had been open for 34 years, were referred to a facility in Green Bay -- nearly 40 miles away. Most of the patients received discounted services because of their income. ""There just aren‚Äôt providers on every corner willing to take low-income patients,"" Safar said. Kim Mueller, director of the Fond du Lac County Health Department, told us that lower-income women seeking birth control or treatment for sexually transmitted diseases were particularly affected by the closure of the Planned Parenthood clinic in Fond du Lac. ""Planned Parenthood was amazing -- you could walk in and get care right away,"" she said. Though there still are Planned Parenthood facilities in neighboring counties, and some local physicians accept low-income patients, some women are less likely to get birth control or STD treatment if they have to travel longer distances and start relationships with new providers, Mueller said. It‚Äôs important to note that the reduced amount of state funding for family planning services -- $1.7 million -- was still allocated for family planning and the other services Clinton cited. And Walker‚Äôs campaign pointed out that the state has continued to fund another program that pays for mammograms, Pap tests and other health screenings. Our rating Clinton said Walker's defunding of Planned Parenthood ""left women across the state stranded with nowhere else to turn"" for cancer screenings, breast exams and birth control. Walker in 2011 eliminated all state funding to Planned Parenthood, which in turn closed five clinics over the next three years. The loss of those clinics meant women were referred to other facilities, in some cases a considerable distance away, in order to continue getting services. But Clinton‚Äôs statement goes too far in that Walker‚Äôs move affected only some parts of the state and it‚Äôs wrong to say women in those areas have ""nowhere else to turn.""

Rubio says Hillary Clinton in government longer than any Republican running
","Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says the electorate should pick a candidate based on more than his or her resume. At the first prime-time debate for the 2016 Republican presidential primary, Rubio said he‚Äôs qualified even though he doesn‚Äôt have executive experience. ""This election cannot be a resume competition,"" he said. ""It‚Äôs important to be qualified, but if this election is going to be a resume competition, then Hillary Clinton's going to be the next president, because she's been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight."" Does Democratic frontrunner and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton really have a longer government resume than all 17 candidates on the GOP side? If you only count Clinton‚Äôs years as a U.S. senator (2001-08) and and a secretary of state (2009-13), then Clinton has 12 years in office, and that‚Äôs easily outpaced by many of the GOP candidates. Rubio is likely counting her time as first lady of the United States, from 1993-2000, when she had a more formal role with her own administrative office and a voice in national policy discussions. While counting her First Lady years is debatable -- it‚Äôs not an elected or appointed office -- counting it would bring her total to about 20 years. If you counted her time as first lady of Arkansas from 1979-80 and 1983-92, that would bring the total to 31 years. (Clinton had a private position as a lawyer for the Rose Law Firm during much of this time, so it‚Äôs not equivalent to the responsibilities of first lady of the United States.) We think it‚Äôs a stretch to count the Arkansas years, so we would put Clinton‚Äôs experience at about 20 years. As we‚Äôll see, there are several Republicans who have 20 years or more in public office. Among Republicans, there are three candidates who have no government experience: real estate mogul Donald Trump, former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina and neurosurgeon Ben Carson. Then there are the candidates who do not have at least 12 years in public office (the number of years Clinton has, minus her years as first lady): former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Virginia Gov. James Gilmore, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., and Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. That leaves the candidates who have at least 12 years of experience: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee: 14 years In 1993, he became Arkansas‚Äô lieutenant governor. He served as the state‚Äôs governor from 1996 through the beginning of 2007. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie: 17 years From 1994-98, he held a county-level representative position in New Jersey. He returned to government as New Jersey‚Äôs U.S. attorney from 2002-08, and he won election for governor in 2010. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal: 17 years Jindal held various administrative positions in Louisiana and at the national level from 1996 through 2003. He then served in the U.S. House from 2005 through 2008, when he was elected governor. Rubio: 17 years experience In 2000, he joined the Florida House of Representatives after two years as a city commissioner in West Miami, Fla. He has served in the U.S. Senate since the 2010 election. Former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa.: 20 years Santorum held various state-level positions from 1981-86. Then, he served in the U.S. House from 1991 through 1995 and then the Senate through the beginning of 2007. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker: 22 years In 1993, he became a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly. In 2002, Walker became Milwaukee County Executive. He has served as governor since winning election in 2010. Former New York Gov. George Pataki: 25 years Pataki was mayor of Peekskill, N.Y., from 1981 through 1984, then he served in the New York State legislature from 1985 through 1994. He served as governor 1995 through 2006. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C.: 28 years Graham had state and local attorney positions from 1988-94. He served in the South Carolina House of Representatives from 1993-95, when he entered the national House. He became a senator in 2003. Ohio Gov. John Kasich: 30 years In 1979, Kasich joined the Ohio Senate at age 26, following two years as a Senate aide. He served in the U.S. House of Representatives from 1983 through 2001. After time in the private sector, he became governor in 2011. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry: 30 years In 1984, Perry was elected to the Texas House of Representatives. He became the state‚Äôs agriculture commissioner in 1990, lieutenant governor in 1998 and governor from 2000 through 2014. Our ruling Rubio said that Clinton has ""been in office and in government longer than anybody else running here tonight."" The only way Rubio gets near this is to count her years as first lady of Arkansas, which we think is a stretch.

In 2009, former House Speaker Rubio launched what began as an uphill battle against Crist -- then the Republican governor -- for a U.S. Senate seat. Crist‚Äôs relationship with his party soured over time, and in April 2010, Crist ditched the GOP and became an independent. Rubio ended up winning the race, beating both Crist and Democrat Kendrick Meek. A couple years later, Crist became a Democrat and lost his race against Republican Gov. Rick Scott in 2014. (Now he is weighing a run for Congress in 2016 in Pinellas County.) Trump did donate to Crist in the 2010 Senate race and hosted fundraisers for him. The caveat is that Crist was still a Republican at the time. A Rubio spokesman sent us Federal Election Commission reports showing two donations Trump made to Crist‚Äôs campaign in 2009: $2,400 on Oct. 16 and $2,400 on Nov. 17. Trump hosted a fundraiser for Crist at his Mar-a-Lago estate in Palm Beach on Dec. 11, 2009, and a fundraiser in July 2009 in Long Island. Both events called for at least $1,000 donations. The Broward/Palm Beach New Times wrote that the Long Island fundraiser was a party hosted by Trump as well as Jill Zarin, one of the stars of Bravo TV‚Äôs The Real Housewives of New York City and a friend of Crist‚Äôs wife, Carole Rome. ""Let's hope Crist doesn't choke on his sirloin if Trump brings up any of his condo projects in South Florida,"" New Times wrote. ""Buyers in the Trump International Hotel & Tower in Fort Lauderdale would surely be pleased to know that their governor and would-be senator is getting so much dough from the millionaire many of them are now suing."" Trump also supported Crist prior to 2010. The Tampa Bay Times wrote in 2005 that Trump was slated to host a fundraiser at Trump Towers in Manhattan for Crist‚Äôs 2006 run for governor. The Times reported that Crist was introduced to Trump at a charity benefit in 1998 and then met with him in New York in May 2005 to discuss his candidacy. ""He could not have been more gracious or more hospitable,"" Crist said at the time. ""The guy cares about Florida. He has a residence in Florida and spends a lot of time in Florida."" We emailed spokespersons for Trump on debate night and did not get a reply. Our ruling Rubio said Trump ""supported Charlie Crist"" rather than Rubio. During the 2010 Senate race in Florida, Trump gave Crist $4,800. Trump also hosted two fundraisers for Crist that year, and Crist met with Trump to huddle about a prospective campaign as early as 2005. The only caveat, in the context of an exchange about Trump‚Äôs imperfect party loyalty, is that Crist was a Republican at the time.

Obamacare 'robbed' Medicare of $700B, says Huckabee
","Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee accused ""illegals, prostitutes, pimps, (and) drug dealers"" of freeloading off the Social Security system during the Aug. 6 GOP primary debate. Huckabee's provocative comment concluded a wonkish back-and-forth between him and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie about entitlement reform. Christie defended his plan to raise the retirement age and change benefits for Social Security and Medicare, but Huckabee stressed that Uncle Sam was to blame. ""If Congress wants to mess with the retirement program, why don't we let them start by changing their retirement program, and not have one, instead of talking about getting rid of Social Security and Medicare that was robbed $700 billion to pay for Obamacare?"" Huckabee said. This claim -- that the Affordable Care Act is funded by plundering the health care program of seniors -- is an old Republican talking point, dating back to the 2010 midterm elections. We‚Äôve checked out many versions of this claim, which contains some truth but is misleading. Obamacare doesn‚Äôt literally ""rob"" Medicare. But the Affordable Care Act does include provisions that reduce future increases in Medicare spending. In other words, the law slows down the rising costs of Medicare. It‚Äôs also important to note that the savings come at the expense of insurers and hospitals, not beneficiaries. (The $700 billion figure is also old, from a 2012 report by the Congressional Budget Office. It‚Äôs now updated to about $800 billion.) Under President George W. Bush, private insurers began to run a subset of Medicare plans with the idea that more competition produced lower costs. However, those plans grew to cost more than traditional Medicare, so the Affordable Care Act pared down the payments to private insurers. Hospitals would also find their checks docked when they failed to to meet benchmarks for patient care. On the flip side, the Affordable Care Act also funds illness prevention benefits, expands preventive care benefits, and provides $48 billion for prescription coverage. It‚Äôs possible that some beneficiaries could experience additional costs, reductions in service, or fewer hospitals that accept Medicare. ""While ‚Äòrobbed‚Äô is a bit loaded, the idea that Medicare beneficiaries are getting less generous benefits in order that the ACA can offer health benefits to younger people isn‚Äôt outrageous,"" said Andrew Biggs, resident scholar at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. But that‚Äôs a potential impact and a less direct effect of Obamacare than the claim suggests. The prior critiques of the claim ""remain relevant,"" the head of Medicare and Medicaid under George H.W. Bush told PolitiFact in 2014. Our ruling Huckabee said, ""$700 billion was robbed (from Medicare) to fund Obamacare."" It‚Äôs an old claim and an old figure. The law does reduce Medicare spending, but not in the way Huckabee suggests. The Affordable Care Act aims to cut future Medicare costs by reducing payments to private insurers and hospitals, not beneficiaries, though this could indirectly squeeze beneficiaries. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/07/mike-huckabee/obamacare-robbed-medicare-700-billion-says-huckabe/

Trump: Illegal immigration wasn't on anyone's mind before he entered the race
","Donald Trump‚Äôs signature self confidence was on full display at the first Republican debate. He was the sole candidate on the stage who refused to pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee. When Fox News moderator Chris Wallace challenged him to provide evidence to back up his claim that the Mexican government is intentionally sending criminals across the border, Trump had this rebuttal. ""If it weren‚Äôt for me, you wouldn‚Äôt even be talking about illegal immigration, Chris,"" Trump said. ""You wouldn‚Äôt even be talking about it. This wasn‚Äôt a subject that was on anybody‚Äôs mind until I brought it up at my announcement."" In light of the prominent role immigration has played in the Republican Party, that is a bold assertion. We decided to see what the record says. We attacked this in two ways. Since Trump directed his comment at Wallace, we looked at the transcripts from Wallace‚Äôs show, Fox News Sunday. We also cast a wider net by searching the Nexis database of major newspaper articles. Both approaches show Trump has an exaggerated sense of his role in the Republican primary. Chris Wallace  Trump made his presidential announcement speech on June 16, 2015. In the seven broadcasts of Fox News Sunday before that day, immigration policy came up in five shows. Wallace himself raised the issue with Republican candidates Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, and in the context of a discussion about former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush. Substitute hosts for Wallace also talked about immigration policy. In the seven broadcasts after Trump‚Äôs announcement speech, immigration policy again came up five times. In fairness to Trump, often this was in reference to the billionaire from New York. For example, when Wallace had another GOP contender on his show, former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, he asked him this: ""You have done more than just fire back on Trump on the issue of immigration. You devoted a major speech to Donald Trump in which you accused him of a, quote, ‚Äòtoxic mix of demagoguery, mean-spiritedness and nonsense.‚Äô "" So Trump has been a focus of conversation, but on Wallace‚Äôs show, the topic of immigration reform came up just as often before Trump announced as afterward. Major newspapers We used the Lexis-Nexis database to count the number of times illegal immigration or undocumented immigrants came up in major newspapers in the days before and after Trump‚Äôs announcement on June 16. For the curious, it has been 51 days since Trump jumped into the race for the White House. We compared the number of mentions in that period to those during the 51 days prior to his announcement. This table shows the tally for mentions of two terms -- ""undocumented"" and ""illegal immigrant"" -- within 10 words of the word ""president."" Date range Search term Number of articles April 25 to June 15 Undocumented 65 June 16 to Aug. 6 Undocumented 42 April 25 to June 15 Illegal immigrant 60 June 16 to Aug. 6 Illegal immigrant 79 Source: Lexis-Nexis So, the topic of undocumented immigrants came up more often before Trump announced his run through this lens.Articles using the term ""illegal immigrant"" appeared slightly less often before he gave his speech, but mentions were still relatively common -- and certainly not zero. Our ruling Trump said that if it weren‚Äôt for him, Wallace in particular and the media in general wouldn‚Äôt be talking about illegal immigration. The numbers tell a very different story. For Wallace and his Fox News show itself, the topic came up just as frequently before Trump announced as afterward. For mentions in major newspapers, the pattern is somewhat mixed, but mentions were common before Trump announced. There‚Äôs no doubt Trump‚Äôs bombastic comments brought additional attention to the issue, but the issue was on the minds of the media -- and politicians -- before Trump entered the fray. But Trump stated that the topic would not be on the table at all if not for him. That is clearly not the case.

Claim overstates film industry's impact on Georgia economy
","Superheroes and zombies apparently bring serious coin into the Peach State. The ""Ant-Man"" movie, and ""The Walking Dead"" TV series were among 248 productions shot in Georgia in the fiscal year that ended June 30, according to the state Department of Economic Development. The direct spending in Georgia was $1.7 billion, but the headline had an even more eye-popping number. The productions ""generated an economic impact of more than $6 billion,"" the department said. For political junkies, that‚Äôs about the cost of the national 2012 election according to our friends at the Center for Responsive Politics. So do productions really have as much impact in Georgia as all the spending in a contested presidential year nationwide? PolitiFact Georgia couldn‚Äôt resist looking further. Georgia‚Äôs Red Carpet Georgia has heavily incentivized the entertainment industry since 2008 to lure projects. Production companies can earn a 20 percent income tax credit on in-state costs of projects worth at least $500,000. Another 10 percent credit is given for using a Georgia logo in production credits. One unique element of the credit: if a production company doesn‚Äôt need to use it against its Georgia tax liability, it can sell the credit to another Georgia company to help finance a project. Those breaks have become even more attractive as other states, such as North Carolina, have cut back on their incentives. The result: a 553 percent increase in spending from 2008‚Äôs tally of $260.4 million spent on production in Georgia, according to Stefanie Paupeck Harper, spokeswoman for the state Department of Economic Development. The impact As head of the Georgia Film, Music and Digital Entertainment Office, Lee Thomas is responsible for certifying what productions can claim the state‚Äôs tax credit. But the way the state estimates the overall impact of that direct spending predates her 19-year tenure. For at least 30 years, the state economic development department has multiplied direct spending by 3.57 to estimate impact. In economic terms, that is a multiplier, or how many times each dollar of direct spending cycles through direct spending. In the film industry‚Äôs case, that means the state calculates that every dollar of direct spending has generated total spending of $3.57 in Georgia. Looking back to 2008, the state used the multiplier to calculate the film industry‚Äôs impact at $465 million. That is an astonishing 1,190 percent jump on impact. Thomas acknowledged that the state doesn‚Äôt know what sorts of spending that multiplier originally counted, or why the 3.57 estimate was used. But keeping the same multiplier allows to track progress over time, comparing apples to apples, she said. And it‚Äôs clear the more productions mean more local spending on gear, costumes, heating and air conditioning on set and location fees. ""If they spend on a caterer, that goes into the 3.57,"" Thomas said. ""Another thing we look at is film tourism, which is very hard to quantify but we know that those visitors are a direct result of the industry filming here. We certainly know that Georgia has seen significant growth in this industry."" Economics 101 Bruce Seaman is sympathetic to the growth argument. But as an economist at the Andrew Young School of Public Policy at Georgia State University, he knows the multiplier the state is using is way too high. The common IMPLAN model gives the industry a 1.83 multiplier. Using the state‚Äôs method, that would translate into a far lower impact of $3.1 billion. It‚Äôs significant, to be sure. But even that high number is likely overstated, because the state has not determined its capture rate. That is, for every $1 million a production company pays a big star ‚Äì or $100,000 spent on hotel rooms ‚Äì how much is captured in Georgia before the money goes back to the celebrity‚Äôs L.A. home or the hotel‚Äôs out-of-state headquarters? ""I want to know what it means to say, ‚Äòthat money was spent in the state,‚Äô"" Seaman said. And, a more detailed analysis would also benefit the state‚Äôs case of impact. That‚Äôs because the state doesn‚Äôt capture the long-term money invested from the boom, such as the erection of the new Pinewood Studios facility in Fayette County (where ""Ant-Man"" was shot last year) and the redevelopment of a Midtown facility for a new film and television master's degree program at the Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD). It also fails to account for how many of the 43 productions in Georgia today, including a popular ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" sequel, would have selected the state without its growing ability to handle production. ""The good news, really, is the tax credits are spurring an indigenous film industry taking shape in Georgia,"" Seaman said. ""It‚Äôs incredibly complicated and you would have to look at all of the details on a project-by-project basis to seriously know what‚Äôs going on."" ""The irony is, without that study, you are clearly overstating the short-term impacts but we appear to be understating the longer-term impacts. We wouldn‚Äôt know without more careful study."" Our ruling The booming film industry in Georgia generated $6 billion in economic impact in the state in the most recent fiscal year, according to the state department of economic development. The calculation is based on formula the state has used for at least 30 years, multiplied against direct spending. There is no dispute that direct spending on productions has mushroomed, but the state can‚Äôt explain why it uses a multiplier that is almost double the standard economic model for that calculation. The state‚Äôs formula likely also fails to capture long-term spending and investment that have taken hold in Georgia. There is accuracy in the claim, especially in the carefully tracked direct spending from film and TV production in the state. But it leaves out important information that could better prove, or disprove, the statement.

John Kasich: 'I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole ‚Ä¶ to a $2 billion surplus'
","During the Republican presidential debate on his home turf of Cleveland, Ohio Gov. John Kasich touted his economic record in the state. Repeating a claim he has often made -- including on his campaign website -- Kasich said, ""I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole ‚Ä¶ to a $2 billion surplus."" We decided to take a closer look. An $8 billion hole? There‚Äôs an argument for $8 billion, but there‚Äôs also an argument for something closer to $6 billion, according to a deep dive by the Cleveland Plain Dealer in 2011. The $8 billion figure is rounded up from a $7.7 billion gap between spending and expected revenues. It was an initial estimate from January 2011, based on the assumption made several months earlier that there would be no new revenue growth. However, revenues did grow as the economy rebounded that year, reducing the gap to between $5.9 billion to $6.1 billion -- a calculation that Kasich‚Äôs budget director, Tim Keen, agreed with ""conceptually"" in a 2011 interview with the newspaper, though he took issue with some of the methodological details. Whatever the number, Kasich avoided a potential misstep when he spoke of this in the debate as a ""hole"" rather than a deficit, since Ohio, like most states, cannot run an actual budget deficit. The $8 billion gap is more accurately described as a projected shortfall rather than a deficit. A $2 billion surplus? This figure is clearer. The state‚Äôs Office of Budget and Management reported in July 2015 that the state‚Äôs ""rainy day fund"" had a little more than $2 billion in it, up from effectively zero when Kasich took office in 2011. Does Kasich deserve credit? It‚Äôs not unreasonable to give Kasich some credit for the state‚Äôs improving economic fortunes -- he is a governor, after all, and he forged the state‚Äôs fiscal policy in concert with the Legislature. But it‚Äôs important to remember that he took office at the very beginning of the national economic recovery, and as the national economy has improved, so has Ohio‚Äôs. When Kasich was inaugurated in January 2011, the unemployment rate in Ohio was 9.2 percent -- exactly the same as the national rate. Today, the national unemployment rate is 5.3 percent and the rate in Ohio is 5.2 percent. So Kasich‚Äôs timing has been fortunate. Our ruling Kasich said, ""I took the state of Ohio from an $8 billion hole ‚Ä¶ to a $2 billion surplus."" It‚Äôs possible to argue over whether the initial amount should be $6 billion rather than $8 billion. But Kasich didn‚Äôt pull that figure out of thin air, and it certainly was high by historical standards. He also used the term ""hole,"" which is more appropriate than ""deficit"" would have been. Meanwhile, the $2 billion figure seems solid. Still, it‚Äôs worth noting that Kasich spoke a little grandly when he said that ""I"" did it, since the state‚Äôs fiscal improvement got a big assist from the national economic recovery. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/07/john-kasich/kasich-i-took-state-ohio-8-billion-hole-2-billion-/

Rubio: America is 'most generous' country when it comes to legal immigration
","When U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida addressed the topic of immigration during the first Republican debate, he portrayed our country as the leading repository of legal immigrants. ""This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration,"" Rubio said Aug. 6. ""There are a million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States and people feel like we are being taken advantage of."" Rubio went on to talk about people who call his office in frustration as they wait years to come to the United States legally. Statements about illegal immigration by Rubio, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and businessman Donald Trump were hot topics during the debate. Here, we will fact-check whether Rubio got his figure right, and we will explain what he means about the United States being the ""most generous in the world when it comes to immigration."" Legal immigration Rubio‚Äôs stance on how to change immigration laws has been a hot topic since 2013 since Rubio and seven other senators crafted bipartisan legislation that passed the Senate. The bill included a pathway to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants, though one with significant hurdles. But the House wasn‚Äôt interested in that approach, and after that died, Rubio said he still favored changing immigration law through piecemeal bills. In May, Rubio said at the National Review Forum that ""We have a legal immigration system in America that accepts 1 million people a year, legally. No other country in the world even comes close to that."" As we explained in our earlier fact-check, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security keeps track of the number of new legal permanent residents a year, and in 2013 it was just shy of 1 million at 990,553. Of the 2013 number, about 46 percent were new arrivals, and about 54 percent were people already in the United States whose status was upgraded to ""permanent."" As for how the United States stacks up against other countries in terms of legal immigration, we turned to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. Formed in 1961, the OECD collects data on a wide range of topics, including immigration. We looked at the data in two ways for 2013: First, the sheer number of legal immigrants and secondly, the number of new immigrants as a percentage of the population. OECD standardizes the data from various countries to make them comparable with those in the United States. That process aims to count only permanent residents and exclude other categories such as seasonal workers or students. When we fact-checked Rubio‚Äôs claim in May, the OECD was in the process of standardizing the data for 2013, but expected the United States to be in the top spot for the sheer number of immigrants with nearly 1 million immigrants. Provisional figures by OECD showed that Germany had 466,000 while the United Kingdom had 291,000. In per capita rates,the United States placed 19th out of 24 countries. That means that the United States received fewer immigrants per capita in 2012-13 compared with several European countries, New Zealand, Australia and Canada. Our ruling Rubio said, ""This is the most generous country in the world when it comes to immigration. There are million people a year who legally immigrate to the United States."" Rubio got his number correct: Nearly 1 million legal immigrants came to the United States in 2013, according to data from the federal government. In terms of sheer numbers, that puts the United States ahead of other countries, but not in terms of a percentage of the population.

Donald Trump: 'The Mexican government ... they send the bad ones over'
","In the first Republican primary debate of the 2016 presidential race, billionaire developer Donald Trump -- the leader in recent polls -- made a splash. Early in the debate, Fox News‚Äô Chris Wallace, one of the moderators, pressed Trump on some of his past statements about undocumented immigration -- the signature issue of Trump‚Äôs campaign. Wallace asked Trump, ""What evidence do you have, specific evidence, that the Mexican government is sending criminals across the border?"" Trump cited conversations with ""border patrol people"" who told him that it was true: ""Our leaders are stupid, our politicians are stupid, and the Mexican government is much smarter, much sharper, much more cunning, and they send the bad ones over because they don't want to pay for them, they don't want to take care of them. Why should they, when the stupid leaders of the United States will do it for them?And that‚Äôs what‚Äôs happening, whether you like it or not."" We checked a previous comment by Trump on this topic. In a July 8 interview with NBC, Trump told interviewer Katy Tur, ""The Mexican government forces many bad people into our country because they're smart. They're smarter than our leaders, and their negotiators are far better than what we have, to a degree that you wouldn‚Äôt believe. They're forcing people into our country. ‚Ä¶ And they are drug dealers and they are criminals of all kinds. We are taking Mexico‚Äôs problems."" Is the Mexican government sending people across the border, rather than individuals making decisions on their own to leave in search of seek employment or to join family members in the United States? When we talked to a range of immigration experts, we found wide agreement that that there is no evidence to support Trump‚Äôs claim. For evidence, we started with the Mexican Migration Project, a bi-national research effort founded in 1982 to study Mexican migration to the United States. Anthropologists, sociologists and other experts with the project gather data, including field interviews with migrants, that illuminate migration patterns. The co-director of the project is Douglas Massey, a professor of sociology and public policy at Princeton University. Based on more than three decades of field research, Massey found Trump‚Äôs assertion to be flat wrong. He pointed to findings from a paper he published in 2014 in the journal International Migration Review. In the paper, he and his co-authors concluded that undocumented migration from Mexico ""was driven largely by U.S. labor demand and by the existence of well-developed migrant networks that provided migrants with access to U.S. labor markets despite a rising enforcement effort. The taking of additional trips is likewise tied to U.S. labor demand and access to migrant networks, as well as the number of U.S. trips a migrant has accumulated over his or her career."" What about Mexican government efforts to push migrants into the United States? Nonexistent, Massey told PolitiFact. ""Mexico has never had a policy of pushing migrants toward the United States, much less ‚Äòforcing many bad people into our country,‚Äô "" Massey said. ""Mexican migration is tied to social and economic circumstances on both sides of the border."" Other experts sided with Massey. ""Immigrants come to work or to join family,"" said Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the Pew Research Center‚Äôs Hispanic Trends Project. ""And no, the Mexican government doesn‚Äôt force anyone to leave."" ""No, the Mexican government doesn't force anyone to move here illegally, though it certainly doesn't object,"" added Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors low levels of immigration. Tom Smith, a demographer at the University of Chicago, drew a contrast with one historical example in which a government did take a role in pushing certain people to emigrate to the United States -- the Mariel boatlift from Cuba in 1980. ""While most immigrants were simply part of the general Cuban population of people wanting to emigrate, it appears that the Cuban government did intentionally send a disproportionate number of those they deemed to be undesirables, including prisoners and other institutionalized groups,"" Smith said. But there is no such evidence that the same thing has happened in Mexico, he added. About the closest support for Trump‚Äôs claim that we could find is the argument that the Mexican government‚Äôs failure to provide strong economic growth and restrain drug violence has been a factor in convincing people to leave the country and come to the United States. Still, it‚Äôs not accurate to equate the Mexican government‚Äôs inability to accomplish these goals and the idea that the government is pushing people out. It‚Äôs also worth noting that migration from Mexico to the United States has been declining in recent years. This is due to demographic factors more than anything else, Massey said. Trump ""does not seem to have gotten the memo, but undocumented migration stopped in 2008 and has been zero or negative since -- not because the economic fundamentals have changed, but because the fertility rate dropped from 6.7 births per woman in 1970 to 2.2 births today, bringing about an aging of the population,"" Massey said. ""People initiate migration between the ages of 18 and 30, and if they don't migrate then, they are unlikely ever to migrate."" In other words, Massey said, the number of people in the age category most conducive to immigration is dropping, so immigration is dropping as well. Our ruling Trump said, ""The Mexican government ... they send the bad ones over."" Setting aside the question of whether Mexicans who have come to the United States are ""bad"" or not, we found no evidence of any Mexican policy that pushes people out of Mexico and into the United States. As has been the case for decades, a combination of economic and family factors accounts for most of the migration from Mexico to the United States.

Rachel Maddow says Fox 'changed' poll eligibility criteria on day it announced top 10 for GOP debate
","There‚Äôs no love lost between MSNBC‚Äôs Rachel Maddow and Fox News. The liberal show host frequently chastises the conservative Fox News, and the network‚Äôs process of picking the top 10 candidates for the first Republican presidential debate gave Maddow another opportunity. Maddow aimed her barb at the explanation Fox News gave for deciding who would be the last candidate to make the cut-off. Fox News gave Ohio Gov. John Kasich the coveted 10th slot at the expense of former Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Maddow accused Fox News of unilaterally sounding the death knell for the lesser-ranked candidates seven months before the first Iowa voter would show up at the nation‚Äôs first caucus. ""If a candidate can't even make it to the debate stage, why would rational donors and volunteers continue giving money and time to what is apparently a lost cause,"" Maddow said on her Aug. 4, 2015, show. A bit later, Maddow said, ""Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate."" In particular, Maddow chastised Fox for not using an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that was the fifth-most recent poll on record. Fox News skipped that poll and used a slightly older poll from Quinnipiac. Maddow said this shift cost Rick Perry a shot at the nomination. ""He didn't lose it, it was stolen from him,"" ¬†she said. ""Not because of the vagaries of some poll but because of some cable news executives moving things around to effectively stack things against him."" Maddow compared what Fox News had said before and what it said after it made its picks. In this fact-check, we focus just on the question of whether Fox changed the rules of the game for the polls it would use. Fox News became more nuanced with the polls In May, when Fox News first announced the debates, it laid down several selection criteria for the candidates. Among them was this: ""Must place in the top 10 of an average of the five most recent national polls, as recognized by FOX News leading up to August 4th at 5 PM/ET. Such polling must be conducted by major, nationally recognized organizations that use standard methodological techniques."" Fox News directed us to a Bloomberg article that added just one detail from Michael Clemente, executive vice president of news for Fox. Clemente said online and partisan polls were unacceptable. But on Aug. 4, when Fox News unveiled who would make it to the main stage (a forum for the runners-up takes place earlier at 5 p.m.), it gave a far more detailed explanation of its selection rules than what it laid out in May: ‚Ä¢ ""They are the five most recent national polls from non-partisan, nationally-recognized organizations using standard methodological techniques. Recency was determined by actual interview dates (not release date)."" ¬† ‚Ä¢ ""They used live interviewers, random digit-dial sampling techniques and included both landlines and cellphones. (No online or automated (IVR) polls were used.)"" ‚Ä¢ ""Their GOP primary vote question mirrored the ballot by reading all candidate names in random order and without honorifics."" ‚Ä¢ ""Results among registered voters were used rather than national adult results when available. Furthermore, only results among either 1) self-identified Republican primary voters or 2) Republican and Republican-leaning voters were used."" ‚Ä¢ ""The rank order was determined by a simple arithmetic average of publicly available results. Averages were rounded to the nearest tenth of a percentage point."" ‚Ä¢ ""Each poll has a different margin of error, and averaging requires a distinct test of statistical significance. Given the over 2,400 interviews contained within the five polls, from a purely statistical perspective it is at least 90% likely that the tenth place Kasich is ahead the eleventh place Perry."" ‚Ä¢ ""We did not include the highly-respected NBC/WSJ poll, which is the fifth most recent poll, only because it did not meet our criterion that the poll read the names of each Republican candidate in the vote question. We would note, however, even though their ballot question included Perry but did not name Kasich, the unaided ""Kasich"" response tied the aided ""Perry"" response. In short, their results are consistent with the results of the other polls in our review, and consistent with the resulting placement in the Fox News debate."" In May, Fox News took 45 words to describe how it would use polls to pick the candidates. In August, it used more than 260. Without a doubt, Fox moved from a broad to a detailed approach. We turned to political scientists to help us assess whether that shift is the same as Maddow‚Äôs claim that ""Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria."" A change of uncertain significance The bottom line from the analysts we reached is that the original poll criteria were destined to be insufficient to meet the goal of giving Fox News a clear ranking of the top 10. During her show, Maddow interviewed Larry Sabato from the University of Virginia Center for Politics. We asked Sabato to assess her statement. ""We were never sure which polls could be included and which could not, beyond the requirements about live calls/interviewers and the like,"" Sabato told PunditFact. ""You can call it ‚Äòchanging the rules‚Äô if you want, but you could also say they reserved to themselves some flexibility, not knowing precisely what the polling community would serve up."" David P. Redlawsk, a political scientist at Rutgers University, said Fox could have done more to avoid this situation. ""They added criteria after they saw what the polls were,"" Redlawsk said. ""To me this is different. Fox should have been more specific from the beginning."" By comparison, in May, CNN named the polls it would use for the debates it plans for September and provided a much more detailed description of how it would use those polling results. That said, Fox News‚Äô decision to use polls based on when they called voters and how they posed their questions passed muster with Robert Erikson at Columbia University. ""If Kasich was not on the NBC/WSJ ballot, the Fox decision makes sense,"" Erikson said. ""Release data is less important than date in the field. It was my impression that even with NBC/WSJ included, Perry would lose out, only by an even more trivial amount."" Michael Traugott, a professor of political science at the University of Michigan, has taken a careful look at how news organizations use polls.¬†He wrote a critique of CNN‚Äôs ""poll of polls"" after the 2008 election. ""The most important point is that the system is arbitrary, used to satisfy production values for television rather than being based on any substantive or political consideration,"" he told us. ""The network is trying to use a statistical justification to cover a news judgment decision."" Traugott said that taking the average of candidate standing in polls is a bad idea on a number of grounds. Mainly, differences in how polling organizations chose their respondents and phrase their questions have a much greater impact than the statistical margin of error. Traugott said that in large measure, Fox set itself up for this problem. ""If you are vague initially, when the time comes, you have to specify the details by which you acted,"" he said. We contacted both MSNBC and Fox News. MSNBC said Maddow‚Äôs statement was correct based on Fox News adding the criteria that the GOP primary vote question mirror ""the ballot by reading all candidate names in random order and without honorifics."" Fox News declared that this made no difference. Our ruling Maddow said that ""Fox changed around their poll eligibility criteria on the day they announced who is in and out of their debate."" We found that the poll criteria were much more detailed in August (over 260 words long) than they were in May (about 45 words long). The network could have been more precise early on, but Fox did leave¬†some room for itself when it qualified the¬†polls it planned to use for the debate back in May with¬†""as recognized by Fox News."" Also, some experts said, Maddow exaggerated the impact of the approach Fox News ultimately used, and she implied that statistical certainty was achievable under any circumstances.¬† Fox News moved from a broad approach to a more detailed one, and experts aren't convinced that it slighted Perry. With those missing caveats,¬†we¬†rate Maddow's¬†claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/06/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-fox-changed-poll-eligibility-cr/

Arthenia Joyner says Jeb Bush cut state's early voting hours
","The Florida Legislature‚Äôs Democratic minority leader challenged former Gov. Jeb Bush‚Äôs commitment to voting outreach, accusing him of limiting access to polling places for black voters. Sen. Arthenia Joyner of Tampa sent out a letter addressed to Bush, who is running for the GOP presidential nomination, ahead of his speech to the National Urban League in Fort Lauderdale on July 31, 2015, excoriating him for shortening early voting hours as governor. She also said he purged voter rolls and refused to restore voting rights to convicted felons. ""Also troubling was your decision to significantly cut early voting prior to the 2008 presidential election,"" Joyner wrote on July 30. She said legislation he signed was designed ""to diminish turnout in minority communities that were increasingly relying on early voting."" PolitiFact Florida has addressed the Bush-era voting purges in 2000 and 2004 before, as well as the recent history of restoring felon voting rights. But did Bush cut early voting hours? It turns out that while he signed a 2004 bill that allowed early voting, he also signed a bill the following year that set new limits on the practice. Voting changes After the 2000 presidential election‚Äôs numerous problems, Florida overhauled its system and began allowing early voting for the first time with a law Bush signed in 2004. That law provided for a¬†statewide maximum of 14 early voting days and¬†at least eight hours of voting per day. Early voting days could be any length counties chose; Pinellas allowed 10 hours per day in 2004, while Miami-Dade kept early voting polling places open for 12 hours per day. Many Floridians welcomed the changes, with some counties reporting more than 50 percent of voters cast ballots before Election Day. But there also were some reports of harassment at poorly monitored early voting sites, issues with poorly tested voting methods and a general lack of oversight for some locations, according to a 2005 Early Voting Information Center study. Still, some election supervisors asked lawmakers to expand early voting hours and add more locations. Bush and the GOP-led Legislature decided to do the opposite the following year. Joyner did not return our email or phone calls, but the 2005 law she mentioned, HB 1567, cut voting hours to a maximum of eight hours per day and limited polling places to election offices, city halls and libraries. Polling places could only be open between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m. Early voting also couldn‚Äôt be held more than eight hours total on any weekend, and it had to end the Sunday before the election. It did not change the 14-day maximum, but it did cut hours for counties that kept polls open longer than eight hours. In Miami-Dade, for example, early voting hours were cut by a third from prior 12-hour days, speaking to Joyner‚Äôs characterization that Bush ""significantly cut"" early voting. The changes took effect for the 2006 election cycle, the last before Bush left office in January 2007. Democrats accused Republicans of trying to limit access for minorities and workers who couldn‚Äôt leave their jobs to vote. GOP legislators said the changes were to bring some uniformity to polling options. Two years later, Illinois Sen. Barack Obama won Florida en route to a victory in the 2008 presidential election. There were reports of very long lines and finicky voting machines that year, but there also was an increase in registered voters. Between December 2007 and October 2008, more than 233,000 black Floridians registered to vote. About 54 percent of black voters cast early ballots in the 2008 election. Early voting continues to be popular statewide, especially with Democratic voters. About 53 percent of the 6 million people who participated in the 2014 election voted early in person or by absentee ballot. But debate over early voting remained after Bush left office.¬†Gov. Rick Scott and the Legislature in 2011 further reduced the maximum early voting days to eight days. Long lines subsequently plagued the 2012 presidential election. An Ohio State study estimated 201,000 Floridians didn‚Äôt vote because of the wait on Election Day. In 2013, Scott signed a bill restoring early voting to up to 12 hours a day for 14 days. Our ruling Joyner said Bush ""significantly cut early voting prior to the 2008 presidential election."" Bush signed a 2005 bill limiting early voting to a maximum of eight hours per day, specifying the changes would take effect in 2006. That did scale back early voting hours in some counties quite a bit. But there‚Äôs no mention that Bush also signed the 2004 bill that established early voting in Florida in the first place, part of a post-2000 election overhaul. We also have to add that the GOP-led Legislature drafted both bills. Joyner‚Äôs statement is accurate but could use additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/05/arthenia-joyner/arthenia-joyner-says-jeb-bush-cut-states-early-vot/

Hillary Clinton says the stock market has done better under Democratic presidents
","Does the stock market boom under Democratic presidents? Hillary Clinton said so during a town hall in Nashua, N.H., on July 28, 2015. ""You know the evidence is pretty clear that under Democratic presidents, going a ways back, people do better,"" Clinton said, at around 5:30 in this video. ""And not only working people, middle class people. Even the stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House."" We wondered: Is it true that ""the stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House""? We took a closer look. Scrutinizing the stock ticker There have been a couple studies addressing this question, and they all agree: For whatever reason, going back more than a century, the stock market has done better under Democratic presidents than Republican presidents. A 2012 report by CMC Markets, an international financial firm, found that since 1900, the United States‚Äô stock markets have posted an average annual return of 15.31 percent under Democratic presidents, compared to just 5.43 percent under Republicans. Another study from 2012 by Adviser Perspectives newsletter, using somewhat different methodology, found that since 1900, the Dow Jones Industrial Average has gained 8.7 percent annually under a Democratic president, compared to 5.7 percent under Republicans. And calculations by The Economist found that the Barclays U.S. equity index gained a cumulative 300 percent under Democratic presidents between 1929 and 2011, compared to about zero under Republican presidents. To bring the data up to date, we checked in with Sam Stovall, the chief investment strategist at S&P Equity Research in New York. He had previously found a big Democratic advantage in stock market gains through 2012. From 1901 through July 31, 2015, Stovall found, the stock market gained 8.7 percent under Democratic presidents, compared to 5.3 percent under Republican presidents. The same pattern held in Stovall‚Äôs data since the end of World War II ‚Äî in fact, it was even more pronounced. Since 1945, the markets gained 11.2 percent under Democratic presidents and 6.3 percent under Republican presidents. And it wasn‚Äôt just the stock market that chalked up better performance under Democratic presidents, according to a July 2014 paper by Princeton University economists Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. They found a performance gap between the parties that was ""startlingly large"" over a wide variety of economic metrics. ""The U.S. economy not only grows faster, according to real GDP and other measures, during Democratic versus Republican presidencies, it also produces more jobs, lowers the unemployment rate, generates higher corporate profits and investment, and turns in higher stock market returns,"" Blinder and Watson wrote. ""Indeed, it outperforms under almost all standard macroeconomic metrics."" What does this mean? So, multiple studies show that Clinton‚Äôs claim is numerically correct. But what, if anything, can we conclude from it? Experts said it‚Äôs best not to go overboard in drawing conclusions about White House control and stock market performance. Here are some of the reasons why. ‚Ä¢ A lot of this stems from luck and timing. Republicans are cursed by having Herbert Hoover on their presidential roster. The stock-market decline was so quick and deep under Hoover that it continues to hobble the party‚Äôs stock-market performance all these decades later. Meanwhile, starting at such a low point was a huge help to his Democratic successor, Franklin D. Roosevelt. In fact, if you remove Hoover from the GOP column, the average monthly return for Republicans improves significantly, from a 0.38 percent average monthly return to a 0.61 percent monthly return. The Hoover-free GOP number is within striking distance of the Democratic mark of 0.73 percent, said Lawrence J. White, a professor at New York University‚Äôs Stern School of Business. White doesn‚Äôt argue that it‚Äôs fairest to remove Hoover from the GOP‚Äôs calculation. Rather, he said, it‚Äôs a reminder that relatively small changes due at least in part to unlucky timing can have big effects on the end result. ‚Ä¢ Partisan labels are only somewhat helpful. ""What matters is the relationship of policy to the stock market, not partisan labels,"" said Dan Mitchell, an economist with the libertarian Cato Institute. ""Economic policy under Bill Clinton was far more market-oriented than it was under either Bush or Nixon."" ‚Ä¢ A ""good"" stock market is harder to define than one might think. For instance, a healthy year-over-year increase in the stock market may sound good, but if it comes with high volatility throughout the year, that can be a lot less pleasant for investors, said Tom Arnold, a professor of finance at the University of Richmond Robins School of Business. Meanwhile, ""down markets are buying opportunities and up markets are selling opportunities for the purpose of cashing in on profits, possibly from securities purchased in a down market,"" Arnold said. "" ‚ÄòBetter‚Äô in one market is usually at the cost of another market."" ‚Ä¢ Market results don‚Äôt align neatly with presidential terms. ""The stock market makes an anticipatory assessment of a president and his policies shortly after his election ‚Äî or even before the election,"" White said. ""So the market's anticipation of what an incoming president will do occurs during the last few months of the incumbent‚Äôs presidency."" He noted that this factor was even stronger prior to 1936, when the new president was inaugurated on March 4, leaving four months of stock market anticipation in the previous president‚Äôs column. ‚Ä¢ A president is only one factor in determining stock market performance. Perhaps most important, experts urge caution in ascribing too much credit to a president for how the stock market performs on his watch. Often ‚Äî including now, during a period of strong stock-market gains ‚Äî Congress is held by the opposing party. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve, which plays a crucial role in the economy by directing the nation‚Äôs monetary policy, operates independently once appointments are made by the president and confirmed by Congress. And a host of other factors that a president can‚Äôt control, including technological advances and international economic trends, play a role as well. In their paper, Blinder and Watson focus on two factors as most important in determining economic performance. One is the presence or absence of an energy price shock -- something that, unfortunately for the GOP, hit during the presidencies of Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford and George W. Bush, compared to just once under a Democrat, Jimmy Carter. The other factor they pointed to is what economists call ""total factor productivity,"" defined as the portion of economic output not explained by the amount of inputs used in production. Think of it as the economy‚Äôs special sauce, or its extra bang for the buck. Although it‚Äôs unclear why, Democratic presidents have benefited from higher total factor productivity, most clearly during the technology boom under Bill Clinton, which produced significant productivity gains. Hillary Clinton‚Äôs campaign emphasized to PolitiFact that she didn‚Äôt say that the president is the only factor that went into stock market results. Still, our experts agreed that while the numbers to back up her claim are clear, the meaning and significance of those numbers should be taken with a grain of salt. ""I wouldn't place much weight on it, one way or the other,"" White said. Our ruling Clinton said that ""the stock market does better when you have a Democratic president in the White House."" The numbers back her up, but it‚Äôs worth noting that luck, timing and several other factors in the broader economy also play a role in determining stock market performance. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/aug/04/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-says-stock-market-has-done-better-/

Is a Navy officer who shot at the Chattanooga shooter facing charges?
","The story about what‚Äôs happening to a Navy officer ""will make your blood boil,"" professes a Aug. 1 headline on the blog of former Rep. Allen West, R-Fla., a retired Army lieutenant colonel It stems from the July 16, 2015, shooting in Chattanooga, in which a gunman, Muhammad Abdulazeez, began firing at two military facilities, killing four Marines and a Navy sailor. During the onslaught, the commanding officer at the Navy Operational Support Center in Chattanooga used his personal firearm to fire back at Abdulazeez, according to Navy leaders and the officer himself. While some supporters are circulating a petition to honor the actions of the officer, Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White, West said that the Navy is prosecuting him for using his gun. ""Ladies and gents, resulting from the text message I received yesterday, I can confirm that the United States Navy is bringing charges against Lt. Cmdr. Timothy White for illegally discharging a firearm on federal property,"" West wrote. And West wasn‚Äôt the only political figure raising the alarm. Democratic presidential candidate Jim Webb, former secretary of the Navy, also tweeted that he had heard the same thing. ""Navy charging LCDR Tim White w/ a crime for trying to defend our sailors & Marines in #Chattanooga? He deserves a medal, not an indictment,"" Webb tweeted. He later added, ""The charge being considered is illegally discharging a firearm on federal property."" Many readers asked us to look into the claims in West‚Äôs blog, which was the source for other posts that proliferated on the Internet. So we took a closer look. Unsubstantiated rumors For the record, the Navy has issued a full denial that they have charged or are planning to charge White with any crime related to the Chattanooga shooting incident, both in posts on Facebook and an interview with PolitiFact. ""I can tell you definitively it‚Äôs not true,"" Navy spokesman Lieutenant Junior Grade Johnny Michael told PolitiFact. Michael said an investigation into all aspects of the shooting is under way and is far from finished, so no charges are pending or even being seriously considered at this point. ""(Prosecution) is not in the works. We have no plans to press charges,"" Michael said, declining to speculate further about the course of the investigation. We reached out to White to ask him ourselves, but we didn‚Äôt hear back. There are only a handful of media reports on this question, and most of those include a statement from the Navy saying the rumor is false. So how did these rumors start? Webb said on Twitter that he ""confirmed with a defense official."" West‚Äôs blog said he considered the charges confirmed when he received a text message from an unidentified person asking if West could meet with White. We reached out to West for clarification. Through a spokesperson at the National Center for Policy Analysis -- a conservative think tank where he is the CEO -- West deferred comment to Navy officials and White‚Äôs attorney, though he did not name the attorney. The blog also linked to an article from a conservative website, Western Journalism, that said White could in theory be punished for violating a policy (not a law) that says only certain employees can carry firearms at military sites. The Western Journalism article does not say that White is facing any criminal charges or other punishment. It‚Äôs also worth noting a difference between this policy about carrying firearms at a military site and the potential charges that West and Webb said White would face:¬†illegally discharging a weapon on federal property. There is a federal law that says people are not allowed to use or¬†carry weapons on federal facilities.¬†There¬†is an exemption¬†for some members of the military regarding their ability to carry weapons on federal property, though we don‚Äôt know if White fell under this exemption. Our ruling West wrote that the Navy ""is bringing charges against"" a Navy officer who shot at the Chattanooga shooter ""for illegally discharging a firearm on federal property."" Certainly no charges were filed at the time West wrote his blog post, and none have been filed to date. To the contrary, the Navy has said that it has ""no plans to press charges,"" and we have found no credible reporting to call the Navy‚Äôs official statement into question.

Fox Business reporter: 95% of Planned Parenthood's 'pregnancy services' were abortions
","Republican presidential candidate Mike Huckabee supports the federal government cutting off more than $500 million to Planned Parenthood, calling the organization¬†""an industry of abortion"" in a recent Fox Business Channel interview. His interviewer, Fox Business reporter Sandra Smith, did not disagree ‚Äî and she offered numbers to back up her point. ""Almost 95 percent of all their pregnancy services were abortions,"" Smith said as she guest-hosted Mornings with Maria on July 28, 2015. We wanted to know if the percentage of abortions was really that high. We reached out to Smith for comment but did not hear back. 'Pregnancy services' Viewers may miss that Smith‚Äôs statement refers only to ""pregnancy services.""¬†By choosing those¬†words,¬†she¬†is likely referencing a fact sheet by the Susan B. Anthony List, a political action committee that opposes abortion and supports anti-abortion candidates. The Susan B. Anthony List‚Äôs numbers derive from Planned Parenthood‚Äôs 2013-14 annual report. The first caveat to know¬†is that Planned Parenthood does not have a category for ""pregnancy services.""¬†That‚Äôs a category the Susan B. Anthony List created, and the background reasoning has been the same as similarly misleading¬†claims over the years. On the fact sheet, ""pregnancy services"" are broken down into three categories: abortions, prenatal care and adoption referrals. Susan B. Anthony List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley said these are the three ways a woman can respond to a pregnancy. With that in mind, here‚Äôs the section from Planned Parenthood‚Äôs annual report that contains those categories.¬†  To arrive at the Susan B. Anthony List figure, you have to tease out specific elements¬†from the chart:¬†prenatal services (18,684), adoption referrals (1,880) and abortions (327,653).¬†Abortions account for 94 percent of the sum of these subcategories.¬† For several¬†reasons, that‚Äôs a misleading way to analyze the data. Referrals for prenatal care not in equation Not all of Planned Parenthood approximately 700¬†clinics offer prenatal services because prenatal care is not Planned Parenthood's focus.¬†As a result,¬†many pregnant women are referred to outside obstetricians or other health providers for prenatal care.¬† How many? It's impossible to know. Planned Parenthood does not record how many¬†pregnant patients are referred to outside health care providers,¬†said Elizabeth Clark, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman.¬† If referrals were included, the 95 percent figure would likely change, though we can't say by¬†how much ‚Äî and neither can Smith nor the Susan B. Anthony List. The rest of the story Planned Parenthood¬†does not specifically¬†track of the number of pregnant women who come into clinics for¬†other reasons. And many of Planned Parenthood's services are not related to prenatal care, abortion or adoption.¬† Testing and treatment for sexually transmitted disease and¬†infection, both for men and women, accounts for the largest share of services provided by Planned Parenthood at¬†more than 4.47 million. Contraception, which includes birth control, emergency contraception¬†kits, and¬†sterilization and vasectomy procedures, accounts for more than 3.58 million¬†services.¬†Different types of cancer screening and prevention, including breast exams,¬†account for 935,573 services.¬† As show on the chart above, there were also¬†more than 1.1 million pregnancy tests, 47,2000 urinary tract infection treatments,¬†or 65,500 ""family practice services."" Over the course of 2013-14, Planned Parenthood performed more than 10.5 million services. Sometimes patients are double-counted because they receive multiple services. Put another way. Planned Parenthood clinics saw 2.7 million individual patients that year. Of all services, abortions¬†account for 3 percent of services performed, said Erica Sackin, a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman, pointing to page 18 of the report.¬† But looking at the share of abortions per patient (and¬†assuming one procedure per patient), the figure rises to¬†12 percent. Some critics have taken issue with Planned Parenthood‚Äôs measurement of ""services."" Performing an abortion is more involved than administering pregnancy tests or giving someone a contraception kit, for example. The share of abortions might be different if cost or hours of services were used. (However, that information is not in the 2013-14 annual report.) Our ruling Smith said, ""Almost 95 percent of all (Planned Parenthood's) pregnancy services were abortions."" An anti-abortion group puts¬†the figure at 94 percent using a cherry-picked method that ignores the majority of Planned Parenthood's services, which aim to prevent pregnancies. The group describes¬†""pregnancy services"" as counting what Planned Parenthood does for women once they are already pregnant. But Planned Parenthood does not fully track this number, making the claim a leap of logic based on insufficient information.¬†What's most noticeably missing among the number of Planned Parenthood¬†services used by pregnant women are the number of pregnancy referrals. Planned Parenthood says it doesn't keep records of how many pregnant women are referred to outside healthcare providers.¬†Without that information, we don't know an accurate¬†percentage of ""pregnancy services"" that were abortions.¬†Neither, however, does Smith. We rate the claim False. UPDATE:¬†After this fact-check published, an official with Planned Parenthood contacted us and said that she was not authorized to speak on¬†the¬†record. A spokeswoman who is authorized to speak on¬†the¬†record, Elizabeth Clark, then provided us the same information.

Rush Limbaugh says Austin effectively banning barbecue restaurants
","Conservative Rush Limbaugh told listeners that liberal Austin has moved toward wiping out local barbecue joints. On his July 28, 2015, program, the commentator read from a web post stating the Austin City Council in April 2015 ""passed a preliminary plan"" restricting smoke from barbecue restaurants. Limbaugh said the web post went on to say the contemplated requirement that restaurants install costly devices to diffuse smoke led a business expert to tell council members ""these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin."" ""It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue,"" Limbaugh echoed. What ""kind of an absurd requirement is this anyway?"" he added. Smoke pouring from commercial barbecue smokers has been a hot Austin topic, in particular pitting a new South Austin restaurant against nearby homeowners who say its smoke wafting their way has reduced the value of their homesteads. And did the council adopt a plan amounting to a ban on ‚Äòcue restaurants? Citing a website Limbaugh, according to a transcript of his program, recited as fact a July 25, 2015, web post on IAmATexan.com, headlined ""Austin City Council Votes to Ban BBQ Restaurants."" That post said the council had passed a preliminary plan to restrict smoke from barbecue restaurants, continuing: ""The city council‚Äôs current proposal will require smoke diffusers and will also limit the amount of time that restaurants can smoke. These restrictions will require at least $100,000 in extra investments for most barbecue restaurants as they will be forced to buy extra smokers along with severely expensive diffusers, and in some cases will have to lease or purchase more property. ""One business expert told council members that these restrictions will certainly kill all but the largest barbecue restaurants in Austin. ""It is effectively a ban on barbecue restaurants in a town known for its barbecue."" We didn‚Äôt connect with the unnamed authors of that post. Nor did our query to Limbaugh draw a reply. But Austin American-Statesman news stories, City of Austin documents and responses by a city spokeswoman indicate that after the council talked about imposing controls to reduce unwanted smoke from restaurant smokers, members directed the city manager, Marc Ott, to gather public input and make recommendations. As of late July 2015, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean said, one City Council committee had recommended no citywide restrictions while another council panel, slated to reconvene Aug. 3, 2015, had not made a recommendation. Limbaugh‚Äôs claim, Dean said, is not true. Blowing smoke in Austin Let‚Äôs scrape up the details--which extend to the city pulling together this 2015 document delivering a breakdown of Austin barbecue trailers and restaurants and the hours each one operates a smoker (around the clock to three times daily ""for flavor"" to not at all). After Terry Black‚Äôs Barbecue opened, on Barton Springs Road just south of Lady Bird Lake, nearby neighbors objected to smoke from its pit blowing into their yards and homes--not every day, residents initially said, but often enough depending on prevailing winds. Mike Black said in a January 2015 statement to the American-Statesman that he intended to work with residents to address concerns. In July 2015, residents filed a lawsuit against the restaurant. Credit for publicly suggesting the city regulate smoke from restaurants belongs to Austin City Council Member Sabino ""Pio"" Renteria, whose idea to require smoke mitigation wasn‚Äôt embraced by pitmasters who said purchasing expensive ""smoke scrubbers"" could kill barbecue stands inside the city limits. ""It will force 99 percent of Austin BBQ places to either close or move out of town,"" John Mueller of John Mueller Meat Co. said in a statement. In March 2015, Renteria said he was revising his original proposal to have it apply only to restaurants and mobile food vendors within 100 feet of residential property‚Äîdown from 150 feet. He also said he wanted to look at other smoke-mitigating options besides scrubbers. At a March 31, 2015, work session, council members questioned how regulating smoke emissions would affect small businesses and longtime businesses, and whether there might be a way to target regulations at new businesses or ones that had been the subject of complaints. The Statesman reported that the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality in 2014 received two complaints about odor and smoke coming from Terry Black‚Äôs Barbecue, and one complaint in 2014 and another in 2015 about an East Austin establishment, la Barbecue. In all cases, the agency determined the odor and smoke were not nuisances subject to state intervention, commission spokeswoman Andrea Morrow said, adding that a nuisance would have to ""be injurious to or adversely affect human health, welfare, animal life, vegetation or property"" or ""interfere with normal use and enjoyment of animal life, vegetation, or property."" On April 2, 2015, council members voted 9-2 to gather input from neighbors and businesses in the lead-up to a ""possible"" writing of smoke-control rules. The issue was to go first to the Economic Opportunity and Health and Human Services committees, both consisting of council members. Specifically, the council‚Äôs resolution said members were initiating a possible amendment to the city code to address smoke from cookers, restaurants and trucks and their impact on residences with provisions to be considered including a requirement that restaurants and mobile vendors using a wood- or charcoal-burning stove or grill and located within 100 feet of a property used or zoned as a residence ""take appropriate action to mitigate the impact of smoke emissions"" on the lives of nearby residents ""by relocating smoke-emitting equipment"" or ""installing smoke-mitigating devices."" The resolution also directed Ott to gather input from affected residents, business owners and others before presenting recommendations to the committees by July 31, 2015. Committee recommendations On May 11, 2015, the Economic Opportunity committee voted 4-0 to not pursue a city ordinance either requiring establishments to install smoke-clearing devices or to regulate nuisances. Instead, the members said that city officials, in conjunction with the state commission, should review concerns case by case. Members acted after taking public comments and fielding a May 4, 2015, city presentation indicating that none of 54 restaurant barbecue smokers in the city already had smoke scrubbers. The other council committee also gathered. But it hadn‚Äôt made a recommendation by the day Limbaugh suggested Austin barbecue was about to vamoose. Then again, Ora Houston, the Austin City Council member who chairs the Health and Human Services panel, earlier made the motion against the city limiting barbecue smoke by ordinance that was adopted by the Economic Opportunity committee. By phone, Houston responded to our inquiry by saying she continues to prefer that the city address smoke concerns one by one. ""I would not be a supporter of a motion to have a citywide ban on barbecue smoke,"" Houston said. ""That‚Äôs what the city is known for, music and barbecue."" Our ruling Limbaugh said Austin is ""effectively"" imposing ""a ban on barbecue restaurants."" In early 2015, there was worry that a mandate that barbecue restaurants limit smoke from smokers would have that impact. However, the council didn‚Äôt adopt such a regulation and we sniffed out no factual indication it‚Äôs poised to do so. Before Limbaugh spoke, the latest panel to make a recommendation suggested city staff tackle complaints one by one--without a change in law. When a claim is not so and seems ridiculous, we see smoke. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE ‚Äì The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

CDC: Kissing and cuddling backyard chickens linked to salmonella infections
","Raising backyard chickens has been satisfying some foodies‚Äô affection for the uber-local egg and lower-fat meat in urban areas, including metro Atlanta, for about a decade. Now the Centers for Disease Control is warning of a downside to the popular trend: salmonella outbreaks traced to some backyard owners kissing and cuddling their flocks. The CDC findings drew some media attention last month, and a PolitiFact reader who heard the health alert on NPR‚Äôs ""Morning Edition"" on July 16 asked us to dig deeper. We went directly to the source, the CDC, which is headquartered in Atlanta and has been investigating four recent Salmonella outbreaks that, as of July 29,¬†had infected 218 people in 41 states. Five of them were in Georgia, 19 were in Alabama, 5 were in North Carolina, 11 were in South Carolina and 6 were in Tennessee. Fifty of the 218 people have required hospitalization for Salmonella, the major symptoms of which are usually diarrhea, fever and abdominal pain. No deaths have been reported, CDC spokeswoman Kristen Nordlund said. So how exactly do CDC officials know that some of these cases are due to backyard breeders kissing and cuddling live poultry? Dr. Megin Nichols, a veterinarian with the CDC, told PolitiFact the agency has been tracking upward trends in both the number of outbreaks and people infected in the past five years and has been working to trace their causes. ""We‚Äôve been trying to interview these people to find out how they are getting sick,"" Nichols said. ""We are finding a certain proportion that are due to very close contact -- something that surprised us here at the CDC."" Salmonella is a germ that lives naturally in the intestine of chickens, ducks and many other animals. It doesn‚Äôt typically make the birds sick, but they can transmit the germs in their droppings and on their feet, feathers and beaks, even when they look clean and healthy, the CDC says. The germs also can get on their cages, coops, feed, water dishes, hay, plants and the area where they live and roam. In addition, the bacteria can rest on the hands, shoes and clothes of those who work around the birds or play with them. And Nichols told us that among the people who became ill between 2008 and 2014 due to baby poultry exposure, 49 percent, or 196 out of 400, reported snuggling and holding baby birds. Another 13 percent, or about 53, reported kissing baby birds, she said. Those people, many of whom were young children, became sick through fecal oral contact, Nichols said. Those same interviews also showed that about 46 percent of backyard breeders are keeping live poultry in their homes, she said. Epidemiologic, laboratory, and traceback findings have linked the most recent four outbreaks of human Salmonella infections to contact with chicks, ducklings, and other live poultry from multiple hatcheries. Interviews have been conducted with 140 of those who were recently ill and, 117, or 84 percent, reported contact with live poultry in the week before their illness began, according to the CDC website. Additional interviews to determine whether that contact included snuggling and kissing have yet to be conducted, Nichols said. An increasing number of people around the country are choosing to keep live poultry - mostly chickens, ducks, turkeys and geese as part of a greener, healthier lifestyle. Local governments, including several in metro Atlanta, have changed their zoning ordinances in recent years to accommodate the trend, and groups of backyard poultry buffs meet regularly in the region to talk chicken. Backyard owners have told reporters at The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that the benefits include fresh eggs and meat, a built-in source of fertilizer for their gardens and ready-made bug-killers. Some say they give their chickens names, the freedom to roam the house and yard and cuddle and coddle them like family pets. The larger problem According to the CDC, salmonella, named for an American scientist who discovered the bacteria, is estimated to cause a million illnesses in the United States a year, with 19,000 hospitalizations and 380 deaths. Most people develop diarrhea and the other conditions within 12 to 72 hour after infection and recover without treatment in four to seven days. It has the potential to turn deadly if it spreads from the intestines to the bloodstream, and then to other body sites. Prompt treatment with antibiotics is critical, and the elderly, infants, and people with impaired immune systems are more likely to have a severe illness. In the largest recent outbreak, which occurred between March 2013 and July 2014, more than 600 people in 29 states and Puerto Rico were infected with seven outbreak strains. The outbreak was associated with one brand of chicken, which led to a company recall of more than 40,000 pounds of chicken products, according to the CDC. To prevent salmonella infections related to backyard farming, the CDC‚Äôs Nichols encourages several common-sense rules. These include thorough handwashing after contact with the chicken, keeping live poultry out of the home, and avoiding snuggling, close contact with the birds‚Äô beaks or other close exposure that would allow ingestion of bacteria. She will be one of the experts featured in a webinar on the topic of practicing backyard bird biosecurity at 7p.m. Thursday. Our conclusion The CDC has issued a warning against kissing or snuggling backyard chickens. It follows four recent Salmonella outbreaks that, as of July 29, had infected 218 people in 41 states. Five of them were in Georgia. Interviews have been conducted with 140 of the ill and 117, or 84 percent, reported contact with live poultry in the week before their illness began, according to the CDC website. The CDC also has evidence from outbreaks between 2008 to 2014. In that period, they found that of the people who became infected with salmonella due to baby poultry exposure, 49 percent, or 196 out of 400 people, reported snuggling and holding baby birds. Another 13 percent, or about 53, reported kissing baby birds.. That‚Äôs cause to sound the alarm.
