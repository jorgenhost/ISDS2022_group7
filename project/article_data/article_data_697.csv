Marcy Kaptur claims Dennis Kucinich voted 'no' on new manufacturing jobs
","
Congressional redistricting in Ohio has left two veteran incumbents, Dennis Kucinich and Marcy Kaptur, facing each other in an increasingly tense Democratic primary.

Kucinich used his opening remarks in a recent debate at the City Club in Cleveland to challenge Kaptur over a TV ad that he said misrepresented his voting record on job creation, veterans' care and prescription drug benefits for seniors.

PolitiFact Ohio took a look and found that the 30-second ad, titled ""No,"" does make three statements about Kucinich's record.

We'll examine them in separate items, starting with the first claim: ""When Marcy Kaptur brought home $42 million for new manufacturing jobs, Dennis Kucinich voted no.""

For that claim, the ad cites as its source the roll call vote of Dec. 16, 2009, on HR 3326, the Defense Appropriations Act for fiscal 2010.

We asked Kaptur's office how she supported her claim of obtaining ""$42 million for new manufacturing jobs.""

Her staff listed 19 projects which she sponsored or co-sponsored that were included in the military spending bill, which passed on the roll call by a vote of 395 to 34, with five members not voting. Kaptur voted yes; Kucinich voted no.

The 19 projects are all directed spending, or earmarks, for Ohio. We confirmed them on the LegiStorm database using information from the group Taxpayers for Common Sense.

They were sponsored by Kaptur alone or with other members of the Ohio delegation, including Republicans and Democrats. Kucinich co-sponsored one of the appropriations, $2 million for research on renewable hydrocarbon fuels for military applications, at the Edison Materials Technology Center in Toledo.

The earmarks totaled more than $59 million in our count.

""We used a conservative estimate,"" Kaptur spokesman Steve Fought said.

In response, Kucinich campaign spokesman Andy Juniewicz noted something else about the military spending act.

""The principal provisions of that bill included $127.3 billion in additional defense spending for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan,"" he said.

Though the measure also included ""a host of other, non-defense-related expenditures,"" he said, Kucinich voted against it as a long-time opponent of the wars.

""He has urged for years that those wars be ended and the troops brought home, and that the hundreds of billions of dollars being spent there be re-directed to support crucial domestic needs, including re-building the nation's infrastructure, improving education, and meeting the health care needs of the uninsured and under-insured,"" Juniewicz said. ""For Kaptur to misrepresent his anti-war vote as a vote against new manufacturing jobs in Northern Ohio is, plainly and deliberately, dishonest.""

Kaptur's campaign called it ""a matter of how you characterize the votes.""

""Those projects were in that bill, and Kucinich voted against them, including one of the projects he had sponsored,"" Fought said. ""He wants to characterize it as an anti-war vote and not an anti-jobs vote.

""In Congress you don't get to cherry pick on legislation. He wants to have it both ways. It's a matter of whether you take responsibility for your final vote or not.""

We think characterization is an issue on both sides.

Kaptur’s statement is partially accurate. Kucinich did vote against the legislation containing the earmarks. But there are important details missing from the claim.

While the measures sponsored by Kaptur were, in fact, appropriations for work to be done on projects in Ohio, her campaign omits important information by characterizing earmarks in the defense budget simply as money ""for new manufacturing jobs.""

Also, legislators frequently face the dilemma of having to vote against programs they would normally support because they are so opposed to other provisions in the same piece of legislation.

Kaptur and Kucinich are longtime colleagues in the House. As such, Kaptur certainly is well aware of Kucinich’s steadfast opposition to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. His vote in this case is consistent with that position.

Characterizing his vote as opposition to spending on programs that could create jobs is simply misleading.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Kaptur’s claim rates Half True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/24/marcy-kaptur/marcy-kaptur-claims-dennis-kucinich-voted-no-new-m/

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama 'could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not.'
","
Mitt Romney told an Arizona debate audience that President Barack Obama’s most ""serious failure"" as president has been ""his failure to deal with Iran appropriately.""

""We simply cannot allow Iran to have nuclear weaponry ..."" Romney said at the Feb. 22, 2012, Republican presidential debate in Mesa, Ariz. ""This president ... could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not.""

Obama signed new U.S. sanctions against Iran in December. We wondered: What did Romney mean by ""could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran""? And is that true?

Romney’s statement

Romney’s criticism came as part of his answer to an audience question about how candidates planned to deal ""with the growing nuclear threat from Iran.""

Romney answered: 
For this fact-check, we’re focusing on the claim, ""this president ... could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not.""

First, a little background. Iran has faced U.S. sanctions since its 1979 Islamic revolution. The United Nations and other nations have joined in sanctions since 2006 in response to Iran’s efforts to develop a nuclear weapon, according to the Congressional Research Service, which provides nonpartisan analysis to Congress. The Obama administration’s policy has been to combine sanctions with negotiations. But since Iran has yet to compromise, the administration has sought ""additional U.S., U.N., and allied country sanctions whose cumulative effect could compel Iran to accept a nuclear bargain.""

That includes signing into law on Dec. 31, 2011, a bill that sanctions foreign financial institutions that do business with the Central Bank of Iran. The country now has the ""most sweeping sanctions on Iran of virtually any country in the world,"" according to a February 2012 Congressional Research Service report.

Have the sanctions achieved the core goal of changing Iran’s commitment to its nuclear program? No. But they are weakening Iran’s economy, raising the possibility that Iran’s stance ""might be in the process of reassessment,"" the report says.

And that’s exactly what Romney has said the goal would be when he used the phrase ""crippling sanctions"" in the past, such as at a Nov. 22, 2011 presidential debate: ""The right course in America is to stand up to Iran with crippling sanctions ... put in place the kind of crippling sanctions that stop their economy.""

Iran’s economy was already ""in turmoil,"" according to the Carnegie Endowment for Peace in March 2010, in part due to ""biting external sanctions."" President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said in November 2011 that sanctions were causing significant problems for the nation’s banking sector — after new U.N. and U.S. sanctions signed by Obama in 2010, but before U.S. sanctions on the country’s Central Bank. After the new sanctions were imposed, the nation’s currency took a steep slide.

What Romney’s campaign says

We asked Romney’s campaign for support for his statement that the president, ""could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran.""

He was arguing two things, spokesman Ryan Williams said — that the president ""failed to secure a range of sanctions"" from the United Nations in 2010, and that he has resisted congressional efforts to impose tough sanctions.

Both of those arguments have weaknesses. And neither fully support the statement ""this president ... could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not.""

What the U.N. did 
The United Nations in 2010 voted to sanction Iran but didn’t include among those sanctions measures against the nation’s Central Bank because of opposition from Russia and China. The argument that the president ""could have"" gotten tougher sanctions suggests it was Obama’s choice, rather than diplomatic reality.

""The real issue is that Russia and China would not go along with anything stronger than what the U.S. got in 2010. So the U.S. was stuck,"" said Leonard Spector of the Monterey Institute of International Studies at Middlebury College.

Romney has argued that Obama should have leveraged Russia’s desire for removal of missile defense sites in Eastern Europe — but instead ""got nothing in return."" But he hasn’t offered a similar inducement he feels could have been used to convince China, which said it wouldn’t support any measure it felt would harm world economic recovery or affect the Iranian people or normal trade, according to the New York Times.

""Unless Gov. Romney has some ideas for how he would have appealed more to the Chinese and the Russians, it's hard to criticize the president's performance at the U.N,"" said Michael Levi, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""The amount of effort this administration put into getting multilateral sanctions at the U.N. Security Council was extraordinary.""

The administration instead said it would push forward with tougher sanctions on its own. And it did — with the president signing into law at least two new rounds of sanctions and an executive order toughening the U.S. position.

What Congress did 
But Romney’s campaign argues that Congress deserves full credit for recent efforts, such as the legislation targeting the Central Bank. Tougher sanctions imposed by the United States in the past few months ""weren’t done by Obama,"" but through an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that Obama opposed, tried to water down, and won exceptions for, Romney’s spokesman said.

(The administration argued the amendment, which passed despite the administration's objections, could ""alienate foreign countries, make it more difficult to pressure Iran and raise oil prices, which could actually help the Iranian economy,"" according to Foreign Policy’s The Cable.)

""In implementing them, he was only doing what he was required to by an act of Congress,"" Williams said.

Meanwhile, Obama wrote a signing statement saying that the sanction’s requirements were nonbinding, Williams noted.  (Obama wrote that the Iran sanctions section ""would interfere with my constitutional authority to conduct foreign relations by directing the Executive to take certain positions in negotiations or discussions with foreign governments. Like section 1244, should any application of these provisions conflict with my constitutional authorities, I will treat the provisions as non-binding."")

Obama also undermined the sanctions’ requirement for countries seeking exceptions to ""significantly reduce"" their Iranian crude oil purchases by leaving the definition of ""significant"" to the discretion of the secretary of state, Williams said. (Sens. Robert Menendez, D-N.J., and Mark Kirk, R-Ill., authors of the amendment, argued it should mean at least 18 percent.)

Levi of the Council on Foreign Relations says that’s not evidence of a weak stance on Iran or sanctions — but resistance to letting Congress dictate the terms.

""This is the sort of thing where there are so many variables that any rigid set of rules is almost certain to miss certain … elements of reality,"" he said. ""Flexibility is the watchword. It's really hard to argue that this administration hasn't brought strong pressure to bear on Iran.""

Leonard Spector of the Monterey Institute of International Studies at Middlebury College agreed that the administration has been a driving force internationally to put pressure on Iran, even if it failed to get the U.N. to target Iran’s Central Bank.

""Obama unilaterally and in concert with the E.U. and other allies has gone much further,""  he said.

Spector argues that isolation of the Iranian Central Bank, a cutoff of Iranian crude oil purchases that the United States won agreement to by the European Union and others and the pending decision of Brussels-based global electronic money transfer system SWIFT to deny Iran access to international check clearing ""are indeed going to be crippling.""

""This is not being done through the U.N., but it is most definitely the result of the U.S. leading the way and pressing for these measures,"" he said.

Spector, who worked on nonproliferation issues for the Department of Energy under the Clinton administration, said ""a good deal of leadership"" has been behind the scenes. In summer 2010, the European Union, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea all adopted sanctions that went well beyond what the U.N. required. That was all coordinated by the United States, he said.

Avner Cohen, a senior fellow at the Monterey Institute of International Studies, said you might fairly argue that the administration could have pursued tougher sanctions outside the U.N. Security Council — such as against Iran’s Central Bank — earlier.

But that’s not what Romney said.

""If Romney refers to U.N. Security Council sanctions, four waves of sanctions have passed so far. I do not think that more crippling sanctions could have passed …"" Cohen said.  ""As typical for political statements, it has some ring of truth, but it is vague and overstated.""

Our ruling

Mitt Romney said, ""this president ... could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran. He did not."" The reality is that a combination of international and U.S. efforts are now in place that some consider crippling to Iran’s economy. Romney's campaign argues he was specifically referring to a failure to get the United Nations to enact sanctions against Iran’s Central Bank in 2010. But some experts argue he couldn’t have achieved tougher U.N. sanctions, given opposition from Russia and China. Meanwhile, Romney’s campaign argues Obama hasn’t fully supported U.S. sanctions against Iran. It’s true that Obama resisted Congress dictating the administration’s strategy. But that’s not support for the statement that he ""could have gotten crippling sanctions against Iran"" but ""did not."" We rate Romney’s statement Mostly False.

Gas prices are $6 a gallon in Florida, says Ron Paul
","
There’s no doubt gas prices in Florida have been on the rise -- but have they really hit $6 a gallon?

That was the surprising claim from Ron Paul at the Republican presidential debate in Arizona on Feb. 22, 2012.

It started with CNN moderator John King asking candidates what should be done about Syria.

Paul, a congressman from Texas, was making a point about the downside of U.S. intervention in foreign countries, which led to an aside about gas prices.

""You know, I've tried the moral argument. I've tried the constitutional argument on these issues. And they don't go so well. But there's an economic argument, as well,"" Paul said.

""As a matter of fact, al-Qaida has had a plan to bog us down in the Middle East and bankrupt this country. That's exactly what they're doing. We've spent $4 trillion of debt in the last 10 years being bogged down in the Middle East. The neoconservatives who now want us to be in Syria, want us to go to Iran, have another war, and we don't have the money -- today gasoline hit $6 a gallon in Florida -- and we don't have the money.""

International geopolitics is one thing, but $6 gas hits close to home. So we decided to check it out.

We emailed the Paul campaign, but we didn’t hear back. Still, it didn’t take long to find some likely suspects for sources. The Drudge Report, for example, featured the headline ""$6 gas"" just a few hours before the debate’s start. The Drudge Report’s link sent readers to a Tampa television station's report that a couple of gas stations in Florida are charging close to $6 a gallon.

The report’s source was GasBuddy.com, a website that tracks prices by gas station so consumers can find the cheapest prices and avoid the highest. Sure enough, when we checked GasBuddy the morning after the debate, we found one gas station that was charging $5.79 a gallon and another that was charging $5.69. (You can read user reviews on Yelp.com for the two gas stations here and here.)

So that’s two gas stations out of the entire state. Every other gas station charged much less, with the next highest at $4.35.

Most notably, those two gas stations are suspiciously close to the beating heart of Florida tourism -- the international airport that brings visitors to Walt Disney World.

""Florida residents know better than to get gas there. It's entirely to clip the tourists,"" said Gregg Laskoski, an analyst with GasBuddy. Citing those two stations ""totally exaggerates the gas prices situation here in Florida.""

Laskoski told us it’s not the first time a few stations have given the wrong impression about gas prices statewide.

""Every year, these stories about a couple of gas stations in the Orlando area pop up, to represent extreme gas stations,"" he said. ""This is not a new story; it's an old story with a new price.""

Statewide averages are high by historical standards but much lower than Paul's scary $6 figure. The day after the debate, GasBuddy was reporting the average Florida price as $3.70.

AAA’s Fuel Gauge Report set the average Florida price similarly, at $3.70 for a gallon of regular unleaded.

Jessica Brady, a spokesperson for AAA, said $6 a gallon was not accurate. And while average gas prices are going up, she said she didn’t expect them to hit $6, at least not anytime soon.

""It is going up, and it's expected to continue to go up into the spring and the summer,"" Brady said. ""It's possible by spring we could see prices at $4 a gallon.""

Brady blamed the rising gas prices on mounting tensions with Iran; economic instability in Europe; fluctuating expectations of economic growth in the United States; and seasonal refinery maintenance.

We also spoke with Izzy Rommes, director of the division of standards at the Florida Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services, which regulates gasoline.

He said he wasn’t familiar with the Orlando gas stations in question, but said the state generally only acts on complaints of price gouging during hurricanes or other natural disasters.

""The market controls the price of gas absent a declaration of emergency,"" he said. ""As long as the price is disclosed, there's nothing wrong with it.""

Finally, we spoke with ""Bob,"" last name unknown, who answered the phone at Suncoast Energys, one of the gas stations in question. No one there wanted to answer our questions, he said. He added that the station hasn’t changed its prices since May of last year.

Our ruling

Florida drivers can take a small measure of gratitude in the fact that gas prices are not at $6 a gallon. 
Or $5 a gallon. 
Or $4 a gallon. 
The statewide average is $3.70. 
(One note of caution: If you need to fill up near the Orlando airport, shop around!) 
As for Paul, we suspect he read headlines that gave the wrong impression on Florida gas prices. In fact, we found only two of approximately 7,100 gas stations that even come close to the price he cites. 
We wouldn't bring a flaming Truth-O-Meter to a filling station, but that's what this one deserves. Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2012/feb/23/ron-paul/gas-prices-are-6-gallon-florida-says-ron-paul/
"['Oregon', 'Health Care', 'Public Health', 'Alan Bates']","
Does 20% of the population really use 80% of health care dollars?
","
Health care debates are always fertile ground for fact-checkable claims. A recent debate on the Oregon Senate floor over the state’s reform plans was no different.

During the debate, Sen. Alan Bates was trying to argue the point that the state’s health care system needs to focus on the folks who are highest cost and better integrate their care. A small portion of folks use the most resources, he said, so better organization, more working together, should make a dent in overall costs.

""We spend twice as much money per person in the U.S. than any industrialized country in the world and yet we have the worst outcomes,"" he said. ""Our health care system is literally awash in dollars.""

Same old, same old. But then he said something that really caught our attention: ""Eighty percent of the health care dollars are spent by 20 percent of the population.""

We remembered this 80-20 rule from economics class. Quite a few things are said to split that way. Business owners, for instance, sometimes say that just 20 percent of their clientele account for 80 percent of their sales.

But we hadn’t heard the rule applied to health care -- and, honestly, we weren’t even sure the ""rule"" held up to scrutiny.

So we gave Bates’ office a call. An aide there said that the 80-20 split was general knowledge, and that the senator heard it recently from the director of the Oregon Health Authority. That led us to OHA spokeswoman Karynn Fish, who pointed us to two sources. The first was an Oregonian article by Bill Graves that was about this topic exactly: high-cost patients.

In his story, Graves notes that at CareOregon, a Portland managed care organization for Oregon Health Plan, about 25 percent of the adult patients accounted for 83 percent of the spending in 2011. That number seemed to reflect the same general principle Bates had mentioned during the floor session.

Debra Read, a senior evaluation associate with CareOregon, said the figure was fairly standard across the board when it comes to health care -- though she couldn’t say whether it also applied to children. ""That’s well supported, not just in our data.""

The reason for the high cost of a few, she said, comes down to hospital visits, where most people wind up when they’re managing a chronic condition or they’re in the last stages of a terminal illness. ""When you look at health care costs overall, the hospital is the thing that costs the most, vastly costs the most. … So it’s basically driven by hospital costs. The sicker you are, the more likely you are to go to the hospital.""

The second source that Fish gave us was a chart from the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services’ Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. That chart showed exactly what Bates said: Twenty percent of the population accounts for 80 percent of total expenditures. Maybe even more shockingly, the chart also shows that just 5 percent of the population accounts for 50 percent of all expenditures.

The agency cited several studies for the chart, with publication dates running from 2002 through 2006. To get a more current take on the situation, we phoned Stephanie Bernell, a professor with Oregon State University’s Health Management and Policy Program who specializes in the economics of health care.

She said the 80-20 split was ""a very reasonable thing for somebody to say."" She cited a fuller report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality that further explored the way in which a minority of Americans account for the largest bulk of spending.

Bernell said she was even more interested in whittling down that 20 percent, noting again that just 5 percent account for 49 percent of health care expenses. ""I think the stories are more interesting when you get into who’s in that 20 percent, "" she said.

People consume the most health care at the beginning and the end of life, she said. Births are expensive and so is the latter part of life when ""chronic conditions start to creep up.""

That brings us to our ruling. Bates said that 20 percent of the population accounts for 80 percent of the health care dollars spent. His claim is backed up by two studies from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. That data is a little old, but newer numbers from CareOregon show the same split and a professor who studies the issue also confirmed the senator’s claim. We give this statement a True.

Rick Santorum charts explosion of federal entitlement spending since 1958
","
During the Feb. 22, 2012, presidential debate in Mesa, Ariz., Rick Santorum offered some historical comparisons of the federal budget.

""When I was born"" -- which was 1958 -- ""less than 10 percent of the federal budget was entitlement spending. It's now 60 percent of the budget. Some people have suggested that defense spending is the problem. When I was born, defense spending was 60 percent of the budget. It's now 17 percent. If you think defense spending is the problem, then you need a remedial math class to go back to.""

We’ll split these claims into two separate items. Here, we’ll look at whether in 1958, ""less than 10 percent of the federal budget was entitlement spending. It's now 60 percent of the budget.""

We turned to data from the Office of Management and Budget. OMB provides historical figures for federal payments to individuals, including payments for such entitlement programs as Social Security and Medicare.

In 1958, such payments accounted for 25.4 percent of the federal budget -- more than double what Santorum said.

In fiscal year 2011, the comparable percentage was 65.1 percent, which is in the ballpark for what Santorum claimed.

This growth is not too surprising, since Medicare and Medicaid were signed into law in 1965 -- when Santorum was 7  years old -- and now occupy an increasing share of the federal budget. During that time, the U.S. population has grown significantly, as well.

Our ruling

Santorum is close on the current percentage of the federal budget going to entitlements, but he understates the figure for his birth year. This makes the expansion, which is dramatic in any case, seem even more so.

Rick Santorum says defense spending has fallen since 1958 as percent of federal budget

""When I was born"" -- which was 1958 -- ""less than 10 percent of the federal budget was entitlement spending. It's now 60 percent of the budget.

We turned to data from the Office of Management and Budget. OMB provides historical figures for breaking down federal spending.

In 1958, the percentage of the federal budget going to national defense was 56.8 percent. That’s pretty close to what Santorum said.

In fiscal year 2011, the percentage was 19.6 percent, which is also somewhat close to what Santorum said.

This trend is not too surprising, since entitlement spending has grown dramatically since 1958. Defense spending has also declined as a percentage of gross domestic product, though not as dramatically as it has when measured against the overall budget. In 1958, defense spending accounted for 10.2 percent of GDP, compared to 4.7 today.

However, in inflation-adjusted dollars, U.S. spending on defense has actually increased significantly. In 1958, the U.S. spent the equivalent of $371 billion, compared to $612 billion in 2011. If you subtract war funding in 2011 -- since the U.S. was not involved in overseas combat in 1958 -- the figure was still higher in 2011, at about $497 billion, said Todd Harrison, a fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments.

Our ruling

As his benchmark, Santorum chose defense spending as a percentage of the federal budget. He could have chosen other measures, such as defense spending as a percentage of GDP or annual spending in inflation-adjusted dollars, and they would have showed different patterns. But we think the measurement is credible, and his choice of it is reasonable. Because his numbers are close, but not exact, we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/23/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-says-defense-spending-has-fallen-195/

House committee chairman claims state agency delivered coyotes to cull deer population
","
At a hearing on wildlife management laws, members of the  House Conservation and Environment Committee turned from discussion of a wild hog eradication program now under way to other animals that can cause problems for people.

""Let’s talk about the coyotes,"" said Rep. Frank Niceley, R-Strawberry Plains, a member of the committee and chairman of the House Agriculture Committee.

""The TWRA (Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency) brought the coyotes in here to control the deer herd. Their biologists are not dumb. They knew these deer, in an ideal situation like this, would explode (in population),"" he said. ""So they brought these coyotes in here to try to keep the deer population down. Now, these coyotes, they will kill calves. … It’s a huge problem. I have 80 head of sheep, and the coyotes got into them and they killed 60 head of sheep before I could get them behind a tight fence. …  The coyotes, when they get thick enough, will start getting kids out of the yard.""

In the past, TWRA has engaged in well-known and successful programs to stock deer and wild turkeys  into Tennessee, where native populations were virtually wiped out in the 1800s. But we hadn’t heard about coyote stocking.

When initially asked whether TWRA had imported coyotes into the state, where they did not appear until sometime in the late 1960s or early 1970s, the agency’s assistant executive director, Nat Johnson, at first had trouble taking the query seriously.

""Actually, we sent some officers over to Arkansas and gave them swimming lessons,"" he said. ""After we taught them, coyotes could swim over the Mississippi River.""

Dropping the sarcasm, Johnson said he did not believe Niceley was correct, but referred the question for a more authoritative answer to Steve Patrick, TWRA’s assistant director of field operations.

Patrick, a 35-year veteran of the agency, said his job over the years positioned him to know if TWRA had ever been involved in any coyote relocation and, no, that had never happened. But he said it is a fairly common myth.

""That and that we’re releasing rattlesnakes, too,"" he said, adding that TWRA has never engaged in rattlesnake relocation either.

Niceley, advised that TWRA disputed his contention, said he has heard reports of coyote transplants attributed to ""early biologists back in the 1970s."" Further, he said the agency at least collaborated with a federal project to re-introduce red wolves into Tennessee and ""red wolves and coyotes have the same DNA.""

The latter reference is to an effort by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Park Service, launched in 1991, to establish red wolves in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park.
The effort failed and was abandoned in 1998, according to a news release issued by the federal agencies at the time.

Patrick said TWRA was aware of the red wolf project, but had no involvement whatsoever. Few pups from the transplanted red wolves survived. The release says at least one was killed by coyotes.

Dr. Michael Kennedy, a professor of biology at the University of Memphis who has done extensive research on coyotes since 1975, including some under contract for TWRA, said that today’s remnant red wolves do share some DNA with coyotes, though ""taxonomically, they’re different."" Coyotes are also known, on occasion, to interbreed with dogs, he said.

But in Tennessee, he said, ""about 95 percent of what we have are true coyotes"" without any genetic kinship to other canines. His research indicates Tennessee coyotes are genetically the same as those from states to the west and they arrived through ""natural dispersal.""

""There’s no question that the TWRA – or anyone else, for that matter  – is not responsible for coyotes moving into Tennessee,"" he said.

Kennedy also says that coyotes are generally not good enough at catching deer to serve as an effective control of deer populations. While they can and do kill fawns and ailing animals, deer are a small part of the average coyote’s diverse diet, he said.

Coyotes, once confined to the western states, have spread into all states east of the Mississippi. And apparently the notion of them being introduced by wildlife agencies is not unique to Tennessee.

The Pennsylvania Game Commission, in fact, was concerned enough to include a denial of stocking in an article about coyotes on its website.

""Some folks actually believe the agency has stocked coyotes in recent years to reduce deer numbers. Nothing could be further from the truth,"" says the article.

Our ruling

In relying on an unsubstantiated urban myth (or shall we say a ""rural myth"" in this case?) Niceley broke what should be a cardinal rule of public speaking -- make sure there is some shred of truth to a claim you are making. This one has been debunked before elsewhere and deserves to be again. When questioned, Niceley fell back to the history of red wolves, but even that displayed a misunderstanding of what actually was a federal program that experts said was unsuccessful.

Niceley’s statement is definitely a real howler -- Pants On Fire.",/factchecks/2012/feb/23/frank-niceley/house-committee-chairman-claims-state-agency-deliv/

Despite resistance from some educators, including a lawsuit filed by the teachers’ union, state Rep. Bill Proctor, R-St. Augustine, stood firm behind Senate Bill 736. Proctor is the chair of a House education committee and chancellor at Flagler College.

""Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level, and grade level isn’t that difficult,"" Proctor said in comments to the St. Augustine Record. ""We’ll see which teachers affect learning in their students.""

We were surprised by that statistic: Do half of Florida’s high school graduates head off to college or work without reading at grade level?

Florida’s seniors aren’t tested for reading skills as they don their caps and gowns. But we found two compelling pieces of evidence that indicate Proctor is probably right.

FCAT and college entrance exams 
Florida high school students take the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT, in the 10th grade. 
Proctor’s office sent us to the most-recent 10th grade FCAT results. A ""3 or higher"" is considered reading at grade level.  During the 2010-11 school year, only 39 percent of nearly 186,000 10th graders scored that well. 
But 60 percent passed the test, which means it’s possible to pass the test and read below grade level. Students are required to pass the 10th grade FCAT to graduate.

Students who fail have two opportunities per year to retake the test which would ultimately boost that 39 percent figure who scored at grade level. The retest data mixes students from different years, though, so we can’t give a definitive number for how many more students passed the FCAT in a specific graduating class.

""Yes, we graduate students that cannot read on 10th grade reading level,"" said Lindy Smith, an aide to Proctor, in an email. ""Of those students passing the 10th grade Reading FCAT, I do not know how many actually graduated - but as you know students must pass 10th grade Reading FCAT in order to graduate. We expect some growth in reading in grades 11 and 12 but do not test those results on FCAT.""

The other piece of evidence came from the Florida Department of Education. Staff there pointed us to a December 2011 report on school assessment standards.

The report stated that to be ""college ready"" students must graduate from high school, take certain courses and demonstrate basic literary skills. During the 2009-10 school year, 55 percent of the graduating seniors scored college ready for reading based on the ACT, SAT or CPT (The CPT, or College Placement Test, is primary used for the state’s public community colleges.) That number, too, supports Proctor’s claim.

Experts on testing and education 
If the number of students reading at grade level is so abysmally low, why the repeated push for testing?

We posed that question to Matthew Ladner, a senior advisor of policy and research for the Foundation for Excellence in Education (chaired by former Gov. Jeb Bush). Ladner
coauthored Report Card on American Education: Ranking State K-12 Performance, Progress and Reform for the American Legislative Exchange Council.

Without the testing, Florida wouldn’t have a measurement of its students’ performance, he said. And although no one is happy about that 39 percent figure of students reading at grade level in the 10th grade, Florida has made gains. Ladner pointed to the National Assessment of Education Progress which tests samples of students. Florida’s fourth grade reading results were below the national average in 1998, but climbed enough by 2011 to be above the national average.

""What you find is while there is still plenty of room for improvement in Florida, there has been a large amount of progress in the right direction,"" he said.

We also spoke with Robert Schaeffer, public education director of FairTest, a national organization which advocates for better forms of assessment. Schaeffer said that Proctor’s claim sounded accurate, but he said that what constitutes ""grade level"" isn’t objective criteria.

""Grade level is a political construct,"" he said. ""If you gave the FCAT to many competent adults they would fail.""

Schaeffer also said that the SAT and other college entrance exams are given to students who are already college bound, so that measure doesn’t provide a full picture -- for example students who have dropped out.

The State Board of Education approves the achievement level descriptions for FCAT 2.0.

Our ruling

Proctor said ""Right now, 50 percent of Florida students leaving high school cannot read at grade level."" The results for 10th grade reading FCAT show only 39 percent at grade level. Some additional students met that grade level mark through retests or by a sufficient score on the SAT or ACT, which would boost that 39 percent figure. Another way to measure Proctor’s claim is by looking at the percentage who were deemed college ready for reading based on college entrance exams, and that figure was 55 percent for 2009-10. By both measurements, the figure is close to 50 percent. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/feb/23/bill-proctor/rep-proctor-says-half-high-school-grads-cant-read-/

Senate Dems claim Christie wrongly takes credit for businesses' moves to New Jersey
","
In emphasizing New Jersey’s economic road to recovery, Gov. Chris Christie gave a shoutout to three companies during his State of the State address in January, associating their locations with his ""Jersey Comeback"" theme.

Specifically, Christie noted that Bayer put its North American headquarters in Morris County, Novo Nordisk came to Middlesex County and LG Electronics to Bergen County.

Senate Democrats also issued a shoutout on the matter, but theirs wasn’t as flattering as the governor’s.

""The governor is trying to take credit for recent actions taken by these companies,"" the Democrats said in a Jan. 18 news release. ""The problem is that for all three companies, the decision to move or stay in New Jersey happened before Chris Christie became governor.""

The Democrats correctly note that all three companies decided to make New Jersey home before Christie became governor, but at least two of the firms announced expansions after he took office, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

First, let’s look at when each company came to New Jersey.

Christie was elected governor in November 2009 and took office in January 2010.

LG Electronics came to Englewood Cliffs as part of a reorganization, according to a press release it issued in 2004. Bayer announced in 2007 that its U.S. headquarters would be in New Jersey. A year later, Novo Nordisk announced an expansion of its U.S. headquarters in Princeton.

So the three companies began putting down roots in the Garden State before Christie was elected governor.

But that doesn’t mean his office hasn’t had any involvement with keeping those firms here.

In Bayer’s case, the pharmaceutical giant announced in April that New Jersey would also become the ""home"" of Bayer HealthCare’s consolidated East-Coast business site. Bayer has a contingent purchase agreement for a property in Whippany, according to spokeswoman Rosemarie Yancosek. The deal is in the due diligence process, she said in an e-mail.

Christie spokesman Michael Drewniak did not respond to our request for comment but the governor said in an April Bayer news release, ""Bayer’s commitment to stay and expand in New Jersey is another signal that our state is growing and that this administration’s job creating policies are paying dividends. Bayer’s planned investment in New Jersey will help keep us the premier state in the nation for the pharmaceutical industry in addition to creating needed jobs and giving a boost to our state’s economy.""

Novo Nordisk spokesman Ken Inchausti told us in an e-mail that the Danish pharmaceutical company last October announced plans for another expansion, on Scudders Mill Road in Plainsboro.

It’s worth noting that the Democrats cited Novo Nordisk’s move to Princeton in their Jan. 18 release, but that’s in Mercer County. Christie’s address cited the company’s location in Middlesex County, which is the Plainsboro expansion announced three months ago.

Democrats spokesman Chris Donnelly declined to comment further on the release, which doesn’t clarify whether Christie was talking about the businesses’ initial arrival in New Jersey or expansion plans. But the governor’s words do give an impression that the companies are new to the state.

""People are recognizing the New Jersey Comeback all around the world … Bayer put its North American headquarters in Morris County, Novo Nordisk in Middlesex County, and LG Electronics in Bergen County,"" Christie said in his address.

LG Electronics did not respond to requests for comment.

Our ruling

The state Senate Democrats issued a news release in January claiming that Christie, in his State of the State address, was trying to take credit for Bayer, Novo Nordisk and LG Electronics coming to New Jersey under the ""Jersey Comeback"" heading. We found that the three companies arrived in New Jersey before Christie became governor and anyone heard of a ""Jersey Comeback,"" but Bayer and Novo Nordisk announced expansion plans after Christie’s election. We rate the statement Mostly True.

U.S. Chamber says George Allen cut spending and waste as governor
","
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce recently launched a television ad lauding the fiscal record of George Allen, who is seeking this year’s Republican nomination in Virginia for the U.S. Senate.

The 30-second spot praises Allen for supporting tax cuts when he was a senator from 2001 to 2007. ""And as Virginia’s governor, Allen cut spending and waste with bipartisan support,"" the ad says.

Did Allen cut spending and waste as governor?  

U.S. Chamber officials did not respond to our repeated phone calls and emails. So we relied on state budget records and a small amount of background material the Chamber cited in its ad.

When Allen took office in January 1994, he inherited an overall $14.7 billion budget for the fiscal year that started the previous July 1. At the end of his term, in January 1998, he left behind  a $20.7 billion proposed budget for the fiscal year that started the following July 1. That means Allen endorsed $6 billion in additional spending when he was governor -- a 40.7 percent increase.

But looking at overall spending may be unfair. Slightly more than half of the outlays during Allen’s years came from the non-general fund, over which a governor has limited control. The fund consists of earmarked revenues such as college tuition and federal highway grants.

A better gauge, as we’ve noted before, comes from examining the general fund, which pays for public education, health programs and public safety. It’s mostly supported by state income and sales taxes.

The general fund was almost $6.8 billion when Allen took office. At the end of his term, he proposed a $9.9 billion general fund for the budget year beginning July 1, 1998. That means Allen endorsed $3.1 billion in additional general fund spending when he was governor -- a 45.6.percent rise.

Although the general fund growth under Allen may sound gigantic, it was about average for a Virginia governor. The general fund budget has grown by 479 percent over the last 30 years, from almost $2.7 billion in 1981 to almost $15.5 billion this fiscal year.

Many factors explain the expansion: population has grown, creating greater revenues and a greater demand for services; Medicaid costs have increased dramatically, often by 10 percent a year; and inflation.

Allen tried to slow the growth by proposing a $2.1 billion tax cut in early 1995. The measure was opposed by the business community and defeated by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. After that point, Allen had little choice but to spend the revenues coming in.

So how does does the U.S. Chamber square the general fund increases with its claim that Allen cut spending and waste with bipartisan support?

Fine print in the Chamber’s ad refers to a story in The Washington Post on Feb. 25, 1995, that was headlined ""Allen Announces Deal on Welfare."" The article detailed an agreement Allen struck with lawmakers to require welfare recipients to gradually return to work.

The legislation, considered a key Allen accomplishment, passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. The Department of Social Services estimated in 2007 that welfare reform saved the state $957 million over its first 12 years.

So the Chamber is not basing its claim that Allen that cut spending and waste on the bottom line of the state budget. It is referring to a program that Allen cut.

Allen, while acknowledging that total spending increased during his administration, says he found savings by streamlining parts of Virginia government. In addition to welfare reform, he points a reduction in the state workforce and the repeal of many regulations.

Throughout his campaign for governor and his term in office, Allen criticized the bureaucracy and the state regulations for wasting taxpayers’ dollars. As we noted in a previous Truth-O-Meter item, Allen trimmed the executive branch, which represents the bulk of state workers, by 10,000 employees, or 9 percent. But the state’s reliance on private contractors also grew significantly during his administration. The state did not keep records that allow a bottom-line analysis of Allen’s workforce policies.

Our ruling

Last August, we gave a False rating to Allen’s unqualified boast of ""reigning in"" state spending when he was governor. Spending continued its normal growth pattern during Allen’s term.

Now, the national Chamber of Commerce, in a TV ad, says ""Allen cut spending and waste with bipartisan support"" when he was governor. There is some qualification in this statement.

The claim does not square with the big picture left by Allen’s administration. General fund spending rose by 45.6 percent from the budget Allen inherited in 1994 to the one left behind in 1998. It should be noted that Allen’s major effort to control spending was thwarted by the Democratic-controlled legislature, and the growth under Allen was about average for a Virginia governor.

The Chamber, however, is focusing on a detail in the big picture. In the ad’s fine print, the group backs its statement by citing welfare reform championed by Allen in 1995. The law passed with strong bipartisan support and is credited with saving Virginia  $957 million over its first 12 years.

Beyond the Chamber’s footnote, Allen could legitimately claim to have saved the Commonwealth money through some of his actions to pare the state workforce and regulations.

So the claim is partially accurate, but omits the important point that bottom line spending went up significantly during the Allen years. We rate the statement Half True.

"['Oregon', 'State Budget', 'Bruce Starr']","
Do other states, federal government have legislative commissions to retire executive branch agencies?
","
Oregon Sen. Bruce Starr, R-Hillsboro, was shut down by Democrats on the floor when he tried to extract a dead bill from committee. The legislation? To create a legislative committee to regularly review the need for state agencies, or else the agencies would expire on a rolling basis.

In a remonstrance -- otherwise known as an expression of protest or complaint -- he said that such a committee would strengthen the legislative body.

""It is, without question, a process that this Legislature hasn’t contemplated in the past,"" he said. ""Other states have. The federal government does. It would allow accountability in the process. Mr. President, and I would urge that in the future legislatures, that we consider this particular issue in a way that would be bipartisan and recognize the goal is to strengthen the Legislative Assembly.""

Do other states regularly allow agencies to lapse unless lawmakers approve them? Does the federal government have such a commission itself? Majority Democrats in the Senate voted down Starr’s motion without discussion, but the questions for PolitiFact Oregon remained.

In a follow-up interview, Starr said he got the idea from Texas, which has had a long-running sunset commission. He also clarified that the federal government does not have one commission overseeing multiple agencies, but that Congress regularly reviews certain spending provisions. And Starr owned up, as he did on the floor, to the reality that he didn’t expect the idea to move.

An online search shows that the Texas Legislature created the Sunset Advisory Commission in 1977 ""to identify and eliminate waste, duplication, and inefficiency in government agencies."" The 12-member commission reviews more than 150 government agencies every 12 years.

Florida created one in 2006. California did in 2010. Minnesota followed last year when its 2011 Legislature created a Sunset Advisory Commission, which will periodically review state agencies and make recommendations on whether the agency should continue to exist. Most commissions and boards would expire automatically unless authorized; larger agencies would not expire automatically.

""Sunset committees"" were something of a trend in the 1960s and 1970s, when many state legislatures were struggling for equal footing with the other branches of government, says Brenda Erickson, a senior research analyst with the National Conference of State Legislatures.

In 1977, the Oregon Legislature created a sunset committee, the Associated Press reported, and hired staff to review nine state agencies slated to be killed by mid-1980 unless the 1979 Legislature voted to keep them. Legislators voted to kill the committee in 1993.

Erickson said many states found the sunset schedule hard to maintain. ""Given staff limitations, they found it difficult to keep up,"" she said. ""They modified the sunset review period, and extended it, or removed it and transitioned into this (performance) review.""

Most states have some kind of legislative authority to audit or review executive branch agencies, according to a 2008 survey conducted by NCSL. According to the Council of State Governments' Book of the States 2011, which uses 2009 data, about half of states have a sunset-type body.

Congress is a different story; attempts to create an oversight commission haven’t succeeded. Republicans appear keener on the idea than Democrats. So there is no one commission currently in Congress that regularly reviews the need for federal agencies. But many, if not most, spending provisions for farms, defense, aviation, etc., technically require reauthorization or review every few years to continue.

""The federal government does terminate a fair number of programs each year,""  said Scott Lilly, a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, but generally this is done through the appropriations process. Most of those are ""small demonstration projects,"" he said.

The left-leaning group doesn’t like the idea of a congressional sunset commission, but that’s neither here nor there for us. We’re not going to weigh in on whether the idea has merit. Starr said on the floor that other states have sunset oversight commissions, or had considered them. He said that the federal government does. His language on the floor was broad, although the bill in question, Senate Bill 1590, has some very strict dates on abolishing agencies.

What do we know?

Sunset committees were very popular with state legislatures, then became not as popular, and now may be making a comeback. It’s accurate to say that other states have contemplated the idea or have one.

But it’s not accurate to suggest that the federal government has an oversight commission. The ability to review specific spending every few years isn’t the same thing as a broad-based commission with the power to kill agencies. Starr acknowledged as much in an interview with PolitiFact Oregon.

His language on the floor was a little foggy and he clarified his comments in an interview. We don’t find this to be a significant piece of missing information, but feel readers should know the difference.

Rick Santorum says you can’t “name one time in the last 20 years that the French stood by us with anything”
","
At a presidential campaign event in Georgetown, Ohio, on Feb. 17, 2012, Rick Santorum took a shot at France.

President Barack Obama, Santorum said, ""actually went to France a year or so ago and was with Nicolas Sarkozy and said that, 'Here I am with the French Prime Minister, our best ally in the world.' Now think about this. Name one time in the last 20 years that the French stood by us with anything. But in Barack Obama's eyes, that makes them our best ally, because they fought what was in the best interest of our country.""

We’ll overlook the fact that Santorum misstated Sarkozy’s title -- he’s France’s president. What we were wondering about is whether Santorum is right that it’s impossible to ""name one time in the last 20 years that the French stood by us with anything."" We’ll focus on his underlying point, that France has consistently gone its own way on foreign policy rather than standing by the United States.

We emailed the Santorum campaign asking for support for the candidate's statement, but we received no response.

It’s true that France pushed for a more multilateral approach to confronting Saddam Hussein's Iraq than the George W. Bush adminstration wanted. The run-up to the Iraq war in 2002 and 2003 represented a major break in the normally amicable U.S.-French relationship, epitomized by the House of Representatives’ decision to change the name of ""french fries"" to ""freedom fries"" in its cafeteria.

But experts on United States and European diplomacy say it’s wrong to extrapolate from that one case. Overall, they agreed, Santorum’s claim is way off base.

It’s ""inaccurate and terribly misleading,"" said Richard Kuisel, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University’s BMW Center for German and European Studies and author of The French Way: How France Embraced and Rejected American Values and Power (2011) and Seducing the French: The Dilemma of Americanization (1993).

Santorum’s ""clock stopped in 2003,"" added Justin Vaïsse, senior fellow and director of research at the Center on the U.S. and Europe at the Brookings Institution.

The role of Sarkozy

A major reason for the improvement in the U.S.-French relationship has been the shift from former president Jacques Chirac to Sarkozy in 2007.

""French-American military and diplomatic relations have been excellent under Sarkozy, who is an open admirer of American culture and society,"" said Jean-Philippe Mathy, a professor of French at the University of Illinois and author of French Resistance: The French-American Culture Wars (2000).

When Sarkozy came to Washington to address a joint session of Congress in 2007, ""he found himself met by a standing ovation and occasional whoops,"" the New York Times reported. ""He at first appeared to revel in it, but as it extended to two minutes and longer, he began to appear almost embarrassed.""

""We may have differences, we may disagree on things, we may even have arguments, as in any family,"" Sarkozy said. ""But in times of difficulty, in times of hardship, one stands true to one’s friends, one stands shoulder to shoulder with them, and one helps them.""

Sarkozy’s reception was a far cry from Chirac’s, when only about 100 members of Congress attended and ""young pages were recruited to fill empty seats,"" the Times reported.

Afghanistan

The most prominent example of U.S.-French cooperation has been France’s contribution to the NATO forces in Afghanistan -- an operation instigated and heavily supported by the U.S. As of mid-January, France had 3,832 troops deployed, the fifth-largest number of any country after the U.S., the United Kingdom, Germany and Italy. About 600 French troops have been training the Afghan National Army and Afghan National Police Force, according to the Congressional Research Service. Since the start of operations, France has lost 82 servicemembers in Afghanistan.

None other than George W. Bush praised France’s commitment to the Afghanistan operation in a speech on the six-month anniversary of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. ""The power and vitality of our coalition have been proven in Afghanistan,"" Bush said. ""More than half of the forces now assisting the heroic Afghan fighters, or providing security in Kabul, are from countries other than the United States. There are many examples of commitment: our good ally, France, has deployed nearly one-fourth of its navy to support Operation Enduring Freedom.""

Côte d’Ivoire, Libya and NATO

Afghanistan is not the full extent of France’s military engagement alongside the United States. As of February 2011, France had nearly 9,000 troops in a variety of military operations across the globe, CRS wrote. In addition to Afghanistan, which is a NATO operation, France had almost 1,500 military personnel under U.N. auspices in Lebanon and at least 1,000 soldiers in Côte d’Ivoire.

""France and the U.S. have been constantly on the same line regarding Côte d’Ivoire since 2002, even when the two countries were at odds over Iraq,"" Vaïsse said. ""Last year, with the approval of Washington, France provided the troops and helicopters for the U.N. mission to oust Laurent Gbagbo and install Alassane Ouattara, the democratically elected president.""

France also cooperated with the U.S. in Libya -- in fact, France, along with the U.K., pushed the U.S. to action there in the first place.

More quietly, but significantly, Sarkozy in 2009 ended a self-imposed exile from NATO’s integrated command structure, an absence that dated back more than 40 years to French president Charles de Gaulle.

""France is currently the fourth largest contributor of troops to alliance operations and a significant financial contributor to NATO,"" CRS wrote. ""However, it had only very limited participation in the alliance’s military decision-making structures after then-President de Gaulle withdrew the country from NATO’s integrated command structure in 1966. Despite domestic opposition from critics who fear that the move could limit French military independence, the French parliament approved Sarkozy’s decision by a vote of 329-238 on March 17, 2009. U.S. officials have welcomed French reintegration as an important step toward improving alliance cohesion and strengthening the European role within NATO.""

During the past 20 years or so, France has also fought in cooperation with the United States in the Persian Gulf War in the early 1990s and in Bosnia and Kosovo in the mid-1990s.

Anti-terrorism and Iran sanctions

France has been a strong partner with the U.S. on anti-terrorism intelligence and coordination, especially under Sarkozy, a former Interior Minister. ""France has been the best ally in the war on terrorism, having had a head start on al-Qaida networks because of bombings in Paris in the 1990s that were linked with the Algerian civil war,"" Vaïsse said.

Finally, France has sought stringent sanctions against Iran for its pursuit of nuclear technology.

France has ""played a central role in pushing for three rounds of U.N. sanctions related to Iran’s nuclear program,"" CRS wrote, including ""a key role in passing the latest and most stringent U.N. sanctions against Iran to date."" Those sanctions, imposed in 2010, included a ban on new investment in Iranian oil and gas industries, a ban on insurance and re-insurance of Iranian government institutions and their affiliates; and extensive asset freezes of Iranian companies and individuals.

In fact, France has sometimes sought more stringent sanctions against Iran than some of its allies. ""On Iran sanctions, the French are actually on a tougher line than the Obama administration -- a hard line that would be closer to Republican candidates like Santorum and Romney, and Congress in general,"" Vaïsse said.

Our ruling

Santorum’s mockery of France’s willingness to advance U.S. foreign policy goals is misplaced. It’s true that the two allies broke over Iraq policy, but that’s the exception rather than the rule. On a wide range of issues over two decades -- from the Persian Gulf War to the Balkans to Afghanistan to counter-terrorism to Iran sanctions -- France has worked diplomatically with the U.S. and has repeatedly put its troops in harm’s way.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Voting Record', 'Florida', 'Connie Mack']","
Connie Mack says, ""I have a very conservative voting record.""
","
When U.S. Rep. Connie Mack entered the U.S. Senate race in Florida, he immediately became a frontrunner.

But he still has to win the Republican primary, and some conservatives have criticized Mack for not being conservative enough.

When asked about that, Mack responded, ""I am one of the most conservative members of Congress, and I have a very conservative voting record,"" according to the Republican blog the Shark Tank on Feb. 4, 2012.

In the primary, Mack will face George LeMieux, whom then-Gov. Charlie Crist appointed to serve a vacancy in the U.S. Senate in 2009, and businessman Mike McCalister. The winner will face Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.

Evaluating whether someone is the ""most’’ of anything can be tricky. We wanted to see what led Mack to make that declaration and how he fared in various rankings of the 435 members of Congress.

Mack campaign spokesman David James sent a list of organizations that had given Mack  conservative ratings in recent years. We will summarize many of the ratings that Mack’s campaign sent us, as well as some we found on our own. Mack was first elected to Congress in 2004, so we could have examined his scorecards for multiple years, but we think that looking at his grades for more recent years from multiple groups provides a good snapshot, since he didn’t specify any time frame in his claim. We’ll also look particularly at some of the votes Mack has made that depart from conservative benchmarks.

Groups that gave Mack a 100 percent rating 
Mack received his most conservative ratings from the Christian Coalition of America, Family Research Council and National Right to Life Committee. These ratings were based on 10 or fewer votes, many about abortion and other social issues.

Groups the gave Mack less than 100 percent but in the 90 percent range

• American Conservative Union (ACU): Mack got a 96 percent from the group that looks at a variety of  issues -- in 2010 that included abortion, health care, earmarks and the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul bill. He disagreed with the ACU on one of two dozen votes: he voted against lifting a moratorium on offshore drilling a few months after the BP spill.

• Club for Growth:  The club ranked Mack 52nd out of 435 with a score of 95 percent. This includes 19 House roll call votes on taxes, regulations and other issues, as well as other actions such as signing the club’s pledge to repeal the federal health care law. Mack lost points for his 2010 votes on oil drilling and supporting the national program for flood insurance.

• Americans for Prosperity: The group examines votes based on economic issues. Mack received 94 percent. Rep. Mack voted with AFP’s position on all votes in the first session of the 112th Congress, except for the Cut, Cap and Balance package that AFP supported during the debt ceiling debate last summer.  Mack said Cut, Cap and Balance still allowed for an increase in the debt ceiling, which he opposed. Mack also signed AFP’s No Climate Tax pledge.

One group gave Mack an A with no numerical rating: National Rifle Association gave Mack an A in 2010 -- a spokeswoman told us the group didn’t give a numerical grade.

Analyses from news organizations

• The Washington Post did an analysis of members of Congress in 2011 that it dubbed ""the apocalypse caucus.""  The Post noted that this group included lawmakers from both parties ""who calculate that the best way to fix government is to act as if you wouldn’t mind if it burned down."" The Post pointed to six budget votes between April and October 2011, and Mack was part of the small group that voted ""no"" every time.

• The National Journal ranks members of Congress based on key votes about economic, social and foreign policy issues and then gives them a composite score and ranking. For 2010, Mack did not make the Journal’s Top 10 most conservative. Mack was ranked the 67th most conservative and received a conservative composite score of 82.7 percent. The Journal noted that in 2010, economic issues dominated, and there were few votes on social issues or foreign issues.

Votes taken that have angered some conservatives

Mack has taken heat from some conservatives for certain votes he took since he was first elected to Congress in 2004.

The Shark Tank blog wrote in a Feb. 8 post that he drew backlash from pro-lifers after voting in favor of four embryonic stem cell bills between 2005 and 2007 -- including one to over-ride President George W. Bush’s initial veto.

""What can be more pro-life than to help people like my grandfather who suffered from illnesses that stem cell research could help,"" Mack told the Shark Tank.

Conservatives have also taken note of Mack's comments comparing Arizona’s immigration law to Nazi Germany in 2010.  
Mack was a vocal critic of the Arizona law but now tries to emphasize his opposition to amnesty and calls for tough border control. In late 2011, as he launched his candidacy, he said,  ""I thought the Arizona law went too far. And in fact the legislature in Arizona agreed and made changes. Now they didn't go far enough for me, but they recognized they were on shaky ground. I think what we need to do is be tough on border security, that we need to have the E-Verify as a national system, that we need to be tough on illegal immigrants but at the same time not destroy the freedoms of some Americans that may look different than you and me.""

Mack’s Republican opponents have also attacked him for voting for billions of dollars in earmarks -- though members of both parties have pursued earmarks. The Miami Herald reported that many of those earmarks were for defense or popular with constituents such as a local university. But he also voted for projects outside of Florida including an aquarium in Connecticut and a city pool near the California district of his wife, Republican U.S. Rep. Mary Bono Mack.

Mack said ""I have a very conservative voting record."" The general way Mack worded his claim makes it easy for him: There are times when he didn’t take a hard-line conservative position, such as his stances on stem cell research and the Arizona immigration law. But Mack’s claim here was about his overall record and how he compared to the rest of Congress, and for that he has gotten high marks from several conservative organizations.

U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore says Donald Trump 'thinks stop-and-frisk is fine'
","In a post-election interview that focused on incarceration and policing, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore was asked about Republican President-elect Donald Trump. And she made a claim about him and the controversial police practice called ""stop-and-frisk"" -- the practice of a police officer stopping and questioning a person, then patting the person down for weapons. Here was part of the exchange the Huffington Post had with the Milwaukee Democrat, according to an article posted Nov. 18, 2016: Question: Policing plays a huge role in our mass incarceration problem. Do you think policing could change at all under Trump?  

Moore: He’s shared a lot of stuff with us. He thinks stop-and-frisk is fine! (Former New York Mayor) Rudy Giuliani thinks it’s fine. And I don’t know where they’ll land in his administration. According to him, a lot of things he said and did were just Hollywood and bluster and now he’s going to be presidential.

If stop-and-frisk was just part of the dog whistle he knew he needed to put out there to get all of the angry white men to come out of the rural areas to vote for him ― we don’t (know) if that was just something he said to get elected. So a lot of us are trying to be hopeful. So, where does Trump stand on stop-and-frisk? Trump statements As the campaign with Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee, entered its final weeks, Trump made headlines with comments about stop-and-frisk. On Sept. 21, 2016, at a Fox News-televised town hall at a church in Cleveland Heights, Ohio, Trump called for wider use of stop-and-frisk to combat violent crime. An audience member had asked Trump how he would stop crime in the black community. Trump responded that stop-and-frisk would be one of the things he would do, adding: I think you have to [do it]. We did it in New York, it worked incredibly well and you have to be proactive ….In New York City, it was so incredible the way it worked. Five days later, at the first presidential debate, moderator Lester Holt asked Trump what he would do to heal racial divides. Trump said: We have to bring back law and order. Now, whether or not in a place like Chicago you do stop and frisk, which worked very well, Mayor Giuliani is here, worked very well in New York. It brought the crime rate way down. But you take the gun away from criminals that shouldn’t be having it …. Moments later, Holt said: ""The argument is that it’s a form of racial profiling"" and Trump replied: No, the argument is that we have to take the guns away from these people that have them and they are bad people that shouldn’t have them. These are felons. These are people that are bad people that shouldn’t be — when you have 3,000 shootings in Chicago from January 1st, when you have 4,000 people killed in Chicago by guns, from the beginning of the presidency of Barack Obama, his hometown, you have to have stop-and-frisk. And later in the debate, Trump’s praise was more effusive when he said: In New York City, stop-and-frisk, we had 2,200 murders, and stop-and-frisk brought it down to 500 murders …. Stop-and-frisk had a tremendous impact on the safety of New York City. Tremendous beyond belief. So when you say it has no impact, it really did. It had a very, very big impact. Two parentheticals on Trump in the debate: He claimed stop-and-frisk was not ruled unconstitutional in New York. PolitiFact National rated the statement Mostly False. On his claim that stop-and-frisk ""brought the crime way down"" in New York City, the Washington Post Fact Checker observed: ""Crime is affected by many factors, and New York’s decline in crime mirrored the decline in many other major cities at the time. Moreover, crime was declining for four years before Giuliani took office, and it continued to decline for 14 years after he left."" It’s also worth noting that Trump’s support for stop-and-frisk goes back to at least 2013, when he said on Twitter: Stop and frisk works. Instead of criticizing @NY_POLICE Chief Ray Kelly, New Yorkers should be thanking him for keeping NY safe. And: If Stop & Frisk is struck down by the pandering NYC politicians, increases in crime & eventual terrorist attacks will be on them. We didn’t get a response when we asked Trump’s campaign about Moore’s claim. But we couldn’t find any statements indicating Trump has changed his position. Our rating Moore said Trump ""thinks stop-and-frisk is fine."" During the 2016 presidential campaign, less than two months before the election, Trump made a series of statements praising stop-and-frisk, repeating his claim that it reduces crime and saying the controversial police tactic should be used more broadly around the country. We rate Moore’s statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/64fec69f-1f42-4623-a92a-ffab83b2c253",/factchecks/2016/dec/09/gwen-moore/us-rep-gwen-moore-d-milwaukee-says-donald-trump-th/

Sheri Gallo says Alison Alter 'exploited' loophole to land $64,000 for campaign
","Seeking re-election, Austin City Council Member Sheri Gallo says in a mailer to voters in West Austin’s District 10 that challenger Alison Alter ""exploited a campaign loophole to obtain over $64,000 in public dollars to fund her campaign."" Alter, a philanthropic adviser making her first bid for office, received $64,171.19 in public financing toward her runoff campaign after placing second in November’s general election. She received the money as a reward for agreeing to comply with the city’s voluntary campaign spending limits, including not spending more than $75,000 during the general election. So, did Alter, who faces Gallo on the Dec. 13 ballot, draw that money fair and square? Alter’s campaign finance reports filed before the general election indicated that she did, and the city clerk cut the check. But an additional Alter campaign finance filing posted Dec. 5, 2016 — after Gallo's mailer went out — show that Alter exceeded the limit. Either way, Gallo told us by email, a ""loophole"" in the city's rules allowed Alter to get the public aid without having to meet those campaign finance limits because Gallo didn’t commit to the limits. ""Ms. Alter,"" Gallo wrote, ""agreed to abide by the restrictions, knowing full well that she would not have to follow those restrictions."" Let’s look at the roots of Austin’s campaign finance ordinances and then into how Alter drew the money. Voluntary limits adopted in 1994 The city’s public campaign finance system, the Austin Fair Campaign Ordinance, won council approval in October 1994. At the time, advocates said limits on donation amounts and voluntary spending restrictions — which could lead to freshets of money for compliant candidates who made into runoffs — would enable more people to run. Council members voted to raise money for the runoff pool, the Austin Fair Campaign Finance Fund, from lobbyist registration fees. Under the system, mayoral candidates volunteer to spend no more than $120,000 in a general election or more than $80,000 in a runoff; for City Council candidates, the limits are $75,000 in the general election and $50,000 in a runoff. The ordinance also imposes specific limits on personal loans by candidates and contributions from political action committees and donors who live outside the city. In exchange, the pot of public funding — paid for by those lobby fees, fines for campaign finance violations and donations — is to be divvied up among the candidates who agree to comply and also advance to a runoff. If no candidates agree to the program, or if none who did make it to a runoff, the accumulated money rolls over, like unused minutes on a cell phone plan. The 2016 elections Before the 2016 elections, three council candidates agreed to ‘Fair Campaign’ restrictions: District 2 candidate Wesley Faulkner, who lost to incumbent Delia Garza; District 7 incumbent Leslie Pool, who won outright; and Alter. As the sole candidate in a runoff who signed the pledge, Alter drew all $64,000 in available aid. Alter’s campaign spending So, did Alter adhere to the program’s requirements or did she find a way around them? On Nov. 22, 2016, Alter’s campaign got the $64,000 check at issue after the City Clerk’s office determined it complied with the finance limits. Under the ordinance, the clerk reviews the most recent campaign finance reports available. In this instance, those reports covered donations and expenditures up to 10 days before the general election. And through that time, Alter reported raising $10,886 from donors outside of the city, less than the $36,000 cap; garnering $900 from non-individuals, under the $24,000 cap on donations from political action committees; and she’d reported spending $61,556.74, which was short of the $75,000 spending cap for the general election. Also, Alter had ponied up $563.67 in personal funds, less than the $3,750 cap. A full accounting of Alter’s pre-election spending would not be possible until the campaign finance reports for the runoff were filed. That Alter campaign filing--submitted Dec. 5, 2016, after the check was cut and Gallo’s fliers began hitting mailboxes--showed that Alter spent $80,000 in the general election, exceeding the $75,000 voluntary spending cap by nearly 7 percent. A city official We wondered what recourse the city had if such a situation arose. By phone to our inquiry, a city spokesman, Bryce Bencivengo, said the clerk’s office checks that later finance report and could find Alter’s campaign in violation. But, Bencivengo said, the ordinance contains no language directing the city what to do next. However, Bencivengo advised, the rules allowed Alter to remain eligible for the runoff money, even if she exceeded the spending limit, if her opponent didn’t participate in the public financing system. Per the city code, because Gallo did not commit to the voluntary limits, Alter could draw the runoff funds whether she abided or not. Previous candidates who signed pledge Gallo’s mention of Alter exploiting a loophole reminded us that in spring 2011, Place 3 Council Member Randi Shade made a similar claim about challenger Kathie Tovo, who landed $64,129 from the city for their runoff despite failing to comply with the voluntary city spending limits. Shade suggested Tovo never intended to abide by the spending limits because she loaned her campaign $53,000 -- much more than the $3,750 limit on personal loans -- after signing the pledge. Tovo, who won that runoff, responded she'd followed the spirit and letter of the law, and didn't know when she signed the pledge how much runoff money was in the fund. ""The intent of the (program) is to level the playing field among candidates, especially if -- like me -- you're running against a well-funded incumbent,"" Tovo said. In 2014, much the same situation replayed when then-District 7 candidate Leslie Pool signed the pledge, but then loaned her campaign nearly 10 times the allowed amount. Like Tovo in 2011 and Alter in 2016, Pool could legally exceed the limit because other candidates didn’t pledge to heed it. Our ruling Gallo said Alter ""has exploited a campaign finance loophole to obtain over $64,000 in public dollars to fund her campaign."" Gallo couldn’t have known when she sent her mailers that Alter ultimately exceeded the spending limit she’d pledged to meet. But under city rules, Alter qualified for the runoff money anyway, as Gallo noted, because Gallo hadn’t committed to the same finance restrictions. Was that a loophole? We find that reasonably debatable. We rate Gallo’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Conservative website says Obama program for Central American minors mostly helps adults
","A conservative news outlet criticized a federal program created to bring United States children fleeing violence in Central America into the United States, saying it largely benefits adults. ""Recent government data shows that more than two-thirds of the aliens the Obama administration has brought to the United States under the president's Central American Minors program weren’t actually minors at all,"" said the Dec. 1 post published by MRCTV. Only 30 percent of individuals who have come to the United States under the program are under 18 years old, the article said. ""Conversely, a full 70 percent of those aliens who’ve been allowed into the United States under the president’s program for ‘minors’ are adults,"" said MRCTV. A PolitiFact reader asked us to look into it. We found that while MRCTV’s data for arrivals under 18 is largely accurate, its interpretation of who should count as a minor differs from the government definition. The public relations firm representing MRCTV, which says its goal is to ""break down the boundaries between traditional conservative media and mainstream culture,"" did not respond to requests for information. Violence and poverty Gang violence and poverty in Central American nations has propelled thousands of children to leave their homes unaccompanied and cross illegally into the United States. The number of Central American children coming alone started to increase in fiscal year 2012, largely due to an influx from Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras. It rose significantly in fiscal year 2014, according to data from U.S. Customs and Border Protection. The number of unaccompanied children (0 to 17 years old) from El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras apprehended at the southwest border reached a high in fiscal year 2014 at 51,705, up from 10,146 in fiscal year 2012, per border patrol data. Apprehensions of unaccompanied children from those three Central American countries dropped in fiscal year 2015 but picked up again in fiscal year 2016. The White House in June 2014 announced a series of new programs and partnerships with Central American countries to address economic and criminal problems that motivated youth to migrate to the United States. Central American Minors program President Barack Obama’s administration in November 2014 also announced a refugee/parole program ""to provide a safe, legal, and orderly alternative to the dangerous journey that some children are currently undertaking to the United States."" The Central American Minors program allows certain parents with lawful presence in the United States to petition for their children in Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras to come in as refugees. Children ineligible for admission as refugees but at risk of harm may be admitted under parole. A ""qualifying child"" must be unmarried, under 21 and living in Guatemala, El Salvador or Honduras, according to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. The immigration agency says that in certain cases, a parent who lives with a qualifying child may also apply for the program if he or she is the legal spouse of the person in the United States requesting the child’s resettlement. The program was expanded in 2016 to allow additional family members to apply. A State Department spokesperson said given the time it takes to vet applicants, no one who would be eligible under the expansion has been admitted yet. More than 10,500 people have applied for the Central American Minors program and 1,644 have been admitted as of Dec. 1, according to the State Department. Here’s a breakdown of the 1,644 arrivals: ""Minors"" admissions comprise 83 percent: - 484 (29 percent) under 18 years old - 1,106 (67 percent) under 21 years old - 1,370 (83 percent) under 22 years old ""The reason that some arrivals are 21 (not under 21, as the program specifies) is that a qualifying child must be ‘under 21’ at the time the application is received, but can arrive as a 21-year-old, since the adjudication process takes approximately one year on average,"" a State Department spokesperson said. The remaining 17 percent of arrivals are the legal/biological parents of the qualifying child, according to the State Department. MRCTV’s post that more than two-thirds of arrivals under the programs aren’t minors is technically accurate when accounting for minors as applicants under 18. Generally in the United States, 18 is considered the ""age of majority"" and the age when individuals are no longer considered minors. (Eighteen is the minimum age to vote, but Americans must be 21 to legally buy alcohol.) But immigration law has a different rule: ""A ‘child’ is defined as an individual who is unmarried and under the age of 21,"" according to USCIS. The reason? People who may have been targeted for persecution when they were under 18 could still be at risk when they cross that threshold, said Peter Margulies, who teaches immigration law and national security law at Roger Williams University School of Law. ""Gangs still want more members,"" Margulies said. ""If gangs don't care if their target is 17 or 20, the United States should extend protection in both cases. Otherwise, the individual remains in danger of persecution."" ""Gangs do not stop their abuse on a victim’s 18th birthday,"" added Michael Kagan, a law professor and director of the immigration clinic at University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Our ruling An article by MRCTV said, ""More than two-thirds of the aliens the Obama administration has brought to the United States under the president's Central American Minors program weren’t actually minors at all."" Per State Department data, 83 percent (1,370) of 1,644 individuals who have come to the United States through the program have been under 22 years old and qualifying minors, including 484 people (29 percent) under 18 years old. Though 18 is generally considered the age of adulthood, for immigration purposes, an unmarried person under 21 is considered a ""child,"" meeting the qualifying age for the minors program. Some individuals who were 21 were admitted because they were under the age at the time of their application. MRCTV’s statement is accurate but needs additional clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/dec/07/blog-posting/claim-central-american-minors-program-mostly-benef/

No, Trump's health secretary pick Tom Price doesn't want to 'phase out' Medicare
","Donald Trump’s pick for Health and Human Services secretary, Rep. Tom Price, R-Ga., has a plan to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. But a Democratic website says he wants to go further and nix Medicare, the federal health insurance program for seniors and the disabled.   ""Trump’s Health Secretary Pick Wants a Medicare Phase Out by Summer 2017,"" reads a headline on a Winning Democrats article posted Dec. 1. Over the next week the post generated 14,000 likes. The Winning Democrats article frames Price’s position as ending Medicare. ""In short, Americans can expect Republicans in Congress to begin their effort to wipe out Medicare in one swoop, which would harm millions of Americans immediately and millions more in the years to come as Medicare no longer exists to help older Americans pay for health care without having to deal with all the bulls--- private insurance companies do,"" reads an excerpt from the piece. Democratic claims that Republicans wanted to end Medicare were pervasive in previous years, so much so that the claim ""Republicans voted to end Medicare"" won the 2011 Lie of the Year. Price’s alleged position is significant since Trump promised to leave Medicare alone as president. More recently, however, Trump’s transition website says he wants to ""modernize Medicare so that it will be ready for the challenges with the coming retirement of the Baby Boom generation -- and beyond."" Does Trump’s HHS pick actually want to discontinue Medicare? We found that Price does favor changing Medicare, but it’s wrong to say he wants to end it. Price’s plan does not equal phasing out Medicare Price’s spokesperson sent PolitiFact the Fiscal Year 2017 Budget Resolution as a basis for Price’s plan. The resolution was prepared by the House budget committee, of which Price is chairman. The plans does not include ending Medicare. The suggested plan would be similar to the Medicare Advantage program. Beneficiaries would pick from a list of government-approved plans and the government would make a payment to the insurers to help cover the cost of the plan. Paul Ginsburg, a public policy professor at the University of Southern California, called the ""phase out"" claim false. ""The FY17 budget resolution says some things about Medicare, but they appear to be along the lines of more private-plan alternatives to traditional Medicare,"" Ginsburg said. ""However, it is not at all clear how these would differ from Medicare Advantage plans, which have attracted more than 30 percent of Medicare beneficiaries."" Ginsburg wasn’t alone. None of the experts we interviewed said Price’s plan amounts to getting rid of Medicare. Experts did agree, however, that Price’s plan would dramatically change how Medicare works. ""I do not equate Price’s plan to ‘phasing out Medicare,’ though the plan would significantly change how Medicare works, converting it from a defined benefit program (beneficiaries guaranteed a certain level of coverage) into a defined contribution program (beneficiaries given a fixed dollar amount with which to buy coverage),"" said Michael Spearer, a health policy and management professor at Columbia University. That’s a serious change, but the Winning Democrats story makes it sound as if Price is referring to phasing out Medicare. Here’s how the remark appears in the story:  That quote originally appeared in a Nov. 17 Talking Points Memo article, ""Rep. Tom Price Reveals Republicans Eyeing Medicare Overhaul In 2017."" So the Winning Democrats frames Price’s quote to refer to phasing out Medicare, when the remark was in reference to a Medicare overhaul. Our ruling Winning Democrats said Price wants to phase out Medicare by summer 2017. Price favors an overhaul of Medicare, but the phrase ""phase out"" is too strong and gives readers the specific impression Medicare won’t exist under Price. Medicare will exist, and Price’s preferred plan for its future is laid out in detail in the 2017 Fiscal Year Budget Resolution. In addition, the article offers little to no evidence to support the idea that Price wants to end Medicare.

Sid Miller posts manipulated photo of 'The Rock' wearing a pro-flag T-shirt
","Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner perhaps destined to join President-elect Donald Trump’s administration, has a prolific social media presence. The politician regularly posts memes, photos and his reactions to daily news, at times critical of reporting and often without attribution. His ""Miller for Texas"" Facebook fan page has more than 330,000 likes. On Nov. 27, 2016, Miller posted a fresh unattributed photo, this time of the muscled actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, shown wearing a T-shirt with a message Miller endorsed. Johnson’s shirt read: ""We stand for the flag, we kneel for the fallen,"" along with this Miller caption: ""Thanks to Dewayne Johnson AKA ""The Rock"" for standing up and defending our flag. There are a few good guys left in Hollywood and The Rock is one of them."" As of early December 2016, Miller’s Johnson post had drawn 3,500 reactions, 1,092 shares and 111 comments, all supportive, some praising Johnson for being a ""stand up guy"" who’s ""not ashamed to admit"" his love for country, or telling Johnson ""he is The Rock for a reason."" Is photo real? But when we saw the photo presentation, it looked to us like the unsourced photo’s shirt text had alignment problems. Also, the text on the T-shirt looked skewed and a smudge next to Johnson’s right arm looked as if there might have been additional removed text or imagery. We knew too that Miller had previously posted a photo lacking accuracy. In March 2016, we found ""Pants on Fire""  what turned out to be Miller’s Facebook post of a fake image of Barack Obama holding a T-shirt with Marxist revolutionary Che Guevara’s face on it. Separately, the Texas Tribune in December 2016 compiled what its story described as 10 Miller posts of ""demonstrably false, misleading or unsupported information."" A reverse image search We started our review of the Johnson photo posted by Miller by conducting a reverse Google image search of it. Such a search enables anyone to pull up similar images across the web, demonstrating if other versions have been posted in digital spaces. If multiple versions of a photo exist online, a reverse Google image search can show some of the different iterations. What came back from our search: The same T-shirt and Johnson pose with other slogans displayed, such as ""Only elephants should wear ivory"" or ""Still here, still strong, Native Pride.""  Additional results showed Johnson standing in a blank V-neck T-shirt, without any text. And among those, one photo came from the cover of the August 2013 issue of Essence Magazine; that photo shows Johnson wearing a similarly fitting navy blue V-neck T-shirt, without any text on the shirt. Then again, Johnson holds a different pose and presents a different facial expression. Other results--on websites such as Pinterest and Mid-day.com, an Indian news and lifestyle website--showed what looked to us like a blank T-shirt version of the Miller-posted photo.  Miller spokesman calls inquiry 'silly' So, what gives? We turned to a Miller campaign spokesman, Todd Smith, to find out where Miller picked up his Facebook-posted photo. Smith said he personally ""had no clue"" and said ours was a ""silly, silly inquiry."" He said the message of the T-shirt is what counts. When asked what his comment would be if the photo itself was fake, he said he hadn’t heard complaints from Johnson. Johnson representative says Miller photo 'photoshopped' Next, we endeavored to reach someone familiar with Johnson’s photo history. After calling Johnson’s public relations team, we heard from Britt Johnson with the Garcia Companies, who identifies herself as a social media spokesperson for Johnson. Britt Johnson said by email: ""While I can't recall where that photo was taken, I can say with confidence that the image/shirt"" shared by Miller ""was photoshopped."" Forensic photography expert Separately, a web search led us to a forensic photography expert at the Forensic and National Security Sciences Institute at Syracuse University. By email,  Cathryn Lahm responded that what she looked at after downloading a copy of the photo we’d shared from Miller’s Facebook post and viewing the photo in her software program, ""the T-shirt The Rock is wearing is most likely ‘plain’ and the graphics were placed on the photo -- made to look -- like it was actually on his shirt,"" referring to the pro-flag message. She said the artist likely applied the graphic design onto an existing image, so Johnson would look like he was wearing the presented T-shirt. ""The original image was shot at some press event -- I think -- based on the ‘hot flash shadows’ as if he is walking the red carpet for some opening of a movie or an event,"" Lahm said. If she ""had to go to court"" about the authenticity of the Miller-posted photo, Lahm said, she would call the image a fake. Our ruling Miller posted a photo of ""The Rock"" wearing a T-shirt with a message calling for people to ""stand for the flag and kneel for the fallen."" That image, we found, was a product of photo manipulation. It looks to us like Johnson actually posed in a plain shirt without any message. We rate this photo post False.

Were 300,000 Wisconsin voters turned away from the polls in the 2016 presidential election?
","It’s widely expected that after a recount of 3 million ballots under way in Wisconsin, Donald Trump will still have won the state. But what if 300,000 more Wisconsinites had voted in the presidential election? That number is 11 times higher than Trump’s 22,000-vote margin over Hillary Clinton, based on the original counts. The specter of a different result was raised widely on Twitter beginning Nov. 9, 2016, the day after the election. It came with this claim (which used a vote-margin figure that had been quoted in some news reports): Trump won Wisconsin by 27,000 votes. 300,000 voters were turned away by the state’s strict Voter ID law. There is your ""rigged"" election. By Dec. 6, 2016 -- midway through the $3.5 million recount, paid for by the campaign of Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein -- the tweet was still being retweeted. (Stein, by the way, earned a Pants on Fire for her claim that Wisconsin uses outlawed voting machines.) There’s no evidence that 300,000 Wisconsin voters were turned away from the polling places because they didn’t have photo identification. But it’s worth noting, with the emergence of fake news, that the figure isn’t pulled out of thin air. The law, and lawsuits In 2011, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Legislature adopted and GOP Gov. Scott Walker signed a law requiring residents to show a photo identification in order to vote. A drivers license, state ID card, passport and other forms of ID were among those that would meet the law. Voters could request a free state ID for voting from the state Department of Motor Vehicles. (Wisconsin is one of seven states with a so-called strict photo ID law, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Eight other states have a photo ID law that’s labeled as non-strict.) The same year, and again in 2012, various groups filed lawsuits. After a two-week trial, U.S. District Judge Lynn Adelman in 2014 struck down the law. The Milwaukee judge said the requirement that voters show photo IDs at the polls established an unconstitutional burden on the right to vote and violated the federal Voting Rights Act because its effects hit Latinos and African-Americans harder than whites. As part of his ruling, Adelman determined that about 300,000 registered voters in Wisconsin -- about 9 percent of all registered voters -- lacked the type of identification needed for voting. He said his finding was based primarily on expert testimony from Leland Beatty, a statistical marketing consultant in Texas who was hired by the plaintiffs. Beatty, the judge wrote, estimated the number of registered voters who did not have a drivers license or state ID card. After more litigation, the law was eventually reinstated in 2015. 2016 election So, how many people were turned away in the 2016 presidential election for lack of photo ID? In Wisconsin, according to the state Elections Commission, there were 2,975,313 votes cast for president in 2016 (prior to the recount), down 93,121 votes or 3 percent from 2012. The Milwaukee election director said the drop of 41,000 included ""some of the greatest declines"" in areas ""we projected would have the most trouble with voter ID requirements."" He also acknowledged, however, that some of the drop-off had to do with the candidates and less enthusiasm for the candidates. But no statistics are kept on the number of people who were turned away at polling locations on election day for lack of photo ID. In any case, it’s almost certain the figure is not 300,000. Adelman himself noted that although he found the voter ID law would ""deter or prevent a substantial number"" of the 300,000 from voting, ""a more precise measurement is impracticable. There is no way to determine exactly how many people (the law) will prevent or deter from voting without considering the individual circumstances of each of the 300,000 plus citizens who lack an ID."" Political scientist Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told us: ""There is no evidence that 300,000 people were turned away in the November 2016 election. We will never know the precise impact of the voter ID law on turnout. It is almost certainly not true that all 300,000 or so people who are registered but lack ID tried to vote this year."" Simply put, while it’s likely that some voters were turned away at the polls, others no doubt obtained a photo ID and cast their ballots. Snopes.com, which in its fact check of this statement issued a rating of ""unproven,"" concluded that ""even if the 300,000 figure was an accurate estimate of Wisconsin residents who back in 2014 possibly could not vote because they did not have the correct identification, that number was not a head count of residents who actually did or would have set out to vote on Nov. 8, 2016, only to be turned away."" After that fact check, the originator of the tweet wrote a blog post acknowledging there isn’t evidence to back up the claim. Our rating Tens of thousands of times, Twitter users repeated this statement: In Wisconsin, ""300,000 voters were turned away by the state’s strict voter ID law"" in the 2016 presidential election. A federal judge in 2014 determined in a civil rights lawsuit that some 300,000 registered voters in Wisconsin lack the photo identification necessary to comply with Wisconsin’s voter ID law. But there is no evidence that anywhere near that number of people were turned away from the polls in the 2016 presidential election for lack of a proper photo ID.

Fact-checking Donald Trump's tweet on Air Force One, Boeing
","President-elect Donald Trump tweeted criticism about Boeing, the lead contractor on the next generation of Air Force Ones, early in the morning on Dec. 6, 2016. Trump tweeted, ""Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!"" Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order! He later elaborated to reporters staking out Trump Tower, ""Well the plane is totally out of control. It's going to be over $4 billion for Air Force One program. I think it's ridiculous, I think Boeing is doing a little bit of a number. We want Boeing to make a lot of money, but not that much money."" The political and defense worlds and the stock market immediately took note, since Boeing is a major American corporation that gets a lot of Pentagon money and employs significant numbers of manufacturing workers in high-wage jobs. When we looked into Trump’s tweet, we found that Trump’s description of the contract lacks some context. (His press office did not respond to an inquiry.) Some background on the Air Force One replacement project As the trade publication Defense One has noted, the two current Air Force Ones -- a modified version of a Boeing 747-200 aircraft known as VC-25 -- were purchased under President Ronald Reagan and were delivered in 1990 under President George H.W. Bush. With Boeing closing down its 747-200 production line 24 years ago, spare parts for the two current planes have become hard to find. And the plane is approaching the end of its expected 30-year life. So during his second term, President Barack Obama ordered a replacement fleet. (By tradition, a president does not order planes that he will expect to use personally.) Since the old model of the basic aircraft isn’t being made any longer, a new one had to be created. The new model will be based on the Boeing 747-8, with four engines and two floors. Trump’s tweet referenced one plane, but the Air Force One program will actually produce two planes, not one. That allows one to undergo maintenance while the other one is available. Of course, Air Force One is more than just a plane. It’s also a mobile command center, with state-of-the-art communications and safety features. The plane must be able to refuel while flying, and the president and his staff need to have communications capabilities equivalent to what is in the Oval Office -- secure video conferences, classified computer access, and nuclear-strike controls. It also needs robust defensive systems such as missile evasion. The new planes will be ""both the fastest and longest commercial airliner in the world,"" according to military.com. They will be able to fly 7,730 nautical miles -- nearly 1,000 more than the current planes -- and will produce 16 tons less of carbon dioxide on a typical flight, according to the company. The extra features, obviously, do not come cheap. In fact, they comprise the bulk of the planes’ cost. Each basic plane costs about $380 million, said Richard Aboulafia, vice president for analysis at the Teal Group Corporation, an aerospace and defense market analysis firm. Ultimately, Aboulafia said, the basic aircraft itself will account for just one-fifth of the entire project cost. How much will the project cost? The Air Force has published a budgetary document that says research, development, testing and evaluation of the new Air Force Ones -- officially known as the Presidential Aircraft Recapitalization -- will cost $2.87 billion between fiscal years 2015 and 2021. However, the project is expected to extend beyond 2021, and experts told PolitiFact it would likely require another $1 billion in subsequent years to finish the job. The Teal Group has estimated that the project will require an additional $858 million between fiscal years 2022 and 2026. That adds up to a grand total of $3.73 billion over 12 years. That’s not ""more than $4 billion,"" as Trump said, but it’s reasonably close -- and it’s no secret that defense contracts have a history of escalating in cost over time. Already, in response to inquiries from the media after Trump’s tweet, an Air Force spokesman told reporters to expect the interim $2.7 billion figure ""to change as the program matures."" So as a raw number, Trump’s $4 billion figure is in the ballpark. We should add that none of this price-tag includes operations and maintenance, such as aviation fuel, maintenance and pilot salaries. ""Operations and maintenance are an inherent part of any such program,"" said John Pike, director of globalsecurity.org. ""Canada was in line to buy the F-35, but then realized that they would actually had to operate the things, and they had sticker shock. Malaysia bought a bunch of MiG-29s without a service contract, to save money, and they soon turned into hangar queens."" Such future costs would not involve Boeing, which is tasked with designing and building the planes, not operating them. What the tweet leaves out Clearly, $4 billion is a lot of money. But it’s important to keep some context in mind. First, it’s not clear that Boeing is behind any spiraling of costs; the demands of the project are dictated by the federal government. In addition, while Boeing is serving as the lead contractor on the project, much of the project’s costs are going for electronics and other items that Boeing itself does not produce. If costs on such items are going to go down, Boeing can’t do that directly. To cut such costs, ""it is up to Boeing to jawbone their subcontractors,"" Pike said. Boeing offered some spin of its own in the statement it released after Trump’s tweet. In the statement, Boeing said: ""We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serves the unique requirements of the president of the United States. We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the program allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer."" By citing only the $170 million allocated to date, the company is ignoring the overwhelming majority of dollars for the project that the company expects to be paid in future years. Second, it’s important to note that the nearly $4 billion figure for the project as a whole is scheduled to be paid out over 12 years, not all at once. And in the context of the entire defense budget, that makes it a pretty small slice. The most recent presidential budget proposal shows defense spending between 2015 and 2026 equaling $8.132 trillion. So the Air Force One project amounts to four-one-hundredths of 1 percent of all defense spending over that 12-year time frame. It’s also a modest project within Boeing’s ledger of business. In 2015, Boeing had $96 billion in revenues. If one assumes the same revenues for all 12 years of the Air Force One project, then the project will account for three-tenths of 1 percent of the company’s overall revenues. Even looking just at the company’s defense, space and security revenues, the Air Force One project would represent about 1 percent. Finally, Trump’s contention that spending is ""out of control"" is more open to debate. While the program is expensive, it’s so new that it hasn’t busted through budgetary targets yet. ""There have been no overruns,"" Aboulafia said. ""This has always been the plan."" Our ruling Trump tweeted, ""Boeing is building a brand new 747 Air Force One for future presidents, but costs are out of control, more than $4 billion. Cancel order!"" The company is actually building two planes, not one. As for the price tag, Trump has more of a point. The project’s current cost is $3.73 billion, which is within shouting distance of Trump’s ""more than $4 billion."" That’s a projection over 12 years. Also, that figure is an amount that could rise as time goes on. However, Trump glosses over some important context. National-security requirements, not Boeing, have been the primary driver of high costs. Experts say the costs are broadly in line considering the high-tech and security requirements of a presidential plane. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2016/dec/06/donald-trump/fact-checking-donald-trumps-tweet-air-force-one-bo/

Annie's List: Men hold 80 percent of 'lawmaking power' in Texas Legislature
","Annie’s List, a group that tries to elect progressive, pro-choice women in Texas, sees a lacking in your Texas Legislature: ""Although Texas is one of America’s largest and most diverse states, and even though men comprise 49% of the population, they hold 80% of the lawmaking power in the Legislature (144 of 181 seats)."" Note: When all seats are filled, the state Legislature has 181 members, including 31 senators and 150 Texas House members. Edith Wilmans of Dallas, elected to the House in 1922 before losing re-election two years later, was the state’s first female legislator. In 1926, Margie Neal of Carthage proved the first woman elected to the Texas Senate, where she served until 1933. But women did not hold more than a few legislative seats until the 1980s. The Legislative Reference Library’s listing of women members shows that the 70th regular session, in 1987, included 21 female House members and four women in the Senate. From then, the number of female House members escalated -- reaching a record 38 members in 2009 and dipping after that -- while the number of female senators stayed in the low single digits until the 2007 session began with five female senators; that body has had a record eight females since 2015. So, is male dominance just as Annie’s List declared in a November 2016 press release? Let’s first consider the group’s contention about the minority status of men in the state’s population. We turned to the Texas Demographic Center at the University of Texas at San Antonio, which says in its latest available estimate that the state’s total 2014 population of 26.9 million people broke out to 13.4 million men (48 percent) and 13.5 million women (51 percent).These estimates, which are posted on the center’s website, are the product of baseline projections from the 2010 Census population of each county. Second, we checked the Legislature’s makeup. Given the somewhat fluid nature of its membership -- some lawmakers retire, others are defeated -- we looked first at its composition on Jan. 13, 2015, the first day of the 2015 regular session. Membership by Gender of 84th Legislature, Jan. 13, 2015 Gender House Senate Total Male 120 23 143 Female 28 8 36 Total 148* 31 179 SOURCE: Membership Statistics for the 84th Legislature, Legislative Reference Library, undated (accessed Dec. 2, 2016) *Two House seats were vacant at the time: HD 13 (Brenham) and HD 123 (San Antonio) The 2015 counts bear out the Annie's List contention: About 80 percent of Texas lawmakers were men, 20 percent were women. The mix is narrowly poised to change in early 2017 due to the results of the 2016 elections, with the House netting one additional woman and the Senate continuing with eight women, according to a library list of members-elect posted online after the November 2016 elections. The 2017 Legislature, whose members will be sworn in on Jan. 10, 2017, the first day of the 140-day regular session, will include 23 first-time members, the list shows. Men account for 65 percent of the first-termers, women about 35 percent: Expected Membership by Gender of Newly Elected Texas Legislators, Jan. 10, 2017 Gender House Senate Total Male 15 0 15 Female 7 1 8 Total 22 1 23 SOURCE: Members-elect for the 85th Legislature, Legislative Reference Library, undated, (accessed Dec. 2, 2016) Merging the new members and the returning ones gave us the final gender breakdown for the 85th Texas Legislature. In total, about 80 percent will be men and 20 percent will be women -- no change from the previous session. Members by Gender of the 85th Legislature, Jan. 10, 2017 Gender House Senate Total Male 121 23 144 Female 29 8 37 Total 150 31 181 SOURCE: Members-elect for the 85th Legislature, Legislative Reference Library, undated (accessed Dec. 2, 2016) Our ruling Annie’s List said that ""though men comprise 49% of the population, they hold 80% of the lawmaking power in the Legislature (144 of 181 seats)."" In 2014, 51 percent of the state’s residents were female, 48 percent were male. Of late, men account for 80 percent of Texas legislators, women comprise 20 percent. After members are sworn in for the 2017 regular session, there also will be an 80-20 split. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Mostly False: Roger Williams' claim that a lot of trucks not inspected crossing U.S.-Mexico border
","A Texas congressman aware that President-elect Donald Trump has vowed to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement says that right now, many potentially dangerous trucks roll uninspected from Mexico into the U.S. Roger Williams, a Republican car dealer, called himself a ""free trade guy"" in an interview with Alex Daugherty of the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. The resulting November 2016 McClatchy news story also quoted Williams saying: ""NAFTA allows a lot of trucks from Mexico. ... They can drive through without even being inspected. That concerns me."" We wondered if Williams, whose district runs from Austin north and west nearly into Tarrant County, was right about uninspected trucks. To be sure, the 1994 trade agreement committed the bordering nations to allowing each other’s trucks to carry goods across the border and make deliveries anywhere inside their respective countries. But implementation proved bumpy, we learned, and few trucks from Mexico lately trundle outside of border commercial zones. Also, trucks from Mexico might not be safety threats in themselves. A federal pilot project -- involving over 900 long-haul trucks traveling from Mexico over three years ending in fall 2014 -- showed ""Mexico-domiciled motor carriers operating beyond the commercial zones"" on the border ""had safety records that were equal to or better than the national average for U.S. and Canadian motor carriers operating in the United States,"" the Department of Transportation told Congress in 2015. Still, are a lot of trucks rumbling across the border uninspected? We sent emails inquiring into Williams’ factual backup and asking Customs and Border Protection, the agency most associated with border security, to assess his claim. A Williams’ spokesman, Vince Zito, responded by phone that Williams based his assessment on his background as Texas secretary of state, whose duties include border issues, and past membership of the House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. Outside analysis Before hearing back from CBP, we connected with experts including Christopher Wilson, deputy director of the Mexico Institute at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars. Wilson advised that only a handful of Mexico-based carriers currently haul cargo beyond the commercial zones along the border. Reason: It’s often unprofitable, Wilson and Juan Carlos Villa, who studies freight traffic across the border for the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, told us by phone. A key issue is that under ""cabotage"" regulations, a truck that originates in Mexico may drop off goods in the U.S. interior but can’t also move goods solely within the U.S. And, Villa said, while a Mexico-rooted truck may haul a U.S. load back to Mexico, lining up such cargo can prove difficult, causing costly delays. In contrast, the alternative--driving an empty trailer back to Mexico--""doesn’t make business sense,"" Villa said. A web search led us to 2012 Department of Homeland Security guidelines confirming the described limits. Another deterrence to long-haul trucks venturing into the interior from Mexico, Wilson said, are the typically long delays at border crossings. As a result, Wilson said, it's more commonplace for other trucks to trundle cargo into the U.S. commercial zones where transfers are then made to U.S. lines, a practice called drayage. Wilson, asked to appraise Williams’ claim, said: ""I don’t  know what kind of inspection he means. We don’t allow anyone into the United States without some level of inspection."" Officials don’t open every car trunk, every suitcase or every cargo load, he said, but all vehicles are scanned for nuclear material and some are subject to x-ray checks. ""My interpretation of what ‘good inspection’ means is using intelligence to selectively inspect at varying degrees and with various tools"" each vehicle’s ""cargo based on an evaluation of risk. And that is what we do on the border today,"" Wilson said. ""In that sense, no one makes it across without inspection."" To our query, Villa estimated that 99.9 percent of Mexico-based trucks entering the U.S. stay within the border commercial zones. Also, Villa said, every truck is screened for safety at the border by the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (in the Department of Transportation) and, in Texas, the Texas Department of Public Safety -- with the CBP handling security screenings. When we asked the FMCSA about trucks going uninspected, spokesman Duane DeBruyne said by email that Mexico-based trucks permitted to bring goods beyond the border are randomly selected for border safety inspections. Also, DeBruyne said, each interior-bound truck must display a Commercial Vehicle Safety Alliance decal to operate in the U.S. He said the decals must be renewed via a ""thorough safety"" inspection every 90 days. More detail: A March 2002 agency ""fact sheet"" on NAFTA-related transportation regulations states: ""Mexican-domiciled carriers"" entering the U.S. are required to have a drug and alcohol-testing program, a system of compliance with U.S. federal hours-of-service requirements, adequate data and safety management systems, and valid insurance with a U.S.-registered insurance company. Villa said each border security screening starts with a CBP officer looking at a truck and checking an electronic manifest of the truck’s contents including information about the driver. The agency’s system then guides the officer on whether to let the truck exit into the country or proceed to a secondary inspection, Villa said, which could involve X-rays and unpacking cargo. If a shipment is registered with a U.S. program intended to ease movement of goods, Villa said, the truck is usually directed to exit without secondary inspection. CBP describes its Free and Secure Trade program as a ""commercial clearance program for known low-risk shipments"" entering the country that allows ""expedited processing for commercial carriers who have completed background checks and fulfill certain eligibility requirements."" Participation, CBP says, ""requires that every link in the supply chain, from manufacturer to carrier to driver to importer, is certified under the Customs-Trade Partnership Against Terrorism (C-TPAT) program,"" a public-private partnership focused on protecting the supply chain, identifying security gaps and implementing security measures. Customs & Border Protection CBP spokesman Roger Maier ultimately sent an email describing the agency’s border role in a similar way. ""All commercial trucks entering the U.S. from Mexico are subject to CBP inspection,"" Maier said. ""CBP also receives advance cargo manifest information on all shipments arriving at ports of entry. Some shipment will receive expedited processing if they have successfully enrolled in the CBP FAST trusted trader program."" Asked if a lot of trucks get through uninspected, Maier replied: ""All arriving trucks are met and processed by a CBP officer. Some go gate to gate if they are FAST and there are no issues. Others face some form of physical or non-intrusive exams. All manifests are reviewed in advance."" Our ruling Williams said a lot of trucks from Mexico drive into the U.S. without being inspected. Our research showed that not all trucks are searched, a fact giving an element of truth to this statement, for which Williams provided no specific backup. However, no vehicles cross the border without a visual screening and trucks also are subject to electronic scans and random hands-on safety and security inspections. Also, any truck headed to the nation’s interior is required to fulfill various requirements including a safety inspection within the previous 90 days. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Fake news alert: Claim that famed Latina Trump supporter has been deported is wrong
","Donald Trump alienated a share of immigrant voters during his presidential campaign after making controversial remarks about Mexicans, but that didn’t deter a Hispanic woman from eagerly showing her support for him during a campaign rally. ""I am Hispanic and I vote for Mr. Trump! We vote for Mr. Trump! Yes, Mr. Trump! We love you, we love you all the way to the White House!"" Myriam Witcher said enthusiastically into a microphone, flailing her arms up in the air while gripping an American flag and a People magazine with Trump on the cover. Witcher, an immigrant from Colombia, garnered attention for her lavish praises during the October 2015 rally in Las Vegas, particularly because Trump had presented a hard-line immigration stance, including talk of mass deportation. Soon after her on-stage appearance, rumors spread that Witcher had been deported. A PolitiFact Texas reader recently emailed us saying reports of her deportation were being shared widely, including on Facebook. We wondered, where’s Witcher? Still on U.S. soil, Witcher told PolitiFact. Rumors of her deportation started last year despite being a naturalized U.S. citizen, Witcher said via a phone interview. Though she lives in Las Vegas, Witcher on Nov. 30 said she was in New York. According to the rumors, ""up to this day, I’m still deported,"" Witcher said. ""I don’t waste my time with that."" Satirical post and other sites On Oct. 9, 2015, the day after Witcher appeared next to Trump, a Spanish-language satirical website based in Colombia posted an article headlined, ""They deport Colombian who declared her love to Trump."" Actualidad Panamericana’s 257-word satirical post said Witcher’s return to Colombia was expected after a quick deportation order from immigration authorities. The piece said Witcher’s immigration papers showed ""serious inconsistencies"" and that her real name was ""Miriam Encanto"" -- a spelling variation of her first name and a word for her last name that in English means ""charm."" The post says that Witcher was picked up by immigration authorities while having dinner with Trump, and that enforcement officials showed up after receiving a call from a ""patriot with a toupee."" An Actualidad Panamericana editor said they believe rumors of Witcher’s deportation surged from their post. On its website, Actualidad Panamericana says its goal is to entertain and that all its content is fiction and does not correspond with reality. Talks of Witcher’s deportation are also posted on another Spanish-language website, Coyotitos.com, a site that lacks information detailing who’s behind it and the mission. The article on Witcher and other posts don’t have publication dates or bylines indicating who wrote them. Their Facebook page says they are a media/news company, but they did not return a message requesting more information. Coyotitos’ post about Witcher is headlined, ""Hispanic woman who supported Donald Trump has been deported by the Department of Migration."" (There is no such department.) The article says different media outlets have started to report what happened to Witcher, ""who has been deported for not having legal ‘immigration status.’"" The post warns the information has not been officially confirmed despite being widespread and that it should be taken with caution. Media interviews Anthony Avellaneda, a journalist for El Tiempo, a Hispanic publication of the Las Vegas Review-Journal, said he has occasionally interviewed Witcher. He quoted her in an article posted Sept. 9, 2016. ""She’s still here in Las Vegas. She has not been deported,"" Avellaneda said, adding that news of her removal stemmed from satirical posts. Witcher also was featured in a video published Nov. 1 by a German publication, Spiegel Online. Witcher appears standing outside the Trump International hotel in Las Vegas and reaffirms her admiration for Trump. Witcher says she’s a citizen and sports a Trump campaign pin on her blazer as well as a ""Vote Early Today"" sticker. U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement has an online search page to locate detainees who are in custody or who have been released within the last 60 days. There’s no result for Myriam Witcher. (We checked the database for other variations of her name, too.)

""After immigrating to the United States and becoming a U.S. citizen, she has developed a deep appreciation for our country, and believes with all her heart that Mr. Trump will put America first and make our country great again. She is married to a native U.S. citizen from Texas, who is a veteran of the U.S. Navy submarine service,"" reads Witcher’s book author description. Witcher campaigned for Trump, posting dozens of videos on her YouTube channel recapping his immigration plan and encouraging viewers to vote for him. Gail J.

McAuliffe wrongly links vetoed Virginia bill to North Carolina's bathroom law
","Gov. Terry McAuliffe recently took credit for saving Virginia from passing a law similar to North Carolina’s HB2 act that dictates which public restrooms transgender people can use. ""I’ve had to veto some very bad bills,"" McAuliffe said Nov. 30 during his monthly radio show on WTOP in Washington. ""We would be just like North Carolina with HB2-like legislation. It actually passed our chamber and I vetoed it."" Republicans, who control both houses of Virginia’s General Assembly, quickly mocked the Democratic governor’s claim. ""Uh, no."" the Republican Party of Virginia tweeted. ""Why can't @GovernorVA simply tell the truth about this? Does he not even know what he vetoed?"" So we checked whether McAuliffe’s statement is correct.  It came at the end of a segment is which the governor said he thinks President-elect Donald Trump, a Republican, is not an ""ideologue"" on social issues and wants to focus on boosting the economy. North Carolina HR2, also called the ""bathroom bill,"" was passed by North Carolina’s General Assembly on March 23, 2016, and signed by Republican Gov. Pat McCrory that night. The state law has two main provisions: *It requires transgender people to use the restrooms in many public facilities that correspond to the sex listed on their birth certificate instead of the sex with which they identify. The law applies to school bathrooms, locker rooms and showers as well as the facilities in state and local government buildings. *It set a state definition of classes of people who are protected from discrimination based on their race, religion, color, national origin, age, handicap or ""biological sex."" Omitted from protection are transgender and gay people. The law has triggered a fierce backlash. The NBA, in protest, yanked its 2017 all-star game from Charlotte. The Atlantic Coast Conference and the NCAA pulled collegiate championship games that were scheduled to played in North Carolina this year and next. Financial service giants PayPal and Deutsche Bank froze expansion plans in North Carolina. Rock icons Bruce Springsteen, Pearl Jam and Ringo Starr canceled concerts in the state. All told, Forbes magazine estimated on Nov. 3 that the law had cost North Carolina $630 million in lost business. Now, let’s move north. Virginia Brian Coy, communications chief for McAuliffe, told us that the governor’s radio comment referred to his veto of a so-called ""religious freedom"" bill on March 30, 2016 - exactly one week after HB2 was signed in North Carolina. The Virginia bill would have protected ministers and religious entities from facing government-imposed penalties or civil liability for refusing to perform or host gay marriages. The sponsor - Sen. Bill Carrico Sr., R-Grayson - said it would shield many religious people from being forced to act against their beliefs. Opponents said the legislation promoted bigotry against the LGBT community. The bill passed both chambers of the Virginia General Assembly on party-line votes with Republicans supporting it and Democrats opposed. McAuliffe vetoed the measure on March 30, writing that the legislation, if signed, would send a message that Virginia is ""more concerned with demonizing people than with creating a strong business climate."" You may have noticed that the Virginia bill, unlike the North Carolina legislation McAuliffe compared it to, didn’t mention restrooms. In fact, it had nothing to do with them. It didn’t restrict anyone’s use of bathrooms in state, local government or school buildings - let alone their use by transgender people. In substance, the bill was quite different from HB2. Coy acknowledged those distinctions to us but stressed that the two bills have broad similarities: both are discriminatory and are bad for business growth. McAuliffe ""fully understands that the (Virginia) bill had different language than HB2 in North Carolina did,"" Coy wrote in an email. ""His point is that it would have had very similar consequences in sending a message to businesses and individuals around the world that Virginia is a place where we sanction against LGBT people simply because of whom they love."" The governor, we should point out, offered no such elaboration during the radio broadcast. A final note: There was a bathroom bill introduced in Virginia’s General Assembly that came pretty close to mirroring HR2. The legislation - introduced by Del. Mark Cole, R-Spotsylvania - would have required people to use the restrooms in schools and state-owned buildings that correspond to their ""biological sex."" The measure was killed by a House committee. Our ruling McAuliffe said, ""We would be just like North Carolina with HB2-like (transgender bathroom) legislation. It actually passed our chamber and I vetoed it."" The governor vetoed a bill that would have protected ministers and religious entities from facing government-imposed penalties or civil liability for refusing to perform or host gay marriages. HB2 says transgender people in North Carolina must use restrooms in schools and other government facilities that match with the sex listed on their birth certificates instead of the sex with which they identify. It raises the spectacle of government enforcing a law aimed against a tiny minority. It has provoked protests and boycotts from businesses, sports organizations and entertainers that have cost the state dearly. The two bills are comparable in that they allow discrimination against members of the LGBT community. But they are very different in substance and it’s misleading for McAuliffe to say that his veto saved Virginia from being ‘just like North Carolina with HB2-like legislation."" We rate his statement Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2016/dec/05/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-wrongly-likens-virginia-bill-north-carol/

Rick Scott misleads about the inventors of Obamacare by ignoring Republicans' roles
","Donald Trump’s White House win gave Florida Gov. Rick Scott a powerful ally in his fight against Obamacare. In a Nov. 30 op-ed in USA Today, the former hospital executive reiterated his 2010 campaign pledge to fight for repeal of the federal health care law. ""Other than President Obama and a few stragglers, everyone now realizes that Obamacare was a terrible notion,"" wrote the Republican governor. ""It was sold on a lie. It was invented by liberal academic theorists who have no interaction with real families and businesses and therefore it doesn’t work."" Scott’s piece leaves out that the Affordable Care Act of 2010 is based on ideas from not just Democrats but also Republicans.   Behind the trio of academics Scott’s spokeswoman said he was referring to three academics: MIT economist Jonathan Gruber, Harvard economist David Cutler and Ezekiel Emanuel, who is now chairman of the Department of Medical Ethics and Health Policy at the University of Pennsylvania. We interviewed all three about their role in the Affordable Care Act or with Obama. Gruber developed the economic model for the law, which is part of the reason he has received the most attention in the media. He was instrumental in helping Massachusetts create its law, and the federal government contracted with Gruber to provide technical assistance. The national law was patterned after the Massachusetts law, and they are similar in structure. They both require everyone to have health insurance or pay a penalty; they both leave the current insurance system in place; they both expand coverage for the uninsured through subsidies or Medicaid. While media reports often refer to Gruber as the ""architect"" of the bill, some others who worked on the legislation rebutted that characterization. John McDonough, a Harvard health policy professor who was a senior adviser to the Senate Health and Education Committee when the law was written, previously told PolitiFact that Gruber’s involvement with his economic model was important, but he didn’t determine what policies would be in the law. As for Cutler, he appears to have had the least to do with the law. Scott’s spokeswoman pointed to an October article in Politico referring to him as a ""key architect"" of Obamacare. But most of the articles we read described Cutler as a health care adviser to Obama during his 2008 campaign and an advocate for the law. Cutler told PolitiFact that while he spoke with people from the Obama administration, members of Congress and interest groups, ""I did not serve in the administration and never wrote a line of the ACA."" Cutler also worked on health care during the Bill Clinton administration and is a senior fellow at the liberal Center for American Progress. Emanuel was a paid special adviser for health policy to the director of the federal Office of Management and Budget from 2009-11. Even though Scott called him an academic given his current posting at Penn, Emanuel wasn’t working in academia when he worked for the federal government. (His brother Rahm was President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff.) Emanuel told PolitiFact that he worked on a lot of the details of the bill including the subsidy levels. So to recap, two of the men cited by Scott played important roles in the development of the law: Gruber developed the economic model and was an adviser while the law was being written while Emanuel was also a federal government adviser and worked on details of the bill. Cutler didn’t have a direct role in writing the law although he was a health care adviser to Obama during his campaign. Experts said Scott’s statement exaggerates, omitting the role of many others in the creation of Obamacare -- including conservatives. ""Scott’s comment is so sweeping that it’s hard for it to be anything other than an exaggeration,"" said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. Bipartisan roots To understand the invention of Obamacare requires looking back at previous attempts to overhaul health care, including by Bill and Hillary Clinton. Their proposal for universal health care prompted Republicans to come up with their own alternative in 1993. While as a party Republican senators never reached consensus, Republican Sen. John Chafee of Rhode Island introduced a bill with 18 Republican co-sponsors (although some later withdrew) and two Democrats as co-sponsors. Chafee’s bill had some similarities to Obamacare. It included an individual mandate, created purchasing pools, standardized benefits, and included vouchers for the poor and a ban on denying coverage due to pre-existing conditions. Another key player was the conservative Heritage Foundation, which advocated for health insurance exchanges including when Massachusetts, led by a Democratic Legislature and Republican Gov. Mitt Romney, crafted its own law in 2006. Many experts we interviewed noted that Romney is not a ""liberal academic theorist."" The Massachusetts plan and the national law share the central idea of requiring everyone to purchase health insurance and setting up a marketplace to allow individuals to buy coverage. Jonathan Oberlander, a health care policy specialist at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, said that liberal academics represented a part -- but not the entirety -- of the creators of the federal law. ""There were many cooks in this kitchen and these ideas were generated over a long period over time,"" he said. ""Ideas such as the individual mandate, exchange and private insurer competition had previously been advocated by conservative health policy analysts and Republican politicians—in many respects the ACA’s design and some of its major policies embodied what used to be core tenets of GOP philosophy on health care."" Our ruling Scott said Obamacare ""was invented by liberal academic theorists."" Scott cherry-picked three advisers supportive of the law with ties to Obama. But he exaggerates by ignoring that many people over several decades from both parties developed the ideas for what would eventually become Obamacare. Most notably, Scott omits Republican Gov. Romney, who enacted a Massachusetts plan four years before the federal law passed, and the conservative Heritage Foundation, which was a strong advocate for the health care exchanges upon which both plans were based.

"['Jobs', 'PunditFact', 'Heather McGhee']","
Did Donald Trump's Carrier deal actually save 'less than half' of jobs headed to Mexico?
","Supporters of Donald Trump have praised the president-elect for working out a deal to keep jobs at a manufacturing plant in Indiana from being moved to Mexico. Appearing on NBC’s Meet the Press Dec. 4, Vice President-elect Mike Pence said the deal with Carrier, which makes heating, air conditioning and refrigerator parts, meant ""more than a thousand Hoosiers have certainty in their jobs and in their futures going into this Christmas season because of the leadership of Donald Trump."" Later in the show, pundits from the left and right raised concerns that painted the deal in a less twinkling light. National Review editor Rich Lowry said the government incentives involved were not ideal, and he doesn’t like Trump threatening to retaliate against businesses with tariffs for moves he disapproves of. Heather McGhee, president of the left-leaning think tank Demos, said the number of saved jobs is overhyped. ""Did you actually read the Carrier letter?"" McGhee asked the panel. ""It started out saying ‘we are pleased to inform you’ and ended up talking about all the jobs that would still be shipped overseas. The numbers I'm looking at say less than half of them are actually staying."" With so many numbers in the mix, we decided to see if McGhee’s claim had merit. McGhee was talking about a letter related to 1,400 Carrier jobs in Indianapolis. Most jobs, but far from every job, at the Indianapolis plant ended up being saved thanks to the deal with Trump's team. The outlook worsens when you factor in that plant's job losses with another Indiana plant slated for closure and owned by Carrier's parent company.  The making of a promise In February, United Technologies, the parent company for Carrier Corporations, announced it would be closing an Indianapolis Carrier plant and moving its 1,400 jobs to Monterrey, Mexico. Trump talked about the news throughout his campaign, using Carrier as an example of how trade deals like NAFTA have destroyed the manufacturing industry. ""We're not going to let Carrier leave,"" Trump said in Indiana, of which Pence is governor, in April. ""Because say what you want, Indiana. I've been talking about Carrier now for four months, right?"" About three weeks after the general election, Carrier confirmed talks with Trump and Pence but did not elaborate. Carrier has had discussions with the incoming administration and we look forward to working together. Nothing to announce at this time. Five days later, Trump tweeted that a deal had been struck, jobs had been saved, and his promise to Americans had been fulfilled. Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state.We will keep our companies and jobs in the U.S. Thanks Carrier We are pleased to have reached a deal with President-elect Trump & VP-elect Pence to keep close to 1,000 jobs in Indy. More details soon. The state of Indiana vowed to give the company $7 million in tax incentives over a decade, and the company agreed to invest $16 million in keeping the company in the state. While many workers celebrated saving their jobs, free-market capitalists balked, including Trump ally and Republican Sarah Palin, who described the deal as ""crony capitalism."" Lost in the jubilation was that hundreds of jobs at the Carrier plant would not be spared from export. On top of that, Carrier's parent company, United Technologies, said it will continue with previously announced plans to close a factory in Huntington, Ind., and move its 700 jobs to Mexico. Behind the numbers So how does McGhee’s statement add up? The best numbers available can be reasonably examined a couple ways. We could not reach a spokesperson for United Technologies for comment Sunday, so we're going by reported estimates in the Washington Post, New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, among others. The first way to add up the number — which doesn’t support McGhee’s point — is by looking just at Carrier jobs. Again, more than 1,400 Carrier jobs were heading to Mexico before the incoming administration intervened. Multiple reports put the number of saved jobs from that plant at 800 union workers, mainly those involved with building furnaces. So that’s more than half, or 57 percent, of the estimated 1,400 jobs that were slated to be lost from the Indianapolis plant. That’s a bit lower than the ""more than 1,000 jobs"" talking point we’ve heard from Pence, Trump and Carrier. According to CNNMoney, that total is inflated by factoring in 300 primarily administrative and engineering jobs held by parent company United Technologies that were not at risk of moving to Mexico. The letter that McGhee talked about on the show was sent to employees Dec. 1. Carrier said it would move forward with its earlier plan to relocate its fan coil manufacturing lines out of the country.   Breaking: Carrier confirms in letter to workers that fan coil jobs will ""relocate"" to Mexico by end of 2017. @rtv6 @IndyThisWeek pic.twitter.com/pcHo5ZPuh4 ""While this announcement is good news for many, we recognize it is not good news for everyone,"" reads the letter. ""We are moving forward with previously announced plans to relocate the fan coil manufacturing lines, with expected completion by the end of 2017."" While the letter doesn’t use specific numbers, news reports have said that the fan coil relocation will cost 600 U.S. jobs. And there’s more to the story. The incoming administration was not able to work out a deal to prevent the closing of United Technologies' Huntington factory. So 700 of those jobs will be outsourced to Mexico. So between the U.S. job losses at the factories in Carrier and Huntington, approximately 1,300 jobs will be moved to Mexico under the umbrella of United Technologies. Going by the broader view, McGhee is right that less than half (or 38 percent) of the 2,100 jobs in danger of being exported actually ended up staying. Our ruling McGhee said that less than half of the jobs from the Carrier deal actually stayed in the United States.   If you just count the number of jobs at the Carrier plant, which is what Trump promised to save and what McGhee referenced on the show, then her claim is not accurate. In fact, more than half of the jobs will stay in the United States because the deal is keeping approximately 800 jobs out of 1,400 at the Carrier plant. However, her statement is correct when applied more broadly to include jobs that will be lost from the United Technologies' factory closure in Huntington, as well as the hundreds of jobs not saved in the Carrier deal.  McGhee’s statement is partially accurate but needs clarification, so we rate the claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/228c9aa4-bea8-420d-b946-dd81fe8327f9",/factchecks/2016/dec/04/heather-mcghee/did-donald-trumps-carrier-deal-actually-save-less-/

Mike Pence says Donald Trump won most counties by a Republican since Ronald Reagan
","With a split in the 2016 Electoral College and popular votes, there’s been an unusual amount of jockeying this year over how to frame the Election Day results. On the Dec. 4, 2016, edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, Vice President-elect Mike Pence used the yardstick of counties won to explain why Donald Trump’s victory was a watershed. ""To be around Donald Trump, as you know, having known him for a number of years, is to be around a man of boundless energy from literally the day after the election,"" he said, ""a historic election where he won 30 out of 50 states (and) more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan."" Is this correct? It is, though election experts say it speaks to longtime Republican dominance in rural areas. A closer look at the numbers We were able to secure statistics for counties won by each presidential candidate from Dave Leip, creator of the indispensable ""Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections"" website. The following chart shows the breakdown in counties won by each party’s nominee going back to 1984, which was Reagan’s last election as well as the one in which he won every state except one (Minnesota). Two housekeeping notes: The data for 2016 is preliminary, and Alaska doesn’t calculate vote data by borough, which is that state’s equivalent of a county. Election Republican counties won Democratic counties won Independent counties won 2016 2,623 489 0 2012 2,420 693 0 2008 2,238 875 0 2004 2,530 583 0 2000 2,397 659 0 1996 1,587 1,526 0 1992 1,582 1,519 15 1988 2,295 820 0 1984 2,781 334 0 So Pence is on target that the number of counties won by Trump exceeds the number of counties won by every Republican presidential candidate since Reagan in 1984. For a more visual look, here are maps showing the counties won by the parties in each of those elections. Note that the 2016 map, from the Washington Post, uses the now-traditional Democratic blue-Republican red color scheme. 2016  The rest of the maps, from Leip's website, use blue coloring for Republican counties and red coloring for Democratic counties. (For the record, Leip started using his coloring code in 1994, before the current version became standard; he says that changing every map on his site would require an enormous time commitment.) 2012    2008  2004  2000  1996  1992  1988    1984  Trump receives credit from electoral specialists for expanding the Republican footprint, notably in places that had previously backed Barack Obama. According to a calculation by Time magazine, Trump won 220 counties that had voted for Obama in 2012, while Hillary Clinton took far fewer -- 17 -- that had gone for Mitt Romney, the 2012 GOP nominee. And Trump outperformed Romney’s vote share in 2,728 counties, compared to just 383 where Clinton outperformed Obama. But the places where Clinton performed better than Obama did were almost always in much more populous counties. According to Time’s calculations, the counties where Clinton gained ground on Obama had a median of 75,554 voters in 2016. The comparable figure for the counties where Trump exceeded Romney’s performance was 9,905 voters. So the median Clinton-trending county was more than seven times bigger than the median Trump-trending county. The divide doesn’t stop at population. Mark Muro and Sifan Liu of the Brookings Institution crunched the numbers on the overall economic output of Clinton and Trump counties. Their finding? Clinton’s comparatively tiny number of counties ""encompassed a massive 64 percent of America’s economic activity,"" compared to 36 percent for Trump’s much larger stable of counties. Here’s a graphical representation of what they found, with Clinton counties in blue and Trump counties in red, and each county’s rectangle scaled to the size of the output in that county:  ""Here you can see very clearly that with the exceptions of the Phoenix and Fort Worth areas and a big chunk of Long Island, Clinton won every large-sized county economy in the country,"" the authors wrote. ""Trumpland consists of hundreds and hundreds of tiny low-output locations that comprise the non-metropolitan hinterland of America, along with some suburban and exurban metro counties."" All of this illustrates a general pattern for Democrats in recent election cycles: They have run strongly in populous and economically growing urban and suburban areas, but poorly in lightly populated rural areas. This has been true for the entire period we’re looking at -- in fact, Bill Clinton never managed to win more counties during his two victories in the 1990s -- but the partisan disparity has been growing steadily. And the pattern reached a new apogee with the Trump vs. Clinton race. This helps explain why Clinton has so far won 2.6 million more votes than Trump did -- almost 2 percentage points more -- while losing so many counties. ""Loving County, Texas, has a population of 82, while California’s Los Angeles County has over 9.8 million,"" said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. ""The number of counties won is not necessarily a meaningful indicator, absent any consideration of the population of these counties."" Seth Masket, a University of Denver political scientist, agreed. ""Partisanship increasingly correlates with urbanism,"" he said. ""There are a lot more rural counties than urban ones, so I'd expect Republicans to be winning more and more counties over time. So the claim that the GOP is winning more counties is possibly an interesting reflection on residential living patterns, but it doesn't really reflect what the voters wanted or what the government has a mandate to address."" Our ruling Pence said that Trump ""won more counties than any candidate on our side since Ronald Reagan."" The electoral results leave little doubt that Trump expanded Republican success compared to Romney’s baseline in many corners of the country. However, it’s important not to overstate the importance of the statistic Pence cited. Clinton may have won fewer counties overall, but the ones she did win tended to be much more populous and economically dynamic. The statement is accurate, but it needs an asterisk, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/dec/04/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-donald-trump-won-most-counties-rep/

Sheri Gallo misses with claim Alison Alter removed from board for terrible attendance
","In a flier mailed to voters, Austin City Council Member Sheri Gallo says her opponent in the Dec. 13, 2016, runoff to represent West Austin’s District 10 ""got an F in attendance in 2016 as a Parks Board member and was removed by a unanimous vote of the Austin City Council."" Not so, we found. Gallo’s claim caught our eye because we remembered the incumbent giving a different explanation in August 2016 when she asked council colleagues to remove Alison Alter from the all-volunteer panel after Alter, a philanthropic adviser, signaled plans to challenge Gallo, who worked as a real estate agent before her election to the council. Just the year before, Gallo nominated Alter to represent the district on the board. The 11-member City Council accepted her recommendation in May 2015 and Alter was eligible to begin her service a couple months later. When Gallo made her motion to remove Alter from the board, Gallo said she was acting after Alter refused to resign. On Aug. 4, 2016, Gallo’s colleagues approved Gallo’s request without discussion as part of the meeting’s consent agenda, which typically consists of uncontroversial items that are passed in a single council vote. ""I asked Ms. Alter to resign from the Parks and Recreation Board because of her inherent conflict of interest due to her intention to run against me for City Council,"" Gallo said in an Aug. 4, 2016, statement. ""It would be difficult for her to represent both me and the District 10 office in good faith while actively campaigning against me."" Gallo made no mention then of Alter’s attendance. For this fact check, we reached out to Gallo’s campaign  by phone and email, seeking the factual basis for her claim that Alter’s ""F"" for attendance preceded her removal from the board. Gallo’s campaign cited those two missed 2016 board meetings in an email to PolitiFact, defending the claim. Separately, we checked on Alter’s attendance history by reviewing meeting minutes for the 11-member parks board. From January to July 2016, the period claimed by Gallo, the minutes indicate the board had six meetings, and a subcommittee Alter served on also had six meetings. Alter missed two of each--meaning she missed one-third of the year’s meetings. But that’s an incomplete accounting. The year before, Alter was absent from her initial full board meeting on July 28, 2015, according to that meeting’s minutes. Yet she was present at each of her next eight meetings of the year--from Aug. 25 through Dec. 8, 2015--including three committee meetings, according to respective meeting minutes. All told then, Alter was present at 16 of 21 parks board or subcommittee meetings until her removal. That breaks out to a 76 percent attendance record, arguably a ‘C’ letter grade. We wondered if the city in any way grades or ranks board members on attendance. At our request, city spokesman David Green emailed us the city’s log of attendance for the parks board; it didn’t include attendance grades or such. Green said too that the city clerk’s office, which tracks board and council absences, doesn’t rank or grade members on attendance. Our ruling Gallo said Alter ""got an F in attendance in 2016 as a Parks Board member and was removed by a unanimous vote of the Austin City Council."" This claim gets events flat wrong in that we found no evidence that Alter’s removal from the board--which occurred at Gallo’s behest--had anything to do with missed meetings. Austin volunteers who serve on city boards don’t get graded on attendance. Still, if Alter were graded on her entire tenure rather than a cherry-picked stretch, she’d merit a passing grade of ‘C.’ We find this claim incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

Rate of spending increases smaller under Cuomo
","The Cato Institute recently issued fiscal policy report cards to America’s governors, and the libertarian think tank gave Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo a B for his ""impressive tax cutting."" But Cato also warned New York state’s spending is rising briskly. Since then Cuomo has boasted about the state’s restrained spending since he took office in January 2011. Holding the line on spending let Albany pass on the savings to taxpayers, he said.   ""We spend less than 2 percent more every year,"" Cuomo said. ""That is the lowest increase in spending since they have been keeping numbers. No other governor has reduced spending as much as I have, Democrat or Republican. George Pataki, Nelson Rockefeller, Republicans. I spend less."" So who’s right? Is the state’s spending rising briskly, or has it been restrained? We checked if Cuomo posted the smallest spending increases since Rockefeller. Tracking the spending The state has kept consistent data on spending since Nelson Rockefeller’s days as governor. The state Department of Budget says the data dates back about 57 years. Data before then is unconfirmed or doesn’t exist. Rockefeller held office from 1959 to 1973, when he left to become President Gerald Ford’s vice president. Malcolm Wilson, his lieutenant governor, served out the rest of his term until 1974. Annual spending increases averaged 11.1 percent during the four terms of Rockefeller and Wilson. Here’s how the other governors, with legislative support, spent since then: Hugh L. Carey increased spending by an average of 8.7 percent each year during his two terms in office from 1975 to 1982. Mario M. Cuomo increased spending by an average of 6.9 percent each year during his three terms in office from 1983 to 1994. George E. Pataki increased spending by an average of 5.1 percent each year during his three terms in office from 1995 to 2006. Eliot L. Spitzer took office in 2007 but remained governor only until 2008 when scandal prompted him to resign. David Paterson, his lieutenant governor, took over for the remainder of the term ending in 2010. Spending increased by an average of 3.8 percent annually between 2007 and 2010. Cuomo’s record Cuomo has approached budgeting differently than other governors. Instead of using anticipated revenue to craft a spending plan, he’s imposed an annual 2 percent cap on state spending. This year’s budget marked the sixth consecutive year of spending increases at or lower than 2 percent. In Cuomo’s six years in office, spending has increased an average of 1.4 percent each year, when adjusted to exclude federal emergency aid for disasters like Hurricane Sandy recovery. Without adjusting for federal aid, average annual spending under Cuomo rose 2.2 percent, still less than his predecessors dating back to Rockefeller. So what’s Cato talking about? The Cato Institute’s report in October says the state’s general fund ""increased more than 8 percent in 2016 and is expected to increase more than 5 percent in 2017."" The report’s numbers are correct, but they do not show the whole picture of the state’s spending. The Cato report refers only to the state’s general fund, not total state spending. New York state over the decades has created hundreds of special revenue accounts that exist outside the general fund. The general fund is the largest but only makes up about 60 percent of state spending. The state has cut spending in the other accounts to come to the 2 percent or less increases during Cuomo’s time in office, according to the Department of Budget. Our ruling At an event in Fishkill last month, Cuomo said, ""We spend less than 2 percent more every year. That is the lowest increase in spending since they have been keeping numbers."" It’s true that Cuomo has enacted the lowest spending increases since state government started tracking that data. No comparable data exists before the Rockefeller administration.

Pence's support for conversion therapy not a settled matter
","EDITOR’S NOTE: On July 28, 2016, PolitiFact California rated as True a statement by Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom that Republican Indiana Governor and now Vice President-Elect Mike Pence ""advocated diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy."" We based that ruling on a statement Pence made in 2000 on his congressional campaign website, in which Pence says ""Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."" Subsequently, our readers and other fact-checking websites examined the claim and made some points that led us to reconsider the fact check. Readers pointed out that Pence never explicitly advocated for conversion therapy in his statement and that he may have been pushing for safer sex practices. Pence’s words are open to other interpretations: Gay and lesbian leaders, for example, say his statement continues to give the impression that he supported the controversial practice of conversion therapy when his words are viewed in context with his long opposition to LGBT rights. Taking all of this into account, we are changing our rating to Half True and providing this new analysis. PolitiFact California’s practice is to consider new evidence and perspectives related to our fact checks, and to revise our ratings when warranted. California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom joined in the chorus of attacks on Donald Trump’s choice for running mate during a speech at the Democratic National Convention in late July. Newsom, a prominent LGBT rights supporter, said Republican Indiana Gov. and now Vice-President Elect Mike Pence ""advocated for diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy."" Conversion therapy is a controversial practice that seeks to change a person’s sexual orientation from gay to straight. It’s banned in five states including California, Oregon, Illinois, Vermont and New Jersey. Our research When asked about the claim in late July, Newsom’s campaign spokesman pointed to Pence’s own words. During his first successful run for Congress in 2000, Pence wrote on his campaign website, under a section called Strengthening the American Family: ""Congress should support the reauthorization of the Ryan White Care Act only after completion of an audit to ensure that federal dollars were no longer being given to organizations that celebrate and encourage the types of behaviors that facilitate the spreading of the HIV virus. Resources should be directed toward those institutions which provide assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior."" Many, including Newsom and other LGBT advocates, have interpreted the last portion of Pence’s statement, about ""assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior,"" as evidence he supported conversion therapy. The statement, however, does not explicitly mention conversion therapy. And Pence has said little, if anything, specific on the topic. We heard from a number of readers who said Pence’s words could be interpreted as supporting groups that aim to not necessarily change one’s sexual orientation, but instead as supporting groups that advocate for curbing sexual behaviors that lead to the spread of HIV/AIDS. Pence has, for example, advocated for abstinence as a way to prevent sexual diseases. ""Indeed, promoting safer sexual behaviour is a common intervention strategy in the fight against HIV/AIDS,"" reader Justin Goddard of Ontario, Canada, said in an email. Other fact-checking websites, such as Snopes.com, have examined the claim Pence supported conversion therapy and concluded it’s not a settled case. LGBT rights advocates say given Pence’s extensive record of opposing gays and lesbians, his words are indeed confirmation that he supported conversion therapy. ""That is very specific language — some might call it a dog whistle — that has been used for decades to very thinly cloak deeply homophobic beliefs,"" Rea Carey, executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force told the New York Times in late November. ""Particularly the phrase ‘seeking to change their sexual behavior,’ to me, is code for conversion therapy."" ""It’s the most likely reading"" of Pence’s words, Rick Zbur, executive director of Equality California, an LGBT civil rights group, told PolitiFact California. ""We view this in the context of the whole record. … You can’t think of someone who is more hostile to LGBT people and people with AIDS than Mike Pence."" Also on the 2000 website, Pence wrote: ""Congress should oppose any effort to put gay and lesbian relationships on an equal legal status with heterosexual marriage."" And ""Congress should oppose any effort to recognize homosexual’s [sic] as a 'discreet [sic] and insular minority' entitled to the protection of anti-discrimination laws similar to those extended to women and ethnic minorities."" Statement mischaracterized? In an email exchange with PolitiFact California in late July, Pence’s spokesman Marc Lotter did not directly answer whether Pence supported conversion therapy. Four months later, Lotter told the New York Times, however, that it was ""patently false"" that Mr. Pence ""supported or advocated"" the practice of conversion therapy. Lotter added that Pence had been calling for federal funds to ""be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices"" during his 2000 congressional campaign, and he said it was a ""mischaracterization"" to interpret the statement as a reference to conversion therapy. Newsom’s campaign spokesman said in November he did not have any additional information pointing to Pence’s stance on conversion therapy. As reported by McClatchy DC in July, Pence continues to be at the center of gay rights controversy: ""Pence angered gay rights groups (in 2015) when he signed a religious freedom bill that opponents said would allow businesses to discriminate against customers based on their sexual orientation. Pence later backtracked, when state lawmakers changed the law to say that no discrimination would be allowed."" At the Republican National Convention this summer, the McClatchy news service noted: ""Delegates voted to approve a platform that backs the right of parents to determine the proper medical treatment and therapy for their minor children. The platform makes no specific mention of gay conversion therapy, but critics say that passage is aimed at accepting the notion that one’s sexual orientation can be changed."" GOP Party Chairman Reince Priebus, who President-Elect Donald Trump has selected as chief of staff for the incoming administration, has denied that passage encourages conversion therapy. Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said Indiana Governor and now Vice President-Elect Mike Pence ""advocated for diverting taxpayer dollars to so-called conversion therapy."" Pence’s own words on his campaign website from 2000, specifically a passage that calls for funding groups that give ""assistance to those seeking to change their sexual behavior,"" have been interpreted by LGBT advocates as supporting the controversial practice. Pence’s statement, however, does not explicitly mention conversion therapy. Readers and other fact-checking outlets have said Pence may have been calling for safer sexual sexual practices rather than pushing for efforts to change one’s sexual orientation. When asked about the statement in July, Pence’s spokesman Marc Lotter did not directly answer whether the Indiana governor supports the practice. Months later, Lotter strongly denied that Pence supports conversion therapy and said Pence was calling for funds to ""be directed to groups that promoted safe sexual practices"" Given Pence’s strong and extensive opposition to LGBT rights, his words in 2000 have been widely interpreted as supporting the controversial practice. Rea Carey, executive director of the National L.G.B.T.Q. Task Force, has called them ""a dog whistle"" for like-minded supporters of conversion therapy. Newsom’s definitive claim, however, that Pence advocated for conversion therapy is not fully supported. We rate it Half True.
