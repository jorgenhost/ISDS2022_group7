Paul Ryan says congressional districts in Wisconsin are competitive after redistricting
","When Republicans took over state government in 2010, they scored a golden opportunity to redraw the lines for state and congressional districts in their favor. For the first time since the 1950s, the same party had control of both houses of the Wisconsin Legislature and the governor’s mansion at a time when the required population-based rebalancing of districts took place. At the congressional level, the drawing of the new borders was led by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Janesville) and resulted in significant changes to the district represented by U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy (R-Ashland), and smaller but important tweaks to the districts represented by U.S. Rep. Ron Kind (D-La Crosse) and Ryan himself. In a Sept. 2, 2014 appearance before the Rotary Club of Milwaukee and the Milwaukee Press Club, Ryan said the state lawmakers had not engaged in the gerrymandering seen in other states, where districts are redrawn in dramatic fashion to favor the party in power. He also credited Wisconsin incumbents with being good at winning reelection. ""I come from one of the battleground districts in the country,"" Ryan said, during a question and answer session after his speech. ""Wisconsin’s like that. We have competitive districts."" When we asked for evidence to support his claim that even after the redistricting the seats are competitive, Ryan spokesman Kevin Siefert cited the Cook Political Report, a nonpartisan organization that follows federal elections. The Cook Report creates a partisan voter index, or PVI, for each congressional district in the country, a gauge that allows you to compare voting for president in a single district with the national results. ""Congressman Duffy’s district is an R+2 and Congressman Kind’s is a D+5, both falling in the ‘swing seats’ range as determined by the Cook Political Report,"" Siefert said.  ""Congressman Ryan stated that both seats were very competitive, and the Cook Report’s substantiates that with its Partisan Voter Index."" The index means that Duffy’s district voted two percentage points more Republican in the last presidential election than the nation as a whole. Meanwhile, Kind’s district voted five points more Democratic. At the speech, Ryan described the Milwaukee-area seats held by Democrat Gwen Moore and Republican F. James Sensenbrenner as ""very much"" favoring the incumbent’s party. He spent spent little -- or no -- time on three seats, those held by Democrat Mark Pocan, and Republicans Reid Ribble and Tom Petri. He focused primarily on his own district, and those represented by Kind and Duffy. But the Cook Report’s expert on the House of Representatives said redistricting made the Duffy and Kind districts -- and Ryan’s -- less competitive. ""If Paul Ryan claims that these seats are competitive, he’s living in the past,"" said David Wasserman, who analyzes house districts and races for the Cook Report. ""That’s preposterous. There are virtually no competitive seats in Wisconsin."" Let’s take a closer look. Changes to the districts At the event, Ryan pointed out that in recent decades the seats that he and Duffy now hold have swung from party to party. The 7th District, in northwest Wisconsin, ""went from Dave Obey to Sean Duffy,"" Ryan said, adding his own district, in southeastern Wisconsin, ""went from Les Aspin to Peter Barca to Mark Neumann and Paul Ryan."" But Ryan compares apples and oranges. Thanks to redistricting  the districts have different voters in them now than when those seats were held by Obey and Aspin. Obey stepped down in 2010, before the latest changes, and was replaced by Duffy. Aspin left in 1993 to join the Clinton administration. And Barca, the most recent Democrat in the seat, last held it in 1995 before losing to Neumann, a Republican. Swapping voting blocks In the 2012 redistricting, significant changes were made to Duffy’s district that gave it more of a Republican base. ""The Republicans’ biggest goal was to shore up Sean Duffy in the 7th and they did so by removing Stevens Point and Wood County from the 7th and replacing them with the Twin Cities exurbs of St. Croix County,"" Wasserman said. That made the district three points more Republican. At the same time, Kind’s district became even more more Democratic, moving from a D+4 in 2010 to a D+5, according to the Cook scale. Ryan aide Seifert notes that this puts the districts in the Cook Report’s ""swing"" category -- which the report defines as those between Republican +5 and Democratic +5. That is a technical, by-the-numbers definition. The Cook Report separately rates each election based on additional factors, such as incumbency, challengers and the likelihood to change hands in the next election. ""Sean Duffy hasn’t had a competitive race in 2012 or 2014 because of the makeup of the district,"" Wasserman said. Similarly, Ryan’s district became more Republican after the latest redistricting, by swapping some Democratic-leaning areas for Republican-leaning parts of Waukesha County. ""Now he’s ultra safe"" from losing the seat, Wasserman said of Ryan. ""You have a R (plus) 3 district and that’s still safe for Paul Ryan."" Here is a look at the state’s eight congressional districts, according to the Cook Political Report’s Partisan Voter Index. The redistricting change came between the 2010 and 2012 elections.   2010 2012 2014 District 1 (Ryan) R+2 R+3 R+3 District 2 (Pocan) D+15 D+16 D+17 District 3 (Kind) D+4 D+6 D+5 District 4 (Moore) D+22 D+21 D+23 District 5 (Sensenbrenner) R+12 R+12 R+13 District 6 (Petri) R+4 R+5 R+5 District 7 (Duffy) D+3 Even R+2 District 8 (Ribble) R+2 R+2 R+2 A 2012 Journal Sentinel analysis of the new districts contained this conclusion: ""The new map also reduces partisan competition overall. While some of the changes were small, every U.S. House seat in Wisconsin that wasn’t safe already became safer for the party that now occupies it."" Good candidates Ryan said that both Duffy and Kind have won reelection because they’re good politicians. ""These guys are good at getting reelected … and these are very competitive districts,"" he said. Records show that incumbency brings massive fund-raising advantages. As of July 23, 2014, Ryan received $5.9 million in contributions and had $3.9 million in cash on hand, the Federal Election Commission reports. That compares with $502,635 raised and $107,901 in available cash for Democratic challenger Rob Zerban. Similar fund-raising advantages are held by Kind ($1.3 million in cash) compared with challenger Tony Kurtz ($35,666) and Duffy ($1 million) vs challenger Kelly Westlund ($119,000). ""But let’s just say one of those guys hangs it up,"" Ryan said. ""That would be a very competitive race."" Wasserman said he tended to agree with the what-if scenario for an open seat. ""If this was an open seat it would be more competitive, sure,"" he said, referring to Duffy’s district in particular. But when the Cook Report rated the eight districts by likely outcomes in the upcoming November 2014 election, seven of the eight were listed as ""solid"" Republican or Democrat. The remaining district -- the seat being being vacated by Petri, who is retiring -- is listed as ""likely Republican."" Our rating Ryan says that Wisconsin’s congressional districts are competitive. He raised several points to buttress his argument, and each has elements of truth to it. But, overall, the impact of redistricting on the seats cited by Ryan -- including his own -- is clear. Seats now held by Republicans Duffy, Kind and Ryan were redrawn in favor of the incumbent in the 2012 redistricting. We rate Ryan’s claim Mostly False.","[('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""The People’s House: more unpopular and politically safer than ever,"" July 19, 2014', 'http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/267794901.html'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""GOP resistricting leaves its stamp on 2012 elections,"" Dec. 10, 2012', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Redistricting pushes boundaries to help a Republican congressman,"" June 18, 2011', 'http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/182754381.html'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Ryan’s 2012 reelection not a given in tense climate,"" July 24, 2011', 'No link'), ('Rep.

"['Rhode Island', 'City Government', 'Debates', 'Jobs', 'Women', 'Jorge Elorza']","
Elorza says less than 1% of Providence contracts go to women, minorities, despite goal of 10%
","During a debate last month on Latino Public Radio with Michael Solomon, then his opponent for the Democratic nomination for Providence mayor, Jorge Elorza said that if elected he would do more to support minority- and women-owned businesses in Rhode Island’s capital. ""We have a goal of 10 percent of city contracts going to women and minority businesses,"" he said, referring to a City of Providence initiative. ""In reality, less than 1 percent of contracts go to women and minority businesses."" Elorza’s statement came on Aug. 28, before he went on to beat Solomon in the Sept. 9 primary. He now faces independent Vincent A. ""Buddy"" Cianci Jr. and Republican Daniel Harrop in the November general election to succeed Angel Taveras as mayor. Elorza has made the awarding of city contracts an issue in his campaign. He first made a claim about the lack of contracts going to minorities and women in an April 16 post to his campaign website that announced his ""Equity in Business Opportunity"" proposal. In that statement, he said the figure stood at ""approximately 1%."" Has Providence really fallen so far short of its goal in awarding contracts to minorities and women? While we waited for Elorza’s campaign to provide the basis for the claim, we found the city ordinance from 1990 that set goals for minority and women contracts. The ordinance is actually more ambitious than what Elorza described. It has goals of 10 percent of contracts for minorities and 10 percent for women, or 20 percent total -- double the percentage Elorza cited. Charles Newton, of the Rhode Island Minority Business Enterprise, pointed this out to us. Taveras’s office confirmed it. The ordinance notes that in 1990 and in the two previous years, less than 1 percent of contracts went to such firms. (In the Providence Code of Ordinances, see Chapter 21, Article II, Section 21-52.) When John Taraborelli, a spokesman for Elorza, got back to us, he said Elorza’s statement about the low percentage of contracts awarded to minorities and women was based on a 2013 GoLocalProv story. That story reviewed minutes of all the meetings held by the Providence Board of Contract and Supply from Jan. 1 to Dec. 31, 2012. Of $185.8 million awarded in contracts in 2012, only $1.6 million -- less than 1 percent -- went to companies owned by minorities, according to the story. Taraborelli also said the campaign followed up with Brian Hull, Providence’s Director of municipal and intergovernmental affairs. Hull said the analysis of the 2012 numbers was accurate, according to Taraborelli. We spoke with Hull ourselves and he brought up several caveats when trying to analyze city contracts and also gave us more up-to-date figures. First, the caveats. Not all city contracts go before the Board of Contract and Supply. The board reviews and authorizes city purchases of $5,000 or more.  Anything less than $5,000 is put out to bid by city departments, so those smaller contracts aren’t included in the records of the board. In addition, for businesses to be considered as owned by minorities or women they must be certified by the state. However, not all businesses that could qualify decide to go through the certification process, which can be lengthy, said Hull. If those non-certified firms get city contracts, they aren’t counted as owned by minorities or women. Now for the updated number. After Mayor Taveras took office in 2011, his administration formed a task force to bump up the number of contracts awarded to minority firms and studied innovative purchasing programs in other cities, including San Antonio, Texas and Bridgeport, Conn. The efforts resulted in an increase. For 2013, the share of contracts awarded by the Board of Contract and Supply to minority- or women-owned businesses stood at 2.3 percent of the $208 million in purchases that year, according to an analysis done by Hull’s office. That’s about triple the equivalent figure of 0.8 percent for 2012. To put the Providence number in perspective, we talked to Newton, the assistant administrator of the Rhode Island Minority Business Enterprise, the state agency that certifies minority businesses. The state has a requirement of 10 percent of all purchasing going to minority or women businesses. That share currently stands at between 4.5 and 5 percent, according to Newton. Our ruling Jorge Elorza said that Providence has a goal of awarding 10 percent of city contracts to businesses owned by minorities or women, but that in reality less than 1 percent of contracts go to such firms. Elorza got both parts of the claim wrong. The goal is actually 10 percent for minorities and 10 percent for women, for a total of 20 percent. And the latest figures show that, in 2013,  2.3 percent of city contracts went to minorities, more than double the outdated 2012 figure Elorza cited. The difference in the 2012 figure and the 2013 figure is large when the numbers are considered in relation to each other. However, even though there has been an increase, 2.3 percent is still well short of the 20-percent goal. Elorza’s larger point -- that the city needs to act aggressively if it wants to meet policy goals in how it awards contracts-- may be valid, but the numbers he uses to support that claim are way off. We rule his statement Mostly False.

PAC ad misleading on claim about Perdue
","As election day draws closer and the push for votes intensifies, the airwaves are being flooded with political attack ads. One new ad for Michelle Nunn, the Democratic nominee for U.S. Senate, makes a claim about her Republican opponent, businessman David Perdue, that piqued our interest. Perdue ""proposes rolling back the clock on women’s health care,"" the ad states. The Nunn camp has already been trying to turn female voters against Perdue with ads about a lawsuit filed during his tenure as CEO of discounter Dollar General. The lawsuit accused Dollar General of paying male managers more than female managers for the same work. The new ad from super PAC Georgians Together opens talking about the wage discrimination lawsuit, which was settled by Dollar General’s parent company for $18.75 million several years after Perdue left the company. The ad closes with these lines: ""David Perdue -- Georgia women just can’t trust him. Michelle Nunn -- Georgia women can always trust her."" For our fact check, we reached out to Keith Mason, a longtime Democratic operative and treasurer of Georgians Together, the super PAC that was launched to support Nunn’s campaign and that is funding the new ad. We asked for evidence to support the ad claim that Perdue proposes rolling back the clock on women’s health care. ""Perdue supports outright repeal of ACA [the Affordable Care Act],"" Mason said in an email. Perdue has had on his campaign website that he wants to repeal and replace the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Mason said. He also pointed us to a news report that Perdue and four of his primary opponents publicly backed a plan by U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, to strip funding for the ACA as part any government spending bill, an effort that led to a government shutdown and ultimately did not succeed. How does that translate to women’s health? Mason forwarded us a link to a Chicago Tribune story headlined: ""Numerous Affordable Care Act Provisions Specifically Benefit Women."" The article said most plans under the ACA include preventive care, and, for women, that means an annual ""well-woman visit,"" breast-feeding support, contraceptives, contraceptive counseling, annual mammograms and cervical cancer screenings. William S. Cluster, director of the Center for Health Services Research at Georgia State University, said there’s an argument for stating that women of childbearing years would be more adversely impacted by repeal of the ACA. Women under 45 have more health care needs than men in the same age group, he said. Prior to the implementation of the ACA, premiums in the individual market were higher for women than for men and the coverage often excluded preventative care -- mammograms for example -- and maternity care, Custer said. ""The Affordable Care Act prohibits insurers from charging different premiums to men and women. It also requires plans to offer maternity care and preventive health (coverage)."" he said. ‘So while a lot of Georgians would lose coverage, or face higher costs with the repeal of the ACA, women may feel that loss more than men."" Perdue spokesman Derrick Dickey said the candidate’s position has been clear. ""David does support the outright repeal of Obamacare,"" Dickey said. Perdue would like to see it replaced with ""a consumer-driven"" alternative, such as U.S. Rep. Tom Price’s Empowering Patients First Act, the spokesman said.   But the ad claim by the Nunn camp is ""misleading,"" Dickey said. ""If the Nunn campaign thinks repealing Obamacare is ‘rolling back the clock on women’s health care,’ they should just say that,"" he said. ""However, they can’t because Obamacare is incredibly unpopular."" Polls indicate Dickey’s right on the public’s sentiment. In a poll taken in August and September, the Kaiser Family Foundation found that public opinion of the Affordable Care Act remains more negative than positive. Among registered voters, 49 percent view the law unfavorably, 35 percent favorably. Opinion tilts even more negatively among likely voters, 51 percent vs. 35 percent, the poll found. Republicans in Congress have repeatedly maneuvered over the past four years to try to repeal or defund the ACA, which was signed into law on March 23, 2010 and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court on June 28, 2012. Some political analysts link the rise of the conservative Tea Party movement and the Republican takeover of the U.S. House in the 2010 midterm elections to the public furor over the law’s debate and enactment. Kerwin Swint, head of the political science department at Kennesaw State University, said he ""completely understands"" the strategy behind the Georgians Together ad claim. ""The Nunn camp and their supporters want to take full advantage of the gender gap by driving up Perdue's negatives among female voters,"" Swint said. ""But if their only evidence for ‘rolling back the clock on women's health care’ is Perdue's support for repealing the ACA, that's pretty flimsy."" The latest reports show about 316,00 Georgians have selected marketplace plans, 57 percent females and 43 percent males Larry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said these type of ads have become standard in Democratic campaigns this year. If its not ACA repeal, its GOP backing of a personhood amendment or backing of stricter controls on abortion, Sabato said. ""Democrats have to do everything possible to expand the gender gap in their direction. Control of the Senate is riding on whether women heavily support candidates such as Nunn,"" he said. ""Republicans will carry men, as usual, and Democrats will win women, but the margins matter."" Our Ruling. The super PAC, Georgians Together, makes a claim that contains some truth. Some women could be hurt by repeal or replacement of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, which has expanded some benefits for some women. But the ad never mentions Obamacare. That’s a major omission. Voters also need to know what Perdue is proposing -- repeal and replacement of Obamacare -- others have tried to do and failed. And you could argue that almost any group helped by Obamacare could be hurt with its repeal. There is a lot of missing context in this attack ad. We rate it Half True. ","[('Emails from Keith Mason, treasurer of the super PAC Georgians Together.', 'http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-04-09/health/ct-obamacare-womens-health-20140409_1_maternity-coverage-health-insurance-federal-health-law\\'), ('""Obamacare and its effects on women’s health,"" ""Numerous Affordable Care Act provisions specifically benefit women, including guarantee of maternity coverage,"" By Judy Peres, Special to the Chicago Tribune, April 9th, 2014', 'No link'), ('Interview with Derrick Dickey, spokesman for Perdue.', 'https://perduesenate.com/issues/the-issues/'), ('Perdue campaign positions, his campaign website', 'No link'), ('""Health law emerges as biggest issue in Georgia\'s GOP Senate race,"" GOP USA', 'http://www.gopusa.com/news/2013/11/19/health-law-emerges-as-biggest-issue-in-georgias-gop-senate-race/'), ('""Pro-Nunn super-PAC launches in Georgia,"" by Cameron Joseph, The HIll, February 25th, 2014', 'No link'), ('Open Secrets on Georgians Together', 'http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/199151-pro-nunn-super-pac-launches-in-georgia'), ('\xa0', 'No link'), ('\n\n\n\n\n\xa0', 'https://www.opensecrets.org/pacs/lookup2.php?strID=C00557397&cycle=2014')]",/factchecks/2014/oct/01/georgians-together/pac-ad-misleading-/
"['Economy', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist has made mixed statements on the stimulus
","As the campaign for governor heats up, an old charge against Charlie Crist has been revived. A new ad from the Republican Party of Florida calls it ""flippin’ unbelievable"" -- then recounts how Crist has flip-flopped on, well, many things. One of those things is the stimulus. The ad uses clips of Crist’s own contradictory comments before concluding, ""That’s flippin’ nuts."" We decided to put Crist’s position on our Flip-O-Meter to see how its changed over the years. In this case, Crist supported the stimulus, suggested he didn't support it and then supported it again. Throughout, he praised the stimulus for preventing teacher layoffs in Florida. Back in 2009, when he was still Florida governor, Crist supported the economic stimulus, formally known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The law pumped $787 billion into a sputtering economy after the financial crisis of 2008. Crist was one of 19 governors who wrote President Barack Obama on Feb. 3, 2009, in support of the stimulus. ""As stewards of the economies of our respective states and regions, we urge the Congress to reach prompt resolution of all outstanding differences and you to sign the bill when it reaches your desk,"" the letter said. Crist made many other positive comments about the stimulus, including when he appeared at rally in Fort Myers on Feb. 10, 2009, with Obama. ""We know that it's important that we pass a stimulus package,'' Crist said. Crist then backed away from that support when he was competing to win the Republican primary for the U.S. Senate. His made his most notable comments during this period in a Nov. 4, 2009, interview with Wolf Blitzer on CNN. First, Crist criticized Obama for excessive spending. ""You know, unfortunately, the president thinks that everything we need to do for every problem that comes along is spend more money, and that's just wrong,"" he said. ""Frankly, enough is enough. And I know that the people understand that. And I understand it. And I understand it because I'm the grandson of a Greek immigrant who came to this country with nothing, really taught me the value of a dollar, because his first job in America, in Altoona, Pa., was shining shoes for a living for $5 a month."" Crist also tried to disavow his earlier support for the stimulus, saying ""I didn’t endorse it."" Back then, PolitiFact Florida rated his statement Pants on Fire. But Crist also said he appreciated that the stimulus preserved teaching jobs. Frankly, Crist was being simultaneously critical of the stimulus' spending while praising the spending that helped save teachers' jobs. ""Well, I didn't endorse it. I didn't even have a vote on the darned thing. But I understood that it was going to pass and I wanted to be able to utilize it for the benefit of my fellow Floridians. Let me give you just one example of the difference that made. We would have had to let go of over 20,000 schoolteachers in Florida if we hadn't had that support. And, frankly, I kind of look at it like Florida taxpayers' dollars coming back to the state to benefit them. You know, I used to work for a great U.S. senator named Connie Mack, a true fiscal conservative, as am I. And he always, you know, would stress to us on the staff, let's make sure we get Florida's fear share."" More recently, Crist has talked again of saving the jobs of 20,000 school teachers thanks to his acceptance of the stimulus. In a March 2014 interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley, Crist had this to say: ""You know, I'm always comfortable telling the truth, but that turnaround started at the end of my term, and one of the reasons is I accepted the stimulus money, saved thousands of teachers' jobs, law enforcement officers, firefighters. It was the right thing to do when President Obama said, I want to help you, and I said yes as a Republican to a Democratic president not because it was political, but because it was right."" Our ruling Crist initially supported the stimulus when it was passed in 2009 before softening his support of it in 2010 in an attempt to win the Republican primary for U.S. Senate. Now he supports it again. Throughout all of that, he spoke positively about the stimulus preventing teacher layoffs.   His public statements show a partial change of position.

Davis,"" Abbott replied, ""there is actually another thing coming between me and settling that lawsuit. And that is a law that you voted on and helped pass in 2011 that removes from the attorney general the ability to settle lawsuits just like this."" Did legislators including Davis move to keep the attorney general from settling lawsuits? We started this fact check by asking the Abbott campaign for elaboration. Spokeswoman Amelia Chasse pointed to a proposal that won legislative approval in 2011, with Davis among supporters. Then again, it came clear, the legislative leash on the attorney general’s ability to settle cases originated in 2007 action -- more than a year before Davis won her first Senate term. The 2007 law said the attorney general must get legislative approval/consent to settle matters with damages costing the state more than $25 million. The 2011 change lowered the threshold to $10 million. Resolving the school-finance matter would surely cost more than either limit. In 2013 and again in August 2014, state District Judge John Dietz of Austin ruled against the state in the case, though he also gave lawmakers until July 2015 to act. At the time of the Davis-Abbott debate, state lawyers overseen by Abbott were expected to appeal to the Texas Supreme Court (which they did a few days later). By email, David Thompson, a lawyer representing hundreds of districts in the litigation, told us either settlement threshold -- $10 million or the previous $25 million -- ""would be substantially below what it will take to resolve the school finance lawsuit."" Meantime, former state Sen. Steve Ogden, who chaired the Senate Finance Committee and authored the settlement thresholds that passed into law, told us by phone that Abbott can’t settle the school case without the Legislature’s permission ""because it’s going to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to do it."" He and Rep. Tryon Lewis, R-Odessa, chairman of the House Judiciary & Civil Jurisprudence Committee, were guided to us by Chasse. Both said the 2011 action effectively toughened and arguably reaffirmed the original restriction. Here are the details behind the legislation leashing the attorney general’s power: In 2007, according to legislative records, Ogden, R-Bryan, won passage of Senate Bill 2031,which required legislative consent or approval of the settlement or compromise of a claim or action against the state involving state expenditures exceeding $25 million. Specifically, the law barred the attorney general or any lawyer representing the state from entering into a settlement of a claim without legislative consent or approval. The new law said this limit applies if the settlement requires the state to pay damages exceeding the $25 million in a biennium or if it ""commits this state to a course of action that in reasonable probability will entail a continuing increased expenditure of state funds over subsequent"" two-year periods, which strikes us as sweeping in a possible resolution of the school suit. In May 2007, very few legislators objected to Ogden’s proposal as it headed toward Gov. Rick Perry. A  House Democrat voted ""no"" in that body’s final vote and three Democratic senators cast ""no"" votes when the Senate later agreed to House amendments. Four years later, with Davis in the Senate, lawmakers and Perry signed off on Senate Bill 899, reducing the dollar threshold for legislative involvement. An accompanying analysis, by the in-house Senate Research Center, said: ""In keeping with increased scrutiny of state expenditures, this bill would lower the threshold settlement amount requiring legislative approval from $25 million to $10 million."" Senators including Davis unanimously advanced the reduction to the House, where it won approval with one Republican voting ""no."" To recap: Davis was not in the Legislature when lawmakers initially limited the attorney general’s ability to settle cases. She was a member of the Senate that approved a toughening. We asked Abbott’s office to explain how, day to day, the limit has been applied to cases. A spokesman, Jerry Strickland, replied after we initially published this fact check, saying by email: ""Procedurally, when a settlement may implicate the statute, the opposing party is notified that any settlement reached will be subject to legislative approval. The terms of the settlement are negotiated before the settlement is brought to the Legislature. The Legislature can then approve, reject or request modifications to a settlement.""  We also asked about the attorney general’s biennial reports to lawmakers on such settlements; such reports were required by the 2007 law. Each biennium, Strickland said, the agency ""provides privileged attorney-client communications concerning potential settlements requiring legislative approval. If a settlement is reached, the settlement is presented to the Legislature for consideration."" Our ruling Abbott said Davis voted for a 2011 measure that removes the attorney general’s ability to settle lawsuits like the school funding case. That’s not so; a 2007 law created the legislative hurdle for major settlements -- and, significantly, Davis wasn’t a senator then. Still, this claim has an element of truth because Davis joined nearly every other lawmaker in tightening the limit in 2011 by reducing the threshold for settlements the attorney general may reach without legislative sign-off to those costing the state $10 million or less. Given how Abbott characterized the law at issue, we rate his claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Charlie Crist has changed positions several times on support for the federal health care law
","Charlie Crist’s gubernatorial campaign has been peppered by Republicans claiming he’s changed positions on a number of issues, but perhaps the most cited is his position on the Affordable Care Act. A campaign commercial from the Republican Party of Florida says his change of heart on Obamacare is ""flippin’ amazing,"" showing that he first wanted to repeal the law, but now is for it. We decided to put Crist’s position on the health care law to our Flip-O-Meter to see whether he’s had a true change of heart. The charge has dogged him since he ran for Senate in 2010 -- at one time, opponent Marco Rubio accused him of having ""six different positions"" on the health care law. We rated that Half True, because we really counted three. Crist said in the 2010  race he wanted to repeal the law, but he has also said he wanted to modify the law, and he currently supports the Affordable Care Act as a Democrat. The commercial cites a March 28, 2010, debate on Fox News with Rubio in which Crist says, ""I think what we need to do is go ahead and repeal this thing,"" referring to the health care law. It then changes to a March 9, 2014, interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley, saying ""I think it’s been great"" when asked about the law. We found that Crist called for repeal in a March 21, 2010, Associated Press article while the U.S. House was voting on the bill. At that time, he was trying to win the Republican primary against Rubio. By July 20, when he had given up on the Republican nomination and was running as an independent, Crist was backing off of that position. The Wall Street Journal wrote that  ""Despite pledging as a Republican to help repeal President Obama's health-care overhaul, Mr. Crist now says he does not support such a move."" Then on July 29, Crist issued a press release that seemed to take two positions at once. It read, in part: ""Had I been in the United States Senate at the time, I would have voted against the bill because of unacceptable provisions like the cuts to the Medicare Advantage program. But being an independent, I have the freedom to be an honest broker for the people of Florida without regard for political party, and the reality is this: despite its serious flaws, the Obama health care bill does have some positive aspects. Repeal must be accompanied by a responsible substitute -- repeal without passage of a substitute law protecting those with pre-existing conditions, closing the prescription drug donut hole for seniors, and allowing parents to keep their children on their insurance coverage until age 26 would be wrong. While I would not have supported the legislation, we have to recognize the positive components and work together across party lines to make our health care system more affordable for both consumers and the government."" So, he would have voted against it, but was now part of the repeal and replace crowd. But we’re not done yet. On Aug. 27, he told Central Florida News 13, ""I would have voted for it but I think it can be done better."" So he was saying he would have helped pass the law, but focused the rest of the conversation on how he didn’t like provisions for Medicare. Two hours later, he issued a press release that basically repeated the July 29 release, saying he wanted to ""be abundantly clear."" Crist ended up losing that Senate race as an independent, but once Crist became a Democrat, his position did a complete 180-degree turn for good. In the March 2014 interview with Crowley, Crist said the law was ""great"" and that Democratic candidates should be more vocal in supporting the law. ""They ought to strengthen up,"" he said. ""The president's a smart guy and he's doing the right thing, and God bless him for it."" Our ruling As a Republican, Crist was clear in his adherence to the party line by saying the Affordable Care Act should be repealed. When running for Senate, he seemed to contradict himself at times by saying he would have voted against the law, but also that it should be repealed or modified. Then he said he would have voted for Obamacare, but wanted parts of it changed, specifically portions dealing with cuts to Medicare. In this campaign, he clearly supports the Affordable Care Act. That’s about as big a flip as you can get from saying he wouldn’t have voted for it in the first place. We rate this one a Full Flop.","[('CNN, Interview with Charlie Crist, March 9, 2014', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KQWrpxjlIds'), ('Associated Press, ""Crist hopes to repeal health care legislation,"" March 21, 2010', 'No link'), ('Fox News, ""Rubio, Crist Debate on Fox News,"" March 28, 2010', 'http://www2.tbo.com/content/2010/mar/21/crist-hopes-repeal-health-care-legislation/'), ('The Wall Street Journal, ""Crist uses his old party as new foil,"" July 20, 2010', 'No link'), ('The Wall Street Journal blog Washington Wire, ""Q and A with Charlie Crist,"" July 20, 2010', 'http://liveshots.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/03/28/rubiocrist-debate-on-fox-news/'), ('Charlie Crist U.S. Senate campaign press release, ""FACT Check: My position, The Obama health care bill,"" July 29, 2010', 'No link'), ('Marco Rubio campaign press release, ""Statement By Marco Rubio On Crist’s Sixth Position On ObamaCare,"" Aug. 27, 2010', 'https://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704229004575371810495691530.html?KEYWORDS=crist'), ('Marco Rubio campaign press release, ""Crist alters position on ObamaCare for 7th time,"" Aug. 29, 2010', 'No link'), ('Central Florida News 13, ""Gov.

"['Abortion', 'National', 'Women', 'Joni Ernst']","
Braley, Ernst debate anti-abortion legislation impact
","Rep. Bruce Braley, D-Iowa, says his opponent in the Senate race, Republican state Sen. Joni Ernst, introduced legislation that would have severely limited abortion rights in Iowa. Not so, Ernst countered in a recent debate. Braley and Ernst -- who are vying to succeed retiring Democrat Tom Harkin in one of the nation’s tightest and most-watched Senate contests -- butted heads over core issues, including women’s rights, in the Sept. 28, 2014, debate in Des Moines. At one point, the candidates were asked if they would pursue abortion-related legislation at the federal level. Braley responded first. (Video here.) ""What I won't do,"" Braley said, ""is support the type of legislation that Sen. Ernst introduced in Iowa that would have banned all forms of abortion, that would have prevented certain forms of contraception from being available to Iowa women, that would have prevented in vitro fertilization and would have prosecuted doctors for performing what are now legal procedures."" Ernst responded, ""The amendment that's being referenced by the congressman would not do any of the things that he stated it would do. That amendment is simply a statement that I support life."" This debate has come up before: Earlier this month, Braley released an ad that attacked Ernst on the same grounds. We decided to take a closer look to see whose portrayal was more accurate. In April 2013, Ernst joined 20 other Iowa state senators in sponsoring ""personhood"" legislation. Had it passed, the measure would have amended the state Constitution to legally define someone as a ""person"" at conception. The U.S. Supreme Court currently defines a ""person"" when the fetus is at a stage of ""post-viability,"" said Tim Hagle, a politics and constitutional law professor at the University of Iowa. Ernst has said she believes life begins at conception. At a Republican Senate primary debate in May, she said if a personhood bill passes, she thinks abortion providers ""should be punished."" Abortion-rights supporters have criticized such ""personhood"" laws -- which have been proposed in several other states, without having passed -- as creating a legal avenue for lawmakers to restrict women’s access to certain reproductive services. Braley, for instance, said the proposed Iowa legislation would have done a number of things: banned all abortions, prevented access to certain forms of contraception, stopped in vitro fertilization and left doctors open to prosecution. However, that’s speculation -- because at only 200 words, the measure doesn’t include any of those provisions. The measure would have changed the state’s Constitution to say: ""The inalienable right to life of every person at any stage of development shall be recognized and protected."" Unlike some measures in other states, it did not specifically define the term ""person."" Although it doesn’t include those specific measures Braley mentioned, the bill’s main sponsor has said the intent behind many personhood bills is to pave a road to protect anti-abortion legislation in the future because they would give legal rights to unborn fetuses. ""In and of itself, (the resolution) doesn’t change a whole lot,"" Republican state Sen. Dennis Guth told the University of Iowa student newspaper. ""But it ensures that if pro-life legislation is passed, it won’t be struck down by the Iowa Supreme Court. It’s a supporting document."" And if that’s the case, then personhood legislation could provide legal justification for prosecuting anyone who harms a human embryo beginning at conception. This would effectively make abortions illegal, and it could endanger at least some forms of birth control. Some common birth control methods, like intrauterine devices and ""Plan-B,"" can prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus. (Such forms of birth control were also the ones at issue in the Hobby Lobby Supreme Court case earlier this year.) Ernst has expressed wider acceptance of birth control measures than she has about access to abortion. ""When it does come to a woman's access to contraception, I will always stand with our women on affordable access to contraception,"" she said in Sunday’s debate. ""That's something that Congressman Braley has been trying to mislead our women voters on. I do believe in a woman's right to contraception."" In-vitro fertilization practices -- when a child is conceived in a lab outside of the body -- could also be affected. In-vitro fertilization specialists often create multiple embryos for one client. After the woman conceives, the remaining embryos may be discarded. If a personhood measure takes effect, it would be illegal to dispose of these extra embryos, and the state could be obligated to find women to gestate them, said Sylvia Law, a professor of law and medicine at New York University. So it’s not hard to imagine impacts of a personhood measure on all of the areas Braley cited -- abortion, contraception, in-vitro fertilization and a risk of prosecution for physicians. But it’s also short of a guarantee that any of these restrictions could come to pass. Experts we interviewed said the law that Ernst sponsored is too ambiguous to predict its legal ramifications. ""The amendment, if adopted, may lead to all the effects noted by Bruce Braley, but it remains uncertain since no personhood amendment has yet been passed (in other states),"" added Maya Manian, a professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law and an expert in reproductive health care. In addition, these more restrictive policies couldn’t take effect without overcoming additional hurdles, including overturning federal law, which currently protects women’s right to an abortion, said I. Glenn Cohen, codirector of the Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics at Harvard University. ""Even if it purported to have the effect Braley is worried about, the U.S. federal Constitution is the supreme law of the land and trumps Iowa's state Constitution,"" Cohen said. Our ruling Ernst said personhood legislation she sponsored would not have restricted access to reproductive services and was ""simply a statement that I support life."" Both Braley and Ernst have exaggerated here. Ernst has a point that the legislation does not literally call for the restrictions on reproductive rights Braley cited, but it’s more than just a ""statement"" of principle -- it would change the Iowa Constitution in a way that could, at some point, enable many or all of the consequences Braley foresees to be enacted. We rate Ernst’s claim Half True.","[('Iowa Senate Joint Resolution 10, introduced April 25, 2013', 'http://legiscan.com/IA/bill/SJR10/2013'), ('Des Moines Register, ""Exchanges on the issues: Abortion,"" Sept. 30, 2014', 'No link'), ('Des Moines Register, ""Twenty-one Iowa Senate members back fetal ‘personhood’ amendment to state constitution,"" April 25, 2013', 'http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/elections/2014/09/29/exchanges-on-the-issues-abortion/16411559/'), ('KCRG, ""FACT CHECK: Braley hits Ernst on abortion,"" Sept. 19, 2014', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""Mississippi’s Ambiguous ‘Personhood’ Amendment,"" Oct. 31, 2011', 'http://blogs.desmoinesregister.com/dmr/index.php/2013/04/25/twenty-one-iowa-senate-members-back-fetal-personhood-amendment-to-state-constitution/article?nclick_check=1'), ('American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Statement on Personhood Measures, Feb. 10, 2012', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, ""Democratic group claims Cory Gardner backs bill to \'ban all abortions,\'"" Aug. 28, 2014', 'http://www.kcrg.com/subject/news/fact-check-braley-hits-ernst-on-abortion-20140919'), ('PolitiFact, ""Women\'s group says Paul Ryan would ‘outlaw in vitro fertilization,’"" Aug. 17, 2012', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Ernst spokeswoman Gretchen Hamel, Sept. 29, 2014', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/31/opinion/mississippis-ambiguous-personhood-amendment.html?_r=2&'), ('Email and phone interviews, Braley spokesman Sam Lau, Sept. 29, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interview, I.

"['National', 'Education', 'Federal Budget', 'Joni Ernst']","
Joni Ernst says 94 percent of Education Department employees are 'nonessential'
","The U.S. Education Department is often a political football in debates about the role of the federal government. Look no further than the Iowa Senate debate on Sept. 28, 2014, between Republican Joni Ernst and Democrat Bruce Braley. During the audience-participation part of the debate, a local college student named Jake asked Ernst this question: ""You've said you'd like to eliminate the Department of Education. What implications does this have for students who receive Pell Grants and federal student loans?"" Here’s Ernst’s response. ""Thank you, Jake, that's a great question. It doesn't do anything to those that receive Pell Grants and student loans. Those are programs that are very necessary for our college students, but they can be easily housed in the Department of Treasury. Now when it comes to the Department of Education, 94 percent of those that are employed by the Department of Education at the federal level were deemed by the department as nonessential employees. So I would rather see the dollars that go to those nonessential employees be directed back to the states so they can be utilized by our administrators and our teachers in making sure that our Iowa students are receiving a great education."" Is Ernst correct that 94 percent of employees at the Education Department have been ""deemed by the department as nonessential""? Her campaign didn’t return an inquiry, but we took a closer look. First, some background. A government shutdown happens when one particular kind of federal funding stops flowing -- money that’s appropriated by Congress. Appropriations bills are supposed to be passed annually, though in recent years, acrimony between Congress and the president has made it happen more irregularly. This occurred most recently from Oct. 1, 2013, to Oct 16, 2013, when congressional Republicans refused to fund President Barack Obama’s health care law and Obama refused to sign spending bills unless they included funding for the law. There is a grain of truth to back up Ernst’s claim. During the 2013 shutdown, the Education Department furloughed 3,983 employees out of a workforce of 4,195. That’s 94.9 percent of all department employees. But the employees weren’t deemed ""nonessential."" While the term ""nonessential employees"" has been used in the media in the past to describe federal employees who are furloughed during a shutdown, the phrase was never officially used to describe employees. The word ""nonessential,"" which has been used since a 1980 memo issued by the Office of Management and Budget, was applied to activities, not employees. The terms for employees themselves are ""exempt/nonexempt"" or ""excepted/nonexcepted."" More importantly, the way Ernst uses the term ""nonessential"" -- suggesting that the employees’ own department classifies them as make-work employees and that their salaries would be better shifted to state education budgets -- is misleading. What prevents an employee from being furloughed during a government shutdown is their performance of ""emergency work involving the safety of human life or the protection of property."" (Some federal employees are able to continue working because their salaries were paid entirely by user fees or trust funds and, as a result, were not held up by a stalled spending bill.) Few of the Education Department’s employees save lives or guard property. The department’s budget is heavily weighted toward paying out and overseeing student loans and aid to schools in the states. It has the fewest employees of any cabinet-level department in the federal government. (The next smallest, the Department of Housing and Urban Development, has twice as many employees.) Since so much of what the department does is to write checks, it’s not surprising that 94 percent of its staff would be furloughed; neither life nor property is at risk. If being ""essential"" was defined solely by saving lives or protecting property, most Americans' job duties would be categorized in the ""nonessential"" camp. Ernst is ""being disingenuous at best and probably a lot worse than that,"" said David Bills, an education professor at the University of Iowa. John M. Palguta, vice president for policy with the Partnership for Public Service, agreed. ""The law makes no reference to whether or not an employee’s work is important, meaningful, and/or valuable to the agency’s mission,"" he said. A final note: Remember when Ernst said, ""I would rather see the dollars that go to those nonessential employees be directed back to the states so they can be utilized by our administrators and our teachers in making sure that our Iowa students are receiving a great education""? Well, the money saved from ""nonessential"" employees wouldn’t do much to help front-line schools. If the roughly 4,000 Education Department employees were magically transferred to state or local education jobs, they would increase the number of state and local education employees by a minuscule 4/100ths of 1 percent, according to our calculations of Bureau of Labor Statistics data. Our ruling Ernst said, ""94 percent of those that are employed by the Department of Education at the federal level were deemed by the department as nonessential employees."" While it’s true that the Education Department did furlough 94 percent of its employees during the 2013 government shutdown, those employees were neither called ""nonessential"" in official documents nor were they ""nonessential"" in any casual definition of the word. The Education Department’s furlough rate was 94 percent because its employees were not saving lives or protecting property -- the standard for being exempt from furloughs. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.","[('KCCI News 8, Iowa Senate Debate, Sep. 28, 2014', 'http://www.kcci.com/news/iowa-us-senate-debate/28308438'), ('CNN, ""Government shutdown: What\'s closed, what\'s open?,"" Oct. 9, 2013', 'No link'), ('Office of Personnel Management, ""Guidance for Shutdown Furloughs,"" Oct. 11, 2013', 'https://www.cnn.com/interactive/2013/09/politics/government-shutdown-impact/'), ('Office of Personnel Management, ""Contingency Plan for the Suspension of Operations in the Absence of Appropriations,"" Oct. 3, 2013', 'No link'), ('Congressional Research Service, ""Government Shutdown: Operations of the Department of Defense During a Lapse in Appropriations,"" Oct. 15, 2013', 'https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/furlough-guidance/guidance-for-shutdown-furloughs.pdf'), ('Office of Personnel Management, FedScope, accessed Sept. 29, 2014', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, ""‘Nonessential’ label is upsetting to federal workers,"" Sept. 25, 2013', 'https://www.opm.gov/about-us/open-government/about-open-gov/opm-plan-for-the-suspension-of-operations-in-the-absence-of-appropriations.pdf'), (""Office of Management and Budget, President's Fiscal 2015 Budget Proposal, accessed Sept. 29, 2014"", 'No link'), ('Email interview with John M.

"['PunditFact', 'Guns', 'Jane Harman']","
Jane Harman incorrectly claims Fast and Furious started under George W. Bush
","Pundits are dissecting the complicated legacy of Attorney General Eric Holder, who intends to resign the position he’s had since 2009 when the Senate confirms his successor. Some have analyzed the move with less accuracy than others. Jane Harman, a former Democratic congresswoman from California and CEO of the Wilson Center, argued Holder accomplished many good things as the nation’s first black attorney general, but he could be faulted ""for being politically tone-deaf."" ""And some of the things he did I think backfired. Not dropping Fast and Furious, which started in the Bush administration, was a mistake,"" she said during a Sept. 28 Fox News Sunday panel. ""Not notifying people about the Khalid Sheikh Mohammed trial in New York before he announced it, was a mistake. And not -- and the timing of the indictments of the Chinese was a mistake. But on balance is, I think his tone and his professionalism and his focus on race were pluses."" Harman’s claim about the origin of the Justice Department’s controversial ""Fast and Furious"" program was flagged by one of our readers. It is inaccurate. President Barack Obama made the same error during the 2012 election season in describing the program’s launch. PolitiFact rated his claim that it started ""under the previous administration"" as False. The ""Fast and Furious"" operation started in October 2009, about 10 months into Obama’s first term. Under the program, federal agents based in Arizona allowed straw buyers to buy guns in the United States and cross into Mexico so the weapons could be traced to, in theory, high-level drug cartel members. The idea backfired when two guns that the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives had lost track of were found at the crime scene of U.S. Border Patrol agent Brian Terry, who was killed Dec. 14, 2010. Investigations launched by Congress and the Justice Department in the wake of Terry’s death found many flaws with the ""gun-walking"" program designed by ATF’s Phoenix Field Division to go after cartels. So Fast and Furious doesn’t date back to Bush. But the idea of gun-walking in general does trace back to the previous administration. The Justice Department’s inspector general noted that the gun-walking strategy originated in the ATF’s Phoenix office under a 2006 program named ""Operation Wide Receiver."" Operation Wide Receiver unfolded between March 2006 and December 2007 with ATF agents based in Tucson. The agents knew firearms were being purchased by straw buyers for illegal use in Mexico but did not go after the weapons. Ultimately, the inspector general’s report found that the agents did not make any arrests as a result of the program and seized fewer than 100 of about 400 firearms that were purchased.

Scott Walker broke 2010 promise not to take campaign money during state budget process, group says
","A liberal advocacy group is accusing Republican Gov. Scott Walker of breaking a campaign promise by accepting millions of dollars in campaign contributions while he crafted the state budget. One Wisconsin Now made the attack Sept. 26, 2014, less than six weeks before the election between Walker and Democrat Mary Burke. The Madison-based group began its news release with this: ""In an ‘Ethics Reform Plan’ Scott Walker proposed while running for governor, he promised he would not accept contributions from the date of his inauguration until the signing of the state budget. ""A review of Governor Walker’s campaign finance records by One Wisconsin Now shows that for each budget he introduced between Jan. 1 and the date the budget was signed into law, he raised nearly $5.6 million from 54,000 contributions."" Our Walk-O-Meter tracks 65 promises Walker made during the 2010 campaign for governor. But none like the one described by One Wisconsin Now. Did we miss one? No. It turns out the pledge is actually from eight years ago, part of an ethics reform plan Walker issued during his brief 2006 run for the GOP nomination for governor. Saying government ethics is ""one of the greatest challenges to Wisconsin's democracy,"" Walker vowed in that race not to accept any campaign donations from the time between the inauguration in January 2007 until the signing of the state budget. But Walker dropped out before the primary, deferring to then-Congressman Mark Green, who lost to Democratic incumbent Jim Doyle in the general election. Walker, of course, ran again for governor in 2010 and won. But we know of no campaign contribution promise made during that campaign like the one cited by One Wisconsin Now. When we posed that to Scot Ross, the group’s executive director, he argued Walker’s 2006 promise ""has never been repudiated in subsequent campaigns."" And he said Walker ""did the opposite"" of the 2006 pledge by accepting large campaign donations during the time he worked on state budget. But a campaign promise from an unsuccessful run doesn’t automatically carry over to the next campaign.   And One Wisconsin Now ignores the fact Walker’s old promise specifically said it applied to the 2007 budget period. The group calculated the numbers for the 2011 and 2013 budget periods. Records from the state Government Accountability Board show Walker’s campaign received more than $6 million during the budget-preparation periods: $2.51 million from January 2011, the month he was inaugurated, through June 2011, when he signed his first state budget; and $3.52 million from January through June of 2013, the period when he and the Legislature took up his second budget. But it’s something of a moot point for this factcheck, given that Walker wasn’t elected on such a promise. Our rating One Wisconsin Now said Walker was elected governor on a promise not to take campaign contributions ""from the date of his inauguration until the signing of the state budget,"" but broke the promise by taking nearly $5.6 million in contributions. Walker made such a promise during his failed campaign for governor in 2006, specifically noting the period would begin Jan. 3, 2007. But he did not make it again during his successful run in 2010.

Warner has mixed record on protecting pre-Obamacare insurance plans
","Republicans are accusing U.S. Sen. Mark Warner of breaking a promise to Virginians on Obamacare. They point to a videotape Warner posted on Aug. 10, 2009 laying out his qualified support for health care reform. Congress was considering Obamacare at the time and there was loud debate over whether the bill would strip people of health insurance policies they liked and wanted to keep. Warner, a Democrat, vowed he wouldn’t vote for legislation that required such a sacrifice. ""Let me make clear, I’m not going to support a health care reform plan that’s going to take away health care that you’ve got right now or a health care plan that you like,"" he said. Warner went on to vote for Obamacare in December 2009. And last fall, millions of Americans who buy their own insurance were notified their policies were being cancelled because they didn’t meet minimum coverage standards in the law. The videotaped pledge is getting plenty of play this year as Warner seeks reelection. Republican challenger Ed Gillespie posted the video in January with the caption ""Senator Mark Warner broke his words to Virginians."" During a July 26 debate, Gillespie told Warner his 2009 comments ""prove you were wrong"" about Obamacare. The Republican Party of Virginia last month posted a link to Warner’s videotaped statement and tweeted, ""Five years ago, @Mark Warner made the promise he broke."" And on Sept. 9, Gillespie began airing a TV ad featuring the tape of Warner’s pledge and the false claim in capital letters, that our colleagues at PolitiFact National cited it as the ""Lie of the Year"" in 2013. We’ve rated Gillespie’s claim False; the Lie of the Year focused remarks on repeated remarks about the ACA by President Barack Obama. Warner’s name never came up in PolitiFact National’s announcements of the award. But there’s no doubt Warner’s pledge is an issue this fall. So we decided to pull out the Flip-O-Meter and examine whether Warner had changed his stance in protecting insurance people’s insurance plans. Let’s start with some history. What happened The Affordable Care Act was signed into law on March 23, 2010, requiring that all Americans have health insurance and that policies bought after that date meet minimum coverage standards. Policies in effect prior to the bill signing were exempt from the new requirements. Many Democrats said the exemption was important because it addressed a key argument against the healthcare bill: That Obamacare would strip people of health insurance plans they liked. Conservatives predicted many employers would be unwilling to comply with the minimum coverage standards and find it cheaper to stop providing insurance, pay a federal fine, and let their workers buy policies on exchanges that would be set up under the law. But the bill approved by the Democratic-controlled Congress gave President Barack Obama wiggle room on the exemption. Lawmakers left it to the White House to develop the specific rules on how it would work. Obama repeatedly had promised that people who liked their insurance plans could keep them. He undercut his pledge in June 2010, however, by imposing tough regulations that prevented insurers from adjusting their grandfathered plans to market conditions or offering them to new clients. That all but assured the insurers would pull the plug on substandard plans. The major impact, however, has not been on work-based insurance, as originally predicted.  Many employers were already providing coverage that exceeded the standards. The Congressional Budget Office, in a May 2013 study, estimated that the ACA will cause 11 million to lose their employer-based insurance by 2019. That comes to 7 percent of the 157 million people in the U.S. now covered through work. Instead, the brunt has fallen on people who buy their own policies. Insurers began sending notices last fall saying their policies would be eliminated in 2014 because they did not comply with ACA standards. No one knows how many people got notices because the health insurance market is largely private and fragmented. The Washington Post and NBC News reported last fall that their sources estimated between 7 million and 12 million people might be affected. About 16 million people in the U.S. are privately assured, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Obama, last fall, apologized for the ""assurances"" he gave people about keeping their coverage plans. And he’s given state legislatures the option of allowing insurers to keep substandard plans in effect until Oct 1, 2016. What Warner says now Warner essentially says he couldn’t keep his 2009 pledge because he was blindsided by Obama. ""Once the law was implemented, it quickly became clear that this provision had been implemented in such a way that many individuals were having their plans cancelled, despite the administration's promise,"" David Turner, a spokesman for Warner’s campaign, wrote to us in email. Turner referred to fact checks published by the Associated Press and PolitiFact National in early August 2009, around the time Warner made his pledge. Both gave credence to Obama’s ""like it, keep it"" assurances, but noted conditions could undercut the president’s promise. PolitiFact National, back then, rated the president’s claim Half True. Turner also cited language in the ACA that encouraged Warner to vote for the bill. The law says, ""Nothing in this Act (or an amendment made by this Act) shall be construed to require that an individual terminate coverage under a group health plan or health insurance coverage in which such individual was enrolled on the date of enactment of this Act."" The ACA says, ""With respect to a group health plan or health insurance coverage in which an individual was enrolled on the date of enactment of this Act,"" the minimum standards ""shall not apply to such plan or coverage, regardless of whether the individual renews such coverage after such date of enactment."" Finally, Turner said Warner took action last fall when insurers started sending out cancellation notices. He sent us copies of letters the senator wrote to the White House and the state insurance commissioner urging them to extend the cancelled plans. Warner also has been urging the General Assembly to pass legislation that would allow insurers to continue offering subpar health plans in Virginia until Oct. 1, 2016. We spoke to a couple of health care experts and found that their views of Warner’s explanation  coincided with their opinions on Obamacare. Timothy Jost, a law professor at Washington and Lee University who specializes in health care law and supports the ACA, said Warner was true to his word. ""The promise was literally kept,"" he said. ""At the time the law went into effect, people could keep their policies."" Jost said it’s ""irrational"" to hold Warner responsible for cancellations that occurred four years or so after he voted for Obamacare, noting that insurers routinely change plans based on market conditions. ""I don’t think anyone was promising that if you bought a policy in the past, you could keep it forever,"" he said. Gail Wilensky, an ACA critic, kept Warner on the hook. She’s an economist at Project HOPE, an international health foundation, and was a senior health adviser to President George H.W. Bush. Wilensky said a major goal of Obamacare was to provide a ""minimum benefit standard"" and many expected the president to draft regulations that would discourage insurers from continuing plans deemed inadequate by the law. ""It should have come as no surprise to anyone who understood the insurance market, and Mark Warner is a very smart guy,"" she said. We should finally note a Senate vote on Sep. 29, 2010 -- about three months after Obama imposed the regulations with projections that they would force between 39 percent and 69 percent of all businesses relinquish their grandfathered plans by 2013. Republicans, citing that analysis, introduced a resolution that would abolish the minimum standard rules and help people maintain existing policies. The measure was defeated on a party-line 59-40 vote, with Warner voting against it. Turner said Warner viewed the resolution as ""political posturing"" that could undermine consumer protections written into the ACA. During the Senate debate, Democrats said repealing the regulations would essentially strip Obamacare of popular provisions allowing adult children to stay on their parents policies until they turn 26 and banning insurers from placing limits on lifetime benefits paid out. Our ruling In 2009 Warner pledged he would not support health care reform ""that’s going to take away health care that you’ve got right now or a health care plan that you like."" The bill Warner voted for that December had language exempting existing plans from complying with minimum coverage standards. So under a narrow interpretation, it can be argued Warner held steady. But Warner’s pledge weakens under a broader lens. The bill had a loophole: It allowed the president, who promised to protect policies people liked, to fill in the details. Obama, in 2010, imposed tough regulations that made it in infeasible for insurers to continue offering many grandfathered plans. Warner says he was disappointed by the president’s action. Later that year, Warner and all Senate Democrats voted against a GOP resolution to repeal the regulations, even though the White House had begun projecting that many grandfathered insurance plans would be cancelled. Democrats said that repealing the rules would jeopardize other popular provisions written into the ACA. Warner, on the other hand, has advocated pushing back deadlines on the enactment of the insurance regulations. There’s been some back and forth on Warner’s position. On the whole, we rate it a Half Flip.","[('YouTube, ""Mark Warner: Can I keep my health insurance?""

Health insurance costs are skyrocketing under Obamacare, Republican Party says
","Got a beef with Obamacare? The Republicans want to remind voters that Democrat Charlie Crist thinks the president’s health care law is ""great."" A TV ad by the Republican Party of Florida features anecdotes from people making claims about how the health care law has hurt them in the pocketbook or made it harder to find doctors: ""I think Obamacare harms doctors and patients."" ""It increased my health policy, personal health policy, 30 percent."" ""I’m disabled and I can’t find doctors that will help me.""  ""My family’s medical costs have doubled."" ""Many doctors are losing their patients, and patients are losing their doctors. I was one of them."" ""Obamacare hurts my ability to create jobs.""  The ad soon pivots to Crist saying of Obamacare ""I think it’s been great,"" comments he made in a TV interview with CNN’s Candy Crowley in March 2014. Crist has campaigned in favor of the federal health care law while his opponent Republican Gov. Rick Scott has been a major critic. The ad doesn’t identify the various men and women complaining about Obamacare making it impossible to verify each individual’s experiences. State GOP spokesperson Susan Hepworth’s only reply to our questions about the people and their insurance woes: ""They are not actors."" But we can research the ad’s overall message that the Affordable Care Act has inflated Floridians’ health care costs anywhere from 30 percent to twice as expensive. Data about rising premiums There have been various studies about average premium increases since the health care law was implemented, but the results vary widely depending on the methodology and available information. The studies we saw that cited larger increases were generally based on the individual or small-group market and not the category of large-group employer plans. Some predictions that came from Florida officials were based on a hypothetical plan that wasn’t even for sale in the state. The Republicans cited a few surveys showing higher prices. For example, a national survey by the investment firm Morgan Stanley showed Florida was seeing a 36.8 percent increase for individual plans and 20.7 percent increase for small group plans based on the response of six insurance brokers.    But large-group plans were not included in the study, even though those typically represent the most commonly held form of insurance. (PolitiFact New Hampshire noted this in their state as well.) Individual plans, and to a lesser extent small-group plans, have long been expected to produce larger premium increases than large-group plans. That’s because existing individual- and small-group policies likely didn’t include many of the law’s new minimum requirements, such as preventive care with no cost-sharing. When the policies had to change, premiums were likely to rise. Larry Levitt at the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading health policy research center, has said there are several reasons not to compare costs before and after Obamacare. Part of the challenge again is how policies have new coverage requirements, such as maternity care and mental health coverage. The plans people are buying in 2014 are not the same as what they may have bought last year. In 2013, Kaiser explained that overall average unsubsidized premiums for nongroup coverage would be higher because ""many people will be getting better insurance."" Kaiser didn’t have a breakdown by state, but reported national data in September 2014 that showed average annual premiums for employer-sponsored family health coverage rose 3 percent. A 2014 Kaiser survey found that nearly half (46 percent) of those who previously bought non-group insurance and switched to a subsidized, ACA-compliant plan said their current premium is lower than it was under their previous plan, while four in 10 (39 percent) say it is higher. The rate at which those premiums changed is a question mark because of how each study measured whatever they measured, but the anonymous examples cited in the commercial sound extreme to some experts. ""While it would not be impossible for a consumer to experience a ‘30 percent increase’ in his ‘health care policy,’ that situation would unquestionably be an extreme outlier,"" said Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, a consumer health advocacy group. ""The doubling of ‘medical costs’ would be even more extreme. Representing those consumers as typical Floridians would therefore be grossly misleading."" So what are typical premium numbers? PricewaterhouseCoopers released data in August 2014 on individual market rate filings based on state insurance department rate filings and public statements. PWC found a 7.4 percent increase for Florida, a hair above the national 7 percent increase. The report cited a broad range of rate increases in some states and noted that they would likely shrink after regulators reviewed them. Florida’s Office of Insurance Regulation and the White House released different information regarding premium costs in August. The Miami Herald wrote that Florida officials said rates would rise an average of 13.2 percent for new plans in the individual market next year, while the White House said most Floridians who buy an Obamacare plan will pay less in monthly premiums. How can that be? Because they’re each doing different math in order to prove their points. The Florida insurance office, an agency working for a Republican governor and GOP-led Legislature that is against the Affordable Care Act, calculated the average on individual health plans on both the private market and the health exchange, leading to that 13.2 percent rise, the Herald pointed out. The White House was only counting the second-lowest priced silver plan on the exchange in each Florida county. That method predicted an average 4 percent drop in monthly premiums. ""The bottom line is that there is absolutely no way to assess the ad without knowing where the person came from (pre-ACA insurance) and something about their health needs,"" Caroline Pearson, a vice president at health care consulting firm Avalere, told PolitiFact Florida. ""Generally, most people in exchanges were previously uninsured or in the individual market. Most of those people will have much better coverage post ACA, but there are absolutely examples of healthy people whose costs will go up."" Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid for President George H.W. Bush, said there still are some groups who may have seen substantial increases in their premiums. ""These are individuals or couples who had purchased individual insurance tailored to their needs and who were forced to buy more comprehensive and therefore expensive plans,"" she said. Wilensky added that last fall there were many complaints from single people and older couples who had to buy policies with those new requirements. They didn’t need things like maternity care and full dental plans for children, but their premiums went up anyway. However, most people who have bought insurance were those who were eligible to get substantial subsidies, she said. In response to the Republicans’ ad, the Crist campaign sent reporters a copy of a recent Tampa Bay Times editorial that cited numbers that show health care reform is working in Florida -- including that nearly 1 million have elected to get a plan through the federal marketplace. Our ruling The Republicans’ ad shows several unidentified people saying that health insurance costs for Floridians are up 30 percent or more. Many reports that cite big double-digit premium increases are based on individual or small-group plans and omit large group plans, the type of coverage many people have through work. Kaiser concluded that in large-group plans, the largest segment in the market, premiums will rise 3 percent. The Republicans’ ad takes anecdotal experiences about cost increases that would be rare but potentially true and creates the impression that the federal health care law is just one big heap of problems for patients without any benefits. Then it tells voters that despite that morass, Crist supports it. People may see increases to their health care costs under the law, but the typical experience is nowhere near what the ad suggests. Indeed, other Floridians will see their costs go down. We rate the claim Mostly False.","[('Republican Party of Florida, ""Doctors and patients"" TV ad, Sept. 24, 2014', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5t87crJPVYs&feature=youtu.be'), ('CNN, ""Where Obamacare premiums will soar,"" Aug. 6, 2013', 'No link'), ('Forbes, ""49-state analysis: Obamacare to increase individual-market premiums by average of 41 percent,"" Nov. 4, 2013', 'https://money.cnn.com/2013/08/06/news/economy/obamacare-premiums/'), ('Morgan Stanley, ""Quarter 1 Survey: Significant Rate Acceleration Continues,"" April 7, 2014', 'No link'), ('FactCheck.org, ""How Not to Use a Survey,"" April 10, 2014', 'https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2013/11/04/49-state-analysis-obamacare-to-increase-individual-market-premiums-by-avg-of-41-subsidies-flow-to-elderly/'), ('PricewaterhouseCoopers, ""A preliminary look at 2015 individual market health insurance rate filings,"" Aug. 27, 2014', 'No link'), ('Henry J.

Emma Watson: 15.5 million women will marry as children in next 16 years
","Every year around the world, millions of girls under the age of 18 get married, often without having any say in the decision. While this isn’t a bad deal in every instance, the statistics raise many red flags. In too many cases, the move comes at the price of a girl’s health, education and personal safety. The issue shows up in many pleas to improve the lot of women worldwide and was part of an impassioned speech at the United Nations by Harry Potter actress Emma Watson. Watson, who carries the title Goodwill Ambassador for UN Women, noted in a Sept 20 speech that if nothing is done, ""15.5 million girls will be married in the next 16 years as children."" As we began checking that statement, we quickly figured out that Watson's wording was garbled. The correct expression would have been 15.5 million girls per year, and that would be starting in the year 2030, 16 years from now. A senior adviser at UN Women acknowledged the mistake. The upshot: Watson’s figure is a huge undercount. From an article cited by UN Women, more than 140 million women under 18 will get married by 2020. The primary source behind these figures is the UN Population Fund, which in turn relies on data from the Demographic and Health Survey and the Multiple Indicators Cluster Survey. These provide generally reliable information, and analysts at the Population Fund culled numbers from 48 developing nations on women between the ages of 20 and 24. Essentially, to measure how many females married young, you survey those who are 20 or older and ask them when they got married. By convention, anyone who marries under the age of 18 is considered to have wedded early. According to the Population Fund, in 2010, 14.2 million girls under 18 married each year. By 2030, they projected the rate would rise to 15.1 million per year. Why the annual increase? Sylvia Wong specializes in adolescent issues at the Population Fund. Wong said there’s a demographic bubble moving through the system. ""Many of these countries have extremely young populations with larger cohorts of younger girls, who have not yet married but may be at risk in the next 16 years,"" Wong said. Demographer Margaret Greene, author of a Ford Foundation report on gaps in the research on child marriage, said these figures are ""on target,"" but notes that the underlying picture is changing. ""Individual country studies conducted in the past couple of years show increases in (the) age at marriage, say from 14 to 16,"" Greene said. ""But since these ages are both under 18, you don't see many shifts in the overall percentage of child marriages."" In fact, while the demographics might lead to a rise in the annual overall number, underage marriage actually is falling when you compare it to the total population of young women in each country. Using the same data as the Population Fund, two World Bank researchers noted in a 2012 article that ""it is widely acknowledged that child marriage is decreasing."" They wrote that the  incidence of child marriage in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa has gone down by about 20 percent in the past 30 years. The rate used to be over 50 percent. Today it is down to about 40 percent. They said ""progress has been made,"" but the gains have been slow. In this fact-check, our main goal is to examine how closely Watson’s statement tracks with current research. No one can say for sure what the rate of early marriage will be 16 years from now. Gayatri Koolwal is a development economist with Data 2X, a UN project aimed at improving the quality of data related to women. Koolwal said the underlying data is valid but urged a bit of caution. ""These projections over a long period of time are always tricky,"" Koolwal said. ""They don't account for a host of other factors, including economic, political, and health-related, that could affect demographic trends over the same period."" Our ruling Watson said that at current rates, 15.5 million girls would be married as children in the next 16 years. Watson probably meant to say that 16 years from now, 15.5 million girls per year would be married as children. However, the estimate we found from the source cited by UN Women is a bit less than Watson said -- 15.1 rather than 15.5 million by 2030. The annual number masks two underlying trends. First, in some developing countries, the age of marriage is rising even if it remains below the threshold age of 18. Second and more important, the incidence of child marriage is falling. It just isn’t falling as quickly as the population of young girls is increasing. Watson severely undercounts the sheer number of young marriages that will take place between now and 2030. Based on current trends, there would be not just another 15 million, but another 125 million on top of that, a figure that would have bolstered her case. But either way, the statistic ignores that the incidence of child marriage is falling. On balance, Watson's claim is partly accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.","[('Emma Watson, United Nations speech, Sept. 20, 2014', 'http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2014/9/emma-watson-gender-equality-is-your-issue-too'), ('UN News Centre, By 2020, more than 140 million girls will have become child brides , March 7, 2013', 'No link'), ('International Center for Research on Women, Child marriage fact sheet', 'http://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=44314#.VCVz-vldUw1'), ('Ford Foundation, Ending child marriage, January 2014', 'No link'), ('Girls Not Brides, About child marriage', 'http://www.icrw.org/files/images/Child-Marriage-Fact-Sheet-By-The-Numbers.pdf'), ('United Nations Population Fund, Marrying too young, 2012', 'No link'), ('Minh Cong Nguyen and Quentin Wodon, \xa0World Bank,Child Marriage and Education: A Major Challenge, 2012', 'http://www.fordfoundation.org/pdfs/library/EndingChildMarriage.pdf'), ('Email interview, Sylvia Wong , adolescent and youth specialist, UN Population Fund, Sept. 25, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Margaret Greene, demographer, Greeneworks, Sept. 26, 2014', 'http://www.girlsnotbrides.org/about-child-marriage/'), ('Email interview, Gayatri Koolwal, development economist, Data 2X, Sept. 26, 2014', 'No link'), ('Email interview, Elizabeth Nyamayaro, senior advisor, UN Women, Sept. 26, 2014', 'http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2012/MarryingTooYoung.pdf')]",/factchecks/2014/sep/29/emma-watson/watson-155-million-women-will-marry-children/

Chuck Schumer, Senate Democrats flub statistic on layoffs in 2018
","As Americans rushed to file their taxes, the Democrats in the U.S. Senate produced a news release on April 16 that criticized the Republican-backed tax bill that President Donald Trump signed into law late last year. The document began, ""As millions of Americans finish preparing their taxes, corporate executives are laughing all the way to the bank thanks to the Republican tax bill,"" the document said. Executives, the release continued, are ""laying off American workers – in fact, more than 100,000 American workers have already been laid off in 2018."" This statistic is wrong in two ways. The office of Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., told us the 100,000-person count was based on public reporting of layoffs and was not intended to be comprehensive. However, there is a comprehensive number published every month by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. In January 2018, there were 1,784,000 layoffs, and in February, there were 1,647,000. That’s more than 3.4 million layoffs in those two months alone — or 34 times the number cited in the Democratic document. ""Each quarter, millions of Americans are laid off, millions more quit, and millions are hired,"" said Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed.com. ""Even when the net growth in employment each month is only in the range of 100,000 to 200,000, that's the result of far more hires, quits, and layoffs, as people change jobs or enter and leave employment."" Another problem: the implication that the recent tax law has made things worse. In reality, the number of layoffs has varied within a narrow band since the recovery from the Great Recession took hold. According to BLS data, the number of layoffs has bounced around since mid 2010 in a narrow range, between 1.5 million to 1.9 million per month. So there isn’t a significant change in the current pace of layoffs. Here’s a chart showing the number of layoffs in every month since December 2000: Kolko noted that a better statistic is actually the layoff rate, which is layoffs divided by the total number of people employed. This takes into account the number of employed Americans, which generally rises over time. The chart shows an even stronger pattern: Since the end of the Great Recession, the layoff rate has been declining, under both Trump and his predecessor, President Barack Obama. ""The layoff rate is actually low by historical standards,"" said Brookings Institution economist Gary Burtless. Kolko added that nearly twice as many workers today are quitting as are getting laid off, ""reflecting the confidence many workers have that they'll be able to find another job in today's labor market."" The quits-to-layoffs ratio today is near its highest level since 2001, he said. Schumer’s office disputed that they were trying to imply that layoffs had accelerated significantly as a result of the tax bill. Rather, they said the point was that that the bill hasn’t lived up to the rosy promises made by Republicans who supported the tax bill, from Trump to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky. Even so, the available data only covers the first two months after the tax bill was signed, calling into question how large an impact it could have had on preventing layoffs. Schumer and the Senate Democrats said that in the wake of the Republican-backed tax bill, ""more than 100,000 American workers have already been laid off in 2018."" The number of layoffs in that period was actually 34 times higher than the number cited — and the layoff rate has actually been declining consistently for the past eight years.

Did Patrick Morrisey write a health care law for 'illegals'?
","In a recent ad, Rep. Evan Jenkins, R-W.Va., tags his primary rival for a U.S. Senate seat as someone who handed out freebies to undocumented immigrants. In the ad against West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a narrator says, ""In Congress, Morrisey wrote the health care law giving free health care to illegals."" Accompanying this audio is screen text saying, ""Morrisey's Law: $1 billion for 'health services ... to undocumented aliens.' "" The ad is talking about the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. But the ad leaves out important context about two issues — how much of the law Morrisey wrote, and whether the legislation really gave ""free health care to illegals."" Morrisey wasn’t a member of Congress in 2003. Rather, he was a staff member for the House Energy and Commerce Committee. Staff can play an important role in writing legislation, but it would be more accurate to say that Morrisey, along with other staff members and lawmakers, ""helped"" write the bill collectively. ""He could no more dictate the content of legislation than Evan Jenkins’ own congressional staff can,"" the Morrisey campaign said in a statement. ""It defies credulity to claim one congressional staffer wrote all the details of a major 416-page bill."" The law would have involved many authors at one point or another. A bill of that complexity goes through many revisions in committee, on the floor, and sometimes (as it did in this case) a joint House-Senate conference committee that hammers out a unified text for both chambers to vote on. The bill ultimately passed with the overwhelming support of House Republicans and signed by President George W. Bush. All of that said, Morrisey has described his own efforts as drafting major health care legislation. When he was running for attorney general, Morrisey ran an ad and said in an interview that he ""drafted Medicare and Medicaid laws."" Morrisey offered a more nuanced characterization in an official West Virginia government ""Blue Book"" in 2016: ""Between 1999 and 2004, Morrisey served as the Deputy Staff Director and Chief Health Care Counsel to the House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee, helping draft and negotiate major legislation including the Medicare Modernization Act of 2003."" And in a press release when he joined a law firm, a portion of the text said that he ""was a principal staff author and negotiator of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003."" The charge that the law gave free health care to people in the country illegally refers to the law’s section 1011, titled, ""Federal Reimbursement of Emergency Health Services Furnished to Undocumented Aliens."" This section of the law sets aside $250 million a year for four years to reimburse health care providers for the otherwise unreimbursed costs of providing emergency care to undocumented immigrants. So this section certainly addresses the question of undocumented immigrants. However, the ad’s framing is misleading, several health policy specialists told PolitiFact. The 2003 law didn't give ""free health care to illegals."" Rather, a previous law did: the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, signed by President Ronald Reagan in 1986 to ensure public access to emergency services regardless of ability to pay. The 2003 law addresses reimbursements for care that fell under the category of the 1986 law. That brings us to the second complication: The law doesn't give anything to undocumented immigrants per se. Instead, it compensates health care providers. And a third issue: The term ""free health care"" is overly expansive. Undocumented immigrants did not get full health care coverage from this law. The law’s reach is limited to emergency care. The Jenkins campaign dissented from this analysis, calling it ""overly literal."" The Jenkins camp argued that the 2003 law went further than the 1986 law by actually committing money. They added that no one doubts that Medicare provides health care to senior citizens even though the payments are made to health care providers rather than the seniors themselves. Finally, they said, emergency care may be a subset of health care, but for undocumented immigrants, it may be the only health care they receive. We should note one additional point: While the provision on undocumented immigrants was indeed part of the 2003 law, the main thrust of the law was to create the Medicare Part D prescription drug benefit. So Morrisey could easily counter that he helped write a law that provided West Virginia seniors with important prescription drug coverage. The Jenkins ad said, ""In Congress, Morrisey wrote the health care law giving free health care to illegals."" It’s a bit of an exaggeration to say that Morrisey ""wrote"" the 2003 law, but on occasion, Morrisey himself has used similar language to describe his accomplishments as a congressional staffer. However, it’s misleading to say that the 2003 law gave ""free health care to illegals."" The law primarily created the Medicare prescription drug program. One of its sections addressed reimbursement for the care of patients who could not afford services (including immigrants) for hospitals that had already been mandated under a 1986 statute. Also, it addressed emergency care only, not a full suite of health care services.

Record-low unemployment and record-high number of people working due to Scott Walker's policies?
","Two favorite boasts of Republican Scott Walker in his bid for a third term as governor are about unemployment and the number of people working in Wisconsin. He doubled down in this April 4, 2018 tweet, declaring: Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH! We’ll check the two statistics. But more importantly, as voters begin to ponder the November 2018 election, we’ll also examine Walker’s insistence that both are due to his reforms. The figures Wisconsin’s estimated unemployment rate dipped to 2.9 percent in February 2018, the lowest ever, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported, citing the latest figures available when Walker posted his tweet.  The article noted that the figures came from a state Department of Workforce Development report that was based on preliminary estimates from a monthly survey with sparse sample sizes and was subject to revision. The same Journal Sentinel article reported that in February 2018, the state also set a record for the total number of people employed, with 3.07 million. It’s worth noting that when Walker previously claimed, in June 2016, that more people were employed in Wisconsin than ever before, we rated his statement Mostly True, noting it didn’t take into account population growth. Now to the role of Walker’s reforms. Walker’s argument Walker’s campaign cited a number of policies that it links to the two statistics, including these. Tax, regulation cuts: In 2015, roughly midway into Walker’s time as governor, University of Wisconsin-Madison economist Noah Williams credited Walker’s reductions in taxes and regulations for the favorable unemployment labor participation rates. Williams was described at the time as an informal adviser to Walker’s 2016 presidential campaign. Manufacturing/agriculture credit: An April 2017 study by the same economist argued that the credit, which took effect in 2013, has ""accounted for a total gain"" of 42,000 jobs. Food stamp change: More than 25,000 people, according to Walker’s Department of Health Services, gained employment after completing job training that was required under new rules imposed by the Walker administration. To be sure, Wisconsin hasn’t always had high marks during Walker’s tenure. In comparison to other states, Wisconsin hasn’t fared well in rankings for job creation and new business creation. And the job growth wasn’t enough to meet Walker’s promise to create 250,000 jobs during his first term.   A governor’s limited role As we’ve noted repeatedly in previous fact checks, the economy is affected by many factors, including national ones, and a governor plays an important -- but only limited -- role in a state’s economy. Marquette University economics professor James McGibany reiterated that to us in assessing Walker’s claim. McGibany said it’s very difficult to tease out how many jobs were created solely because of a policy change, or changes. For example, he said some of the increase in Wisconsin manufacturing jobs during Walker’s tenure is likely due to the overall economy recovering from the 2008-’09 recession. Similarly, some people who had been on food stamps and later found work likely did so because of the overall improvement in the economy, not specifically because of job training requirements. Moreover, McGibany said, low unemployment and high labor participation are being seen in most of the Midwest, including in states governed by Democrats as well as Republicans. ""The point is,"" he said, ""what is going on in Wisconsin is not the exception, but the rule for most of our neighboring states."" Indeed, even Walker himself has acknowledged there are multiple factors at work. For example, when asked about a week before his tweet why Wisconsin’s unemployment rate is so low, he said it is ""a combination of things -- the biggest thanks for that are to the hard-working employers of the state, because I understand that government doesn’t create jobs, people do … what we did was help create a better business climate."" Our rating Walker says: ""Our bold reforms have Wisconsin’s unemployment rate down to an all-time LOW of 2.9 percent, and the number of people working at an all-time HIGH!"" Walker is correct on the two statistics. But his various reforms can only be considered to be a contributing factor, at most, given many factors that affect the state’s economy.

Cuomo says New York state is ahead of others on recreational marijuana, but it isn't
","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo touts New York state as a progressive beacon for the rest of the country. But his primary opponent, Cynthia Nixon, says that’s not true when it comes to recreational marijuana. It’s not legal in New York state. Cuomo was asked about the issue during a recent exchange with reporters on Long Island. ""Given what’s happened in Massachusetts, California, what could happen in New Jersey, do you feel as if New York is behind on this at all?"" NY1 Reporter Zack Fink asked Cuomo. ""No, I think we’re actually ahead on it,"" Cuomo said. ""We announced months ago that we were going to study the legalization issue precisely for that reason. You have Massachusetts, you have New Jersey talking about it."" Earlier this year, Cuomo asked the state Department of Health to study what legalizing marijuana would mean for New York state. The study will reportedly be finished this fall. Some states have already legalized marijuana for recreational use. So, what was Cuomo talking about when he said ""we’re actually ahead on it?"" What Cuomo was saying Cuomo did not mean to say New York state was ahead of other states that already legalized recreational marijuana, a spokesperson said. He meant that the Department of Health study would put New York state ahead of others in responding to the federal government's new position on state marijuana laws. U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions rescinded an Obama-era rule earlier this year that allowed states to legalize marijuana without federal interference. States with legal marijuana have mostly shrugged off the decision. Context matters here. A reporter asked Cuomo if New York state was falling behind states that already legalized recreational marijuana. Cuomo said New York state was not, and his full response makes little mention of the federal position. States with legal marijuana Nine states and Washington, D.C., have legalized recreational marijuana. The state legislature in Vermont recently voted to make recreational marijuana legal later this year. The other states legalized recreational use through ballot referendums.  New Jersey and Michigan may be next. New Jersedy Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, supports legalization and wants lawmakers to approve a bill this year. Advocates in Michigan have gathered enough signatures to put legalization on the ballot in November. Colorado was the first state to legalize marijuana for recreational use in 2012. New York state, however, is taking steps toward legalization that other states have not. The study from the state Department of Health leaves the option for legalization on the table. New York state marijuana laws Cuomo has been opposed to legalizing recreational marijuana. He has called it a ""gateway drug."" But he supports decriminalizing marijuana -- ending criminal penalties for possessing and using small amounts of the drug. Selling it would still carry a penalty. New York state legalized marijuana for medicinal use in 2014. The state’s program has expanded since its inception, allowing more conditions to be treated with the drug and wider access statewide. Our ruling Cuomo said New York state is ahead of other states on legalizing marijuana for recreational use. That’s not true. Nine other states have already legalized recreational marijuana. Other states have also taken steps toward legalization that New York state has not. New Jersey’s governor has called on the legislature to legalize the drug, while voters in Michigan are expected to decide on legalization later this year.

Is Chicago gun violence really ‘killing’ the city's budget?
","Garry McCarthy was Chicago Police Superintendent under Mayor Rahm Emanuel until getting fired as controversy engulfed the administration over the investigation into the 2014 videotaped police shooting death of teenager Laquan McDonald. Now McCarthy is trying to mount a comeback as a challenger to Emanuel in next year’s mayoral race, with the veteran cop leveraging his law enforcement bona fides to excoriate his old boss for not doing enough to tamp down on gun violence. After formally declaring his candidacy in March, McCarthy sought to tie gun violence in the city, which has soared in the years since he got the boot, to the difficult state of municipal finances. To that end, McCarthy’s campaign website made sweeping assertions: ""Studies show that every murder costs our City a priceless life and approximately $5-8.6 million dollars. Each shooting costs approximately one million dollars.That means the 2016 shooting and murder rate in Chicago cost us about $9.6 BILLION DOLLARS, and that is not even including other crimes like rape, robbery etc.. [sic] However, it is worth noting that the entire City budget for 2018 is $8.6 billion dollars. This math does not work, it is financially killing our city."" A lot of numbers are being tossed around in that statement, which the campaign somewhat altered after PolitiFact inquired about it. A McCarthy spokesman said the wording changes resulted from a revamp of the campaign website. But the gist of the claim still resides on the website, and the implication the campaign makes is striking: In dollars and cents alone, gun violence costs Chicago taxpayers more than they spend on everything else the city does. It is a claim that cries out for a closer look. Pricing the value of a human life or limb may seem a delicate, if not downright insensitive, endeavor. Yet it’s done with frequency. Actuaries apply the science of life expectancy to determine pension and insurance costs. Workers’ compensation experts estimate what an employee would otherwise have been able to earn if not impaired by an accident. Juries in civil lawsuits arising from wrongful death or injury claims are tasked with determining not only the value of a victim’s lost or diminished earning capacity but also compensation for suffering. So we asked McCarthy’s campaign to explain how it came up with the cost figures it cited. A spokesman said the raw material for the calculation largely depended on an analysis conducted by Ted Miller of the Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, a Maryland-based nonprofit research organization focused on public health issues. McCarthy also referenced Miller’s research into the topic in 2013 while still in charge of the Chicago Police Department to argue that it was cheaper for city taxpayers to pay significant overtime for officers than have to bear the cost of crime that would occur if fewer cops were on patrol. Contacted by Politifact, Miller, an internationally-recognized safety economist, said the McCarthy campaign’s use of his data was badly flawed. ""I think they confused cost to the citizens with cost to the government,"" Miller said in an email exchange. Miller’s research does peg the average cost of an individual murder in the millions of dollars, as McCarthy claimed. But Miller explained that his calculations factored in not just costs borne by government but also by victims along with their relatives and employers. In short, Miller is measuring the social cost of gun violence, not the direct cost to taxpayers. In a follow-up phone interview, Miller said he did attempt to isolate government expenses, but the totals he came up with are far smaller than those seized on by the McCarthy campaign: $450,000 on average for a firearm-related homicide and $53,000 for a shooting-related injury. And those numbers come with a cautionary note. Miller’s yardstick measures costs borne at all levels of government, not just the city. For Chicago specifically, Miller estimated the costs to taxpayers of gun violence in 2012--the last year for which he had city-level data, but a year in which McCarthy still ran the police--at $213 million. And those costs were likewise paid across all levels of government, as well as being spread across multiple jurisdictions, including the city, courts, prosecutors, hospitals and more. Not cheap by any means, but a far cry from the nearly $10 billion figure the McCarthy campaign claims on its website. The difference lies in far more sweeping, yet harder to quantify indirect costs of violence that Miller nonetheless attempted to total. They range from wages a victim otherwise could have earned to workplace disruption and ""the financial value of the pain, suffering, and fear that accompany a death or injury,"" as described in a report Miller published in 2015 with Mother Jones. Miller said the McCarthy campaign was mischaracterizing his findings on its website by suggesting Chicago taxpayers were directly on the hook for millions of dollars every time a murder takes place in the city. ""It’s not clearly stating what the numbers say and mean,"" Miller said of the McCarthy campaign claim. We asked the campaign why it appeared to mix apples and oranges, and a spokesman responded by email with a statement that avoided the question entirely. In his attempts to brand Emanuel as a failed mayor whose inability to stamp out crime has led Chicago down the path to financial ruin, McCarthy claimed studies on gun violence support his argument that city taxpayers bear an enormous cost for murders and shootings. Studies show ""the 2016 shooting and murder rate in Chicago cost us about $9.6 BILLION DOLLARS"" and ""the entire City budget for 2018 is $8.6 billion dollars. This math does not work, it is financially killing our city,"" his campaign website read. But the researcher who produced the findings cited by the McCarthy campaign says it misinterpreted his conclusions, which attempted to put a price tag on the total societal costs of firearm homicides and shootings--not just the still significant, but much smaller, costs to city government. McCarthy’s campaign badly misfires in its claim on the costs of gun violence to Chicago taxpayers. It is undoubtedly both a serious and costly problem, but in misinterpreting the very data it relies on the bolster its case, the campaign’s claim earns a credibility rating of False.","[('""Garry McCarthy officially running for mayor of Chicago,"" WGN TV, March 21, 2018', 'http://wgntv.com/2018/03/21/garry-mccarthy-announces-hes-running-for-mayor-of-chicago/'), ('Garry for Mayor, campaign website, as of March 30, 2018', 'No link'), ('Garry for Mayor, campaign website, as of April 13, 2018', 'https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4437508-Garry-for-Mayor-3-30.html'), ('Email interview, Bryan Biggs, McCarthy campaign spokesman, April 3-12, 2018', 'No link'), ('""Each Murder Costs $5 Million, Each Shooting $1 million, Top Cop Says,""  DNAinfo, May 13, 2013', 'https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/4437570-Garry-for-Mayor-4-13.html'), ('""Hidden in Plain Sight: What Cost-of-Crime Research Can Tell Us About Investing in Police,"" RAND, 2010', 'No link'), ('Email and phone interview, Dr. Ted Miller, Pacific Institute for Research and Evaluation, April 4-13, 2018', 'https://www.dnainfo.com/chicago/20130513/bridgeport/top-cop-each-murder-costs-city-5-million-every-shooting-costs-1-million/'), ('""The True Cost of Gun Violence: Our Methodology,"" Mother Jones, April 15, 2015', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/apr/17/garry-mccarthy/chicago-gun-violence-really-killing-citys-bottom-l/

Did Celine Dion say she hates this country? No.
","Canadian singer Celine Dion did not say she hates America, despite a hoax you might have seen online.

An April 11 headline falsely quoted Dion as saying, ""I Can’t Even Look At An American Flag Any More, I Hate This Country."" Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. We found no evidence that Dion said either of these things. The rumor originated on a clickbait website in September 2017, according to Snopes. The story doesn’t support the headline. Instead, it talks about how Dion turned down an offer to sing at President Donald Trump’s inauguration. In January 2017, news outlets such as TMZ reported that Dion passed up the opportunity, but not because she hates America. Dion was actually scheduled to perform at the Colosseum at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas on the day of the inauguration, which we were able to confirm with an archived version of her  2017 schedule. After a few paragraphs repeating the same information, the story cuts to a YouTube video with a thumbnail of Dion. The 59-second video shares the same title as the blog post, but instead of Dion speaking, it’s actually just a computer voiceover, saying, ""I can’t even look at an American flag anymore, I hate this country."" Right after the ""quote,"" however, the voice-over contradicts the previous statement. It says that Dion is one of the most talented vocalists that ""ever existed.""

No evidence of 250 million moon inhabitants. That’s made up
","A online hoax claims, entirely without evidence, that 250 million inhabitants currently live on, or inside, the moon. The headline, from a website called Mysterious Earth, states ""CIA Release Documents Of Moon, Moon Has More Than 250 Million Citizens."" But the article makes no reference to released CIA documents, and provides not a shred of proof to back up the claim that a civilization roughly the size of Pakistan’s population lives on the moon. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. The article opens with a mangled quote misattributed to theoretical physicist Albert Einstein: ""Contemplation without investigation is the height of ignorance."" (As the sleuths at metabunk.org point out, the real quote appears to trace back to 18th century British theologian William Paley, who criticized formulating contempt without investigation.) Next, the item suggests that the very fact that it’s conceivable that hundreds of millions of inhabitants live on the moon — no matter how improbable — gives credence to the argument that a substantial lunar civilization already exists. (This argument, which takes the logical form of ""X is possible, therefore X is true,"" is a logical fallacy known as an appeal to possibility.) Yet in the very next breath the author doubles back, acknowledging ""this may not be true."" The item then cycles through a host of fringe theories, including the Spaceship Moon hypothesis (also known as the Hollow Moon hypothesis). This idea, put forth in 1970 by two members of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, holds that the moon is actually a hollow spaceship built by aliens. This theory has been roundly debunked by planetary scientists. Dr. Renee Weber, who manages the Heliophysics and Planetary Science Division at NASA’s Marshall Space Flight Center, said in a 2011 interview that none of NASA’s findings support the Hollow Moon theory. Karen Masters, an associate professor in astronomy and astrophysics at the Institute of Cosmology and Gravitation at the University of Portsmouth in England, also addressed the fringe theory in a 2015 online forum hosted by Cornell University. ""The Moon is not hollow,"" Masters said. ""It is possible to tell this because when we have had things in orbit around the Moon, how they orbit in the Moon's gravity tells us about the mass of the Moon. We also know the size of the Moon so we can work out the density and see that it is not possible for the Moon to be hollow.""

No, Barack Obama did not announce bid for United Nations secretary-general
","A website calling itself USA NEWS uses outdated and unfounded information to falsely claim that former President Barack Obama has announced a bid to become the United Nations’ secretary-general.

The editorial acknowledges that the rumors ""might be just another imaginative fairy tale of the Arabian night. The Arab media is addicted to such tales. But Mr. Obama was once described by Bill Clinton as a fairy tale, too, and here he is, completing his second term, and Mr. Obama does not suffer excessive modesty.""

No, Fox News did not put up graphic showing it was the least trusted network
","Did Fox News accidentally put up a graphic showing it’s the least trusted network? That’s what bloggers claimed in a post that leaves out important context and details about the graphic. ""Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network,"" said boinboing.net in an April 9 post. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Bloggers focused on a Fox News segment in which Howard Kurtz, host of Media Buzz, talks with Republican strategist and pollster Frank Luntz about President Donald Trump, the media and public trust. ""When host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news, viewers got a look at the wrong poll – one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more, CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News,"" Boingboing.net’s post said. ""Not surprising but a knee-slapper nonetheless, the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most, at 48%, followed by MSNBC at 45%. Fox came in last place with a mere 30% of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy."" Boingboing.net said Kurtz asked then quickly asked for the graphic to be taken down. Kurtz did request that the graphic be taken down — but the graphic did not indicate Fox News was the least trusted network. In fact, the graphic, based on a Monmouth University poll, asked ""Who do you trust more?"" But individuals polled were asked who they trusted more as a source of information (CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, Fox News or Trump), or both equally. The Fox News graphic showed that 48 percent of people said they trusted CNN more, compared to 35 percent who trusted Trump more; 45 percent said they trusted MSNBC more, compared to 32 percent who trusted Trump more; 30 percent trusted Fox News more, compared to 20 percent who trusted Trump more. The question was not about the most trustworthy network and was not a direct comparison of CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News. The Washington Post on April 9 reported that Fox News pushed back on reports that its network was the least trusted among competitors. It said the Associated Press published a story headlined ""Fox News mistakenly posts graphic showing it lags in trust."" (AP’s new headline says ""Fox News host: Graphic posted at wrong point of show."") The newspaper also noted that CNN’s Chris Cuomo tweeted a RawStory.com post headlined, ""Watch Fox host Howard Kurtz panic after graphic shows Fox News is least trusted network."" RawStory.com added an updated to its story saying it included a response from Kurtz and that the headline had been revised for accuracy. It's new headline reads, "" ‘Take that down’: Howard Kurtz surprised after graphic pops up showing Fox News is least trusted network."" Boingboing.net also added an update at the top of its post on April 12. The amended post said:""UPDATE 4/12/2018: Yes, Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic, but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasn't actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network. Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump."" Kurtz did elaborate on the graphic after his show — not because it was confusing, but because he said the Associated Press ran a story ""that utterly distorts what happened."" ""The AP reported my request to take down the graphic and ended the story there, creating a false impression by not mentioning that I called for the very same graphic shortly afterward,"" Kurtz wrote in an April 9 Facebook post. ""This echoed partisan chatter online that I had somehow panicked or didn’t want to show the poll graphic, which is flatly contradicted by reality."" Kurtz wrote that the graphic was mistakenly posted early, while he was discussing fake news, but brought back later in the show. (AP ran a correction about that point.) Bloggers said, ""Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network."" The graphic was based on a Monmouth University poll that asked people who they trusted more CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, Fox News or Trump. It wasn’t a graphic for a direct question comparing the three networks. The Fox News graphic showed that 48 percent of people said they trusted CNN more, compared to 35 percent who trusted Trump more; 45 percent said they trusted MSNBC more, compared to 32 percent who trusted Trump more; 30 percent trusted Fox News more, compared to 20 percent who trusted Trump more.

An assistant circuit attorney asked the woman, ""Did you see what you believed to be a phone?"" She answered, ""… I haven’t talked about it because I don’t know if it’s because I’m remembering it through a dream or I – I’m not sure, but yes, I feel like I saw it after that happened, but I haven’t spoken about it because of that."" Jack Cashill, co-editor of the Sentinel, told PolitiFact that he didn’t have the full deposition and relied on excerpts in the court filing.

""It is for this reason I used the subjunctive in the headline ‘may have,’ "" he said, noting that other news outlets including the Daily Mail used a similar approach in headlines.

Greitens has seized on the dream portion of the woman’s statement, telling media that the case is ""a political witch hunt now based on the testimony of somebody who said under oath that they may be remembering this through a dream."" Other news reports state that that the woman’s testimony came during a deposition that lasted for several hours. The Associated Press wrote that ""the prosecutor in the case says the defense ‘cherry picked bits and pieces’ of her nine-hour deposition and the woman's attorney says the comment referred to one particular instance concerning the photo."" The Missouri House committee investigation into the allegations against Greitens also mentioned the dream comment, but stated in a footnote that the committee ""includes these quotes in the absence of a full transcript from the deposition."" The woman told the committee that during an encounter with Greitens, ""I can hear like a, like a cell phone – like a picture, and I can see a flash through the blindfold."" The committee concluded that the woman was a credible witness. Greitens did not testify before the House committee. St. Louis Circuit Judge Rex Burlison issued a gag order in the case which prohibits comments related to the deposition and requires the judge to sign off on certain court filings before they're made public. Without the deposition, we can’t fully evaluate the woman’s comments. The woman’s attorney, Scott Simpson, said in statement to media that the woman supports the release of the full transcript. Simpson said that Greitens ""has admitted to my client, on multiple occasions that he took her photograph without her consent, and threatened to release it if she ever told anyone about their relationship."" A headline by the Sentinel website said that ""Greitens accuser admits photo session may have been a ‘dream.’ "" News articles state that the woman made that comment during a lengthy deposition. Since we don’t have a transcript of the deposition, it is difficult to evaluate her comment but it appears to be cherry-picking from a deposition that lasted several hours.

Syrian Red Crescent did NOT deny chemical attack in Douma, Syria
","On April 7, reports emerged from Syria’s civil war that residents of the city of Douma east of Damascus were potential victims of chemical weapons. The reports have yet to be confirmed, but footage of women and children foaming at the mouth threaten to draw a military strike by Western forces. The California-based non-interventionist website Antiwar.com posted an article saying the Syrian Red Crescent, which is a member of the international Red Cross/Red Crescent federation, rejected the idea of a chemical attack. ""The Syrian Red Crescent issued a statement Monday dismissing the allegations of a weekend chemical weapon attack in the city of Douma,"" the April 9 article said. ""The statement insisted their medical personnel in the city had found no evidence any such attack took place."" PolitiFact contacted the Syrian Arab Red Crescent (the organization typically includes the Arab designation) to confirm the statement. ""We are not aware of such a declaration,"" said Rana Sidani Cassou in the Beirut office of the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies. ""Neither the Syrian Arab Red Crescent nor the International Federation are in a position to confirm or deny any attack."" In fact, during the April 7 attack, Syrian jets had targeted the Syrian Red Crescent hospital in Douma and the next day, the group tweeted that the Douma branch had shut down. When we contacted Eric Garris, director of Antiwar.com, the website retracted the article, and posted a new one with the headline ""Report of Syrian Red Crescent Statement on Alleged Douma Attack Incorrect."" Garris told PolitiFact that they based the original story on an article that appeared April 8 on the Russian-state sponsored news website Tass. That article said the Syrian Red Crescent had issued a statement. We can’t verify that. The Tass article quotes doctors who work with the Syrian Red Crescent talking about an attack that took place in January. Garris said his news editor believes Tass might have changed the article from the version he first saw. Garris said his group moved ahead with the story, even though he did not find confirmation on the Syrian Red Crescent website. ""I have no excuse for letting it slip through like this,"" Garris said. ""We should have been more diligent. There’s enough misinformation out there, and we don’t want to be a part of that."" The retraction said, ""In the future, we will not use foreign news sources as the sole source for important articles like this."" The Antiwar.com website said that the Syrian Red Crescent had issued a statement saying that they found no evidence of a chemical attack in Douma.

Jerry Brown says there’s “no massive wave of migrants pouring into California.” Is he right?
","Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown recently agreed to President Donald Trump’s request to deploy California National Guard troops to the U.S.-Mexico border, though with several caveats. Brown, for example, said state troops ""will not be enforcing federal immigration laws,"" but will instead support operations targeting transnational criminal gangs and human traffickers. The governor said he’ll accept federal money for 400 troops, some of which would be sent to the border. Trump made the request as part of his stated effort to ""seal up"" the border and prevent illegal crossings. ""I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law!"" the president tweeted on April 9, 2018. White House officials have called recent border crossing figures ""alarming."" But in a letter to the Trump administration two days later, Brown attempted to set the record straight about what he says is really happening along California’s border with Mexico. ""Here are the facts: there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California. Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California)."" With claims about border crossings boomeranging from Sacramento to Washington D.C., we decided to scrutinize the governor’s statement in a fact check.  In this Sept. 15, 2015, file photo, a farmer passes along a borer fence that divides his property, Tuesday, in Mission, Texas. (AP Photo/Eric Gay) Our research To support it, the governor’s spokesman cited U.S. Border Patrol figures for apprehensions across California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas. The data is from 1960 through 2017. For 2017, they show 303,916 arrests across the entire Southern border. The previous low was 263,991 in 1971, 46 years ago. So, Brown’s claim that apprehensions in 2017 were ""as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years"" is on the mark. He’s also right that 85 percent of these took place ""outside California."" About 68 percent of the arrests took place in Texas and New Mexico, while Arizona accounted for 17 percent and California about 15 percent, according to a review of the border patrol figures. ""He is absolutely correct,"" said Ev Meade, director of the Trans Border Institute at the University of San Diego. ""Even as we’re at an historic low borderwide, it’s particularly low in California. We’re not receiving large numbers of migrants. Those migrants who are coming are largely crossing the Rio Grande and are apprehended at border patrol stations in Texas."" Meade said the overall trend on the Southern border shows a dramatic decrease in apprehensions. ""In the year 2000, the border patrol apprehended 1.6 million people (borderwide). For 2017, it was down to 300,000. It’s a tiny fraction,"" he said. Just along California’s border, nearly 390,000 people were arrested in 2000. By 2017, that number had dropped to less than 45,000, border patrol figures show. SOURCE: Trans Border Institute, University of San Diego Wave of migrants?   While the governor’s numbers are right, do they prove the first part of his claim: ""There is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California?"" Given the context of the letter, Brown is clearly referring to migrants crossing into the state across the border with Mexico. But what about the other ways people enter the state? Joseph Hayes, a research associate at the Public Policy Institute of California, pointed out that border arrests aren’t necessarily the best metric to evaluate migration to California. Much of the nation’s and state’s undocumented population results from individuals overstaying visas. In a 2017 report, the Center For Migration Studies found that two-thirds of those who arrived in the United States in 2014 and later would be counted as undocumented were admitted on temporary visas ""and then overstayed their period of admission or otherwise violated the terms of their visas."" Still, Hayes said, the overall number of people living illegally in California has declined since before the Great Recession. The state was home to approximately 3 million undocumented residents in 2007, a figure that’s dropped to as low as 2.35 million, according to estimates reviewed by PPIC. The decline in the state’s undocumented population reinforces Brown’s contention there’s ""no massive wave of migrants pouring into California."" Historically, Meade added, thousands of seasonal migrant farmworkers have come to California through the border with Mexico. He said that seasonal migration has largely ""dried up"" in recent years and many undocumented farmworkers now stay in the state year-round, rather than crossing back into Mexico. ""International migration has become more difficult,"" he said, citing greater border enforcement. 2018 spike in crossings Brown cited figures from 2017. But what about the 200 percent spike in apprehensions borderwide in March 2018 compared with the same month a year ago, as cited this week by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen?   Meade, of the Trans Border Institute, said the 2018 increase should be considered in context. It follows the historically low number of 2017 arrests, which has been attributed, in part, to fewer people trying to illegally cross the border due to Trump’s election and hard-line immigration stance. Immigration experts have also cited the Obama administration’s aggressive deportation efforts and greater economic opportunities in Mexico for recent declines in border crossings. Meade also noted the 2018 increase took place during spring, the high-point of migration season. He said it doesn’t represent a long-term trend. Nor does it show California is experiencing a disproportionate share of the 2018 increase, he said. ""Unless this were to continue for months and months and months and break the seasonal pattern, I don’t think there’s any real way to claim (the early part of 2018) is a crisis."" Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown claimed in a recent letter to the Trump administration: ""there is no massive wave of migrants pouring into California. Overall immigrant apprehensions on the border last year were as low as they’ve been in nearly 50 years (and 85 percent of the apprehensions occurred outside of California)."" U.S. Border Patrol data show Brown got his arrest figures right. Researchers point out that illegal border crossings account for only one portion of the migrants that arrive in California. Others come to the state legally on visas which they later overstay. But given the context of Brown’s letter, it’s clear the governor was referring to the lack of a wave of migrants coming illegally across the Southern border. That part of the claim is also backed up by the border patrol data and two immigration experts. We rate Brown’s claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Do women get only 80 percent of the pay men do for the same job?
","On April 10 -- Equal Pay Day -- Sen. Tina Smith, D-Minn., tweeted out her support for an end to differential pay for men and women. Her tweet said, ""It’s completely unacceptable that, on average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job. And the #paygap is even greater for most women of color. #EqualPayDay"" It’s completely unacceptable that, on average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job. And the #paygap is even greater for most women of color. #EqualPayDay pic.twitter.com/ly69NwlqyJ But there’s a problem: The statistics showing that women earn 80 percent of what men earn are overall comparisons and do not specifically compare men and women occupying the same jobs. After we reached out to Smith’s office, she sent a new tweet to correct her earlier misstatement. Let’s take a closer look at this commonly cited statistic. The most recent official data on this point, published by the U.S. Census Bureau, showed that women earned 80.5 percent of what men did. That’s up by a couple percentage points in recent years. However, as we’ve written previously, this figure actually refers to the general disparity between what men and women earn, not comparing cases of apples to apples. The 80 percent figure does not adjust for such factors as the degrees and jobs women pursue, the time they take off to care for children, the number of hours they work, and the years of experience they’ve had. So while the 80 percent figure may be used to signify some facets of women’s challenges in the workplace -- such as disproportionate representation in fields that offer more flexible work schedules, even if that means earning less -- the statistic cannot be used to pinpoint pay discrimination between men and women doing the same work. Other studies have shown a significantly closer match for men and women holding the same jobs. For instance, a 2013 study by the American Association of University Women that evened out those factors found a 7 percent wage gap between men and women a year after graduating college. That’s still a disparity, but it’s only about one-third as big as the figure Smith cited in her tweet. (It’s also worth noting that the apples-to-apples pay differential varies depending on the job.) Smith did have a point that women of color tend to fare more poorly on pay comparisons than do white women. A 2014 report from the National Women’s Law Center concluded that black women made 60 cents to the dollar earned by a white man, and Hispanic women made 55 cents, according to the report. Asian-American women actually earn higher wages than black and Hispanic men and women, as well as white women, Pew Research has found. Still, Asian-American women lagged behind white males for annual earnings. A few hours after we contacted Smith’s office, they informed us that Smith had sent a new tweet correcting her previous one. In the new tweet, she removed the reference to ""the same job"" and continued: ""When I wrote about Equal Pay Day earlier this week, I said the 80 cents/$1 stat applies to men and women doing the same job. That last part—comparing particular job categories—wasn’t quite right. And I’m glad @PolitiFact reached out to me for clarification."" When I wrote about Equal Pay Day earlier this week, I said the 80 cents/$1 stat applies to men and women doing the same job. That last part—comparing particular job categories—wasn’t quite right. And I’m glad @PolitiFact reached out to me for clarification. In Smith’s initial tweet, she wrote, ""On average, American women only earn 80 cents for every dollar a man earns for doing the same job."" The official federal data shows that women earn 80 percent of what men earn, but that’s a collective average for all jobs, not a comparison of men and women holding identical jobs. For men and women holding the same job, there’s still a gap, but it’s substantially smaller. Our policy is to acknowledge and applaud after-the-fact corrections by speakers we check, but we still put the original comment to the Truth-O-Meter. So Smith’s initial remark rates Mostly False.","[('Tina Smith, tweet, April 10, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/SenTinaSmith/status/983772249168760832'), ('Tina Smith, tweet, April 12, 2018', 'No link'), ('U.S. Census Bureau, ""Income and Poverty in the United States: 2016,"" Sept. 12, 2017', 'https://twitter.com/SenTinaSmith/status/983772249168760832'), ('PolitiFact, ""Taking a closer look at Florida Democrat\'s claims about the gender pay gap,"" March 14, 2017', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/apr/13/tina-smith/do-women-get-only-80-percent-pay-men-do-same-job/

Did Luke Messer plot to steal the nomination from Donald Trump in 2016? Not really
","Three Republican candidates competing for a U.S. Senate seat to represent Indiana are trying to prove they are the closest allies to President Donald Trump, who in 2016 won Indiana by 19 percentage points. The race represents one of the GOP’s best chances to seize a Senate seat from Democrats in the midterm election. The seat is held by Democrat Joe Donnelly. In an ad released a month ahead of the Republican primary, on April 3, Senate hopeful and current U.S. Representative Todd Rokita said his opponents were faking their support for Trump. Rokita described Mike Braun as a lifelong Democrat and fellow U.S. Rep. Luke Messer as an anti-Trump conspirator. ""And Luke Messer? He plotted with the Never-Trumpers to steal the nomination from President Trump,"" Rokita said in the ad. ""You’ve got to be kidding me."" We wondered whether Messer indeed plotted to steal the nomination from Trump. That’s an exaggeration. Rokita’s staff explained they were not accusing Messer of formally organizing with politicians and PACs opposed to a Trump presidency, but of pushing rhetoric harmful to Trump’s chances of clinching the Republican nomination and winning the general election. Nathan Brand, Rokita’s spokesman, produced an April 19, 2016, article from The Hill as evidence of Messer’s ""plotting"" prior to the Republican National Convention. The story was about an internal split in the Republican Party regarding a potential rule change to allow a ""white knight"" candidate to claim the nomination if none of the official candidates mustered a simple majority of delegates. Messer named Mitt Romney and former Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels as possible white knight candidates. ""My belief is it’s all about fairness,"" Messer is quoted as saying. ""Ultimately, the convention has to be perceived to be fair."" Messer’s campaign argued the names were a response to a hypothetical situation and had no substance given that Messer was not a delegate at the convention and would thus be unable to influence its outcome. Rokita was. (Trump won all of Indiana’s delegates.) Rokita’s campaign countered that the white knight possibility was one tactic floated by the Never Trump movement, and playing ball with the hypothetical implied Messer’s approval. Robert Dion, a political science professor at the University of Evansville, Ind., downplayed the significance of a brokered convention, which has not happened since the 1950s. He saw Rokita’s attack as hyperbole. ""To the degree that there was some hypothetical prospect that someone was planning to deny Donald Trump the nomination, there is nothing in this article to suggest that Rep. Messer was directly involved in advancing this idea,"" Dion said. Rokita’s campaign also compiled a series of clips in which Messer criticized Trump’s campaign rhetoric. In the clips, Messer said Trump did not act presidential or ""like an adult"" and repeatedly wondered whether Trump has ""a personal tic where he can’t control what he says."" ""In my opinion when you look at Donald Trump's life pattern, you have not seen a life pattern of racism, but you have seen a series of comments that could fairly be called race baiting over the course of the last multiple months,"" Messer said in a June 9, 2016, C-SPAN interview. ""I’ve spoken out against it, I think it’s wrong, and it needs to stop."" Messer expressed worry that Trump’s rhetoric would cost him the election. But a closer look at the full interviews revealed that while Trump was not his first choice, he would still support Trump over Clinton. ""If he will focus on jobs, focus on the record of deceit from the Clintons over their decades of public service, he can win the election,"" Messer said. ""It is important he does. I do not want to see a President Clinton. That would be bad for America."" Messer’s remarks don’t suggest plotting, Dion said. ""The video links merely suggest that he was sometimes uncomfortable with the tone of some of then-candidate Trump’s remarks,"" Dion said. ""If that is the criterion for being a Never-Trumper, then that would include an enormous segment of the American population, including Republicans. It is clear all along that he is a loyal Republican who plans to vote for Trump and who wants his party to succeed."" Rokita’s campaign said Messer could have communicated these suggestions directly to the Trump campaign. By taking them to national television instead, he undermined Trump’s credibility among voters. The Messer campaign pointed to a double standard: In a February 2016 interview with WXIN TV, Rokita called Trump ""vulgar, if not profane,"" when comparing Marco Rubio with Trump. ""At some point you have to be presidential,"" Rokita said. ""People expect that, and you see that in Marco Rubio."" Like Messer, Rokita acknowledged he would support Trump if he became the nominee. Rokita did not seem particularly psyched about Trump in a May 2016 radio interview, either. He didn’t deny an interviewer’s claim that he would ""obviously be anti-Trump"" during the convention, called Trump’s comments on manufacturing ""manipulative,"" and responded he wasn’t worried about the down-ballot ticket effect of a Trump supporter in the race for his current congressional seat, implying he was not the pro-Trump candidate. Tony Samuel, who was vice-chairman of the Indiana Trump campaign and has endorsed Rokita, said Rokita ultimately came through for the Trump campaign whereas Messer did not. While Messer spoke against Trump’s rhetoric on television, Samuel explained, Rokita made several media appearances at the campaign’s behest praising, for example, Trump’s debate performance. After analyzing public statements from the congressmen leading up to the Republican National Convention, FiveThirtyEight classified both as ""reluctant endorsers"" of Trump, third in a seven-category scale. FiveThirtyEight rated both Messer’s and Rokita’s support for the Trump agenda in the 90th percentile. Other than a few conflicting budget votes, Rokita and Messer have been virtually identical on the policy front, according to Indiana political columnist Brian Howey. Neither Trump nor Pence have endorsed either candidate. The state campaign chairman, Rex Early, endorsed Rokita, and the American Economic Freedom Alliance, a group linked to Marty Obst, senior political adviser to Vice President Mike Pence, is running pro-Messer ads. Rokita said Messer ""plotted with the Never-Trumpers to steal the nomination from President Trump."" Rokita’s campaign and supporters argued that Messer’s engagement with questions about a white knight candidate and criticism of Trump’s rhetoric on national television expressed an implicit support of the anti-Trump movement. But we found no indication that Messer actively plotted to prevent Trump from winning the Republican nomination or election. He maintained reluctant support for Trump throughout the 2016 campaign.

Is New York's tax burden 'among the highest' in the nation?
","A Republican who wants to unseat Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo this year says New York state residents face one of the highest tax burdens in the country. Dutchess County Executive Marcus Molinaro said Cuomo hasn’t done enough to lower taxes during his first two terms as governor. ""I can imagine he wants to talk about anything but his last seven years in office and certainly the fact that we have among the highest tax burdens of any state in the nation,"" Molinaro said to reporters in Albany. Molinaro wants to cut property taxes by reducing state mandated spending for counties, like Medicaid. The state would absorb that spending without raising taxes by cutting costs elsewhere. Cuomo has limited rising property taxes by capping how much local governments can raise them. PolitiFact New York rated as Mostly True the governor's claim that he's cut income taxes to the lowest rates in 70 years for middle-class New York state earners. So where New York state ranks in the nation for tax burden could change in coming years. But is Molinaro right? Do New York state residents still have among the highest tax burdens in the country now? Tax burden data To support the claim, a Molinaro spokesperson pointed to a New York Post article that relied on data and analysis from the right-leaning Tax Foundation. The group found the state's residents spent, on average, 12.7 percent of their income on state and local taxes, ""the highest burden in the nation."" But there's a caveat: The data's from 2012. More recent analysis from the Tax Foundation shows New York state ranked second in the nation for the amount of all state and local taxes collected per capita -- $8,722 -- in 2016. That includes property, income, sales and corporate taxes among others. Only North Dakota had a higher amount. For state and local income taxes alone, New York state ranked highest in the nation for the amount collected per capita -- $2,789 -- in 2015, according to the latest data from the Tax Foundation. For property taxes, New York state ranked fourth in the nation for the amount collected per capita -- $2,697 -- in 2015. The state has some of the highest local property taxes in the country. ""Looking at all of the available metrics, some of this is of course driven by New York being a relatively high-income state,"" said John Buhl, a spokesperson for the Tax Foundation. ""Nevertheless, by most measures, New York is one of the highest taxed states in the country."" Other things to consider Per capita rates look at the total amount of tax revenue collected in a state divided by that state’s population. That doesn’t consider the number of wealthy earners and high-value homes in New York state, which inflate the revenue collected by state and local governments. New York state has the third-highest number of millionaires in the country, and those earners are taxed at a higher rate than in most states. The state also has the second-highest number of homes worth more than $2 million, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. New York state ranks 14th in property taxes as a share of the state’s average home value. New York state ""does have a lot of very wealthy people, companies and buildings,"" said Richard Auxier, a research associate at the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan tax research organization. ""All that wealth contributes to New York’s high tax revenue, even before we discuss tax rates and the tax liability of residents."" Auxier co-authored a report that showed New York state relied more on property and income tax revenue than an average state in 2012. New York state relied on property taxes more than most states in particular. But the state also provides generous tax credits to low- and middle-income families. Our ruling Molinaro said New York state has ""among the highest tax burdens of any state in the nation."" The Tax Foundation analysis shows New York state ranks among the highest for per capita collections of income and property taxes. Since Cuomo took office in January 2011, New York state has cut income tax rates and capped property tax increases. The changes could affect future rankings. But Molinaro’s claim is accurate. The tax burden for the state's residents remains among the highest in the nation. We rate it True.","[('Email conversation with David Catalfamo, political spokesperson for Molinaro', 'https://nypost.com/2018/02/20/new-york-taxpayers-have-highest-burden-in-nation/'), ('""New York taxpayers have highest burden in nation,"" New York Post, Feb. 20, 2018', 'No link'), ('Email conversation with John Buhl, spokesperson for the Tax Foundation', 'https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/78431/2000646-assessing-fiscal-capacities-of-states-a-representative-revenue-system-representative-expenditure-system-approach-fiscal-year-2012_1.pdf'), ('Email interview with Richard Auxier, research associate at the Tax Policy Center', 'No link'), ('""Assessing Fiscal Capacities of States,"" Urban Institute, March 2016', 'http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/your-states-tax-system-punching-above-or-below-its-weight'), ('""Is your state’s tax system punching above or below its weight?""

Recycled hoax falsely claim CIA agent admitted killing actress Marilyn Monroe
","An online hoax claiming a CIA agent admitted committing a series of assassinations including Hollywood star Marilyn Monroe has resurfaced. ""Dying 78 year old CIA agent admits to killing Marilyn Monroe"" read the headline on Science Vibe, a website that claims to share stories from scientific breakthroughs to the seemingly impossible. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat misinformation. There are many things wrong with the post. First, the supposed ex-CIA officer Normand Hodges is made up. The photo of ""Hodges"" is actually a man named Michael Tyrrell taken from a 2013 Guardian article about prisoners in hospitals. The Science Vibe article presents the reasoning behind why Marilyn Monroe became a security threat is because she had supposedly slept with Cuban revolutionary Fidel Castro making her susceptible to exposing strategic information to communists. While there are conspiracy theories surrounding the relationships of Monroe and the truth behind her death ruled by police as a probable suicide, there is no evidence that she was murdered in part of a cover-up. When we tried to search for the quotes attributed to Hodges, we found no results or credible sources for them. We also found this story circulated by several other hoax sites. We rate this Pants on Fire.","[('Science Vibe, ""Dying 78 year old CIA agent admits to killing Marilyn Monroe"", April 11, 2018', 'http://sciencevibe.com/2018/04/11/dying-78-year-old-cia-agent-admits-to-killing-marilyn-monroe/'), ('The Guardian, Dying prisoners routinely chained to hospital beds, Nov. 8, 2013', 'No link'), ('SBS News, 4 conspiracy theories about the death of Marilyn Monroe, July 28, 2017', 'https://www.theguardian.com/society/2013/nov/08/dying-prisoners-chained-hospital-beds'), ('History.com 1962: Marilyn Monroe is found dead', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/apr/12/science-vibe/recycled-hoax-falsely-claim-cia-agent-admitted-kil/

Texan says U.S. Capitol statues of Stephen F. Austin, Sam Houston only ones holding a gun or sword
","A fundraising email staked a claim to uniqueness about Texans in the U.S. Capitol that made us wonder. Jonathan Saenz, who heads Texas Values, a group that says it’s dedicated to faith, family and freedom, wrote March 28, 2018, that during a recent walk through the U.S. Capitol, ""I gazed up at the carvings and paintings that tell America’s glorious story… smiling that Stephen F. Austin’s and Sam Houston’s statues were the only ones holding a rifle or a sword. I was reminded about the truth of all that’s exceptional about America and Texas."" That kind of historical trivia seems tailor-made for our Texas Truth-O-Meter. Tourists visiting Washington, D.C., learn that the Capitol houses 100 statues, two donated by each state. According to the Architect of the Capitol, which is the steward of the landmark buildings and grounds of Capitol Hill, such statues were confined to the building’s National Statuary Hall until Congress in 1933 reacted to overcrowding--at the time, 65 statues were wedged three-deep into the hall--by authorizing the statues to be spread throughout the building, which extends to the Capitol Visitor Center. We scrolled online through the architect office’s posted photos of the 100 statues. Could it be that only Austin and Houston were carved holding a gun or sword? Austin’s statue has a long gun front and center, it looked to us, while Houston’s statue just barely appeared to have a sword to its left rear side. But our click-through of photos of the Capitol statues showed that Houston wasn’t the only one holding a sword. (A fair number of others, we saw, hold books.) List of statues holding weapons When we sought expert help, a curator from the Capitol architect’s office, Jennifer Blancato, emailed us a list of Capitol statues holding weapons — with a notation that the Austin statue alone holds a firearm, which she listed as a rifle. Blancato listed 12 Capitol statues--including the one of Houston--of men holding swords. Similarly, William C. diGiacomantonio, chief historian of the U.S. Capitol Historical Society, which was chartered by Congress in the 1960s to educate the public on the Capitol’s history and heritage, responded by email that the Capitol statue of Austin is the only one brandishing a musket or rifle while, he said, many Capitol statues hold swords. Blancato specified as the sword-holding statues: Houston; Gen. Joseph Wheeler of Alabama; Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith of Florida; Gen. James Shield of Illinois; John Stark of New Hampshire; Philip Kearney of New Jersey; John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg of Pennsylvania; Nathanael Greene of  Rhode Island; John Sevier of Tennessee; Ethan Allen of Vermont; Robert E. Lee of Virginia; and Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. (Blancato otherwise said the statues of King Kamehameha I of Hawaii and Chief Washakie of Wyoming hold spears.) We shared Blancato’s break-out with Saenz who said in an emailed statement that he based his claim about the Texas statues on what he noticed while at the Capitol, perhaps ""because my focus is always primarily on Texas."" Our ruling Saenz said the Capitol statues of Austin and Houston are ""the only ones holding a rifle or a sword."" This proud Texan's claim has an element of truth in that Austin’s rifle-bearing statue alone holds a rifle.  However, a dozen statues donated by states, including the one of Houston, hold swords. We rate this statement Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
