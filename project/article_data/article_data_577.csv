Charlie Crist touts Florida's improvements in education rankings
","Gov. Charlie Crist says Florida has a good story to tell when it comes to K-12 education. His evidence? State-by-state rankings from a reputable education publication. ""When I came in three years ago, according to  Education Weekly  , a well-respected national publication, it said that out of the 50 states Florida was ranked 31st. Thirty-first in K-12 education,"" Crist told members of the Pinellas Republican Executive Committee on Dec. 14, 2009. ""Last year my friends, we went from 31st to 14. And this year, the top 10 in America. ""These aren't my statistics. They're not from our Department of Education. They're from objective observers who gave us this ranking."" Crist means  Education Week  , not Weekly, but that's not really important. What is, is his claim that Florida's education ranking has improved dramatically from 2007 to 2009. Does Crist have the rankings right? Each January,  Education Week  produces a detailed state-by-state report that measures and compares states on a number of education benchmarks. It ranks states based on accountability, K-12 achievement, school finances and other categories. The report, which is published online as well as in print, then produces an overall ranking for each state, both as a letter and a number between 1 and 100. We'll start with the most recent rankings and work backward. In  Education Week  's January 2009 report titled ""Portraits of a Population,"" Florida received an overall letter score of B- or a number score of 79.6. As Crist suggests, that score put Florida in a tie for 10th when compared to the other 49 states and the District of Columbia. Check. We then turned to the 2008 report called ""Tapping Into Teaching."" There, Florida scored a C+ or 79.2 and ranked 14th in the country. Another check. Finally, we looked at the 2007 report ""From Cradle to Career."" The 2007 report doesn't have the same overall ranking that is available for the 2008 and 2009 studies, but there is a ranking called the Chance For Success Index. The Chance For Success Index, its authors say, was designed to measure the odds of success for a child who grows up in a particular state when compared to other states. Indicators include family income, a parent's education and employment, high school graduation rates, adult employment status, and state annual income figures. On that index, as Crist says, Florida ranked 31st nationwide. That year, Florida also ranked 31st in the publication's K-12 Achievement Index, which focuses explicitly on in-school learning. Three reports, three years, three rankings – 31, 14, 10. C-h-e-c… If only it were that simple. Turns out, one of these numbers is not like the others. Christopher B. Swanson, director of the Editorial Projects in Education Research Center, the not-for-profit organization that publishes  Education Week,  says Crist is referring to overall rankings for 2008 and 2009. But there is no overall ranking for 2007. That's because the publication never produced one, Swanson says. What was graded and ranked in 2007 are two specific categories, Chance For Success and K-12 Achievement. Those categories were then folded into the overall calculations and rankings for later years, Swanson said. Put another way, the 2007 rankings measured A and B, while the 2008 and 2009 numbers measured A, B, C, D, and so on. Crist shoehorned the numbers together. ""We generally advise against making strong statements about year-to-year comparisons because our framework/indicators generally changes at least a little bit,"" Swanson said. ""This would particularly be true in the past couple years since we have made some major revisions to our research and grading framework."" But for argument's sake, let's compare years anyway. While it did not publish overall rankings each year,  Education Week  did publish state rankings for its Chance For Success and K-12 Achievement indexes in 2007, 2008 and 2009. Florida's Chance For Success ranking -- which takes into account state graduation rates, employment opportunities and income potential -- fell from 31, to 32, to 33 (not so good). The state's K-12 Achievement ranking -- which measures only in-school learning -- climbed from 31 in 2007 to 7 in 2008 and 7 again 2009 (very good). We understand this can be confusing. The  St. Petersburg Times  made the same general assumption Crist did in a report Jan. 7, 2009. In a story called ""Schools gain national respect,"" the  Times  used  Education Week  rankings to say how Florida had jumped from 31 to 14 to 10. Which brings us back to Crist's original statement. Crist is right that  Education Week  ranked Florida 31st in 2007, 14th in 2008 and 10th in 2009. But they're simply not comparable rankings. The publication didn't make an overall ranking in 2007, and says it has adjusted the ratings formula slightly each year. A cursory review would have revealed as much. And even if he missed it, the  Orlando Sentinel  put the rankings very much in doubt back in September. But there's plenty of good news to be found in the  Education Week  rankings. Florida's K-12 achievement ranks 7th in the country, and the state ranks 10th overall. That's certainly worth cheering and, we assume, part of the point Crist was trying to make to begin with. On the whole, he gets a Half True.",/factchecks/2009/dec/21/charlie-crist/charlie-crist-touts-floridas-improvements-educatio/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama said health care reform will reduce the cost of health care
","
After meeting with Senate Democrats on Dec. 15, President Barack Obama made a number of claims about what the health care bill would achieve if passed.
 
""We agree on reforms that will finally reduce the costs of health care,"" Obama said. ""Families will save on their premiums; businesses that will see their costs rise if we do nothing will save money now and in the future.  This plan will strengthen Medicare and extend the life of that program.  And because it gets rid of the waste and inefficiencies in our health care system, this will be the largest deficit reduction plan in over a decade.


""Now, I just want to repeat this because there's so much misinformation about the cost issue here.  You talk to every health care economist out there and they will tell you that whatever ideas are -- whatever ideas exist in terms of bending the cost curve and starting to reduce costs for families, businesses, and government, those elements are in this bill.""
 
Obama's comments came on the heels of a report from Richard S. Foster, the chief actuary for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) -- a nonpolitical civil service employee -- that concluded various provisions of the Senate bill ""would have a significant downward impact on future health care cost growth rates."" However, Foster continued, those effects would be outweighed by the increased cost associated with expanding health insurance coverage to another 33 million Americans. Specifically, the report estimates that the total national health expenditures under the Senate bill would increase by an total of $234 billion (0.7 percent) between 2010 and 2019.
 
Curiously, both Republicans and Democrats hailed the report as a victory for their side.
 
Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus, D-Mont., said the report ""shows that health reform will ensure both the federal government and the American people spend less on health care than if this bill doesn't pass, helping get a hold of America's debt and keep more money in people's pockets. This report is yet another clear indicator that we have to act - and act now.""
 
Meanwhile, Republican Sen. Charles E. Grassley said the Foster report showed that the Senate bill ""doesn't do anything to reduce the unsustainable growth in health care spending and in fact would make health care costs grow more rapidly.""
 
Confused yet? We decided to wade in and sort some of this out.
 
First, we need to acknowledge that when it comes to characterizing the ""costs of health care,"" there are several ways to look at it.
 
The first is how much people would pay in health insurance premiums. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO)

studied

the health care bill proposed by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., and concluded that if passed, most people would see a very modest decrease in premiums by 2016 (compared to what they would pay under the current system). How modest? Best-case scenario - for those in group plans with large companies -  about 3 percent better. For a small percentage of people (less than 8 percent of the insured) who would buy insurance on the individual market, and who wouldn't be eligible for federal subsidies, they might actually pay 10 to 13 percent more, though with new federal minimum standards, they'd also be getting more insurance coverage as well.
 
The second way to look at cost is its effect on the national deficit. And here again, the CBO has weighed in on the Reid plan. The

CBO concluded

that while the plan would be very expensive, the bill is also more than paid for with new taxes and plans to reduce health care spending over time. The net effect, according to the CBO, is that over 10 years, the plan would end up reducing the national deficit by $130 billion.
 
Which brings us to a third way to look at cost, whether the plan would lower the rate of health care inflation over the long term. Republicans are correct when they say that based on the CMS report, health care spending would increase by $234 billion over the next 10 years.
 
But remember, that's with a plan that is estimated to cover an additional 33 million people. So spending would increase 0.7 percent while adding coverage to roughly 10 percent of the population. In his report, Foster said numerous studies have demonstrated that people with health insurance use more health services than people without insurance.
 
So we'll be spending more over the next 10 years, even more than if we didn't pass the bill, according to the CMS report. But let's talk a minute about the ""rate of growth"" of health care spending. That's what Obama is talking about when he says he wants to ""bend the cost curve."" According to the projections in the CMS report, the rate of growth in national health care expenditures will spike a bit in the middle years of the health reform plan. That's when the provisions that result in 33 million more people getting health insurance will kick in. But in the later years of the 10-year projections, the rate of growth rises slower than under current law (albeit only slightly: in 2019, for example, it's the difference between rising at a clip of 6.9 percent under the proposed plan as opposed to 7.2 percent under current law).
 
So when Obama says reforms will lower the cost of health care, what he means is that they will eventually slow the rate of growth of health care expenses.
 
This can be pretty confusing stuff. And we think both sides in the debate are guilty of oversimplifying to score political points.
 
It's also worth noting that while the CMS is a legitimate nonpartisan source, there's lots of difference of opinion among respected economists about how various cost-cutting proposals in the plan will shake out. In other words, these projections are all highly speculative.
 
""There's a tremendous amount of uncertainty about whether what's in the bill will be enough to lower health care inflation,"" said Josh Gordon, policy director for the Concord Coalition, a group that advocates fiscal responsibility. ""No one knows for sure.""
 
All of the cost estimates being proffered are ""extraordinarily treacherous,"" because many of the changes being considered are unprecedented in history at this scale, said Henry Aaron, health policy scholar at the Brookings Institution.
 
Still, he said, the bill contains many of the devices that economists say

could

help to slow the growth of health care spending over time.
 
So when Obama says the plan would cut the cost of health care, it's not a simple answer. If he's talking about cutting people's premiums, the president is backed up by the CBO. According to the CBO, some people would pay more, but on average, most people -- people in employer plans -- would see very modest reductions in premiums compared to what they'd be expected to pay if nothing changes. If he's talking about the deficit, again, he's got support. The CBO estimates the plan would slightly reduce the deficit.
 
But when it comes to cutting health care expenditures, it's a little trickier. According to CMS, spending is expected to rise slightly (0.7 percent), due to adding some 33 million more people to the insured ranks. Obama can make a case that in the later years of the 10-year projection, the rate of growth for health care expenditures would be somewhat slowed. But in attempting to simpify the issue, saying that the plan would reduce the cost of health care,  we think Obama sacrifices some accuracy.
 
And so we rate his statement Half True.

"['National', 'History', 'Karl Rove']","
Rove says Obama's approval ratings after a year are worst of any president
","It's no secret that President Barack Obama has had a rough first year in office. His approval ratings in the major polls hover just below 50 percent -- a decline from earlier levels that has cheered Republicans and conservative commentators.

In a Dec. 16, 2009,  Wall Street Journal  column, Karl Rove -- the mastermind of George W. Bush's two election victories -- riffed off the grade of a ""solid B+"" that Obama gave himself in a Dec. 13 interview with Oprah Winfrey.

In a column headlined, ""The President Is No B+,"" Rove wrote that ""Barack Obama has won a place in history with the worst ratings of any president at the end of his first year: 49 percent approve and 46 percent disapprove of his job performance in the latest USA Today/Gallup Poll.""

We'll begin by clarifying a few points.

First, we should note that Rove was guilty of rhetorical excess when he said that Obama's numbers are the worst of ""any president"" at this point. Gallup's historical data -- the longest-running of the major polling firms -- dates back to Harry Truman, who was the first president whose entire tenure was polled in a fashion that modern experts would consider scientific. So Rove should have argued that Obama's numbers were the worst of any post-World War II president at this point in his term.

Second, Rove misspoke when he referred to measuring Obama's ratings at the end of his first year. By definition, those numbers won't be available until late January. But in assessing his statement, we've sidestepped that problem by asking Gallup to provide us the approval ratings for December of the first year in office of the postwar presidents, so that the ratings for each can be compared more directly with the figures we have for Obama.

Third, not all postwar presidents came to office equally. Dwight Eisenhower, John Kennedy, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Ronald Reagan, both Bushes and Bill Clinton were all elected, so their presidencies all started at the usual time of the year. By contrast, Truman, Lyndon Johnson and Gerald Ford assumed office after the death or resignation of their predecessor. Johnson's approval ratings roughly a year after taking office were around 70 percent, while Truman and Ford were both around 40 percent at that point in their tenure -- a level lower than Obama's today. But because the comparison isn't exact, independent analysts advised us to exclude Truman, Johnson and Ford from our analysis.

So, here are Gallup's December approval and disapproval ratings for all elected presidents since World War II. (For Clinton and George W. Bush, Gallup polled on presidential approval twice a month rather than once a month as previously, so the numbers below reflect an average of the two December scores for those presidents.)

•  Eisenhower, 69-22
•  Kennedy, 77-11
•  Nixon, 59-23
•  Carter, 57-27
•  Reagan, 49-41
•  George H.W. Bush, 71-20
•  Clinton, 53-39
•  George W. Bush, 86-11
•  Obama, 49-46

Compared to these predecessors, Obama's numbers are indeed the weakest -- but he's tied with Reagan in that unflattering achievement.

The similarities between the approval-rating paths of Obama and Reagan are actually quite striking, wrote Charles Franklin, a University of Wisconsin political scientist, in a recent post at the Web site Pollster.com. ""Both replaced deeply unpopular predecessors,"" Franklin wrote. ""Both enjoyed significant gains for their party in both houses of Congress. Both faced 'worst since the Depression' economic circumstances. And each in his own very different ways attempted to reshape government in the early months in office.""

It's worth adding a few words of caution about this kind of comparison. Ratings after one year don't necessarily correlate with ratings throughout one's term. For instance, in December 2001, George W. Bush's 86 percent approval rating was largely due to a wave of support after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Bush wound up his second term in the low 30s.

Still, if you're making the comparison -- and political observers have been doing precisely these sorts of comparisons for years -- Rove's statement holds up fairly well. Yes, Rove spoke too loosely when he said that Obama's numbers were the worst of any president's, and he failed to mention equally bad ratings for Reagan, a conservative icon whose politics were more in tune with Rove's than Obama. But with the exception of Reagan, every other elected president had clearly higher approval ratings at this point in his tenure than Obama has. So we rate Rove's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2009/dec/17/karl-rove/rove-says-obamas-approval-ratings-after-year-are-w/

Harkin repeats claim that 14,000 people lose health insurance daily
","
During a Senate floor speech on Dec. 13, 2009, Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, repeated a talking point that Democrats -- including President Barack Obama -- have cited frequently as evidence that the nation needs to pass a major health care reform bill.


""Today and every day,"" Harkin said, ""an estimated 14,000 Americans will lose their health insurance coverage.""


In July, PolitiFact

rated

a virtually identical statement by Obama as Mostly True. But because we based that evaluation on unemployment numbers that were current at the time -- and because Democrats have continued to repeat the statistic, including four lawmakers who made floor speeches on Nov. 7, 2009, the day the House passed its version of the health care bill -- we decided the talking point was due for a checkup.


Before we look at the statement's validity today, let's recap how the statistic emerged in the first place.


In July, the White House told us the number came from a report published by the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. A chart in the report was headlined, “14,000 People Became Uninsured Every Day in December and January.” This claim was, in turn, based on a model developed by Urban Institute health care scholar John Holahan.

 

Holahan was the co-author, with A. Bowen Garrett, of the January 2009 study, “Rising Unemployment, Medicaid and the Uninsured,” published by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured. That study provided the underpinning for the Center for American Progress report by estimating how many people can expect to lose their insurance, and not quickly get new coverage, when the national unemployment rate goes up. Essentially, what Holahan did is set up a model to measure the number of Americans who would lose their insurance when the unemployment rate rises from point A to point B.

 

Holahan and his co-author, using a baseline of 4.6 percent unemployment in 2007, calculated that 2.6 million people would lose coverage if the unemployment rate climbed to 7 percent; 3.7 million if it went to to 8 percent; 4.8 million at 9 percent; and 5.8 million at 10 percent.  The estimates took into account people who lost their jobs but then switched to a spouse’s plan or extended their coverage through COBRA, the federal law that guarantees people who lose their job can still get continued health coverage.

 

Applying Holahan's calculations to the actual rise in unemployment from November 2008 to June 2009, we found that the number was right around the 14,000 people per month that Obama cited. We checked with health care experts, and they, too, agreed that the 14,000 number was just about right.


But now, five months later, the unemployment situation has changed. We decided to run the numbers for two scenarios, one that started well before the period we had checked in July, and one that started later.



•


Health insurance lost since the start of the recession

. The National Bureau of Economic Research is the official arbiter of when recessions begin and end, and it has declared the start of the current recession as December 2007. So for our first scenario, we looked at figures from December 2007 to November 2009, the last month for which we have unemployment statistics.


During that two-year period, unemployment rose from 4.9 percent to 10 percent. In his paper, Holahan had said that a rise from 4.6 percent to 10 percent would leave 5.8 million people without insurance, so the slightly smaller rise in the actual unemployment figures should translate into about 5.5 million people losing insurance over that period. When you divide 5.5 million by 731 days, you get 7,524 people losing insurance per day -- only about half the amount regularly cited by Democrats.



•


Health insurance lost during the Obama presidency

. If you take the period since Obama has been in office (and you count January 2009, even though he was only president for part of that month), the unemployment rate has risen from 7.6 percent to 10 percent.


If you estimate the data based on Holahan's model, that would amount to 2.6 million jobs lost over 11 months. Dividing 2.6 million by 334 days, you get 7,784 people losing insurance every day -- a number very close to what we found for the recession as a whole, and, once again, only about half of what Democrats have been saying all these months.


Estimates under the model ""are very sensitive to the timeframe used,"" Holahan told PolitiFact. The way the model works, it requires monthly updating to make sure the talking point stays accurate. And we'll even accept a portion of the blame for validating the claim in July without updating it until now. When we made our initial assessment in July, we happened to look at a period of especially rapid job losses. That makes a difference because, under this model, the more the unemployment rate rises in a short period of time, the more Americans lose their insurance on a daily basis. As the rate of job losses has declined since July, the daily rate of Americans losing insurance has declined as well.


If the number is now roughly 8,000 -- a number that's still nothing to sneeze at -- then Democrats should be saying it's roughly 8,000. So we rate Harkin's statement False.

Obama says Congressional Budget Office found the economic stimulus has created up to 1.6 million jobs
","The number of jobs created by the massive and controversial economic stimulus package championed by President Barack Obama has been the subject of intense partisan debate for months. Obama and other administration officials have repeatedly cited numbers from the stimulus Web site, recovery.org, suggesting the stimulus has saved or created hundreds of thousands of jobs and has slowed rising unemployment rates. Many Republicans counter that rising unemployment rates suggest the stimulus hasn't worked, and that Democrats' statistics on job creation have been greatly exaggerated. So it was with some anticipation that both sides awaited a report from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which at the end of November weighed in with its analysis on the number of jobs the stimulus has saved or created. The agency calculates how much bills in Congress will cost the government, and political leaders on both sides of the aisle regularly turn to the CBO as the definitive source for budget projections. Obama apparently liked what he saw in the CBO report on the effect of the stimulus, as he has cited it frequently since. In a Dec. 4 speech on the economy in Allentown, Pa., Obama referenced the CBO figures when he said, ""And we passed the Recovery Act, which created or saved up to 1.6 million jobs, stopped our freefall, lifted our economy to the point where it’s growing for the first time in more than a year."" Obama was more clear in his reference in a speech on job creation at the Brookings Institution on Dec. 8: ""Finally, we're no longer seeing the severe deterioration in the job market that we once were. In fact, we learned on Friday that the unemployment rate fell slightly last month. This is welcome news, and news made possible in part by the up to 1.6 million jobs that the Recovery Act has already created and saved according to the Congressional Budget Office."" The next day at the White House, the president cited the CBO report again, saying, ""We've created or saved up to 1.6 million jobs, according to the CBO -- the Congressional Budget Office -- through the Recovery Act. Our economy is growing again. "" So without further ado ... the CBO report. ""CBO estimates that in the third quarter of calendar year 2009, an additional 600,000 to 1.6 million people were employed in the United States ... than would have been the case in the absence of (the economic stimulus),"" the report states. That's quite a large range, and the report acknowledges as much. ""Those ranges are intended to reflect the uncertainty of such estimates and to encompass most economists’ views on the effects of fiscal stimulus,"" the report states. The White House's stimulus Web site, recovery.org, reported a total of 640,000 jobs saved or created through September. But the CBO report says that tally has a number of shortcomings, some of which could greatly shift the total up or down. First, ""It is impossible to determine how many of the reported jobs would have existed in the absence of the stimulus package."" Second, the reports on the recovery Web site measure only the jobs created by the employers who received stimulus funds directly or by their immediate subcontractor. They do not include the jobs to lower-level subcontractors. And it doesn't measure the effects of all of the stimulus spending, including tax cuts. The CBO report also notes some inconsistencies in the way some people tabulated jobs data. Obama is technically accurate when he says the CBO found the economic stimulus has saved or created up to 1.6 million jobs. But he fails to report the bottom end of the CBO's projection -- 600,000. Had the CBO report concluded the jobs saved or created were somewhere between, say, 1.4 million and 1.6 million, we might have been more inclined to rate Obama's statement better. But the CBO's projected range is huge. The high end -- 1.6 million -- is nearly triple the low end. And so in this case, we think it's misleading to only cite the top end.

Inhofe claims that e-mails 'debunk' science behind climate change
","The newest tool in climate skeptics' arsenal: a series of  hacked e-mails  from the Climatic Research Unit, a branch of the University of East Anglia in the United Kingdom.

The correspondence, which was stolen from CRU's server sometime around Nov. 20, has some saying that the scientific underpinnings of climate change are false.

When asked on Dec. 7, 2009, about the Environmental Protection Agency's recent announcement that it will now consider carbon dioxide a pollutant, a move that clears the way for stricter regulations of the greenhouse gas, longtime climate change critic Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla., had this to say on CNN's  The Situation Room  :

""We see that that science [behind the announcement] has been pretty well debunked,"" he said referring to the e-mails. ""I remember a long time ago ... I made a speech on the Senate floor where I talked about all these scientists coming in, talking about how they can't get their side on there and the science is all rigged. ... Sure enough, what is happening today in this whole debate is just what we said was happening four years ago.""

Specifically, Inhofe was talking about data that the EPA used to form its decision. It came from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a scientific body that ""reviews and assesses the most recent scientific, technical and socioeconomic information produced worldwide relevant to the understanding of climate change."" Thousands of scientists contribute data to the organization voluntarily, including scientists at CRU, the group whose e-mails were hacked.

We've been following the complicated e-mail controversy for weeks, but there have been a number of issues that make fact-checking claims about the issue difficult. To start, the e-mails were obtained illegally, which raises questions about their validity. Some e-mails simply demonstrate a professional rivalry between scientists, a phenomenon that's nothing new to the profession. Scientists are disputing the meaning of some of the language in the e-mails. Finally, CRU has announced that it is conducting its own investigation into whether data were tossed out or otherwise manipulated unethically; that investigation is not complete.

We do know that these e-mails clearly demonstrate some petty professional backstabbing and a degree of skepticism within the CRU circle about opinions that do not match their own.  Read our story on the e-mail controversy  .

We also know this: The e-mails do not prove that climate change is a hoax.

Here's why: Independent of CRU's data, agencies and academics all over the world are coming to essentially the same conclusion: Climate change is happening.

Just take a recent report issued by the  United States Global Research Program  , an arm of the government that, since 1989, has been coordinating and integrating federal research on changes in the global environment and their implications for society. The report states that ""global warming is unequivocal and primarily human-induced. ... Warming over this century is projected to be considerably greater than over the last century. The global average temperature since 1900 has risen by about 1.5ºF. By 2100, it is projected to rise another 2 to 11.5ºF.""

There are other ways to quantify these changes. NASA, for instance, tracks data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center at the University of Colorado at Boulder to see how temperatures are affecting the arctic. The most recent data show that 2009 marks the third-lowest Arctic sea ice minimum on record.

Similarly, data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration show that sea levels over the past 100 years are rising at an average rate of 1.7 millimeters annually, ""which is significantly larger than the rate averaged over the last several thousand years. Since 1993, global sea level has risen at an accelerating rate of around 3.5 mm/year. Much of the sea level rise to date is a result of increasing heat of the ocean causing it to expand.""

And here's an important point on NOAA's Web site:

""A number of agencies around the world have produced datasets of global-scale changes in surface temperature using different techniques to process the data and remove measurement errors that could lead to false interpretations of temperature trends,"" the Web site says. ""The warming trend that is apparent in all of the independent methods of calculating global temperature change is also confirmed by other independent observations, such as the melting of mountain glaciers on every continent, reductions in the extent of snow cover, earlier blooming of plants in spring, a shorter ice season on lakes and rivers, ocean heat content, reduced arctic sea ice, and rising sea levels.""

In short, temperatures are rising.

So, to say that the CRU e-mails debunk the science supporting climate change leaves out the important point that CRU isn't the only organization looking at the issue. Indeed, there are reams of data that show temperatures are increasing and that greater concentrations of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are largely to blame. On this one, Inhofe is False.",/factchecks/2009/dec/12/james-inhofe/inhofe-claims-cru-e-mails-debunk-science-behind-cl/

Proposals allow emerging economies more carbon emissions

""Unlike the proposals China and India offered prior to Copenhagen -- which actually allow them to increase their emissions -- President Obama's proposal calls for serious cuts in our own long-term carbon emissions,"" she wrote.

Is that really what is happening? On Nov. 27, 2009, China announced it will lower emissions 40 to 45 percent below 2005 levels by 2020.

That may sound like a lot, but it's important to read the fine print here. China is talking about lowering carbon intensity. It's a measurement of how much energy it takes to produce a given amount of economic output. Climate experts say this means emissions from China will likely continue to grow along with its economy, but not as quickly as they would have otherwise.

""Let's say you commit to an intensity target of -6% per year in carbon/GDP,"" wrote climate scientist Jonathan Koomey, professor at Yale University’s School of Forestry and Environmental Studies. ""If your GDP grows at 10% per year, that means your carbon emissions will still grow 4% per year. So you're improving your carbon efficiency but absolute emissions are still increasing.""

Indeed, China's GDP is growing rapidly. In the third quarter of this year, it grew 8.9 percent, likely bringing the total annual growth to 8 percent.

On Dec. 4, India offered a similar proposal. Officials there say the country is prepared to cut carbon intensity from 20 to 25 percent by 2020. It's a landmark announcement for India; traditionally, the country has argued that it cannot afford to curb greenhouse gas emissions. But like China, India's economy is growing rapidly, and with it its carbon emissions.

Obama, on the other hand, is arguing for a cut large enough that the United States would see an absolute reduction in emissions, explained Koomey. (Obama's plan to trim emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 is part of a cap-and-trade change bill pending in the House of Representatives. A Senate bill would require a 20 percent cut.) Koomey, like many climate scientists, say overall cuts -- even from developing countries -- are necessary to really slow down climate change. While the United States' proposed cuts are more stringent than those proposed by China or India, they're less aggressive than the 25 to 50 percent emissions reduction scientists say countries must adopt to hold global average temperature increases to about 2 degrees Celsius.

So, where does that leave Palin's claim? She's correct that China and India's plans will allow them to increase emissions, while the United States would have to cut back. For this claim, Palin gets a True.",/factchecks/2009/dec/11/sarah-palin/copenhagen-treaty-allows-emerging-economies-more-c/
"['National', 'Economy', 'Pundits', 'Workers', 'Rush Limbaugh']","
Limbaugh says unemployment drop was skewed by Thanksgiving holiday
","On his Dec. 8, 2009, radio show, conservative host Rush Limbaugh mocked President Barack Obama's claim that the job market is stabilizing.

Limbaugh played a tape of Obama giving a speech on the economy and jobs earlier that morning at the Brookings Institution in Washington. ""Finally,"" Obama said, ""we're no longer seeing the severe deterioration in the job market that we once were. In fact, we learned on Friday (Dec. 4) that the unemployment rate fell slightly last month.""

Then Limbaugh interrupts. ""Stop the tape. That's because the figures were taken over two days of the Thanksgiving week where people were not working, were not looking for work, were not filing claims and so this -- wait 'til that number is revised. Wait 'til the number ends up being revised. It's going to go up.""

To determine whether the timing of a holiday could disrupt a long-standing federal statistic, we'll start by looking at the figures Obama was referring to.

The numbers released Dec. 4 were the ones that most people think of whenever they think of unemployment statistics -- namely, the ""unemployment rate"" as calculated by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics using the Current Population Survey. Using in-person and phone interviews, Labor Department officials track a sampling of households to determine each member's status in the work force, then use that raw data to help calculate the unemployment rate.

On Dec. 4, officials announced that unemployment in November had edged downward, to 10.0 from 10.2 percent in October. That is the slight fall that the president referenced in his speech.

But experts say this data couldn't have been skewed by Thanksgiving week, for two reasons.

First, the Current Population Survey interviews always refer to someone's employment status during week that includes the 12th of the month. This November, that was the week of Monday, Nov. 9, to Friday, Nov. 13 -- two weeks  before  Thanksgiving. Second, the data from the Current Population Survey is ""seasonally adjusted."" That means that before the numbers are released, officials adjust them to smooth out any fluctuations caused by the calendar. Even though the term ""seasonally adjusted"" makes it sound as if officials only adjust the numbers to reflect variations tied to winter, spring, summer and fall, the adjustments also take into account factors that could make a particular week an oddity.

The Labor Department and economists say that the seasonal adjustments are based on well-established trends and would take into account any quirks from the presence of a holiday during the data-collection week.

So Limbaugh is incorrect that the unemployment rate cited by Obama could have been skewed by what was happening during Thanksgiving week.

That said, Limbaugh's assertion isn't entirely out of left (or right) field.

There's another unemployment statistic that typically gets some coverage in the media, though less than the unemployment rate: the number of initial jobless claims. This statistic is compiled by a different part of the Labor Department -- the Employment and Training Administration -- and reflects all available data on residents who are applying for unemployment insurance for the first time.

And this year, just a day before the unemployment rate was announced, an initial jobless claims number was released ... using statistics collected during Thanksgiving week (although not just on two days of that week, as Limbaugh said). As it happened, those numbers fell slightly as well.

Some economists say that having a holiday fall during the data collection week is at least a potential problem for statistical reliability. Adolfo Laurenti, deputy chief economist and managing director of Mesirow Financial Holdings Inc., said that the survey's reliance on 50 different state agencies for data makes it somewhat more susceptible to anomalies, such as the timing of a holiday.

But the numbers for the initial jobless claims, like the Current Population Survey figures, are seasonally adjusted, based on the Labor Department's years of experience with recurring patterns. So the fact that Thanksgiving fell during this week should not make a difference with this data, either. One final note: On Dec. 10, 2009, the initial jobless claims numbers for the week ending Dec. 5 were released, and they were higher than they were the previous week. Limbaugh can perhaps take a measure of vindication, but it should not obscure the fact that his claim of holiday bias is incorrect. Skepticism about the seasonal adjustment methodology could lead someone to believe that the initial jobless claim numbers were skewed by the holiday week. But it would be a stretch for Limbaugh to argue that he was referring to initial jobless claims rather than the unemployment rate. Not only is the unemployment rate the most commonly cited unemployment statistic, but Obama, in the taped lead-in, clearly refers to the ""unemployment rate."" Since this statistic uses data about what was happening two weeks before Thanksgiving -- and since both measures are seasonally adjusted to eliminate factors such as holidays -- we rate Limbaugh's statement False.",/factchecks/2009/dec/10/rush-limbaugh/limbaugh-says-unemployment-drop-was-skewed-thanksg/
"['Environment', 'National', 'Climate Change', 'Pundits', 'Eugene Robinson']","
Robinson claims the fall of USSR meant a big drop in greenhouse gas emissions
","This week, world leaders are meeting in Copenhagen, Denmark, to try to hammer out a global climate accord.
 
Washington Post  columnist Eugene Robinson had this to say about the upcoming summit in his Dec. 1, 2009, column:
 
""When the Copenhagen climate summit convenes next week, the European nations that have led the crusade against global warming will be able to report that the continent has met the targets for carbon-emission reductions set in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. There may be shoulder dislocations from all the self-congratulatory back-patting,"" Robinson wrote. ""But the Kyoto targets were well on the way toward being met before they were even established. The targets are based on 1990 emissions levels -- after the Soviet Union and the East Bloc had been fouling the air for years with their antiquated, carbon-spewing heavy industries. When the communist regimes -- and their creaky economies -- collapsed in a heap, emissions from the former Soviet-dominated zone fell by nearly 40 percent. ... This post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim.""
 
Like Robinson, we expect the next 10 days to be full of complicated discussion about carbon emissions and reductions -- and a lot of boasting by the United States, Europe and other countries about all they're doing to slow climate change. So his claim about emissions reductions in former Soviet territory intrigued us.
 
But before we dig into this statement, a little background on the meeting in Copenhagen will be useful. It's arguably the most important climate gathering since 1997, when participating countries adopted the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan. Collectively, 38 industrialized countries -- otherwise known as Annex B countries -- committed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 5 percent below 1990 levels. At the time, 15 of those countries were members of the nascent European Union. The rest included Canada, Australia, and a handful of Eastern European countries recently liberated from the former Soviet Union; the protocol refers to these nations as ""economies in transition.""
 
The United States never ratified the treaty. In fact, according to data from the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Web site -- an international treaty written in 1992 meant to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations  -- our emissions have increased 17 percent over 1990 levels.
 
The protocol went into force in 2005, and it expires in 2012. So, world leaders are gathering in Copenhagen with the hope of laying the groundwork for the next round of emissions reductions. However, it's unclear what will actually be accomplished at the meeting. Congress has been  slow to act  on a  cap-and-trade bill  , which was initially considered the United States' strongest bargaining chip. And negotiations haven't been helped by news of hacked e-mails between climate scientists at Climate Research Unit that skeptics say  show disagreement  on the seriousness of global warming.
 
Historical data from the UNFCCC show that greenhouse gas emissions in Eastern Europe dropped dramatically after the Soviet Union dissolved in 1991. For example, Ukraine's annual carbon dioxide emissions dropped from 715 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 1990 to 426 metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 1994.
 
All the experts we spoke with agreed this drop was due to the collapse of the Soviet Union. They also told us that a specific drop of ""nearly 40 percent"" was also in the ballpark. We asked Robinson, and he pointed us to  this post  on the Green Grok, a respected blog about environmental issues maintained by the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, that includes a chart of emissions reductions derived from the most recent UNFCCC data. Indeed, in 2007, emissions from eastern European countries were still about 37 percent below 1990 levels, according to the blog.
 
They agreed that Robinson's second point -- that the ""post-Soviet industrial meltdown is responsible for most of the progress in reducing carbon emissions that Europe is able to claim"" -- has some truth to it. But they also told us that the story is more complicated than Robinson makes it seem.
 
Emissions in Europe have fallen for several reasons, said Michael Levi, director of the program on energy security and climate change for the Council on Foreign Relations. For example, during the 1990s, the United Kingdom switched from coal energy to natural gas, which helped trim emissions. And Europe's population has remained relatively flat.
 
But more importantly, Europe has had some pretty serious policies in place to reduce emissions, Levi said, including a carbon trading plan and incentives for alternative energy production.
 
""Overall, [Robinson's] point is correct, but it's overstated,"" he said.
 
Prasad Kasibhatla, associate professor at Nicholas School, agreed.

""The essence of the claim by Eugene Robinson is indeed correct,"" he wrote us in an e-mail. ""According to the latest year of reporting (2007), emission reductions in the EU-15 were driven largely by large reductions in Germany and the U.K. Part of the large reductions in Germany were driven by reunification with East Germany and part of the large reductions in the U.K. were driven by switch from coal to natural gas due to reforms of energy markets.""

Those variables paired with new climate change policies have reduced emissions in Western European countries by 4 percent, according to UNFCCC data.

In an e-mail, Robinson agreed that he may have glossed over that point.

""The EU countries did reduce emissions by 4 percent; I gave them credit for holding emissions down but perhaps not enough credit for the actual reduction.""

We also think it may have been more accurate for Robinson to clarify that the ""Europeans"" included the transitioning economies from the former Soviet bloc.

But Robinson argued that his overall point stands.

""The point I was trying to make, and I still believe it's valid, is that the Soviet bloc collapse created a huge, one-time fall-off in emissions that makes the numbers look better than they otherwise would against the Kyoto targets,"" he wrote.

With that point, we concur. Our experts tell us that it's widely understood that the fall of the Soviet Union meant major reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in Europe. But they also said that Robinson glosses over important points in his statement, including that many European Union countries have taken key steps to slow climate change.

Pence says Democrats' plan to spend TARP money on economic stimulus is unlawful
","In a speech at the Brookings Institution on Dec. 8, 2009, President Barack Obama proposed a whole new batch of economic stimulus initiatives -- everything from tax breaks for small businesses to investments in roads, bridges and other infrastructure projects. And Obama said the programs could largely be paid for with money realized by new forecasts that the cost of the bailout of financial institutions last fall, otherwise known as the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), will be $200 billion less than anticipated earlier this year. Some of that money would go toward reducing the deficit, Obama said, but some could offset the cost of the new programs. Many Republican leaders cried foul, saying any money unspent or paid back to the TARP program must go to pay down the national debt. U.S. Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana, chairman of the House Republican Conference, went one step further, saying Obama's plan would violate the law. ""The TARP legislation actually rightly demanded that any money not used to purchase toxic assets in the bill be used to pay down the national debt,"" Pence said from the floor of the House on Dec. 8, 2009. ""The legislation specifically says that any leftover TARP money goes to deficit reduction.""

""Let me be clear on this point,"" Pence added. ""To use money from the TARP fund in the manner that is being discussed by the White House and congressional Democrats would be a violation of the law, and it would betray the trust of the American people."" Does the law really bar Congress from spending that TARP money on the kind of economic stimulus described by the president? Here's what the TARP legislation states in Section 106, Part D: ""Revenues of, and proceeds from the sale of troubled assets purchased under this Act, or from the sale, exercise, or surrender of warrants or senior debt instruments acquired under section 113 shall be paid into the general fund of the Treasury for reduction of the public debt."" But budget experts say there are ways Congress could get around that, legally. Congress could rescind the TARP money and then, in a separate action, use the savings to offset the stimulus, said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""So technically, it would not be TARP money,"" Riedl said. ""But in all honesty, it'd be a shell game to use what would have been used for TARP to offset these expansions of government. If they do it this way, I believe it would be legal, although it would definitely go against the spirit of the TARP program."" Congress could also opt to simply change the TARP legislation it made last year, said James Gattuso, a senior fellow in regulatory policy at Heritage. But no matter how it's done, he said, to use money from TARP for economic stimulus would grow the national debt. ""To say this is deficit-neutral is ignoring reality,"" Gattuso said. Legislators who proposed TARP never anticipated it'd lose all of the money. Dean Baker, an economist and co-director of the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, assumes Congress would simply spend the new stimulus money as if the TARP program never existed. ""The TARP money automatically reverts to the Treasury under the law,"" Baker said. ""So when Obama says that he will use TARP money to pay down the deficit, he is just saying that he does not intend to violate the law.

""Congress can of course vote to spend new money on anything it wants,"" Baker said. ""If it votes to spend new money that it wants to call 'TARP money,' it is free to do so also. That seems to be what is going on here."" For his part, Obama addressed the concerns about not putting the TARP money entirely toward direct debt reduction. ""There are those who claim we have to choose between paying down our deficits on the one hand, and investing in job creation and economic growth on the other,"" Obama said in his speech at Brookings. ""This is a false choice. Ensuring that economic growth and job creation are strong and sustained is critical to ensuring that we are increasing revenues and decreasing spending on things like unemployment insurance so that our deficits will start coming down. At the same time, instilling confidence in our commitment to being fiscally prudent gives the private sector the confidence to make long-term investments in our people and in America."" But our question is whether Congress can legally pull off what President Obama has proposed. Pence is correct that there is a provision in TARP that prohibits the government from directly spending TARP funds on some of the programs Obama outlined. But even conservative budget analysts say there are legislative ways for that money to be legally recycled back into federal coffers and then applied to economic stimulus projects. And so we rate Pence's statement Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/8678f709-274e-47fc-a449-86cb41553c86",/factchecks/2009/dec/08/mike-pence/pence-says-democrats-plan-spend-tarp-money-economi/

Gov. Jindal predicts Saints will be first to go undefeated and win Super Bowl
","
After the New Orleans Saints squeaked by with an overtime win over the hapless Washington Redskins on Dec. 6, 2009, Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was apparently feeling pretty confident about his undefeated Saints.
 
""I'm predicting we'll go, not only undefeated, but all the way through the Super Bowl -- something that's never been done before,"" Jindal said in an interview with radio station WWL in New Orleans the day after the game. ""I think the Saints are going to set a national record right here.""
 
Clearly, Jindal, who has been talked about as a presidential contender, has not seen the annual -- some would say obnoxious -- champagne celebration by some members of the 1972 Dolphins after the last undefeated NFL team falls. Led by coach Don Shula and quarterback Bob Griese, that Dolphins team laid claim to the first and only ""perfect season,"" going 14-0 in the regular season and then going on to win the Super Bowl.
 
""With all due respect to Governor Jindal, our fans in Louisiana and elsewhere will be disappointed to learn that he forgot about the most accomplished team in NFL history -– the 1972 'Perfect Season' Miami Dolphins,"" Harvey Greene, the team’s senior vice president of media relations, wrote in an e-mail to

Politico

, which detailed Jindal's misstep.


""We wish the Saints, and the Indianapolis Colts, who are also undefeated, the best of luck in their attempt to match our undefeated season, and we will be the first to congratulate either team if they accomplish that feat. But until then, we remain the only perfect team in NFL history, an achievement our players and coaches rightly are proud of.""
 
That's the kind of measured response we might have expected from the Dolphins' front office.
 
But with the Saints still only 12-0 (they'd need to win four more regular season games and three playoff games to finish perfect), we think this smack talk from former Dolphins running back Mercury Morris, uttered when the New England Patriots made a run at a perfect season in 2007, is perhaps more appropriate: ""Like I said, don't call me when you're in my town, call me when you're on my block and I see you next door moving your furniture in.""
 
We're all for hometown boostering, especially from a guy like Gov. Jindal who said he suffered through the Saints' many bad years too, but we're all about the facts here, and he fumbled this one. We rate his statement False.

Beck says labor leader is most frequent White House visitor
","Fox News Channel host Glenn Beck recently found another rhetorical weapon to use against President Barack Obama: White House visitor logs.

In a Dec. 3, 2009, broadcast, Beck decried that Andy Stern, head of the Service Employees International Union, appears more times in a White House visitor log release than anyone else.

""You've got to ask yourself what the hell happened to this country,"" Beck said. ""If I would have told you instead that the most frequent visitor of the White House, over the secretary of state and everybody else, is a labor union president [Stern] who has repeatedly said workers of the world unite ... would you have believed it?"" (For the record, ""Workers of the world, unite!"" is the popular, if unofficial, translation of the final exhortation in Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels'  Communist Manifesto  .)

We found the source of Beck's claim. When the White House released its first batch of visitor logs on Oct. 30, 2009, as part of a pledge to bring more transparency to the White House, Stern's name did indeed appear 22 times, more than anyone else listed, including Clinton, who was listed three times.

But that's not the whole story.

Stern led the pack for the first data release, which covered visits from Jan. 20, 2009 to July 31, 2009. But he was surpassed by several other individuals in the second release, which updates the data through Aug. 31, 2009 (and which was made public more than a week before Beck aired his comment).

Among those who visited more frequently than Stern, according to the combination of the two logs, were Lewis (Lee) Sachs, counselor to Treasury Secetary Timothy Geithner, with 92 visits; associate attorney general Tom Perrelli, with 49; Federal Communications Commission chairman Julius Genachowski with 47; Spencer Overton, principal deputy assistant attorney general, with 38; and Health and Human Services office of health reform director Jeanne Lambrew, with 27. (Stern visited twice more during the period covered by the second batch of data, giving him a total of 24 visits.)

Another complication is that the first batch of data -- covering the period from Jan. 20, 2009, to July 31, 2009, which found Stern in the lead -- is not a complete accounting of White House visits during that period. It only includes data for visitors whose names were first requested by the public. If no one requested a specific name, that name would not appear in the database. So there's no way of knowing whether Stern actually had the most visits for that period; he simply had the most of anyone whose name was requested by the public. (All records dated after Sept. 15, 2009, will be released, the White House says, with exceptions for issues of national security, personal safety and a few other caveats.)

Finally, there are a lot of important people whose visits are not ordinarily captured by the White House log system -- most notably, Cabinet members, like the one Beck mentioned, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton.

While the visitor logs show a mere three visits by Clinton, we were able to confirm at least 26 separate White House visits by the secretary of state by using three public Web sites -- the White House's own site, the White House Flickr site and the State Department's site. Our sources column at the right includes the full list of Clinton's 26 visits, with links to the documentation. Since the White House has said that it cannot fulfill our request for a full listing of Clinton's White House visits, it's possible that the number of Clinton visits is actually higher. (And we have not included instances in which Clinton met with the president in locations away from the White House itself, such as flights aboard Air Force One and foreign travel, even though we found evidence documenting those sorts of visits as well.)

So, while Beck did pass along a widely reported finding as he made his point about Stern, the data it was based on was incomplete and out of date by the time of his show, and ultimately the conclusion he drew was incorrect. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2009/dec/07/glenn-beck/beck-says-labor-leader-most-frequent-white-house-v/

Obama said reporters didn't ask questions on the issues, but they did
","
At a jobs summit at the White House on Dec. 3, President Barack Obama closed his remarks with criticism of the media and the political culture in Washington, D.C.


Obama was responding to comments from the chairman and CEO of Ethan Allen, a furniture company, who said that the bad economy has forced companies to reinvent themselves and compete globally.


Obama said the United States needs to rediscover ""a sense of seriousness of purpose"" when it comes to education, to government managing money properly and to executives having an obligation to workers.


""It is important to understand what's at stake and that we can't keep on playing games,"" Obama added. ""I mentioned that I was in Asia on this trip, thinking about the economy. When I sat down for a round of interviews, not one of them asked me about Asia. Not one of them asked me about the economy. I was asked several times about, had I read Sarah Palin's book? True. But it's an indication of how -- how, you know, our political debate doesn't match up with what we need to do and where we need to go.""


Obama's audience laughed when Obama mentioned Palin, the Republican Party's 2008 vice presidential nominee.


We decided to check the transcripts to see what Obama was asked on his trip. We wanted to see if it was true that he hadn't been asked any questions about the economy or Asia.


Obama gave a round of brief interviews while traveling in Asia, with most of his comments airing on American television Nov. 18. The coverage shows that four reporters got roughly 10 minutes each with the president.


We reviewed the transcripts and found several examples to contradict Obama's statement. On Asia, Chuck Todd of NBC News asked Obama about human rights in China, and Major Garrett of Fox News asked Obama about trade agreements with South Korea. Both Todd and Garrett asked about the administration's efforts to create jobs. Todd asked how the announced jobs summit would actually create jobs, and Garrett asked if job creation efforts would add to the deficit. Todd did not ask about Palin, though Garrett did.


The other interviews we found were with Ed Henry of CNN and Chip Reid of CBS News. Both of them also asked about Palin. Henry also asked a viewer question about what Obama was doing to hold banks accountable for lending to startups and refinancing mortgages.


Every interviewer spoke with Obama about making a decision about troop levels in Afghanistan, and most of them also asked about health reform. (ABC News did not join the round of interviews.)


Yes, three of four reporters asked Obama about Sarah Palin. A recent

Washington Post

poll showed Palin to be the top choice of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents for the 2012 GOP presidential nomination. Palin garnered 17 percent, followed by Mike Huckabee with 10 percent and Mitt Romney with 9 percent. Her memoir was released the day before the interviews aired.


Obama said at the Dec. 3 jobs forum that when he was in Asia and granted interviews to reporters, ""not one of them asked me about Asia. Not one of them asked me about the economy."" That is clearly an exaggeration. We found that two reporters asked him about Asia, two reporters asked him about job creation, and another reporter asked him about mortgages and lending. He said ""not one"" did, implying that the interviews lacked substance. We rate his statement False.

"['Elections', 'Texas', ""Beto O'Rourke""]","
Is Texas one of the nation's most gerrymandered states, as Beto O'Rourke said?
","During a visit to HBO’s ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke brought up the issue of gerrymandering -- the drawing of district lines to benefit a particular party or group. ""Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the union,"" O’Rourke said during the episode. (It’s at about 2:58 in this video.) Is that correct? We found that this is more of a fuzzy issue than a precise one, but the evidence suggests that it was not unreasonable for O’Rourke to make this declaration. ""By most objective statistical or mathematical measures, Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the U.S.,"" said Daniel McGlone, a senior analyst with Azavea, a Philadelphia-based firm that has studied congressional district line-drawing. Michael Li, senior counsel with the Democracy Program at New York University Law School’s Brennan Center for Justice, agreed. ""At the congressional level, it’s fair to say Texas is one of the most skewed"" based on partisan bias, Li said. The hardest part of analyzing O’Rourke’s statement is sorting through countless measurements that can be used, experts said. ""Does he mean gerrymandered by party? By race? Does he mean that the districts don't conform to traditional geographic criteria? You have to define what is meant by ‘gerrymandered’ before you can rank every state on a single scale,"" said Eric McGhee, a research fellow at the Public Policy Institute of California. (O’Rourke’s staff did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Into the void have rushed ""legal experts, mathematicians, data scientists and other experts suggesting various metrics or combinations of metrics to score and judge whether a district or plan is gerrymandered,"" McGlone said. A 2017 analysis by Azavea used a method called the ""efficiency gap,"" a statistic developed by McGhee and Nicholas Stephanopoulos of the University of Chicago Law School in 2014. It measures how many votes a party ""wastes"" in a small number of districts. If the district lines had been drawn more efficiently -- essentially, more equitably -- these ""wasted"" votes could have been used to make other districts more competitive. Using this method, Azavea ranked Texas as the fifth-most gerrymandered state, behind North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and New York. Another 2017 analysis, by the liberal Brennan Center, found that the three states with the strongest partisan bias in their district lines were Michigan, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania, followed by a second tier that included Florida, Ohio, Virginia -- and Texas, placing O’Rourke’s state in the top seven in this analysis. A third analysis, from December 2015, was undertaken by Christopher Ingraham, a data specialist previously with the Brookings Institution and the Pew Research Center and now with the Washington Post’s Wonkblog section. Ingraham’s calculation placed Texas seventh, behind California, Pennsylvania, Ohio, New York, North Carolina and Virginia. (All three of these studies looked at Pennsylvania's district lines before they were overturned and redrawn in 2018)   Ranking Azavea Brennan Center Ingraham 1. North Carolina Michigan California 2. Pennsylvania North Carolina Pennsylvania 3. Michigan Pennsylvania Ohio 4. New York Florida * New York 5. Texas Ohio * North Carolina 6. 21-state tie Texas * Virginia 7. -- Virginia * Texas 8. -- Not specified Michigan 9. -- -- Florida 10. -- -- Indiana * Study did not distinguish ranking spots among these states So in these studies, Texas consistently places somewhere between the fifth and seventh most gerrymandered states. Each of these three analyses were derived from both geographical and political factors, taking into account both linear geometry and voting patterns. That makes these studies the most useful ones for analyzing O’Rourke’s comment, since he used the term ""gerrymandering,"" placing the remark in a political context. A few other studies have taken a more limited look, focusing only on how complicated the district lines are, typically using the yardstick of ""compactness."" A perfect square or circle is compact; an octopus-shaped district is the opposite. A more complicated district border may be a sign that the line-drawers in the state legislature drew the map with partisan factors in mind. In compactness-only analysis, the congressional lines in Texas also rank as pretty non-compact, but not as high on the list of states as in the studies that take into account partisan voting history as well. One Azavea study used four different mathematical methods to calculate a district’s compactness. Texas ranked between 11th and 15th least compact in these four measurements. And Brian Kurilla, a North Carolina-based cognitive psychologist who writes the Geek Psychologist blog, found that Texas ranked 12th lowest in compactness. These studies are less helpful in analyzing O’Rourke’s remark, since there may -- or may not -- be a connection between byzantine district borders and partisan biases. ""There are many reasons why a district might be non-compact, only one of which is partisan intent,"" said William T. Adler, a computational research specialist at the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. Others could be patterns of population settlement or natural geographical features, for instance. A third way to look at the question involves racial disparities enforced through congressional line-drawing. This is a harder-to-quantify factor, but Texas has been enmeshed in race-based redistricting lawsuits for years, suggesting that it would rank high if this metric were used instead. ""Texas is a persistent offender"" on race-based redistricting, said Sam Wang, a neuroscience professor who heads the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. ""Texas' redistricting shenanigans are never-ending."" O’Rourke said, ""Texas is one of the most gerrymandered states in the union."" There are many ways to analyze this question, and depending on the method, the rankings vary a bit. But studies that look at the intersection of geographical compactness and partisan voting history consistently place Texas between fifth and seventh on the list of most gerrymandered states in the nation. Since O’Rourke called Texas ""one of the most"" gerrymandered states, such studies support his point. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2018/aug/16/beto-orourke/texas-one-nations-most-gerrymandered-states/

Bill Nelson uses campaign consultants; he doesn't steal from Medicare or Social Security
","A new attack ad portrays U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson as scamming his employees and the federal government by avoiding payroll taxes. The ad, released by Republican challenger Gov. Rick Scott, claims, ""(Bill) Nelson doesn’t pay payroll taxes for his employees. He doesn’t even provide them with health benefits. It’s stealing money from Medicare and Social Security."" Several PolitiFact readers emailed us ([email protected]) to ask if the ad was accurate, so we decided to fact-check it. The ad includes a headline that says, ""Bill Nelson’s campaign avoiding taxes, health care costs on campaign staff."" So we ruled out that Nelson’s official Senate staff were the employees the ad was talking about. The headline is from the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative news organization, which published an article July 13 stating that Nelson had not hired any full-time employees on his Senate campaign. Federal campaigns are required to disclose their spending information to the Federal Election Commission, which regulates campaign finances. When the story was published, the Nelson campaign had not disclosed any ""disbursements"" labeled as payroll. Likewise, there were no insurance payments for workers listed in FEC filings between January 2017 and June 2018. When we dug in deeper, we found that the Nelson campaign didn’t have any full-time staff to pay taxes on. In the first half of the year, the Nelson campaign was using paid consultants. ""This isn’t unusual, as most political campaigns rely heavily on consultants, especially early on in the cycle,"" said Nelson spokeswoman Carlie Waibel. Employers do not need to pay the payroll tax on consultants. They also do not need to provide health benefits. Paul Herrnson, professor of political science at the University of Connecticut, said hiring consultants is relatively common, especially for incumbent politicians. Incumbents may work with consultants — often people and firms they’ve worked with on previous campaigns or during their time in office — to help raise money, conduct polls, and organize early campaign efforts. Staff for a campaign are hired to manage day-to-day activities and voter mobilization closer to the election.   We checked the FEC filings to see if other campaigns relied heavily on consultants. We focused on nearly a dozen similar races— battleground states with an incumbent running for re-election. Based on the FEC filings for these campaigns, all 11 incumbents had hired staff (and paid payroll taxes) by June, when the last filing was due. Nelson’s tactics, while legal, do seem to be uncommon. (Some Democrats have criticized Nelson’s campaign as understaffed and overmatched.) The Nelson campaign hired some full-time employees in early July, according to Waibel, but these changes have not been reported to the FEC yet. The next filing is due on Aug. 16, and Nelson will have to begin paying payroll taxes on these new employees. As for health insurance, Waibel said, ""Nelson for Senate staff are compensated to ensure they have access to health care. Health care costs are considered when establishing staffer's salaries."" The ad is somewhat outdated, but it does align with the most recent data available online.   The ad also claims that Nelson is ""stealing money from Medicare and Social Security"" by not paying payroll taxes. The payroll tax is one of the major financiers for Medicare and Social Security. But a company that pays consultants is not ""stealing"" from Medicare or Social Security. Here’s how it works: When a company pays a full-time employee, they set aside 7.65 percent of the employee’s check to go toward Medicare and Social Security. The employer will match that, so effectively 15.3 percent of the employee’s salary is paid to Social Security and Medicare. For consultants, things get a little more complicated. Consultants, like other contract workers, generally have to pay the full 15.3 percent themselves to Medicare and Social Security. If the consultant employed his or her own full-time employees, the employees would pay half and their employer (the consultant) would pay half.   The same amount of money will go to Medicare and Social Security, regardless of whether the Nelson campaign pays it or the consultants do. This may be a cost-cutting measure for the campaign, but it certainly isn’t ""stealing,"" as the ad claims. Scott released an ad which claimed, ""Nelson doesn’t pay payroll taxes for his employees. He doesn’t even provide them with health benefits. It’s stealing money from Medicare and Social Security."" Nelson relied on consultants for the early parts of his campaign. Because he did not have employees, he did not have to pay payroll taxes or provide health insurance. In July, Nelson hired employees, though they will not report that change to the FEC until mid-August. The campaign still does not provide healthcare to their employees but says that salaries are adjusted so staff will have access to care. Nelson does not have to pay payroll taxes on consultants. Instead, the consultants pay the payroll taxes. This is a common set-up for contract work. No money is being lost or stolen from the national funds.

Donna Howard says charter schools draw more per-student state aid than socked school districts
","A Democratic legislator declared that state aid fully fuels Texas charter schools while schools serving the vast bulk of students field less money. State Rep. Donna Howard of Austin said in her July 18, 2018 tweet: ""Here's the thing. In Tx, charters get 100% state $/pupil funding while district schools (95% students) get about 1/3 funding from state w/ rest coming from local prop taxes (which is why those taxes are so high). Districts getting less b/c scarce $ going to charters."" Howard was reacting to a national Associated Press news story on billionaires championing charter schools. Since 2006, the story says, philanthropists and their private foundations and charities--topped by the Walton Family Foundation, run by heirs to the Walmart fortune--gave almost half a billion dollars to 52 state-level charter support organizations to sustain, defend and expand the charter schools movement. Texas charter schools--public schools with charters run most often by private nonprofit entities--have boomed since the 1995 Legislature authorized them by law. Such schools must meet state-set academic accountability standards, but they’re exempted from other laws affecting districts such as teacher certification and elementary school class-size limits. To our inquiry, Bruce Marchand of the Texas Charter Schools Association called Howard’s jam-packed claim factually ""squishy solid."" The squishy part, Marchand said by email, ""is the implication that ‘100% funded charters’ have something to do with high property taxes and that districts get less money because that money is going to charters."" Districts get less, Marchand said, because state dollars follow students based on where they’re enrolled. Let’s break down Howard’s tweet by its factual elements. Howard said charter schools get all their funding from the state: Charter schools get nearly all their funding from state aid, Marchand agreed by phone, drawing 3 percent from grants and federal sources. That heavy state reliance is logical, Marchand and others said, because unlike districts, charter schools lack the authority to levy property taxes. According to a December 2017 Texas Education Agency document summarizing charter school funding, state aid to charter schools escalated from nearly $417 million for 2005-06 to about $2 billion in 2015-16. Howard said school districts serve 95 percent of students: Charter schools serve a growing handful of pupils--5.5 percent of Texas public school students in 2017, according to figures we fielded by email from the TEA’s DeEtta Culbertson. That year, she said, 705 charter campuses enrolled 296,323 students--a doubling since 2011, according to an August 2018 agency presentation noted by Marchand. (The state caps the number of state-issued charters, but a charter-holder may open more than one school.) An implication: Districts in 2017 served 94.5 percent of public school students. Howard said districts get one-third of their aid from the state: Earlier this year, we reviewed Legislative Budget Board figures to conclude that in the 1980s, lawmakers voted for the state to cover 70 percent of the Foundation School Program, which is the state’s primary way of funding schools. State aid, we found, ended up covering a little more than half of related state-local costs. State aid covered 44 percent of such costs in 2016; it’s expected to cover 38 percent of such costs in 2019. That’s more than a third. When we sought Howard’s factual backup, Jacob Cottingham in her office responded with materials including a January 2018 LBB chart delivering percentages like what we previously reported. Cottingham also emailed us a spreadsheet isolating state aid going to districts alone. According to the sheet, which Cottingham said he built based on LBB data, in 2016, more than $17.8 billion in state aid sent to districts accounted for 39 percent of state spending on public education. The sheet says that in 2019, more than $15.7 billion in state funds projected to go to districts will account for 32 percent of state school aid. Howard said the state’s one-third share of what schools spend is why school property taxes are ""so high"":  To the contrary, we asked Howard, isn’t it changes in the value of local property tax bases that drive how much state aid a district is entitled to receive? Howard replied with a statement noting that a district’s per-pupil tax wealth is key to how much state aid flows. ""When students leave a district for a charter (or private school or drop out), the (district’s) property wealth per student increases as there are fewer students, and the state's required minimum share to the district is decreased,"" Howard said. The TEA’s Culbertson separately responded by email: ""One of the primary drivers of the Texas school finance system is student attendance. If a student leaves a school district for any reason, including moving out of state, enrolling in another school district, public charter school, or private school (including home school), the original school district would no longer incur the costs of educating that student, and the original school district’s total funding entitlement would be reduced."" Howard said districts get less money because dollars go to charter schools: Cottingham told us Howard reached that conclusion by reviewing changes in per-student state spending on charter schools and districts. Cottingham emailed us an LBB chart showing Foundation School Program state aid per student enrolled in districts compared with charter schools from fiscal 2010 through fiscal 2016 plus estimated and projected aid for fiscal 2017 through fiscal 2019. The chart shows charter schools consistently getting thousands of dollars more per student in ""average daily attendance:""  SOURCE: Chart, ""Foundation School Program State Aid and Average Daily Attendance for School Districts and Charter Schools, Fiscal Years 2010-19,"" Legislative Budget Board, 2018 (confirmed by email, R.J. DeSilva, communications officer, Legislative Budget Board, July 31, 2018) According to the chart, charter schools in 2016 fielded $8,956 in state aid per ADA and school districts on average drew $3,800--meaning charter schools got 136 percent of what districts drew. By our calculations, the chart shows charter schools getting 149 percent of what districts would have gotten in 2017 and 167 percent of what districts would get in 2018 and 190 percent of what districts would get in 2019. Cottingham told us the fact that state aid to districts goes up or down based on the value of local tax bases helps explain why districts are projected to get increasingly less in state aid than charter schools. Charter schools, he said, can count by law on getting each year’s full average adjusted state-aid allotment in contrast to districts whose allocations are affected by how much they’re expected to reap in property taxes. By phone, Amanda Brownson of  the Texas Association of School Business Officials offered a similar analysis. Another facet noted by Cottingham: The state ponies up the full per-student ""entitlement cost"" of each student--costing the state more than each per-student payment sent to districts. Of late, the August 2018 TEA presentation says, charter schools draw an adjusted state allotment of $6,540--equivalent, the agency says, to what a small district receives. Meantime, the presentation says, more than 95 percent of students enrolled in districts are in districts getting less than $6,540 in state allotments. We also heard back from Greg Worthington, a University of Texas doctoral student. By email, Worthington said legislation revising the school finance system that passed into law in a summer 2017 special session would result in numerous districts losing chunks of per-student aid as charter schools draw more. Asked how funding of charter schools results in less money for districts, Worthington offered a detailed reply centered on reductions in aid to districts caused by students transferring to charter schools. This shouldn’t surprise, Worthington indicated, in that the concept of school choice promulgated by the late economist Milton Friedman relies on schools competing for funding tied to enrollment. Friedman said government might be responsible for funding schools, Worthington wrote, but he maintained it isn’t supposed to administer education. School choice policies embraced by many ruling Republicans ""ultimately work to replace the public school system with a market-based education system,"" Worthington said. Our ruling Howard said Texas charter schools get all their per-student aid from the state while school districts, which serve 95 percent of students, get a third of their funding that way with the rest drawn from property taxes. Also, Howard said, districts get less because scarce dollars go to charter schools. Howard’s points about student enrollment and state funding going to charter schools and school districts hold up. It’s also true that a student who leaves a district school to attend a charter school costs the district state aid while that student brings the charter school thousands of dollars more in per-pupil state aid than what the district would get. This dense tweet lacks the clarification that upticks or slides in local property values greatly affect whether a district faces ups or downs in state aid. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Will Hurd way off on foe getting more money from Massachusetts residents than from Texans
","A Republican Texas congressman whose campaign has raised less money than his Democratic challenger says his opponent gathered a disturbing share of her receipts from that chilly faraway state where they park the car in Harvard Yard. An Aug. 8, 2018, San Antonio Express-News rundown of the race between Rep. Will Hurd of Helotes and Democratic nominee Gina Ortiz Jones quotes Hurd saying of Jones: ""When you raise more money from Massachusetts than you do from Texas, that is not a good indication of your broad-based support."" Generally, the story also says, Jones, of San Antonio, outraised Hurd almost 2-1 in the second quarter of 2018, gathering $1.2 million to Hurd’s $684,000. Was Hurd right that Jones has raised more money from Massachusetts--about a 30-hour drive from the San Antonio-and-west 23rd Congressional District of Texas--than from Texas? We wondered. Hurd aide cites second-quarter figures To our inquiry, Connor Pfeiffer of Hurd’s campaign said by email that he downloaded campaign finance reports from the Federal Election Commission and then winnowed second-quarter donations to Jones’ campaign from individuals and PACs in the two states--which showed, Pfeiffer said, that Jones got nearly $730,000 from backers in the Bay State and nearly $367,000 from Texas donors. More than $500,000 via ActBlue? Off the bat, we noticed that Hurd’s analysis counts donations made by individuals to the Jones campaign via the ActBlue PAC, based in Somerville, Mass., as originating in Massachusetts. Pfeiffer said: ""I counted the money Jones received from ActBlue as receipts from the state of Massachusetts because ActBlue is a PAC in Massachusetts."" However, ActBlue doesn’t make candidate donations. Rather, Democratic aspirants and groups use the PAC’s online tools to manage donations from all over the country. The PAC says on its website that it ""acts as a conduit federally and in most states, which means we provide the infrastructure for campaigns and organizations to fundraise online, but we don’t fundraise on behalf of anyone."" By Pfeiffer’s accounting, donations made to Jones’s campaign via ActBlue amounted to more than $581,000 of what Hurd considers Massachusetts donations. Not counting that money reduces Jones’s Massachusetts haul to such an extent that the result appears to be, by Hurd's accounting, more than $200,000 less than what Hurd says Jones raised in Texas. Longer view And that result, we recognized, considers only the latest three months of donations reported by Jones to the FEC. For a longer view, we inquired into how much Jones has reaped in contributions reported throughout her campaign by asking the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign finance issues. A center analyst, Douglas Weber, replied that by its sort of itemized donations by individuals reported by Jones to the FEC, her campaign through June 2018 had raised $193,879 from Massachusetts residents and $353,293 from Texas residents. ""We generally do not count PAC contributions,"" Weber said by email, ""as many PACs are based in the D.C. area regardless of the organization."" Weber, asked about Hurd’s camp folding in donations conveyed through the ActBlue PAC, commented: ""They shouldn't include anything from ActBlue. ActBlue is a conduit--the address may be in Massachusetts but that's not where the contributions came from."" Separately, Judith Ingram, an FEC press officer, responding to our inquiry by checking Jones’s filed reports for donations fielded in each state. Ingram emailed us spreadsheets showing Jones getting $339,599 from more than 800 Texas donors and drawing $117,950 from more than 120 Massachusetts donors--with PACs not included in her tallies. With help from Ingram, we sifted the Ingram-presented donations to Jones to find that through June 2018, $36,150 of her donations from Massachusett residents flowed through the ActBlue PAC along with $167,593 of her contributions from Texans. Put another way, it looked to us like hundreds of thousands of dollars in contributions to Jones that Hurd attributed to Massachusetts residents came, via ActBlue, from people not living in Texas or Massachusetts. Pfeiffer, Hurd's spokesman, indicated by email that Hurd stands by what he said. Pfeiffer wrote: ""Based on the congressman's quote, the relevant question here is whether more money is flowing to Jones from Massachusetts than Texas. Jones is receiving a large amount of money from ActBlue, which is based in Massachusetts. What type of PAC ActBlue is does not change where they are based or the proximate source of the money flowing to Jones' campaign,"" Pfeiffer said. Our ruling Hurd said Jones has raised ""more money from Massachusetts than"" from Texas. To the contrary, records show Jones raising more in campaign funds from Texans than Massachusetts residents. The congressman’s analysis erroneously rests on counting donations ferried to Jones from donors all over the country through the Massachusetts-based ActBlue PAC as contributions made solely by people living in Massachusetts. We find Hurd's statement incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Graham in error on Florida charter school teacher certification
","Former U.S. Rep. Gwen Graham has promoted public education as her top priority in her campaign for governor, and she has openly criticized the charter school industry for drawing money away from traditional public schools. In an interview with editorial boards from major South Florida newspapers, Graham argued that some charter schools in Florida provided a subpar education. She said, ""The teachers in (charter) schools don't even have to be certified."" Charter schools operate as independent contractors within the public school system. These schools generally have more freedom to experiment than traditional public schools. Many are catered to specific subjects, like science or art, and some are organized for students with disabilities. However, with that increased freedom, charter schools are required to perform to a certain standard, and may be shut down if they fail. Most charter schools in Florida are run by the same statutes that govern public schools, and would therefore need certified teachers. But does Florida hold all charter schools to the same regulations? According to the Florida Department of Education, most charter school teachers are required to be certified. The certification process is mandated by the Florida K-20 Education Code, a subset of the 2018 Florida Statutes. Statute 1002.33 reads, ""Teachers employed by or under contract to a charter school shall be certified as required by chapter 1012."" Statute 1012, the same rule that governs traditional public schools, requires teachers to ""hold the certificate required by law and by rules of the State Board of Education"" in order to teach. However, certification is not mandatory for a subset of Florida charter schools, called the ""schools of hope."" These charter schools operate within underserved districts that have ""persistently low-performing schools."" The legislature hoped to attract successful charter organizations from other states by offering financial incentives and increased administrative freedom. Gov. Rick Scott signed the controversial bill, known as HB 7069, into law in July 2017. Graham did not specify in her interview with the editorial boards that she was referring to these schools. Her campaign clarified when we contacted them, and linked us to the bill. According to HB 7069, ""schools of hope"" can hire administrators and ""instructional personnel"" who do not meet the requirements for public school teachers, so long as they have not been convicted of any felonies or other serious crimes. Instructional personnel include lead classroom teachers. To obtain a Florida teaching certificate, teachers must have a bachelor’s degree and complete several state accreditation tests. Most notable are the Florida Teacher Certification examinations, which include a general knowledge test, a professional education test, and a subject area test. A school of hope teacher would not be required to pass any of these tests. As of August 2018, no ""schools of hope"" have opened in Florida. Four companies have been approved as ""hope operators,"" but none intend to begin operation for this school year. Thirteen counties have filed a lawsuit against HB 7069, arguing that it restricts the rights of districts to operate freely and violates the constitutional right to a uniform system of public schools.   ""Gwen believes charter schools must be held to the same standards as traditional public schools and, as governor, will fully enforce certification requirements,"" said Graham campaign spokesman Matt Harringer in an email. Graham said that ""The teachers in (charter) schools don't even have to be certified."" At every charter school currently operating in Florida, teachers are held to the same certification standards as they would be in public schools. At ""schools of hope,"" a recently introduced subset of charter schools, teachers will not need to be certified. Even when these schools begin operation, they will make up only a small percentage of the state's 654 existing charter schools. It is misleading to say that teachers in charter schools don't have to be certified when the vast majority of them do.

White House off-base comparing African-American job growth under Obama, Trump
","During a testy White House daily briefing that included discussion of former White House aide Omarosa Manigault Newman and her new tell-all book, White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders offered a series of favorable statistics about the economy under President Donald Trump. At one point, Sanders said, ""This president, since he took office, in the year and a half he’s been here, has created 700,000 new jobs for African-Americans. … When President Obama left, after eight years in office — eight years in office — he had only created 195,000 jobs for African-Americans. President Trump in his first year and a half has already tripled what President Obama did in eight years."" Sanders recounted the numbers under Trump accurately, but she vastly undercounted the number under Obama, leading to a misfire on the comparison between the two presidents. We turned to statistics from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source of employment data. First, a technical note. BLS uses two different surveys to create its familiar monthly employment report. When measuring how many jobs are created or lost nationally from month to month, economists generally turn to the bureau’s survey of business establishments rather than the bureau’s survey of households, because the establishment survey is considered more accurate for counting employment level. However, the establishment survey doesn’t break down data by race, so we had to turn to the data from the household survey, which does include a racial breakdown. Here’s a graph of what we found: The good news for Sanders is that she’s on target in describing the increase in African-American employment under Trump. From January 2017 to July 2018, the figure rose by 708,000, or essentially what Sanders said. The bad news for Sanders is that she dramatically undershot the amount of the increase under Obama. From January 2009 to January 2017 -- the eight-year period under Obama that she referred to -- African-American employment rose by just shy of 3 million. That’s vastly larger than the 195,000 she credited Obama with creating during that span. Sanders’ error dramatically alters the comparison between the two presidents. Rather than Trump tripling Obama’s increase in African-American employment, it is actually Obama who in eight years quadrupled the increase Trump oversaw in a year and a half. And Obama had to deal with the fall-out from the Great Recession during that period. (We should note, as we usually do, that presidents are not entirely responsible for job growth under their watch. Underlying economic trends tend to carry more weight that any particular president’s policies.) After we finished our reporting, the White House's Council of Economic Advisers sent a tweet that said, ""Apologies for @WhiteHouseCEA's earlier miscommunication to @PressSec."" Per @PressSec briefing today: pic.twitter.com/uQzsAkOH2i The tweet included a screenshot of data for the intended talking point -- ""minority employment changes 20 months after a presidential election."" For Obama's first term, according to the chart, African-American employment fell by 636,000, compared to a gain of 848,000 for Trump. However, Obama's first 20 months were dominated by the recession, unlike Trump's, making the comparison dubious.  The chart also offered the number for the first 20 months of Obama's second term, but it was only modestly below the gain under Trump -- 831,000. Later, Sanders herself tweeted, ""Correction from today’s briefing: Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn’t. I’m sorry for the mistake, but no apologies for the 700,000 jobs for African-Americans created under President Trump."" But her comparison in the tweet still didn't make much sense. To come up with the 195,000 figure, she added together the numbers for the first 20 months of Obama's first and second terms -- a disjointed period of time heavily influenced by the recession -- and compared it to the first 20 months of Trump's. Correction from today’s briefing: Jobs numbers for Pres Trump and Pres Obama were correct, but the time frame for Pres Obama wasn’t. I’m sorry for the mistake, but no apologies for the 700,000 jobs for African Americans created under President Trump https://t.co/EXGvbliwlS Sanders said, ""President Trump in his first year and a half has already tripled what President Obama did (for African-American employment) in eight years."" Sanders dramatically undercounted African-American employment gains under Obama. In reality, the correct Obama-Trump comparison shows the opposite of what Sanders indicated: African-American employment gains under Obama were four times higher than the gains to date on Trump’s watch. The White House's Council of Economic Advisers later tweeted a correction and apology. As is our policy, we rate the original statement False.",/factchecks/2018/aug/15/sarah-huckabee-sanders/white-house-base-comparing-african-american-job-gr/

Blackburn: Lack of broadband shuttered rural hospitals. It didn't
","At a gathering of the Tennessee Farm Bureau in Franklin, Tenn., Republican Senate nominee Rep. Marsha Blackburn, talked about things she would aim to reduce, such as EPA regulations, and things she would aim to build up, such as broadband internet. Blackburn said fast internet was important for education, and health care. ""Hospitals are closing in rural America because they don't have access to high-speed internet,"" she said Aug. 8. We decided to see if lack of broadband was as pivotal to rural hospitals as Blackburn said. Nationwide, 87 rural hospitals have closed or stopped providing in-patient care since 2010. The leading reasons these hospitals close include: 1. They serve older, poorer, and sicker communities where higher percentages of patients are covered through public insurance programs; 2. They have too few patients to support the size of the facility; 3. Medicaid and Medicare reimbursements often don’t cover their costs. Access to high-speed internet would help, but researchers were unable to identify a hospital that closed due to lack of access. The Sheps Center for Health Services Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill tracks rural hospital closures. The center’s director and senior researcher told the Senate Finance Committee in May that the causes are complicated, but they did see some patterns. ""Most closures and abandoned rural hospitals are in the South – 60 percent – where poverty rates are higher and people are generally less healthy and less likely to have health insurance, private or public,"" they said. They said in 2016, the average urban hospital had double the profit margin of the typical rural facility, about 5 percent compared to a bit over 2 percent. A profit margin that slender put hospitals at risk. Their testimony made no mention of high-speed internet. Shep Center research associate Kristie Thompson told us that ""we have not identified broadband or any other single cause for the rural hospital closures."" It’s not that broadband access wouldn’t help. It would. ""Without it, a hospital can’t perform to its potential,"" said Maggie Elehwany, vice president for policy at the National Rural Health Association. ""High-speed internet is definitely a factor in keeping a hospital in good condition. But you can’t say that the lack of it forced a hospital to close."" The trade group NTCA-Rural Broadband Association estimated that telemedicine through better broadband could boost the bottom line of the average rural hospital in Tennessee by about $150,000 a year. That is a relatively modest amount. We looked at the eight rural hospitals that have closed in Tennessee since 2010. No press release or news article mentioned the lack of high-speed internet as a driving factor. More common was a declining demand or advances in treatment that left the centers unable to compete. And some reports mentioned federal Medicaid and Medicare payments. Elehwany told us a major issue is a slide in government reimbursements. She said after a wave of rural hospitals shut their doors in the 1980s and 1990s, Congress designated these facilities as critical access hospitals, or other types of rural facilities, and paid them more generously under Medicare. Some states used that designation to boost Medicaid payments as well. ""Now, there’s been an erosion of payments to rural hospitals,"" Elehwany said. ""Sequestration was particularly damaging."" In an article in the Journal of Health Affairs, public health researchers at the University of Colorado reported that the Affordable Care Act appeared to play a role in rural hospital closure rates. States that expanded Medicaid saw the number of hospitals closing decrease drop steadily after 2014, while states that didn’t saw their closures first decline, and then rise. Overall, researchers said that Medicaid expansion was good for the hospitals’ bottom line. Tennessee did not expand Medicaid. Shep Center researchers said it is an open question whether Medicaid expansion alone lies behind these trends, but they noted that the disproportionate share of closures in the South overlaps with the states that were least likely to expand Medicaid. Abbi Sigler, spokeswoman for the Blackburn campaign told us that lack of access limits hospitals' ability to provide care. "" If we don’t improve high speed internet access to rural hospital providers, they will continue to close at alarming rates,"" Sigler said. She gave no example of a hospital that closed because it didn't have high-speed internet. Blackburn said that rural hospitals are closing because they don’t have access to high-speed internet. We could find no research to back that up. The country’s leading center for tracking rural hospital closures said it did not know of a case where lack of broadband caused a hospital to close. A broadband trade group estimated that better internet would help the typical rural hospital in Tennessee by about $150,000 a year. Researchers say that other factors play a much larger role, including a patient base that tends to need more care and has less ability to pay for it.

"['Abortion', 'Elections', 'North Carolina', 'BlueNC']","
Could this NC constitutional amendment make abortion illegal?
","This election, North Carolina voters will have the option of making six changes to the state Constitution. One of them, commonly referred to as the ""victims’ rights"" or ""Marsy’s Law"" amendment, would add more protections and rights for crime victims in the legal process. The amendment was pushed by an advocacy group, Marsy’s Law for All, founded to prevent situations like the one experienced by the family of Marsy Nicholas. Nicholas was stalked and killed by her ex-boyfriend in 1983, according to the Marsy’s Law for NC website. A week after Marsy’s death, her family was confronted by her accused murderer in a grocery store and the family ""had no idea that he had been released on bail,"" the site says. The proposed amendment would include granting victims’ families the constitutional right to be present at court proceedings of accused felons, the right to be informed of a jury’s ruling, and the right to know if the convicted perpetrator has escaped or been released from prison. Among the most common criticisms of the proposal is that it might slow the legal system and add costs. However, a completely different worry recently emerged on the BlueNC blog, which is run by former Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Protzman. Protzman created a poster describing each of the amendments. ""Victim’s rights will be extended to any class of people the legislature wants, including fetuses. This amendment will pave the way for making abortion illegal under North Carolina’s constitution,"" the Blue NC description of the victims’ rights amendment says. PolitiFact doesn’t often focus on blogs unless their content becomes widely distributed. In this case, the poster was shared on Facebook by Wayne Goodwin, chairman of the North Carolina Democratic Party, and Goodwin’s post was shared more than 700 times. ‘Who knows?’ Abortion is legal in the United States but regulations vary by state. For example, in North Carolina, there are restrictions on abortion after 20 weeks, and taxpayer money can’t be used for abortions except for pregnancies caused by rape, incest or where the mother’s life is endangered, according to the Guttmacher Institute, an advocacy group that promotes sexual and reproductive health and rights in the United States. North Carolina also gives medical providers the right to refuse abortion services and requires potential abortion patients to wait 72 hours after a consultation, the institute says. When contacted by PolitiFact, Protzman explained by email he’s critical of all six amendments because they’re vague. He pointed to this line in the legislation: ""The victim or, if the victim is a minor, is legally incapacitated, or deceased, a family member, guardian, or legal custodian may assert the rights provided in this section."" ""So let’s say you’re the estranged husband of a woman who has an abortion. Under this amendment, you could assert all the rights of a family member on behalf of the fetus, and then impose the requirements of the amendment on your estranged wife. You could even assert, on behalf of the ‘victim,’ that felony murder took place,"" Protzman said. ""Would this happen? Who knows? But it could. And given the willingness of Sen. Berger and Speaker Moore to bend legislative rules to suit their agendas, I wouldn’t bet against it,"" he added. But that hypothetical scenario is not only extremely unlikely, experts said, it’s also irrelevant. The victims’ rights amendment, which has no mention of abortion or reproductive rights, would still have no bearing on the legal status of abortion in North Carolina. ‘Absurd’ Gregory Wallace, a professor at Campbell University School of Law, noted the amendment applies only to people who are victims of a crime, and identifies specific procedures the court must follow to grant those rights. He described Protzman’s claim as ""absurd."" ""The proposed amendment does not authorize a person to accuse someone of a crime or to make something a crime that is not already unlawful,"" Wallace said in an email. ""Under the Constitution and current law, the aborted child is not treated as a victim of a crime,"" Wallace continued. ""The aborted child therefore would not have any rights under the proposed amendment, nor does the proposed amendment do anything to change current abortion law."" Marsy’s Law for NC, the group pushing the amendment, echoed that sentiment. ""Marsy’s Law is not about abortion rights — it’s about strengthening rights for victims of crime,"" the group said through Chris Sinclair, general consultant for the Marsy’s Law for NC campaign. ""Special interest groups are in high gear on social media spreading misinformation about Marsy’s Law, the amendment that will strengthen constitutional rights for victims of crime in North Carolina,"" the statement says. ""Their glib misinformation campaign is an attempt to mislead voters, and ultimately will hurt crime victims and their families who deserve equal rights in the state constitution - rights that the accused and convicted already have."" Skye David, an attorney with New Frame in Raleigh, focuses on victims of sexual assault as part of her lobbying work. She told PolitiFact in an email the proposed law could, in theory, apply to an abortion case. But it’s ""unlikely that it could qualify as felony murder because there would be no attempt to commit a felony under (statute)."" ""I’m certainly open to hearing how this could/would be more common, but don’t think that this would be a common or even uncommon case."" The proposal is unlikely to pave the way for making abortion illegal, she said. Federal law trumps state law John Dinan, an expert on the N.C. Constitution who teaches at Wake Forest University, says he has kept track of the states that started adopting victims’ rights amendments, a trend that started in the 1980s, and then the second wave of states that adopted Marsy’s Law amendments. ""Of the various critiques that have been advanced about these amendments during the campaigns — and there have been various critiques — concerns about the effects on abortion rights have not figured prominently in the debates and campaigns about the amendments,"" Dinan told PolitiFact in an email. ""Far more common have been concerns about whether these amendments will place an undue burden on prosecutors and court systems."" The proposed North Carolina constitutional amendment is no different, he said. ""In looking at the original victims’ rights amendment (added to the North Carolina Constitution in 1996) and then examining the changes that would be made by the 2018 Marsy’s Law amendment, it is not clear to me which of the 2018 changes would have the claimed effect on abortion rights,"" Dinan said. Jeff Powell, an expert at Duke University, emphasized that the state can’t pass any new abortion restrictions that violate federal law. And the Supreme Court has ruled that abortion rights are protected by the U.S. Constitution. ""As long as there’s a federal constitutional rule on abortion, that trumps whatever North Carolina will do,"" Powell said. Our ruling BlueNC said the proposed victims’ rights constitutional amendment will ""pave the way for making abortion illegal."" Attorneys and legal experts say the path to such fallout not only is unclear, but unlikely. One expert described the claim as ""absurd."" And Protzman failed to offer evidence that an amendment which is completely unrelated to reproductive rights could outlaw abortion.

Conservative group says Senate hopeful Leah Vukmir cost taxpayers $15,000 in open records fight
","The Club for Growth, a national conservative anti-tax group, released an attack ad against Republican U.S. Senate hopeful state Sen. Leah Vukmir. The video states that Vukmir: ""Claimed the open records law didn't apply to her, got sued, lost and cost taxpayers $15,000 in legal fees."" Vukmir on Aug. 14, 2018, emerged as the winner in the Republican U.S. Senate primary against Kevin Nicholson and will face Democrat Tammy Baldwin in the November election. There’s no doubt that Vukmir was sued in 2013. But does the ad really capture the whole story? Turns out, much of what the CFG claims in the ad launched in July is easily backed up by evidence in the 2013 case. Vukmir’s 2013 lawsuit The Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) sued Vukmir in 2013 for violating an open records request. At the time, Vukmir was second vice-chairwoman of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC). The conservative nonprofit is comprised of state legislators and members of the private sector. The CMD filed a request for records after an ALEC conference in Oklahoma City in May 2013. It resulted in the release of nine documents, but the CMD suspected there were more.  The CMD, a progressive watchdog organization based in Madison, was no stranger to requesting records from ALEC. They run a website called ALEC Exposed that targets the organization and its pro-corporation values. And Brendan Fischer, former lawyer for the CMD, said ALEC had been difficult with releasing records in the past. But one of the main reasons the CMD filed the lawsuit was due to a disclaimer that ALEC put at the bottom of their documents. The disclaimer stated: ""Because this is an internal ALEC document, ALEC believes that it is not subject to disclosure under any state Freedom of Information or Public Records Act."" Fischer said this made it difficult to believe they only had nine documents from the meeting.  The assumption proved correct during the settlement when both parties agreed to have Vukmir’s emails searched by an independent party in the presence of a staffer from the center. The independent party found a ""significant number"" of documents in Vukmir’s email. Later, Vukmir’s team released a statement, blaming the record mishap on technical difficulties. But did she resist by saying that the open records laws did not apply to her? Vukmir filed a motion in Dane County Circuit Court on Sept. 11, 2013, claiming she was immune from lawsuit while she held office. What Vukmir got wrong was that state law only specifies an exemption during the legislative session. She then tried to claim that the session included the entire term of a sitting legislator. The lawsuit, if Vukmir won, would have allowed all lawmakers to ignore the open records law, according to a report published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. But in the end, the case was settled before trial. Vukmir handed over the missing documents. Her legal team racked up $15,000 in fees, which was paid for by the state. Jess Ward, Vukmir’s campaign manager, did not address the case directly but said it is ""nothing more than an attempt by Leah’s opponents to attack her stellar record of saving taxpayers billions."" The campaign ad The claim about Vukmir’s lawsuit is the second made in the CFG Action video, after the statement that Vukmir sought leniency for a fellow lawmaker convicted of sexual assault. We rated that claim Mostly True. The group is backing conservatives in seven states during upcoming primaries but have spoken against Vukmir’s campaign. They openly endorsed Nicholson, Vukmir’s challenger in the U.S. senate race against incumbent Baldwin.   Our rating The cost of the case may not be the most out-of-the-ordinary part. It is standard practice for a politician to have their legal fees paid for by the state. But in Vukmir’s case, challenging open records laws could have changed the way all legislators respond to records requests. If she had won, legislators would be able to ignore open records law.  So, Vukmir did claim the open records laws did not apply to her. She was sued. And she did rack up $15,000 in legal fees. We rate this claim as True.  ",/factchecks/2018/aug/14/club-growth/did-leah-vukmir-cost-taxpayers-15000-legal-fees-af/

Fact-checking Kyrsten Sinema's claim about Medicare, Social Security
","In the Arizona race to replace outgoing Republican Sen. Jeff Flake, Democratic contender Rep. Kyrsten Sinema is pointing to her stance on Medicare and Social Security to separate herself from other candidates and win seniors’ votes. ""She understands that Medicare and Social Security aren’t line items in a budget for politicians to cut – they’re benefits Arizonans have earned through a lifetime of hard work,"" Sinema said on her campaign website. ""Kyrsten is committed to protecting benefits for current seniors and future generations, and she’s the only candidate for Senate who refuses to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the retirement age."" Arizona’s primary election is Aug. 28. Sinema is the Democratic frontrunner. The top Republican challengers are Rep. Martha McSally, former Arizona state senator Kelli Ward, and Joe Arpaio, the controversial Maricopa County sheriff pardoned by President Donald Trump. Is Sinema ""the only"" Arizona Senate candidate refusing to make cuts to Medicare, Social Security or to raise the retirement age? Sinema’s team in response to PolitiFact’s query narrowed down the claim to Sinema and McSally, saying they were the only two ""who have had to vote on entitlements"" and that the wording on Sinema’s website didn’t make a determination about ""what others may claim they will (or won’t) do."" While Sinema has a record of supporting Medicare and Social Security benefits, we found that her claim overplays the impact of some nonbinding measures voted on by her and McSally. Both lawmakers at times also voted the same way. McSally has generally been perceived as a moderate Republican (though she’s embraced a more conservative voice in the primary race), and Sinema bills herself as ""one of the most independent voices in Congress."" Sinema’s campaign pointed to McSally’s and Sinema’s voting record on motions and concurrent resolutions — although those votes did not directly stop or allow changes to Social Security, Medicare, or the retirement age. For instance, Sinema’s team pointed to a January 2017 concurrent resolution setting a budget blueprint for fiscal year 2017; Sinema voted against it, McSally for it. Its main purpose was to facilitate repeal of the Affordable Care Act. But the resolution did create the possibility of making changes to Medicare that could be interpreted as cuts, said Paul N. Van de Water, a senior fellow at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, where he specializes in Medicare, Social Security, and health coverage issues. Still, budget resolutions even if they pass do not become law; they lay out a plan. Budget resolutions also don’t affect Social Security — at least not directly — because there are rules against it, Van de Water said. Sinema’s team pointed to McSally and Sinema’s stance on transitioning Medicare to the Republican-favored ""premium support"" program, or ""vouchers"" as Democrats critically call it. Under the premium support/voucher system, beneficiaries would receive a payment to buy private insurance, or a traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan. A goal of switching over to the premium support/voucher approach is to reduce the growth in Medicare spending. Arguments against the switch include concerns that it would shift more costs to beneficiaries over time. Van de Water told PolitiFact that a premium support/voucher system would in most cases make traditional Medicare more expensive relative to the Medicare Advantage Plans (Medicare plans offered by a private company that contracts with Medicare). It’s fair to say that voting for a premium support/voucher system would be, at least in principle, a vote for cuts in Medicare, Van de Water said. McSally has cast votes for motions and resolutions that would support a premium support/voucher program or restructure Social Security, and raise the retirement age, Sinema’s team said, pointing to roll-calls and media reports. Sinema’s campaign also said that in 2013, Sinema and other lawmakers wrote to former President Barack Obama urging him to reject any budget proposal that would raise the retirement age or cut Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security benefits, specifically mentioning ""Chained CPI"" (an inflation adjustment measure). As PolitiFact Florida reported, a proposal to use chained CPI for inflation would not have lowered seniors’ Social Security checks, but their checks would have grown at a slower rate. The impact of the proposal would have depended upon the particulars in any separate legislation that became law, PolitiFact Florida found in a similar gubernatorial race fact-check. Sinema’s campaign also said McSally voted in favor of the tax cuts Trump signed into law late 2017 (Sinema voted against), saying they will lower Medicare and Social Security’s projected revenue. We’ve rated Half True claims linking the tax cuts to Medicare and Social Security’s future payments. The tax cuts are projected to increase the deficit, and some Republicans have called for entitlement reform to address it. Experts say that potential changes or ""cuts"" to Medicare and Social Security would not be just because of the tax cuts. The programs already are on an unsustainable trajectory. While it's common for a candidate to attack another for trying to do anything to bring the systems into balance, the bottom line is that either Congress will have to slow the growth of the program, raise taxes, or both. Asked about Sinema’s position to ensure the program's financial viability in the future, her campaign didn’t give specifics, saying only that Sinema ""believes we need to protect Medicare and Social Security benefits, weed out waste, fraud and abuse, and work together to ensure that the program is able to fulfill its long-term commitments to current and future retirees."" There are instances where McSally’s and Sinema’s votes aligned. Sinema in April 2015 voted for a motion instructing House conferees to agree with the Senate in preventing Medicare from becoming a ""voucher program,"" Sinema’s campaign said. The roll call shows McSally voted the same way. Both lawmakers in October 2017 also voted against a budget proposal that called for ""slashing trillions from domestic and foreign-affairs programs and entitlements including Medicare and Medicaid, repealing the Affordable Care Act and changing Social Security,"" Tucson.com reported. McSally’s campaign did not push back on Sinema’s claims about McSally’s record. Instead, it spotlighted Sinema’s own record. One example McSally’s campaign provided: Sinema in April 2018 voted in favor of a ""balanced-budget amendment,"" which House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi described as ""an act of breathtaking hypocrisy and an open assault on Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security,"" and one ""purpose-built to force devastating cuts in Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security.""   McSally also voted in favor of the proposal. It did not pass. While Sinema’s team said her website’s claim was only directed toward McSally, other candidates in the race, including Republicans Ward and Arpaio, told PolitiFact they opposed cuts to Medicare, Social Security, and raising the retirement age. Sinema’s Democratic opponent in the primary, civil rights attorney Deedra Abboud, also said she was against cuts to seniors’ benefits or raising the retirement age. Sinema on her campaign website said she is ""the only candidate for Senate who refuses to cut Medicare and Social Security or raise the retirement age."" The website’s claim is broad; Sinema’s team said McSally was its target. While some votes cast by McSally could have indirectly led to cuts in Medicare and a restructuring of Social Security, those votes were for not for measures that would have become law. They were for non-binding resolutions and motions. McSally’s and Sinema’s votes have aligned at times to protect entitlement programs — McSally has been considered a moderate Republican, and Sinema touts having an independent voice. In one instance, they both voted in favor of an amendment that Pelosi said would cut Medicare and Social Security.

No evidence to back Denham’s claim China ‘tampered’ with U.S. elections ‘quite a bit’
","California Congressman Jeff Denham recently called China’s tariffs ""a big deal"" for Central Valley farmers, especially the 50 percent tariff on almonds grown throughout his Stanislaus County district. A moment later, in the same interview on the 209 Podcast, the Republican claimed China is a big threat for another reason: Interfering in U.S. elections ""quite a bit."" ""China has been a good partner on a lot of issues. They’ve backed us up with North Korea. They are a good trading partner, even though they’ve not acted so well with our elections. They’ve tampered with our elections quite a bit,"" Denham said in the July 24, 2018 interview.  Denham makes his claim at the 15:00 minute mark in the video above.  Russia, not China, has been the focus of a U.S. investigation into election meddling since 2016. The Russian government, according to U.S. intelligence agencies, interfered in the 2016 presidential election through a widespread hacking and misinformation campaign. In their January 2017 report, the agencies said: ""We assess Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate Secretary Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency. We further assess Putin and the Russian government developed a clear preference for President-elect Trump. We have high confidence in these judgments."" Russia’s interference remains the focus of U.S. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s ongoing investigation. But we wanted to know whether there’s evidence showing China has ""tampered with our elections quite a bit,"" as Denham claimed. We decided to fact-check that very specific and serious charge. Background on Denham Denham is seeking his fifth term representing California’s 10th Congressional District. He is being challenged by Democrat Josh Harder, a college instructor and businessman. The race is considered one of four toss ups in California by the Cook Political Report. Denham sits on House committees on transportation, agriculture and natural resources, but doesn’t sit on any panels that would regularly discuss elections or foreign interference. His office did not say the claim comes from classified information. Similar claim rated False Denham’s statement that China has interfered in U.S. elections isn’t common. But there was one high-profile allegation fact-checked last year by PolitiFact Wisconsin. In July 2017, then White House chief-of-staff Reince Priebus said on ""Fox News Sunday"" that ""It’s an absolute fact"" that China and North Korea ""have consistently over many, many years"" meddled in U.S. elections. To assess that, PolitiFact Wisconsin contacted a dozen Asian studies and international affairs experts who either said they were unaware of any evidence to back Priebus’ claim or only aware of one example from two decades ago. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated Priebus’ claim False, a rating we’ll keep in mind. Still no evidence We contacted several of the same experts to find out whether any new information about China had come to light over the past year, since the recent fact check. Four experts responded and said there’s still nothing to support the claim that China has consistently interfered in U.S. elections. Like many other countries, China does try to influence the American political process, particularly through lobbying. That’s not the same, the experts said, as the pervasive Russian meddling in elections. ""I don’t think that there’s any evidence of China as a government acting to interfere in the elections in order to either disrupt the process or to tip the election one way or the other,"" said Yoshiko Herrera, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who has studied Russian election interference. Herrera is the former director of the school’s Center for Russia, East Europe and Central Asia. ""I see no indication from U.S. officials, from intelligence officials, that suggests China has been meddling in U.S. elections,"" added Robert Ross, political science professor at Boston College and associate at the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University. There’s little doubt that China has the technological ability to interfere in U.S. elections, Ross said. But its government is likely showing restraint in this arena, he said, because such action would draw negative attention from the U.S. and distract from China’s other goals, such as its military buildup in the South China Sea. ""I know of no evidence that China has tampered with US elections,"" Susan Shirk, a UC San Diego research professor and chair of the 21st Century China Center at the school, wrote in an email. ""China is increasing its efforts at public diplomacy/propaganda, to get people to have a positive view of China, but there are no reports of campaign contributions or meddling with the online information environment similar to those made about Russia."" Denham’s response Asked to support the statement, Denham’s spokeswoman Emily Carlin wrote in an email that China’s tampering in U.S. elections was ""commonly accepted facts."" She then rephrased what the congressman said, writing, ""As far as Chinese efforts to influence our political process, there has been increasing evidence of this."" She provided links to news articles from NPR, CNBC and CBS SF Bay Area, along with a U.S. intelligence report to support the claim. And while that material shows China poses a cyber and espionage threat and has run disinformation campaigns in Taiwan and Austrailia, it includes no claims China has interfered or tampered with U.S. elections. Alleged Chinese spy In her response, Denham’s spokeswoman cited news reports that a staffer who once worked for U.S. Senator Dianne Feinstein had a connection to Chinese spying. Victor Shih, an associate professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at UC San Diego, said, however, there’s no indication the staffer had any role in election interference. Shih said another matter from the 1990s, and not cited by Denham’s office, does show one ""clear case of China trying to influence elections."" In 1996, Johnny Chung, a Taiwanese-born California businessman, pleaded guilty to illegally funneling money from China to President Bill Clinton and the Democratic National Committee during Clinton’s re-election campaign. Chung later testified before Congress that the donations included $35,000 from the head of China's military intelligence agency to Clinton’s successful reelection effort. The FBI even warned six members of Congress at the time: ""We have reason to believe that the government of China may try to make contributions to members of Congress through Asian donors."" Shih and the other experts we contacted said, however, the Chung matter does not represent a widespread, persistent effort by China to interfere in U.S. elections. China is suspected, he added, of conducting a recent and broad political influence campaign in Australia. ""Meddling, of course, there are some cases of it (by China in the United States),"" Shih said. ""But to say that it’s pervasive or everywhere, I think it’s a bit of a stretch."" Citing Denham’s words, Herrera added that ""Tamper suggests … breaking into something or inappropriately changing something. It doesn’t just suggest buying influence, for example."" Our ruling Congressman Jeff Denham recently claimed China has ""tampered with our elections quite a bit."" Last year, PolitiFact Wisconsin surveyed a dozen international affairs experts to examine a similar claim and found no evidence China has conducted widespread election interference. It found one case in 1996 of illegal campaign contributions by a Taiwanese-born California businessman to Bill Clinton’s presidential campaign. The example, however, was not part of a sustained, pervasive election interference. Experts said they consider it an example of buying influence, but not comprehensive election tampering. We reached four experts to ask whether any information over the past year had changed their assessment. They told us there’s still nothing to support the charge that China has ""tampered with our elections quite a bit."" They added that China, like many countries, does attempt to influence America’s political process, mainly through lobbying, but does not have a record of election meddling anywhere approaching Russia’s. We rate Denham’s claim False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate. Click here for more on the six PolitiFact ratings and how we select facts to check. UPDATE:  After we published our fact check, Denham’s office provided additional news reports, contending ""there is significantly more of a case"" for the congressman’s claim than we showed in our fact check. The articles, which center on China’s alleged hacking of the Obama and McCain presidential campaigns in 2008, were not part of the congressman’s initial response. But we reviewed them and consulted several experts on China to evaluate whether they, in fact, make more of a case for Denham’s statement. Denham’s office pointed mainly to an NBC News investigation published in June 2013. It quoted Dennis Blair, President Obama’s director of national intelligence in 2009 and 2010, as saying: ""Based on everything I know, this was a case of political cyberespionage by the Chinese government against the two American political parties. They were looking for positions on China, surprises that might be rolled out by campaigns against China."" The NBC report added: ""The goal of the campaign intrusion, according to (U.S. Intelligence) officials: to export massive amounts of internal data from both campaigns—including internal position papers and private emails of key advisers in both camps."" Robert Ross of the Center for Chinese Studies at Harvard University told us in an email the 2008 hacking case ""does not show evidence of tampering in elections, but rather of an espionage campaign aimed at collecting intelligence on the likely US policies of US presidential candidates."" ""In this respect,"" he added, ""it is no different from any other intelligence collection effort. This was not tampering, but rather collection. There is a difference between such operations that must not be overlooked."" Ross said the difference is that tampering aims to influence political outcomes in the United States, while intelligence collection ""aims to improve the foreign policies of the state collecting the intelligence."" Additional experts said even if the 2008 case was considered ""tampering,"" they would still take issue with Denham’s characterization of China tampering with U.S. elections ""quite a bit."" ""Folks from the government may know more, but I have not seen any pervasive patterns,"" wrote Victor Shih, associate professor at the School of International Relations and Pacific Studies at UC San Diego. The additional information from Denham’s office supports the idea that China has conducted widespread intelligence collection to influence America’s political process.

After close Ohio special election, Trump falsely tweets that Kasich is unpopular
","President Donald Trump blamed Ohio Gov. John Kasich for the narrow win by Republican Troy Balderson in a special election. ""The very unpopular Governor of Ohio (and failed presidential candidate) @JohnKasich hurt Troy Balderson’s recent win by tamping down enthusiasm for an otherwise great candidate. Even Kasich’s Lt. Governor lost Gov. race because of his unpopularity. Credit to Troy on the BIG WIN!"" Trump tweeted Aug. 13. Kasich didn’t seem to agree. He responded on Twitter with a GIF of Vladimir Putin laughing. We will focus on Trump’s statement that Kasich is ""very unpopular,"" but we will also provide some context about Balderson’s close race in the special election for the Ohio 12th congressional district and Lt. Gov. Mary Taylor’s loss in the GOP primary to Attorney General Mike DeWine for governor. First, some background about the Aug. 7 special election to replace Republican U.S. Rep. Pat Tiberi, who resigned his seat representing suburban Columbus and nearby rural areas. Balderson, a state senator, has likely won the race, leading Democrat Danny O’Connor, a county recorder, by about 1 percentage point. Elections officials will begin the official canvass to count provisional and absentee ballots on Aug. 18 and certify the results by Aug. 24. No matter who wins, they are both running again in November. The close race drew national interest because in 2016 Trump won the district by 11 percentage points, and the district has largely been represented by Republicans for decades. Trump’s tweet followed Kasich’s appearance on Meet the Press, during which Kasich criticized the Trump team, saying, ""It wasn't a good night because this is a district that you should be winning by, you know, overwhelming numbers."" Kasich was first elected Ohio governor in 2010 and re-elected in 2014. He is term-limited and considering a challenge against Trump in 2020. In March 2011, Kasich’s favorability among the Ohioans was an abysmal 30 percent. But his popularity later increased. A compilation of recent polls show that Kasich has largely positive approval ratings. A Quinnipiac poll in June 2018 showed that 52 percent of Ohio voters approved of Kasich, while 36 percent disapproved, which translates to a plus-16 spread. But the poll showed that Kasich was doing better with Democrats than with his fellow Republicans -- Democrats approved of Kasich 57 - 33 percent. Republicans were divided, as 46 percent approve and 44 percent disapprove. Kasich has drawn support from some Democrats because he has criticized Trump and supported Medicaid expansion. University of Akron Professor David B. Cohen said Kasich remains quite popular in Ohio. ""It’s more than a bit ironic that President Trump is claiming that Gov. Kasich is unpopular since Trump is historically unpopular, has been throughout his entire presidency, and his disapproval numbers have been consistently higher than his approval ratings,"" Cohen said. In July, PolitiFact found that Trump was performing relatively worse compared with his contemporaries. However, Trump has fared well with Ohio Republicans. Herb Asher, political science professor emeritus at Ohio State University, said Kasich is viewed positively overall. ""But among a subset of Republicans -- the Trump loyalists -- he is not highly regarded,"" he said. Cedarville University political science professor Mark Caleb Smith said that the best indicator of Kasich's weakness in current Ohio politics is how no other Republicans are grabbing his moderate mantle statewide. ""In this narrow way, Trump's electoral influence is significant in the state,"" he said. ""Trump won Ohio handily in 2016's general election, though Kasich did defeat Trump in the Ohio Republican primary."" The White House did not respond to our emails. We aren’t rating Trump’s comments blaming Kasich for Balderson’s narrow win and Taylor’s loss. But Ohio political experts were skeptical about Trump’s statements. David Wasserman of the Cook Political Report found that Balderson probably owed his win to a late ad featuring Kasich, not a late rally by Trump. ""Balderson held onto a solid nine-point margin in wealthy suburban Delaware County, Kasich's base, where turnout was high,"" Wasserman wrote. ""But turnout was abysmally low in the district's most pro-Trump rural counties."" Experts generally told us that Kasich wasn’t to blame for Taylor’s loss in the primary for governor. Taylor, who ran on a Trumpian agenda, was viewed as the underdog in the GOP primary against the better-funded and more experienced DeWine. But Taylor distanced herself from Kasich, and he didn’t campaign for her. Trump said in a tweet that Kasich is ""very unpopular."" Polls have consistently shown that Kasich has had a positive approval rating for years. His current approval rating in Ohio is 52 percent approval, with 36 percent disapproval.

Is Josh Hawley the only state AG going after tech giants?
","Josh Hawley, the Republican state attorney general who is challenging incumbent Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill in November’s election, has gained a reputation  for taking on tech giants Google and Facebook. Last Nov. 13, Hawley announced that he was issuing an ""investigative subpoena"" to Google, as part of an investigation into whether the search-engine company has violated Missouri’s consumer-protection and antitrust laws.   Then, on April 2, he issued an ""investigative subpoena"" to Facebook, to look into how the social media company shares and tracks its users’ data. Earlier, he had launched investigations into app-based ride-sharing service Uber and credit bureau Equifax, according to his ""tech investigations"" web page. On several occasions recently, Hawley has portrayed himself as being unique among state attorneys general in this regard. ""I am the only (attorney general) in America fighting to hold the big tech companies accountable for their behavior,"" he said in a primary victory speech on Aug. 7, 2018. Hawley made similar assertions in two radio interviews. So is Hawley really alone among state attorneys general in holding tech companies accountable? The record shows that while Hawley has been notably active on tech issues, he is far from alone among attorneys general. For instance, more than 40 state attorney generals from both parties -- including Hawley -- signed a joint letter on March 26 to seek information from Facebook, following revelations that user information from Facebook profiles was provided to third parties without the users’ knowledge or consent. ""With the information we have now, our trust has been broken,"" the letter said. ""We appreciate the information you have provided to date and expect your full cooperation going forward in our inquiries into your business practices. To that end, we expect a full accounting for what transpired. …"" For years, ""attorneys general of both parties have been deeply involved in privacy prosecutions and other Internet-related matters,"" said James Tierney, the former attorney general of Maine who has taught about state attorneys general at both Columbia University and Harvard University. When we checked with Hawley’s campaign, they said he was referring to cases in which the office issued civil investigative demands, which is the equivalent to a subpoena from an attorney general’s office. However, we found a few other examples of current state attorneys general going that far against tech giants, or even further (by filing lawsuits). Here they are, in reverse chronological order: • Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson, a Democrat, filed suit against both Facebook and Google in June 2018 over their alleged failure to ""maintain legally required information for Washington state political advertising placed on their online platforms since 2013."" • West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey, a Republican, filed suit in April 2018 against Equifax, alleging that the company ""ignored warnings to secure its system"" and ""failed to safeguard consumer information,"" leading to a large data breach. • Pennsylvania Attorney General Josh Shapiro, a Democrat, sued Uber in March 2018 for violating Pennsylvania’s data breach notification law. • Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, served a civil investigative demand on Equifax over the data breach in November 2017. • Mississippi Attorney General Jim Hood, a Democrat, filed suit against Google in January 2017 over how the company ""maintains and uses data collected from Mississippi public school students who have Google’s G Suite For Education accounts."" • Earlier, in 2015, Hood subpoenaed Google over their search practices, and when the maneuver was blocked in court, 40 attorneys general -- 23 Republicans and 17 Democrats -- wrote a letter in support of Hood’s subpoena. In addition, the attorneys general of Massachusetts and New York have begun an investigation into Facebook over its data-sharing practices, including a ""demand letter"" sent on March 20, 2018. It’s worth noting that Hawley’s actions against Google and possibly Facebook are potentially broader in scope than the other lawsuits mentioned above. The other active lawsuits tend to be more narrowly framed around specific violations. Hawley has had a ""pioneering role in confronting ‘big tech’ over potential consumer protection and antitrust violations,"" said Kelli Ford, a spokeswoman for the Hawley campaign. Scott Cleland, the president of Precursor LLC, a consulting firm specializing in the Internet, agreed that Hawley’s actions stand apart from other attorneys general. Hawley ""is investigating Google broadly, and civil investigative demands are serious legal actions,"" Cleland said. Mark David Blafkin, founder and partner at Verge Strategies, a consulting firm that has advised Silicon Valley companies, said that civil investigative demands are not necessarily made public, so it would be ""tough to confirm how many others have been sent to tech firms."" Blafkin said that while the statement Hawley made is probably overly broad, he added that Hawley has shown himself to be one of the leaders among attorney generals in investigating the tech sector. Hawley said, ""I am the only (state attorney general) in America fighting to hold the big tech companies accountable for their behavior."" This is an exaggeration. His actions against Google and Facebook do have a particularly broad focus, but he is not alone in pursuing tech giants -- other attorneys general have also filed lawsuits against those and other companies during the past two years.

Yes, Rick Scott did cut $700 million from Florida’s water management districts
","Did Florida Gov. Rick Scott slash funding for the state’s water management oversight? That’s what a recent tweet by the Florida Democratic Party claimed. ""Rolled back safeguards and septic-tank inspections. Cut $700 million from water management. Appointed cronies who act on behalf of polluters. Banned the term ‘climate change.’"" ""This water crisis has a name, and it’s Rick Scott,"" it concludes. Scott, who is term-limited as governor, is challenging Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.  ☣️ Rolled back safeguards and septic-tank inspections☣️ Cut $700 million from water management☣️ Appointed cronies who act on behalf of polluters☣️ Banned the term ""climate change""This water crisis has a name, and it's Rick Scott. #FlaPol https://t.co/i1V93SWoge We’ve taken a look at some claims regarding Scott’s record on the environment before. With fears about algae blooms and red tide recently hitting the headlines, we were especially curious if Scott had actually ""cut $700 million from water management."" Scott did cut $700 million in funding from water management in 2011. He also implemented changes to how water management districts are funded that affect their finances in the long-term. Counting up the cuts  We began by reaching out to the Florida Democratic Party about its evidence for the claim. A party spokesperson sent us a 2018 Miami Herald column by Fabiola Santiago blaming Scott for dirty beaches, as well as a Palm Beach Post news article from 2011, near the end of Scott’s first year in office. That Palm Beach Post story begins with the line, ""The state's five water management districts have slashed their budgets by more than $700 million -- about 40 percent -- but Gov. Rick Scott, who initiated the cuts, wants a little more."" The state’s five districts have a variety of responsibilities, from water supply and quality management to flood and natural systems management. All five districts release their budgets on their websites annually. The districts release data for each financial year, which runs from Oct. 1 of the previous year to Sept. 30 of the named year. The first budgets that Scott had a say in came in the 2012 fiscal year, from Oct. 1, 2011, to Sept. 30, 2012. From the 2011 to 2012 fiscal years, the budgets of all five districts were cut across the board. The South Florida district suffered the most in cuts. Its FY 2011 budget was $1.07 billion while its FY 2012 budget was $576.1 million. That’s a reduction of $493.9 million, or 49 percent.   Meanwhile, the Southwest Florida district’s budget was slashed by $124.3 million in FY 2012. Combined with the $13.9 million, $35 million, and $14 million cuts to the budgets of the Suwannee River district, St. Johns River district, and Northwest Florida district, respectively, those numbers add up to just over the $700 million.   However, since 2012, the overall budget of the five districts has risen by almost $300 million. So the difference between pre-Scott cut budgets and the current budgets is now not $700 million, but rather closer to $400 million.  Whose responsibility is it, anyway? We reached out to Scott’s press secretary for comment. Lauren Schenone told PolitiFact, ""Water management districts independently create their own budgets. Their budgetary decisions, including tax and revenue collection, are ultimately made by the board of each water management district — not the governor, so they are completely wrong on this."" Districts do begin the budget process themselves by creating a preliminary budget independently of the governor. But their budgets pass through a complex adoption process. They need to eventually be approved by many groups, including the Florida Senate president, the Florida House speaker, and each water management district’s governing board, whose members are appointed by the governor. According to section 373.536(5)(a) of the Florida Statutes, the governor has the final say ""to approve or disapprove water management district budgets in whole or in part."" So if the governor doesn’t like a specific item in a district’s budget, he or she can veto it. Scott has claimed responsibility for the water management district budget cuts in the past, such as in this radio address from August 2011. ""I took action on the proposed budgets of Florida’s five water management districts,"" Scott said. ""All together, these budgets reflect a reduction of more than $700 million over last year."" Scott also restricted how much revenue districts could collect. A large part of district budgets comes from revenue collected through property taxes. In 2011, Scott signed a bill into law that placed a limit on the maximum amount of property tax the districts could levy. That bill lowered district property tax revenues by 30 percent, or $210 million. ""Those (property tax) revenues have not been restored to their pre-Gov. Scott levels,"" said Aliki Moncrief, executive director of Florida Conservation Voters. ""Assuming the taxable value of Florida property stayed the same from 2011-2019, we are talking about at least $1.7 billion in lost revenue for water management districts (over the course of eight years)."" Scott took responsibility for those revenue cuts, too. In a June 2011 press release, he said, ""This property tax cut allows families and businesses to use more of their hard-earned money in the way they see best, rather than having to send it to a government agency."" Our ruling The Florida Democratic Party tweeted that Scott ""cut $700 million from water management."" The budgets of Florida’s five water management districts were collectively cut by over $700 million about a year into Scott’s first term. Since the governor has the final say over the water management districts’ budgets, the tweet is largely accurate. However, in the years since 2012, the districts’ budgets have started to rise again. The overall budget of the five districts is no longer $700 million less than the pre-Scott budget. We rate this statement Mostly True.

In Ohio TV ad, Republican group misleads in attack on Richard Cordray's tenure at consumer bureau
","A Republican group says that when Richard Cordray worked for the federal government, he collected Americans’ financial data in secret and then the data was hacked. ""Cordray was supposed to protect Americans from financial crime,"" says a TV ad by the Republican Governors Association in Ohio. ""Instead, Cordray secretly collected hundreds of millions of credit card accounts and mortgages. Worse, Cordray failed to protect our information. It was hacked over 200 times. Your data compromised."" The ad makes it sound like Cordray collected information on his own initiative, but it’s actually referring to Cordray’s role in the federal government as the first director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, formed under President Barack Obama over the objections of Republicans. It’s misleading to state that Cordray collected data in secret because the law allowed data collection. It’s also misleading to suggest that there was a hack, which implies an outsider broke into the data. However, there was a security breach. We’ll explain the full context. Cordray left his job at the consumer bureau in 2017, and Mick Mulvaney, a critic of the bureau, took over. Cordray is now running for Ohio governor against Republican Attorney General Mike DeWine. The 2010 Dodd-Frank Act created the bureau and gave it authority to gather and compile information from a variety of sources, such as consumer complaints, voluntary surveys, surveys and  interviews with consumers and financial service providers, and reviews of available databases. The law also contained privacy provisions. We found examples dating back to 2010 of supporters and opponents commenting on the data collection. In an article in Bank Technology News, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., praised the idea of essential ""real-time data collection"" so that the bureau could be an ""effective cop."" An editorial in the Orange County Register quoted an expert who raised concerns about the bureau’s plans to collect data on consumers transactions. A federal Government Accountability Report in 2014 discussed in detail how the bureau collected data from financial institutions and financial aggregators. Jeff Sovern, who teaches consumer protection law at St. John’s University, said it would be hard to collect information about the functioning of consumer financial markets without seeing information about credit cards and mortgages. ""The bureau was established in part to keep the mortgage lending that led to the Great Recession from happening again, after all,"" he said. The ad contained no citations for its point, although association spokesman Jon Thompson sent us news articles pertaining to both. Thompson pointed to Cordray’s testimony Jan. 28, 2014, before a House committee. U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., asked Cordray: ""Would you object to getting permission from consumers, those people who you work for, before you collect and monitor their information?"" Cordray said if the bureau had to get individuals’ permission before it sought aggregate data about the credit card market, that  ""would have the purpose of completely making it impossible for the agency to have any kind of data to know what's going on in these markets."" Todd J. Zywicki, a George Mason University law professor and critic of the bureau under Cordray, said that most Americans don’t know that their private information is transmitted from banks to the government. ""In that sense, ‘secret’ seems like an accurate term to me,"" he said. (News reports said that the Trump administration considered Zywicki to take over the bureau.) As for the claim that the information was hacked, the RGA pointed to Mulvaney’s response to a question during an April 12, 2018, Senate committee if the data had been hacked. Mulvaney replied: ""I want to be careful about what I say and I'll be happy to talk about this more in private, but we have been able to document about 240 lapses in our data security."" Mulvaney said an additional 800 lapses were suspected but hadn’t been confirmed. Mulvaney provided similar information in January in a letter to Warren stating that before his tenure there were 233 confirmed breaches of personally identifiable information within the bureau’s consumer response system by the bureau or contractors. To put that number in context, the consumer bureau has handled more than one million complaints. (A spokesman for the bureau provided PolitiFact with the letter sent to Warren but declined to answer questions.) Mulvaney told senators he instituted a data collection freeze and had hired an outside party to test the integrity of the system. On May 31, Mulvaney told his staff in an email that ""after an exhaustive review by outside experts, including a comprehensive ‘white-hat hacking’ effort, we can lift that hold. The independent review concluded that ‘externally facing bureau systems appear to be well-secured.’"" Zywicki said that the use of the term ""hack"" in the ad is not correct. ""There have been hundreds of compromises of consumer information, but mainly they have been by inadvertently disclosing personally identifiable information by the contractors who collect the information that gets dumped into the consumer complaint database,"" he said. A Republican Governors Association ad said that Richard Cordray ""secretly collected hundreds of millions of credit card accounts and mortgages. Worse, Cordray failed to protect our information. It was hacked over 200 times."" It’s misleading to state that the data was collected in secret when the law that established that the bureau could collect data to protect consumers. If some consumers didn’t realize the data would be collected, that doesn’t mean it was a secret. The use of the word ""hack"" is the wrong term -- it implies some nefarious person hacked into the data, and that’s not the case. There were breaches of personal information by the bureau or contractors.

Do players get most of NFL revenues, as Donald Trump says?
","  President Donald Trump took another shot at the National Football League, the latest in his ongoing Twitter war against the NFL over some players taking a knee during the National Anthem to protest police mistreatment of African-Americans. On Aug. 10, Trump tweeted, "".....Be happy, be cool! A football game, that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy, is no place to protest. Most of that money goes to the players anyway. Find another way to protest. Stand proudly for your National Anthem or be Suspended Without Pay!"" .....Be happy, be cool! A football game, that fans are paying soooo much money to watch and enjoy, is no place to protest. Most of that money goes to the players anyway. Find another way to protest. Stand proudly for your National Anthem or be Suspended Without Pay! Is it true that ""most of that money goes to the players,"" as Trump said? As it turns out, players do not make most of the money, although the players’ percentage is not far below 50 percent. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The revenue split between the players and the owners is negotiated through a collective bargaining agreement. The current agreement was negotiated in 2011, and it will be in force through 2021. According to the NFL summary of the current agreement, the ""player share must average at least 47 percent for the 10-year term of the agreement."" When we checked with the NFL Players Association, the players’ union, they confirmed that the current players’ share is 48.5 percent of all league revenue, including local revenue and media deals. Spokeswoman Erin Hayes added that the percentage ""fluctuates between 47 percent and 48.5 percent, but right now it’s 48.5 percent."" (The NFL did not respond to inquiries.) The NFL doesn’t release overall financial data, but media reports have estimated what the league’s 32 teams make by using data released by the Green Bay Packers, a publicly owned team that is required to release financial information annually. In 2017, the NFL ownership kept a little more than $8 billion in revenue for themselves, while the players took a little less than $8 billion, according to such accounts. The owners’ share was up by 4.9 percent, a rise largely attributed to a new, more generous contract for Thursday Night Football broadcasts. This is a substantial percentage, but it doesn’t meet even the most generous definition of ""most,"" which would be anything higher than 50 percent. Trump’s statement ""is wrong. Players do not receive most of the money,"" said David Berri, a Southern Utah University economist and a past president of the North American Association of Sports Economics. Daniel Kaplan, who covers the NFL for SportsBusiness Journal and SportsBusiness Daily, agreed that Trump’s assertion is incorrect and even suggested that the 47 percent figure may be high. Kaplan has previously written that the NFL’s revenue figures ""are incomplete, as the league does not share every penny with the players, shielding hundreds of millions of dollars in areas such as stadium finance."" Trump said, ""Most of that money (made by the NFL) goes to the players."" According to the collective bargaining agreement now in force, the players are getting 48.5 percent of revenues, a number that can’t average less than 47 percent in the 10-year life of the agreement. That’s not peanuts, but it doesn’t meet even the most generous definition of ""most.""
