Trump miscasts impact on trade of Chinese taxes
","Donald Trump loves to tell voters he’s all about getting a better deal for America. It’s a theme he invokes repeatedly when it comes to trade. In a recent interview with two New York Times reporters, Trump called for a different mind set. ""I do know my subject, and I do know that our country cannot continue to do what it’s doing,"" Trump said. ""It’s very hard for us to do business in China, it’s very easy for China to do business with us. Plus with us, there’s a tremendous tax that we pay when we go into China, whereas when China sells to us, there’s no tax. I mean, it’s a whole double standard."" We wondered, is there a hefty tax when American firms sell in China, while there’s no tax that Chinese firms face when they sell here? We asked the Trump campaign for background information on this and didn’t hear back. The trade experts we reached told us there two possible ways to interpret what Trump means by a ""tax that we pay when we go into China."" He might have meant China’s value-added tax, or VAT, or he might have meant China’s import tariffs. We’ll explore both. Value Added Tax This tax is collected at each stage in the production or distribution of a product or service, but with a refund mechanism for VAT paid on purchased units so the final burden falls on the final buyer or consumer. So for example, when a clothing wholesaler sells some shirts to a retailer, the tax is booked on the wholesaler’s mark-up. When the retailer sells the shirt to a customer, the tax is booked again. But the retailer gets a credit back for the tax paid by the wholesaler. China, along with about 160 other countries including Euro Zone members, has a VAT. The United States does not. China’s basic VAT is 17 percent, but some items, such as agricultural products, are not taxed at all, and some products face a lower rate of 13 percent. So in terms of a VAT, Trump has a point. But it isn’t one that has to do with a tax that uniquely raises the price of American goods and services sold in China. By and large, the VAT applies to all sales, regardless of where the product was made. It raises the costs for everybody. ""VAT or not doesn’t make much difference,"" said John Graham, a professor of international business at the UC Irvine Paul Merage School of Business. An analysis of challenges in U.S.-China trade relations by the Congressional Research Service, the policy think tank of Congress, makes no mention of China’s value-added tax. The Office of U.S. Trade Representative’s 2015 report on China does mention China’s VAT, but only in the way the government used VAT rebates to reduce costs for Chinese exporters. ""These practices have caused tremendous disruption, uncertainty, and unfairness in the global markets for some products,"" the report says, especially for products where China is a leading world producer, such as steel, aluminum and soda ash. While that allows Chinese manufacturers to sell more cheaply overseas, it doesn’t make it more expensive for any foreign company to compete for sales in China. For the record, it is worth putting China’s VAT into context. With one exception, countries in the European Union charge a higher rate. Luxembourg’s is the same as China’s, but Germany’s is 19 percent, France’s is 20 percent and Italy’s is 22 percent. Tariffs Tariffs are essentially a tax on imports. On this front, China imposes higher rates than does the United States. Here’s how it breaks down, according to the World Trade Organization:   Agricultural Products Non-Agricultural Products US tariffs on Chinese goods sold in the United States 2.5% 2.9% Chinese tariffs on U.S. goods sold in China 9.7% 5.0%   There are different ways to summarize tariffs. The table above is adjusted for the volume of trade of different goods in each broad category, but regardless of how you cut it, China has higher tariffs than the United States. However, Trump said Chinese goods faced no tax in the United States. That’s inaccurate. For agricultural goods, the tax is 2.5 percent. For non-agricultural goods, it is 2.9 percent. ""If Trump was referring to tariffs, which are a kind of tax, then it is clearly incorrect that Chinese products come into the U.S. tariff-free,"" said Joel Trachtman, a trade law specialist at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. It’s also worth noting that as a member of the World Trade Organization, China treats all importers the same, except if it has a separate free-trade deal. So, all things being equal, every WTO trading partner pays the same import tariff as the United States. China does have a number of free-trade treaties with many Asian countries, plus ones with Australia, Chile and others. Julia Ya Qin, professor of law at Wayne State University, told us that it’s not unusual for the United States to have lower rates than China. ""Industrialized countries generally have lower tariffs than developing countries,"" Qin said. ""Hence, countries such as India, Turkey, Argentina have much higher average tariffs than the United States, the EU, Canada, Japan on industrial products. China is somewhere in between the two groups."" Overall, while the United States and others have had trade disputes with China, they don’t hinge on tariffs or taxes. ""Generally, they are not major problems even in most cases worldwide,"" said Stuart Malawer, professor of law and international trade at George Mason University. Malawer served on the Virginia governor’s trade mission to China. ""The real problem are non-tariff barriers. China has a significant number of them. These are primarily regulatory."" A leading example on the regulatory side has to do with beef. In 2014, China used food safety rules to block beef imports. Malawer reviewed the history of trade disputes between the United States and China and told us that tariffs and taxes ""are not an issue between the U.S. and China."" Our ruling Trump said ""there’s a tremendous tax that we pay when we go into China, whereas when China sells to us, there’s no tax."" If Trump was thinking of China’s value-added tax, he has something of a point. China has a basic VAT of 17 percent, while the United States has none. However, the VAT applies to most goods sold in China, regardless of where they are made. And the VAT affects domestic producers the same as foreign ones. If Trump was thinking of import tariffs, he has a different problem. Yes, China’s tariffs are higher than those imposed by the United States, but the Chinese exporters do face a tax when they sell in this country. So in terms of tariffs, Trump is wrong. No expert or report we found from impartial sources suggested that taxes of any sort presented a challenge to American firms that sell in China. There are problems, but they stem from other things China does. Whatever tax or tariff Trump had in mind, he either exaggerated the impact on trade or got the U.S. rate wrong. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A36EEC0>],/factchecks/2016/mar/30/donald-trump/trump-miscasts-impact-trade-chinese-taxes/

Donald Trump wrong about Wisconsin's 'effective' unemployment rate being 20 percent
","At a campaign rally in Wisconsin on March 29, 2016, Donald Trump took aim at Gov. Scott Walker and -- reading from notes that he said came from ""books"" -- made a number of statistical claims that reflect negatively on the state. The Republican frontrunner for president cast blame on the Republican governor and onetime presidential candidate, citing figures on state government debt and the number of people on food stamps. But one of Trump’s most striking claims was about unemployment -- something Walker frequently takes credit for having brought down. ""Unemployment rate -- well, they say -- that can't be possible,"" Trump told a crowd in Janesville, looking at his notes. ""Unemployment rate, they have down 20, that can't be possible."" As members of the audience interjected, Trump continued by saying: ""What? Is it 20 percent? Effective or regular? I mean just -- effective unemployment rate, 20 percent. Hey, this is out of the big book."" So, is Wisconsin’s ""effective"" unemployment rate 20 percent? The measures There is no official measure for the effective -- or as Trump on other occasions called it -- the ""real"" unemployment rate. But even taking into account the federal government’s most expansive measure of unemployment, Wisconsin’s rate doesn’t even reach double digits. Here’s what the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics told us: BLS has six measures of unemployment, ranging from U-1 -- the most restrictive -- to U-6 -- the most expansive. In between is U-3, the official unemployment rate. That’s the one you see reported in the news most often. The U-3 official unemployment rate in Wisconsin was 4.6 percent in 2015. That rate is updated monthly. The most recent rate, for February 2016, was also 4.6 percent. The U-6 rate, meanwhile, is sometimes referred to unofficially as the ""real"" unemployment rate. U-6 includes people who are unemployed, plus ""marginally attached workers,"" meaning those who are not in the labor force but want to work and are available for work. It also includes people who want to work full time but, because of economic conditions in their area, are able to work only part time. The U-6 rate is calculated only annually. Wisconsin’s U-6 rate for 2015 was 8.3 percent -- again, far below Trump’s 20 percent. Trump made a similar claim in June 2015 in announcing his run for president. He said the ""real"" unemployment rate for the United States at the time was ""anywhere from 18 to 20 percent. Don't believe the 5.6. Don't believe it."" (At the time, the official unemployment rate nationally was 5.5 percent.) PolitiFact National rated that statement False, citing U-6 figures as we've cited. Trump’s campaign staff didn’t respond for that fact check and, as of press time on this fact-check, had not responded to our requests for information. Our rating Trump said Wisconsin’s ""effective"" unemployment rate is 20 percent. Wisconsin’s latest official unemployment rate -- the one reported most often in the news -- was 4.6 percent in February 2016. It was also 4.6 percent for all of 2015. The government’s most expansive unemployment rate -- which includes the unemployed, people in the labor force who aren’t looking for work and people who are working part time but want to work full time -- for Wisconsin was 8.3 percent for 2015. We rate Trump’s statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C17DF40>],/factchecks/2016/mar/30/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrong-about-wisconsins-effective-unem/

Debbie Wasserman Schultz attacked for bank donations and position on payday loan bill
","A law professor running against U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of South Florida says she is in the pocket of big banks and isn’t looking out for consumers who get crushed by debt from payday loans. ""My opponent, after taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, has voted to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFTP) from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans,"" said Tim Canova on his website. Canova, a first-time candidate and professor at Nova Southeastern University, is challenging Wasserman Schultz in the August Democratic primary in a Broward/Miami-Dade district. The race has drawn national attention because Wasserman Schultz is the Democratic National Committee chair. Did Canova accurately describe her donations from banks and her votes related to payday loans and car loans? There is some truth to his attack, but each one requires explanation. Donations from Wall Street banks Canova’s campaign pointed to donations from banks, securities/investment firms and finance/credit companies to Wasserman Schultz’s campaign committee and her political action committee, or PAC. At PolitiFact Florida’s request, the Center for Responsive Politics compiled the large individual donations (more than $200) and donations to her PAC starting with her 2006 election. The center found she received $309,020 from commercial banks, which represented about 2 percent of the total; $408,450 from securities/investment firms, and $325,850 from finance/credit companies. Her leadership PAC, Democrats Win Seats, received donations from the Goldman Sachs PAC: $5,000 in 2016 and $10,000 in 2014. Wasserman Schultz spokesman Sean Bartlett pointed to donations only to her campaign and plucked out what he said were the ""big bank"" donations. That totaled $15,400, including $4,000 from Goldman Sachs. But the Center for Responsive Politics shows a longer list of bank donations even if we only examine her campaign committee. It shows $171,303 for ""commercial bank"" industry donations. Payday loan bill Payday loans are small, short-term loans that borrowers promise to repay out of their next paycheck at a high rate of interest. It is a controversial industry that targets the poor and is disproportionately located in minority communities. For years, payday loans were unregulated by the federal government, although some states had their own laws. President Barack Obama took a step toward regulating the industry when he signed a bill in 2010 that included the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. Republicans have targeted the bureau for years. Enter some Democrats into the fray -- including Wasserman Schultz, who has gotten about $68,000 from payday lenders, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Wasserman Schultz is among Florida lawmakers who have defended Florida’s payday law despite the fact that some consumer advocates have bashed it and say it traps the poor in a debt cycle. Wasserman Schultz’s position is to give precedence to the state law, her spokesman said. On the federal level, the bureau released an outline of payday loan rules in March 2015 and is expected to announce a more complete proposal within the next several months. Congress doesn’t have to approve it but can introduce legislation to kill it. All but one member of Florida’s congressional delegation (Tom Rooney) signed a letter in April 2015 pushing back against the proposed rules. Instead, they want the bureau to look at Florida’s law as a model. That led U.S. Rep. Dennis Ross, a Florida Republican, to file the ""Consumer Protection and Choice Act,"" H.R. 4018 in November. Half of the 24 cosponsors are from Florida, including Wasserman Schultz, and nine of the cosponsors are Democrats. Canova’s website said Wasserman Schultz ""voted"" on the bill, but it was only referred to a committee without a vote. (After we pointed that out to Canova senior adviser Richard Bell, the campaign changed the website to say ""co-sponsored"" instead of ""voted."") The bill states that if the bureau determines that a state’s law meets the federal requirements, then only state law will apply. It would also delay federal regulations for two years, which would allow states to come up with their own laws. More than 200 consumer or civil rights groups -- including the NAACP, National Council of La Raza, Southern Poverty Law Center and the Consumer Federation of America -- wrote a letter to Congress urging them to defeat the bill. They argued that the bill favors an ""industry-backed Florida law"" and would hurt consumers. Florida’s 2001 payday loan law was a compromise and included protections that were intended to help the poor avoid an endless cycle of debt. But the loans leave consumers stuck on a debt treadmill in Florida, where they have racked up $2.5 billion in fees since 2005, according to the Center for Responsible Lending’s March report. In the past year, the average Florida payday loan had an annual rate of 278 percent. Richard Cordray, head of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, disputed Ross’ description of Florida’s law as the ""gold standard"" during a congressional hearing on March 16. In Florida, ""these loans are still being made above the 300 percent, and they are being rolled over on average nine times,"" Cordray said. Bartlett argued that Wasserman Schultz has fought against ""abusive payday lending practices"" and pointed to her vote on a separate bill in 2015. She voted against HR 766, the Financial Institution Customer Protection Act, which opponents argued would have prevented the Justice Department from going after the financial industry. Racial discrimination in car loans Canova also said Wasserman Schultz prevented action to stop racial discrimination for car loans. This part of Canova’s attack relates to a 2013 bulletin from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which recommended steps for auto lenders to avoid discrimination. The bulletin was intended to provide clarity about existing law. But the House of Representatives pushed back against the bureau by passing a bill to nullify the bulletin. The bill passed the House 332-96 in November 2015 and hasn’t had a vote in the Senate. Wasserman Schultz was one of 88 Democrats who voted in favor of it, while 96 Democrats opposed it. Proponents of the bill -- including auto dealers -- said the bureau’s efforts would increase costs for consumers. Groups that represented minorities wanted the new guidelines. ""This legislation in no way prevented the CFPB from addressing racial discrimination in car loans, and the congresswoman does not support that as a policy position,"" her spokesman said. The bill hasn’t been acted on, and discrimination investigations can continue. A few months after the House vote, Toyota agreed to a $21.9 million settlement to black and Asian buyers. Our ruling Canova says Wasserman Schultz ""after taking hundreds of thousands of dollars from Goldman Sachs and other Wall Street banks, has voted to prevent the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau from regulating payday loans and addressing racial discrimination in car loans."" Her campaign committee and PAC have taken $309,020 from commercial banks since her re-election campaign in 2006 -- about 2 percent of the total. That includes $15,000 in donations from Goldman Sachs to her leadership PAC. The payday loan bill hasn’t had a vote in the House yet, although Wasserman Schultz is a co-sponsor. The bill would not prevent the bureau from regulating payday loans entirely, but it would cede power to the states, including Florida, which has its own payday law that some advocates have criticized as weak. She voted for a bill that squashed bureau guidelines that were intended to provide clarity about the law on racial discrimination related to car loans.

Evidence backs Hillary Clinton claim that torture is counterproductive for counterterrorism
","The day after the March 22 terrorist attack in Brussels, former Secretary of State and Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton gave a speech at Stanford University talking about ISIS, the threat of terrorism and whether torture is a useful tool to fight it. ""One thing we know that does not work is offensive, inflammatory rhetoric that demonizes all Muslims,"" she said, adding, ""Another thing we know that does not work, based on lots of empirical evidence, is torture."" ""Many intelligence, military and law enforcement experts have attested to this fact. It also puts our own troops and increasingly our own civilians at greater risk,"" Clinton said. Most of us can see ourselves spilling the beans on anything and everything if we were subjected to the kinds of ""enhanced interrogation techniques"" that suspected terrorists have been subjected to by the United States since 9/11. We wondered if, as Clinton contended, it has been well established that torture does not work. Tell them what they want to hear Because nobody's going to volunteer to be part of a scientific study where you might get tortured — ethics review boards might be apoplectic about such a proposal — the only way to examine the issue is through case studies. The experts with whom we spoke said that, for a host of reasons, torture has long been recognized as an inefficient way to get information. The biggest problem is that it tends to produce wrong information. The United States Army Field Manual warns that information gathered by torture can be faulty. That's because, during torture, truth becomes irrelevant. And when the interrogators don't know if the information is true, the torture may continue even if the detainee tells the truth. At that point, the captive will fabricate information with the goal of telling the interrogator what he wants to hear. ""It is enormously well documented (including by the Senate study of the CIA program) that torture generated enormous amounts of false statements,"" said Lisa Hajjar, a professor at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who studies torture. (More about the Senate study in a bit.) One example was the case of Abu Zubaydah, initially billed by the Bush administration as al-Qaida's chief of operations. Waterboarded 83 times, he told tales of planned attacks on shopping malls, nuclear power plants and the Brooklyn Bridge. Critics say that's because he knew little. Joining al-Qaida after 9/11, he scheduled people to move in and out of training camps and was mentally challenged. Before the invasion of Iraq, the Bush administration said it had ""information that Iraq had been training al-Qaida operatives in the use of chemical weapons, thus connecting Iraq to 9/11,"" said Hajjar in a review article in the Annual Review of Law and Social Science. ""This information was extracted by torture from a Libyan prisoner, Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi, who subsequently recanted the lies he had told interrogators to make the pain stop."" Bad truth detectors Interrogators aren’t particularly good at telling when someone under torture is lying or telling the truth. ""Interrogators in these situations think they're perfect lie detectors but research tells us quite differently,"" said Darius Rejali, a torture expert at Reed College in Oregon. Special training programs designed to enhance that ability ""make the interrogators more confident that they can detect the truth, but in fact they would be better off flipping a coin."" In the current war on terror, consider the case of Hassan Ghul. After his capture, he was cooperative without being tortured and provided information key to finding Osama bin Laden through bin Laden's associate, Abu Ahmad al-Kuwaiti. But after he cooperated, the CIA decided to torture Ghul anyway. It produced no useful additional intelligence. ""The people who do know something will lie whether you torture them or not. The problem comes when you pull people in who don't know anything, and they're claiming that they do,"" said Rejali. That opens the door to all kinds of fanciful intelligence from crazed-from-torture informants. ""Sleep deprivation will make you imagine you were there shooting (President John) Kennedy behind the grassy knoll,"" said Rejali. Another issue is that news reports of torture turn public opinion against authorities who condone or permit torture. Rejali cited the cases of a 2005 bombing attempt in London. When video of the bomber aired, ""the parents came forward and said, 'He's our son. He's the killer.' Would the parents have come forward if they knew their son was going to be tortured? You can be fairly certain the answer to that is no."" ""Not only does torture undermine what we know works, which is public cooperation, but it can also deeply alter the duration, severity and cost of a conflict,"" he said. ""Torture alienates societies needed for war efforts,"" said Hajjar. Senate torture report When we contacted the Clinton campaign, spokesman Josh Schwerin directed us to the report by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, released when Democrats controlled the Senate. The full document, about 6,700 pages and approved in 2012, remains classified. A 525-page redacted executive summary was released in December 2014. There's also a minority report developed by Republicans on the committee and a CIA response. The majority report says techniques such as waterboarding, standing sleep deprivation, forced feeding through a rectal tube, temperature extremes and confinement in coffin-sized boxes were not effective for getting intelligence from people detained after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The committee's analysis of 20 prominent cases that reportedly ""saved lives"" — cited by the CIA and the Bush administration — found either that the key information was gathered before torture began, the information was already available to the intelligence community before the enhanced techniques were initiated, or there was no relationship between those success stories and the information provided by the detainees. For example, the majority report says that ""CIA records reveal that 34 percent of the 119 known CIA detainees produced no intelligence reports."" Another example: The CIA said Ghul, the detainee who gave information that eventually led to the location of bin Laden, had been subjected to harsh interrogation and had produced valuable information. The agency neglected to mention that the information came before Ghul was subjected to enhanced interrogation. Other instances where the Bush administration said enhanced interrogation — described by the president as tough, safe, lawful and necessary — produced valuable intelligence have also been debunked. The minority report says that in many of the 20 cases, enhanced interrogation tactics did produce significant breakthroughs, although sometimes as part of a delayed cascade effect. The problem with most of the accounts of people who say that torture works, said Rejali, is that only the cases where it seemed to succeed are remembered and the ones where it didn't are forgotten. ""In the two and a half years following the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. intelligence agencies arrested more that 5,000 suspected terrorists,"" said Mark Costanzo of Claremont McKenna College and Ellen Gerrity of Duke University, writing in the journal Social Issues and Policy Review. ""There was sufficient hard evidence to bring formal charges against only three of these suspects, and only one of these three was convicted."" Our ruling Clinton said that when it comes to fighting terrorism, ""Another thing we know that does not work, based on lots of empirical evidence, is torture."" When it comes to the real goal of getting useful intelligence, the preponderance of the evidence shows that the details interrogators will get from a detainee can typically be acquired without torture. When torture is used, the ""information"" extracted is likely to be fiction created by a prisoner who will say anything to get the punishment to stop. All ethical issues aside, the experts say, it doesn't work because it is extremely inefficient and, in many ways, counterproductive. We rate the claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFEAA80>],/factchecks/2016/mar/30/hillary-clinton/evidence-backs-hillary-clinton-claim-torture-count/

'Big Soda' and the profits Mayor Kenney is convinced it earns
","Philadelphia Mayor Jim Kenney’s justification for his proposed sugary drinks tax: soda companies still bring in considerable profits, he says. ""Big soda has a lot of money,"" the mayor argued in an interview with KYW. ""They make a lot of profit off their product and they market in neighborhoods that suffer from these very things that we’re trying to cure."" Billy Penn has covered how low-income consumers drink more sugary beverages than higher income ones. Advertising is more heavily featured in poor neighborhoods of color, research has shown. So, we decided to look into Kenney’s comment on profits. In the last decade, soda sales have fallen dramatically. In 2014 in the U.S., Coca Cola and Pepsi together sold 1.4 billion cases fewer than they did in 2004, Fortune reported, the sum of ""modest declines"" for 10 years straight. The Philadelphia Inquirer detailed that Coca Cola in particular had lost $1 billion in sales each year since 2012. These drops have meant big changes for Big Soda: Investing in foreign markets, implementing cost-cutting measures, bottling drinks in smaller sizes too for higher profit margins or raising prices altogether, to name a few. Beverage Digest Editor Duane Stanford highlighted price hikes in an interview. ""Companies have increased prices for their products, so they’ve been making money even though they’re selling fewer beverages,"" he said. But! ""Soft drinks are still profitable,"" he continued. Soda corporations ""still have pricing power because their brands are powerful."" Judging how big profits have been is ""entirely dependent on the company themselves,"" said Stanford. ""It’s a relative statement."" Big soda to some commentators refers to the carbonated drinks industry as a whole. To others, it speaks to the biggest soft-drink selling corporations in the game: Coca Cola, Pepsi and, if the bronze-level company is in the discussion, Dr. Pepper Snapple. (Kenney’s communication director shared data on Coke, Pepsi, and Coca Cola FEMSA, the company’s Mexico-based bottler, in response to a fact-check inquiry for this report.) Coca Cola reported $7.4 billion in net income, Pepsi reported $5.5 billion and Dr. Pepper Snapple $764 million. Dr. Pepper Snapple and Coke experienced slight profit boosts over the year before, while Pepsi’s numbers took a $1.1-billion dip. News reports on annual and quarterly reports deemed profits for all three companies better than expected.   Our Ruling Kenney stated that big soda makes a lot of cash. Profit-wise, despite current consumers trends that may signal a bleak future for soft drink sales, carbonated beverages remain profitable, thanks, in notable cases, to reorganization and new pricing.

Did JoAnne Kloppenburg say her job as a judge is to 'promote a more equal society'?
","In the Wisconsin Supreme Court race, challenger JoAnne Kloppenburg has cast Justice Rebecca Bradley as a conservative who is too cozy with the Republican Party and GOP Gov. Scott Walker, who appointed Bradley to three judgeships in three years. But Kloppenburg, a state Court of Appeals judge in Madison, has made contributions over the years to Democratic candidates and is benefitting from the work of liberal groups such as One Wisconsin Now. Bradley, in turn, has sought to cast Kloppenburg as a judge who would rule on cases based on her personal biases. In a March 21, 2016 interview on Wisconsin Public Radio’s ""Joy Cardin Show,"" Bradley said: ""Given her judicial philosophy, JoAnne Kloppenburg has told us she thinks it's her job to promote a more equal society. She will most definitely introduce her social and political beliefs into her decision making."" We don’t know, of course, just what Kloppenburg would do as a Supreme Court justice. But what has Kloppenburg said about what her job is as a judge, and about promoting a more equal society? On her campaign website, Kloppenburg states this as being her judicial philosophy: ""I apply the law fairly, and thoughtfully, and in a principled and disciplined manner to answer the legal questions presented by the parties in a case. I approach each case with an open mind, and my decisions are based on the law and the facts, not on ideology or partisan politics. I am faithful to the court’s role as an independent check and balance on the other political branches of government. My duty is to uphold the Constitution, a sacred document that represents the will of the people and which contains the fundamental principles that define our democracy, protect individual rights and promote a more equal society."" She made a similar statement in a candidate questionnaire. As Bradley’s campaign noted to us, Kloppenburg has also said -- more than once -- that among U.S. Supreme Court justices, she aligns most with Sonia Sotomayor and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, in part because they believe in ""protecting individual rights and promoting a more equal society."" So, Kloppenburg’s statement is more broad than Bradley suggests, in that she states her job as a judge is to uphold the U.S. Constitution. But Kloppenburg also states that in her judicial philosophy, the key principles of the Constitution are protecting individual rights and promoting a more equal society. That echoes the claim made by Bradley. Our rating Bradley says ""JoAnne Kloppenburg has told us she thinks it's her job to promote a more equal society."" Kloppenburg does say that, but she also says more. Kloppenburg declares that her judicial philosophy is to uphold the U.S. Constitution, and that in her view, the fundamental principles of the Constitution are to ""protect individual rights and promote a more equal society."" Bradley’s statement is accurate but needs additional information -- our definition of Mostly True.

Hillary Clinton: US negotiated agreement that made it easier to get EU flight data
","The United States needs to work more closely with Europe to stymie international terrorism, especially stopping westerners from flocking to the Islamic State, said Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. The recent terrorist attack in Belgium, not six months after the Paris attacks, has raised concerns about European security and intelligence sharing. At a March 23 speech in California, Clinton highlighted some perceived security deficiencies among European Union nations. ""It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from E.U. nations than it is for E.U. nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state,"" she said. This claim intrigued us, so we reached out to some experts to see if Clinton was on target. Clinton is talking about the United States–European Union Agreement on Passenger Name Records, a bilateral measure intended to increase the government’s ability to track who is coming into the country. The agreement was signed in 2011 and went into effect in 2012, when Clinton was in office. As a result of this agreement, the European Union provides the United States Department of Homeland Security with passenger name records for every flight from a European Union country to the United States, and vice versa. Passenger name records are essentially very detailed flight manifests, containing information like how far in advance travelers bought their tickets, whether they made specific seat requests and even how many bags they checked. (The European Union has similar agreements with Canada and Australia.) Every expert we queried pointed out that much of the negotiation legwork on this agreement took place before Clinton joined the State Department in 2009. Though the agreement currently in effect was finalized while Clinton headed the State Department, this was the final in a series of negotiations and precursor agreements spanning about a decade following the Sept. 11, 2001, World Trade Center attacks. The standing 2012 version responded to Europeans’ information privacy concerns, and this final push happened during Clinton’s tenure. ""The agreement that Clinton was involved in is the culmination of successive agreements, beginning with the impact of 9/11,"" said Mai’a Cross, an expert in European foreign and security policy at Northeastern University. So, while Clinton's role is up for some debate, the United States does get flight manifests from the E.U. But Clinton also said that all E.U. nations don't share that information with each other. That's accurate, at least for right now.  U.S. law requires passenger name record data for any flight entering or leaving the country, but the European Union currently does not. And flight information collection policies are not universal among all 28 European Union members. For example, the United Kingdom has had its own passenger name record system in place for incoming flights, noted Kaija Schilde, an expert on Europe and transatlantic security at Boston University. She added that this issue is further complicated by the Schengen Area, a group of 26 European countries that allow passport-free travel between member countries. So if the United States wants passenger information about a flight from Germany to the New York City, that is an easier get than if Germany wants the same passenger information about a flight from Italy, said Eva-Maria Maggi, a European Union expert at the University of Arizona. This is a result of the U.S.-E.U. agreement but also the fact that the European Union doesn’t have a passenger name record policy similar to the United States, Maggi said. To be clear, the United States does not collect this information for flights that do not enter or leave the United States, like an Italy to Germany flight. Proponents of a European Union-wide system say one of the benefits of such a system is that it would harmonize these differences among member nations. In fact, one such system is on the table, and experts told us the European Parliament will likely approve it in the next couple months. In direct response to the November 2015 terrorist attacks in Paris, the Council of the European Union approved text for a policy that would require passenger name record data for all international flights entering or leaving the European Union. The law would also allow, but not require, member states to collect passenger name records for flights between member countries. Cross noted that passenger name records are just a narrow slice of intelligence information. ""If you’re talking intelligence sharing more generally, there has been more sharing within Europe than with other countries,"" she said. Our ruling Clinton said, ""It’s actually easier for the United States to get flight manifests from E.U. nations than it is for E.U. nations to get them from their own neighbors, thanks to an agreement the U.S. negotiated when I was secretary of state."" Clinton’s claim is, for the most part, on target. The European Union has an agreement with the United States to provide passenger name records for all U.S.-E.U. air travel. While this was mostly negotiated before Clinton took office, the final push happened in 2011, when she was serving as secretary of state. Countries within the European Union do not have a uniform passenger name record collection policy, so they might not be able to share the same information amongst each other as easily. However, the European Union is on the verge of enacting a policy that would require passenger name record collection for all flights entering and leaving the union. We rate Clinton’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971CCB40>],/factchecks/2016/mar/29/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-us-negotiated-agreement-made-it-ea/
"['Nevada', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Michael Roberson']","
Candidate claiming that Nevada cut taxes in 2015 doesn't pass muster
","Some Nevada Republicans are making a curious claim that they actually cut taxes in 2015, despite mountains of headlines proclaiming a ""record"" tax package to the tune of $1.4 billion. State Sen. Majority Leader Michael Roberson, who’s running for the state’s open 3rd Congressional District Seat, has claimed in candidate forums and on campaign flyers that lawmakers ""permanently cut taxes for over 95 percent of Nevada’s businesses."" ""I doubt anyone in this room is paying higher taxes based on last session,"" he told the audience at a candidate forum in early March. ""We cut taxes on 95 percent of all businesses in this state."" Digging into this claim, however, tells a different story — one that requires a little historical backtracking. Roberson’s claim centers entirely on changes made to the state’s payroll tax. Lawmakers initially approved the tax as part of the chaotic 2003 legislative session. Needing money for new K-12 education programs, the Legislature came to a compromise of $836 million in revenues, primarily from a payroll tax applied to businesses at a 0.7 percent rate (financial institutions and banks paid a 2 percent rate). That rate was lowered to 0.63 percent by 2007, but at that point the national foreclosure crisis began to decimate Nevada’s tourism and sales tax-driven economy and eventually left a massive budget hole. Facing massive budget cuts and a governor rabidly opposed to any new taxes in 2009, legislators passed a last-minute $780 million tax to stave off proposed massive cuts to education, health care and other ""essential services."" Republican lawmakers were able to negotiate a two-year expiration date into the deal, which included raises in the state sales tax, vehicle registration fees, payroll tax and business license fees. These so-called ""sunset taxes"" also created two tiers of rates in the previously universal payroll tax, designed to give smaller businesses with fewer employees a break from the increased rate. The tax was changed in 2011 to totally exempt businesses with less than $62,500 in quarterly payroll from paying into the tax, with another two-year expansion of the ""sunset"" taxes approved by lawmakers. By the next session in 2013, some lawmakers began publicly angling to make the ""temporary"" tax increases permanent, as it made up a significant chunk of the budget. Legislators ended the session by approving yet another two-year extension of the ""sunsets,"" including raising the exemption level to quarterly payrolls of $85,000. In 2015, the tax conversation shifted. Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval, who begrudgingly kept the ""sunset"" tax package in 2011, proposed a bevy of tax increases to pump millions of dollars in the state’s lagging K-12 education system. After fighting over several potential revenue plans, legislators settled on an oft-quoted figure of $1.4 billion in new and extended taxes. The ""extended"" portion comes in part from the payroll tax, which lawmakers ended up broadening by lowering the exemption cutoff to $50,000 in quarterly payroll and a 1.475 percent tax on any payroll above that. Still with us? All this means lawmakers actually expanded the payroll tax in 2015, capturing around 5,100 more businesses than in previous years by lowering exemption levels and raising the tax rate by 0.305 percent. So how does that equal a tax cut? Roberson’s campaign argues that making the ""sunset taxes"" permanent effectively locks in exemptions for businesses with smaller payrolls, thereby avoiding chances of returning to the previous universal rate for all businesses. ""Unlike previous legislatures, the 2015 GOP majority made those Nevada small businesses exempt from the payroll tax permanently instead of just a temporary fix as in years prior,"" Roberson campaign spokesman Jeremy Hughes said in an email. That’s not the usual definition of a tax cut, as no businesses are paying less in taxes. Rather, the remaining businesses under the threshold avoided the possibility of paying the tax if the ""sunset"" package expired, and will (likely) avoid future uncertainty over legislative quibbling on extending taxes every two years. Whether or not eliminating the possibility of raising taxes counts as a tax cut is an open question, Nevada Taxpayers Association president Anna Thornley said. ""The elimination of the uncertainty is definitely a plus but whether or not it can be considered a tax cut is in the eye of the beholder,"" she said in an email. But Roberson’s claim has more issues. Nevada had approximately 53,000 businesses with taxable wages in the 2014 fiscal year, but only around 18,600 had a large enough payroll to actually land above the new threshold created in 2015. Roberson’s campaign uses the total number of businesses in the state (333,000) to get to the 95 percent figure, but that’s misleading because a large percentage aren’t traditional businesses — they fall into a laundry list of pass-through corporations, small businesses and other non-payroll dependent entities, like an LLC set up for real estate. Even if lawmakers decided to sit on their hands and allow the temporary taxes to expire, the tax burden would only expand to affect those 53,000 businesses — but no change would come to the majority of registered businesses. Using the campaign’s methods, only around 11 percent of businesses registered in the state dodged the bullet of a potential tax increase. The percentage rises to roughly 66 percent exempted if you only include the applicable 53,000 businesses, but that’s still a far cry from 95 percent. Use of the word ""permanent"" is also questionable, as legislators could revisit payroll tax rates sometime in the future. Unlike statutes governing taxation in the state constitution, lawmakers only need a two-thirds majority vote to change the rate. Narrowing the focus to just the payroll tax ignores multiple other tax changes that happened in 2015. Business license fees increased from a flat $200 to a multi-tiered structure, with corporations paying $500 and others still paying $200 (the fee was scheduled to decrease to $100 before lawmakers increased it). Lawmakers also approved a new ""Commerce Tax,"" based on total business income without discounting costs or expenses. The tax is more limited than other proposals, exempting the first $4 million in business revenue per year and sources of income already subject to a gross-receipts tax, like mining and gambling. Although Sandoval signed the tax into law last June, the battle is still raging on with a group of anti-tax Republicans led by Controller Ron Knecht fighting to put a partial repeal of the ""Commerce Tax"" on the 2016 ballot. Our ruling Republican congressional candidate Michael Roberson said lawmakers ""permanently cut taxes for over 95 percent of Nevada’s businesses."" The changes made to Nevada’s payroll tax aren’t a traditional tax cut. No businesses saw their net tax bill decrease, but many businesses no longer have to worry every two years that their tax bill might suddenly rise. Still, the 95 percent figure isn’t accurate, even if we accept such a generous definition of a tax cut. And narrowly focusing on one tax change ignores many other tax increases passed by lawmakers. We rate this claim as False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809708D700>],/factchecks/2016/mar/29/michael-roberson/candidate-claiming-nevada-cut-taxes-2015-doesnt-pa/

PGA Tour commissioner says Austin 'fastest-growing city in the country' last five years
","The PGA Tour's chief, otherwise just another Austin visitor impressed by the capital’s vim and vig, ventured a claim about local growth that made us wonder. On March 27, 2016, the tour's commissioner, Tim Finchem, told reporters including the Austin American-Statesman’s Kirk Bohls that the 2016 World Golf Championship-Dell Match Play Championship wrapping up that day at the Austin Country Club had been a ""home run."" ""Austin is such a cool town,"" Finchem said, expressing hope the event would occur there again. And, he said, ""Austin’s the fastest-growing city in the country the last five years."" Good grief. Really? We’ve gauged before how much Austin grows--even by the day. But has it outpaced the growth of every U.S. city over the past five years? News story Finchem's likely source We failed to hear back from Finchem or the PGA Tour. But we suspect an American-Statesman news story published three days before he spoke fueled his claim. That story said: ""From July 2014 to July 2015, the Austin-Round Rock metropolitan area — which includes Travis, Williamson, Hays, Bastrop and Caldwell counties — grew from 1,943,465 to 2,000,860, making it the fastest-growing metropolitan area with a population over 1 million for the fifth year in a row."" Ryan Robinson, Austin’s city demographer, commented: ""That of course won’t be news to anyone who lives here. We’ve become so accustomed to that very high level of population growth being part of our daily existence."" Robinson further said Austin has the most diversified economy in the state. The fastest-growth distinction described in the news story drew on just-updated U.S. Census Bureau data indicating that from July 2014 through June 2015, the Austin area’s 2.95 percent population growth outpaced the 2.6 percent growth in the Orlando, Florida, area, which landed No. 2 nationally among the largest metropolitan areas, as this compilation shows (check out the Statesman’s population interactive here):                            Houston area led nation in raw growth But by raw population gains, the Houston-The Woodlands-Sugar Land metro area gained the most residents nationally in 2014-15 and also over five years during which the region drew nearly 750,000 additional residents, according to bureau figures. Dallas-Fort Worth landed second over those years, notching 676,582 added residents. In contrast, the Austin area’s five-year gain of 284,571 residents placed it 11th nationally in raw growth, according to the bureau. A March 2016 Houston Chronicle news story noted: ""As a whole, the so-called Texas Triangle of Houston, Austin/San Antonio, and Dallas-Fort Worth added more people last year than any other state in the country, growing by more than 400,000 residents, or roughly the population of Minneapolis."" Authorities confirm Austin region’s leading-edge growth But rates of population growth are arguably the best way to fairly compare changes in different regions and cities. So we asked federal and Austin experts if the capital indeed led the nation in its rate of population growth. Basically yes, we heard, with caveats. By email, a Census Bureau spokesman, Robert Bernstein, provided a chart indicating that among cities of 50,000 residents or more, Austin by itself -- not considering nearby cities and counties -- ranked 23rd for its 12.5 percent growth from April 2010 through June 2014. The fastest-growing municipality was South Jordan City, Utah, which is part of the Salt Lake City metropolitan area. According to the bureau, Texas cities that grew faster than Austin in that period include a Dallas suburb, Frisco (23.9 percent); Cedar Park, northwest of Austin; McKinney; Conroe; Midland; Pearland; New Braunfels; Odessa; League City and Round Rock (which placed No. 22 nationally with 12.8 percent growth). But Austin by itself sticks out on the chart as the most populous city also ranking among the nation’s highest rate of growth. That is, Austin’s estimated July 2014 population of 912,791 outpaced the population of the next-most-populous city with faster growth -- Irvine, California, home to 248,531 residents -- by 267 percent. Bernstein told us that if you limit your focus to cities of 250,000 residents or more, Austin ranked No. 1 in its percentage growth over the 2010-2014 period. He said city population changes from July 2014 through June 2015 would be released in May 2016. Separately by email, Beverly Kerr of the Austin Chamber of Commerce said that if you consider all metropolitan areas, the Austin region didn’t rank No. 1 in percentage growth from April 2010 through June 2015. Among ""all metros,"" Kerr said, the Midland area and The Villages region in Florida outgrew the greater Austin area, per this chart she downloaded. Bernstein, following up, told us the greater Austin area ranked No. 1 in growth rate among metro areas with 200,000 residents or more. Our ruling Finchem said: ""Austin’s the fastest-growing city in the country the last five years."" Census data support his claim, though a few clarifications are in order. Over five years, the greater Austin area, sweeping in several counties, had the fastest growth rate of any metro area that was also home to 200,000 residents or more. And from April 2010 through June 2014, Austin by itself ranked first by growth rate among cities with 250,000 residents or more; less populous cities grew faster.

"['Supreme Court', 'Virginia', 'Mark Herring']","
Herring correct about Supreme Court confirmations during election years
","Virginia Attorney General Mark R. Herring dismisses the notion that the U.S. Senate shouldn’t fill the Supreme Court vacancy before voters head to the polls in November. ""Since 1900, six (U.S. Supreme Court) justices have been confirmed during election years, including Justice Anthony Kennedy, who was confirmed in the final year of the Reagan Administration,"" Herring and fellow Democratic attorneys general wrote in a March 10 letter to U.S. Senate leaders. Herring’s letter was sent less than a week before President Barack Obama nominated U.S. Appeals Court Judge Merrick Garland to succeed Justice Antonin Scalia, who died Feb. 13. We recently looked at another Herring claim that every nominee since 1875 had received a confirmation hearing, a statement we rated Mostly False. Here, we’re checking to see whether the attorney general was closer to the mark when he said there have been six justices confirmed during presidential election years since the start of the 20th century. Michael Kelly, his spokesman, pointed us to several sources to back Herring’s statement, including a nearly identical claim on the White House website. He also pointed us to several other sources, including an article in The New York Times about presidential election year confirmations and the U.S. Senate’s historic listing of all Supreme Court vacancies. We have some familiarity with the history of presidential election year confirmations going back to 1940, because we checked a statement by Rep. Bob Goodlatte, R-6th, who claimed that was the last time the Senate confirmed a Supreme Court nominee during a presidential election year. We rated that claim Half True. Our colleagues at PolitiFact have looked at statements examining presidential year confirmations going back even further, to the early 1900s, which hews more closely to Herring’s claim. We examined the record to see if Herring was correct. The first Supreme Court confirmation in a presidential election year in the 20th century occurred in 1912. President William Howard Taft nominated Mahlon Pitney in February that year, and the Senate confirmed him the following month. In 1916, President Woodrow Wilson nominated Louis Brandeis and John Clarke to the high court, and both were confirmed that year. In 1932, President Herbert Hoover nominated Benjamin Cardozo to high court, and the Senate confirmed him within two weeks. In 1940, President Franklin D. Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the court; the overwhelmingly Democratic-led Senate approved the choice less than two weeks later. After Murphy’s elevation to the court, it would be nearly five decades before there was another justice confirmed in an election year. Anthony Kennedy, the justice Herring specifically cited in his letter, was confirmed in a 97-0 vote in the Democratically controlled Senate on Feb. 3, 1988. That was the final full year of President Ronald Reagan’s administration. Republicans argue that Kennedy’s case isn’t comparable to the current Supreme Court vacancy, because Kennedy filled a seat that opened six months before the 1988 election year. Reagan initially nominated Robert Bork to fill the vacancy left by retiring Justice Lewis F. Powell Jr., but the Senate rejected him in a vote that October. Reagan then announced he would nominate Douglas Ginsburg. But Ginsburg’s nomination was withdrawn after he acknowledged smoking marijuana as a college student and early in his teaching career. Finally, Reagan nominated Kennedy in November 1987. Regardless of that debate, Kennedy’s elevation to the court indeed did occur during an election year. We should note there have been some false starts in getting high court nominees through the Senate during a presidential election year. President Lyndon B. Johnson tried to elevate Justice Abe Fortas to chief justice and nominated Homer Thornberry to take Fortas’ place on the bench in 1968. But both nominations fizzled after the Senate filibustered the Fortas nomination. Our ruling Herring said there have been six presidential election year confirmations for Supreme Court seats going back to 1900. There indeed were six justices confirmed during presidential election years in that time frame.

Image in a Chris Abele ad shows lake that's supposedly created by Estabrook Dam
","A new television ad from Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele shows a large body of water with a sizable boat tied up in front of a two-story boathouse. That image forms the backdrop for a statement printed on the screen about his opponent’s support of repairs to the Estabrook Dam on the Milwaukee River: ""Chris Larson: $5 million of taxpayer money to benefit a few wealthy citizens."" The narrator takes the claim further, saying the repairs give the wealthy residents ""their own lake."" The message conveyed by the image is clear: These are the properties of those wealthy residents living along the lake created by the Estabrook Dam. Only they’re not. A deeper dive Before we, um, dive into this one, here is some background on the long-running debate over whether to repair the dam. Built in the 1930s, the dam -- which sits on the river just north of Milwaukee, at the border of Shorewood and Glendale -- was installed to help control flooding and to maintain swimming and water recreation in an urban setting, especially in and around Lincoln Park. It has also created generations of what amounts to lakefront living for some people. When the dam gates are closed, the river forms a 100-acre impoundment upstream. There are about 165 property owners in the area whose property abuts the water, according to a 2015 report prepared for the county. Today, the dam is in poor condition,. The state Department of Natural Resources has ordered the county to keep the gates open until the structure is either repaired or abandoned. That means the lake has been, in effect, drained, and it’s a plain-old river again. Abele and the County Board have disagreed about how to proceed. Larson himself was a member of the board before he was elected state Senator. Abele sides with the Milwaukee Riverkeepers, a coalition of environmental groups that wants the dam removed so the river can be kept in its natural state. Years ago, the North Avenue Dam, several miles downstream, was removed and experts have said the faster current has led to improved water quality, a thriving fish population and new wildlife habitat. A majority of the County Board disagrees and wants to spend about $3.4 million on repairs and $2.2 million in operating and maintenance costs over the next 20 years. As a county supervisor, Larson voted in 2009 to repair the dam. That’s the genesis of the $5 million figure Abele used in the ad. However, in a recent  interview, Larson said he’s willing to consider removing the dam. Image is all wet That leads us to the image used in the ad. It looks more like Door County than the Milwaukee River. And that’s not the kind of boat or property you’d find in that area. The boat pictured is either a fishing boat or cruiser and could be up to 36-feet long, said Charles Plueddeman, an Oshkosh-based freelance writer who focuses on the marine industry. ""A boat this size could be used on large lakes or offshore in salt water,"" he said. ""When I looked at the photo my first thought was ‘this does not look like Wisconsin,’"" Plueddeman said. ""I've not been to that site, but I don't think it would be surrounded by the high, rocky bluffs in this photo. And that would be a very big boat to use on that little impoundment."" Indeed, pontoons and jet skis are more commonly found in the area, said Clark Blachly, who owns a nearby home. ""I have been up and down this river hundreds of times there is nothing remotely like this,"" he said. We asked Abele’s campaign manager Tia Torhorst about the image in the ad. She said it was ""stock footage"" and was unaware of where it was shot. In short, it’s not the Milwaukee River. We’ve seen previous -- admittedly higher profile -- instances of the wrong images being used to make point in a political ad. Earlier this year, Republican Donald Trump aired a TV ad purporting to show Mexicans swarming over ""our southern border."" But the footage was of African migrants streaming over a fence between Morocco and the Spanish enclave of Melilla. That claim was rated Pants on Fire.

Gov. Pat McCrory: No Title IX threat to billions in federal funding after controversial new LGBT law
","One of the biggest questions in the ongoing debate over North Carolina’s new statewide law invalidating local LGBT protections is the status of $4.5 billion in federal education funding via Title IX. Title IX is a 1972 law that requires educational institutions to treat men and women equally. It has been used to punish schools for not taking sexual assault seriously, or for not offering women chances to play sports. The federal government has begun arguing in recent years that Title IX protections extend to transgender students, and a 2014 Department of Education memo formalized that position.   ""All students, including transgender students and students who do not conform to sex stereotypes, are protected from sex-based discrimination under Title IX,"" the memo reads. ""Under Title IX, a recipient generally must treat transgender students consistent with their gender identity in all aspects of the planning, implementation, enrollment, operation, and evaluation of single-sex classes."" Transgender people are those who don’t identify with the gender on their birth certificate. Even if they have one gender’s anatomy, they live life as the other gender and consider themselves to truly be that gender. One widely cited study in 2011 estimated that 0.3 percent of adults are transgender. North Carolina’s new law specifically prohibits schools from allowing transgender students to use bathrooms consistent with their gender identity.  The law says schools may only permit a student to use the restrooms, locker rooms or other such facilities of the gender listed on the student’s birth certificate. The ACLU and some Democratic legislators say that contradiction between the state law and the federal guidance could cost billions. North Carolina is scheduled to receive an estimated $4.58 billion from the federal government in 2016 for education funding, which could be at risk with a Title IX violation. Those funds are largely for Pell Grants and student loans but also go toward K-12 programs for homeless students, rural schools, adult literacy and more. Republicans thoroughly disagree that the funding is at risk, and it was one of 18 points Gov. Pat McCrory made in a press release over Easter weekend which he dubbed ""Facts vs. Myths."" ""Will this bill threaten federal funding for public schools under Title IX?"" McCrory asked, only to then answer: ""No, according to a federal court which has looked at a similar issue."" McCrory has a point,  but he leaves out a lot of detail. In eastern Virginia, a federal judge did rule that a school district wasn’t violating Title IX by refusing to let a transgender teen, who was born a female but identifies as male, use the boys bathroom. In that lawsuit, the student was represented by the ACLU and had statements of support from the U.S. Department of Justice and Department of Education. The Virginia case McCrory knows the case well; he was one of two governors (along with Maine Republican Gov. Paul LePage) who submitted briefs on behalf of the school district in that case. A few other states weighed in with briefs from their attorneys general, but North Carolina Attorney General Roy Cooper – and McCrory’s Democratic opponent in November – declined to follow suit. The Virginia school district restricted students to bathrooms based on their ""biological gender,"" which is similar to the ""biological sex"" wording used in North Carolina now. And in Virginia, the judge said that restriction is OK. So McCrory is right on that much. But he fails to mention that the case is currently under consideration by the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals, the federal appeals court which also covers North Carolina. The ACLU has further asked that the 85-year-old judge in question be removed from the case, alleging he didn’t follow proper procedure and made statements indicating he doesn’t have a firm grasp of science. ""Regardless of the outcome of this case, the public in general, and transgender people in particular, should have confidence the proceedings are not based on mistaken assumptions that continue to stigmatize transgender people, even if unintentionally,"" the ACLU wrote in asking the appeals court to remove the judge, Robert G. Doumar. The appeal states the judge refused expert witness testimony, allowed hearsay evidence on behalf of the school district but not on behalf of the student, refused testimony from the student, referred to the student as having a ""mental disorder"" – even after being informed that ""The American Psychiatric Association has made clear that Gender Dysphoria should not be described as a ‘disorder’"" – and went off on a tangent about federal policies concerning drug use, immigration and other unrelated issues. The appeals court heard the appeal in January but has not yet announced its decision. Other cases Last year a judge in Pennsylvania ruled against a transgender University of Pittsburgh student, who was expelled and criminally charged after repeatedly ignoring a bathroom ban. In that case, unlike in the Virginia case happening around the same time, the federal government did not weigh in. And then there’s the matter of other cases in which schools have settled with the federal government rather than going to court, like in the Virginia case. Schools in Illinois and California changed their policies after being threatened with the loss of funding by the federal government via Title IX. In Illinois, a transgender student who was born a male was allowed to change in the girls locker room, but behind a curtain. Previously the student had been using private, single-occupancy rooms to change – a provision that North Carolina’s law does allow for – but the federal authorities told Illinois officials that wasn’t good enough. In California, a school district agreed to let transgender students use the facilities of the gender they identify as, to amend its anti-discrimination policies to include ""gender identity,"" to train administrators on how to accommodate transgender students and to give students ""age-appropriate"" lessons to discourage bullying and sexual harassment of transgender people. Our ruling Gov. Pat McCrory is correct that a federal judge said schools shouldn’t lose Title IX funding for not allowing transgender students to use the bathroom of the gender they identify with. But McCrory failed to mention that the case is still pending on appeal, and that there are questions about the judge’s impartiality. Furthermore, the threat of losing Title IX funds was real enough to convince authorities in Illinois and California to comply. In the end, it largely comes down to politics. The two judges who have ruled against transgender students are Republican political appointees. The federal departments of education and justice, which typically support transgender students, are run by Democratic political appointees. McCrory is right that a judge said there shouldn’t be a threat to Title IX funding in these types of situations. But that’s not to say there’s no threat at all – the official stance of the Obama administration, after all, has been enough of a threat to scare Illinois and California into making changes.

Grover Norquist says State Department employees sent thank-yous to donors of Clinton Foundation
","Opinion polls consistently show that if there’s one thing Hillary Clinton is up against with voters, it’s that too many of them question her honesty. Anti-tax advocate Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform, fed into that theme during an interview on Fox Business with host Maria Bartiromo on March 24, 2016. Norquist segued from talking about her presidential campaign fundraising to the ""mixing of her official job as secretary of state and the Clinton Foundation."" Norquist said, ""We now know (that) officials were sending official thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation. Letting them know ‘wink, wink, nudge, nudge’ that you didn’t just give to the Clinton Foundation. Hillary Clinton, secretary of state, appreciates what you’ve done."" We wondered if Norquist's allegation was correct. When President-elect Barack Obama considered making Hillary Clinton his secretary of state, the immediate concern was that foreign interests might curry favor at the State Department by supporting her husband’s efforts at the Clinton Foundation and the Clinton Global Initiative, also called CGI. To clear the way for Clinton’s nomination, those organizations agreed to a number of measures to avoid real and apparent conflicts. Among the changes, the foundation would publish the names of its donors and separate itself from the Clinton Global Initiative. Bill Clinton would not raise funds for CGI, and CGI itself would no longer accept donations from foreign governments or hold events outside the United States. After all that, did Clinton's State Department really cross the line by sending officials thanks to the foundation's donors? We asked Norquist’s spokesman John Kartch for the source behind the statement that State Department officials were sending thank-yous to people who gave to the Clinton Foundation. Kartch sent us a link to a page on the website of Judicial Watch, which describes itself as a conservative educational group. Judicial Watch posted a number of documents it received through a Freedom of Information Act request to the State Department. The first few pages in the collection were an exchange of emails between Clinton’s chief of staff Cheryl Mills and other top aides at the State Department, and Amitabh Desai, director of foreign policy at the Clinton Foundation. (Before joining the foundation, Desai was a legislative aide to then-Sen. Hillary Clinton.) Desai wanted Secretary Clinton to speak at the closing session of the Clinton Global Initiative meeting on Sept. 25, 2009. The conversation begins on Aug. 22, 2009, with this letter from Desai to Mills and Huma Abedin, Clinton’s deputy chief of staff, at the State Department:  To decode the lingo of CGI, ""HRC"" is Hillary Rodham Clinton, ""WJC"" is William Jefferson Clinton and ""commitments"" are agreements among aid groups, governments and often corporations to work on a particular project. Desai’s list of three commitments included: Launching a media campaign to reduce sexual violence against girls. It involved the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, several United Nations agencies, a large Brazilian ad agency and a foundation set up by a former hedge fund owner. Promoting the use of vitamin and mineral fortified food among poorer Indian households. It involved a major Indian food corporation. Expanding a micro-insurance fund. It involved an investment fund that had raised $44 million to provide small insurance policies in poor communities. Mills at the State Department answered, ""I think this if fine but here's my question - how does this work - are these announced before or after she speaks and what relationship are they supposed to bear to what she says?"" Desai said commitments are announced throughout the conference. ""We could give you a list of all announcements as they get scheduled as we get closer to the meeting, and anything else that would be helpful."" Mills replied, ""It would be helpful to have list of commitments during whole session so she can reference more than those just around her speech."" The final words in this email chain come from Caitlin Klevorick, a former consultant to the foundation who became a special assistant in the Secretary of State’s office. ""One question is if we want to see if there is a decent mass of fs (food security) related commitments to announce together at closing as a ‘mega’ commitment,"" Klevorick wrote. That is the sum total of the interactions between State Department and Clinton Foundation staff, according to the emails obtained by Judicial Watch. We asked Kartch at Americans for Tax Reform if we had missed anything and did not hear back. Tom Fitton, president of Judicial Watch, said he sees clear collaboration between the two entities. ""State Department and Clinton Foundation staff worked together on how Mrs. Clinton could thank Foundation supporters for their commitments during a speech, which Mrs. Clinton did,"" Fitton said. ""Mrs. Clinton, as the result of work by her aides and a Clinton Foundation representative, provided an official thank you during her speech."" This is different from Norquist’s claim. Norquist said State Department officials were sending official thank-yous. The emails don’t describe that. Further, in her actual speech, Clinton didn’t thank anyone for contributing money. Early on, she did express her appreciation, but that was aimed at governments, not donors. ""As secretary of state, I really, in terms of protocol, should be acknowledging all of the heads of state and heads of government who are here, but there are far too many,"" Clinton said. ""So let me just express my deep appreciation for your involvement and for your presence here.  We look forward to working with you and your governments as we move forward on the new agenda of the Obama administration."" A moment later, she praises the entire audience. ""This is an exceptional gathering of people, who have made exceptional commitments to bettering our world. We see it in everything you do. It seems a good opportunity, given the talent, the energy and the passion in this room, to talk about an exceptional global challenge, chronic hunger and what we all can do about it."" Clinton spent the bulk of her speech talking about the White House policy to combat hunger. At the end, she told the audience, ""We need your ideas and your feedback, and we need your active support in any and every capacity."" Kathleen Clark, who specializes in public sector ethics law at Washington University in St. Louis, told told us she didn’t see any smoking gun in the emails Norquist offered as evidence. Our ruling Norquist said that State Department officials were sending official thank-yous to donors to the Clinton Foundation. We looked at the source documents he relied on and found nothing that supported his version of events. State Department staff did ask for lists of projects and partners in preparation for a speech Clinton was to give at a Clinton Global Initiative meeting. However, there is no hint that any staff member expressed official appreciation to any donor. There is no indication that money for those projects flowed through CGI. Finally, Clinton thanked governments for showing up, but didn’t thank donors. She praised the audience in general, but that would include many who were on the receiving end of CGI’s efforts. The documents do not say what Norquist suggested they said. We rate this claim False. Correction: An earlier version of this story said the Clinton Global Initiative and the Clinton Foundation separated in 2009. Actually, the groups separated in 2010.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E21040>],/factchecks/2016/mar/28/grover-norquist/grover-norquist-says-state-department-employees-se/

Clinton promoted children's health care
","In a sharp exchange with John Edwards during a Jan. 5, 2008, debate in New Hampshire, Hillary Clinton made the case that she has a well-established record of fighting for change. She pointed to her role in starting the State Children's Health Insurance Program, called SCHIP. The program, created in 1997, promotes health coverage for children by providing federal funding to states. The states then put up their own money and set rules to provide care for uninsured children. ""There are 7,000 kids in New Hampshire who have health care because I helped to create the Children's Health Insurance Program,"" Clinton said. Clinton's number is correct. A study by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that in June 2006, there were 7,688 children enrolled in SCHIP in New Hampshire. Clinton is also on solid ground saying that she helped to create SCHIP. Much of the credit for SCHIP usually goes to Sen. Ted Kennedy, D-Mass., who shepherded the legislation through a Republican-controlled Congress. But the Clinton campaign has said previously that she used her influence behind the scenes to push for SCHIP, and there is evidence to support that. Soon after the legislation passed, the  New York Times  reported, ""Participants in the campaign for the health bill both on and off Capitol Hill said the first lady had played a crucial behind-the-scenes role in lining up White House support."" In a previous campaign ad, Clinton claimed credit for SCHIP without any qualifiers, and we found that contention Half True, given the other people who had a hand in passing the legislation. (See that ruling  here  .) But in this case, she accurately said she helped to create SCHIP (as in she wasn't the only one), and she got the number right on how many children are enrolled in New Hampshire. For these reasons, we rate Clinton's statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C88940>],/factchecks/2008/jan/06/hillary-clinton/clinton-promoted-childrens-health-care/
"['National', 'Energy', 'Bill Richardson']","
He did as he was asked
","With oil prices setting record highs and hovering around $100 a barrel, most candidates talked during a Jan. 5, 2008, debate about what they would do to bring prices down. New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson talked about what he had already done.
 
Richardson served as secretary of the Energy Department under former President Bill Clinton, from late 1998 until the end of 2000.
 
""I went to OPEC countries and tried to get them to increase production so prices would go down,"" Richardson boasted. ""At the time, there was a home heating oil crisis here in New England. I created reserves of home heating oil.""
 
Richardson did indeed visit several OPEC countries in the spring of 2000, including Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, encouraging them to increase supply, which would help keep prices lower, according to the Energy Department Web site.
 
Those visits followed a memorably expensive winter for New Englanders, who suffered spiking prices for home heating oil, giving rise to what many called the Northeastern home heating oil crisis. Winter prices for home heating oil in New Hampshire more than doubled from February 1999 to February 2000, when New Hampshire prices peaked at $1.89 a gallon.
 
On July 10, 2000, President Clinton directed Richardson ""to establish a 2-million barrel home heating oil component of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the Northeast."" With Richardson in charge, the Energy Department established the 2-million-barrel reserve later that year.
 
The following winter, prices fell back slightly, hovering in the mid $1.50s.
 
The Bush administration continued the home heating oil reserves, according to the Energy Department Web site. In mid 2007, those reserves stood just shy of 2-million barrels.
 
But that hasn't stopped prices from surging, as Richardson himself pointed out. ""Look at prices now in New Hampshire, $3.20, something like that. It's the highest ever.""
 
In fact, Richardson underestimated New Hampshire prices. The weekly average topped $3.34 a gallon on Dec. 31, 2007, according to the Energy Information Administration.
 
PolitiFact looked back at peak prices from the previous crisis. In February 2000 in New Hampshire, prices hit $1.89 per gallon. Using an inflation calculator from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, we calculated that it equaled $2.31 in 2007 dollars, more than a dollar shy of the current price. We also looked back over Energy Information Administration prices for New Hampshire going back to 1990, adjusting several price spikes for inflation. None came close to today's price.
 
Richardson told the truth: He visited OPEC countries around the same time as the home heating oil crisis in New England, and he helped establish the home heating oil reserve.
 
Did that reserve lower prices? That's unclear, since the reserve remains today, even though — as Richardson himself points out — heating oil prices in New Hampshire are ""the highest ever.""
 
Still, Richardson earns a True.

"['National', 'Terrorism', 'Hillary Clinton']","
He fought to improve it, then voted for it
","Sen. Hillary Clinton, trying to retrieve momentum after losing the Iowa caucuses, went after Sen. Barack Obama in a Jan. 5, 2008, debate in New Hampshire and charged him with being a flip-flopper.
 
""You've changed positions within three years on ... a range of issues that you put forth when you ran for the Senate,"" Clinton said. ""You said you would vote against the Patriot Act, then you came to the Senate, you voted for it.""
 
Clinton questioned how serious Obama is about scrapping the 2001 antiterrorism law, noting that he voted to extend it in early 2006 after pledging as a Senate candidate to scrap or replace the law.
 
A closer examination reveals that while Clinton's charge is technically correct, Obama went further than she did in trying to expand civil rights guarantees and give Democrats more chances to change the law.
 
As a candidate for the Senate in 2003, Obama said he supported repealing or replacing the Patriot Act, branding it ""shoddy and dangerous"" in a response to a National Organization for Women survey of candidates. Obama never got a clear-cut opportunity to make good on the pledge, but was active during a debate in late 2005 and early 2006 on reauthorizing 16 expiring provisions in the law.
 
House and Senate negotiators had deadlocked for months on whether to include more protections for civil liberties and to impose time limits on some of the most contentious provisions in the sweeping law. After consultations with the White House, Republican chief negotiators presented a compromise that won enough Democratic support to reauthorize the act.
 
However, Obama and 29 fellow Democrats along with one independent voted against limiting debate in an effort to allow Russ Feingold, D-Wis., the only senator to vote against the original law in 2001, to offer amendments that would have, among other things, put in place stronger judicial reviews of administration actions. It also imposed shorter time limits on so-called ""sneak-and-peek"" searches, in which law enforcement secretly enters a suspect's premises without the suspect's knowledge or permission.
 
Clinton, in contrast, joined 14 fellow Democrats and all of the Senate's 55 Republicans in voting to shut off debate and proceed to a final vote on the compromise.
 
Once Obama's faction lost the bid to keep the debate going, he voted for the compromise. The final tally was 95-4. Clinton was also among those senators voting yes.
 
Obama said the final deal was not ideal but was an improvement over earlier Republican proposals. ""This compromise does modestly improve the Patriot Act by strengthening civil liberties protections without sacrificing the tools that law enforcement needs to keep us safe,"" he said, adding, ""I urge my colleagues to continue working on ways to improve the civil liberties protections in the Patriot Act after it is reauthorized.""
 
So while Obama did vote to reauthorize the Patriot Act, he did so after working to improve the law by expanding civil rights guarantees. We rule Clinton's statement Half True.

"['National', 'Ethics', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Lobbyists live in Obama's glass house
","Hillary Clinton highlighted an accurate inconsistency in Barack Obama's rhetoric and reality during the Democratic debate in New Hampshire on Jan. 5, 2008, three days ahead of the state's primary.
 
""You know, when it comes to lobbyists ... Sen. Obama's chair in New Hampshire is a lobbyist,"" Clinton said. ""He lobbies for the drug companies.""
 
As Clinton talked, Obama shook his head no as if he disagreed. ""He was shaking his head because her implication was that it violated our lobbyist pledge and his role quite clearly does not,"" Obama spokesman Bill Burton said afterward. The Democrat has pledged not to take money from federal lobbyists or from federal political action committees.
 
The man on the hot seat is Jim Demers, a veteran New Hampshire strategist and early Obama supporter who is one of the campaign's four state co-chairs.
 
In the May 20, 2007, announcement of his position, the Obama campaign kept its distance, labeling Demers a ""former lobbyist"" and saying he ""will act in a VOLUNTARY role as part of the statewide team.""
 
And for good reason. On the campaign trail, Obama frequently assails lobbyists' influence in Washington, rejecting their campaign contributions and vowing not to let them work in his White House. (We previously

found his antilobbyist policy has a few loopholes

that allow him to accept money from well-connected state lobbyists.)
 
Records at the New Hampshire secretary of state's office show Demers currently is a registered lobbyist. He is president of the Demers Group, a lobbying firm based in Concord, N.H. In fact, he filed forms Dec. 28, 2007, to lobby for 20 organizations — including drugmaker Pfizer and the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA).
 
Demers, a University of Miami alum, is an experienced political player in New Hampshire. He served three terms in the state House and in 2004 was named the most influential lobbyist by PoliticsNH.com, according to biographies listed on various Web sites. Records show he is not currently a registered federal lobbyist.
 
Confronted by Clinton's statement, the Obama campaign once again drew a line between lobbyists who seek to influence the federal government and those like Demers who work at the state level.
 
""A ban on lobbying money and PACs is far from perfect,"" Robert Gibbs, Obama's communications director, said in a statement. ""There is a difference between a college football player and professional football player.""
 
By noting Obama's lobbyist ties, Clinton is trying to deflect the barrage of criticism she has received for taking the most money among all presidential candidates from lobbyists and the health care industry. (Claims we previously

found Mostly True

.)
 
Despite the Obama campaign's contention that there is a difference between lobbyists at the federal level and lobbyists at the state level, Clinton's charge was unspecific. It simply says Obama's chair in New Hampshire is a lobbyist. He is. We find Clinton's claim to be True.

"['National', 'Iraq', 'Mike Huckabee']","
Romney supported it from the start
","Mike Huckabee has been trying to convince voters recently that while he's committed to the troop surge in Iraq, Mitt Romney has wavered.
 
After winning the Iowa caucuses, Huckabee carried that theme into the Republican debate on Jan. 5, 2008, telling Romney, ""I supported the surge when you didn't."" He has made the point in other forums, too, saying in a Dec. 30, 2007, appearance on

Meet the Press

: ""I stood by (President Bush) in the war. I stood by him in the surge. I wasn't a latecomer like Mitt Romney was to believing that the surge was effective.""
 
Like Huckabee, Romney immediately and publicly supported the troop surge when President Bush announced it on Jan. 10, 2007. Seven months later, Romney announced a push to give extra support to the soldiers participating in the surge.
 
Because the record does not support Huckabee's claims, we asked his staff to explain. They responded with links to recent interviews and debates that they said would show a difference between the candidates. We'll address them individually:
 
• First, the staff analysis paired two clips — a Huckabee statement that aired Jan. 10 and 11 on the Fox network in which he praises Bush's announcement and a Dec. 2, 2006, article on the conservative Web site, HumanEvents.com, in which Romney — not yet a candidate for president — declined to weigh in on the issue until the president's announcement.
 
The staff omitted Romney's Jan. 10, 2007, announcement that he supported the surge. It also did not include Huckabee's Jan. 24, 2007, statement in an MSNBC interview expressing doubts about the strategy. In the interview, Huckabee said, ""I'm not sure that I support the troop surge if that surge has to come from our guard and reserve troops which have really been overly stretched.""
 
• Next, the Huckabee staff pointed to an April 3, 2007, interview on

Good Morning America

in which Romney supported a secret timetable for withdrawal, saying: ""There's no question that the president and (Iraqi) Prime Minister al-Maliki have to have a series of timetables and milestones that they speak about, but those shouldn't be for public pronouncement. ... You don't want the enemy to understand how long they have to wait in the weeds until you're going to be gone.""
 
The staff left out Huckabee's Feb. 13, 2006, interview with

USA Today,

in which he, like Romney, saw the need for a withdrawal strategy. ""I supported the president when he went in,"" Huckabee told the newspaper. ""But I am disappointed. We don't have an exit strategy. I worry about the equipment of our armed forces. I worry that there is no end game. I don't favor a pullout date, but I believe we have to have a timetable for Iraq to take over security and civil administration. And we don't have that.""
 
• Finally, the staff points to a September 2007 Republican debate in Durham, N.H., arguing: ""Governor Huckabee said, 'We have to continue the surge' (while) Governor Romney was only willing to commit that the surge was 'apparently' working, saying his course of action depended on 'if' the surge was working.
 
We would note two things.
 
First, the two candidates were asked very different questions in that debate. Romney was asked how long into the future he would commit U.S. troops in Iraq while Huckabee was asked directly if the surge should continue. Second, Romney also expressed hope the surge would work and said the troops should be supported.
 
In addition, we note that the Councll on Foreign Relations, an independent think tank, finds no difference between Romney and Huckabee on this issue, saying both support the troop surge.
 
Huckabee's claims about Romney were the subject of a Jan. 6, 2007, interview with Chris Wallace on

Fox News Sunday.

Wallace pressed him on the fact that the record did not square with his claims. Huckabee responded but did not answer the question.
 
The record shows that Huckabee and Romney both have supported the surge and, at times, have both expressed doubts about the ability of the president's Iraq strategy to work in the long run. Huckabee says he's more committed to the surge. We find his claim False.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
Yep. Reagan did the A-word
","The GOP candidates keep sparring over who's tougher on immigration.
In this climate, dem is fightin' words to say your opponent supports ""sanctuary"" or ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants.
 
But as Giuliani reminded his foes during the Jan. 5, 2008, Republican debate, none other than Ronald Reagan, the patron saint of modern-day conservatism, signed the very law that Republicans call amnesty.
 
Say it ain't so!
 
Sorry. It's so. In 1986, Reagan signed an immigration reform bill, the first in 20 years, that legalized the status for 1.7-million people.
 
Some defenders of the law dispute the term ""amnesty.""
 
But here's how Edwin Meese, Reagan's former attorney general, characterizes what his boss did: ""President Reagan called this what it was: amnesty. Indeed, look up the term 'amnesty' in Black's Law Dictionary, and you'll find it says, 'the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act provided amnesty for undocumented aliens already in the country.' ""
 
Reagan signed the bill after Republicans and Democrats cobbled together an amnesty program in response to concerns from farmers worried about harvesting profits. The official record of congressional debates shows that lawmakers intended the program to provide a steady supply of labor for growers of perishable crops, such as cherries, grapes, peaches, etc. At the time the bill was written, however, ""perishable"" was defined so loosely that more durable crops such as potted plants, tobacco and seedlings were lumped in as well.
 
So even at the start, this program could be interpreted in ways that would benefit employers looking to save on wages.
 
To qualify for temporary status, migrants had to show they entered the United States before Jan. 1, 1982, and that they had continuously resided since then. They could get permanent residency within 18 months after that if they met certain requirements, such as learning English. The program took effect in 1987, also covering up to 350,000 people who had worked in U.S. agriculture at least 90 days in each of the preceding three years.
 
Many have called the program a success because it awarded green cards to 2.7-million migrants, giving them the hope of entry to the American middle class.
 
In exchange for the amnesty, the new law was supposed to have beefed up border patrols and stiffened fines for both the migrant workers and employers in cases of violation. Alas, the law failed to stop illegal immigration, and many critics of the law say the government never thoroughly regulated employers who skirted the law's requirements.
 
This much is certain: If the law aimed to curb illegal immigration, it failed: When the law was passed, there were about 5-million illegal immigrants; now, there's an estimated 12-million.
 
When Reagan signed the law, many predicted it would encourage the hiring of more migrants, especially outside of agriculture, and that this would spur the backlash against immigration that we're seeing today.
 
Giuliani, it would seem, brought up Reagan's legacy to show how difficult the immigration issue is. In doing so, he didn't trip any alarms on the Truth-O-Meter, which scores him a True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Mitt Romney']","
Obama plan not a takeover
","
In a question at a New Hampshire debate, the Republican candidates were asked how they would campaign against Barack Obama if he wins the Democratic nomination. Mitt Romney's first response was to argue that Obama ""wants the government to take over health care, spend hundreds of billions of dollars of new money for health insurance for everyone.""
 
Problem is, Obama's plan keeps the free-market health care system intact, particularly employer-based insurance. His plan expands existing programs for the uninsured by increaseing eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children's Health Insurance Program. His plan also creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. And it outlines several strategies aimed at reining in costs for everyone, such as streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventative care.
 
Romney is also off when he says that Obama wants to spend hundreds of billions of dollars. The Obama campaign has said that Obama believes the cost will be less than $100-billion — between $50-billion and $65-billion.
 
Romney is correct when he says Obama wants to cover everyone; Obama has said that is his goal. But Obama has no mandate requiring that adults buy health insurance. How many people would remain uninsured has become a hot issue in the Democratic primary. (See our coverage of this issue

here

. )
 
At best, Romney is wrong on two out of three points in his attack on the Obama health plan. It's not a government takeover and the purported cost is less than what Romney stated. For these reasons, we rate Romney's statement Barely True.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Mitt Romney']","
Amnesty, amnesty, amnesty, amnesty!
","During a testy exchange in the Jan. 5, 2008, debate, John McCain accused Mitt Romney of mischaracterizing his stand on immigration by calling it ""amnesty"" for illegal immigrants.
 
Romney sternly replied, ""I don't describe your plan as amnesty in my ad. I don't call it amnesty.""
 
This denial earns Romney a Pants on Fire ruling because two ads he released in recent days use that exact language. The only thing possibly saving the former Massachusetts governor is that the ads feature other people using the controversial word, not Romney himself.
 
In a Romney ad called ""Remember"" launched on Jan. 3, a group of New Hampshire residents praise McCain's military experience and record of public service, then tick off grievances with McCain's positions on taxes and immigration. One, identified as Collett Hill, says of McCain, ""He wrote the amnesty bill that America rejected.""
 
A second Romney spot called ""Twists"" released Jan. 4 opens with an eight-year-old clip of McCain accusing George W. Bush of twisting the truth during the 2000 presidential campaign. An announcer then enumerates reasons McCain was wrong then, and why he's not as conservative as Romney. Among the reasons cited, ""Higher taxes, amnesty for illegals.""
 
If the message in ads isn't clear enough, press releases for the ads that are posted on Romney's Web site are chock-full of references to amnesty. The release for ""Remember"" uses the word 17 times, while the one for ""Twists"" drops the loaded word 10 times.
 
Clearly, Romney has two ads where McCain's plan is described as amnesty. And even though his isn't the voice making the charges, he is responsible for the message. So, Romney, they're your ads, and they do ""call it amnesty,"" so Pants on Fire it is.

"['National', 'Military', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
He ignores bipartisan support for defense cuts
","At a Republican debate in Manchester, N.H., on Jan. 5, 2008, Rudy Giuliani blamed President Clinton for shrinking the military.
 
""Bill Clinton cut the military drastically,"" Giuliani said. ""It was called the peace dividend, one of those nice-sounding phrases: very devastating. It was a 25, 30 percent cut in the military.""
 
This claim is similar to others made by Mitt Romney in campaign speeches that we have previously checked and

found were misleading.

 
In April 2007, Romney said, ""Following the end of the Cold War, President Clinton began to dismantle our military. He reduced our forces by 500,000. He retired almost 80 ships. Our spending on national defense dropped from over 6 percent of GDP to 3.8 percent today.""
 
The two Republicans are correct that military forces were reduced significantly under Clinton. The active-duty military totaled 1.8-million at the start of his presidency in 1993 and declined to 1.4-million in 2000. They are also correct that the naval fleet shrank dramatically. The Navy had 454 ships in 1993, but as vessels were retired and not replaced, the fleet was down to 341 by 2000.
 
But they are selectively choosing numbers that make it appear that the military cuts were Clinton's alone. In fact, the cuts were prompted by the end of the Cold War during the presidency of President George H.W. Bush, a Republican.
 
During Bush's presidency, he and Congress agreed to a sharp drop in military personnel. Active-duty military declined from 2.2-million to 1.8-million. Total defense forces also shrank, from 3.3-million to 2.9-million.
 
The Republicans are trying to portray Clinton and the Democrats as weak on defense and to make the peace dividend look like a partisan effort. But contrary to the Republicans' claims, the post-Cold War shrinkage of the U.S. military was very much a bipartisan effort. It began under a Republican president and a Democratic Congress and continued under a Democratic president and a Republican Congress.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Mike Huckabee']","
Voters supported the roads, not the tax
","Mike Huckabee has been telling the same story for a year. Attacked early on for raising taxes more than he cut them, Huckabee began laying the tax increases off on others. There was, for example, that matter of the 3-cent increase in the gas tax in Arkansas in 1999 accompanied by a 4-cent increase in the diesel tax, which is paid mostly by truckers.
 
""You know what we did?"" he said to George Stephanopoulos of ABC News last Feb. 11, 2007. ""We put it on the ballot, and 80 percent of the people of Arkansas voted for the fuel taxes because they wanted better roads.""
 
The voters voted all right – but not on the taxes. Instead, voters approved (by 80 percent) a $575-million bond issue that would be supported by the diesel tax and future federal highway funds. The diesel tax and the gasoline tax were going to take effect regardless of how the public voted.
 
The Arkansas legislature had approved those taxes on April 1, 1999, and the first penny of the gas tax and the first 2 cents of diesel tax were already in effect on June 15, when voters went to the polls that year. (The gas tax rose by a penny each of the next two years, the diesel tax by 2 cents the next year.)
 
The taxes and the bonds were a package plan, and Huckabee was its strong advocate. The plan to sell bonds was in Act 1027, approved by the legislature the same day as the gas tax in Act 1028.
 
Huckabee would be fully justified in arguing that the vote reflected support for the taxes that supported the plan to issue bonds.
 
In fact, he could even argue that the voters were approving the massive additional spending on roads. If the federal grants and diesel tax weren't enough to repay the bonds, the ""full faith and credit"" of the state stood behind them. As matter of fact, the gas tax wasn't directly pledged at all.
 
But you could also argue the voters had nothing to lose. Their gas tax was going up whether they approved the bonds or not. The bonds made the road-building happen much faster.
 
For Huckabee and an overwhelming majority of legislators, both Democrats and Republicans, the need was clear. That year, and again in 2000, professional truck drivers surveyed by

Overdrive

magazine rated Interstate 40 across Arkansas, between Memphis on the eastern border and Fort Smith on the Oklahoma border, the worst highway in the country. The Arkansas portion of I-30, which runs between Dallas and Little Rock, ranked fifth worst. The

Overdrive

annual survey also identified Arkansas highways as the worst overall.
 
The success of the plan is now also clear. By 2005, I-40 in Arkansas was the nation's ""most improved highway"" in the

Overdrive

survey, and I-30 was in the top five in that category.
 
""When we put that out there for the people to decide whether they wanted to affirm it, they did by an 80 percent vote,"" Huckabee said on Fox News'

Hannity & Colmes

on Nov. 15, 2007. ""I'd call that leadership.""
 
We'd also call that accurate – because of the phrase ""affirm it,"" which is closer to what voters actually did on the matter. So, does Huckabee's ""affirm"" language fix his claim as well as he fixed his roads? Alas, the myth of the approved tax continued.
 
On Dec. 30, 2007, on NBC's

Meet the Press

, Huckabee responded to rival Mitt Romney's attacks on his tax record. ""He made claims about things like tax increases,"" Huckabee said, ""but he failed to mention that some of those were either court-ordered, or they were voted on by the people and approved by the people for (such) things as roads.""
 
(The ""court-ordered"" part, which refers to a $400-million increase in the sales tax for education after the Arkansas Supreme Court threw out the state's school-financing system, is also passing the buck. The court ordered a new funding system, arguably even required more spending, but didn't order any tax increase. But that's another Truth-o-Meter.)
 
So how do we evaluate this ""voter approval"" claim? We can't understand politicians who have a real story to tell and then needlessly fudge some small piece of it.
 
Ruling: Half True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Mitt Romney']","
Yes, McCain switched
","Invoking an issue that strikes a chord with many New Hampshire voters, Mitt Romney is charging John McCain flip-flopped on tax cuts. He says McCain broke with conservative orthodoxy by voting against President Bush's 2001 and 2003 tax changes.
 
He has made the charge in news releases, speeches and, most recently, in a new ad on his Web site. You can see it

here.

 
Romney's charge, designed to raise questions with the GOP base about McCain's conservative credentials at a time when he is moving up in the polls, might resonate in the antitax state, which has neither a general sales tax nor a personal income tax.
 
We find Romney is accurately summarizing McCain's record, though he is omitting some important details.
 
McCain has long cultivated a reputation as a ""straight talk"" fiscal conservative, saying that tax cuts must be matched by spending cuts.
 
In 2001, McCain voted against a $1.35-trillion tax cut package that marked Bush's first big legislative achievement after initially supporting an alternative plan that had tighter spending limits. Two years later, McCain opposed $350-billion in additional tax cuts, saying he couldn't support cutting taxes in the face of unknown war costs. ""No one can be expected to make an informed decision about fiscal policy at this time,"" McCain said. ""Let us wait until we have succeeded in Iraq."" McCain also said he wouldn't support any spending increases that weren't related to defense or homeland security.
 
But in 2006, McCain voted to extend the Bush tax cuts for five years, saying not to do so would be tantamount to raising taxes at a time when the economy was sputtering.
 
At the time, McCain said he supported the tax-cut extensions, which reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, because ""American businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect.""
 
In an interview on Fox News on Dec. 28, 2007, he expressed no regrets about his tax votes against Bush. He said he would have preferred a plan that included spending cuts as well as tax cuts, but added that he believes the tax cuts should now be made permanent.
 
""I had significant tax cuts, and there was restraint of spending included in my proposal,"" McCain said during the appearance on

Hannity & Colmes.

""I saw no restraint in spending. We presided over the greatest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. Spending went completely out of control. It's still out of control. Wasteful earmark spending is a disgrace, and it caused us to alienate our Republican base. So these tax cuts need to be made permanent. Otherwise, they would have the effect of tax increases. But, look, if we had gotten spending under control, we'd be talking about more tax cuts today.""
 
Romney's charges must be giving McCain an uneasy sense of deja vu. The veteran senator is eager to avoid a repeat of the 2000 presidential race, when conservative interest groups questioned his loyalty to their causes and barraged him with negative ads.
 
McCain has frequently played up his fiscal conservative credentials, particularly his crusades against earmarks in spending bills and his opposition to the expensive Medicare prescription drug benefit.
 
He has responded by calling Romney a flip-flopper on taxes and other issues, but the fact remains: McCain voted the way Romney says. We find Romney's claim to be True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Ron Paul']","
It would be close to the same revenue
","Ron Paul said in December 2007 that if the government stopped collecting income tax, we would have about the same level of funding that we did 10 years ago. ""And the size of government wasn't all that bad 10 years ago,"" concluded Paul, who advocates limited government.
 
It made us wonder: Do today's tax collections, minus the income tax, really equal the tax collections of 10 years ago?
 
We asked Paul's campaign what numbers he used to arrive at that conclusion, but we didn't hear back. So we dug into IRS statistics ourselves.
 
The most recent detailed data available on income tax collected in the United States is for 2005. Besides income tax, the IRS collects corporate taxes, employment taxes, estate and gift taxes, and excise taxes.
 
After issuing refunds, the IRS collected $880-billion in individual income tax in 2005. Subtract that from total tax collections for 2005 – which equaled close to $2-trillion – and you get $1.12-trillion.
 
By comparison, total tax collections in 1995 were about $1.27-trillion.
 
Those are two big numbers that sound close. But take out the calculator: The difference between the two numbers comes to about 12 percent, and when you're talking about the federal government, that's a chunk of change – about $150-billion. To put that in perspective, it would pay for almost a year and half of the war in Iraq. Adjust for inflation, and the gap widens to a roughly 30 percent shortfall.
 
We'll concede that it's possible Paul could reduce the budget by that much, based on some of the positions he advocates. Paul has said he'd like to slash the defense budget by pulling back all U.S. troops on foreign soil, zeroing out foreign aid and reducing the size of the active military. He also advocates abolishing other federal functions, like the Department of Education.
 
Whether he makes up that 12 percent difference or not will have to wait for a Paul presidency. Meanwhile, we find his statement that ending the income tax would roll back revenues 10 years to be Mostly True.

"['National', 'Energy', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Her comparison is too selective
","Even staunch Democrats probably recall the guilty pleasure of spending their extra cash from the Bush tax cuts. And just about every American has felt the pinch at the gas pump lately.
 
So which had a bigger impact on your wallet? Are you flush from the Bush tax cuts, or did rising energy prices wipe out the fleeting boon?
 
Sen. Hillary Clinton thinks rising energy prices wiped out your family's tax savings — three times over.
Whether she's right or wrong depends on several factors.
 
""It depends on how much you drive, and how much you earn,"" said Len Burman, director of the Tax Policy Institute. (He bikes to work.)
 
Let's start with Clinton's energy number. PolitiFact doesn't know where she got it, since Clinton's camp did not respond to inquiries. But here's what we found.
 
From 2001 to 2006, ""average annual energy and gasoline costs have increased by over $2,300,"" according to ""The Middle-Class Squeeze,"" a September 2006 congressional committee report prepared for Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Henry Waxman, both California Democrats. The report included the gasoline in your car, oil to heat your home, and fuel for electricity. It also included some tough-to-measure ""pass-through"" costs, such as higher retail prices because of higher shipping costs.
 
Going by this report, Clinton's energy number seems reasonable.
 
Now, for the tax cuts. In 2001, the White House said, ""Under the President's tax relief plan, the typical American family of four will be able to keep at least $1,600 more of their own money.""
 
That's not how it necessarily worked out, said Burman. A median-income family held on to $744 in 2006 as a result of the tax cuts, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis.
 
Well, it happens that $2,300 is three times more than $744.
 
But PolitiFact finds Clinton's comparison too selective. It appears she's comparing a single year of tax savings (2006) to an escalation in energy prices that took several years.
 
What happens if you add up each year's tax savings, and then add up each year's change in energy costs? After all, oil and gas prices actually dropped in late 2001 and into 2002.
 
The answer is, we don't know. To do that kind of a calculation, over so many years, one would have to account for changing tax laws, inflation, income changes, energy use, driving patterns, what people bought, even the weather.
 
In short, it's not a number that is tracked by the Energy Information Administration or the Tax Policy Center. Maybe the Clinton campaign did all of that, but if so they're not sharing it with us.
 
We're left with somewhat accurate numbers from Clinton (judging by one report) that tell only part of the story of energy costs vs. tax savings. At our generous best, we can only give her a Half True.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'John McCain']","
Romney never said those words, but came close
","As 2007 wrapped up, Mitt Romney started airing television ads attacking John McCain, who is polling neck and neck with Romney in New Hampshire.
 
As the new year began, McCain fought back with two Web ads rapping Romney on his foreign policy experience.
 
The ads claim Romney says the next president doesn't need foreign policy experience.
 
Romney has never uttered those words, but here's what he did say on the Fox News program

Hannity & Colmes

:
 
""If we want somebody who has a lot of experience in foreign policy, we can simply go to the State Department and pluck out one of the tens of thousands of people who work there.""
 
Romney, whose comments came in the wake of the assassination of Pakistan opposition leader Benazir Bhutto, also told CNN's Anderson Cooper: ""If foreign policy experience were the measure for selecting a president, we'd just go to the State Department and pick up one of the thousands and thousands of people who've spent their whole life in foreign policy.""
 
That has become Romney's standard response to questions about his foreign policy experience. He says the nation needs a leader rather than a specialist in foreign affairs and often cites Ronald Reagan as an example of a strong leader without a foreign policy background.
 
By contrast, McCain plays up his foreign policy credentials from his time in the Senate, especially his role as an outspoken supporter of additional troops in Iraq.
 
It's clear that Romney didn't say exactly what McCain has attributed to him. It also is clear that while McCain doesn't quote him directly, he's taking Romney's words a bit too literally. The question then is how to judge the accuracy of what McCain has charged. Did Romney say a president doesn't need foreign policy experience? Mostly, yes he did.

"['National', 'Elections', 'Chris Dodd']","
Polarizing, yes, but electable, too
","During an October 2007 debate, Sen. Chris Dodd was asked about Sen. Hillary Clinton's electability, which has been a persistent question in her bid for the White House.
 
""Whether it's fair or not fair, the fact of the matter is that my colleague from New York, Senator Clinton, there are 50 percent of the American public that say they're not going to vote for her,"" Dodd said. ""We as a party certainly have to take that into consideration.""
 
Clinton and her husband, former President Bill Clinton, were reviled by some conservative segments of the electorate by the time he left office in 2001. And Gallup Organization polling has showed that the percentage of people with a negative opinion of Hillary Clinton has scored in the 40s — or higher — consistently since 2000.
 
Dodd isn't the first to question whether Clinton could win a national election, or to note how polarizing she is. Among others:
 
• ""The fact that Senator Clinton is a polarizing figure in American politics is not even a point of debate,'' said David Axelrod, a senior campaign adviser to Barack Obama. ""It's an empirical fact.''
 
• Republican strategist Karl Rove called Clinton ""fatally flawed"" because of her high negatives.
 
In the matter of Dodd's quote, a Zogby International survey released in October 2007 reported 50 percent of voters would refuse to vote for her. A Harris Poll in March 2007 had the same result.
 
However, that statistic alone doesn't tell the whole story of whether or not Clinton could win in the general election.
 
Clinton generates strong ill-will among Republicans but she also draws raves by Democrats. A Gallup Poll released Dec. 19, 2007, shows Clinton has advantages against leading Republican candidates Rudy Giuliani, Mike Huckabee and Mitt Romney in hypothetical matchups. She led most Republicans narrowly in Rasmussen Reports polling in December 2007, and in some cases better than other leading Democrats.
 
""While she may be polarizing, she is definitely electable. If Sen. Clinton is the Democratic nominee, she has a very strong base of support and very strong opposition,"" said pollster Scott Rasmussen, president of Rasmussen Reports.
 
The Gallup Poll also found that Clinton would not have to look far to find a polarizing candidate who took the White House. Her husband, Bill, won in 1992 when his negatives outstripped his positives in spring polling. George W. Bush won re-election in 2004 with high unfavorability ratings, although the Gallup Poll had higher positive ratings for him than negative ratings early in 2004.
 
In 2007, Clinton's favorability went from 48 percent in August to 51 percent in December, noted Jeffrey Jones, managing editor of the Gallup Poll.
 
""I would say with her favorability ratings now she could be electable,"" Jones said. ""It would definitely be to her advantage if the Republican Party would nominate a candidate with high unfavorability.""
 
So Dodd is accurate when he cites polls that show 50 percent of the American public won't vote for Clinton. But the rest of the story is that it's not a dealbreaker as far as electibility goes.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Joe Biden']","
He was one voice of many
","In the waning days of the Iowa campaign, dark horse Democratic candidate Sen. Joe Biden has gone to the airwaves to distinguish himself as a steady leader with broad foreign affairs experience.
 
One of his ads claims that he ended genocide in Bosnia.
 
He explained in a 1997 speech: ""Appalled by the naked Serbian aggression and genocidal attacks on Bosnian civilians, in September 1992 I called for a 'lift and strike' policy. ...
 
""My views were not widely shared at that time. As the war escalated — with massacres, 'ethnic cleansing,' and rapes — a few other senators, including Bob Dole and Joe Lieberman, joined my call for action. But it took more than two years of failed diplomacy — and a quarter-million killed and 2-million homeless — before we finally came around to the 'lift and strike' policy in the fall of 1995. Guess what? The policy worked!""
 
""Lift and strike"" is shorthand for the policy of lifting the U.S. arms embargo against the Bosnian government and launching military strikes against the Bosnian Serbs accused of genocide.
 
It's clear Biden was among the earliest and most vocal members of Congress to advocate an end to the violence. But it's wrong for him to take sole credit for ending the genocide.
 
""He was a constant pest to push people in that direction,"" said Ivo H. Daalder, a former director for European affairs on the National Security Council and author of the book

Getting to Dayton: The Making of America's Bosnia Policy.

""There is no doubt that Joe Biden wanted to end the genocide and was willing to use force to end it before either the Bush or Clinton administrations.""
 
But Biden's influence remained that of one of 100 senators, noted Daalder, who now serves as an adviser to Sen. Barack Obama's presidential campaign: ""The war was ended by a whole bunch of people, most of whom were in the administration.""
 
Indeed, it was former Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke who was nominated for a 1995 Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to bring the war in Bosnia to a close. It was Senate Majority Leader Dole who in 1995 filed the bill that Biden co-sponsored ending the arms embargo against Bosnia. Passage of that bill helped pave the way for President Bill Clinton to change his Bosnia policy.
 
NATO, led by Gen. Wesley Clark, played its role, too, as did many other U.S. and international leaders.
 
So yes, Biden wanted to stop the genocide. He played an influential role in the debate. But he didn't end the war himself, as his ad implies. We rate his statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Fred Thompson']","
The liberal label doesn't quite stick to Huckabee
","
If you take away his religious-conservative views, is Mike Huckabee a liberal?
 
Fred Thompson, competing fiercely against Huckabee for the social conservatives' vote in the Republican primaries, is using the ""liberal"" label, a favorite derogatory term at least since the Barry Goldwater presidential campaign of 1964. After using the label in an interview with Nashville talk-radio host Steve Gill, Thompson elaborated in an interview with George Stephanopoulos of ABC News on Nov. 18: ""That means he's pro-life, but he's liberal on everything else.""
 
It's not exactly a factual allegation, but Politifact decided to rise to the challenge: Can you declare a label to be true or false?
 
""He's not a liberal,"" says former Arkansas Republican Party chairman Gilbert Baker, a state senator from Conway who is supporting Huckabee. Baker notes that the Arkansas legislature is heavily Democratic. ""Did he get things accomplished – that's the question you have to ask.""
 
Baker says Huckabee was driven by a ""holistic approach"" to economic development – not just tax breaks and low taxes for businesses, but also ""energy, schools, higher education. He made a great effort to improve the economic development climate here.""
 
""The labels liberal and conservative just don't work for Mike Huckabee,"" says Thomas E. Mann of the Brookings Institution in Washington, a widely respected political scientist who studies federal politics and government. ""He appears to be a bad fit with all of the dominant interests in the Republican party except for the religious conservatives.""
 
Huckabee's religious beliefs also produce some policies not considered conservative. Huckabee has said he believes in being ""a good steward of the earth."" Political consultant Dick Morris, who advised Bill Clinton's presidential campaign as well as Huckabee's runs for lieutenant governor in 1993 and 1996, recalls Huckabee's response to a question about parole for felons. ""The Christian concept of forgiveness requires that we allow parole. We just have to use it wisely.""
 
""Governor Huckabee has consistently supported and initiated measures that increase government's interference in markets, thereby impeding economic growth,"" says the Club for Growth, which on Nov. 13 complained of ""his liberal economic record.""
 
The club's indictment says he raised the minimum wage in Arkansas from the federal $5.15 an hour to $6.25, threatened an investigation of price-gouging if gas prices went up after 9/11, and ordered regulators to investigate price-gouging in nursing homes. In 1997, he ""signed a bill into law that would prevent companies from raising their prices a mere 10% ahead of a natural disaster,"" with roof repair and tree removal among the targets.
 
Huckabee has touted his ""Property Taxpayers' Bill of Rights and cuts in income taxes and capital gains taxes in the early years of his administration. But the Club for Growth says Huckabee's ""substantial tax hikes far surpassed his modest tax cuts.""
 
The anti-tax Cato Institute gave Huckabee a ""D"" for his tenure as governor. They're a tough bunch to please. Even conservative icon Jeb Bush, the governor of Florida during the last eight years Huckabee was governor of Arkansas, earned no better than a lifetime ""B,"" and a ""C"" for his final year. (Mitt Romney earned a lifetime ""C."")
 
Does all that render one a liberal? If you are not consistently ""conservative,"" are you liberal? Can you oppose withdrawal from Iraq, as Huckabee does, and still be liberal? Can you support a flat sales tax in place of a progressive income tax and still be liberal?
 
Maybe a later Republican label fits: ""compassionate conservative."" George W. Bush used that one in his 2000 campaign. Cato's director of health and welfare studies, Michael Tanner, says unflatteringly that Huckabee resembles Bush in his ""big-government conservatism.""
 
But ""pro-life liberal""? Pro-life seems an intentionally narrow description of Huckabee's strong ""values"" positions. And ""liberal"" is a clear exaggeration, especially if it means ""on everything else,"" though you can't deny liberal elements in his populism. Keeping in mind the subjective nature of the term, we rate Thompson's ""pro-life liberal"" label as no better than half-true.
