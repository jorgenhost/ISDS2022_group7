Brit Hume: Media overlooked 'terrible concussion' comments by Bill Clinton
","The top political story from the week was Karl Rove’s comments about Hillary Clinton’s health following a concussion she suffered in December 2012. On the Sunday shows, there was much talk about whether the country should spend much time talking about Clinton’s health. Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume said there is more to be learned and noted that former President Bill Clinton himself revealed that the concussion was ""terrible"" and required six months of treatment. Hume said that is ""new news"" that had been ""widely overlooked."" While Bill Clinton’s quip that Republicans thought Hillary Clinton is auditioning for a part on The Walking Dead ""was reported everywhere,"" Hume said, ""the part where he said that she underwent what I guess was six months of physical therapy to recover from the concussion, a ‘terrible concussion,’ was new news. And of course, it was widely overlooked."" In this fact-check, we examine whether, as Hume said, much of the media failed to report those additional details from President Clinton. Television and cable Fox News had an interview segment specifically about Clinton’s reference to six months and a terrible concussion but fans of other networks got a similar message. ABC News said Clinton went beyond defending his wife. ""The former president revealed that his wife’s injury 'required six months of very serious work to get over,' he said during a question-and-answer session at the Peterson Foundation in Washington. ""'They went to all this trouble to say she had staged what was a terrible concussion that required six months of very serious work to get over,' he said. 'It’s something she never low-balled with the American people, never tried to pretend it didn’t happen.'"" CNN noted that Clinton had shared details that guaranteed the issue would remain alive. ""But he went on to say this, proving this was no minor fall: 'She had sustained what was a terrible concussion. Required six months of very serious work to get over.'"" CBS News presented Clinton’s words in full. ""'She certainly seems to have more stamina now and there's nothing to it,' Clinton said during a question and answer session with PBS' Gwen Ifill. 'I was sort of dumbfounded. They went to all this trouble to say she had staged what was a terrible concussion that required six months of very serious work to get over, something she never lowballed with the American people, never tried to pretend didn't happen.'"" NBC News, MSNBC, and PBS all presented similar accounts. NBC Nightly News included Clinton’s quote during its broadcast as did PBS NewsHour. We also found mentions on CNN’s Out Front and MSNBC’s PoliticsNation and The Ed Show. Major newspapers and wire services Ditto basically for major U.S. newspapers and wire services. The Associated Press led with Bill Clinton’s reference to a long recovery. ""Former President Bill Clinton said Wednesday his wife Hillary took six months to recover from a 2012 concussion, adding she is now 'stronger than I am' as he dismissed GOP strategist Karl Rove's comments about her health."" Hundreds of print and broadcast services across the country carry the AP’s stories. The New York Times noted in its coverage the significance of everything Clinton said. ""He did acknowledge that Mrs. Clinton had suffered a 'very serious concussion,' and that it had taken her months to fully recover."" The Wall Street Journal: Mr. Clinton, speaking at a forum on budget issues Wednesday in Washington, also offered some fresh insights into the December 2012 incident, saying that Hillary Clinton suffered a 'terrible concussion' that entailed 'six months of very serious work' toward recovery. The Los Angeles Times did not give top billing to the detail about six months of recovery but did report it. The New York Daily News included the former president’s description, writing, ""She endured six months of ‘very serious work’"" to recover from a concussion and blood clot but now ‘she is strong; she is doing great,’ he (Clinton) said."" Online news services Ditto, too, for major online websites. The liberal Huffington Post had a story with this headline: ""Bill Clinton Insults Rove, But Acknowledges Hillary's Health Is 'Serious Issue'."" ""The 42nd president also revealed that he knows questions about his wife's health and age can't be ignored as the 2016 presidential race comes into focus. In fact, he called it 'a serious issue.'"" A few sentences later, the article quoted Clinton in full, speaking of ""a terrible concussion"" that ""required six months of serious work to get over."" Politico also provided Clinton’s complete description in the third paragraph of its article. Talking Points Memo mentioned the six-month recovery period, although further down in its story. Our ruling Hume said much of the media overlooked that Bill Clinton said his wife had suffered a terrible concussion that required six months of work before she recovered. While Bill Clinton’s Walking Dead zinger may have gotten more airtime (we didn’t check), Hume is wrong to assert that the media ignored Clinton’s substantive comments. Clinton’s comments were covered in print by the nation’s biggest newspapers, in online articles, and on the TV networks and elsewhere. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ABD400>],/factchecks/2014/may/18/brit-hume/brit-hume-media-overlooked-terrible-concussion-com/
"['Rhode Island', 'Economy', 'Poverty', 'Robert Malin']","
R.I. anti-poverty activist says fifty percent of Americans will go hungry at some time in their lives
","Millions of people go hungry in the United States every year, despite this being one of the world’s wealthiest nations. But quantifying the problem is difficult. Robert Malin, an activist with the newly formed Rhode Island Mobilization Against Poverty, offered his view last month: ""Fifty percent of Americans will go hungry at some time in their lives,"" he said during a discussion April 20, 2014, on WJAR-TV’s ""10 News Conference."" An activist, Malin was with Occupy Providence, which occupied the city’s downtown Burnside Park in 2011 as part of the national grassroots movement. When we asked Malin the basis for his claim, he cited ""Transitioning In and Out of Poverty,"" a 2009 report  by the Washington, D.C.-based Urban Institute. Malin directed us to this statement: ""Slightly more than half of the U.S. population experiences poverty at some time before the age of 65."" That’s very different from what Malin said. Poverty and hunger often correlate. But experts - including the report’s author - underscore that they are not one and the same. The U.S. Department of Agriculture and many nonprofit or non-governmental organizations use the term ""food insecurity,"" that is, ""people who lack consistent access to adequate food and are unable at times during the year to acquire adequate food because they lack sufficient money or resources."" Plainly stated: they have difficulty putting food on the table. The USDA defines hunger as a physiological condition ""that might result from food insecurity."" A government panel has recommended a national assessment of hunger. Caroline Ratcliffe, co-author of the Urban Institute Report that Malin cites, said, ""The 50 percent number that he quotes echoes findings in the poverty literature that half of the population will be poor before 65."" ""The percentage of Americans who experience poverty and economic hardship is very high. What we also know, but isn’t exactly the number he cites, is that people who are poor - a lot of them are food insecure,"" Ratcliffe said. The numbers ""move together, but they are not the same thing,"" Ratcliffe said. We also interviewed Alisha J. Coleman-Jensen, PhD, a sociologist with the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Economic Research Service and author of numerous articles and reports on household food insecurity. That includes ""Household Food Security in the United States in 2012."" In 2012, ""by our estimate, 14.5 percent of households were food insecure,"" she said. That translates to roughly 49 million people in 17.6 million households. Of those, ""5.7 percent of households are at a high risk for food insecurity, meaning they are not getting enough to eat, have disrupted eating patterns or go whole days without food.Those numbers are ""not anywhere near 50 percent."" As for Malin’s claim, ""I don’t know where that’s from ... I haven’t seen that figure anywhere."" Coleman-Jensen wondered aloud if Malin had misinterpreted the close to 50 million people living in food-insecure households as 50 percent. ""If they’re talking about somebody going hungry at any point in their lives … we do not have data that would allow us to measure the percent of people who will experience food insecurity or low food security ‘at some point in their lives.’’’ She noted that ""our data [are] for a single year."" Mark R. Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University, in St. Louis, has conducted research that found that half of all American children will at some point be in a household that uses food stamps. But he said he knew of no studies that addressed lifetime risk of hunger. ""One could argue that if you’re using food stamps you’re at risk of experiencing hunger, but that would be as far as one could go,"" Rank said. Kathleen Gorman, director of the University of Rhode Island’s Feinstein Center for a Hunger-Free America, says she does not find Malin’s statement unreasonable, ""but it is extremely difficult to prove.""   ""First of all, we do not have any good measures of ‘hunger’ -- it is a pretty amorphous idea.  When we measure hunger, we typically use the USDA Household Food Security survey -- and while they are not identical, most people accept that one is an indicator of the other,"" she said.   Our ruling Anti-poverty activist Robert Malin said half of all Americans will go hungry at some point in their lives. Experts we talked with knew of no research that supported Malin’s claim. And studies show the percentage of Americans facing ""food insecurity"" annually is closer to 15 percent. Some studies, however, have found that half of all Americans will be poor at some point in their lives. And researchers say hunger and poverty are linked. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False. (Correction: Robert Malin is an activist with the Rhode Island Mobilization Against Poverty. The initial version of this item incorrectly said he was the head of the organization.)",[<zip object at 0x00000280976A6400>],/factchecks/2014/may/18/robert-malin/ri-anti-poverty-activist-says-fifty-percent-americ/
"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Jim Francesconi']","
Does Multnomah County have 90,000 people who are unemployed or underemployed?
","Income inequality is a hot topic both nationally and in Multnomah County, where Jim Francesconi has made it a central theme in his race against Deborah Kafoury and four other candidates for chair of the Multnomah County Board of Commissioners. Using campaign themes of ""Moving Forward Together"" and ""Leaving No One Behind,"" Francesconi has said he will focus heavily on job creation if elected. The claim: Francesconi’s campaign website describes him as a ""champion of workers’ rights"" and highlights a jobs plan. It also includes the claim that the county is still recovering from the Great Recession. ""Economic inequality in Multnomah County has a face -- and a name,"" according to one item. ""It has 90,000 faces and names -- the number of county residents who are still unemployed, or underemployed, in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street crash."" Does Multnomah County have 90,000 residents who are unemployed or underemployed? We checked. The analysis: We contacted Francesconi’s campaign and asked about the statistic. They sent an email containing several sources, including the annual and quarterly reports of a nonprofit agency that tracks employment data and a link to a U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics table showing ""underutilized"" labor for every state. However, the crux of his claim was contained in a news article that put county unemployment at 91,600 as of March 2013. We checked that by calling Amy Vander Vliet, a regional economist with the Oregon Employment Department. Her department is responsible for compiling and publishing the state’s official employment numbers. The correct figure for Multnomah County unemployment at the time Francesconi’s campaign published its claim, she said, is 27,800. The 91,600 figure, she said, appears to come from a category labeled ""Portland Metro"" unemployment in a report issued by Worksystems, a nonprofit agency that deals with employment in Multnomah and Washington counties. The greater Portland metro area, for the agency’s reporting purposes, is comprised of seven counties, including Multnomah. We then checked the campaign’s other sources -- Worksystems’ annual State of the Workforce and its quarterly report, issued in October 2013. We checked both. The annual report did not mention ""underemployment."" Vander Vliet verified that. The quarterly report, which included data through the end of September 2013, said a combined 68,000 people in Washington and Multnomah counties were underemployed as of that time. Vander Vliet said she could not vouch for the figure because her department doesn’t provide county-by-county information tracking underemployment. We called Rick McKay, senior project manager at Worksystems, who came up with the 68,000 figure. He said it’s based on a sampling of telephone interviews his agency conducts. ""It’s a back-of-the-envelope kind of number,"" he said. ""But it’s somewhere in that neighborhood."" McKay estimated that about 60 percent of the 68,000 underemployed people live in Multnomah County. That would put the figure at 40,800. Clearly, that number isn’t statistically valid, but if added to the 27,800 people who are unemployed in the county, we get 68,600 people who are either unemployed or underemployed in Multnomah County. That’s considerably shy of the 90,000 figure on Francesconi’s campaign website. We asked the campaign about the discrepancy and received in reply a spreadsheet showing the number of people living below the federal poverty line in every county in the country. The numbers, taken from federal statistics, put the figure at 136,065 for Multnomah County. However, those numbers don’t take into account that many of those people, even if at or near the federal poverty level, are employed. In addition, federal poverty statistics have nothing to do with any of the sources the campaign originally provided. Our ruling: Jim Francesconi, now running for Multnomah County chair, says on his campaign website that 90,000 people in the county are either unemployed or underemployed in the wake of the 2008 Wall Street crash. His campaign, when asked, pointed to several sources to justify the number. One source, which the campaign could have verified, gave an incorrect figure for the number of unemployed workers in the county. Another, contrary to what the campaign asserted, made no mention of underemployed workers. A third cited a figure for underemployment, but the person who compiled the figure acknowledged it was an ""estimate on an estimate."" Taking that estimate and adding it to the number of unemployed in the county gives us a figure of 68,600 -- a lot, obviously, but far short of the 90,000 listed by Francesconi. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976A6B00>],/factchecks/2014/may/16/jim-francesconi/does-multnomah-county-have-90000-people-who-are-un/

Trey Gowdy said the United States was 'the last flag flying in Benghazi'
","Rep. Trey Gowdy -- the South Carolina Republican tapped by House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, to head the newly established House Select Committee on Benghazi -- has begun sharing some of the questions he plans to investigate. Gowdy’s panel is charged with looking into the Sept. 11, 2012, attack on a U.S. government complex in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. During an appearance on Fox News Sunday on May 11, 2014, host Chris Wallace asked Gowdy, ""So, tell me the single biggest question you want to ask"" former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Gowdy responded, ""Why were we still in Benghazi? The British ambassador was almost assassinated. Our facility was attacked twice. There were multiple episodes of violence. We were the last flag flying in Benghazi, and I would like to know why."" The notion that the United States was ""the last flag"" in Benghazi has been echoed by other Republican critics of the Obama administration’s actions before, during and after the Benghazi attack. Now, with the head of the Benghazi panel citing it as one of his top investigative priorities, we thought we’d check it out. We quickly found contrary evidence in a report issued by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence on Jan. 15, 2014. The report stated that ""although some countries and international organizations had reduced their presence in Benghazi, the United States maintained a diplomatic presence there similar to the UN, the European Union, and other Western countries such as Italy, France, Turkey, and Malta."" The report footnoted this claim to a Dec. 6, 2013, email from the State Department to the Senate committee. ""I think the Senate report is a fine source"" for this sort of information, said Thomas Joscelyn, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, a group founded by conservatives and hawkish Democrats. ""I doubt the Democrats were in cahoots to lie about this sort of thing. Absent any contrary evidence, I don't see any reason to doubt the Senate report on this."" Joscelyn then dug a little further and provided us with some additional evidence. On Jan. 12, 2013 -- four months after the attack on the U.S. complex -- the vehicle of the Italian consul general was attacked by terrorists in Benghazi. No one was injured, but according to the State Department, the attack on the Italian diplomat was carried out by terrorists who ""had a role in the 2012 attacks against U.S. facilities."" Then, on Oct. 11, 2013, a car bomb in Benghazi caused severe damage to the building housing the joint honorary consulates of Finland and Sweden. There were no injuries or casualties. All told, then, it seems that other nations also had a footprint in Benghazi just before the attack on the United States’ complex, and continued to have one afterward. So where did the notion that ""we were the last flag flying in Benghazi"" come from? When we checked with Gowdy’s staff, they pointed us to testimony given by Lt. Col. Andrew Wood, who was stationed in Libya as a site security team commander in Libya from February 2012 to August 2012. He testified before the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee when it was investigating the Benghazi attack in October 2012. Wood’s testimony appears to be the source of the vivid phrase ""last flag flying in Benghazi."" Here’s what he told the committee: ""The British consulate moved out when I was there, and they actually had (a memorandum of understanding) with us to leave their weapons and vehicles on our compound there in Benghazi. They would come back and occupy at times, draw their weapons and vehicles, and do their work, and return them and leave. The attack on the International Red Cross was another attack that also involved us and threats to the compound there in Benghazi. The threats were made on Facebook to both the remaining Western influences there in Benghazi, being the Red Cross and the U.S. Embassy compound. The Red Cross was attacked with rocket-propelled grenades in early June. When it was attacked a second time, I believe they made the decision they were going to give up and leave Benghazi. When that occurred, it was apparent to me that we were the last flag flying in Benghazi. We were the last thing on their target list to remove from Benghazi."" We reached Wood, who is now back at his job with the federal Bureau of Reclamation in Utah. By phone, Wood said that when he used the phrase ""last flag flying in Benghazi,"" he was specifically referring to the three western institutions mentioned in the threats on Facebook -- the British and United States diplomatic complexes and the Red Cross facility. In other words, Wood didn’t literally mean there was no other western presence in Benghazi -- rather, he was referring to the United States as the last of the three specifically cited targets to be attacked. So by Wood’s account, the United States wasn’t literally the last western entity in Benghazi -- though it was one of the last, operating a higher-profile and more permanent facility than the other nations that remained on the ground. For instance, Wood said he recalls Turkey having a presence in Benghazi -- ""Amb. Stevens went to meet with Turkish diplomats there,"" he said — but he said the Turks tended to put people on the ground periodically and ""for a specific reason."" France, for its part, would ""rent a villa and send their diplomats, then wrap it all up and leave no trace."" Wood said that, in his view, the truth lies ""somewhere in the middle"" between the Senate report (which glosses over the impermanence of some of the western operations in Benghazi) and Gowdy’s claim that the United States was literally the last western entity in the city. Our ruling Gowdy said the United States had ""the last flag flying in Benghazi."" Some nations, such as the United Kingdom, had abandoned Benghazi or limited their footprint prior to the attack on the United States complex. But like a game of telephone, the meaning of the phrase Gowdy used shifted from its original meaning as politicians embraced it as an evocative talking point. In his testimony, Wood used the phrase more rhetorically than literally, explaining that the United States was the last of three western institutions that had been mentioned in a terrorist threat to be attacked. In fact, there’s clear evidence that several other western nations had a presence in Benghazi immediately before and well after the attack on the U.S. compound. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DA8300>],/factchecks/2014/may/16/trey-gowdy/trey-gowdy-says-we-were-last-flag-flying-benghazi/

Sean Hannity: The Koran says 'don't take Christians and Jews as your friends”
","International concern seems to mount by the day for nearly 300 Nigerian schoolgirls held captive by Boko Haram, a militant Islamist group whose name means ""Western education is forbidden."" After threatening to sell the girls into slavery, a video released this week purports to show about 100 of them in full-length, black veils. The group leader says the girls converted from Christianity to Islam and will not be released unless imprisoned Boko Haram members are freed. Fox News host Sean Hannity isn’t the only pundit to denounce the group’s actions. He convened a panel on his May 12 show, which included liberal The Five co-host Bob Beckel, to criticize liberals touting the #BringBackOurGirls Twitter campaign supported by first lady Michelle Obama. We’ve seen conservatives offer similar criticisms in recent days, from Rush Limbaugh to Ann Coulter. Hannity took the discussion a step further, wondering if most Muslims subscribe to beliefs shared by Boko Haram. Beckel entered the conversation by saying the response from ""supposedly moderate"" heads of Muslim states has been weak. ""I tried to call the Egyptian embassy and I called the Saudi embassy to ask for a comment about these 275 girls and got nothing from them! When is a cleric, when is an imam, finally going to stand up and say, ‘this is wrong’?"" That’s when Hannity took over. ""Do you think that this is general acceptance? When you read the Koran it talks about don’t take Christians and Jews as your friends. It talks about jihad. It talks about apostate. All these things are in there. And do you think most Muslims buy into this radicalism, or (are) there moderate Muslims that are intimidated?"" Our question: Does the Koran talk about ""don’t take Christians and Jews as your friends""?   What is he talking about? A Fox News spokesperson said Hannity was talking about verse 5:51 of the Koran, the sacred book of Muslims. It’s a verse that has spawned blog posts and message board queries about what it really means. The original Koran (also Quran) is in Arabic, and Muslims believe it to be the word of Allah spoken to the prophet Mohammad via the angel Gabriel over a 23-year period. Just as there are multiple English translations for the Bible, there are also English translations of the Koran, and experts are split on which translations are best and true to the Arabic text -- and on whether it should be translated at all. Interpretations are subjective, as not every word in Arabic has a flawless English equivalent. ""Scripture is not some sort of religious instruction manual that believers ingest uniformly and uncritically,"" says Kenneth Garden, a University of Tufts assistant professor of religion. ""It inspires, yes, but it is also malleable and open to creative readings that highlight some passages and ignore others in ways we could never predict."" Still, the Quranic Arabic Corpus, a website that allows users to select passages from the Koran and compare parallel translations, offers several English translations of verse 5:51. Here are a few we found: Saheeh International: ""O you who have believed, do not take the Jews and the Christians as allies. They are (in fact) allies of one another. And whoever is an ally to them among you -- then indeed, he is (one) of them. Indeed, Allah guides not the wrongdoing people."" Arberry: ""O believers, take not Jews and Christians as friends; they are friends of each other. Whoso of you makes them his friends is one of them. God guides not the people of the evildoers."" The Noble Qur'an: ""O you who believe! Take not the Jews and the Christians as Auliya' (friends, protectors, helpers, etc.), they are but Auliya' to one another. And if any amongst you takes them as Auliya', then surely he is one of them. Verily, Allah guides not those people who are the Zalimun (polytheists and wrong­doers and unjust)."" The Message of The Quran says: ""O you who have attained to faith! Do not take the Jews and Christians for your allies: they are but allies of one another -- and whoever of you allies himself with them becomes, verily, one of them; behold, God does not guide such evildoers."" Most but not all of these translations refer to friends while another says allies. Is the meaning as simple as it seems? Lost in translation? What did the experts say? Reactions ranged from Hannity is partially right to wildly wrong. ""Certainly 5:51 and other verses like it are great material for a group like Boko Haram to use,"" Garden said, while noting other verses contain messages of tolerance and warnings. ""But apart from God speaking in a booming voice from on high and telling us how he would like the Koran to be interpreted, there is no objective way to say which is the correct reading of the scripture."" Let’s start with the translation that introduces the word ""Auliya’."" Other versions use ""friends,"" but that word connotes a sense of, well, friendliness that, according to some experts and opinions, isn’t supposed to be reflected in the text. ""Auliya’"" does not mean friends in the way of pals or companions. It’s meaning is more about allies, protectors or guardians. One footnote to this passage in The Message version of the Koran says ""this prohibition of a ‘moral alliance’ with non-Muslims does not constitute an injunction against normal, friendly relations with such of them as are well-disposed towards Muslims."" Broader historical context is key, experts told us. The verse refers to a specific period of tribal society in Mohammed’s time, one marked by interreligious strife in which some Muslims in Medina were considering siding with certain Jewish tribes, said John L. Esposito, author of What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam and founding director of Georgetown University’s Prince Alwaleed Bin Talal Center for Muslim-Christian Understanding. ""What Hannity is doing is just cherry-picking a passage,"" Esposito said. ""It would be the equivalent of taking any of the statements in the Old Testament where God tells his people to fight and kill."" ""The order here is not to take them as guardians or protectors,"" said Khaleel Mohammed, a San Diego State University professor who has compared English translations of the Koran. ""Incidentally, the word for ‘guardian’ in Arabic and in Islamic terminology is ‘wali,’ the singular of Awliya.""   Reading the passage as Muslims cannot be friends with Christians and Jews flies in the face of the general treatment of those religions in the Koran, Esposito said. The different faiths share a connection to Abraham and a belief in the monotheistic God, and Islam acknowledges the word of God also coming in the Torah, Psalms and Gospels of the Bible. ""It contradicts the principle that both Christians and Jews are considered ‘ahl al-kitab,’ the people of the book,"" said Taoufik Ben Amor, Columbia University senior lecturer in Arabic studies. ""Muslims can marry (Christians and Jews), trade, and coexist without forcing them to convert."" What’s more relevant, some argued, is how most Muslims interpret the verse. Even though some radical Muslims may agree with Hannity’s interpretation, most moderate Muslims believe it’s a great thing to be friends with Jews and Christians, said Martha Schulte-Nafeh, University of Michigan Arabic program director. The quote Hannity pulled is ""not the normative understanding of how Muslims are with people of other faith,"" said Edgar Hopida, spokesman for the Islamic Society of North America. Our ruling In a segment condemning Boko Haram, Hannity said the Koran contains a verse that ""talks about don't take Christians and Jews as your friends."" While some English translations of the Koran do include a similar phrase, some experts say Hannity is isolating the phrase out of its proper context. Also there is a debate if the true meaning of the passage is somehow altered in the translation itself. Much of the meaning depends on how people interpret scripture, which can be said for any spiritual text. Hannity’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097173C40>],/factchecks/2014/may/16/sean-hannity/sean-hannity-koran-says-dont-take-christians-and-j/

Jeb Bush says U.S. teenagers behind Ireland, Poland and Vietnam in math and science
","One part of former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush’s resume sets him apart from many of the other potential Republican presidential contenders: a longstanding focus on education policy. As he travels around the country giving speeches -- and titillating political journalists and donors -- Bush has highlighted some of the education policies he advocated during his gubernatorial tenure, which relied heavily on achievement benchmarks, and chastised those who resisted. Bush likes to remind audiences how far Florida came on education benchmarks and how far the nation still has to go to raise its standards. During a May 12 speech at the Manhattan Institute for Policy Research, a conservative think-tank, Bush said the U.S. lags behind other countries -- including some unexpected nations -- on some key educational measures. ""There is nothing more critical to our long-term economic security than a wholesale transformation of our education system,"" Bush said. ""The latest results from the Program for International Student Assessment, better known as PISA, only confirm the urgency of our charge."" He continued, ""U.S. teenagers have now fallen behind their counterparts in Ireland, Poland and even Vietnam in math and science. Between 2003 and 2012, the United States flatlined its results, but many other countries have made a command focus on this. ... There have been more resources placed in this, and they have higher expectations of their children, and they have gotten a better result. So for those that think … poverty is the reason why we haven’t had the educational gains, I guess we should really look to the wealthy countries like Vietnam to determine whether we should be successful. Come on!"" We thought we’d check whether Bush was correct that teenagers in Ireland, Poland and Vietnam rank higher than their U.S. counterparts in math and science. International comparison data  Bush cited the 2012 Program for International Student Assessment, or PISA, which includes every member country of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- a group of advanced industrialized nations -- as well as some non-member countries. In the United States, PISA is conducted by the federal government’s National Center for Education Statistics. The United States sampled schools nationwide. For the United States and the countries Bush cited, the data includes students at both public and private schools. PISA compares 15-year-olds from more than 60 countries in math, science and reading every three years. The study rates students’ levels of proficiency between 1 and 6 -- with 6 being the highest. Nine percent of U.S. teenagers achieved the PISA math proficiency level 5 or higher, while in Poland it was 17 percent, Vietnam 13 percent and Ireland 11 percent. In science, 7 percent of U.S. teenagers achieved the PISA science proficiency level 5 or higher. In Poland and Ireland, 11 percent of teenagers hit that mark. In Vietnam, however, the percent hitting that proficiency level was 8. That’s just one point above the United States, a level that’s not considered ""measurably different,"" according to a research analyst at NCES. Education experts weigh in on PISA We sent Bush’s claim to a few education experts and asked whether they had any concerns about the PISA evaluations or Bush’s interpretations of the data. ""Unfortunately (for the country), he is dead right,"" said Eric Hanushek, a senior fellow at Stanford University and co-author of a book that includes a discussion of how such international test results are related to economic growth. ""I am convinced that it is a good index of important skills, particularly the math and science scores."" Jason Amos, a spokesman for the Alliance for Excellent Education, a policy organization that focuses on at-risk high school students, said Bush ""is citing PISA correctly."" University of Iowa education professor David Bills said, ""The big question for me is that the distribution in the U.S. is so different than the countries we’re being compared with. The U.S. just tolerates a lot of really low achievement, overwhelmingly among poorer kids."" While top American students are internationally competitive, ""relative to other countries we badly underinvest in poor kids,"" Bills said. ""That tends to bring the overall mean down, mainly because U.S. scores are just much more skewed than they are elsewhere."" Like any educational assessment, PISA does have its critics, and much of the criticism has focused on either a general backlash against the ""escalation of testing"" or debate about whether PISA’s No. 1 ranking of China stems from its focus on Shanghai, a comparatively wealthy city. Yong Zhao, University of Oregon education professor, has written several blog posts critical of PISA, saying the comparison ""glorifies educational authoritarianism."" Zhao told PolitiFact that the statistics cited by Bush are correct. However, he said that his statement that U.S. teenagers ""have now fallen behind"" counterparts in Ireland, Poland and Vietnam is misleading. ""The U.S. PISA rankings were below Ireland and Poland in 2003, and Vietnam did not participate until 2012. So the U.S. has not fallen behind. ... in terms of international test scores, the U.S. has always had poor performance, behind many countries. So there is no ""falling behind."" (You can read more about his argument in his ""Numbers can lie""  blog.) Our ruling Bush said that ""U.S. teenagers have now fallen behind their counterparts in Ireland, Poland and even Vietnam in math and science."" Bush correctly cites data from PISA showing the United States trails the three countries in question. But it’s not so much that the United States has ""fallen behind"" -- the U.S. has been behind Ireland and Poland for years, and Vietnam was first tested in 2012. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097173740>],/factchecks/2014/may/15/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-us-teenagers-behind-ireland-poland-a/

Texas Senate votes cited by Dan Patrick didn't expand benefits to illegal immigrants
","Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst has presided over Texas Senate approval of numerous changes in law including, his Republican challenger says, proposals benefiting illegal immigrants. State Sen. Dan Patrick of Houston, who faces Dewhurst in a primary runoff for the party’s lieutenant governor nomination, said in a TV ad posted online April 28, 2014, that under Dewhurst’s leadership, the ""Senate passed an expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants."" A follow-up ad, posted online May 13, 2014, is more dramatic, saying Dewhurst ""gave illegal immigrants free Obama-style health care."" This claim by Patrick, who has hammered his intent to secure the Texas-Mexico border, misreads Senate actions. Let's plow the parts--on tuition, then health care--back to back. An ‘expansion of in-state tuition … to illegal immigrants’ Dewhurst assumed his gavel-wielding post in 2003. That was two years after lawmakers and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to make it possible for undocumented residents to attend public colleges at in-state tuition rates. Patrick, in a backup document for his tuition claim, said he was referring to a 2005 Senate-approved measure; his campaign manager, Logan Spence, sent us emails pointing out news stories and a University of Texas at Austin web page stating  the proposal ""expanded"" the benefits of the 2001 law permitting undocumented students to qualify for in-state tuition. Best we could tell, though, Senate Bill 1528, which was signed into law by Perry in 2005, simply preserved the 2001 law while otherwise making it possible for all students to qualify for in-state tuition even if their parents have moved out of state. Wondering if we missed something, we turned to the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board and the University of Texas. Dominic Chavez, a board staff spokesman, responded by emailing us a May 31, 2005, staff analysis of the final version of the 2005 proposal. The analysis states that international students (doubling as legal U.S. nonresidents) who had previously been accustomed to paying in-state tuition would be required to pay nonresident rates, at least temporarily, narrowing access for those students, Chavez told us. Those changes were then projected to save the state more than $2.8 million a year. More broadly, according to the analysis, the proposal defined terms such as tuition, mandatory fees and residency toward ensuring consistency in what institutions charged students. Finally, the analysis said, the measure would allow citizens and legal permanent residents to establish residency in the state on the same basis afforded students coming to Texas universities from abroad. This was described as simplifying the ""residency determination of students whose parents have recently moved out of state, while the student stayed behind and completed secondary education. At present, a student who has never lived anywhere but Texas becomes a nonresident if his or her parent moves out of state prior to the student’s enrollment in a public institution of higher education,"" the analysis said. Chavez, asked if the proposal expanded benefits for illegal immigrants, said that possibility wasn’t explored as lawmakers finished drafting the law. He said the agency has no data to gauge if the law delivered new benefits to undocumented students. Dewhurst campaign spokeswoman Eliza Vielma responded to our inquiry by pointing out an October 2013 ""overview"" document of the 2005 law issued by the coordinating board stating the law focused on tuition for U.S. citizens. The 2013 summary said: ""Prior to these amendments, many U.S. citizens were inadvertently prevented from attaining Texas residency status because of unanticipated circumstances. For example, students born and raised in Texas but whose parents moved out of state before they had enrolled in college were previously classified as nonresidents unless they had enrolled in college prior to their parents’ departure. Additionally,"" the agency wrote, ""students raised by grandparents or other family members who had never gone to court to acquire legal custody were considered residents of the state in which their parents lived. Current statutes allow students in both of these cases, and other similar circumstances, to qualify for Texas resident status."" The UT-Austin web page cited by Patrick as supporting his declaration about the 2005 law is vague, first describing the effect of the 2001 law enabling undocumented students to attain in-state tuition and then turning to the 2005 changes: ""In 2005, the Texas Legislature approved Senate Bill 1528, which expanded the benefits of House Bill 1403,"" the 2001 measure, the web page says. But UT's page doesn’t say how the changes widened benefits of the 2001 law. And when we followed up with UT, admissions official Deana Williams said by phone that any interpretation of the law as expanding any tuition benefit for undocumented residents would be incorrect. She said the legislation simply made it so any student--a U.S. citizen, legal resident or unauthorized resident--could pay in-state tuition even if their parents moved out of state. An ‘expansion of… free health care to illegal immigrants’ Patrick tied his claim that Dewhurst presided over Senate approval of an expansion of free health care to illegal immigrants to the Senate’s 2003 voice-vote passage of Senate Bill 309, which a May 5, 2003, Senate Journal entry summarized as ""providing health care services without regard to a person's immigration status."" The proposal said a city, county or public hospital ""may use money from  local sources to provide health care services to a person without regard to the person's immigration status and shall establish a cost-share system for persons receiving health care services."" At an April 2003 committee hearing on the proposal, authoring Sen. Mario Gallegos, D-Houston, said it permitted hospitals to draw on local revenue to provide preventive services to residents regardless of a patient’s immigration standing. Sylvia Garcia, then a Harris County commissioner, testified the proposal would hasten outpatient services, heading off health problems early and saving money thanks to fewer emergency-room visits. Proponents described the legislation as vital after the then-Texas attorney general, John Cornyn, issued an advisory opinion in July 2001 stating that unless lawmakers allowed the Harris County Hospital District (and others, presumably) to deliver preventive services to patients regardless of immigration status, the district couldn’t give such care without violating the federal Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996, which required state legislatures to intervene if states wanted hospitals to go ahead and do so. Notably, Cornyn’s letter made it clear some health services already were provided patients regardless of immigration status--as mandated by federal law. Cornyn’s letter said the district was required by law to provide emergency care to residents regardless of their legal status. By email, spokesman Lance Lunsford of the Texas Hospital Association, which describes itself as the political and educational advocate for more than 430 hospitals and health systems statewide, told us a federal law from the 1980s, the Emergency Medical Treatment & Labor Act, made free emergency care available to illegal immigrants. According to a federal website, that act required Medicare-participating hospitals that offer emergency services to provide a medical exam when a request is made for an emergency condition, including active labor, regardless of an individual's ability to pay. Cornyn’s letter also said federal law permitted public health services including immunizations and testing and treatment of symptoms of communicable diseases. Still, he wrote, the 1996 law specified that any other state or local health benefit could be provided only if a state law ""affirmatively provides for such eligibility."" Mike Stafford, the Harris County attorney, reacted to Cornyn’s letter by advising the local hospital district to stop giving discounted preventive care because it violates federal law, according to a July 12, 2001, Associated Press news story. ""It's up to the Texas Legislature to step in now and, if they want to create an exception for this, it's allowable,"" Stafford said.. In 2003, SB 309 died in the House, though advocates including Lunsford said the permission to provide such services ended up in House Bill 2292, a major 2003 overhaul of health care agencies. Section 285.201 of the Texas Health and Safety code ""affirmatively establishes"" the eligibility of undocumented residents to receive non-emergency public health benefits funded locally by public hospital districts. And in the end, did the legislation expand free health care for illegal immigrants? When we inquired, King Hillier, a vice president of the Harris County Hospital District, said by phone that ""basically"" the district had already been providing non-emergency services when the issue reached lawmakers. Hillier stressed the permissive quality of the proposal; funding and delivery of services was left up to local governments. Finally, Hillier noted the Senate version of the law envisioned a system of patients sharing costs, which has resulted, he said. Our ruling Patrick said the Dewhurst-led Senate ""passed an expansion of in-state tuition and free health care to illegal immigrants."" Block that kick. First of all, lawmakers signed off on in-state tuition for undocumented students in 2001--before Dewhurst became lieutenant governor--while the 2005 legislation cited by Patrick largely left the 2001 law intact while focusing on all students getting in-state tuition even if parents move out of state. The proposal regarding free health care for illegal immigrants didn’t launch a program for immigrants, which is what Patrick’s statement seems to suggest. Rather, local governing bodies were permitted to provide (or, it appears, resume providing) non-emergency services to residents regardless of immigration status, an action projected to improve outcomes and head off costly emergency care to which all residents were already entitled per federal law. The Senate proposal also envisioned patients sharing costs. We rate this two-pronged claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Dan Branch registered to lobby for a union, not AFL-CIO
","State Sen. Ken Paxton of McKinney maintains his opponent for the Republican attorney general nomination has lobbied for the biggest labor union organization in America. A news story posted online by the Dallas Morning News on May 11, 2014, quoted Paxton’s campaign spokesman, Anthony Holm, promising attacks based on state Rep. Dan Branch’s legislative actions, including the Dallas lawyer’s supposed advocacy of third-trimester abortions, a charge we earlier found faulty. The story further quoted Holm as saying Branch ""once lobbied on behalf of the AFL-CIO,"" the traditionally Democratic-leaning federation that says it brings together 56 unions representing 12.5 million working men and women. The acronym stands for the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations. By email, Holm responded to our request for backup information by guiding us to a Jan. 23, 2002, lobbying registration filing with the clerk of the U.S House by Winstead Sechrest & Minick, the Dallas-rooted firm (now called Winstead PC) where Branch is a shareholder. In the filing, the firm said it was representing the Paper Allied-Industrial Chemical & Energy (PACE) International Union. The filing lists individuals expected to lobby as Frederick McClure and Branch, identified as shareholders, and Brigham McCown, a firm associate. The filing’s second page lists under ""lobbying issues"" the U.S. Department of Energy ""enhanced facilities."" By phone, Holm said the union represented by the firm later merged with the United Steelworkers, who are affiliated with the AFL-CIO. On April 14, 2005, according to the history page on the steelworkers’ union website, its union merged with the PACE International Union to form the United Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union (USW). ""With more than 850,000 active members in over 8,000 bargaining units in the United States, Canada and the Caribbean, the combined union is the dominant union in paper, forestry products, steel, aluminum, tire and rubber, mining, glass, chemicals, petroleum and other basic resource industries,"" the web page says. Lynne Hancock, a Pittsburgh-based national USW spokesperson, told us by phone that the PACE was affiliated with the AFL-CIO. We asked Branch’s campaign about Branch’s lobbying registration, drawing an email from Branch spokesman Enrique Marquez stating the AFL-CIO hasn’t been a Winstead client. On behalf of the Winstead firm, spokeswoman Shannon Tipton emailed a similar not-so. The emails from Marquez and Tipton each had vague descriptions of the firm's work for the PACE union; Tipton said the law firm engaged in ""transactional work with respect to investments or federal regulatory work before the"" U.S. Department of Energy. Marquez said the firm’s PACE work focused on energy department facilities. In Austin, spokesman Ed Sills of the Texas AFL-CIO responded to our inquiry by saying no one in its office had a memory of Branch’s involvement in a PACE issue. By phone, Sill said it’s inaccurate to say Branch lobbied for the federation if he was registered to lobby solely for an affiliate. ""Say IBM belongs to the chamber of commerce,"" Sills said. ""We don’t say you’re lobbying for the chamber of commerce"" if your client is IBM. After we asked for an interview with Branch, we fielded a phone call from McCown, the third lawyer listed on the Winstead lobbying registration. McCown, saying he’d been contacted by the campaign about our inquiries, told us he connected the firm to an Ohio PACE union local that wanted help in Washington, D.C., where former Texas Gov. George W. Bush was then president, toward preserving a uranium-enrichment facility near Piketon, Ohio, which McCown described as about 40 miles from his boyhood home. Branch played a minimal role on behalf of the union, McCown said, maybe attending a White House meeting. For the union's perspective, we turned back to Hancock, who put us in touch with the former president of the Ohio union local, Daniel Minter of Waverly, Ohio. Minter echoed McCown’s account, adding that the Winstead firm advised the union as it successfully sought federal help creating new missions and jobs on the site of the Ohio plant, where enrichment was ceasing. During the engagement, Minter said, he talked ""very infrequently"" with Branch. Minter said he didn’t recall any AFL-CIO involvement. Our ruling Paxton said Branch once lobbied on behalf of the AFL-CIO, the umbrella group for dozens of unions. Branch registered to lobby in Washington, D.C., in 2002 for a union affiliated with the labor federation that sought federal help preserving jobs near an Ohio facility that was otherwise shutting down. Whatever precise role Branch played for the union, there's no evidence he lobbied for the AFL-CIO. Mark this claim as False. FALSE – The statement is not accurate.

Virginia GOP says Warner voted with Obama 97 percent of the time
","U.S. Sen. Mark Warner isn’t the moderate you thought you elected, Republicans say. ""97 percent of the time. That’s how often Mark Warner votes with President Obama,"" a recent web video by the Republican Party of Virginia said. Warner, a Democrat, is running for a second term this year. Ed Gillespie, a former chairman of the Republican National Party and adviser to President George W. Bush, is expected to win the GOP nomination at a state convention next month. A key strategy for Republican challengers in Virginia and across U.S. this fall will be to tie Democrat incumbents to President Barack Obama, whose national approval ratings have been hovering at around 44 percent. Our colleagues in other PolitiFact bureaus have already examined claims that Democratic Sens. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire and Mark Begich of Alaska are in lockstep with the president. We asked Garren Shipley, spokesman for the state GOP, to back up the claim on Warner’s voting record. He sent us presidential support data compiled by CQ Weekly, a nonpartisan Washington news service that was once known as Congressional Quarterly. The statistics track the percentage of times a member of Congress votes with the stated preference of the president on legislation. Warner, as it turns out, did vote with the president’s wishes 97 of the time both last year and since entering the Senate in 2009. That’s slightly higher than the average for all Democratic senators, who backed Obama when he clearly stated a position 96 percent of the time last year and 95.4 percent of the time since 2009. Here’s Warner’s annual percentage and his ranking in presidential support among all the senators who caucused with the Democrats each year: There’s a few things that should be understood about presidential support statistics. For starters, they deal with only a fraction of the votes Warner has cast. CQ found that Obama staked out a ""clear position"" on only 419 of 1,473 roll call votes in the Senate -- or 28 percent -- since Warner became a member in 2009. Warner voted with the president’s position on 406 of those 419 votes. More than half of them, 226, were to confirm presidential nominations for federal posts. He voted with the president on a number of high profile issues: On key issues, Warner has opposed the president by voting: Warner campaigned for the Senate in 2008 as a ""radical centrist"" who would seek bipartisan compromise. David Turner, Warner’s campaign spokesman this year, was dismissive of the state GOP’s effort to define Warner by his presidential support votes. ""Solely tallying an arbitrary number of procedural votes does not accurately depict the sum total of a U.S. Senator’s work,"" he said. Turner sent us links to other vote studies and news articles that praise Warner for his bipartisan work. For example, National Journal rated Warner the 46th most liberal member of the 100-seat U.S. Senate in 2013, based on an analysis of 117 roll call votes on key economic, foreign and social issues last year. And Open Congress, found that Warner voted with the majority of his party on 90 percent of all Senate bills last year, ranking him 42nd among the 51 Democratic senators. Some of the articles Turner sent concerned Warner’s persistent but unsuccessful efforts to build bipartisan consensus for a debt reduction plan that would cut spending and raise taxes. Turner also noted that some of Warner’s legislative efforts in opposition to Obama’s policies have not advanced to a vote on the Senate floor and, therefore, were not counted in CQ’s presidential support ratings. Warner, for example: We asked two political scientists for their thoughts on presidential support ratings: Larry Sabato of the University of Virginia and Stephen Farnsworth of the University of Mary Washington. They both said the high level of support by Democrats and the low level by Republicans -- who have backed Obama only 46 percent of the time since 2009 -- speaks to the partisanship in the Senate. Both professors said that the rating, which tracks a relatively small number of overall votes, paints an unsophisticated picture of any congressman’s total record, including Warner’s. ""Warner’s Obamacare vote was critical,"" Sabato said. ""But using the 97 percent number really doesn’t tell you much more than he’s a Democrat."" Farnsworth noted that Obama did not take a position on the vast majority of bills that have come before the Senate. ""To imagine that Warner votes like a politburo member for the president would be misleading,"" he said. Our ruling The Republican Party of Virginia says Warner has voted with Obama ""97 percent of the time."" Warner, since entering the Senate in 2009, indeed has taken the same position as the president 97 percent of the time when Obama outlined a clear position, according to Congressional Quarterly. That includes voting for Obamacare. The presidential support rating is by no means a wide measure of performance by Warner or any other member of Congress. The president staked out a position on only 28 percent of the Senate roll call votes since 2009 and more than half of those were to confirm presidential appointments. Senate Democrats, on the whole, have backed the president 95.4 percent of the time during Warner’s term. It should be noted that broad voting studies by the National Journal and Open Congress rate Warner as one of the most conservative Democrats in the Senate. Warner’s presidential support rating, however, is what it is: 97 percent. So we rate the GOP’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DE8EC0>],/factchecks/2014/may/15/republican-party-virginia/virginia-gop-says-warner-voted-obama-97-percent-ti/

John Oliver says 28 percent of people in Kentucky don't have Internet access
","Comedian John Oliver says Kentuckians aren’t getting the Senate campaign they deserve — nor one they can even follow. On his new HBO show Last Week Tonight, Oliver quipped that the race between Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Kentucky’s Democratic Secretary of State Alison Lundergan Grimes has devolved into a battle of silly Internet memes. That’s ironic, The Daily Show alum said, because a good chunk of Kentuckians can’t even get online. ""The people of Kentucky deserve everyone’s sympathy, or at least the one’s with Internet access,"" Oliver said. ""Here’s an interesting fact: 28 percent of Kentuckians don’t have any online access, a commodity the U.N. had deemed a basic human right. Even Alaska has that number down to 18 percent and they had to lay cable through 1,300 miles of narwhal."" We’re sticking to the fact-check about Kentucky’s connected population (but for what it’s worth, narwhals are not indigenous to Alaska.) Defining Internet access We reached out to a producer for Last Week Tonight for the source of the claim. She pointed us to U.S. Census Bureau data from the 2012 current population survey. The survey found that 71.9 percent of Kentuckians reported accessing the Internet either from within their home or outside the home (school, local library, etc.). That ranks 39th in the country. The inverse, then, would mean 28.1 percent in the state don’t have access to the Internet, right? Not exactly. Just because someone doesn’t have Internet, doesn’t mean they don’t have access to it. Typically, Internet ""access"" as a noun is discussed in terms of whether those services would be available if people wanted them. Oliver was measuring it a different way: by the percentage of people who say they actually use the Internet (as in access the verb). Each state collects data every six months on broadband availability to residents in every part of the state and sends it to the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, a part of the Commerce Department. That information is put together to create the National Broadband Map, which shows how connected each community is to the Internet. According to the data, 94.4 percent of people in Kentucky have access to at least Internet speeds of 3 megabits per second (we know that’s not very fast, but we’ll get to that shortly). What Oliver forgets to factor in is some people choose not to connect to the Internet, even though it is available. Why would someone make that choice? According to Census data, about half of people nationwide said they don’t have Internet because they don’t want it or don’t think they need it. Another 28 percent of people said the cost is too prohibitive, while 13 percent said they don’t have a computer at all. So, clearly for some people, access to affordable Internet is as problematic as access to Internet as a whole. But it’s hard to know for how many Kentuckians that was a factor. Need for speed Let’s get back to speed for a second, though, because this is where Oliver’s point is well taken, even if the numbers are off. Internet speed of 3 megabits per second is considered ""basic."" But as University of Kentucky professor Michael Childress notes, ""basic level of broadband speed is no longer sufficient for many important applications,"" such as distance learning. In this realm, Kentuckians are at a disadvantage compared to other states, and the disparity between Kentucky and more connected states increases the faster speeds get. For starters, while getting Internet at speeds 3 mbps to 94 percent of the state seems like an accomplishment, Kentucky actually ranks 47th in the country, ahead of only Montana, Vermont and Alaska. (Side note: Given Oliver’s comments, it’s interesting to see Alaska here. Even though Oliver was right that a higher percentage of Alaskans are hooked up to the Internet at home, a smaller percentage of residents have access to the broadband grid, and that doesn’t change at higher Internet speeds.) Smaller, urban states have an easier time getting their residents access to higher speeds. In New Jersey, for example, 97 percent of the population can access download speeds greater than 50 mbps. Only 58.4 percent of Kentuckians have that luxury. Here’s a chart looking at the percentage of Kentuckians with access to the Internet at varying speeds compared to the rest of the country. Speed % of population with access Rank (50 states) 3 mbps 94.4 47 6 mbps 90.3 46 10 mbps 88.0 47 25 mbps 60.8 43 50 mbps 58.4 42 100 mbps 7.5 44   Kentucky is near the very bottom at every speed. How far behind is Kentucky at the highest speeds? The median state at 100 mbps, Missouri, still has 60 percent of its population in areas with access to Internet speeds at that level. Kentucky has just 7.5 percent. Why such a discrepancy? Childers says it’s about location. ""Some households are located in rural areas where traditional broadband is simply not provided — such as many sparsely populated areas in the mountains of Eastern Kentucky."" The state is working on it, though. Kentucky has received $5.3 million in grants, including from the 2009 federal economic stimulus, to help bring high-speed broadband Internet to all corners of the state. Our ruling Oliver said, ""28 percent of Kentuckians don’t have any online access."" When it comes to Internet speak, ""access"" as a noun refers to whether someone has the ability to acquire Internet. By that definition Oliver is wrong — as only less than 6 percent of Kentucky residents don’t have access to Internet at what’s considered a basic speed. What Oliver would have been better off saying is that 28 percent of Kentucky’s residents don’t access (as a verb) the Internet, which is supported by Census Bureau data. That said, Oliver is largely right in making his broader point — that when it comes to Internet access or use, Kentuckians tend to lag behind the rest of the country. The state ranks near the bottom in both percentage of people who live on a broadband grid and the number of people with Internet in their homes. While this is sad news for the prospects of a PolitiFact Kentucky branch, it helps save Oliver’s less-than-perfectly worded claim. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979EFD40>],/factchecks/2014/may/14/john-oliver/john-oliver-says-28-percent-kentucky-internet/

Chain email overstates tax increases, incorrectly says they all stem from Obamacare
","Numerous readers have asked us to fact-check a chain email they’ve received recently about rising tax rates from Obamacare. Here’s the full text of the email, with its original typos intact: Here is what happened on January 1st 2014: Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6% Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2% Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28% Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6% Estate tax went from 0% to 55% Remember this fact: if you have money, the democrats want it. These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes. These taxes were all passed under the affordable care act, aka Obamacare."" We’ll take these claims in order: ""Here is what happened on January 1st 2014"" To the extent that these tax rates were changed -- and as we’ll see most of them didn’t change in the way the email says -- the changes didn’t take effect on Jan. 1, 2014. They took effect on Jan. 1, 2013. That may seem like a minor difference, but in this case, it makes all the difference. The tax rates that changed on Jan. 1, 2013, were all passed as part of the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012. That was the bipartisan deal -- and we’ll discuss just how bipartisan in a bit -- that passed after the 2012 presidential election to avoid the ""fiscal cliff."" The ""cliff"" refers to the expiration of tax cuts originally passed under President George W. Bush, combined with mandated federal spending cuts. The law made permanent many of the Bush-era tax cuts, but it did raise some taxes that primarily hit upper-income taxpayers. That’s what the email is attempting to spotlight, but it does so in a way that introduces a host of inaccuracies. ""Top Income tax bracket went from 35% to 39.6%"" The timing is wrong, but the numbers are correct. ""Top Income payroll tax went from 37.4% to 52.2%"" Usually people think about income taxes and payroll taxes separately. But it’s not uncommon for tax experts to look at the combination of income and payroll taxes together, because they give a sense of the overall burden of direct taxation on individuals. That’s what the email did here. On Jan. 1, 2013, the top combined rate for the income and payroll tax went from 37.9 percent to 42.5 percent. The top combined rate to 43.4 percent due to an additional Medicare tax in Obamacare. So if you just look at the federal rate, the email overstates the current top rate. If you take state taxes into account, the email is closer, but still inaccurate. The Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that also receives funding from individual donors and foundations, has calculated 2013 combined tax rates for each state. The group found that the top marginal tax rate, averaged across all states, is 47.9 percent. Of course, any state taxes would have been imposed by state governments, and thus were not part of the Affordable Care Act. And this would not be an apples-to-apples comparison; to make the comparison fair, the initial tax rate would need to be adjusted upward for state and local taxes as well. ""Capital Gains tax went from 15% to 28%"" On Jan. 1, 2013, the capital gains tax rate went from 15 percent to 20 percent. The health care law took that up to 23.8 percent. So the email is high by more than 4 percentage points. If you add in state and local taxes, the Tax Foundation says the current rate, averaged across the 50 states, is 28.7 percent, but Tax Foundation economist Kyle Pomerleau said this is ""sort of an apples-to-oranges comparison."" ""Dividends tax went from 15% to 39.6%"" This next line would have been correct if the Bush tax cuts had expired the way they were initially supposed to. But the December 2012 deal ended up going with a top marginal tax rate of 20 percent on dividend income instead of the pre-Bush rate of 39.6 percent on dividend income. It rose to 23.8 percent due to Obamacare. So the final rate cited in the email is far higher than the current rate. ""Estate tax went from 0% to 55%"" Both ends of this claim are wrong. The estate tax was gradually wound down by the Bush-era tax cuts, disappearing entirely in 2010. For 2011 and 2012 it was reimposed at 35 percent, then raised to 40 percent on Jan. 1, 2013 as part of the ""fiscal cliff"" bill. ""These taxes were all passed only with democrat votes, no republicans voted for these taxes. These taxes were all passed under the affordable care act, aka Obamacare."" Most of these changes were passed as part of the 2012 fiscal cliff deal, which was enacted with bipartisan support. Facing expiration of the Bush tax cuts, which would have meant a massive tax increase up and down the income scale, both parties felt compelled to strike a deal that neither side was really enthusiastic about. In the Senate, the measure passed by an 89-8 margin. Forty Republicans voted for it, and just five Republicans voted against it. In the House, it passed by a 257-167 margin. While a majority of Republicans (151) voted against the bill, 85 Republicans did vote for it. So the email is flatly wrong to say that no Republicans voted for these taxes. It’s also incorrect to say that these taxes were all raised by Obamacare. The health care law did add marginally to three of the five taxes -- 0.9 percentage points extra on the top payroll tax rate, and 3.8 percentage points higher for the capital gains and the dividends tax -- but the bulk of the increases came from the fiscal cliff deal. All told, less than a third of the actual increases in the taxes cited by the email came from Obamacare. Our ruling The chain email said that ""no Republicans voted for"" recent hikes in the income tax, payroll tax, capital gains tax, dividend tax and estate tax, arguing that they ""were all passed under … Obamacare."" The email gets many things wrong, including the effective date of the increases and most of the rates, which are uniformly higher than the actual rates. Most obviously, the email is flat-out wrong when it blames Democrats, and Obamacare, exclusively for the increases. The bulk of the tax hikes stem from a different bill entirely -- the fiscal cliff bill, which received support from a large majority of Senate Republicans and a significant minority of House Republicans. This email is so riddled with errors -- and gets so few things correct -- that we rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B30900>],/factchecks/2014/may/14/chain-email/chain-email-overstates-tax-increases-incorrectly-s/
"['Immigration', 'Criminal Justice', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'Julián Castro']","
Dan Patrick proposed Arizona-style law requiring police to inquire into legal status of individuals suspected of being unauthorized U.S. residents
","In an April 15, 2014, debate on immigration, Democrat Julián Castro said Republican Dan Patrick filed legislation akin to the 2010 Arizona mandate that police officers ask individuals about their immigration status. ""He filed (Senate Bill) 1070-like show-me-your-papers legislation,"" the San Antonio mayor said in the debate aired by the Univision network. Castro said this action left Patrick out of step with Texas Democrats and Republicans who, he suggested, are more supportive of immigrants regardless of origin. Patrick, the Houston state senator in a May 27 runoff with incumbent David Dewhurst for the GOP lieutenant governor nomination, replied: ""No, mayor. That’s a lie."" Asked to elaborate, Patrick said: ""First of all, that bill, which didn’t pass, would have only … come into play had police had suspicions that someone had committed a crime and then"" they would ""turn it over to"" the federal Immigration Customs Enforcement agency, he said, ""to try to keep us in line with Secure Communities,"" the program enabling fingerprints of arrested individuals to be checked against federal crime and immigration databases. Patrick further said he’d decided, ""based on things the federal government has done, that that bill will not pass and will not be effective."" We wondered if indeed Patrick filed an Arizona-type ""show-me-your-papers"" proposal. Looks like it. Castro's basis By email, Castro spokesman Jaime Castillo quoted Patrick’s measure, which died without a hearing in the 2011 legislative session, and said it was similar to a vital part of Arizona’s law. As recapped by Castillo, Patrick’s legislation specified: ""A peace officer shall inquire into the lawful presence of any person who is lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested on other grounds if the officer has a reasonable suspicion to believe the person has violated a criminal provision of the federal immigration laws (sic)."" Castillo said Arizona's law ""included language authorizing police officers to check immigration status if they have reasonable suspicion to believe that someone is here illegally and, before"" court rulings  ""to arrest without a warrant, anyone ‘the officer has probable cause to believe … has committed any public offense that makes the person removable from the United States.’"" Let’s look at both. Arizona law Arizona’s 21-page measure, signed into law in April 2010, included provisions intended to ""work together to discourage and deter the unlawful entry and presence of aliens and economic activity by persons unlawfully present"" in the country. A key element of the law--which included state-level restrictions on human smuggling and workers congregating in search of day jobs--directed law officers at all levels to check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Another section said the immigration status of arrested individuals must be checked before their release. The law also provided for officers to transport individuals lacking proof of legal residency to federal authorities. Generally, as noted in a 2010 fact check, the law required legal immigrants to carry papers that confirmed their legal status, though the U.S. Supreme Court later threw out parts of the law that would have made state crimes out of federal immigration violations, as reported by The Associated Press in June 2012. According to the AP’s account, the court rejected the law’s mandate that immigrants obtain or carry immigration registration papers. It also tossed language making it a state criminal offense for an illegal immigrant to seek work or hold a job, the AP said, and voided a provision permitting police to arrest suspected illegal immigrants without warrants. The court let stand the law’s requirement that police officers check the status of people stopped for various reasons who might appear to be in the U.S. illegally. Even then, the AP reported, the justices said the provision could be subject to additional legal challenges. Also, they removed some teeth by prohibiting officers from arresting people on immigration charges. Patrick’s proposal According to a Texas legislative website, Patrick filed his measure, SB 126, on Nov. 8, 2010 in anticipation of the 2011 legislative session. The proposal called for revising the state’s Code of Criminal Procedure by specifying that a ""peace officer shall inquire into the lawful presence of any person who is lawfully stopped, detained, or arrested on other grounds if the officer has a reasonable suspicion to believe the person has violated a criminal provision of the federal immigration laws."" If the officer has ""probable cause"" to believe as much, the officer could arrest the person and ""shall identify and report the person to"" ICE, the proposal said. Also, Patrick’s measure voided any local ordinance, regulation or policy interfering with an officer carrying out the described duty, furthermore giving legal immunity to an officer, agency or other governmental entity for any cause of action connected to carrying out such duties aside from intentional misconduct, recklessness or gross negligence connected with the intended law. At the time, news stories said Patrick had filed a proposal like the show-your-papers part of the Arizona law, though Patrick stressed in interviews that police officers would be required to ask a person if they were in the state legally only if they reasonably suspected otherwise. A Nov. 13, 2010, news story in the San Antonio Express-News quoted him as saying law agencies wanted the question to be required, instead of being optional, to avoid complaints of profiling. In January 2011, Patrick separately told the Associated Press and an MSNBC host that he’d been to Arizona to see its law in action. Patrick said on MSNBC: ""It's workable for our police. And then once a police officer says to someone, are you legally present, because they don't have any identification, we then give the discretion to the officer to take the next step. Is that an arrest, is it detaining that person on suspicion of another possible crime?"" Logan Spence, Patrick’s lieutenant governor campaign manager, replied to our query about Patrick’s proposal with an email suggesting Patrick’s proposal was more narrow than the entire Arizona statute. By phone, Castillo said Castro didn’t say in the debate that Patrick filed the entire Arizona law. Our ruling Castro said Patrick ""proposed Arizona-style show-me-your-papers legislation."" Patrick’s unsuccessful proposal was similar to, and modeled on, Arizona’s show-your-papers provision. We rate this claim as True.

Rove: Clinton hospital stay and glasses point to traumatic brain injury
","If Hillary Clinton decides to run for president, she knows every bit of her life will be put under a microscope. Republican strategist and Fox News commentator Karl Rove proved the point at an event near Los Angeles last Thursday. In remarks reported in the New York Post, Rove raised questions about Clinton’s health following a mild concussion in 2012. ""Thirty days in the hospital,"" Rove said. ""And when she reappears, she's wearing glasses that are only for people who have traumatic brain injury? We need to know what's up with that."" Many people took Rove’s comments to mean that he thinks Clinton has a brain injury, though Rove says he was just raising the question and that it should be part of any presidential vetting. There are two points for us to cover in this fact check -- the time Clinton spent in the hospital and the nature of the glasses she wore for weeks afterward. (She doesn’t wear them now.) First, the background. In December 2012, a stomach virus kept Clinton at home where she fainted and hit her head. During a follow-up visit, doctors spotted a blood clot, admitted her to the hospital and treated her with blood thinners. Clinton was in the hospital for about four days, not 30, a point Rove got wrong. (In a subsequent interview, Rove said it was a ""30-day period where she’s fighting something."") Clinton testified near the end of January at a House hearing on the Benghazi, Libya, attack, and was seen wearing the glasses Rove referred to. A State Department spokesman said they were related to issues stemming from her concussion. The peculiar shape of one of the lenses led experts and doctors to conclude they were prismatic glasses. The glasses are designed to help with blurred or double vision, experts told us. We spoke with Steven Galetta, who is chair of the Neurology Department at New York University Medical Center. ""About 30 to 50 percent of concussions lead to some kind of visual problem,"" Galetta said. ""When there’s double vision, we can manage it by putting a prism over one eye. It bends the light to line up the image from the other eye."" Galetta said the glasses are often optional. Whether someone wears them depends on how quickly the person wants to get back to work. ""Most patients resolve (the issues) on their own,"" he said. ""I’d say 85 to 90 percent of these patients do incredibly well and have no recognizable symptoms afterwards."" Given Clinton’s job as Secretary of State, Galetta said he could see why her doctors might have jumped in to deal with her complaint. Rove exagerated the tie between the glasses and trauma. Galetta said such lenses are used in cases other than traumatic brain injury. Anything that affects the ocular motor nerves or the way the eyes work together can produce double vision that then might be treated with prismatic glasses. So while Rove said the glasses are used ""only"" for people with traumatic brain injury, doctors say that is incorrect. More broadly, Rove’s characterization of Clinton’s concussion as a traumatic brain injury generated a bit of concern among the physicians we reached. Doug Smith is a professor of neurosurgery and director of the Center for Brain Injury and Repair at the University of Pennsylvania. Smith said the public might not understand how broadly the term applies. The Centers for Disease Control report that 2.2 million head injuries sent people to the emergency room in 2010. ""Technically, a concussion is a mild traumatic brain injury,"" Smith said. ""But Rove made a linkage that doesn’t fit. Having a concussion and wearing those glasses tell you nothing about a person’s cognitive status. The vast majority of people with concussions make a full recovery."" Our ruling Rove said Clinton spent 30 days in the hospital and then emerged wearing glasses that only people with traumatic brain injury use. Rove since said he was wrong about the length of her hospital stay. The actual number is four days. By describing a long hospital stay and tying it to signs of traumatic brain injury, Rove associated Clinton with a more profound medical episode. Experts reject that association. Concussions are the mildest form of traumatic brain injury. The glasses Clinton wore are an optional treatment for temporary problems of double vision that are relatively common among people who suffer concussions along with other conditions. She has not worn the glasses for some time, and the neurologists we contacted said most people recover fully. While Rove never claimed Clinton suffered brain damage, he was wrong about the hospital stay and combined that with the glasses to exaggerate the nature of Clinton’s injury. His claim is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C57240>],/factchecks/2014/may/14/karl-rove/rove-clinton-hospital-stay-and-glasses-point-traum/
"['Economy', 'Labor', 'New York', 'Bill de Blasio']","
Who led the way for a $15 minimum wage in New York?
","New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio says lawmakers in Albany followed the lead of city government when they passed a statewide minimum wage increase last year. De Blasio, who is up for reelection this year, made the claim in his 2017 State of the City address. ""We all together -- so many partners in this room did again what was said to be impossible,"" de Blasio said. ""We raised the minimum wage to $15 first in city government. Now, working together with people in Albany, it's the law of the state."" De Blasio raised the minimum wage for city employees in January 2016, about three months before the New York State Legislature passed a new statewide minimum wage in April. The minimum wage will be phased in to $15 at different rates across the state over the next several years. So is de Blasio right about New York City paving the way for the wage increase? The fast food wage board Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo took the first statewide action on a $15 minimum wage in May 2015 when he convened his fast-food wage board. The governor cannot unilaterally raise the statewide minimum wage, but the Department of Labor has the authority to raise wages for a specific industry. The fast-food wage board was charged with recommending a pay increase for workers in that industry. After four public hearings, the wage board recommended a phased-in minimum wage of $15 for fast-food workers. Acting State Labor Commissioner Mario J. Musolino approved the recommendation in September 2015. State and SUNY workers Cuomo, two months later in November 2015, announced a minimum wage increase to $15 for state workers. The order applied to 10,000 New York state employees. Cuomo announced the same increase for employees of the State University of New York in January 2016. The increase applied to 28,000 SUNY employees. Both actions were scheduled to be fully phased in by 2018 in New York City and 2021 statewide. New York City De Blasio announced a $15 minimum wage for city workers on Jan. 6, 2016 -- two days after Cuomo announced the wage increase for SUNY workers. De Blasio’s announcement applied to more public workers than Cuomo’s two major announcements combined. He said 50,000 workers would see a raise in the city, compared with Cuomo’s combined 38,000 employees between the state and SUNY workers. De Blasio’s raise will be fully phased in by the end of 2018, like state and SUNY workers in New York City. Other cities Syracuse Mayor Stephanie Miner was the first elected official in New York state to raise the minimum wage to $15 for public employees. Miner made the announcement in October 2015, about three weeks before Cuomo announced the raise for state workers and three months before de Blasio. The action only affected 61 city employees in Syracuse, but the raise took effect immediately. The cities of Buffalo and Rochester announced their own minimum wage increases to $15 about a month later in November. Both cities were scheduled to phase in the wage increase by 2021. The action affected 479 city workers in Buffalo and 116 in Rochester. Our ruling De Blasio said during his State of the City address that ""we raised the minimum wage to $15 first in city government. Now, working together with people in Albany, it's the law of the state."" De Blasio trailed the pack on this issue. Three other cities in New York state gave their public employees a raise before New York City. An increase for state and SUNY workers also came before his action. Fast-food workers were the first to get a raise. He did raise the New York City wage before the State Legislature enacted a statewide wage increase. While that part of his statement is accurate, his claim leaves out important details and ignores other facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967FA400>],/factchecks/2017/mar/08/bill-de-blasio/who-led-way-15-minimum-wage-new-york/
"['National', 'Children', 'Taxes', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Nancy Pelosi says Donald Trump's child-care proposal mainly benefits high earners
","House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said she cannot jump on board with President Donald Trump’s child care proposals because they won’t actually help the poorest Americans. On CNN’s State of the Union, moderator Jake Tapper said, ""In a speech to a joint session of Congress, President Trump renewed his commitment to child care and paid family leave ... Paid family leave, a big Democratic priority for a long time, is that something you could work with the president on?"" Pelosi said, ""The first conversation I had with him after the election, that week of the election, we talked about that subject, and a subject that his family is interested in as well. But what he has proposed is something that benefits -- 70 percent of the benefits go to people making over $100,000 a year."" We decided to check out Pelosi’s claim. It’s important to note she is not referring to the estimated benefits of paid family leave, but the monetary benefits of Trump’s child care tax proposals. Trump has made no formal attempts to advance his paid family leave policy yet, although both Democratic and Republican senators introduced two different bills on this general issue. So all we have is an analysis of his proposal from the campaign. Trump’s proposal includes six weeks of paid maternity leave if no policy is offered by an employer; tax deductions for child care expenses up to age 13, capped at the average cost of childcare per state; a refundable tax credit for child care costs for lower-income families; and expanding tax-free savings accounts for childcare and school tuition. The Tax Policy Center, run by the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, released its study of Trump’s child care plan Feb. 28, a few days before Pelosi’s interview. Pelosi’s spokesman confirmed she was citing this report on during her CNN interview. The Tax Policy Center study found that 70 percent of total tax benefits would go to families earning more than $100,000. The reason? Trump’s plan relies on tax deductions, which are worth more per dollar for higher income families. That’s because families with higher incomes face higher marginal tax rates. Lower-income families may spend less on child care because they often rely on informal, low-cost arrangements. Chye-Ching Huang, one of the study’s co-authors and deputy director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said in an email, ""The estimate that 70  percent of the benefits go to those with incomes over $100,000 is conservative -- the share going to those with incomes over $100,000 could very well be higher."" Analysts looked at three new tax benefits related to child care proposed by his campaign: the deduction for child care expenses, a refundable credit aimed at low-income families without stay-at-home parents, and the expansion of tax-free savings accounts. According to their report, Trump’s plan would increase the average after-tax income for families by about $190 in 2017. Those with an income below $40,000 per year might see an increase of $20 or less. Families making between $100,000-$200,000 per year might see an average jump of $360.   Further, they say Trump’s proposed tax credit for lower-income families is worth less than the deduction. Taxpayers who claim the credit would benefit by up to 7.7 cents per dollar spent on child care. Those claiming the deduction may receive between 10 and 39.6 cents per dollar spent on child care. Lower income families are also less likely to place money into Trump’s proposed savings accounts due to lower levels of financial liquidity. In sum, then, the report finds that Trump’s current family leave policy is regressive, helping families in higher income brackets more than those in lower-income ones. Alan Cole, an economist from the Tax Foundation, said that he agreed with the distribution tables from the Tax Policy Center’s report. ""The only caveat I'd add is that campaign proposals like this one tend to be refined and revamped after people take office,"" he said. ""I could easily see the next version of the policy having a different distributional impact."" The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Our ruling Pelosi said that Trump’s plan for child care would mean that ""70 percent of the benefits go to the people making $100,000 a year."" The one comprehensive study released so far by an independent group supports Pelosi’s claim. It’s possible that different studies -- or a substantive change to the Trump administration proposal as it works its way toward enactment -- could weaken the certainty of Pelosi’s analysis. Based on what we know now, though, we rate her statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C6B900>],/factchecks/2017/mar/08/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-donald-trumps-child-care-proposa/

Most U.S. foreign aid flows through U.S. organizations
","President Donald Trump’s budget director Mike Mulvaney confirmed recently that foreign aid is on the chopping block. In an interview before the president’s address to Congress, Mulvaney said Trump would help pay for an increase in defense spending with ""fairly dramatic reductions in foreign aid."" Critics of programs that aim to boost economies, increase education and otherwise give poorer nations a leg up often say such aid is wasted through corruption and poor design. While Trump himself indicated during the campaign that some aid was warranted, in 2013 he tweeted, ""Every penny of the $7 billion going to Africa as per Obama will be stolen - corruption is rampant!"" The former head of the U.S. Agency for International Development Raj Shah wrote recently that such concerns about fraud and theft are way behind the times. ""Aid and development practitioners know how to set smart targets, engage private-sector partners, adapt to changing circumstances and make sure taxpayers get the most value for their investments,"" Shah wrote in a Feb. 24 Washington Post op-ed. ""Most U.S. foreign assistance no longer even goes to foreign governments. It is given to U.S. companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants; these organizations then implement projects in other countries, employing a combination of American and foreign staff members and often partnering with institutions of civil society."" We wondered if, in fact, most American aid goes to private companies and nonprofits, which then run programs in foreign countries. According to the Congressional Research Service, Shah is correct by a whopping margin. The nonpartisan research arm of Congress reported in 2015 that only 4 percent of USAID assistance goes directly to foreign governments. ""Most USAID funds go through U.S. partners — universities, NGOs, and contractors — although their efforts may directly assist a government’s ministries of education or health, for example, in providing educational and health programs to their public,"" the report said. The report said that, collectively, 49 percent of aid flows through American nonprofits, for-profit companies and American educational institutions. Another 29 percent goes to international organizations such as the Global Fund and various United Nations agencies. The domestic share is likely even higher. Shah is a fellow at the aid advocacy group Results for America. Staff there cited a specialty trade publication article that found that in 2015, the top 20 recipients of USAID funding were American organizations and ""these transactions account for 70 percent of the total USAID spending for obligated contracts for the year."" Not all assistance flows through USAID, but it accounts for over 60 percent of the total. This pattern began to take shape in the mid 1970s as Washington shifted from financing large infrastructure projects to programs more directly aimed at helping the poor. Technical assistance replaced bricks and mortar. There has been a growing emphasis on health, most significantly the President’s Emergency Program for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR). According to a 2013 report on all PEPFAR funding streams, as of 2008, 22 of the top 25 contractors were based in the United States. In 2016, the United States spent about $3.4 billion on health-related programs and about $2.9 billion on humanitarian assistance, according to the government’s website on foreign aid. Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Washington-based Center for Global Development, told us the general pattern of working through the private sector holds across all of the agencies that oversee the aid budget, including the State and Agriculture Departments. ""The checks and controls in the procurement system are quite sound,"" Morris said. ""There is this culture of measurement and transparency that is more common today. Our foreign assistance programs are much more steeped in trying to measure what are we getting for our money. We’ve gone beyond protecting against corruption."" Our ruling Former USAID administrator Shah said that most U.S. foreign assistance goes to private companies and nonprofits in the form of contracts and grants. According to the Congressional Budget Office, USAID, the government’s largest agency for non-military aid, spends about 4 percent of its funds on direct aid to foreign governments. A trade publication reported that 70 percent of the agency’s money ran through U.S.-based organizations. The use of contracts and grants has grown over the past three decades. An independent aid analyst said the general pattern at USAID applies across the other government offices that oversee foreign assistance.

Did Russian officials go in back door of Trump Tower to meet Donald Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner?
","U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan says questions about possible ties between President Donald Trump and Russia must be answered before Congress can take up issues such as the Affordable Care Act and tax reform. Making his points in a March 3, 2017, Wisconsin Public Television interview, the Madison-area Democrat also made a Russia-related claim about Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and a senior adviser in his administration, that we want to check. The claim came during this exchange between Pocan and Frederica Freyberg, host of the talk show ""Here and Now:"" Pocan: When a country like Russia comes in and interferes with our elections, that should bother everybody. And I give people like John McCain and others credit, because they’re saying that. But the fact that Donald Trump acts like nothing happened, makes me even more suspicious of how much he knows and when he knew about it. Freyberg: What about other people across the aisle, your peers, are they taking this as seriously as you are? Pocan: More and more are, as more of this information comes out. So, I think at first, they also were told, Oh, there’s nothing here to look at, nothing here to look at. But now you find out the son-in-law of the president met with Russian officials at the Trump Tower after having them come in the back door. Did Kushner meet with Russian officials at Trump Tower who came in the back door? The evidence Pocan’s office pointed us to a New York Times news article published the day before Pocan’s interview. It reported that the White House said Kushner had taken part in a meeting with one Russian official. According to the Times: In December 2016, Michael Flynn, who at the time was Trump’s incoming national security adviser, and Kushner met at Trump Tower with the Russian ambassador, Sergey Kislyak. The purpose was to establish a line of communication between the new administration and the Russian government. Flynn appears to have been ""the main interlocutor with the Russian envoy — the two were in contact during the campaign and the transition, Kislyak and current and former American officials have said."" ""They generally discussed the relationship and it made sense to establish a line of communication,"" said White House spokeswoman Hope Hicks. ""Jared has had meetings with many other foreign countries and representatives — as many as two dozen other foreign countries’ leaders and representatives."" ""It is common and not improper for transition officials to meet with foreign officials,"" the Times article said. ""But all meetings between Trump associates and Russians are now significant as the FBI investigates Russian interference in the American election and whether anyone close to Trump’s campaign was involved."" Kushner’s attendance at the meeting was first reported by the New Yorker magazine. The White House also confirmed the meeting to other news media. Pocan’s office also cited a news article in The Telegraph, a British newspaper, that said the Russian diplomat ""reportedly"" entered Trump Tower for the meeting by a back entrance. We found a few claims and assumptions that the ambassador entered the building by a rear entrance, but no definitive reports that that was the case.

HB2 has cost North Carolina hundreds of millions of dollars. Dan Forest says that isn't very much
","The boycotts of North Carolina by businesses, musicians, sports leagues and others have led to national headlines and outrage from opponents of the law that spurred the backlash. House Bill 2, or HB2 as it’s more commonly known, has been creating economic backlash against North Carolina for nearly a year now. The controversial law was the first (and so far, only) in the nation to say that transgender people can’t use the bathrooms or locker rooms of the gender with which they identify in government facilities like schools or parks. It also continued North Carolina’s policy of not giving people protection from anti-LGBT discrimination and banned any city or county from extending local nondiscrimination rules. It also banned local governments from enacting rules related to issues like the minimum wage or paid family leave. North Carolina Lt. Gov. Dan Forest spoke in Texas at a press conference Monday in support of a bill similar to HB2 that’s under consideration there. Forest said the backlash is worth it to protect people’s privacy and safety in bathrooms. And, he said, the backlash hasn’t even been that big in the grand scheme of things: That despite the steady stream of boycotts and cancellations, North Carolina’s economy has barely been harmed by HB2. ""If you look at the most extreme instances of economic impact, by the media and by the universities and the people who come out and say ‘This is the impact,’ that most extreme impact equates to one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual GDP,"" Forest said. We have seen instances of politicians trying to deflect or whitewash the effects of HB2 – we gave former Gov. Pat McCrory a Pants On Fire ruling for a ludicrous claim he made about a high-profile Bruce Springsteen concert cancellation – so we wanted to look into this most recent claim by Forest. NC by the numbers It could be that Forest has been reading some of our previous coverage of HB2. His claim is exactly what we reported in October, in a fact-check of McCrory’s top economic official. At that time, former Commerce Secretary John Skvarla had said that HB2 hadn’t had ""one iota"" of a negative effect on North Carolina’s economy. We ruled that claim Mostly False. Our research, plus interviews with economists and analysis of other studies, has shown HB2 probably cost the state between $450 million and $630 million. Others have cited a $500 million loss. The law has also cost North Carolina a minimum of 1,400 jobs. ""North Carolina’s GDP is around $510 billion,"" we wrote at the time. ""So even a $500 million loss would only represent 0.1 percent of that."" That’s exactly what Forest said Monday. (For the mathematically-challenged out there, 0.1 percent is the same thing as one-tenth of 1 percent.) GDP means gross domestic product. When states are concerned it’s sometimes called GSP for gross state product. It counts a combination of consumer spending, government spending and other measures of economic output. In recent months, there haven’t been many major new boycotts or cancellations – or at least, none that have been publicly verified. The NCAA could soon pull years’ worth of championship events out of North Carolina, costing the state millions more, but that hasn’t happened yet. And even if there have been hundreds of millions more in losses that we don’t know about yet, that still wouldn’t change the truth of Forest’s claim. Whether North Carolina has lost $500 million, $600 million or even $1 billion, that’s still just a small fraction of the state’s overall economy. For that same reason that Skvarla’s argument didn’t really hold up, Forest’s is accurate: North Carolina’s economy has indeed been harmed by HB2. But the economy as a whole is large enough that it would take some serious losses to add up to even a 1 percent loss. North Carolina has the country’s ninth-largest population and 10th-largest economy. The state’s GDP was the nation’s fastest-growing several years ago, we found in a fact-check of a True claim McCrory made last year. But it was slowing down by the end of McCrory’s time in office, and in 2015 North Carolina’s GDP growth was below the national average, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Other economic factors at play Forest made a number of other economic claims about North Carolina’s job growth, unemployment rate and budget surpluses. Some were more accurate than others. For a more detailed explanation, see this roundup of other claims Forest made Monday. Forest also cited several magazines or other groups that have rated North Carolina a good place to do business, even despite the headlines and headaches HB2 has created. He’s right about that, too. As we noted last year: ""And even after HB2 passed and the backlash became apparent, CNBC rated North Carolina the fifth-best state for business. And the trade publication Site Selection Magazine ranked North Carolina and Texas as tied for the title of ""most competitive state."" Our ruling Forest said HB2’s economic harm to North Carolina has amounted to only ""one-tenth of 1 percent of our annual GDP."" He’s right. While $500 million in economic losses (not to mention at least 1,400 jobs lost) is not insignificant, the state’s overall economy is large enough that the losses are only about 0.1 percent of the total GDP. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C20C180>],/factchecks/2017/mar/07/dan-forest/hb2-has-cost-north-carolina-hundreds-millions-doll/

Florida teacher pay lags national average, just not quite by $10,000
","If Republican leaders want to attract good-paying jobs to Florida, House Democratic Leader Janet Cruz says that they should start with well-funded public schools. Cruz said Florida should invest in public school teachers in her response to Republican Gov. Rick Scott’s annual speech opening the Legislature’s two-month session. ""The right thing is to just give teachers a raise,"" said Cruz, who represents Tampa. ""It is embarrassing and I am ashamed that Florida pays our teachers $10,000 a year less than the national average. We are one of the largest states in the country. If we continue to recruit and retain the most talented people to educate our children, it starts with paying them a wage that they can live on without working a second job."" Cruz certainly has a point. On the specifics, teacher pay in Florida lags behind the national average by about $9,000. Teacher pay A spokesman for Cruz said she rounded up a figure from the U.S. News and World Report Best Jobs of 2017 rankings. The report showed the median salary for a U.S. high school teacher was $57,200 in 2015. Florida Department of Education data show the average salary for a teacher in Florida was $48,179 as of April 2016. That difference: about $9,021. We went in search of other rankings comparing public school teacher pay nationwide. The National Educational Association, a labor union, collects data from state education departments showing average classroom teacher pay in each state. The most recent numbers from fall 2016 show Florida teacher salary at $49,199 and the national average at $58,353 -- or a difference of about $9,154. (An analysis by the NEA earlier in the year showed a slightly different national average but the NEA allows states to provide updated data later in the year.) Florida has paid teachers less than the national average for many years pre-dating Scott’s tenure. A chart from the federal National Center for Education Statistics based on NEA data shows a similar pay gap between Florida and the national average in 2009-10 when Charlie Crist was governor. The most recent year that shows Florida teacher pay was anywhere close to the national average was in 1969-70. From previous fact-checks, we’ve learned comparing teacher pay nationwide is no simple task. Within a state, the pay and cost of living can vary among school districts depending on if they are small rural towns, urban centers or wealthy beachfront communities. Discrepancies in benefits, such as health insurance, can make a difference in take-home pay. Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters said that each school district negotiates salaries of their instructional and classroom staff locally. Additionally, Florida has no state income tax, she said (although income tax is only one piece of what people pay in taxes). Our ruling Cruz said, ""Florida pays our teachers $10,000 a year less than the national average."" The real difference between the average national and Florida pay for teachers is technically closer to $9,000 than $10,000. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1F2080>],/factchecks/2017/mar/07/janet-cruz/how-much-does-florida-teacher-pay-lag-behind-natio/

Social media post on pending GOP bills is largely accurate
","If you inhabit the more liberal corners of social media, you may have seen a list of 10 Republican bills in your feed -- a reminder of the substantive changes that could result from unified GOP control of Washington. Here’s the text of a common version that’s circulating: OK - It's important to pay attention to the Russian spy drama, but let's not ignore the fact that the following bills HAVE been introduced: 1. HR 861 Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency 2. HR 610 Vouchers for Public Education 3. HR 899 Terminate the Department of Education 4. HJR 69 Repeal Rule Protecting Wildlife 5. HR 370 Repeal Affordable Care Act 6. HR 354 Defund Planned Parenthood 7. HR 785 National Right to Work (this one ends unions) 8. HR 83 Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Bill 9. HR 147 Criminalizing Abortion (""Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act"") 10. HR 808 Sanctions against Iran Please copy/paste and share widely. Call your House Representative and ask them to not only vote ""NO""...but to speak up for our rights, health & safety, and our beautiful country. How accurate is the post? All 10 bills cited do exist, and most (though not all) have been accurately described. But a majority of the bills mentioned haven’t advanced very far or attracted more than a few co-sponsors, so many are relative longshots for actually becoming law. How accurate are the descriptions? Most of the bills listed are described by their official title, or by a truncated version of the official title. So those strike us as being accurate. But for a few bills, the description is overly broad or misleading. One of those -- H.J.R. 69 -- is described as ""Repeal Rule Protecting Wildlife."" That’s on the right track, but whoever reads this wouldn’t know that it’s specific to certain types of federal land in Alaska. The measure is an effort to overturn a federal rule using the Congressional Review Act, which allows Congress to repeal executive branch regulations under certain circumstances. The measure in question would overrule an Obama administration rule governing non-subsistence taking of wildlife on National Wildlife Refuge land in Alaska. As it happens, this is the only one of the 10 measures that has passed the House already. It passed by a mostly party-line, 225-193 margin on Feb. 16, 2017. It is now awaiting action in the Senate. Another bill with a somewhat exaggerated description is H.R. 785, which is listed as ""National Right to Work (this one ends unions)."" Right-to-work laws say workers can’t be forced to join a union. They do this by making it harder to form a union, and it’s true that on average, states that have right-to-work laws have significantly lower unionization rates than states that don’t. But it’s an exaggeration to say that it ""ends"" unions. In fact six of the states that have right to work laws have between 10 and 16 percent of their workforces unionized -- Indiana, Iowa, Kentucky, Michigan, Nevada, and West Virginia. And the remainder of right-to-work states do have unions -- they’re just less common than in the states that don’t have a right-to-work law. The third and last of the exaggerated descriptions refers to H.R. 147, which is listed as ""Criminalizing Abortion (‘Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act’)."" This bill would criminalize one particular kind of abortion -- one sought ""based on the sex, gender, color or race of the child, or the race of a parent."" That’s not to say it’s not controversial -- it is. Referring to last year’s version of the bill, then-Rep. Loretta Sanchez, D-Calif., called the measure ""an affront to all minority women, especially Latinas and immigrant women, who already face disproportionate barriers to access health care and health education."" But contrary to the most obvious reading of the social media post, this bill would not criminalize abortion across the board. How much support do these bills have? A few are likely to go far. For the rest, probably not. Let’s start with the bills where eventual passage seems quite plausible. As we noted, the Alaska wildlife measure has already passed the House and must now be taken up by the Senate. Two other bills listed are unlikely to move in the version listed, but the ideas contained within them are likely to be taken up by the GOP leadership on a high-priority basis. One is H.R. 370, which would repeal the Affordable Care Act. H.R. 370 itself doesn’t have a single co-sponsor, but repealing Obama’s health care law is a high priority for House Republicans. An actual repeal-and-replace bill was released on March 6, and that is the likelier vehicle to be considered by the chamber. The other measure that’s likely to advance, but not in the version listed in the post, is H.R. 354, which would stop federal funding for abortion providers such as Planned Parenthood. Federal funding for abortions is already banned, but opponents of abortion say that federal funding should be stopped for non-abortion services provided by clinics that offer abortions. The draft of the Obamacare repeal bill unveiled on March 6 would stop funding for such organizations. Of the other seven bills, none has advanced beyond introduction, and all but one have a minimal number of co-sponsors, all of them Republicans. Here’s the rundown, as of March 7, 2017: • H.R. 861 -- ""Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency"" -- one sponsor, three co-sponsors. • H.R. 610 -- ""Vouchers for Public Education"" -- one sponsor, three co-sponsors. • H.R. 899 -- ""Terminate the Department of Education"" -- one sponsor, eight co-sponsors. • H.R. 785 -- ""National Right to Work (this one ends unions) -- one sponsor, 15 co-sponsors. • H.R. 83 -- ""Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Bill"" -- one sponsor, nine co-sponsors. • H.R. 147 -- ""Criminalizing Abortion (‘Prenatal Nondiscrimination Act’)"" -- one sponsor, 59 co-sponsors. • H.R. 808 -- ""Sanctions against Iran"" -- one sponsor, four co-sponsors. So just one of these bills have attracted co-sponsorship of more than 15 out of the 435 House members. The one that did, on prenatal sex selection, has been introduced for several congresses running and has only moved beyond introduction once. That was in 2012, when the House leadership put it up under so-called suspension of the rules. That means that a bill is fast-tracked to a vote, but to pass, it needs to win two-thirds support. The bill failed to meet the two-thirds threshold; on a mostly party-line vote, it secured 246 votes in favor and 168 votes against. For the rest, it’s conceivable that these can pass, especially in an environment -- as we have now -- with unified Republican control. Many of these bills address issues that President Donald Trump has advocated. That said, the House has only a limited amount of time, and co-sponsorship and committee consideration are key indications of what ranks high on the leadership’s agenda. On these metrics, the remaining seven bills fall short of being considered top-tier priorities. Rather, these bills may have more of an impact in keeping the GOP base happy. John Feehery, a former aide to then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, said most of the bills on the list seem ""like click-bait for fundraising to me. I find it it hard (to believe) that they go anywhere."" Feehery is now president of the bipartisan lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie Associates. Our ruling The social media post listed 10 bills that it said have been introduced in the House by Republicans. All 10 bills in the post have in fact been introduced. Seven were described accurately, while three had somewhat exaggerated descriptions. Meanwhile, one of the 10 bills has passed, and two seem to be on a fast track, while the other seven are more accurately considered longshots. So the post is largely correct, but it includes some exaggerated language, and it fails to distinguish between top-tier agenda items and priorities further back in the pack. We rate it Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C243400>],/factchecks/2017/mar/07/social-media/social-media-post-pending-gop-bills-largely-accura/

Donald Trump wrongly blames Barack Obama for former Guantanamo detainees returning to terrorism
","For his entire term, former President Barack Obama wanted to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, but he was unsuccessful. President Donald Trump promises to keep it open, and he took to Twitter the morning of March 7 to criticize Obama for releasing Guantanamo detainees at all. ""122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield. Just another terrible decision!"" Trump tweeted — from both his personal account and the official White House account, @POTUS. Guantanamo detainee transfers are likely in the news because a March 2, 2017, U.S. military airstrike killed a former Guantanamo prisoner, Yasir Ali Abdallah al Silmi, who Obama released to Yemen in 2009. Trump’s claim that the Obama administration released 122 prisoners from Guantanamo that ""returned to the battlefield"" is right on the numbers but wrong on who is to blame. The vast majority of detainees who fall into Trump’s total were actually released during the administration of President George W. Bush. The 122 prisoners About every six months, the Director of National Intelligence releases figures about detainees transferred from Guantanamo and how many are known to have re-engaged in some sort of terrorist activity. The most recent report was published in September 2016 and includes data from 2002, when the prison opened, through July 2016. Here are the key figures: 693 detainees released from Guantanamo (532 while Bush was president, 161 during Obama’s two terms); of those: 122 confirmed of re-engaging in terrorist activity (113 Bush, 9 Obama); 86 suspected of re-engaging in terrorist activity, of those (75 Bush, 11 Obama); So in the 15 years between when Guantanamo opened in 2002 and when the latest data was collected in 2016, 122 detainees were transferred out of the prison who the government believes have returned to some sort of terrorist activity. However, just nine of those transfers happened during the Obama administration. The remaining 113 — or over 92 percent — happened under Bush. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer said in his March 7 press briefing that Trump meant ""in totality the number"" of individuals released from Guantanamo who returned to the battlefield. An expert view Talking to PolitiFact for a related article in January, DePaul University counterrorism professor Thomas Mockaitis raised questions about the veracity of the numbers because of difficulties in monitoring the former detainees’ and their activity. ""I do have concerns over the use of such figures without explanation or context,"" he said. ""Many of those released are handed over to foreign states who assume responsibility for them. Tracking their activities after they leave Guantanamo can be problematic."" In June 2014, the New America Foundation, a centrist think tank, compiled its own numbers of released former detainees, using Pentagon reports, news stories and other public information. At the time there were 620 released prisoners, and the foundation found that 54 of them ""are either confirmed to be or suspected of engaging in militant activities against either the U.S. or non-U.S. targets."" That was about one-third of the government’s figure of 184 at the time. The foundation has not updated the report since then. Our ruling Trump said, ""122 vicious prisoners, released by the Obama Administration from Gitmo, have returned to the battlefield."" The United States government has transferred nearly 700 detainees out of Guantanamo, and and 122 of them are ""confirmed of re-engaging"" in some sort of terrorist activity. But Trump wrongly rests the blame solely on the Obama administration. Of the 122 prisoners in question 113 were released before Obama took office. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False. Update: On March 7, after Trump made his claim, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence published updated data about recidivism of former Guantanmo detainees. As of Jan. 15, the DNI reports 121 former detainees confirmed of re-engaging in terrorism, eight of whom were released during the Obama administration. That's one fewer than the earlier data we used in our report. Our rating of Mostly False remains the same.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F83A00>],/factchecks/2017/mar/07/donald-trump/donald-trump-wrongly-blames-barack-obama-former-gu/

Report of man pardoned by Obama being arrested for murder is fake
","The author of a contrived news story about a man being arrested for killing his girlfriend after being pardoned by President Barack Obama says he made it up to show how easily people believe fake news. ""Man pardoned by Obama 3 months ago arrested for murder,"" read the headline on a Feb. 28, 2017, story on UndergroundNewsReport.com. Facebook flagged the story as being potentially false as part of its efforts to fight fake news in users’ feeds. The story has been shared on Facebook more than 23,000 times since being posted less than a week ago. The tale has wound up on other websites since then. The post claims a Gainesville, Fla., man named James G. Winters was arrested for killing girlfriend Joanna Walker and leaving her body in a car trunk in Orlando. Winters, it says, was pardoned by Obama just 94 days ago, freeing him from a life sentence for drug trafficking and weapons charges. These details are fake, although as in many fake news stories, there are some real roots to the premise. Obama granted 1,715 commutations and 212 pardons, the most of any president since Harry Truman. Many of these criminals were nonviolent drug offenders serving exceptionally long sentences under strict federal guidelines from decades ago. Obama had made easing these punishments a campaign promise, and had sought to aid hundreds of people who slipped through the cracks under sentencing revisions created through the Fair Sentencing Act of 2010. Part of Obama’s actions included granting pardons and sentence commutations. (We wrote an entire story about it, which you can read here.) One story circulated by Obama detractors was of Wendell Callahan, a convicted crack dealer who in 2016 was charged with killing a woman and her two children in Columbus, Ohio. Callahan had been freed under changes in the 2010 law, which Obama supported and signed. Callahan’s case is pending. But Winters hadn’t been freed by Obama, either by pardon or commutation. There is no James Winters on the list of 1,927 prisoners affected by executive action. The photo on the story is of Avery Draughty, a California man convicted of killing his neighbor in 2016.

Bogus claim that Jimmy Carter credits marijuana for curing his cancer is all smoke
","The Internet is getting a sustained buzz from a fake news story about former President Jimmy Carter saying marijuana cured his cancer, but the years-old hoax can only burn readers. ""Jimmy Carter: ‘Medical marijuana cured my cancer,’"" reads the headline on a post dated Dec. 8, 2015, from CannaSOS.com. The site says it is a social media platform where ""cannabis enthusiasts"" can discuss information related to marijuana. The post says Carter had become a cannabis connoisseur since being diagnosed, and credited a medical marijuana purveyor in Oakland, Calif., for helping find a proper strain of the drug. Facebook users flagged the story as being potentially fake, as part of the social media network’s efforts to thin out fake news stories. While the story goes back to 2015, it was shared on Facebook more than 1,000 times in the past seven months. Versions of the same story have appeared in links from other websites, as well. In 2015, Carter was really diagnosed with skin cancer that had spread to his brain, but in December of that year announced the cancer’s growth had been arrested and reversed. Instead of medical marijuana, Carter announced he had been trying a new drug called Keytruda that appeared to help control and reverse the metastatic melanoma.   The fake story, meanwhile, appears to have originated from a Dec. 7, 2015, post on a site called SatiraTribune.com. There’s no disclaimer on the site, but their Facebook page notes that SatiraTribune publishes ""satirical and futuristic news."" The story is full of cliches about smoking marijuana, including Carter being forgetful and having the munchies for peanuts. It also says Carter would be supporting legalization efforts in several states. (Four more states voted to allow recreational marijuana in 2016, while three others approved medical marijuana. That brings the total number of states with some form of legal marijuana to 28, plus the District of Columbia.) Carter’s own record on marijuana is a little hazier than the story makes it out to be. He suggested to Congress in 1977 that possession of up to one ounce of marijuana should be decriminalized, in an effort to keep people out of prisons for smoking the drug. When a CNN anchor asked him in 2012 whether he supported legalization, he said, ""I’m in favor of it. I think it’s OK."" He recently clarified his position in 2013: ""I do not favor legalization,"" he said at a meeting of state legislators and regulators. ""We must do everything we can to discourage marijuana use, as we do now with tobacco and excessive drinking."" But perhaps the biggest giveaway is a faked quote from Carter that reads, ""I smoke two joints in the morning, I smoke two joints at night, I smoke two joint in the afternoon, and it makes me feel all right."" That’s actually the opening line from The Toyes’ 1983 weed anthem ""Smoke Two Joints,"" although many people instead refer to Sublime’s 1992 cover, or even Macy Gray’s 2012 interpretation. We don’t know which version Carter would prefer. At any rate, this is a fake story that sparked a wave of readers being fooled.

Cuomo's budget includes more money for private schools than ever before
","The money religious elementary and high schools receive from New York state is at an all-time high, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo says. Cuomo made the claim at a student rally for the Orthodox Union, an organization that advocates on behalf of the Orthodox Jewish community. The group brought hundreds of students to the state capital to call for more state investment in private schools. ""My opinion is I aggressively support the religious schools,"" Cuomo said. ""My budget reflects that. I’ve given the religious schools in my budget more money than ever before in history. We did that last year, and we’ll do it again this year."" Cuomo sounded a different note in February at a rally in Buffalo. ""We don’t subsidize private high schools,"" Cuomo said. ""We have public high schools. If you want to go to a private high school, you go to a private high school."" So, which is it? Is the state giving more money to religious schools than ever before? Aid for private schools State lawmakers approved close to $192 million for non-public school in last year’s budget. The largest aid category reimburses schools for the costs of state mandates, like administering state tests and reporting data. That cost the state $104 million last year. The second largest program reimburses the schools for the cost of taking attendance throughout the school day as students change classes. Last year’s budget gave private schools close to $70 million for this cost. The state also provided significant aid for school safety equipment at non-public schools in recent years, starting in 2013. Non-public schools received $15 million last year, triple the amount given in 2013. The state provides $922,000 annually for additional academic support services for struggling students in non-public schools. That amount has remained steady since 2010. Private schools were also given $2 million last year to support the state Office of Religious and Independent Schools in the state Education Department. Budget numbers  The most money the state gave to private schools before Cuomo took office totaled $128.4 million in the 2007-2008 budget under then-Gov. Eliot Spitzer, according to the state Division of Budget. That aid dropped to about $110 million in 2010, the year Cuomo was elected. The aid fell to $101.3 million in Cuomo's first budget. Since then, state aid to private schools has almost doubled. Cuomo this year proposes another increase to $197.7 million in base aid for private schools. He proposes an extra $30 million in back payments for the cost of taking attendance, bringing his requested total aid to about $228 million. The state said it would start reimbursing private schools for attendance costs in 2004 but didn’t set aside funding for the program until the 2007-2008 budget. Cuomo’s plan gives these schools $30 million in this year’s budget, with a plan for $30 million more next year to correct the lag. Cuomo recently announced a proposal to give an additional $10 million to non-public schools for security costs, over the $15 million already included in his proposed budget. That addition would raise state spending to $238 million for private schools. The state spending per non-public student has also increased since Cuomo took office. The state spent about $218 per non-public student in Cuomo’s first budget. The per-student figure was $374 in the past school year. The state spends $9,330 per public school student on average. Non-religious private schools Most private schools in New York are affiliated with a religion, but some are not. In the 2015-2016 school year, about 459,000 students attended 1,752 private schools in New York according to data from the state Education Department. Close to 89,000, or about 19 percent of those students attended 495 schools not affiliated with a religion. The state Division of Budget does not track separate data on aid given to religious versus independent non-public schools. Our ruling ""I’ve given the religious schools in my budget more money than ever before in history,"" Cuomo says. Numbers from the state Division of Budget agree with Cuomo’s claim. He proposes more money for non-public schools in his budget this year than the state has ever before. Granted, not all private schools are religious. About one out of every five private students attend an independent non-public school. But we found no indication the state is treating religious schools differently than the non-religious private schools, so we rate his claim True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972115C0>],/factchecks/2017/mar/06/andrew-cuomo/cuomos-budget-includes-more-money-private-schools-/

Rats! Rumors of tons of rodent meat passed off as chicken wings in U.S. are fake news
","A fake news story that said some 150 tons of rat meat may be sold as chicken wings to deal with high demand during the Super Bowl is actually a trap for unwary readers. A Feb. 15, 2016, post on UrbanImageMagazine.com declared that ""300,000 pounds of rat meat sold as chicken wings across America."" Facebook flagged the story as potentially being made up as part of the social media company’s crackdown on fake news. Facebook said this particular post had been shared more than 178,000 times in the past year. We found other instances of the same story elsewhere, too. The fake story said the Food and Drug Administration was issuing a warning about rodents being sold as chicken wings after several shipping containers of rat meat were impounded coming into San Francisco from China. An official-sounding statement from the FDA warned that the rat meat coming into the United States was filtering into the food system to deal with a shortage of poultry leading up to the National Football League’s main event. The story warned that Americans should be vigilant about what they are eating, because it’s supposedly hard to tell the difference between rat meat and chicken wings. We’d think the substitution would be easy to spot, but apparently rat is most often caught masquerading as lamb. And while some east Asian cultures have been known to consume rat meat or pass it off as something else, we could find no reports of rodent flesh being impounded in San Francisco by the ton in 2016, 2017 or any other year. The UrbanImageMagazine.com post cited as its source a Feb. 6, 2016, story from WorldNewsDailyReport.com, a known peddler of fake articles. The site admits as much in its disclaimer, referring to ""the satirical nature of its articles and for the fictional nature of their content."" The original story posted a day before the Super Bowl was played on Feb. 7, 2016, as a joke ""warning"" people of counterfeit chicken wings. We contacted UrbanImageMagazine.com to ask if they knew the story was fake, but didn’t hear back. But we smell a rat, all right, and it’s the content of this story.

Has violent crime been on the rise in Calif. since 2011? Did it spike 12 % in 2015?
","Critics of the recent criminal justice reforms that have shifted thousands of California prisoners to local jails and reduced penalties for some offenses say those changes are responsible for an upsurge in crime across the Golden State. Republican state lawmakers and law enforcement leaders renewed their attacks on the reforms after a Whittier police officer was shot and killed Feb. 20, 2017. In addition, a Los Angeles County sheriff’s official claimed the suspect in the killing had been released early from prison due to these reforms, though that assertion was refuted by a state prisons spokesman. State Sen. Jeff Stone, R-Riverside County, said in a press release the day after the shooting that he ""will continue to stand up here in Sacramento against laws that allow dangerous criminals to be released on our streets."" He went on to say: ""Since the passage of Proposition 47 by voters in 2014 and the signing of AB 109 in 2011, violent crime has been on the rise in California, up 12 percent in 2015 statewide according to the FBI."" In this fact-check, we won’t tackle in-depth the question of whether these reforms are really responsible for an uptick in crime. That might be a topic for another day. Researchers at UC Irvine recently found ""very little evidence"" of crime increasing as a result of AB 109. We will, however, sort through Stone’s claim that violent crime ""has been on the rise"" since 2011. And his additional statement that there was a 12 percent spike in crime in 2015. Before we examine those claims, here’s a quick primer on the reforms Stone referenced: AB 109: Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed this reform into law in April 2011 to ease state prison overcrowding. It shifted nonviolent offenders from state prisons to county jails or placed them on probation under county supervision rather than parole under state supervision. Proposition 47: California voters approved this measure in November 2014. It downgraded drug possession and some thefts from felonies to misdemeanors and allowed tens of thousands of former offenders to remove felonies from their records. Law enforcement officials claim it allows repeat offenders to break the law with little consequence. Capital Public Radio file photo Our research We found there’s certainly truth to Stone’s statement about a recent increase in violent crime, but there are also some important details missing. Violent crimes include homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. Overall from 2011 to 2015, California’s violent crime rate increased by 3.1 percent, according to a review of data from the California Department of Justice’s report ""Crime in California 2015."" ""There’s been an increase there. It’s not huge,"" said Michael Rushford. president of the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a Sacramento-based nonprofit that tracks statewide crime statistics. Rushford believes the state’s early release laws have led to the uptick in crime. While the overall violent crime rate ticked up during this period, that increase was not consistent year-to-year. In 2012, it went up 2.7 percent from the previous year. In 2013, it dropped 6.5 percent. In 2014, there was a drop of less than one percent followed by an 8.4 percent increase in 2015. Violent crimes per 100,000 residents 2015 : 426.4 (8.4 percent increase from 2014) 2014 : 393.3 (0.90 percent decrease from 2013) 2013 : 396.9 (6.5 percent decrease from 2012) 2012 : 424.7 (2.7 percent increase from 2011) SOURCE: California Department of Justice ""Crime has sort of gone up and down,"" during this period, said Brandon Martin, a research associate who studies crime trends at the Public Policy Institute of California. ""Since 2011, only 2012 and 2015 are where we see crime increase for both property and violent crime."" Martin added that despite recent increases, crime rates in California remain near historic lows. SOURCE: Public Policy Institute of Califoria, ""Crime Trends in California."" 12 percent increase? The state justice department’s figures show an 8.4 percent rise in violent crime in 2015. That’s considerably smaller than the 12 percent increase Stone cites for the same year. We asked Stone’s spokesman for any additional evidence to back up his claim -- particularly his statement that there was a 12 percent increase in crime in 2015. His spokesman pointed to a January 2016 news article by CBS13, a Sacramento television station. The article cites a 12 percent statewide increase in violent crime between 2014 and 2015, attributing that data to the FBI. That figure, however, comes from an FBI report that examined only the first six months of 2015 -- and only looks at cities with populations of 100,000 or greater. A statewide look at the full year of 2015, including cities large and small, shows violent crime increased 8.4 percent. Our ruling California State Sen. Jeff Stone, R-Riverside County, recently claimed that ""Since the passage of Proposition 47 by voters in 2014 and the signing of AB 109 in 2011, violent crime has been on the rise in California, up 12 percent in 2015 statewide according to the FBI."" Stone is correct when looking at the overall violent crime rate. From 2011 to 2015, there was a 3.1 percent increase statewide in the rate of violent crimes, a category that includes homicides, rapes, robberies and aggravated assaults. Stone’s claim might give some the impression there’s been a consistent rise in crime during these years, which is not the case. The violent crime rate ratcheted up in 2012 and 2015, but went down in the other years. Also, the lawmaker’s claim that violent crime spiked 12 percent in 2015 is not correct; that figure comes from an FBI report that studies only the first six months of the year and only large cities. A full year, statewide report showed the violent crime rate increased 8.4 percent that year. In the end, we determined Stone’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097884F40>],/factchecks/2017/mar/06/jeff-stone-2/has-violent-crime-been-rise-california-2011-and-di/

Why the White House defense of Trump wiretap accusation is misleading
","President Donald Trump’s White House offered dubious explanations on the Sunday shows to defend Trump’s Twitter accusation that former President Barack Obama wiretapped phones at Trump Tower before the 2016 election. The president, a spokeswoman said on ABC’s This Week, didn’t come up with the storyline out of thin air. He was echoing reports from ""multiple news outlets."" ""Everybody acts like President Trump is the one that came up with this idea and just threw it out there,"" said deputy press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders on March 5. ""There are multiple news outlets that have reported this."" At one point in the segment, Sanders specifically named the New York Times and BBC as news outlets that have covered the wiretapping allegations. Show host Martha Raddatz pushed back and said Trump started this issue with his specific tweet. Sanders repeated her point: ""I hardly say he started this when there were multiple news reports prior to that."" If the basis of Trump's comment is media reports, he doesn't have a case.  A White House spokesperson sent PolitiFact five articles from the BBC, HeatStreet, the New York Times, the National Review and a transcript from Fox News’ Special Report with Bret Baier as evidence of Sanders’ claim. Before we get into those, it’s worth noting that many news outlets have suggested Trump’s remark was inspired by a March 3 post on Breitbart News. The post was not included by Trump’s team as backup, but the Breitbart article links to some of the other reports. The Breitbart article followed up on comments by Mark Levin on a March 2 segment of his conservative radio show. During the show, Levin claimed Obama’s administration used ""police state"" tactics in the fall to watch over Trump’s team. Trump sent his tweet early March 4. As of March 5, he had still not provided evidence. ""How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy!"" Trump wrote. How low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! The Breitbart article recapped 10 news events of the 2016 campaign that laid the foundation for Obama’s administration to ""eavesdrop on the Trump campaign."" Among the events included as an example is the Wikileaks release of emails from Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, which the Clinton campaign used to blame ""Trump and the Russians. The Breitbart article also mentions two requests under the the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, which grants a court the authority to grant (or deny) warrants for electronic surveillance. The reporting about FISA requests is taken from a Nov. 7, 2016, report from the conservative-leaning website called HeatStreet. HeatStreet published an article, it said, based on two unnamed sources.  ""The FBI sought, and was granted, a FISA court warrant in October, giving counterintelligence permission to examine the activities of ‘U.S. persons’ in Donald Trump’s campaign with ties to Russia,"" reads a line from the HeatStreet piece. The story says the FISA warrant was in relation to an investigation to the ""Trump campaign, and its alleged links to two banks; SVB Bank and Russia’s Alfa Bank.""  Other reports about this FISA requests come from the BBC and the Guardian. (The White House did not send the Guardian over as evidence.) Importantly, these sources do not back up Trump’s accusation that Obama himself ordered the wiretap as part of political sabotage. On Jan. 12, the BBC reported that lawyers from the National Security Division in the Department of Justice filed applications to the court that handles intelligence matters related to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA. ""A lawyer — outside the Department of Justice but familiar with the case — told me that three of Trump's associates were the subject of the inquiry,"" wrote Paul Wood, a British journalists who wrote the article in first person. The article did not say anything about Trump Tower. Six months earlier, the Guardian reported that the FBI applied for a warrant to monitor members of Trump’s teams interactions with Russia from the FISA court in June. The story was light on the details. It said the June application was turned down by the court, and briefly mentioned a report that the FBI was granted a warrant in October, but that has yet to be confirmed. Trump’s team also sent over two articles from the New York Times. These articles are about intelligence probes related to Trump associates and Russian officials. The first article, published on Jan. 12, reported that ""American law enforcement and intelligence agencies were examining communications and financial transactions as part of a broad investigation into possible links between Russian officials and associates of then- President-elect Trump."" At one point, the article indicates that intelligence reports stemming from the intercepts were given to Obama’s administration. ""One official said intelligence reports based on some of the wiretapped communications had been provided to the White House,"" it reads. The other article from Jan. 12 is about the Obama’s administration expanding the powers of the National Security Agency through new rules that relaxed limits on ""collecting satellite transmissions, phone calls and emails that cross network switches abroad, and messages between people abroad that cross domestic network switches."" Trump’s team also cited an article from the National Review as well as a March 3 Fox News interview between host Bret Baier and House Speaker Paul Ryan. The National Review article repeats the same information from HeatStreet. Baier asked Ryan about the report on FISA requests, which Ryan said he had not heard about. To be clear, that isn’t an example of Fox independently confirming the HeatStreet report. It’s worth noting that Obama's director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, said on NBC’s Meet the Press he was not aware of any wiretaps that Trump alleged. And Obama, through a spokesman, has denied wiretapping Trump Tower. And Obama officials have also said a president cannot unilaterally order a wiretap.  Our ruling Sanders said ""multiple news outlets"" have reported that Obama ordered wiretaps on Trump, including high-profile sources such as the New York Times and BBC. Trump’s team cited multiple reports to back up this claim, but it’s clear only one is at the root of Trump’s claim: a November 2016 blog post based on anonymous sources that has not been corroborated by independent U.S. journalists.  Trump's spokeswoman made it sound as if Trump was merely following a well-documented string of reports, but that is not the case. A few of the reports allude to the FBI requesting permission from FISA to eavesdrop on Trump’s associates, but none (minus the anonymously sourced website) definitively said the probes centered on Trump himself or came directly from Obama. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D44CC0>],/factchecks/2017/mar/05/sarah-huckabee-sanders/why-white-houses-defense-trump-accusing-obama-wire/

Here's where refugees settled in New York state in 2016
","A group of state lawmakers wants Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to include $12 million for refugee resettlement agencies in the next state budget. Federal funding for those agencies could be at risk if the U.S. places a temporary ban on refugees entering the country. President Donald Trump, in his January executive order on immigration, placed a temporary 120-day suspension on refugees entering the United States as well as a travel ban on seven mostly Muslim countries. That order has been halted by a federal judge. Trump also ordered limiting to 50,000 the number of refugees allowed into the U.S. in 2017. The number allowed into the U.S. was 110,000 under former President Barack Obama. The federal money goes to resettlement agencies when they receive new refugees. That funding could dry up with a refugee ban in place and if fewer refugees are placed in New York state. The state does not provide funding to these agencies. Assemblyman Sean Ryan, D-Buffalo, called the funding especially important for upstate communities, where most refugees are placed.  ""We know that refugees are a great economic driver in the communities we represent,"" Ryan said at a press conference. ""Just last year, over 5,000 refugees came to New York state, and 94 percent settled outside of New York City."" That number does not include the number of immigrants who entered New York last year. Immigrants are typically people who move somewhere by choice to improve their lives while refugees are trying to escape from persecution or armed conflict, like in Syria. Is Ryan right about how many refugees resettled in New York state last year? Federal fiscal year data  New York state accepted 5,026 refugees in the federal fiscal year that ran from October 2015 through September 2016, the third most in the country, according to the Department of State. Upstate New York accepted 4,722, or 94 percent, of the refugees. New York City accepted 5.6 percent of them. The few remaining refugees went to Long Island or the New York City suburbs.  Thirty-six percent of the refugees went to Erie County. Onondaga County took in the second-highest percentage of refugees, almost 25 percent. Calendar year data  Ryan did not say if he was talking about the 2016 federal fiscal year or the 2016 calendar year. The data is typically reported by federal fiscal year. We checked both. During the 2016 calendar year, 5,830 refugees were resettled in New York state. Upstate New York accepted 5,430, or 93 percent, of them. Downstate New York accepted the rest.  Erie and Onondaga counties also accepted the most refugees. Erie County took 1,966 of the state’s refugees. Onondaga accepted 1,092 refugees. Our ruling Ryan said, ""Just last year, over 5,000 refugees came to New York State, and 94 percent settled outside of New York City."" Department of State figures, collected during the refugee vetting process, support Ryan’s point. The numbers closely match data from both the federal fiscal year and the calendar year. We rate his claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC1300>],/factchecks/2017/mar/04/sean-ryan/heres-where-refugees-settled-new-york-2016/
