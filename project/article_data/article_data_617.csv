John Cox’s exaggerated claim: ‘Half the people’ want to leave California
","High taxes. Traffic-clogged freeways. Soaring housing costs. These are all reasons some Californians say they want to leave for less-expensive and lower-tax states from Arizona to Texas. But does half the state’s population really want to move out? That’s what Republican candidate for governor John Cox claimed in an interview on the Fox Business Network, which aired July 30, 2018.  The segment centered on the state’s high cost-of-living and Cox’s promise to help the ""forgotten Californians"" if elected. The San Diego businessman is running against Democratic Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom. Here’s the exchange between Fox host Charles Payne and Cox: Payne: ""It’s so bifurcated. Either you’re seriously wealthy, very, very wealthy where plastic surgeons have hundred million dollar homes. Or you’re extraordinarily poor and the people in the middle are trying to flee if they’re not stuck.""  Cox: ""And that’s the point, because fully half the people — our research is showing — half the people in this state, Charles, want to leave.""   Cox makes his claim in the video above.  We decided to fact-check Cox’s claim about ‘half the people in this state’ wanting to leave. Not a new trend California’s once-rapid population growth has slowed in recent decades. More people have been leaving for other states than have been moving in for many years, according to a February 2018 study by the California Legislative Analyst’s Office. About five million people moved to California from other states, while about six million left the state from 2007 to 2016, according to the LAO report, which cited data from the American Community Survey. That doesn’t mean, however, that California’s overall population is in decline. Just the opposite: It’s grown by an average 333,000 people per year since 2010 largely due to natural births and international migration. California was home to 39.8 million people as of January 2018, according to the California Department of Finance. That included an increase of 309,000 residents in 2017 alone and nearly 2.3 million over seven years. Half the state wants to leave?  To examine Cox’s claim, we reviewed two independent polls that raised a similar question. They didn’t find 50 percent of people wanting to flee. But they did find sizeable, if somewhat smaller, portions of the state at least considering it. In its September 2017 survey, the Public Policy Institute of California asked whether California’s high housing costs were making them consider moving. It found: ""About four in ten Californians (44 percent adults, 41 percent likely voters) say the cost of their housing is making them seriously consider moving away from the part of California they live in now."" Here’s the PPIC survey’s breakdown of where that 44 percent would consider moving to: • 33 percent outside the state; • 10 percent elsewhere in California; • 1 percent listed as ""other."" UC Berkeley survey A September 2017 survey by the UC Berkeley Institute of Governmental Studies found 56 percent of Californians had considered moving because of rising housing costs, though not necessarily out of the state. Only 25 of those surveyed said that, if they moved, it would most likely be to another state. Another 2 percent said they’d move to another country. Meanwhile, 23 percent of respondents said they would most likely move to another part of California or another place in their general area, if they relocated. Cox’s response  Cox’s spokesman Matt Shupe told us the candidate was referencing the campaign’s internal polling. He provided information about June and August surveys that asked people their opinion on repealing the state gas tax increase; whether California government is on the right track; and whether the standard of living for most middle-class and working families was improving, getting worse or remaining flat. It then asked: ""Over the next few years, how likely is it that you would move out of state?"" The June poll showed 21 percent answered ""very likely"" and 29 percent ""somewhat likely"" for a total of 50 percent. The August survey totaled 52 percent for those answers. The internal poll was conducted online and has a smaller sample size than the independent surveys. It conducted 800 interviews, while the PPIC survey spoke with 1,700 people and UC Berkeley interviewed 1,200. Also, Cox’s internal poll and the UC Berkeley survey spoke only with registered voters. PPIC’s survey includes responses from registered and non-registered Californians. ""For us, we need to represent the entire population,"" said Mark Baldassare, PPIC’s president and survey director. Cox’s spokesman also cited a poll by the Bay Area Council showing 46 percent of voters either somewhat or strongly feel they are ""likely to move out of the Bay Area in the next few years."" That poll, however, did not examine attitudes statewide. Our ruling  Republican candidate for governor John Cox claimed in a recent Fox Business Network interview that ""Fully half the people — our research is showing — half the people in this state … want to leave."" Independent polls place that share at one-quarter to one-third of Californians. That’s still a large amount but not half. Internal polls commissioned by the Cox campaign, and using a smaller sample size, show 50 percent of those asked were either ""very likely"" or ""somewhat likely"" to move out of the state over the next few years. Cox’s statement, while it includes the caveat that ""our research is showing,""  leaves the impression for the average viewer that it’s a settled fact that half of California wants to move out. But that’s only the case if one relies on internal figures from the campaign, and ignores results from two outside surveys with much larger samples. His claim is partially accurate, but it leaves out important details and takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.

Donald Trump wrongly says Social Security and Medicare are stronger
","President Donald Trump is rejecting the image of policy chaos and bitter staff infighting captured in the latest book by Washington Post editor Bob Woodward. At a meeting with Kuwait’s leader Sheikh Al-Sabah, Trump called the book ""fiction"" and said in contrast to what it describes, no administration has gotten more done on tax cuts, deregulation and the courts than his. And the accomplishments don’t end there. ""We’re saving Medicare,"" Trump said Sept. 5. ""The Democrats want to destroy Medicare. If you look at what they’re doing, they’re going to destroy Medicare. And we will save it. We will keep it going. We’re making it stronger. We’re making Social Security stronger. We’re making our whole country stronger. So all you have to do is look at the achievements."" In this fact-check, we look at whether the Trump administration has made Medicare and Social Security stronger. Compared with estimates a year ago, the primary trust fund for Medicare runs out three years sooner. The primary trust fund for Social Security runs out one year sooner. The Republican tax cuts trimmed a year of solvency from the primary Medicare trust fund and had a negative effect on the Social Security trust fund. Medicare serves almost one out of six Americans. It’s primarily health insurance for people 65 and older, but it also helps millions of citizens with disabilities. Medicare’s core program, Part A, covers hospital care, and it’s an entitlement. Anyone who qualifies gets the coverage and the government funding is automatic, not subject to the annual budget decisions of Congress. The money for Part A comes out of the Hospital Insurance Trust Fund. Payroll taxes provide about 90 percent of the trust fund’s income. Coming in a distant second are taxes on wealthier Social Security recipients, which provide about 8 percent of total revenues. In their 2018 report, the Medicare Trustees forecast that fund would run out of money in 2026. A year earlier, they said it would last until 2029. On Trump’s watch, it lost three years of solvency. In a presentation at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, the chief actuary at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Paul Spitalnic said two of the lost years were due to lower than expected wage growth. But the other lost year came from the Republican tax cuts. ""The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 decreased individual tax rates and as a result, there is somewhat less income coming into the trust fund,"" Spitalnic said. ""That does have an effect of making depletion of the trust fund a year earlier.""  The tax cut law had a similar impact on Social Security. Social Security has two parts -- the Old Age and Survivors Trust Fund, which served 51 million people in 2017, and the Disability Trust Fund, which served 10 million. According to the 2018 Social Security Trustees report, the total price tag in 2017 was $952 billion. The Old Age and Survivors fund is the big one for retired people, with about $2.8 trillion. The Disability fund had $71 billion at the end of 2017. With costs rising faster than income, the larger fund is expected to run dry in 2034. A year earlier, the projection was for 2035. So that’s a loss of one year of solvency. The trustees listed several factors for the worsening situation, including the tax cut law, the expected end of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, an immigration program Trump opposes), and lower-than-expected wage increases. All three reduced the dollars coming into the trust fund. The one bright spot was with the Disability Insurance Trust Fund. While by far the smaller of the two, its projected solvency date was extended by four years, driven by a fall in the number of people claiming benefits. White House staff noted that the economy is growing and growth helps Social Security and Medicare. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said the same when the latest trustees reports came out in June. Not all economists agree that growth will solve all. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a deficit control group, argues that growth leads to higher prices, which in turn increases program costs. The White House also said payroll contributions are up since last year. But unless revenues come in faster than outlays, the trust funds continue to lose ground. We asked Olivia Mitchell, a professor and leading analyst of social insurance funds at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, how she would assess the status of Social Security and Medicare. ""Trump’s administration has done nothing to strengthen Social Security or Medicare,"" Mitchell said. Health policy professor Paul Ginsburg with the University of Southern California and the Brookings Institution told us that he’s hard pressed to remember a tax bill that left the Medicare trust fund worse off. ""The recent change, where legislation moved the date forward, is very unusual and reflects the unusual and dangerous mindset in Congress of not caring about increases in the deficit,"" Ginsburg said. Trump said that his administration is making Medicare and Social Security stronger. The forecast for both programs is worse today than a year ago. The main Medicare trust fund is expected to run out of money three years sooner. The main Social Security trust fund is expected to run out one year sooner. The Republican tax cut law and lower-than-projected wages accounted for most of the downgrade. We rate this claim False.","[('Donald Trump, Remarks by President Trump and Amir Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah of the State of Kuwait Before Bilateral Meeting, Sept. 5, 2018', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/remarks-president-trump-amir-sheikh-sabah-al-ahmed-al-jaber-al-sabah-state-kuwait-bilateral-meeting/'), ('Social Security Administration, The 2018 OASDI Trustees Report, June 5, 2018', 'No link'), ('Medicare Trustees, Medicare amendments since the 2017 report, June 5, 2018', 'https://www.ssa.gov/OACT/TR/2018/'), ('Medicare Trustees, 2018 report, June 5, 2018', 'No link'), ('American Enterprise Institute, The 2018 Medicare Trustees Report: Fiscal challenges and future reforms, June 6, 2018', 'https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ReportsTrustFunds/Downloads/TR2018.pdf#page=174'), (""Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Analysis of the 2018 Medicare Trustees' Report, June 7, 2018"", 'No link'), ('U.S. Treasury Department, Statement by Secretary Mnuchin on the Spring 2018 Meeting of the Social Security and Medicare Board of Trustees, June 5, 2018', 'https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/ReportsTrustFunds/Downloads/TR2018.pdf'), ('American Academy of Actuaries, Making issues count - Medicare, 2018', 'No link'), ('Tax Policy Center, What is the Medicare trust fund, and how is it financed?, 2016', 'https://www.aei.org/events/the-2018-medicare-trustees-report-fiscal-challenges-and-future-reforms/'), ('Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, Can We Grow Our Way Out of Debt?, Aug. 5, 2015', 'No link'), ('Interview, Paul Ginsburg, director, USC-Brookings Schaeffer Initiative for Health Policy, Sept. 6, 2018', 'http://www.crfb.org/papers/analysis-2018-medicare-trustees-report'), ('Email interview, Olivia S.

"['New York', 'Guns', 'Andrew Cuomo']","
Cuomo claims his gun control law is toughest
","In his campaign for re-election, Gov. Andrew Cuomo faces a primary challenge from Cynthia Nixon, and he points to his record as proof that he can be a line of defense against President Trump’s policies. Part of Cuomo’s record is the Secure Ammunition and Firearms Enforcement Act, often referred to as the SAFE Act. ""We passed the toughest gun control law in the United States of America, the SAFE Act,"" Cuomo said at the Democratic gubernatorial primary debate at Hofstra University. ""He will roll it back with his Supreme Court. He has to be stopped,"" Cuomo said of Trump. Cuomo has called the SAFE Act the nation’s toughest gun control legislation several times since he signed it into law in January 2013. He includes a similar claim on his campaign website. So is Cuomo right? Is the SAFE Act the nation’s toughest gun control law? Background New York was the first state to pass major gun control legislation after a gunman fatally shot 20 children and six adults on Dec. 14, 2012, at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn. Cuomo used a message of necessity to hasten passage of the law. The SAFE Act has several provisions, including a ban on certain semiautomatic weapons, a requirement that ammunition be purchased through a dealer who performs a background check on the buyer, and background checks for buyers who purchase guns through private sales. The act also included provisions to keep guns away from people with mental illness. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence called it a ""model for the nation."" Some of the law’s provisions were challenged in court, including a provision that magazine capacity be seven rounds instead of 10, which a federal judge struck down. Other legal challenges to the law were not successful. Though the SAFE Act was controversial in parts of the state, Cuomo has continued to pursue gun control policies during his tenure. His actions have attracted negative attention from the country’s most powerful gun rights group, the National Rifle Association, as he pursues a third term. But is it the toughest?  Cuomo calls the SAFE Act the toughest gun legislation in the country. News outlets echoed that language when it was passed. The New York law ranks as the nation’s toughest by virtue of ""mandating universal background checks, creating a first-of-its-kind mental health database, closing the gun-show loophole, and strengthening the state’s ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines,"" said Cuomo spokeswoman Abbey Collins.  At least one gun control research think tank considers the SAFE Act the most comprehensive measure passed in 2013. The Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, which tracks legislation around the country and assists lawmakers in crafting gun control measures, characterized ""the SAFE Act as the most comprehensive law"" enacted that year because it included ""many different areas of gun violence prevention, more so than any other law enacted that year,"" according to a statement from Jason Phelps, the law center’s national press secretary. Phelps declined to use ""toughest"" to describe the law. He said the word is subjective and could have different meanings to different people and organizations. ""Accordingly, we do not think it is unfair or inaccurate for Gov. Cuomo to characterize the SAFE Act as the toughest law enacted that year,"" Phelps said. But that is not the whole story.      In several scorecards rating states for gun laws, New York does not come in first, either in 2013 or in later years, for the toughest. The Brady Campaign and Giffords Law Center’s joint 2013 evaluation of state gun laws puts New York in fifth place for strongest laws, after California, Connecticut, New Jersey, and Maryland. New York moved up from sixth place on Giffords’ 2012 state scorecard. Giffords also ranked New York fifth in its most recent ranking.   In the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence’s most recent evaluation of the ""strongest"" state laws, published in March 2015, New York also came in fifth, after California, Connecticut, Massachusetts and New Jersey. Giffords and the Brady Campaign have endorsed Cuomo in his re-election bid. Our ruling Cuomo claims New York enacted the toughest gun law. At least one gun violence prevention research outfit agrees with him. But while the SAFE Act on the whole may be tougher than other states’ individual gun laws, when several other states’ individual gun laws are taken together, they consistently rank higher than New York for toughness. We rate this claim Mostly False.  ","[('Sources:', 'https://newyork.cbslocal.com/video/3926086-ny-democratic-gubernatorial-debate-andrew-cuomo-v-cynthia-nixon/'), ('Gubernatorial debate, Andrew Cuomo and Cynthia Nixon, aired on CBS2 and taped at Hofstra University on Aug. 29, 2018, accessed Aug. 29, 2018 and Aug. 30, 2018.', 'No link'), ('Telephone conversations, email correspondence with Cuomo campaign spokeswoman Abbey Collins, Aug. 31, 2018, Sept. 4, 2018, Sept. 5, 2018.', 'http://www.bradycampaign.org/brady-campaign-statement-on-passage-of-gun-legislation-in-new-york'), ('Telephone conversation and email correspondence with Max Samis, press secretary, Brady Campaign and Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Aug. 30, 2018, Sept. 5, 2018.', 'No link'), ('Brady Campaign Statement on Passage of Gun Legislation in New York, Jan. 15, 2013.

It's largely accurate that manufacturing jobs have been on a roll
","Have manufacturing jobs been on the rise more quickly than in two decades? The West Virginia Republican Party touted gains in manufacturing employment in a tweet on Aug. 7. ""Thanks to President Trump and Republicans over the past year through July, U.S. manufacturing added 327,000 jobs, the most of any 12-month period since April 1995, when the figure added a healthy 345,000 positions,"" the tweet said. Thanks to President Trump and Republicans over the past year through July, U.S. manufacturing added 327,000 jobs, the most of any 12-month period since April 1995, when the figure added a healthy 345,000 positions. https://t.co/ilNhBoBzED #WVGOP To support its assertion, the state party tweeted a link to a CNBC article that included that text verbatim. How accurate are those numbers? They check out. Between the months of July 2017-July 2018, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a gain of 327,000 jobs in manufacturing, just as the CNBC article said. We looked at the previous July-to-July gains or losses in manufacturing jobs going back to 1994-95 and found that the 2018 performance was easily the best during that period. Here are the results: We also confirmed that from April 1994 to April 1995, the economy gained 345,000 manufacturing jobs. The intervening periods -- May 1994 to May 1995, and June 1994 to June 1994 -- both fell short of 345,000. We’ll note that manufacturing jobs are only slowly recovering the ground they have lost since the 1980s, and especially after the Great Recession in 2008 and 2009. Here’s the long view of manufacturing employment in the United States:  To the extent that manufacturing employment has been increasing, it’s been doing so at a fairly steady -- if modest -- rate since 2010, including more than six years on President Barack Obama’s watch. In addition, while the tweet gave Trump and Republicans credit for the recent gain, economists say presidents don’t deserve either full credit or full blame for employment trends on their watch. The president is not all-powerful on economic matters; broader factors, from the business cycle to changes in technology to demographic shifts, play major roles. The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, ""Thanks to President Trump and Republicans over the past year through July, U.S. manufacturing added 327,000 jobs, the most of any 12-month period since April 1995, when the figure added a healthy 345,000 positions."" The numbers and the length of time are accurate. It’s worth noting, however, that the climb has been under way for years, and that many factors play a role in such economic achievements, not just the president or his party. The statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.","[('West Virginia Republican Party, tweet, Aug. 7, 2018', 'https://twitter.com/WVGOP/status/1026815222718259201'), ('\u200bFederal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, ""All Employees, manufacturing."" accessed Aug. 30, 2018', 'No link'), ('CNBC, ""Job gains for the manufacturing industry in the last 12 months are the most since 1995,"" Aug. 3, 2018', 'https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/MANEMP'), ('PolitiFact, Fact-checking Donald Trump’s talking points about the economy, July 27, 2018', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2018/sep/06/west-virginia-republican-party/its-largely-accurate-manufacturing-jobs-have-been-/

The National Republican Congressional Committee actually said in ripping one of the ads that Kohl is correct in saying he’s not a politician. But the group, which works to elect Republicans to the House, also cited to us evidence that he is a politician. So, let’s take a look. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. No clear definition As we noted in our Bryce fact check, dictionaries aren’t much help, given how widely the definitions of politician vary: Merriam-Webster Experienced in the art or science of government; especially one actively engaged in conducting the business of a government. Dictionary.com Active in party politics. Safire’s Political Dictionary Engages in a career either in government or in a political party on a full-time, usually professional basis. Vocabulary.com Campaigns for or holds a position in government. But the more, and more deeply, involved you become in politics, the closer you are to being a politician. Kohl’s resume Kohl has never held office, and has run only once before. So, that differentiates him from Bryce. But Kohl has been involved in politics, in a more behind-the-scenes way. Here’s more detail on Kohl’s professional life after he earned a law degree from the University of Wisconsin in 1992, based on information from his campaign website; the business networking site LinkedIn; Vote Smart, a website that backgrounds candidates and elected officials; and news accounts: 1992-2006 Works for the Milwaukee Bucks, a National Basketball Association franchise then owned by Herb Kohl. Dan worked in a variety of positions, ultimately serving as assistant general manager. 2008 Defeated in the Democratic primary in a run for a suburban Milwaukee seat in the Wisconsin Assembly. At the time, he was director of new schools development in Wisconsin for the Washington, D.C.-based SEED Foundation, which develops boarding schools for at-risk students. 2009-2012 Vice president of political affairs and political director of J Street, a liberal pro-Israel advocacy group. According to Kohl’s campaign website, he ""oversaw the development of the nation’s largest pro-Israel political action committee."" J Street described Kohl as a veteran political activist and fundraiser ""with close ties to the senior leadership of the Democratic party."" He served as a ""bundler"" of contributions for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama. 2013-2017 Senior adviser and lobbyist at BakerHostetler, a large law and lobbying firm in Washington, D.C. 2017 Settles in Mequon, an upscale suburb of Milwaukee, in May, announces his campaign for Grothman’s seat in June. Our rating Kohl says: ""I'm not a politician."" In a strict sense, he’s not, given that he’s never held public office and this is only his second run in the past 10 years. But Kohl also spent a total of eight years as a Washington, D.C., lobbyist and senior member of a Washington-based advocacy group, in addition to being a major fundraiser for presidential candidates.

No, Florida's Andrew Gillum does not have a far left socialist platform
","In the race for Florida governor, Republican Ron DeSantis is trying to paint Democrat Andrew Gillum as so far out of the mainstream that Gillum ""wants to turn Florida into Venezuela,"" a reference to the failing socialist country. ""The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state,"" DeSantis said on Fox News.  DeSantis’ comments were more controversial because of his use of the phrase ""monkey this up"" (Gillum is African-American). DeSantis said his comments had nothing to do with race. ""It had to do with his far-left socialist platform,"" DeSantis said in a subsequent interview on Laura Ingraham’s radio show. So, is Gillum’s platform far-left socialist? While there is a level of subjectivity in describing a politician’s political views, we can measure just how far left or out of the mainstream Gillum is. The DeSantis campaign said ""Gillum’s socialism"" includes his support for Medicare for All, which would provide health care to everyone. (A governor can’t change federal health care policy, but Gillum says he will champion it.) Gillum also proposed increasing the state corporate tax rate from 5.5 percent to 7.75 percent and the minimum wage from $8.25 to $15 an hour. DeSantis also points to Gillum’s endorsement by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who has called himself a socialist or a democratic socialist. (Gillum endorsed Hillary Clinton over Sanders in the 2016 presidential primary.) Gillum was asked during a 2018 primary forum if he is a socialist or a capitalist. ""I am a Democrat and an individual in this state who believes that we've had a rough ride these last several years,"" Gillum said. ""People are working, many of them harder than ever, and still can't bring down a wage where they can make ends meet."" For Floridians who are struggling, he said, ""these labels mean nothing."" After he won the primary, MSNBC’s Chuck Todd asked Gillum if he is a socialist. This time, he rejected the socialist label outright. ""No, I’m a Democrat. I ran as a Democrat, I am a Democrat. And, frankly, the values that I hold, I think, are consistent with the values of the Democratic Party. In fact, I think they are the values shared by the majority of Floridians."" The narrowest definition of socialism involves a state owning all businesses, with a ban on private economic activity above some level, said Daniel Shaviro, a tax law professor at New York University law school. But when Sanders uses the term, he is referring to the generous social insurance programs available not only in the Scandinavian countries but also France and Germany, along with high tax rates if needed. ""But note that U.S. tax rates in the early 1960s exceeded 90 percent,"" Shaviro said. ""Were we a ‘socialist’ country then? At the time, only the John Birch Society — not even Barry Goldwater — was saying so."" We sent experts on political philosophy a list of Gillum’s policy positions. Experts generally told us that it’s misleading to state that Gillum has a ""socialist platform"" — he hasn’t advocated that the government control all forms of enterprise. If we examine socialism on a continuum, experts said some of Gillum’s  policies are further from socialism and some are closer to it. Peter Dreier, a political science professor at Occidental College, said that for decades Republicans have used the ""socialist"" label to attack Democrats over policies including the New Deal in the 1930s and the Civil Rights Act in the 1960s. Many of the ideas that were once considered ""socialist"" — such as  the minimum wage, women’s right to vote, and Social Security — are now mainstream.   Back in the 1960s, when President Lyndon Johnson proposed Medicare, some Republican opponents called it ""socialist."" But now Americans overwhelmingly support Medicare. In Florida, about one in five people are on Medicare, among the highest rates in the country. Medicare for All would essentially expand an existing program, and some polls show a majority of Americans support Medicare for All. ""Gillum is definitely not a socialist,"" Dreier said. ""He is a mainstream liberal Democrat."" Mac Stipanovich, a Florida Republican strategist and critic of President Donald Trump, said in an op-ed in the Tampa Bay Times that what Gillum wants is an expansion of Medicare, minimum wage and public education. But the programs themselves are broadly supported. ""If supporting these socialist programs makes one a socialist, then Gillum is indeed a socialist, as is certainly almost every elected official in Florida, Democrats or Republicans,"" Stipanovich wrote. ""A phone booth could not be filled with politicians of any stripe who oppose Medicare, any minimum wage at all, and public schools."" Antony Davies, an economics professor at Duquesne University, said that Medicare fits the common definition of socialism because it is a program by which the government forces one group of people (wage earners) to pay for health insurance, and forces another group (retirees) to consume health insurance. ""Thus, Medicare for All will have the government exerting even more control over people than it does under Medicare,"" he said. So, broadly speaking, Gillum’s position of expanding health care access is rooted in the mainstream rather than the far left. So where might his positions shift toward something approximating socialism? Raising the corporate rate is closer to socialism, in the sense that you could say a 0 percent rate is the most ""capitalistic"" and a 100 percent rate the most ""socialistic,"" Shaviro said. One could make a similar argument about the minimum wage too, but the minimum wage was far higher, relative to inflation, for most of the post-World War II period than it is now. And a majority of Americans have supported increasing the minimum wage. ""The real point is that almost no one favors an absolutely pure market system with no government taxation or regulation, and no one in U.S. politics supports going 100 percent the other way, so we’re all just debating mixed systems and it’s not a matter of ‘socialists’ vs. ‘pro-capitalists.’"" Eduardo A. Gamarra, a political science professor at Florida International University, said the comment by DeSantis that Gillum wants to turn Florida into Venezuela is ""ludicrous."" Venezuela has devolved because it mismanaged its oil resources. Florida has a more diversified economy that doesn’t rely on one product. ""I don’t think Gillum is talking about nationalizing industries and taking over hotels,"" Gamarra said. ""That’s just not going to happen."" DeSantis said Gillum has a ""far left socialist platform."" The reality is Gillum’s platform resembles the policies being promoted by many Democrats. And his positions of expanding access to Medicare and raising the minimum wage have significant public support. Gillum isn’t on the fringes of the political spectrum and certainly proposes nothing approaching turning ""Florida into Venezuela,"" which would mean the state taking over privately held businesses and large portions of the economy. We rate this statement False.","[('Fox News, Laura Ingraham interview with Andrew Gillum, Aug. 28, 2018', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hHgl-1OrIVY'), ('Fox News, Ingraham Angle, Aug. 29, 2018', 'No link'), ('The Laura Ingraham Show Podcast, Aug. 30, 2018', 'https://video.foxnews.com/v/5828667047001/?#sp=show-clips'), ('U.S. Rep.

Ted Cruz falsely says Beto O'Rourke said he was 'grateful' for U.S. flag burners
","Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, striving to define his Democratic challenger before voters make up their minds, posted a video snippet indicating Beto O’Rourke gave public thanks for people who trample or burn the American flag. We confirmed that O’Rourke, who represents El Paso in the U.S. House, recently fielded a crowd member’s question about his position on flag desecration. But O’Rourke’s reply didn’t directly take that up, instead revisiting his support of non-violent protests for civil rights and against police misbehavior--which previously extended to his support for NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. Let’s cover Cruz’s claim, then turn to the question posed to O’Rourke and what O’Rourke said. Cruz’s video A 25-second video released Sept. 4, 2018 by Cruz’s campaign opens by showing O’Rourke standing with a microphone in front of Texas and U.S. flags as an audience member is heard saying that ""the reason I ask this question is as a voter, I don’t know how I would feel to have my own elected representative being open to kneeling on the Senate floor or encouraging and supporting acts that desecrate our American flag."" Next, the video goes silent as text appears: ""Beto O’Rourke was asked his views on burning or desecrating the American flag. This was his answer."" Finally, the video shows O’Rourke saying: ""I think there is something inherently American about that. And so I’m grateful that people are willing to do that."" Cruz’s campaign also issued a press release stating O’Rourke had made his comment at a town hall the day before, Labor Day. To our inquiry, Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier corrected that timing, saying by email that O’Rourke fielded the question and made his reply at an El Paso town hall Aug. 31, 2018. Frazier also pointed us to the O’Rourke campaign’s post of its Facebook Live video of the town hall, including the full question and answer, and she shared what she described as a transcript of the key question and answer, which we slightly amended after watching the video. The question: ""My question is with regards to your remark that there is nothing more patriotic than for NFL players, when discussing NFL players kneeling during the national anthem. And I'm curious as to know if you hold the landmark Texas Supreme Court case—well, the Supreme Court case Texas versus Johnson—to that same standard, where a man was charged for burning and desecrating an American flag on the state Capitol. And do you disagree with the dissenting opinion that the American flag is a unifying symbol that should be respected and revered, as it plays no politics? And I guess the reason I ask this question is, as a voter, I don't know how I would feel to have my own elected representative being open to kneeling on the Senate floor or encouraging and supporting acts that desecrate our American flag."" O’Rourke’s reply: ""My comments about there being nothing more American were about being—there's nothing more American than standing up for, or in this case kneeling for, your rights under the Constitution. When the women and men who are serving in Afghanistan, in Iraq, in Syria tonight, the gentleman who served in Vietnam—when they serve this country, they're not serving a president, they're not serving a political party. They swear their allegiance to the Constitution. This idea that we are a country of laws and that no woman and no man is above or below those laws. ""When some people are treated differently because of their race—and we're reminded of the fact that it is not just in the distant past. For someone born in 1972 such as I, that might be the Freedom Riders in the 1960s who rode those Greyhound buses through Mississippi and Alabama and Georgia, and in so doing as African-American women and men, took their lives into their hands, put them on the line. And in many cases those who stood up for civil rights lose their lives in the process. Many were beaten to within an inch of their lives to ensure better civil rights for every single American. ""They got us a lot closer than we were before. Witness the Voting Rights Act from 53 years, the civil rights act from 54 years ago. Those would not have been signed into law by Lyndon Baines Johnson if people had not protested, if Rosa Parks had not moved from the back of the bus to the front of the bus. If our young fellow Americans of different colors did not have the audacity and the boldness and the courage to sit at lunch counters knowing that they would be humiliated, knowing that they would be spat upon, knowing that they would be dragged out in front of their fellow human beings. They did all of that to stand up for the equal treatment under law of everyone. ""Now, part of the genius of this country, and I think no one expresses it more brilliantly than Martin Luther King Jr., is that in the face of injustice, in the face sometimes of violence, in the face of the very real possibility that you will lose your life in the process, people have been willing to non-violently and peacefully protest to seek political solutions to otherwise intractable problems. ""When you have unarmed black men in this country all too often being killed, and sometimes being killed by members of law enforcement—and those members of law enforcement—as I see a former chief of police for the El Paso Police Department, a former county commissioner, someone who exemplifies the best in public service—those are among the very toughest jobs that anyone in any community can hold. Those are also people who put their lives on the line, securing and protecting their fellow citizens in these communities. ""But when there is use of force, when there is a life taken and there is not accountability, there is not justice done, there's not the ability to prevent that from continuing to happen in the future, and someone is willing—is willing—to call attention to that, to try to awaken our conscience, to force us to do the right thing, in the face of that injustice and violence and to do so peacefully and non-violently—I think that there is something inherently American about that. And so I—I—I'm grateful that people are willing to do that. I understand that people can come down to a different conclusion on this issue and I respect that, as well. That's American as well. But those are my feelings on the issue and I’m grateful for the question."" O’Rourke before When we asked O’Rourke’s campaign about Cruz’s claim, spokesman Chris Evans noted by email a Sept. 4, 2018 Dallas Morning News article flagging the claim as false. Evans, asked if O’Rourke had aired a position on flag burning, pointed out a Sept. 4, 2018 Corpus Christi Caller news story quoting O’Rourke saying after an Aug. 27 event in Austin: ""I don't think anyone should burn an American flag. I also don't think this is about flags. It's about people's lives. It's about civil rights. It's about making sure that everyone has an opportunity to succeed and that there is justice and accountability for everyone in this country."" We shared that comment with Frazier, who wondered in reply why O’Rourke didn’t say as much in response to the question in El Paso. Frazier suggested too that reasonable people would interpret O’Rourke saying ""that is inherently American"" and ""I’m grateful that people are willing to do that"" to be answering the crowd member’s question about people who burn the flag in protest. Supreme Court case And what about that Supreme Court case? By 5-4, the court held in Johnson v. Texas in 1989 that a state couldn’t bar anyone from desecrating the flag due to the First Amendment though the incident itself occurred in 1984 outside the Republican National Convention in Dallas--not at the Texas Capitol. By phone, constitutional scholar Sanford Levinson, a University of Texas law professor, said the court majority, including conservative Justice Antonin Scalia, agreed that flag-burning was protected by the free speech provision in the First Amendment. Regardless, Levinson said, ""flag burning is dumb as political technique because you can predict it will alienate far more people than it will encourage."" Chief Justice William Rehnquist’s dissent in the case, joined by two justices, said: ""For more than 200 years, the American flag has occupied a unique position as the symbol of our Nation, a uniqueness that justifies a governmental prohibition against flag burning."" Levinson summed up: ""It was not a case about whether or not someone respected the flag. It was about whether you could be jailed if you disrespected it."" Our ruling Cruz said O’Rourke said he’s ""grateful"" that people are burning or desecrating the American flag. O’Rourke was asked to speak to a Supreme Court ruling that upheld the right to desecrate the flag in nonviolent protest. However, his answer didn’t go there, instead focusing on his support of protests for civil rights and other causes. O'Rourke earlier said he didn't think anyone should burn an American flag.

It also prompted a false article from Conservative Columns claiming Kaepernick made an ""anti-white rant"" that resulted in him losing the deal. The Conservative Columns website has since been taken down. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Then a San Francisco 49ers quarterback, Kaepernick started kneeling during the national anthem before games in 2016 to protest the treatment of people of color in the United States. ""I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color,"" Kaepernick told NFL Media in 2016. ""To me, this is bigger than football and it would be selfish on my part to look the other way. There are bodies in the street and people getting paid leave and getting away with murder."" Since then, other NFL players have continued to protest, either by kneeling or by other gestures. President Donald Trump has weighed in numerous times, saying that the NFL should fire or suspend protesting players. ""Just like the NFL, whose ratings have gone WAY DOWN, Nike is getting absolutely killed with anger and boycotts,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday. ""I wonder if they had any idea that it would be this way? As far as the NFL is concerned, I just find it hard to watch, and always will, until they stand for the FLAG!"" The Nike deal comes after Kaepernick has not had an NFL contract for more than a year-and-a-half. Last week, an arbitrator denied the NFL’s request to dismiss Kaepernick’s collusion complaint that claims NFL owners have kept him off the field because of his protests, not because of his football ability.

Donald Trump inaccurately describes libel law
","Donald Trump has been talking about changing libel laws since before he was elected president. ""I'm going to open up our libel laws so when they write purposely negative and horrible and false articles, we can sue them and win lots of money,"" Trump said at a February rally in Fort Worth, Texas. ""We're going to open up those libel laws."" Trump returned to this theme following the release of excerpts from Fear: Trump in the White House, a new book by veteran journalist Bob Woodward that paints Trump and his White House in a negative light. ""Isn’t it a shame that someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost,"" Trump tweeted on Sept. 5 ""Don’t know why Washington politicians don’t change libel laws?"" Isn’t it a shame that someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost. Don’t know why Washington politicians don’t change libel laws? If Trump wants to change libel law, he needs a more accurate understanding of what the current law states. The law does not currently protect people who ""totally make up stories."" (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The broad legal category of ""defamation"" includes both libel, which takes the form of writing, and slander, which takes the form of spoken words. Generally speaking, if a person believes that someone else’s statements have caused injury to their reputation, they can sue, claiming defamation. The law makes a distinction that’s relevant to Trump’s situation: If the person alleging defamation is a public figure, they must clear a higher bar than for ordinary individuals to prove that defamation has occurred. The unanimous 1964 U.S. Supreme Court decision in New York Times vs. Sullivan holds that the First Amendment generally protects even false statements about public officials and public figures. But it does not protect statements made with ""actual malice,"" which means that the publication knew they were false and published the material anyway, or that they were published with reckless disregard to whether the material was true or false. Experts told us Trump’s scenario of someone who would ""totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact"" would be subject to current defamation laws. ""The president's tweet clearly assumes a situation where two things are the case,"" said Leonard M. Niehoff, a University of Michigan law professor. ""First, that the person has ‘totally’ and intentionally ‘made the information up’ — it’s not an instance of a mistake but of deliberate fabrication. And second, that the statement made is one of ‘fact’ and so is capable of being proved true or false, rather than being an opinion or a belief."" Given this scenario, Niehoff said, the law of defamation gives the aggrieved party a claim. ""Even under the highly protective standard of New York Times vs. Sullivan, a public official or figure would have a claim under these circumstances because this meets the test for ‘actual malice,’"" Niehoff said. ""So to the extent that the president is describing the state of the law, he is simply and objectively wrong."" Of course, the plaintiff in Trump’s example would have to do more than just assert their case. They would have to prove it in court. This is a high bar but not an impossible one. ""Casebooks are filled with examples of people who have successfully used libel law to challenge false statements and portrayals in articles, books and movies,"" said David Ardia, co-director of the University of North Carolina Center for Media Law and Policy. In 2003, for instance, Tom Cruise won a $10 million judgment in a defamation case against an ""erotic wrestler"" who claimed he’d had a gay affair with the actor. In 2017, a jury awarded three far less famous plaintiffs with $247 million after it found a highway billboard operated by New Hampshire mortgage broker Michael Gill featured defamatory statements about them. Much more common than outright court victories, however, are defamation cases that lead to a monetary settlement between the parties. This effectively makes defamation law a tool to produce a ""retribution or cost"" against the alleged perpetrator without having to win a case in court. Examples of celebrities who have reached such settlements include actress Katie Holmes and former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura. Alternately, a plaintiff could file a suit under the ""tort of false light,"" said Jane E. Kirtley, a professor of media ethics and law at the University of Minnesota’s Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication. Such lawsuits cover embarrassment from a misleading or untrue implication. Trump’s use of the phrase ""form a picture of a person"" does sound like the way false light claims are often framed, Niehoff said. But if this is what Trump intended, he said, it only makes his tweet doubly wrong, because there would be two potential claims — defamation and false light — that would be available to the aggrieved party, at least in the states in which false light suits are allowed. About the only way a defamer could ""get away with it without retribution or cost"" if the target of the alleged defamation fails to file a lawsuit challenging it, or if they hire a lawyer who isn’t strong enough to win the case. But legal experts don’t consider this to be a significant caveat. ""The system makes ‘retribution’ — or, as we lawyers fondly call it, ‘justice’ — available, but that always comes in the form of an opportunity, not a guarantee,"" Niehoff said. Ironically, Trump himself is currently the defendant in a defamation suit filed by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on his television show, The Apprentice, who has alleged that Trump had groped her. Trump denied Zervos’ allegation on multiple occasions, which prompted her to respond with the defamation suit. ""His brutalizing of her a second time — this time falsely condemning her to the world as a liar for having the temerity to reveal his earlier unwanted sexual groping of her body — directly caused serious injury,"" her attorneys argued in court filings. Given Trump’s legal exposure, Niehoff said, ""perhaps he should be careful what he wishes for"" in his tweets about defamation law. Trump tweeted that ""someone can write an article or book, totally make up stories and form a picture of a person that is literally the exact opposite of the fact, and get away with it without retribution or cost."" This is not accurate. Anyone who alleges defamation from a fabricated and inaccurate account could sue under at least one and possibly two legal doctrines, and if they did, they would have a good chance of prevailing at trial — even a public figure like Trump, who would have to meet a higher legal standard.

"['Elections', 'Missouri', 'Saundra McDowell']","
McDowell claims Missouri Amendment 1 would adjoin distant voting districts
","If November ballot measure Amendment 1 passes, municipalities such as  St. Louis and Joplin could be smushed into one district, according to Saundra McDowell, Republican candidate for state auditor. During an interview on ""The Weekend Report"" radio show, published online Aug. 20, McDowell, who is running against Democratic incumbent Nicole Galloway, said Amendment 1 would require all new voting districts to be 50 percent Republican and 50 percent Democrat. To do that, the auditor's office ""could take one district, St. Louis here, and merge it with a district in southwest Missouri, a Republican district, and they don't even have to touch,"" she said, even adding later in the interview that ""this will happen."" As states nationwide seek solutions for gerrymandering, Missouri is doing the same with Amendment 1, which would put the power of redrawing state voting districts into the hands of a non-partisan expert picked from a list curated by the auditor's office. The amendment also seeks to rid lobbyist gifts from the Missouri General Assembly and to keep legislative records public, among other stipulations. It is authored by Clean Missouri, a bipartisan group that aims to reduce the influence of lobbyists and corporations. It has attracted attacks from many politicians, including McDowell. Given the strikingly different claims from Amendment 1 proponents and McDowell's surprising assertion about non-contiguity, we decided to assess her contention.   The McDowell campaign did not respond to repeated requests for comment, noting that she doesn't intend to take media interviews for approximately 60 days as of Aug. 27. In the statement, McDowell claims that the auditor's office would have overwhelming control over the redistricting process, adding that the auditor’s office ""could literally change the entire demographics of Missouri."" She said earlier in the interview that Democrats back Amendment 1 so that Galloway can bend the maps in favor of her party. Amendment 1 language gives the auditor's office just one role: making a list of potential non-partisan demographers from state residents who apply. From that list, the state Senate's majority and minority leaders would have to agree on one or accept a random lottery after each leader removes a third of the list. After the demographer draws up the maps, state legislative commissions can make any changes to it after holding a public hearing. Benjamin Singer, communications director for Clean Missouri, said there was no language in the amendment specifying which part of the government the demographer works in, such as the auditor's office. The question of whether St. Louis and ""a southwest Missouri Republican district"" could become a district without their borders touching is answered in the amendment, sort of. Section 3 says new districts ""shall be composed of contiguous territory. Areas which meet only at the points of adjoining corners are not contiguous."" Edward Greim, a lawyer who specializes in constitutional and election law, filed a lawsuit in August to remove Amendment 1 from the ballot. The lawsuit will be decided upon by a judge as early as this week. Greim said that on the surface, this language gives more teeth to contiguity than the current law. But Greim said a loophole in the same section of the amendment prioritizes fairer dispersal of Republicans and Democrats in an area over contiguity. The phrase in question is that contiguity is ""subject to the requirements of subdivisions (1)(a) and (1)(b)."" ""Now, they only need to be composed (of contiguous districts) if you have met A and B,"" Greim said. So if A and B can only be met without contiguity, then contiguity becomes moot, Greim said. Ruth Greenwood, a redistricting attorney from Campaign Legal Center, said ""subject to"" simply means one requirement has a lower priority than another. ""It would ultimately be up to the court to interpret the text,"" she said. Do districts need to be half-Republican and half-Democrat? Context is essential to McDowell's statement, as she said that non-contiguity is required because every district has to be close to 50 percent Republican and Democratic.   But the amendment's requirement that any shift in the statewide electorate reflect a substantially proportionate shift in the state legislature would not be met if that was the case. The amendment also requires the map to be drawn based on voting numbers from the sum of all districts. In other words, Greenwood said, the map can't be drawn solely on a district-by-district basis. Why? Because a big goal of the amendment is to reduce the ""efficiency gap"" in votes. The statistic measures the difference in the number of votes that don't contribute to a win. After all, everything above 50 percent is not necessary. This would fight gerrymandering methods, where the goal is to increase the opposition party's so-called ""wasted votes"" while decreasing one party's own. What matters is not how red or blue a certain district is, but how ""efficient"" votes are being translated to representation. With the Clean Missouri model, not every district has to be ""50-50,"" as potential voting maps of other states have demonstrated. Rather, it simply seeks to reduce the disproportionate representation of the party in power. McDowell said that if Amendment 1 is enacted, the auditor's office will necessitate non-contiguous voting districts. Specifically, she said the auditor's office ""could take one district, St. Louis here, and merge it with a district in southwest Missouri, a Republican district, and they don't even have to touch."" Her sentiment is too broad and mostly unfounded. Because the auditor's office does not have complete control over drawing districts, and Amendment 1 is not trying to make every district is evenly split between Republicans and Democrats, McDowell's allegation of non-contiguous voting districts becomes more dubious. Her supposed saving grace — ""subject to the requirements of subdivisions (1)(a) and (1)(b)""— is highly debatable and best left up to legal parsing. We rate the statement Mostly False.","[('Amendment 1 text, from Missouri Secretary of State website, accessed Aug. 25, 2018.', 'https://www.sos.mo.gov/CMSImages/Elections/Petitions/2018-048.pdf'), ('Radio interview of Saundra McDowell on The Weekend\xa0Report, published Aug. 20, 2018.', 'No link'), ('Telephone conversation with Ruth Greenwood, redistricting attorney from\xa0Campaign Legal Center, Aug. 30, 2018.', 'https://971talk.radio.com/media/audio-channel/saundra-mcdowell-weekend-report'), ('Telephone conversation with Edward Greim, attorney, Aug. 27, 2018.', 'No link'), ('Multiple phone conversations with Josh Smith, McDowell campaign representative, between Aug. 27 and Sept. 1, 2018.', 'http://www.campaignlegalcenter.org/15th/'), ('Telephone conversation with Benjamin Singer and Sean Nicholson of\xa0Clean Missouri,\xa0author of Amendment 1, Aug. 27, 2018', 'No link'), ('The Math Behind Gerrymandering and Wasted Votes, Patrick Honner, Quanta Magazine.

Wooten says blocked Medicaid affected half a million North Carolinians and veterans
","For years, Democrats in North Carolina have pushed to expand Medicaid, a move they say would help hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians afford health insurance. JD Wooten, A Democratic candidate for state Senate, added new fuel to the expansion debate when he blasted his opponent, four-term Republican incumbent Sen. Rick Gunn, in a campaign ad. ""My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans,"" Wooten said in a caption posted with the video. We wondered if Wooten -- who is running in North Carolina’s District 24, which includes Alamance County and part of Guilford County -- was correct in his estimates. We decided to take a look. ‘Blocked the expansion’ Medicaid provides health insurance to low-income people. North Carolina has participated in the program since 1970 but remains one of 17 states that has not moved to expand it. Medicaid expansion — an action made possible by the federal Affordable Care Act — would give coverage to folks with household incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty level. As a result, many North Carolinians who do not qualify for the ACA’s health care subsidies or regular Medicaid coverage would be able to escape the so-called coverage gap. Since his election in 2016, Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has battled with conservatives in the state’s Republican-led legislature over the issue. There were signs of a bipartisan agreement when Republicans authored a 2017 bill called ""Carolina Cares,"" but the legislation never got off the ground in committee. But while some state Republicans have worked toward compromise, Gunn was among many co-sponsors of a 2013 bill that rejected the ACA’s optional Medicaid expansion, clarified the state’s intent not to operate a state-run health benefit exchange and determined that Medicaid eligibility decisions would be made by the state rather than the federal government. The bill was adopted by a vote of 74 to 40 in the state House and 31-16 in the state Senate and signed into law by then-Gov. Pat McCrory. Gunn did not respond to multiple requests for comment, but Republican leaders in the legislature have consistently opposed Medicaid expansion, saying North Carolina's share of the rising cost of the program would be too expensive. Senate leader Phil Berger called it a ""budget-busting"" expense, The News & Observer reported in 2017. ‘Half a million people’ The Wooten campaign cited several reports to support the claim that withholding Medicaid expansion was costing half a million North Carolinians health insurance. Among those were articles from the left-leaning North Carolina Justice Center, the pro-expansion Close the Gap NC and the North Carolina Medical Journal, all of which estimated that the expanded benefit would give new coverage to some 500,000 people. Most other reports predicted similar results. The U.S. Census Bureau, for example, estimated in 2016 that there are more than 440,000 North Carolinians who are uninsured and earning less than 138 percent of the federal poverty level. David Anderson, a research associate at Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said the actual impact would likely exceed the Census Bureau’s estimate because additional people who are currently insured on ACA exchanges could be expected to transfer to Medicaid if an expansion bill passed. ""The estimate of 500,000 North Carolina residents would be covered by Medicaid is a solid estimate well within consensus, expert opinion,"" Anderson said. Other experts we consulted agreed. ""It appears that about a half a million people is close in the estimate,"" said Lisa Dubay, senior fellow in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute, a left-leaning, Washington-based think tank. Predictions and estimates vary, but Wooten’s claim does not seem to oversell the impact Medicaid expansion could have. In a 2017 article, North Carolina Health News reported that the number could even exceed 625,000, according to the state’s Medical Care Advising Committee, a collection of health clinic managers, doctors and administrators. Veterans affected  The Wooten campaign did not say how or where it found its estimate for the impact on veterans, but the number may have come from NC Policy Watch, the news arm of the NC Justice Center, which cited a 2013 study from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Urban Institute. According to that study, approximately 23,000 North Carolina veterans would receive Medicaid coverage under an expanded program. Anderson noted, however, that although the estimate resulted from a sound statistical process, it is becoming outdated. Jennifer Haley, a research associate in the Health Policy Center at the Urban Institute who co-authored the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation study, also directed us to a more recent report issued by the Urban Institute in 2016. That report estimated that, of the 25,000 veterans projected to be uninsured in North Carolina in 2017, 2,000 would be eligible for but not receiving Medicaid and another 12,000 would fall into the coverage gap, for a total of approximately 14,000 people. This number is short of Wooten’s 23,000, but Anderson explained that the difference between the two studies’ findings is likely due to sampling error and trend changes. ""The caveat with Medicaid expansion is that current veterans who make between 100 and 138 percent (of the federal poverty level) would be able to switch their insurance to Medicaid or gain coverage,"" Anderson said. ""There are no good numbers for that. I think it is safe to say that the most recent study gives a floor of 14,000."" So Wooten’s estimate may be outdated, but it does not seem unreasonable. And his larger point — that a large number of veterans would gain coverage from Medicaid expansion — holds true. Our ruling In the caption of a video posted to Facebook, Wooten said, ""My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans."" Wooten is mostly correct on the first two charges and close to correct on the third. Gunn co-sponsored a 2013 bill that rejected Medicaid expansion, so even if he was not solely responsible for blocking expansion, he played a role in it. Experts agree this is costing approximately 500,000 North Carolinians the chance at receiving health coverage. That would include many veterans, although the exact number is less clear than Wooten suggested. But given the available research, Wooten’s number seems reasonable. We rate this statement Mostly True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact. The NC Local News Lab Fund and the International Center for Journalists provides support for the project, which shares fact-checks with newsrooms statewide.","[('JD Wooten for NC Senate on Facebook, ""Why I’m Running — Medicaid Expansion,"" Aug. 23, 2018', 'https://www.facebook.com/JDWootenNC/videos/2169507299953822/'), ('The North Carolina Justice Center, ""INFOGRAPHICS: How the Coverage Gap Affects NC Families,"" accessed Aug. 30, 2018', 'No link'), ('Close the Gap NC, ""What is the Coverage Gap,"" accessed Aug. 30, 2018', 'http://www.ncjustice.org/?q=health/infographics-how-coverage-gap-affects-nc-families'), ('The North Carolina Medical Journal, ""The Case for Medicaid Expansion in North Carolina,"" accessed Aug. 30, 2018', 'No link'), ('General Assembly of North Carolina Session 2013, ""No N.C.

Fact-checking Andrew Gillum's claim that he was sued by NRA and gun lobby over Tallahassee ordinance
","Speaking about recent mass shootings in Florida, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum called for the enforcement of ""common sense gun laws"" and touted his own fight against the National Rifle Association. ""I was literally sued, drug through court for two years by the NRA and the gun lobby, all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks,"" Gillum, Tallahassee’s mayor, said in an Aug. 29 interview on MSNBC’s The Last Word with Lawrence O’Donnell. Gillum is competing against Ron DeSantis, a pro-Trump Republican congressman, in the race to become Florida’s next governor. The election is Nov. 6. Gillum is right — he and other Tallahassee elected officials were sued because they did not repeal an ordinance prohibiting the discharge of firearms in public parks. But he left out some context. The NRA supported the lawsuit filed by gun rights advocates, but it was not a party to it. Courts allowed the ordinance to remain on the books, since a 1987 state law effectively declared it ""null and void"" and the ordinance wasn’t being enforced. Two groups advocating for gun rights, Florida Carry, Inc. and the Second Amendment Foundation, filed a lawsuit in May 2014 against the city of Tallahassee, then-Mayor John Marks and several city commissioners, including Gillum, who served on the commission at the time. (He was sworn in as mayor November 2014.) The NRA did not sue. But it filed an amicus brief supporting Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation. ""Mayor Gillum knows the NRA is not suing him, but he also knows he wouldn’t get much attention by crying out that a small Florida group and another from Bellevue, Washington, have taken him to court,"" Marion P. Hammer, former NRA president wrote in an opinion piece published by the Tallahassee Democrat in January 2017. Second Amendment Foundation and Florida Carry said they were suing Tallahassee and its elected officials for ""refusing to repeal ordinances restricting the use of firearms in defiance of Florida’s firearms preemption law."" The lawsuit claimed that the ordinances (one from 1957 and another from 1984, amended in 1988) had been reprinted without being amended, and infringed on the Florida Legislature’s intent to provide uniform firearm laws across the state. A 1987 Florida law gave the state the exclusive power to regulate firearms and ammunition, and deemed ""null and void"" related local ordinances and regulations. The legislature in 2011 doubled down on the law by allowing penalties against local officials who enacted or enforced firearm regulations. The 1957 provision said, ""No person shall discharge any firearms except in areas five acres or larger zoned for agricultural uses."" The ordinance amended in 1988 made it ""unlawful for any person to discharge a firearm in a park or recreational facility owned, managed, maintained, or controlled by the city,"" the lawsuit said. It added that Gillum and other commissioners in February 2014 voted in favor of indefinitely tabling a repeal discussion. The city of Tallahassee, in a filing to dismiss the lawsuit, argued that Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation had ""no clear legal right to compel"" city commissioners to repeal the ordinances and that since the legislature had rendered the ordinances invalid, ""nothing else is required."" Nonetheless, the case moved forward. A circuit court judge, George S. Reynolds, III, ultimately sided with the city, saying that the city’s actions did not enact or cause the ordinances to be enforced. ""While cleaning up the city code so that old city ordinances which are no longer legal, relevant, or enforced are removed may be good public policy, it remains the city’s prerogative – not the plaintiffs, nor this court’s,"" Reynolds wrote in his November 2015 opinion. The groups appealed to the Florida 1st District Court of Appeal. But the appeals court in February 2017 also ruled in favor of the city. While the ordinances ""may still be ‘on the books,’ they are unenforceable and invalid,"" the court’s opinion said. Gillum said that he was sued by the NRA and the gun lobby ""all because in my city we refused to repeal an ordinance which said you couldn’t shoot guns in city parks."" Gillum was among Tallahassee elected officials sued by two gun rights groups for not repealing a decades-old ordinance restricting the use of firearms in city parks. The local ordinance had been deemed null and void by a state law and not been enforced. The NRA supported the groups and filed an amicus brief, but it was not a formal party in the litigation. Other gun rights groups were the plaintiffs. Gillum’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.","[('MSNBC, Gillum: DeSantis campaigning on ‘The Trump Manual’, Aug. 29, 2018', 'https://www.msnbc.com/the-last-word/watch/gillum-desantis-campaigning-on-the-trump-manual-1309472323527?v=railb'), ('Email exchange, Andrew Gillum press team, Geoff Burgan, Aug. 31, 2018', 'No link'), ('Complaint file by Florida Carry and the Second Amendment Foundation against Tallahassee and its elected officials, May 2, 2014', 'https://www.floridacarry.org/images/stories/Tallahassee/Florida_Carry_v._Tally_Complaint.pdf'), ('Florida First District Court of Appeal opinion, Feb. 3, 2017', 'No link'), ('Tallahassee Democrat, Hammer: Mayor Gillum’s attack on the NRA unwise, Jan. 9, 2017', 'https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/files/fl_carry_v._cot_appellate_ruling.pdf'), ('Floridacarry.org, Florida Carry, Inc. and the Second Amendment Foundation joined forces in the lawsuit against the City of Tallahassee for refusing to repeal ordinances restricting the use of firearms in defiance of Florida’s firearms preemption law; Second Amendment Foundation, Florida Carry, Inc. and Second Amendment Foundation v.

Are half of Oregon university students on Pell grants?
","As a member of the Oregon State Board of Higher Education, former Portland city Commissioner Jim Francesconi recently wrote a guest column on the importance of a university degree. He urged more public and private support of low-income students going to college. We’ve already checked one of the statistics Francesconi cited in his column, about the percentage of poor children in Oregon. Now, we turn to an assertion about Pell grants, the federal program for financially needy students. ""Education after high school is the way, but it is out of reach for many children, especially in rural Oregon. Nearly half of Oregon's children are poor. Half of Oregon university students are on Pell Grants. The average student debt is more than $25,000."" We figured this would be a straightforward check: Are half of Oregon university students receiving Pell grants? The Federal Pell Grant Program helps undergraduate students with money awards that don’t have to be paid back. According to the U.S. Department of Education, the maximum award for the 2013-14 school year is $5,645. Nationally, more than 9 million students received Pell aid in 2011-12. Pell grants can be an indication of how well a university fares in educating and graduating students from across the economic spectrum. We assume that Francesconi is speaking of students in the Oregon University System, as he is a board member writing about the importance of making state universities accessible to residents. We’re also thinking that he’s limiting himself even further to students who graduate from Oregon high schools. More on that later. We turned to our trusty ""OUS Fact Book,"" which gives details of Oregon’s seven public universities. There were nearly 85,500 undergraduates counted in fall 2012.There were nearly 28,900 students who received Pell grants in 2012-13. Our calculator tells us that’s 34 percent, not half. We checked with College Insight, affiliated with the Institute for College Access & Success, for a national take. For 2010-11, it says 31 percent of undergraduates at Oregon’s four-year public universities received Pell grants. That’s higher than in Washington, which is at 25 percent, and lower than in California, which reports that roughly 42 percent of undergraduates at public universities received Pell grants. Nationally, the statistic is 34 percent. In any case, 31 percent or 34 percent is not 50 percent. What gives? We turned to the university system, and its data expert Bob Kieran, who is Assistant Vice Chancellor for Institutional Research and Planning at Oregon University System. Kieran said Francesconi is accurate because, in 2010-11, the university system awarded bachelor’s degrees to more than 11,100 Oregonians. More than 5,500 of those graduates had received Pell grant money at some point in college. That’s just about half. ""Half our undergraduates are not necessarily receiving a Pell award in any given term or year, but half of the Oregonians receiving a bachelor’s degree have benefited from a Pell award during their academic program within OUS,"" Kieran wrote in an initial email. Francesconi confirmed using the statistic cited by Kieran to back up his statement. ""Half of students are on Pell Grants during their college years and I will leave it to you and your readers to determine the significance of the difference,"" Francesconi wrote in an email to PolitiFact Oregon. We admit it. We were really confused. To us, that 50 percent of students who graduated in one year relied on Pell grants sometime during college is not the same thing as saying that 50 percent of Oregon university students are on Pell grants at any given time. Those are different measurements. Francesconi’s statement, at this point, was not accurate. The Fact Book numbers didn’t show he was right, and the statistic he relied on did not prove his statement right. We persisted. In a follow-up email, Kieran then explained that the 34 percent Pell grant figure is inaccurate because it’s based on a larger universe of students, including those from abroad or out of state. He said we should focus on Oregon residents since the gist of Francesconi’s op-ed is to encourage ways to help Oregon students thrive in higher education. That number, he said, is this: In fall 2012, nearly 25,000 of nearly 55,000 resident undergraduates enrolled received Pell grants. That’s 45 percent -- which is much closer to 50 percent. We asked Kieran to calculate for previous years. In 2007, 30 percent of resident undergraduates were on Pell grants; in 2010, the figure was 43 percent and in 2011, 45 percent. As you can see, nearing the 50 percent mark is a recent development. A side note here. We don’t doubt Francesconi’s sincerity in urging greater investment in public education. Still, we think it important to get the numbers right when making a point. For example, Francesconi also wrote that the average student graduates with $25,000 in debt. That would only apply to the 59 percent of students who graduate with debt. We know because we checked a similar statement by Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Ore., and another higher education board member pointed out that 41 percent of OUS students graduate with no debt. Now, we return to our regular program. Francesconi said that half of Oregon university students are needy enough to be on Pell grants. This is within the ballpark of accurate if you limit the count to Oregon residents at Oregon’s public universities. And we can accept these qualifiers given the overall thrust of his guest column -- even as we find the original explanation provided by the speaker and university system to be seriously flawed. Last year’s snapshot figures show that 45 percent of Oregon resident undergraduates were on Pell grants, up from 30 percent in 2007. The Oregon University System eventually unearthed statistics to back up Francesconi’s statement, making it accurate but requiring clarification and additional information. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('Jim Francesconi, ""Tapping private resources for public university good: Guest opinion,"" The Oregonian, Aug. 7, 2013', 'http://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/index.ssf/2013/08/tapping_private_resources_for.html'), ('Oregon University System, ""Fact Book 2012,"" January 2013', 'No link'), ('Oregon University System, ""OUS Achievement Compact 2012-13,"" April 2012', 'http://www.ous.edu/sites/default/files/dept/ir/reports/fb2010/2012_Fact_Book.pdf'), ('U.S. Department of Education, ""2011-12 Federal Pell Grant Program End of Year Report,"" January 2013', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact Oregon, ""Is the average debt upon college graduation more than $24,000?""

Deepwater Wind CEO Jeffrey Grybowski says offshore wind power cheaper than solar power in R.I.
","EDITOR’S NOTE:  On Aug. 28, 2013, PolitiFact Rhode Island rated as False a statement by Deepwater Wind CEO Jeffrey Grybowski that offshore wind power is ""significantly less expensive than solar energy."" We based that ruling on a comparison of the estimated price of Deepwater’s planned 1,000 megawatt windfarm with a recent contract price for a solar project in Rhode Island. Deepwater Wind objected to the ruling, pointing to contract prices of several other Rhode Island solar projects. Based on that information and a second review, we have changed our ruling to Mostly True and are providing this new analysis. July 31 was a red letter day for Deepwater Wind, a Providence company that hopes to build the first offshore wind farm in the United States. That was the day Deepwater was announced as the winner of a federal auction to lease space for the farm in a 257-square-mile area of waters off Rhode Island and Massachusetts. (The company plans an initial demonstration project of five turbines off Block Island. The larger project would have more than 100 turbines.) It was in that context that Jeffrey R. Grybowski, chief executive officer of Deepwater Wind, appeared Aug. 4, 2013 on the TV public affairs show ""10 News Conference."" Host Bill Rappleye asked Grybowski how much the electricity generated by the turbines would cost. ""Yes, 13- to 14-cent power [offshore wind energy per kilowatt hour] is probably what we’re talking about, significantly lower than the cost of what we’ve seen for offshore wind to date,"" Grybowski said. ""Also, by the way, significantly less expensive than solar energy."" We wondered whether offshore wind is, in fact, cheaper than solar. We started with the state Division of Public Utilities and Carriers and the Public Utilities Commission, which both have important roles in setting the prices for renewable energy. Deepwater has negotiated with energy distributor National Grid, which is required to buy power from renewable sources, a wholesale price of 24.4 cents per kilowatt hour for the five-turbine demonstration project, steadily ranging up to 46.9 cents per kilowatt hour in the last year of a 20-year contract, according to division officials. The demonstration would have a generating capacity of 30 megawatts -- a measure of peak output over an hour. (A megawatt is 1,000 kilowatts. The average U.S. home uses about 940 kilowatt hours per month, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.) If the demonstration wind farm, called Phase I, works out as planned, Deepwater Wind expects to move forward on plans to build a large-scale wind farm, called Phase II, in the leased federal waters. Phase II would generate up to 1,000 megawatts -- enough, the company says, to power 350,000 homes. In an interview with PolitiFact Rhode Island, Grybowski said his comments on ""10 News Conference"" were about Phase II. He predicted that in the coming years, Deepwater will be able to negotiate with National Grid a wholesale price of 13 cents to 14 cents per kilowatt hour, escalating annually over the life of a contract. To check Grybowski’s claim, we first had to determine the price of offshore wind energy. That’s a challenge because no such project has yet been built in the United States. As proof that his 13- to 14-cent-per-kilowatt-hour estimate is realistic, Grybowski pointed to a formal offer by Deepwater in 2012 to sell Phase II energy in New York state for as low as 10 cents per kwh. The closest point of comparison is in nearby Massachusetts, where the Cape Wind project in Nantucket Sound is under contract with National Grid for a year-one price, adjustable with contingencies, of 18.7 cents per kwh. How do these prices compare with the price of solar locally? The Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, which also has a rate-setting role in renewable energy, provided a list of 18 solar projects that have entered into contracts with National Grid since December 2011. The wholesale prices ranged from 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour to 33 cents, with the largest projects having the lowest prices. Deepwater provided a similar list compiled from National Grid data, showing 21 Rhode Island solar projects, with prices also ranging from 18.5 cents per kilowatt hour to 33 cents. By law in Rhode Island, solar projects enter into contracts with National Grid at a fixed price for 15 years and offshore wind at a price with annual escalators for 20 years. Four of the 21 solar projects on Deepwater’s list have initial prices lower than Deepwater’s Phase I price. All of them would be substantially less expensive than the final Phase I price because of the annual escalator. But let’s look at the Deepwater Phase II project that Grybowski was talking about, and let’s assume that his 13-to-14 cent estimate holds true. That’s cheaper initially than all of the Rhode Island solar projects. Phase II also has an escalating price -- Grybowski said the company expects to obtain a contract of about 20 years with prices escalating about 3 percent a year. The initial Deepwater price would be cheaper than all the solar prices. At year 12, the Deepwater price would surpass the cheapest solar project’s price. After 20 years, the Deepwater price would be about 23 cents -- still cheaper than 19 of the 21 solar projects. It should be noted that comparisons of solar and offshore wind prices in Rhode Island are tricky because of scale. There’s not much room in our crowded, tiny state for the sort of large-scale solar projects that exist in the Southwest, for example. The largest solar project on Deepwater’s list, planned for the former Forbes Street Landfill, in East Providence, would have a capacity of 3.7 megawatts. Fifteen of the 21 are less than 1 megawatt, compared with the 1,000 megawatts of Deepwater’s Phase II. On the national level, the U.S. Energy Information Administration estimates that the most widespread kind of solar power, photovoltaic, has a ""levelized cost"" of 22.4 cents per kilowatt hour, compared with offshore wind at 29.5 cents. ""Levelized cost is often cited as a convenient summary measure of the overall competitiveness of different generating technologies,"" the administration explains on its website. For a large-scale offshore wind project, Grybowski contends that the 29.5-cent estimate is inaccurate, based on faulty methodology. Our ruling Deepwater Wind’s Jeffrey Grybowski said offshore wind power is ""significantly less expensive than solar energy."" Deepwater’s small Phase I demonstration project would, in fact, be more expensive over time than all of the Rhode Island solar projects the company cited. But if Grybowski’s estimated electricity price for the much larger Phase II holds true, its price would ultimately be cheaper than 19 of the 21 solar projects. The gap would be a few cents for the larger solar projects and up to 10 cents for the smallest. Because Grybowski’s claim is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, the judges rule it Mostly True.","[('EIA.gov, ""Levelized Cost of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2013,"" U.S. Energy Information Administration, Jan. 28, 2013, accessed Aug. 19, 2013', 'https://www.eia.gov/forecasts/aeo/electricity_generation.cfm'), ('State of New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, ""In the Matter of the Petition of Fishermen’s Atlantic City Wind Farm LLC,"" July 19, 2013, accessed Aug. 21, 2013', 'No link'), ('Interview and email, Thomas F.

Perry claim about dollars leaving Missouri for Texas oversimplifies IRS data
","Do dollars slip from state to state? Texas Gov. Rick Perry suggested as much in a radio ad aired in Missouri as he framed his case for businesses there to slip away to Texas. In the ad, posted online Aug. 21, 2013, Perry said: ""Every year, more than $40 million are leaving Missouri for the Lone Star State."" (He failed to say, ""'Show Me' the money."") To our inquiry, Perry spokesman Josh Havens said the $40 million traces to an online application created by Travis H. Brown, CEO of a St. Louis public affairs and advocacy firm and author of the 2013 book,""How Money Walks."" Havens said clicking on Missouri on the app shows that between 1992 and 2010, more than $791 million ""was lost to the state of Texas. That equates to more than $40 million each year."" We confirmed his figures on the ""Wealth Migration"" app, which indicates that Missouri lost an average of $1.38 billion in adjusted gross income from 1992 through 2010--with the net loss to Texas alone totaling $791.3 million. As defined by the Internal Revenue Service, adjusted gross income is a person’s gross income minus adjustments. ""For most people,"" according to the app, adjusted gross income ""is the starting point in calculating their taxable income"" for federal tax purposes. At a glance, then, Perry's math seems to work. But is it accurate to say all those dollars annually leave Missouri for Texas? We failed to connect with Brown, but an analyst with the Washington, D.C.-based Tax Foundation, which researches state and federal tax policy, told us the IRS annually makes available its data tallying changes in adjusted gross income across the country and state to state--also taking into account how many taxpayers have moved from one state to another since the previous year’s filings. For instance, the foundation’s Nick Kasprak said by phone, if a taxpayer in Missouri had adjusted gross income of $30,000 one year and then the next year filed a return from Texas showing $65,000 in such income, the IRS would record that as $30,000 moving to Texas--basing that on the adjusted gross income reported in Missouri in the first tax year. A foundation web page breaks down such IRS data for 1993 through 2010, the latest year of available data. Adjusted for inflation, according to the foundation, Texas netted $862 million in adjusted gross income from Missouri over the 17 years, or nearly $51 million a year on average. By email, Kasprak told us the net difference in raw dollars over the 17 years was $710 million, or an annual average of $42 million. This net shift in Texas’s favor exceeded $40 million in 11 of the 17 years, including every year from 2006 through 2010, as shown on a chart we generated. The year 2005 was the latest one in which there was less than a $40 million difference, according to the chart. The low point:  In 2001, the difference was less than $7.4 million.  Source: Web interactive, ""State to State Migration Data,"" the Tax Foundation (accessed Aug. 29, 2013) Per Perry’s statement, Kasprak said it would be helpful to clarify that the cited adjusted gross income figures refer to how much money was made by residents of Texas in their previous year living in Missouri. That is not the same, he said, as saying that those exact earnings moved to Texas. ""It’s not as if these people are literally carrying sacks of money over the border,"" Kasprak said. ""The only thing that is literally true is that if you add up all income of people who moved from Missouri to Texas versus people who moved from Texas to Missouri, this is the net difference"" in the tax year prior to their moves. Another expert, Art Hall, director of the Center for Applied Economics at the University of Kansas, agreed by phone that Perry’s statement reflects only what individuals earned in the state they departed, either Missouri or Texas. ""We don’t know if they got a wage increase or wage cut when they moved to Texas or vice versa,"" Hall said. Regardless, Hall said he considers Perry’s statement in line with the IRS data as adjusted for inflation by the foundation. Our ruling Perry said: ""Every year, more than $40 million are leaving Missouri for the Lone Star State."" That assessment ties to IRS data on adjusted gross income for 1992 through 2010, but the results are more complex and admittedly clunky than this claim acknowledges. That is, Missouri residents who moved to Texas through those years earned more the year before they moved than all income-tax-filing Texas residents who moved to Missouri in those years.   Still, adjusted for inflation, the annual difference averages about $50 million--more than Perry’s unadjusted figure. Then again, this did not hold for every year. In six years--most recently 2005--there was less than a $40 million difference.

Energy Secretary Moniz says U.S. is halfway to greenhouse gas reduction goal; natural gas is key
","When President Barack Obama took office in 2009, he set a goal of cutting greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent by 2020 if all other major economies pledged to limit their emissions, too. Improvements would be tallied against how much of those gases the United States put into the atmosphere in 2005, the year the global climate change treaty known as the Kyoto Protocol was supposed to take effect. The White House would have liked it if Congress had passed a cap-and-trade bill that in theory would create strong market pressures to reduce the release of carbon into the air. That never happened, but two major changes gave the president a shot at making serious headway toward his target. Energy consumption cratered when the economy collapsed and, as you would expect, lower energy use means lower emissions. On the more positive side of the ledger, the surge in natural gas production also helped the country move toward Obama’s goal, although not without concern over environmental side effects. In a question-and-answer session on climate change at Columbia University on Aug. 26, 2013, Energy Secretary Ernest Moniz highlighted the impact of natural gas on emissions. ""In these last years, the natural gas revolution, shall we say, has been a major contributor to reducing carbon emissions,"" Moniz said. ""The president has a goal, as I mentioned, of 17 percent by 2020. We are about halfway there, and about half of that is because of the substitution of natural gas for coal in the power sector, essentially driven by market forces."" We pay attention to the president’s promises and track how well he delivers the goods on the Obameter. But we also thought it would be worth digging into Moniz’s claim. Department of Energy’s focus on carbon dioxide The Energy Department, predictably, looks at the way energy use contributes to greenhouse gas emissions, and in particular, it tracks the dominant greenhouse gas, carbon dioxide. The department’s Energy Information Administration recently published the numbers for 2012, and the details surprised many people. The update reported that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions in 2012 were the lowest since 1994. Compared to 2005, those emissions had fallen by 11.8 percent. That is much more than halfway toward the president’s goal of 17 percent. The update also said the biggest drop was due to the declining use of coal to produce electricity. ""Low natural gas prices led to competition between natural gas — and coal-fired electric power generators,"" the authors wrote. ""Lower natural gas prices resulted in reduced levels of coal generation, and increased natural gas generation."" And to produce the same amount of energy, natural gas puts less carbon dioxide into the air than coal does. The most detailed data is only as recent as 2011, but the shift from coal to natural gas is clear. In terms of power generation, between 2005 and 2011, use of coal fell from 50 percent to 42 percent while the use of natural gas rose from 19 percent to 25 percent. This isn't bulletproof evidence of causation, but it strongly suggests that the switch from coal to natural gas has played a role in reducing carbon dioxide emissions. Greenhouse gases —  more than carbon dioxide If the only molecule to worry about were carbon dioxide, Moniz would have been totally right, but many compounds contribute to climate change. Obama pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent, not just carbon dioxide. The Environmental Protection Agency’s latest report looks at all the relevant gases, some of which are thousands of times more potent in their climate change impact than carbon dioxide. The EPA’s tally also includes activities other than energy production that put gases into the atmosphere. The agency’s figures show that from 2005 to 2011, emissions fell by 7 percent. Measured against the goal of 17 percent, the country has more than halfway to go. It’s roughly at the 40 percent mark. It is possible that when the 2012 numbers are in, the rate of progress will have shot up. The Department of Energy reported a relatively dramatic decline in the release of carbon dioxide in 2012. The EPA’s next report is planned for April 2014. We should note that a separate report from Moniz’s agency gives cause for concern. The Energy Information Administration projects that energy-related carbon dioxide emissions will start to creep up in 2018. By 2020, analysts predict they will show only a 9 percent reduction from 2005 levels. Our ruling Moniz said the country is ""about halfway"" toward the president’s goal of a 17 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 2005 levels. In terms of carbon dioxide, Moniz is correct, but when looking at all greenhouse gases, data from the EPA suggests the country has a little more progress to make. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz,\xa0Speech at Columbia University, Aug 26, 2013', 'http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/Downloads/ghgemissions/US-GHG-Inventory-2013-Chapter-2-Trends.pdf'), ('Environmental Protection Agency, Trends in greenhouse gas emissions, 2013', 'No link'), ('Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, U.S. greenhouse gas emissions at 18-year low, Feb. 7, 2013', 'http://spectrum.ieee.org/energywise/energy/environment/us-greenhouse-gas-emissions-at-eighteenyear-low'), ('Business Council for Sustainable Energy, Sustainable energy in America 2013 factbook, 2013', 'No link'), ('White House, Factsheet: President Obama’s climate action plan, June 25, 2013', 'http://www.bcse.org/sustainableenergyfactbook.html'), ('White House, The President’s climate action plan, June 2013', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, Obama tries the kitchen-sink approach to global warming, June 25, 2013', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/06/25/fact-sheet-president-obama-s-climate-action-plan'), ('U.S. Energy Information Administration, AEO early release overview, Dec. 5, 2012', 'No link'), ('U.S. Department of Energy, Emissions of greenhouse gases in the United States 2005, Nov., 2006', 'https://www.whitehouse.gov/sites/default/files/image/president27sclimateactionplan.pdf'), ('Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. greenhouse gas inventory report, 1990-2011', 'No link'), ('U.S. Energy Information Administration, Energy-related carbon dioxide emissions declined in 2012, April 5, 2013', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/06/25/obama-tries-the-kitchen-sink-approach-to-global-warming/'), ('PolitiFact, The Obameter: Create cap and trade system with interim goals to reduce global warming, Nov. 8, 2010', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/aug/30/ernest-moniz/energy-secretary-moniz-says-us-halfway-greenhouse-/

Missouri governor nails comparison of credit ratings of Missouri and Texas
","Responding to an ad blitz in which Texas Gov. Rick Perry urged Missouri businesses to move to the booming Lone Star State, Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon suggested that taxes are lower in his state and that students fare better. Nixon, a Democrat, also singled out credit worthiness in the radio spot we noticed online Aug. 27, 2013. Unlike Texas, Nixon said, ""Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating."" Three days earlier, he posted a similar claim on a Twitter list of ways he ranks the Show-Me State as ""#betterthantx."" His credit claim snagged our attention. A chart posted online by the California state treasurer lists state general-obligation bond ratings by three rating agencies. We noticed that Missouri and Texas both earned the highest, AAA rating from both Fitch Ratings and Moody’s Investors Service. But Standard & Poor’s gave Missouri a  AAA rating and Texas a rating of AA+, which is its rating immediately below AAA. Via emails from spokespersons for each of those rating services, we confirmed those ratings for both states--and we inquired into the differences. By phone, New York-based Moody’s spokesman David Jacobson told us that both states have long been stable borrowers, though Missouri has had its Moody’s AAA rating longer--since at least 1972, Jacobson said. In contrast, he said, Moody’s lowered its rating for Texas general obligation debt from AAA to AA in 1987. That year, Texas faced a recession that drove down state revenues. In 2010, Jacobson said, Moody’s recalibrated its methodology for rating state debt; Texas regained a AAA rating. A Standard & Poor’s spokesman, Olayinka Fadahunsi, emailed us a Nov. 20, 2012, report by the firm stating it had assigned its AA+ rating to general-obligation bonds issued by the Texas Transportation Commission. The report credited the Texas economy with being diverse and strong and likely to continue to generate additional jobs. Also, it said, state government had strong cash-management practices and low overall debt and retirement liabilities. On the other hand, it expressed concern at the state’s ""budgetary pressures, which are primarily related to the growing proportion of school revenues Texas is required to fund, as well as insufficient new sources of recurring dedicated tax revenues to support the increased funding."" The report also cited ""increasing spending pressure from public assistance payments, including Medicaid,"" plus uncertainty about how the Obamacare law might affect the state’s health-care expenditures. ""Based on the analytic factors we evaluate for states, on a four-point scale in which '1' is the strongest, we have assigned Texas an overall score of '1.8,"" the report said. We asked Fadahunsi to discuss the distinction between the firm’s AA+ and AAA ratings. By email, he said that ""there is no one precise financial distinction."" The firm’s general debt ratings’ methodology, as published Jan. 3, 2011, states that it develops a state’s credit rating by judging conditions across factors including the government’s framework; financial management; economy; budgetary performance; and debt/liability profile. ""We assess each of these factors utilizing various metrics that we score on a scale from 1 (strongest) to 4 (weakest),"" the methodology states. ""For each metric there may be several indicators we evaluate to develop the metric score. We score each indicator individually on the same scale and average the indicators' scores to develop the overall score for the metric. We average the metrics for each factor to develop a composite score for each. The scores for the five factors are combined and averaged with equal weighting to arrive at an overall score which is then translated to an indicative credit level."" The report says an overall score of 1 to 1.5 is needed to draw the AAA rating. Separately, R.J. DeSilva, spokesman for the Texas state comptroller’s office, pointed us to a December 2012, report by the Texas Bond Review Board which includes a chart indicating that as of August 2012, Missouri was among seven states with AAA GO debt ratings from the three major rating services. The other ""perfects"" were: Delaware, Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia. Finally we asked Robert Coalter, executive director of the Texas Public Finance Authority, which issues bonds for the acquisition or construction of state buildings, to speak to any financial costs to Texas from not having Missouri’s three AAA ratings. Coalter said by phone that the effect is minimal, adding that any entity that issues bonds--including state agencies--sometimes obtain ratings from only one or two of the rating services. Also, he said, investment firms conduct their own research before committing to bonds. Coalter said the ratings of Texas debt are outstanding. ""Our debt is considered to be top quality."" Put another way, might the Missouri governor’s statement be real-world meaningless? ""I do not believe it’s significant,"" Coalter replied. He said the claim sounded like comparing one student scoring 100 on a test with another scoring 99. Our ruling Nixon said that unlike Texas, Missouri has a perfect AAA credit rating. That’s correct, though Texas is close; two major services rate the bigger state’s GO debt AAA, one rates it AA+, which is its next-highest rating. We rate this claim as True. ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.

Nikki Haley says South Carolina has had fastest growth in the Southeast
","During an event to launch her bid for a second term, South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley touted her state’s economic renaissance. Haley is facing a tough re-election fight despite being a Republican in a solidly Republican state, so convincing voters that the state’s economy is improving a key part of her re-election argument. ""We have the fastest-growing economy in the Southeast and we’re not slowing down,"" Haley said at the Aug. 26, 2013, event, according to the Washington Post. ""If you think what we did in the first two and a half years was great, wait until you see what we do next."" We wondered whether Haley is correct that South Carolina has ""the fastest-growing economy in the Southeast."" Looking at the region’s economic growth The hard part about checking Haley’s claim isn’t determining how fast her state and others grew -- it’s determining what counts as ""the Southeast."" The Bureau of Economic Analysis, the part of the U.S. Commerce Department that tabulates state-level economic statistics, counts 12 states in its southeastern region. They are listed in the following chart, along with the inflation-adjusted growth in state gross domestic product between 2010, the last full year before Haley took office, and 2012, the last full year during her tenure so far. We chose this statistic because several economists said it was the best one to use in evaluating her claim.   State Inflation-adjusted state GDP, percentage increase, 2012 over 2010 Alabama + 2.2 percent Arkansas + 2.0 percent Florida + 3.4 percent Georgia + 4.2 percent Kentucky + 3.4 percent Louisiana - 1.2 percent Mississippi + 1.2 percent North Carolina + 3.2 percent South Carolina + 5.0 percent Tennessee + 5.8 percent Virginia + 2.2 percent West Virginia + 5.2 percent   So by this measure, South Carolina is close to the top, but not No. 1 -- it trails both Tennessee and West Virginia. But determining what counts as a southeastern state is more art than science. Historically and culturally, Tennessee and West Virginia could just as easily be categorized as Appalachian. In fact, other federal agencies, including the Fish and Wildlife Service and the Environmental Protection Agency, do not count West Virginia as a southeastern state, and the Library of Congress’ guide to American regions doesn’t include a ""southeastern"" region at all. Given the fuzziness of the concept of ""southeastern,"" we are prepared to give Haley some leeway in determining a definition. Under one definition we find plausible -- former Confederate states that also have a coastline, which would exclude Arkansas, Kentucky, Tennessee and West Virginia -- Haley’s claim would be correct. One additional issue: When we check a claim in which the speaker either takes credit or casts blame on an elected official, we try to factor in whether that personal credit or blame is deserved. In this case, Haley wasn’t explicitly saying that she was responsible for South Carolina’s region-topping ranking, but it did come during an event in which she sought a second term, based in part on the state’s economic health. Bill Seyfried, a professor of economics at Rollins College in Winter Park, Fla., said that some of South Carolina’s growth was due to the national manufacturing rebound in 2011 and 2012. ""Being a manufacturing-oriented state when manufacturing is growing helped,"" Seyfried said. Sean Snaith, director of the University of Central Florida’s Institute for Economic Competitiveness said that, in general, ""politicians receive more blame and credit for the economy than is often justifiable, and policy tools at the state level are of a much smaller caliber than those wielded at the national level."" That said, Snaith said he thought Haley’s statement was reasonably solid. Compared to other economic claims by politicians, he said, Haley’s is ""one of the more straightforward."" Our ruling Haley said South Carolina has ""the fastest-growing economy in the Southeast."" Since she took office, South Carolina had the third-highest growth rate among the 12 states that constitute the broadest definition of ""southeastern."" But in a geographically tighter group of eight states, South Carolina does rank first. On balance, we rate her statement Mostly True.","[('Washington Post, ""South Carolina Gov.

Broun's education salaries remark mostly on target
","Georgia congressman and U.S. Senate candidate Paul Broun has been a loud voice in the push to reduce government control of education policy. He has criticized the federal Education Department as being a bloated bureaucracy with excessive spending and salaries. In this vein, Broun and other Republican members of the House narrowly approved the Student Success Act, aimed at lessening the federal government’s power to set national education standards. The bill would reverse many of the provisions of the 2002 No Child Left Behind law. After the vote, Broun touted the approval of his amendment to the bill, requiring more DOE transparency on jobs and salaries. ""While fat-cat bureaucrats at the (U.S.) Department of Education are getting paid an average salary of $102,000 a year, teachers in Georgia are getting paid half of that,"" Broun said in a press release. ""My amendment would hold the Department of Education accountable for their costly salaries, and force the government to take a closer look at how scarce education dollars ought to be spent."" Broun used a similar phrase the day before when announcing House approval of his amendment. And again last week during a campaign event in Marietta: ""Those fat-cat bureaucrats that have never taught a child to read have an average salary across the department of over $101,000 a year,"" Broun said. PolitiFact knows that teachers work hard for their money. But was Broun correct that a teacher’s Peach State pay was half that of federal education workers? We decided to hit the books and find out. The average Georgia public school teacher’s salary for the 2012-2013 school year was $52,956.27, according to Matt Cardoza, spokesman for the state Department of Education. For the federal salary figure, Broun used information from the Heritage Foundation, a Washington-based conservative think tank, along with a database of federal employees’ salaries, his spokeswoman told us. For 2011, the latest year of information Broun referenced, there were 4,620 employees listed in the database for the federal Education Department. The Heritage Foundation’s ""The Foundry"" blog featured a story about the U.S. DOE in 2010 and cited the department’s average employee salary -- not including executive salaries -- of $103,000 for that year. The majority of federal civilian, white-collar employees are classified and paid on the General Schedule (GS), according to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management. The GS pay schedule has 15 grades and 10 steps in each grade. Pay varies by geographic location. GS grades 8-12 are considered midlevel positions. We contacted the Heritage Foundation for background on its reported 2010 salary figure. Lindsey Burke, an education fellow at the organization, provided us with the DOE’s salaries and expenses overview chart for full-time workers. The organization considered the employees at the GS15 level downward, but did not include any executive-level salaries. They then used the government’s standard salary table to determine the pay for each of those levels and averaged those figures to ultimately produce the average employee annual salary. The $103,000 figure is also listed on the DOE overview chart as the average, nonexecutive employee salary for the 2010 budget. A spokesman for the U.S. DOE provided us the same Salaries and Expenses overview table, this time from the fiscal 2014 budget request. The department lists the average employee level as GS12 for the fiscal years 2012-2014. For those years, the average, nonexecutive employee salary was $103,773; $104,198 and $105,020. In looking at these figures, it is important to consider other variables that influence the salary figures. The Bureau of Economic Analysis notes that the skill and education levels for federal jobs tend to be higher because of the job requirements in the federal government. The BEA also noted in recent years that the federal government is hiring more highly skilled workers who tend to make more money. Many of the lower-paid positions have been contracted out to the private sector. It is also important to consider the high cost of living in the Washington area. The cost of all basic necessities is higher in the Washington area than in Atlanta, one of Georgia’s largest and most expensive cities. Groceries are 10 percent more; utilities, 11 percent more; transportation, 6 percent more; and the most expensive item, housing, is 170 percent more expensive in D.C. than in Atlanta, according to the CNN Money cost of living calculator, one of many that makes city comparisons. So does Broun’s claim get a passing grade? Broun said that Georgia teachers make half of what average federal Education Department employees make. On just the numbers, he is very close to accurate. But Broun fails to take into account the high education and experience level that federal employees at this level typically possess, as well as the high cost of living in the Washington, D.C., area versus residing in Georgia. Broun’s statement is accurate but needs some clarification. We rate his claim Mostly True.","[('U.S. Rep.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Scott Walker']","
Walker: Study says health law will raise premiums in Wisconsin exchanges 82 percent
","The new health care law faces tough sledding in many states controlled by Republicans. Wisconsin is a good example, There, Republican Gov. Scott Walker has opposed opening a state-run online site called an exchange where individuals and families can shop for health insurance. Walker left that to Washington to operate. In explaining his reasons, Walker said on Fox News, ""there's the practical issue of what it means for people who may or may not want to be a part of the exchange."" He claimed the rates would skyrocket. Citing a report from the Society of Actuaries, Walker said in Wisconsin, there would be ""an 82 percent increase in individual premiums over the next couple years under Obamacare."" As it turns out, the Society of Actuaries told us that a report it released in March is often misinterpreted by politicians and the media alike. We thought it worthwhile to clarify what the report does and doesn’t say. We contacted Walker’s office to make sure that we were looking at the same document. Spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster referred us to the March study and said the governor ""misspoke"" slightly. The actual number in the report is 80 percent, which is very close to what Walker said. More fundamental is what the 80 percent figure describes. The study The study’s goal was to give policymakers a sense of what it would mean when millions of Americans who currently lack insurance joined the pool of the insured. It aimed to predict how much health care these new people would require. That’s an exercise of looking partly at their health and partly at their behavior.  If as a group, they are a little sicker than the current group, then the average cost of care would rise. If they are healthier, the average cost of care would fall. Even if there were no difference, the cost of care might rise simply because they might use more services when they become more affordable. Importantly, the study dealt only with that part of the insurance market where families and individuals buy policies on their own rather than through an employer. It said nothing about what would happen with employer-provided insurance, which covers more than 80 percent of the population under 65 years old. The technical name for the slice of the market the study examined is ‘non-group’. The report’s authors estimated that the new law would bring a major cut in the number of the uninsured. Nationally, the percentage would fall from 16.6 percent of Americans down to about 6.8 percent. That result would play itself out over several years. The report aimed to paint a picture of the insurance market in approximately 2017 under two circumstances: if every state expanded Medicaid and if no state expanded Medicaid. The key finding, and the one that drove Walker’s comment, was that under the Affordable Care Act, with full expansion of Medicaid, the cost of medical claims would go up 80 percent in the non-group market in Wisconsin. There is enormous variability across the country. Nationally, the number was 32 percent. Claims are the single largest driver of premiums. That said, the report emphasized again and again that it was not estimating what would happen to premiums. The authors wrote, ""Note that the ACA’s affect on premium is not modeled in this research; rather, long-term relative claims cost is modeled. Many aspects of the ACA will affect premiums, including changing benefit designs, new taxes and assessments, federal risk mitigation programs, minimum loss ratio rules, rate review rules, and premium subsidies."" We spoke with David Tuomala, director of actuarial consulting for the Lewin Group, one of the organizations commissioned by the Society of Actuaries to do the analysis. The Lewin Group is owned by UnitedHealth Group, a holding company that includes a large insurer of the same name. Tuomala said the 80 percent figure for Wisconsin was their best estimate for the total claims for service in the total non-group market. Three factors drove the projected increase. The newly insured people would need more care because they would tend to be sicker than the current group. The insurance plans they would buy would be fairly generous. And people with insurance tend to use more services once they become more affordable. Tuomala said many steps lie between claims and premiums. As noted in the report, many people will be eligible for premium subsidies that will reduce the prices they pay. Those subsidies will be hefty, especially for families making about $95,000 or less. According to a government estimate, about half of the people in the exchanges will receive some level of subsidy. That would represent a large share of the group the actuaries focused on. They predicted that 85 percent of the total non-group market in Wisconsin would get policies offered on the exchange. The exchanges are expected to create competition and lower prices, with insurance companies setting prices strategically to gain market share. Still, ""ultimately, claims will be reflected in the premium,"" Tuomala said. Uncertainties ahead Making accurate predictions is challenging. The higher cost estimate for Wisconsin assumed the state would expand Medicaid, something it doesn’t plan to do. That difference however has little impact on the cost of claims. Importantly, other projections by different organizations come up with different results. For example, the Congressional Budget Office predicted premium increases of 10 to 13 percent in the non-group market. Its methods and assumptions were different from the actuaries’ report. Whether this report’s projection turns out right depends largely on who actually signs up for coverage. ""This is the great unknown,"" said Gerard Anderson, director of the Center for Hospital Finance and Management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. ""In the initial years, 7 million people are expected to sign up. The mix of that 7 million will be absolutely critical."" Interestingly, while the actuarial study predicts a large rise in the cost of claims in the non-group market, it sees a modest increase in overall health care spending of just 2 percent. A major reason goes back to the reality that the non-group market is a smaller slice of the total marketplace. Since most people with insurance get it through their employers, there would be little change in the total demand for health care, along with little change in premiums. Our ruling Walker said the study by the Society of Actuaries projected an 82 percent increase in premiums over time. The actual figure was 80 percent, and the report explicitly did not try to predict premiums. What it looked at was the cost of claims in the non-group market, which pertains to less than 20 percent of people with private insurance. Higher costs for insurers typically mean higher premiums for consumers, but there are many uncertainties. When most people hear the word ""premiums,"" they think of the bill they will get, and that is not what the report attempted to describe. Walker was reasonably close in relaying the strong upward pressure on costs, but he mischaracterized that as a change in actual premiums, and he ignored the significant subsidies that will cushion the impact of those cost increases for about half of the people who buy insurance on their own.

Mike Huckabee says if you cut out just four states, U.S. gun-homicide rate drops to Belgium's level
","In a recent Facebook post, former Arkansas Republican Gov. Mike Huckabee used an unusual computation to play down the extent of firearm-related homicides in the United States. ""America’s gun-related homicide rate is nearly 20 times that of other high-income nations,"" Huckabee said in the Aug. 20 post. ""But it would be about the same as Belgium’s if you left out California, Illinois, D.C. and New Jersey: places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S."" For us, this reminded us of the time one of our sources, in a fact-check about a federal budget claim, joked that ""I can meet my weight loss goals if I don't count my butt!"" Beyond Huckabee’s curious formula, though, we wondered: Is he right? Huckabee did not respond to an inquiry for this story placed through his website. We did find that variations of this claim had made the rounds on conservative blogs in the weeks before Huckabee authored his post. Let’s take a look at both ends of this claim. The United States For the U.S. part of the claim, we looked at FBI statistics, which break down data for firearm-related homicides for the nation as a whole as well as by state. Here’s a summary for 2010.   State Firearm-related homicides Population Rate of firearm-related homicides per 100,000 population California 1,257 37,338,198 3.36 District of Columbia 99 604,912 16.36 Illinois 364 12,841,980 2.83 New Jersey 246 8,799,593 2.79 Four states above 1,966 59,584,684 3.29 U.S. total 8,874 309,330,219 2.87 U.S. minus four states cited by Huckabee 6,908 249,745,535 2.77   So, removing the four states from the equation, as Huckabee did, doesn’t really budge the firearm-related homicide rate for the nation as a whole. Also, it’s worth noting that the three states Huckabee cited are not among the states with the highest rates of firearm-related deaths. (Washington, D.C., is, but it is an exception because it isn’t a state, but rather a city without suburbs or rural areas.) Several states have firearm-related death rates above 4 per 100,000, including one with strict gun laws (Maryland) but others in which Second Amendment protections are strong (Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri and South Carolina). Belgium The most recent figures we could find for Belgium are included in an international data comparison published by the United Nations in 2011. In 2004, Belgium reported a firearm-related homicide rate of 0.7 per 100,000, which is well below both the United States as a whole and the U.S.-minus-Huckabee’s-four-states figure. Of course, the data for Belgium is older than the data we used for the United States. However, according to the U.N. compilation, more recent figures for other western European countries show rates even lower than Belgium’s. In 2009 and 2010, the only European countries to post a rate higher than 0.4 per 100,000 were Croatia, Finland, Macedonia, Portugal and Serbia. Every other European nation that reported data during that period was below that threshold. (The Washington Post has published this chart, based on the U.N. data, that compares the advanced industrialized nations by their firearm-related death rate; it shows the U.S. with a much higher rate than any such nation except for Mexico.) So Huckabee’s comparison isn’t even close. Our ruling Huckabee said that ""America’s gun-related homicide rate … would be about the same as Belgium’s if you left out California, Illinois, D.C. and New Jersey, places with some of the strictest gun control laws in the U.S."" Not only is this a strange way to analyze the numbers, but it’s not even correct on its own terms. Even after subtracting these four supposedly high-crime jurisdictions, the firearm-related homicide rate in the United States is still about four times higher than the rate in Belgium and the rest of Europe. We rate the claim Pants on Fire.","[('Mike Huckabee, Facebook post, Aug. 20, 2013', 'https://www.facebook.com/mikehuckabee/posts/10151608960017869'), ('FBI, ""Crime in the United States: Data Table 8, Murder Victims by Weapon, 2007–2011,"" accessed Aug. 28, 2013', 'No link'), ('FBI, ""Crime in the United States: Table 20, Murder by State, Types of Weapons, 2010,"" accessed Aug. 28, 2013', 'https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/tables/expanded-homicide-data-table-8'), ('FBI, ""Crime in the United States: Table 4, Crime in the United States by Region, Geographic Division, and State, 2010–2011,"" accessed Aug. 28, 2013', 'No link'), ('Washington Post, ""Chart: The U.S. has far more gun-related killings than any other developed country,"" Dec. 14, 2012', 'https://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2010/crime-in-the-u.s.-2010/tables/10tbl20.xls'), ('United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, 2011 Global Study on Homicide (homicides by firearm data), accessed Aug. 28, 2013', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/aug/29/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-if-you-cut-out-high-gun-homicid/

Sen. Ron Johnson voted for ""unlimited carbon pollution,"" environmental group says
","On Aug. 14, 2013 -- more than three years before U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson could face re-election -- a national environmental group hit him with an attack ad. The first-term Wisconsin Republican responded by using the TV spot to solicit political contributions. We didn’t think we’d have to go into campaign mode yet for the 2016 elections. But we’re game. In the ad, the League of Conservation Voters alleges that Johnson ""has taken more than $100,000 from oil and gas and voted to let them keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air."" Johnson has received $109,550 from oil and gas interests since his campaign for the 2010 election, according to the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks campaign contributions. So that is not really in dispute. Let’s see if he voted in favor of unlimited carbon pollution. Getting our bearings To be clear on terminology, we'll start with four points. 1. Global warming: The world’s leading science academies have long warned that the planet is warming. The pace has slowed in the past 15 years, although 2000 through 2009 was the warmest decade on record, according to NASA. In August 2013 the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, an international panel of scientists, reiterated the role of human beings, saying in a draft report the odds are at least 95 percent that humans are the main cause of the warming in recent decades. 2. Greenhouse gases: The main human-caused producer of global warming is the emission of greenhouse gases, which trap the Earth's heat. 3. Carbon dioxide: Carbon dioxide makes up 84 percent of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which has determined that greenhouse gases are a threat to humans. 4. Carbon pollution: Carbon dioxide -- or carbon pollution, the term used in the ad -- comes largely from burning fossil fuels such as coal, oil and natural gas. Like Johnson, many congressional Republicans elected in 2010 have expressed doubt about the science of global warming and opposed regulation of climate-altering gases. The ad’s evidence The Washington, D.C.-based League of Conservation Voters is ""a liberal-leaning organization that raises money primarily in support of environmentally friendly public policy,"" according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In the 2011-2012 election cycle, the five candidates who received the most money from the league -- Wisconsin U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin among them -- all were Democrats. To back its claim against Johnson, the League of Conservation Voters cited three Senate votes, each an amendment to a bill; one was in 2011 and two were on the same day in 2013. Two of the votes were noted in the ad and the third was cited by the league as additional evidence. 1. EPA regulations, April 6, 2011 Johnson voted for a failed amendment to an unrelated small-business bill. The amendment would have prohibited the EPA from regulating greenhouse gas emissions and repealed the agency’s scientific finding that carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases are endangering human health and the environment. So, under Johnson’s vote, the EPA couldn’t regulate any carbon emissions, including those emitted in the extraction and refining of oil, or by gasoline-burning vehicles. 2. Global warming, March 22, 2013 Johnson voted for a failed amendment to the 2014 federal budget bill. The amendment would have prohibited ""further greenhouse gas regulations for the purposes of addressing climate change,"" which includes global warming. Like the earlier vote, Johnson supported the status quo: no federal limits on emissions of carbon dioxide, or carbon pollution, whether by oil and gas companies or other energy producers. 3. Carbon emissions, March 22, 2013 Johnson voted for another amendment to the budget to require a vote of 60 senators in order to enact a new federal tax or fee on carbon emissions.The amendment passed. This measure doesn’t regulate carbon emissions, per se, but does make it more difficult to tax emissions. Such a tax, arguably, could lead to less production of energy that results in carbon emissions. For our purposes, the third vote really isn’t necessary in evaluating the claim against Johnson. The intent of the other two votes is clear. Johnson spokeswoman Melinda Whitemarsh Schnell told us the three votes sought to stop President Barack Obama’s administration ""from passing regulations that Congress had earlier refused to enact."" She also called the ad misleading because it showed smokestacks that suggested the production of electricity, and said gas and oil companies are not responsible for the carbon emissions used to make electricity. But the question here is the effect of the measures Johnson voted for. Chip Knappenberger, assistant director of the Center for the Study of Science at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank, told us that as a practical matter, the only way to reduce carbon pollution is to reduce the amount of fossil fuel produced. But he said Johnson's votes do preserve the status quo, which has no limits on greenhouse gas emissions. Our rating The League of Conservation Voters said Johnson voted to let oil and gas companies ""keep spewing unlimited carbon pollution into our air."" Johnson voted twice to prohibit the EPA from regulating any carbon emissions. We rate the statement True.","[('Email interview, League of Conservation Voters national press secretary Jeff Gohringer, Aug. 15, 2013', 'https://youtu.be/XFbnJcHDS4w'), ('Email interview, U.S. Sen.

NRCC says Patrick Murphy ‘voted to keep the scandal-ridden IRS in charge of enforcing Obamacare’
","In a YouTube video published Aug. 22, the National Republican Congressional Committee took a swipe at U.S. Rep. Patrick Murphy, D-Jupiter, for his vote against an attempt to derail the Affordable Care Act. The video’s message: ""The most dreaded return address in America. The IRS. And just days ago, Congressman Patrick Murphy voted to keep the scandal-ridden IRS in charge of enforcing Obamacare. Just what you need. To owe more to the IRS. Under Obamacare, your insurance premiums could double and your personal data could be at risk. Call Patrick Murphy. Ask him to get the IRS out of your health care."" The NRCC published the same YouTube video about U.S. Reps. Carol Shea-Porter, D-N.H., and William Enyart, D-Ill. In this item we’re focusing on whether the IRS is ""in charge"" of enforcing Obamacare. The video leaves the impression that the agency is the chief enforcer over the whole shebang. It is true that Murphy, who represents parts of Palm Beach, Martin and St. Lucie counties, joined most Democrats Aug. 2 in opposing the  ""Keep the IRS Off Your Health Care Act of 2013.""   The congressman’s legislative director, Chris Fisher, said this act ""would prevent the Department of Treasury (and anything under it, including IRS) from enforcing any portion of Obamacare. It's basically a repeal vote for every part of the law that falls under Treasury jurisdiction."" Murphy voted no, Fisher said, because the measure would raise taxes on small businesses and working families. ""The $5,000 small business tax credit and tax credits to help you buy insurance if you are up to 400 percent of the federal poverty line fall under the Treasury,"" Fisher noted. ""These would go away if the anti-IRS bill became law tomorrow."" Murphy was among 185 Democrats who voted against the measure, which passed the House Aug. 2, with the approval of 228 Republicans and four Democrats. It’s the 40th attempt to dismantle the law, which all have failed because Democrats control the Senate and the White House. The video by the NRCC political committee is the latest sweeping comment about the IRS’ role in implementing the new health law -- especially in recent months, since the agency came under fire for giving particular scrutiny to some conservative groups seeking tax exemptions. As to the specific claim, NRCC spokesman Katie Prill said, ""It has been noted by several news organizations that the IRS will play a ‘dominant role’ in enforcing Obamacare"" and referred to a May article from the McClatchy Washington Bureau. It called the IRS an ""important cog"" and said the tax agency ""must act on 47 provisions of the new law, more than half of those already in effect, including the more controversial ones taking effect in 2014 such as the requirement that nearly all non-elderly adults have health care coverage."" But health care policy experts say that implying that the IRS is in charge of enforcing the new health law is misleading. The IRS is certainly involved in implementing the Affordable Care Act, including subsidies and penalties, ""but hardly the whole ACA,"" said Eric Toder, co-director of the Washington-based Tax Policy Center, a joint venture of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution. In a previous fact-check, we noted that the IRS has posted a list of its many roles dealing with the health care law, everything from levying additional payroll taxes on certain high-income Americans to taxation of medical devices and brand-name drugs. Its best known role, beginning in 2014, is to confirm that a taxpayer has health insurance and to assess a financial penalty if they do not. (The penalties start at $95 per adult in 2013 and rise to $695 per adult in 2016.) But states and other agencies, including the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the U.S. Department of Labor and other agencies ""play just as important a role,"" in implementing the new health care law, says Katie Keith, a consultant and former researcher with Georgetown University’s Health Policy Institute. Greg Mellowe, policy director for the healthcare consumer advocacy group, Florida CHAIN, said that responsibility for implementing and enforcing the provisions of the Affordable Care Act is divided by function. The Department of Health and Human Services, not the IRS, is considered the lead agency in this regard, he said. The Department of Labor notes its involvement with regulations that affect employment-based, private-sector, group-health plans. The IRS (Department of the Treasury) has authority with respect to regulations that pertain to income and taxation. ""The IRS is the only entity that can appropriately implement and enforce these tax-related provisions,"" Mellowe said. Moreover, states also have a major role to play -- mainly by running health insurance exchanges. Florida, which opted against creating a state-based exchange, passed legislation, SB 1842, that maintained the state Office of Insurance Regulation’s current authority to review health insurance policy forms for compliance with state and federal laws as part of a collaborative effort with the HHS. For issues of noncompliance with federal law, the OIR would attempt to obtain voluntary compliance and, if they're unable to do that, HHS would provide the enforcement. Our ruling The NRCC video stated that the IRS would be in charge of enforcing Obamacare. While the IRS will play a major role in enforcing elements of the Affordable Care Act, stating that the agency is ""in charge"" of enforcing the new health law is misleading and leaves out the vital roles of the states, the health department, the department of labor and other agencies in enforcing and implementing various aspects of the law. We rate the NRCC’s claim Mostly False.",[],/factchecks/2013/aug/28/national-republican-congressional-committee/nrcc-says-patrick-murphy-voted-keep-scandal-ridden/
"['Immigration', 'National', 'Bipartisanship', 'Janet Napolitano']","
The 2010 DREAM Act had 'strong bipartisan support,' said Janet Napolitano
","Janet Napolitano is set to leave her post as secretary of the Department of Homeland Security after serving for President Barack Obama’s entire first term and into his second. But before leaving, she issued a ringing defense of Obama administration policies, especially when it came to immigration. Napolitano singled out the how the administration has handled young illegal immigrants who were brought as children to the United States. Under Obama’s policies, these young people have been allowed to stay, at least for the time being, under a policy called referred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. Obama authorized the policy after Congress failed to pass legislation called the DREAM Act that would have achieved the same thing on a permanent basis. Napolitano suggested the administration’s hand was forced due to congressional gridlock. ""Congress had a chance to give the so-called dreamers a way to stay in our country through the DREAM Act but, unfortunately, that legislation failed to garner the 60 votes need for cloture, falling just five votes short despite strong bipartisan support,"" she said. (Napolitano is set to leave her post on Sept. 6, 2013, to lead the University of California system.) Her comments got our attention. We didn’t remember strong bipartisan support in the U.S. Senate for the DREAM Act. That sent us looking up congressional votes to see what the vote was. On Dec. 18, 2010, the DREAM Act failed on a cloture vote, where 60 votes are needed to advance the bill. The vote ended up 55 in favor and 41 opposed, with four senators not voting. Among those in favor, the vote included 50 Democrats, three Republicans and two independents. (The three Republicans were Robert Bennett of Utah, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. Only Murkowski still serves.) Among those opposed, the vote included 36 Republicans and five Democrats. There’s some bipartisanship there, but not much. At PolitiFact, we usually describe such votes as failing ""largely along partisan lines."" And in fact, the 2010 DREAM Act vote stands in contrast to more recent Senate votes -- which had much more bipartisan support. The farm bill, for example, passed the Senate 66-27 on June 10, 2013, with 46 Democratic votes, 18 Republican votes and two independents. The comprehensive immigration bill to overhaul the entire immigration system, including the DREAM Act, passed on a 68-32 vote, with 52 Democratic votes, 14 Republican votes and two independents. To satisfy our own curiosity, we decided to compare the relative bipartisanship of the DREAM Act votes with other votes. We set this benchmark: A bill receiving half its support from Democrats and half its support from Republicans would be considered 100 percent bipartisan, which would be a very strong showing of bipartisanship. (There are other ways we could calculate this, but this seemed simple and fair.) Using that measure as a yardstick, the 2010 DREAM Act vote was 6 percent bipartisan. Meanwhile, the 2013 farm bill was 28 percent bipartisan, and this year’s comprehensive immigration bill was 21 percent bipartisan. Napolitano said that bipartisan support for the DREAM Act was ""strong."" Actually, the DREAM Act seems a rather weak display of bipartisanship. (We asked for comment from DHS, but we didn’t hear back.) We should note that we’ve looked closely at the question of what makes a bill bipartisan before. In 2009, Obama claimed that a Senate committee approved a version of the health care law with ""both Democratic and Republican support."" We rated that Mostly False, since it got a single Republican vote out of 14 votes in favor. In 2011, we looked at House Speaker John Boehner’s statement that the House’s ""cut, cap and balance"" budget plan passed the chamber with ""bipartisan support."" We rated that Mostly False, the proposal got five Democratic votes out of 234 in favor. We noted in that report that there is a proud tradition of claiming that a vote is bipartisan, even when it has the barest sliver of votes from the other party. This tradition is -- dare we say it -- bipartisan. But that doesn’t mean it’s accurate. Our ruling Napolitano said that the DREAM Act -- a law that would have allowed young people in the United States illegally to stay -- failed in Congress even though it had ""strong bipartisan support."" We looked up the vote and found that three Republican senators joined 52 other senators on the vote. The bill failed because it required 60 votes. Three Republican senators isn’t ""strong"" bipartisan support, though. In fact, it’s pretty minimal. The vote failed largely along partisan lines. Napolitano’s remarks clearly suggest otherwise. We rate it Mostly False.","[('CQ, Secretary of Homeland Security Napolitano Delivers Farewell Remarks at the National Press Club, accessed Aug. 27, 2013', 'http://www.c-spanvideo.org/program/SecretaryJ'), ('C-SPAN, Secretary Janet Napolitano Farewell Address, Aug. 27, 2013', 'No link'), ('U.S. Senate, On the Cloture Motion (for the DREAM Act), Dec. 18, 2010', 'http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=111&session=2&vote=00278'), ('U.S. Senate, On Passage of the Bill (S. 954 As Amended ), the farm bill vote, June 10, 2013', 'No link'), ('U.S. Senate, On Passage of the Bill (S. 744 As Amended ), the comprehensive immigration bill vote, June 27, 2013', 'http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&session=1&vote=00145'), ('U.S. House of Representatives via GovTrack.US, vote on the DREAM Act, Dec. 8, 2010', 'No link'), ('CNN, House approves DREAM Act, but Senate approval uncertain, Dec. 9, 2010', 'http://www.senate.gov/legislative/LIS/roll_call_lists/roll_call_vote_cfm.cfm?congress=113&session=1&vote=00168'), ('New York Times, Senate Vote 278, Dec. 18, 2010', 'No link'), ('New York Times, Senate Vote 145, June 10, 2013', 'https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/111-2010/h625'), ('New York Times, Senate Vote 168, June 27, 2013', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact, Health care reform bill not that bipartisan, Oct. 19, 2009', 'https://www.cnn.com/2010/POLITICS/12/08/dream.act/index.html'), ('PolitiFact, Bipartisan support for ""cut, cap and balance"", John Boehner says, July 26, 2011', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/aug/28/janet-napolitano/2010-dream-act-has-strong-bipartisan-support-said-/

U.N. treaty is about weapons systems moving between countries
","CLARIFICATION, 4:06 p.m., Aug. 28, 2013: We amended this story to clarify that an explanation naming Sudan and Chad is hypothetical.   ""Ever since its founding 65 years ago, the U.N. has been hell-bent on bringing the U.S. to its knees,"" U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Friendswood, said in a recent fundraising letter. The letter, forwarded to PolitiFact by a reader Aug. 19, 2013, sought donations to the National Association for Gun Rights to battle ""the U.N.’s ‘Small Arms Treaty’ "" and said that the treaty’s provisions include ""mandating a new international gun registry."" Stockman also wrote that the treaty ""sets the stage for confiscation on a global scale."" A ""gun registry"" might facilitate that by telling the United Nations where everybody’s guns are. We wondered whether the treaty really creates a registry. We did not hear back from Stockman or the association about this claim, so we were unable to determine when the letter was sent out or to verify it had not been altered. But the same claim appears on a web page at the association’s site with a shorter version of the letter also attributed to Stockman. PolitiFact has looked at similar claims about the United Nations before, most recently finding that a letter supposedly outlining a U.N. plan to ""disarm civilians"" was fake. In December 2012, PolitiFact Texas rated as Pants on Fire a chain email saying the Obama administration planned to use international treaties to ban all U.S. weapons. And in August 2012, PolitiFact Georgia tackled a claim very similar to Stockman’s. Georgia Republican U.S. Rep. Paul Broun said in a video from the same gun-rights group Stockman was supporting, ""If passed by the U.N. and ratified by the U.S. Senate, the U.N. Small Arms Treaty would almost certainly force the United States to … create an international gun registry, setting the stage for full-scale gun confiscation."" PolitiFact Georgia rated that claim, including its implication of confiscating guns, as False. Among its findings: A July 27, 2012, draft of an Arms Trade Treaty that failed to gain U.N. members’ approval would have required the U.S. to report information on international arms sales. Some background from that story: The U.N. has been working on a treaty to regulate the global arms trade -- not just small arms -- for years. Backers say it would curtail mass killings and terrorism and keep dictators from killing their own people. On April 2, 2013, according to the U.N.’s website, the organization’s General Assembly ""adopted the landmark Arms Trade Treaty, regulating the international trade in conventional arms."" The U.S. said ""Yes"" in that vote, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said Jun. 3, 2013, that President Barack Obama planned to sign the treaty ""before the end of August,"" saying it was ""in the interest of the United States."" For the treaty to take force in the U.S., it would need to be ratified by the U.S. Senate, which on March 23, 2013, voted 53-46 to insert its formal opposition to the treaty into Senate spending legislation. The text of the treaty says its purpose is to regulate the international arms trade and prevent illicit sales and transfers. It applies to arms, ammunition and parts moving across a national border, specifically conventional arms in categories such as ""warships,"" ""combat aircraft"" and ""small arms and light weapons."" The treaty requires nations to deny authorization to exports of such armaments if they will be used for terrorism, to commit genocide, to attack civilians or in other war crimes, and to take ""appropriate measures"" if they detect that a shipment has been diverted. Nations are required to maintain a ""national control system, including a national control list,"" report exports and imports to the U.N. each year and regulate brokering with measures that ""may include requiring brokers to register,"" but the treaty doesn’t specify how countries must carry out these directions. Daniel Prins, chief of the Conventional Arms branch of the U.N. Office for Disarmament Affairs, told us by phone that the national control list will be ""an enumeration of the types of weapons you will report,"" starting with the categories in the treaty (warships, combat aircraft, etc.). Then, each year, nations will report imports and exports in the categories on their lists, Prins said: ""35 tanks to Germany,"" for example. Countries can be more specific, but it’s up to them, he said. The treaty emphasizes that the U.N. is leaving regulation of the arms trade within a country entirely up to that country. The preamble says the parties to the treaty reaffirm ""the sovereign right of any state"" to regulate arms in its own territory ""pursuant to its own legal or constitutional system."" It also says the parties are ""mindful of legitimate trade and lawful ownership."" Article 12 of the treaty requires member nations to keep records of exports and says each country ""is encouraged"" to keep records on arms transferred into or authorized to ship through ""territory under its jurisdiction."" Countries are ""encouraged to include in those records"" the ""quantity, value, model/type,"" the exporting and importing countries and ""end users, as appropriate."" Stockman’s letter includes some of the language in Article 12. Stockman wrote, ""The registry must include the ‘quantity, value, model/type, authorized international transfers of conventional arms’ and the identity of the ‘end user.’ "" But in the treaty, recording those details is ""encouraged,"" not required. Though Article 12 deals primarily with exports, its language also encourages keeping records -- possibly including ""end users"" -- on arms transferred into a country. Prins said the importers, exporters and ""end users"" referred to in the treaty will most often be nations, not individuals. ""This is a treaty on conventional arms, so it’s about battle tanks and attack helicopters and all that stuff,"" as well as small arms, Prins said. ""For each individual weapons system that you export, you want to see where that ends up and where it’s being used."" Giving a hypothetical example, he said, ""If you send that to Sudan and the next moment you see it actually popping up in Chad, then we have an ‘end use’ issue. Because if all went well, (Sudan has) signed an end-user certificate on that transaction,"" meaning ""they are supposed to be the last owner and user."" If the weapons system were used by another country, that would be a breach of contract. He said there should be no effect on, for example, a U.S. citizen buying a gun from a foreign broker because ""whatever broker you engage will need to be registered already with the U.S. government to be able to function as an arms broker."" That’s because the U.S. has some of the strongest arms import and export legislation in the world, he said. With this treaty, Prins said, ""we’re trying to get the world to adopt a transfer system that comes closer to what the U.S. already has."" Our ruling Stockman said a U.N. treaty is  ""mandating a new international gun registry."" His claim takes a treaty intended to curtail illicit weapons trade between countries and describes it as a step toward confiscating gun owners’ property. Nations that ratify the Arms Trade Treaty must track conventional arms that move across their borders, share some information about the transfers with the U.N. and other countries, then report the imports and exports in broad categories such as ""battle tanks"" to the U.N. each year. They must also regulate brokers, but requiring them to ""register"" is optional. Recording details such as the quantity and model of weapons in a shipment is also optional.

Mark Harris says he lowered spending and debt and improved reserves as Winnebago County executive
","Winnebago County Executive Mark Harris, a Democrat mulling a run for governor in 2014, contends that his private-sector experience would put the state on a better course. Making the media rounds this summer, the former bank trust officer has gently criticized Gov. Scott Walker and other Republicans for what he views as overly exuberant tax cuts and borrowing. Harris, as you might expect, thinks his own record on fiscal issues is more responsible. ""I’ve got the spending down, I’ve got the debt down a little bit, I’ve got the reserves up,"" Harris  told journalist Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s ""Upfront"" show July 21, 2013. Harris was first elected county executive in 2005 and previously served as mayor of Oshkosh and on the Oshkosh City Council and Winnebago County Board. He has worked as a certified public accountant in Michigan and Indiana, was a lawyer in Indiana, and worked as a trust officer and vice president at Associated Trust Company in Oshkosh from 1995 until 2005. With Harris pledging to decide on running by Labor Day, we thought it was the right time to check the books on his claims. Here’s what we found: Reserves Average year-end reserves are up considerably in the Harris era, compared with the final four budget years of his predecessor, county financial records show. Under Harris, the county often has kept reserves in excess of its goal of having a cushion totalling one month of the county’s annual spending. The average annual reserve is up more than 50% on average, and in 2012 reserves swelled to nearly two months of spending, prompting the county to suspend new borrowing in 2013. The increase in unrestricted reserves has not been a steady march, but the trend is clear. Spending Harris pointed us to numbers showing that the 2013 adopted county budget set operating spending at 1 percent less than the 2005 budget -- the last one adopted before his election. We confirmed those figures, and found a four-year trend of declining or flat expenditures from 2010-’13, so Harris has some backup. The county’s finance director, Charles Orenstein, told us savings came in part from reining in fringe benefit costs, consolidation and efficiency moves in county facilities, and savings on court and jail costs through technology. But, looking more broadly, the spending trend lines look like a roller-coaster ride. Spending went up in Harris’ first four years. In fact, only in 2013 could Harris make the claim that spending is lower compared with when he came in. In every other year but this one under Harris, the county’s annual spending total was higher than in the last pre-Harris budget. Harris acknowledges that Walker’s curbs on collective bargaining saved the county money, but he contends that state aid cuts offset most if not all of the savings, at least in 2012. The county’s property tax levy has increased 24 percent in eight years under Harris as aid from other levels of government -- a category including the state -- fell off markedly, county budget records show. The property tax levy has fallen the last two years amid tight property tax caps imposed by Walker. Debt Harris said he got the county’s debt down ""a little."" Yes and no. Harris notes that Winnebago County’s outstanding general-obligation debt totalled $59.6 million at year-end 2012, down from $63 million in December 2004, months before he took office in April 2005. In noting that, he uses 2005 as his first year and 2004 as the baseline year. His numbers are correct, and defensible to a point. But, under the county’s capital improvement process, many debt-funded capital projects would have received approval before Harris took office. So both the previous county executive and Harris can claim an influence on the outstanding debt level in 2005. Keeping that in mind, if you instead use 2005 as the baseline year, Harris’ debt claim fails. Debt added up to $57 million in 2005, slightly lower than the mark under Harris in 2012. Harris’ claim, though, is on target by two other measures, average annual debt per capita, and average annual debt in raw dollars. In general, this is a difficult area to judge because huge projects -- a new nursing home built on Harris’ watch, for instance -- spike borrowing in certain years. The Credit Game One final issue. Harris credited himself for driving the fiscal trends. But he acknowledged that the County Board deserves some credit as well. And two veteran Winnebago County Board leaders, David Albrecht and Patrick Brennand, told us that former County Executive Jane Van De Hey and others also helped instill a cautious approach to spending. There’s also the effect of the state budget, which helped the county drive down costs while also cutting aid to the county. Our rating Harris said, ""I’ve got the spending down, I’ve got the debt down a little bit, I’ve got the reserves up."" He was referring to his tenure as Winnebago County executive from April 2005 to the present. He makes the best case on reserves, which clearly have risen. Spending is down when viewed narrowly. The debt burden has dropped by some measures but not by all. Harris deserves some credit for the trends, but not all. We rate his claim Mostly True.","[('Mark Harris interview with Mike Gousha, ""Upfront"" show, WISN-TV, July 20, 2013', 'http://www.wisn.com/politics/upfront/Harris-considering-governor-s-race/-/10057538/21083628/-/ndsk42/-/index.html'), ('Wisconsin Eye, video archive, Mark Harris, Democratic Party of Wisconsin convention interview, June 7, 2013', 'No link'), ('Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Winnebago County exec says he’s leaning toward Democratic run for governor,"" Aug. 19, 2013', 'http://www.wiseye.org/videoplayer/vp.html?sid=10215'), ('Interview with Mark Harris, Winnebago County executive, Aug. 21, 2013', 'No link'), ('Interview with Charles Orenstein, finance director, Winnebago County, Aug. 22, 2013', 'http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/winnebago-county-exec-says-hes-leaning-toward-democratic-run-for-governor-b9978874z1-220240181.html'), ('Interview with David Albrecht, chairman, Winnebago County Board, Aug. 22, 2013', 'No link'), ('Interview with Patrick Brennand, vice chairman, Winnebago County Board of Supervisors, Aug. 21, 2013', 'http://www.co.winnebago.wi.us/sites/default/files/finance/budget/2013adoptedbudget.pdf'), ('Winnebago County Finance Department, 2013 adopted county budget', 'No link'), ('Winnebago County Finance Department, 2005 adopted county budget', 'https://web.archive.org/web/20060225051823/http://www.co.winnebago.wi.us/finance/budget.htm'), ('Winnebago County Finance Department, archive of Comprehensive Annual Financial Reports', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/aug/28/mark-harris-wisc/mark-harris-says-he-lowered-spending-and-debt-and-/

Candidate overstates past fundraising totals
","The race to lead the Democratic Party of Georgia is in the homestretch, and one candidate’s purported fundraising prowess drew our attention. ""A lot of you know that the Republicans gerrymandered my district in 2012 so they can get a supermajority in the Senate,"" former state lawmaker Doug Stoner, a candidate for the chairmanship, said during a recent forum. ""It’s a district that 64 percent of the folks voted for John McCain (in the 2008 presidential election). The point of all of this is I didn’t give up. I continued to work and I fought hard for that seat. I only lost by four points. I raised over $700,000. I have a real plan to … fund, build and engage this party."" A PolitiFact Georgia reader did some checking and questioned Stoner’s claim that he raised $700,000 in his last campaign. Fundraising has been a problem for the party. The prior chairman, Mike Berlon, resigned in May, in part, because the party’s pockets were empty in comparison with their Republican counterparts. In April, the Democrats had $30,000 in cash while Republicans had 20 times as much money, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported. Stoner believes he can do a better job raising money for the party as party chairman. He’s one of three candidates vying for the position and the AJC has reported he has the backing of Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed, former Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes and Mary Squires, who had been in the race. The election is scheduled for Saturday. About 300 people -- mostly state committee members -- are eligible to vote, said Liz Flowers, a party spokeswoman. Stoner spent two years in the Georgia House of Representatives before he was elected to the Georgia Senate in 2004. The Cobb County native served eight years in the Senate before losing to Republican Hunter Hill in November. The Republican-led Georgia Legislature reshaped the district’s boundary lines before the 2012 election, which Stoner still says made it easier for Hill to win. The district includes Sandy Springs, Smyrna and Vinings. ""Doug Stoner stood up to Republican voting map gerrymandering and ran a tough campaign in a seat created for a GOP win,"" he says on his website. ""Doug came within four points of winning the seat, raising upwards of $700,000."" PolitiFact found information that seemed to contradict Stoner’s claim. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution’s Political Insider column reported in late October that Stoner’s Republican opponent ""has raised $411,012 -- nearly double the amount of the Democratic incumbent."" Stoner reported raising $273,513 for that race, according to paperwork filed with the Georgia Government Transparency and Campaign Finance Commission. The commission was formerly known as the state Ethics Commission. Stoner explained the discrepancy. ""Three hundred thousand (dollars) is about right for my 2012 race, but $700,000 is what I’ve raised for all my races,"" he said. Stoner directed us to Influence Exporter, a website that counts campaign contributions and who gives the politicians money. The website found Stoner raised $233,394 for his 2012 race and $708,657 for all his campaigns. As for the similar claim on his website, Stoner said it should say he raised a cumulative total of about $700,000 through all his races. Monday afternoon, Stoner told PolitiFact that he would have his staff post the correct information. It hadn’t been changed by Tuesday afternoon. To sum up, Stoner said he had raised about $700,000 in his 2012 campaign for a state Senate seat. Stoner said he meant $700,000 over the course of all his political campaigns. But the statements he made at the candidate forum and on his website leave a vastly different impression.

Moms Demand Action says 'Little Red Riding Hood' has been banned, but assault weapons haven't
","The image created by a pro-gun control group and widely shared on social media is designed to be provocative. Two youngsters sit in a children’s section of a library, one holding a fairy tale book and the other holding an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. The caption: ""One child is holding something that's been banned in America to protect them. Guess which one."" The ad was created by Grey Group, an international ad agency, on behalf of Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America. Moms Demand Action was founded in the wake of the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., by Shannon Watts, a 42-year-old Indiana mother who has worked as a communications executive. The group claims tens of thousands of members and more than 75 local chapters, and it has been active in organizing on gun policy through social media. A reader forwarded us the ad with the two children, asking us to take a closer look. We decided to check whether Little Red Riding Hood, the book held by the child, is something ""that’s been banned in America,"" and whether assault weapons haven’t been. We will start by noting that Watts, who did not respond to a request from PolitiFact, acknowledges that the ads are designed to be provocative. She told Yahoo! earlier this year that the ad is ""obviously meant to make a point and create discussion. The (National Rifle Association) has been very, very good at creating fear among their members that their rights are going to be taken away or somehow the government is going to turn against them. We're trying to create debate and discussion about the facts."" Still, we don’t think being provocative exempts the ad from being scrutinized for accuracy. 'Little Red Riding Hood' The Little Red Riding Hood shown in the image has indeed been banned before. The version of the 17th century fairy tale was adapted by the late, Caldecott Medal-winning illustrator Trina Schart Hyman and was originally published in 1987. According to media accounts, the volume became a target because one image showed a bottle of wine in the girl’s basket, a detail that had been included in the original version of the fairy tale. An Associated Press article quoted Culver City, Calif., assistant superintendent for instruction Vera Jashni saying that the inclusion of wine in the book ""gives the younger ones the wrong impression about alcohol. If they should refrain, why give them a story saying it's okay?'' Jashni told the AP that she was worried about lines in the book that said, ""The grandmother drank some of the wine, and ... after a while, the grandmother felt quite strong and healthy, and began to clean up the mess that the wolf had left in the cottage.'' So the Moms Demand Action ad has a point that the Hyman edition of Little Red Riding Hood has been banned before. Still, it’s worth noting some additional context. For more background, we contacted the American Library Association, the leading authority for tracking books that have been banned or challenged by parents in schools and libraries across the United States. It turns out that the only recorded examples of Little Red Riding Hood being banned took place in 1990 -- 23 years ago -- and occurred in just two California school districts, Culver City and Empire Union. When we asked the Culver City school district if the ban is still in place, they said it has been reversed. The American Library Association recorded three additional cases involving the volume, in Florida’s Bradford, Clay and Levy counties in 1990 and 1991. (One of the complaints in Bradford was that the wolf was too scary.) In these cases, parents or teachers challenged the books but administrators took no action to ban them. Indeed, Little Red Riding Hood doesn’t appear on any of the library association’s lists of most frequently banned books. The list of frequently banned and challenged ""classic"" books includes The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald, The Catcher in the Rye by J.D. Salinger, The Grapes of Wrath by John Steinbeck, To Kill a Mockingbird by Harper Lee and The Color Purple by Alice Walker. Frequently banned kids’ books include the Harry Potter series by J.K. Rowling and the Captain Underpants series by Dav Pilkey. So while the ad has a point that one version of Little Red Riding Hood has been banned in the past, there’s no evidence of it being banned during the past 23 years, and there’s no evidence of any bans outside of two school districts. Assault weapons The ad also has a point that there is currently no national assault-weapon ban. Such a ban was in force from 1994 to 2004, but it expired, and opposition from gun-rights advocates has kept it from being revived by Congress. However, a fact that somewhat undercuts the ad’s stark contrast is that seven states do ban assault weapons -- California, Connecticut, Hawaii (assault pistols only), Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey and New York, plus the District of Columbia. Collectively, these states account for about 27 percent of the nation’s population. In other words, it’s inaccurate to suggest that assault weapons haven’t been banned anywhere in America. States also typically ban the sale of firearms to the elementary schoolers pictured in the ad. Of course, supporters of tighter gun laws note that state bans aren’t especially useful in the absence of a national law, since assault weapons can easily be carried across state borders. Our ruling Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America’s ad said that Little Red Riding Hood is something ""that’s been banned in America,"" but assault weapons haven’t been. We understand what the ad is trying to do, but its black-and-white language obscures that the ""bans"" being compared are not so clear-cut. Little Red Riding Hood was banned only in two school districts and nearly a quarter century ago; many books have been banned much more recently, and much more frequently, than that. In the meantime, there’s no national assault-weapons ban, but more than a quarter of Americans live in states that have banned assault weapons. The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.","[('Yahoo! ""Little Red Riding Hood and AR-15s?

Super PAC criticizes Booker for low Newark graduation rate
","It was a match made in social media heaven when Facebook founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg partnered publicly with tweet-happy Newark Mayor Cory Booker in September 2010. The two, along with New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, appeared on The Oprah Winfrey Show to announce a $100 million donation from Zuckerberg to be put toward public education in the city. Fast forward three years. Booker’s in the middle of a U.S. Senate race and a super PAC called American Commitment made a website called BookerFail to highlight criticism of him. ""Three years after getting the $100 million, less than two-thirds of students in Cory Booker's Newark graduate,"" said a BookerFail video criticizing Booker for his inability to improve Newark public schools. We’ll look at how Newark schools have done since Zuckerberg’s donation, but first we’ll explain how his donation was made and to whom. Grant specifics Zuckerberg donated $100 million nearly three years ago to start a foundation for education called the Foundation for Newark’s Future. The money is a matching grant, so the foundation only spends as many dollars as other donors also contribute. The money must be used by 2015, said Kim McLain, the foundation’s president and CEO. The foundation divides grant funds into six categories, with ""teacher quality and principal leadership"" getting by far the largest chunk of money so far. That money goes toward funding merit pay, a controversial system of paying higher salaries to teachers whose students earn high test scores. More than $75 million has been allotted to the different causes in total, the foundation reported. McClain declined to say how much money has been matched so far, so it's unclear how much of Zuckerberg's donation has been spent. How big is this contribution, really? It amounts to little more than pocket change for a school district of Newark’s size, as it turns out. For perspective, consider that Newark’s entire yearly education budget is roughly $1 billion, so that’s $5 billion over the period of time when Zuckerberg’s money can be spent. ""It’s not a game-changer,"" said Paul Tractenberg, founder of the Institute on Education Law and Policy at Rutgers University-Newark. ""If you use the money tactically, it’s enough money to do some interesting things."" It’s also key that this money and the matching funds went directly to the foundation, not the city of Newark. When it comes to Newark schools, Booker doesn’t have any legal say in his role as mayor, and neither does any other city government official under his watch. The state has controlled the district’s schools for almost 20 years. The state appellate court ruled in July that the district isn’t yet ready for autonomy, based on its test scores and graduation rates. ""Whatever role he has, it’s a secondary, indirect role,"" Tractenberg said. ""My impression is Cory Booker has backed off a lot from his early more direct engagements in education reform."" The mayor does sit on the foundation’s board of directors, his most direct involvement with the Zuckerberg funds. The mayor’s primary role has been helping find funders to match Zuckerberg’s donation. Because Booker legally must let the state make education decisions in his city, it’s not as if any successes or failures the district has can be traced back to him or his staff. Just because Booker is on the board doesn’t mean he has full authority in spending the funds. Making the grade Aside from the question of Booker’s control over the district, the other key part of the ad is whether or not ""less than two-thirds of students"" graduate. The graduation rate for 2012 graduates was 68.72 percent, which is just a tad over two-thirds of students. The video, posted earlier this month, references 2011 numbers, according to an email source list sent by Stephen Manfredi, spokesman for American Commitment. In 2011 the graduation rate was 61.26 percent, which is under two-thirds. So the video features a graduation rate that does, by experts’ standards, indeed leave lots of room for improvement. We won’t go back further than 2011 to check the change in graduation rate over time, because that’s when the methodology used to calculate those numbers, was last changed. What the video doesn’t mention is that the graduation rate has recently improved. Between 2011 and 2012, the graduation rate increased nearly 7 percentage points. That represents the largest growth out of all of New Jersey’s urban districts, Booker for Senate spokeswoman Silvia Alvarez wrote in an email. That’s not for nothing. Still, placing too much importance on good or bad graduation numbers isn’t a holistic way of evaluating schools’ performances, said Eden Kyse, director of the Center for Research and Evaluation on Education and Human Services at Montclair State University. ""It doesn’t tell the whole story,"" Kyse said. ""It’s an indicator."" As the Foundation for Newark’s Future spends Zuckerberg’s money, they know improving education isn’t something that’s solved with a few years’ worth of graduation statistics, McLain said. ""Newark public schools need to be improved and provide for better educational outcomes for kids,"" McLain said. ""We believe our work and our effort will assist that. It’s not going to happen overnight."" Our ruling A super PAC’s ad criticized Mayor Booker for Newark’s low graduation rate three years after Zuckerberg donated $100 million to improving the city’s education. Newark does have a graduation rate right around two-thirds -- it's actually a touch higher than that -- but there’s more to the picture. Despite the ad’s implications, the city’s graduation rate is on the rise. The ad’s phrasing also implies that Booker is the official responsible for schools even though he’s not in charge of them. The money is only a small sliver of the school district's overall budget, and it hasn't all been spent yet, so it's not clear if it's had time to make an impact. Because the ad omits necessary context about the grant money and Newark’s improving graduation rate, in addition to implying that Booker is to blame, we rate this claim Mostly False.","[('BookerFail, ""A Record of Failure (Cory Booker),"" Aug. 1, 2013', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8p4llvVh-A'), ('Email interview with Silvia Alvarez, Booker for Senate spokeswoman, Aug. 27, 2013', 'No link'), ('Email interview with Stephen Manfredi, American Commitment spokesman, Aug. 21, 2013', 'http://foundationfornewarksfuture.org/grants/'), ('Foundation for Newark’s Future, ""Grants,"" accessed Aug. 26, 2013', 'No link'), ('New Jersey Department of Education, ""New Jersey High School Graduation Rate Increases to 86% in 2011-12 School Year, While Turnaround Schools Make Significant Gains Across the State,"" Dec. 5, 2012', 'http://www.state.nj.us/education/news/2012/1205grad.htm'), ('New York Times, ""Facebook Founder to Donate $100 Million to Help Remake Newark’s Schools,"" Sept. 22, 2010', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with Eden Kyse, director of the Center for Research and Evaluation on Education and Human Services at Montclair State University, Aug. 23, 2013', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/23/education/23newark.html?_r=0'), ('Phone interview with Kim McLain, Foundation for Newark’s Future president, Aug. 23, 2013', 'No link'), ('Phone interview with spokesman James Allen and education policy adviser Jarrad Toussant, City of Newark, Aug. 22, 2013', 'https://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/jun/15/chris-christie/gov-chris-christie-says-graduation-rate-29-percent/'), ('Phone interview with Paul Tractenberg, founder of the Institute on Education Law and Policy at Rutgers University-Newark, Aug. 23, 2013', 'No link'), ('PolitiFact New Jersey, ""Gov.
