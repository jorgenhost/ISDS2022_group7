Hydroxychloroquine is not proven to treat COVID-19 or radiation sickness
","A popular Facebook post ties a recurring falsehood about a potential coronavirus treatment to a conspiracy theory about 5G cell phone networks. ""Hydroxychloroquine cures this ‘virus,’"" reads the text post, which was published May 14 in an anti-vaccine group targeting billionaire Bill Gates. ""It just so happens this is the treatment used for radiation sickness!!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Since President Donald Trump first touted the drug as a potential coronavirus treatment during a March press briefing, we have fact-checked dozens of claims about hydroxychloroquine, which has previously been used for treating malaria and inflammatory disorders such as lupus and arthritis. Seeing as Trump is now taking the drug to lessen symptoms in case he is sickened with COVID-19, we figured we should check this post, too. (Screenshot from Facebook) The post is inaccurate. We reached out to the original poster for their sources, but we haven’t heard back. There is no cure or vaccine for the novel coronavirus. Some studies have found that hydroxychloroquine could help alleviate symptoms associated with COVID-19, but the research is not conclusive. Two studies, one from France and one from China, found that hydroxychloroquine helped people clear the virus quickly and alleviate symptoms. But two other studies found that the drug had no discernible effect on the coronavirus. A more recent, large-scale study of nearly 1,400 New York-area patients with moderate to severe COVID-19 also found that patients fared no better by taking hydroxychloroquine. With more than 50 studies in the works, as well as a clinical trial from the National Institutes of Health, it’s too soon to say whether hydroxychloroquine is a viable treatment for the coronavirus. The Food and Drug Administration has warned that the drug’s use outside of hospitals could contribute to heart rhythm problems. The Facebook post’s claim about radiation sickness is also inaccurate. Hydroxychloroquine is not listed by the CDC or the Mayo Clinic as a treatment for radiation sickness, which is caused by a large dose of radiation over a short period of time. The condition is treated by removing radioactive particles outside the body or using substances like potassium iodide to reduce damage to internal organs. RELATED: Hydroxychloroquine and coronavirus: what you need to know Why is radiation sickness mentioned in the post? It has to do with recurring conspiracy theories about 5G, Gates and Dr. Anthony Fauci — all of which are popular among anti-vaccine groups on Facebook. For months, conspiracy theorists and alternative health practitioners have claimed that 5G data networks, the latest upgrade to speed up wireless internet connections, could have adverse health effects. Some experts are concerned about the potential effects of the millimeter waves used in 5G technology, but there is no evidence that they cause radiation sickness. ""To date, and after much research performed, no adverse health effect has been causally linked with exposure to wireless technologies,"" the World Health Organization wrote in February. Both Gates and Fauci, director of National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, have tempered expectations for hydroxychloroquine and stressed the importance of developing a coronavirus vaccine. Those views have fueled conspiracy theories, widely shared in anti-vaccine groups, about both men’s connections to the pharmaceutical industry. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968A2580>],/factchecks/2020/may/19/facebook-posts/hydroxychloroquine-not-proven-treat-covid-19-or-ra/

No, there aren’t set amounts hospitals are paid for deaths from flu vs COVID-19
","Medicare is adding 20% to its regular reimbursements to hospitals for the treatment of COVID-19 victims. That’s a result of a federal stimulus law that was passed in response to the coronavirus pandemic. But do hospitals get paid 23 times as much for a patient who dies from COVID-19 as for a patient who dies from the flu? That’s the claim of a Facebook post that says: ""Check this out! Hospitals get $750 if you die from the flu, and $17,500 if you died from COVID-19. Now think about that!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We’ve looked into other claims that point to the differences in reimbursement levels to suggest that hospitals have a financial incentive to improperly diagnose cases as COVID-19. But experts say if anything, the illness is being underdiagnosed.  In any case, the dollar amounts claimed in this post about flu and COVID-19 are misleading. The main thing to know is there are no set amounts paid to hospitals for either type of patient. The $17,500 claimed roughly matches the average amount Medicare paid hospitals before this year’s outbreak for a patient with a COVID-like respiratory infection, such as pneumonia, who needed a certain amount of care. But private insurance typically pays twice as much as Medicare does, Tricia Neuman, who leads Kaiser Family Foundation’s program on Medicare policy, told PolitiFact. As for the amount claimed for a flu patient, ""no hospitalization ever costs $750 and has not in 30 years,"" said Gerard Anderson, a professor at the Johns Hopkins Center for Hospital Finance and Management. The federal government has decided to pay hospitals extra for treating COVID-19 patients on Medicare. Congress added the provision because hospitals have lost revenue from routine care and elective surgeries that they couldn't provide during the crisis, and because the cost of providing even routine services to COVID patients has increased.  From March through June, hospitals will lose an estimated $202.6 billion as a result of the high cost of COVID-19 care and lost revenue from canceled procedures, according to the American Hospital Association. Under the CARES Act, the largest of the three federal stimulus laws enacted in response to the coronavirus, Medicare pays hospitals a 20% ""add on"" to its regular payment for COVID-19 patients.  But there is no indication that hospitals are over-identifying patients as having COVID-19 for the sake of padding their revenue. If anything, evidence suggests the illness is being underdiagnosed. Medicare pays hospitals based on a diagnosis; whether a patient dies does not affect the amount. And even then, the same diagnosis might trigger one reimbursement amount at one hospital, and a different payment at a hospital in another location, to take into account wage differences across the country and other factors. Neuman said $17,500 was roughly the average amount paid for a particular type of patient with a COVID-related diagnosis — one who has respiratory infection with complications  and who needs a ventilator for up to 96 hours. That’s based on estimates Kaiser did in 2017. The 20% add-on would raise that payment to nearly $21,000. As for the Facebook post’s claim of a $750 payment for a flu patient, ""there is almost nothing in a hospital that only costs $750,"" said Dr. Bob Kocher, a partner at the Venrock venture-capital firm and a senior fellow at the Center for Health Policy and Economics at the University of Southern California. ""An emergency-room visit costs more than that."" Moreover, a patient with the flu who is admitted to a hospital and then dies typically would have multiple comorbidities, such as a heart condition, requiring a range of treatments and incurring costs substantially larger than $750, said Joseph Antos, a scholar in health care at the American Enterprise Institute. ""There is no single number that correctly characterizes Medicare's payment, but it is fair to say that the numbers presented here do not represent a true average Medicare payment for either type of patient,"" Antos said. A Facebook post claimed that hospitals get paid $750 for patients who die from the flu, $17,500 for COVID-19. The $17,500 was roughly the average amount Medicare paid for a particular type of patient with a COVID-related diagnosis — one who has respiratory infection with complications and who needs a ventilator for up to 96 hours, according to Kaiser Family Foundation estimates for 2017. But hospitals are not paid set amounts for patients who die from the flu or from COVID-19. Medicare pays hospitals based primarily on a diagnosis, and the amount is not directly affected by whether a patient dies. And payments vary based on how much treatment a patient needs, the location of a hospital, to take into account wage differences, and other factors. The post misrepresents the way hospital reimbursements are determined and uses misleading numbers.

House coronavirus bill would aid immigrants, relatives cut out of previous aid package
","House Democrats are advocating legislation that would send Americans a new round of checks to help with financial problems caused by the coronavirus pandemic. A Facebook post says that under their proposal, immigrants in the country illegally also stand to benefit, getting billions of dollars. ""Pelosi’s new coronavirus bill allows illegals to receive billions in relief funds in past, current, and future payments,"" said text over a photo of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi holding a gavel, with a crowd of people, purportedly immigrants, in the background. The caption on the May 12 Facebook post said the payments ""would not just be a one-time check, they would give them past, current any future payments of YOUR money as 33 million Americans are unemployed."" The post is from We Build The Wall, Inc., a group that's raising money to build sections of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Pelosi does support a bill that would allow immigrants who are in the country illegally and who pay taxes to get coronavirus emergency aid from the federal government. But the Facebook post needs clarification and additional information. The Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act, or the HEROES Act, was introduced May 12 and passed the House May 15, 208-199, with only one Republican vote.  Among the key provisions of the roughly $3 trillion bill, it gives nearly $1 trillion to state and local governments, creates a $200 billion hazard-pay fund for essential workers, and provides $75 billion to support coronavirus testing, contact tracing and patient isolation. The bill also offers a new round of direct payments to families — $1,200 per person and up to $6,000 per household. The payments would go out to people who filed tax returns for 2018 or 2019 (and to some who didn’t), with the total amount based on income. For instance, a single person who earned less than $75,000 would get $1,200; those who earned $75,000 or more would receive less.  The proposal seeks to augment the financial assistance that started mid-April when one-time checks were sent under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act. Under the CARES Act, however, U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents were ineligible for a check if they filed a joint tax return with a spouse who used an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN. ITINs are issued by the IRS to people who don’t have a Social Security number, including immigrants in the country illegally, so they can use it to pay federal income taxes. (Some international students and researchers and their spouses also use ITINs.)  The IRS in 2014 said ITIN filers pay over $9 billion in annual payroll taxes. RELATED: Claim about stimulus check eligibility for Americans married to immigrants missing context Pelosi and other House Democrats have said that ""mixed-status"" families should not have been left out of the CARES Act. So the proposed HEROES Act includes them in its aid package, and retroactively makes ITIN filers eligible for the CARES Act payment as well. The left-leaning Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, using IRS data, estimated that this provision would benefit more than 4.3 million adults and 3.5 million children in households of ITIN filers or of mixed immigration status, paying them a total $16.4 billion ($7 billion under the CARES Act and $9.4 billion under the HEROES Act). The beneficiary figures include ITIN filers as well as their spouses and children who are U.S. citizens or lawful permanent residents. Meg Wiehe, deputy executive director of the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, said it was difficult to discern from the IRS data exactly how many prospective beneficiaries are immigrants in the U.S. illegally. Julia Gelatt, senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute, said a lot of U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents can get support through unemployment insurance, stimulus payments, food stamps and other public benefits. ITINs are used for federal tax reporting, but they do not provide legal immigration status, and immigrants in the country illegally are generally ineligible for federal public benefits, such as food stamps. The goal of the HEROES Act, as it relates to unauthorized immigrants and their family members, is to help people who are struggling financially and who have no access to other financial support, Gelatt said. The HEROES Act financial assistance isn’t exclusive to ITIN filers; U.S. citizens and green-card holders who file taxes using a Social Security number would also benefit, with the same aid amounts and income thresholds. The payments to all eligible people are estimated to cost more than $400 billion. A Facebook post said, ""Pelosi’s new coronavirus bill allows illegals to receive billions in relief funds in past, current, and future payments."" The HEROES Act, a proposal backed by Pelosi, would allow immigrants who are in the country illegally and who pay taxes to receive federal relief funds during the coronavirus pandemic. Immigrants who pay taxes using an ITIN would be eligible for an aid payment under the HEROES Act, and retroactively under the CARES Act, which corresponds to the ""current"" and ""past"" payments cited in the post. It’s unclear what is meant by ""future"" payment. We contacted We Build the Wall for comment, but did not hear back. A tax policy group estimated that if the HEROES Act became law as written, about $16.4 billion would go to households of ITIN filers or of mixed status. Beneficiaries would include U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who live in a household with an ITIN filer. The post is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Might cannabis prevent COVID-19? Preliminary study provides only scant evidence
","Weed preventing COVID-19? That high hope seemed to rise from this headline: ""Cannabis May Stop Coronavirus From Infecting People, Study Finds."" The headline appeared on an article on MerryJane.com that was widely shared on Facebook. But readers should not get too excited. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The website updated its headline with more accurate information following the publication of this fact-check. A preliminary study supported researchers’ theory that certain cannabis extracts could be used as part of a treatment to prevent coronavirus infections. But the study has not been peer reviewed and no testing has yet been done on humans. ""Yes, this is an overstatement,"" Igor Kovalchuk, the lead researcher of the study, told PolitiFact about the headline. Cannabis and marijuana are not exactly the same. Cannabis refers to all products derived from the plant Cannabis sativa. The cannabis plant contains about 540 chemical substances. Marijuana refers to parts of, or products from, the plant Cannabis sativa that contain substantial amounts of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC is the substance that’s primarily responsible for the effects of marijuana on a person’s mental state.  The website that published the article is part of Los Angeles-based Merry Jane, which describes itself as a ""multi-media and lifestyle company that’s creating the new mainstream culture by connecting cannabis and pop culture."" The article, however, is more nuanced than its headline. The article says that based on the study, ""cannabis extracts could work as an ‘adjunct therapy’ in new medical products that could reduce the chances of someone getting COVID-19.""  In other words, despite the headline on the article, the study isn’t saying cannabis alone could prevent infection.  The study referred to in the article was done by six researchers from universities of Lethbridge and Calgary, both in Canada. The researchers are also affiliated with two startup companies that do medical cannabis and disease research. Their study was published April 19 in Preprints, which describes itself as a platform for ""early versions of research outputs"" that are not peer-reviewed.  So, this is a preliminary research paper. According to the study, all cannabis plants for the study were grown in a licensed facility at the University of Lethbridge to obtain the extracts, which were then applied to artificial human 3D tissue models of oral, airway and intestinal tissues. ""Application was intended to model medical delivery, such as local mouthwash applications, encapsulated extracts and dosed oils, and inhalers or nebulizers, and therefore these results cannot be extrapolated to the effects of cannabis smoking,"" the study said. The extracts, ""pending further investigation, may become a useful and safe addition to the treatment of COVID-19 as an adjunct therapy,"" the study concluded.  These extracts also ""can be used to develop easy-to-use preventative treatments in the form of mouthwash and throat gargle products for both clinical and at-home use. Such products ought to be tested for their potential to decrease viral entry via the oral mucosa. Given the current dire and rapidly evolving epidemiological situation, every possible therapeutic opportunity and avenue must be considered."" In short, the researchers theorize that cannabis extracts could interfere with the virus’ process of infection in cells — but this is based on laboratory testing on specially engineered tissue to fully mimic human organs, not testing on humans. ""Clinical trial (on humans) is a must,"" to determine whether extracts could help prevent COVID-19, Kovalchuk said. Virologist Angela Rasmussen, a research scientist at Columbia University, told PolitiFact ""it may be worth more study, but in my opinion this is a very long way from being a legitimate candidate for therapeutics or preventative products like mouthwash."" The headline of an article shared on Facebook said: ""Cannabis may stop coronavirus from infecting people, study finds."" The study found, based on lab testing, that cannabis extracts could be part of a treatment that dramatically reduces the chances of being infected by COVID-10.  But the study is preliminary, has not been peer reviewed and tests on humans would need to be done to determine if the extracts could be part of a treatment that blocks the coronavirus, the study’s lead author said.  The headline contains only an element of truth. Our ruling is Mostly False. Clarification, May 28, 2020: The study found cannabis extracts should be investigated as an adjuct treatment for COVID-19 in addition to its use in possible preventative products like mouthwash. This story has been updated to better reflect that distinction. Update, June 1, 2020: This story has been updated to reflect that MerryJane.com changed its headline following publication of this fact-check.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F3FC80>],/factchecks/2020/may/18/facebook-posts/fact-checking-whether-cannabis-may-prevent-covid-1/

What Bill Gates has to do with livestock, lab-grown meat
","Billionaire philanthropist and Microsoft founder Bill Gates is the target of yet another widespread Facebook post, this time for his support of efforts to create climate-friendly meat replacements. ""Bill Gates worked to end livestock production, and is pushing lab grown meat,"" said a May 4 Facebook post. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In this case, the post is accurate in one way and misleading in another. Gates has invested in numerous companies working to make meat substitutes using plant-based ingredients and, in some cases, laboratory technology. But we found no evidence that Gates has worked to wipe out livestock production. The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation did not respond to a request for comment. News reports from the last several years indicate that Gates has at different times invested in start-ups focused on developing artificial or plant-based alternatives to meat, such as Nature’s Fynd, Hampton Creek, Memphis Meats, Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods.  Impossible Foods, for example, makes burger patties that use soy and potatoes for protein. The patties get their flavor from heme, an iron-rich molecule found in meat and plants that sparked some controversy but was approved for use by the Food and Drug Administration. According to the Washington Post, the company’s heme ""is made by taking the DNA from the roots of soy plants, inserting it into genetically engineered yeast and then fermenting that yeast."" Other companies are even more lab-oriented. Memphis Meats uses biotechnology to grow meat in what its website describes as a four-to-six-week process that involves ""sourcing high-quality cells from animals"" and ""cultivat(ing) the cells into meat."" ""Gates has indeed invested in several non-animal alt-protein companies, including Memphis Meats, which grows real meat from animal cells,"" said Paul Shapiro, author of ""Clean Meat: How Growing Meat Without Animals Will Revolutionize Dinner and the World."" In an October interview with Bloomberg News, Gates celebrated Impossible Foods and Beyond Meat for their plant-based meat substitutes. He said he had invested in both and that their products will contribute to a ""dramatic reduction in methane emissions, animal cruelty, manure management and the pressure that meat consumption puts on land use."" He’s made similar points on his personal blog, GatesNotes, writing in one post that a rising population requires more food and that farming livestock can take a toll on the environment and require increased deforestation to make room for the animals.  Livestock are responsible for 14.5% of greenhouse gas emissions each year, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. ""Raising meat takes a great deal of land and water and has a substantial environmental impact,"" Gates wrote in a 2013 blog post. ""Put simply, there’s no way to produce enough meat for (a future population of) 9 billion people. Yet we can’t ask everyone to become vegetarians."" ""That’s why we need more options for producing meat without depleting our resources,"" he said. We found no proof that Gates has worked to end livestock production completely. ""He's never said his goal is to end livestock production, and he actually funds some projects to boost livestock-rearing in developing countries,"" Shapiro said. Shapiro cited the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s agricultural development efforts and a news article detailing $40 million the foundation put toward research and projects to breed cows that produce more milk. ""If you care about the poor, you should care about agriculture, and if you care about agriculture, you care about livestock,"" Gates said in 2018, according to Reuters. ""What that means in this context is helping poor farmers get as much as possible out of their animals."" The foundation has also paid out a number of related grants, according to its website, such as a nearly $8 million grant to the International Livestock Research Institute in November to help ""advocate for investment in livestock development globally,"" among other things. We searched Google and the Nexis database and found no credible reports showing Gates has worked to end livestock production or said he would like to do so. On the contrary, Gates wrote in his blog that if he were living in extreme poverty, he would raise chickens. In another post, he said that despite the implications on the climate, ""We can’t simply get rid of soil — or stop growing crops, using fertilizer, and raising livestock."" A Facebook post said ""Bill Gates worked to end livestock production, and is pushing lab grown meat."" Gates has invested at different times in several companies working to make meat replacements. Some of those companies are using biotechnology to grow their products in labs. But we found no evidence that he has tried to get rid of all livestock production.

Face masks, including homemade ones, are effective COVID-19 protection, experts say
","This story reflects medical expert advice in May of 2020, when the coronavirus first emerged. Scientists have tweaked and updated their recommendations as the pandemic has progressed and as variants have emerged. Here is the latest on mask-wearing (January 2022) >> Face masks have become a controversial symbol of the fight against COVID-19.  Varying state rules and shifting guidance from leading health officials has caused confusion over who should be wearing masks and whether some types are effective at slowing disease transmission.  UPDATE: Is my cloth mask good enough? The 2022 edition  Take this Facebook post, for example. It displays an image of four different masks: An N95, a surgical mask, a sponge and a cloth mask. It claims that N95 and surgical masks both provide 95% protection, while sponge and cloth masks offer none. Let’s just get to the point: This isn’t true. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Medical masks, like the N95, offer the most protection, but experts widely agree that several types of facial coverings, including ones made of fabric, are effective at slowing virus spread.  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention initially deterred people from wearing face masks unless they had COVID-19 and were showing symptoms. But that guidance changed on April 3, after studies found that the virus can be spread by asymptomatic individuals, or before symptoms start to show. Now, the CDC recommends that nearly everyone wear a facial covering in public and in areas where social distancing isn’t possible. Officials say the most effective homemade masks should fit snugly and be made of thick cloth. RELATED: To fight COVID-19, CDC now says wear masks in public A comparison between masks is flawed for a couple of reasons.  First, the N95, and other medical masks, are in high demand and officials say they should be reserved for health care workers who are in direct contact with infected patients.  Second, multiple studies that look at the efficacy of lower-grade fabric masks have shown that they, too, help block particles.  ""The protection from cloth masks isn’t 0, and it’s definitely not 100, but the way to think about any of the masks and our overall approach is how do you put together all the pieces of the puzzle to give you a complete picture of minimizing the risk of transmission of COVID-19?"" said Dr. Thomas Tsai, a surgeon and health policy researcher at Harvard’s school of public health. ""Hand washing, wearing masks, and social distancing is part of it, but none of them alone. It’s how you put together these different tools to meet the task at hand. Wearing any mask is a very, very small price to pay to be safe and return to society."" Linsey Marr, an expert in airborne disease transmission at Virginia Tech, told PolitiFact that masks provide some protection but the amount can vary widely depending on the type and how it's worn. Masks reduce the amount of virus spread and also the amount one might inhale, she said.  It’s not true, she said, that cloth masks provide 0% protection. ""There have been measurements showing that homemade mask materials offer up to 80% protection,"" Marr said, ""which is much better than 0%, although not as good as an N95. Still, reducing the amount of virus that we inhale by 80% is better than nothing."" A smattering of studies have looked at the efficacy of different masks in different ways. One experiment from researchers at the National Institutes of Health used lasers to illuminate and measure how many droplets of saliva were released into the air by a person talking with and without a cloth facial covering.  As can be seen in a video of the experiment, a cluster of droplets appear in the air when the researcher speaks without a mask, but nearly all the particles are blocked when he does the same with a mask. The study didn’t capture micro-droplets, and more research needs to be done on how many viral particles these smaller droplets can contain, but it demonstrated that a cloth mask is better than no mask. Scientists from the University of Hong Kong’s School of Public Health conducted a study in patients with seasonal coronaviruses. The report found that surgical face masks significantly reduced detection of viral RNA in aerosols and shows a trend in reducing viral RNA in respiratory droplets. Arizona State University mathematicians recently developed a model for assessing the community impact of mask use by the general, asymptomatic public. That study found that a broad adoption of even relatively ineffective face masks ""may meaningfully reduce community transmission of COVID-19 and decrease peak hospitalizations and deaths,"" and said masks are useful to both prevent illness in healthy persons and prevent asymptomatic transmission. ""Typical protection (of fabric masks) is probably at least 50%, high quality masks could be 80–95% protective, and even low quality masks made of very thin materials could still be 10–20% protective,"" said Steffen Eikenberry, a postdoctoral scholar in the school of mathematical and statistical sciences and one of the main authors of the study. ""While evidence is still very limited, several laboratory studies indicate that the majority of homemade mask materials, including cotton fabric, cotton T-shirts, tea cloth, flannel, silk, linen, scarves, and chiffon offer at least 50% protection. Higher quality, more tightly woven fabrics are better, and multiple layers improves protection."" Jeremy Howard, a data scientist at the University of San Francisco, wrote an article in the Conversation in favor of universal mask wearing. Howard says that researchers were looking at the wrong question at first – how well a mask protects the wearer from infection – and not how well a mask prevents an infected person from spreading the virus. He said masks function very differently as personal protective equipment versus ""source control."" ""Masks are very good at blocking larger droplets and not nearly as good at blocking tiny particles,"" he wrote. ""When a person expels droplets into the air, they quickly evaporate and shrink to become tiny airborne particles called droplet nuclei. These are extremely hard to remove from the air. However, in the moist atmosphere between a person’s mouth and their mask, it takes nearly a hundred times as long for a droplet to evaporate and shrink into a droplet nuclei."" He continued: ""This means that nearly any kind of simple cloth mask is great for source control. The mask creates humidity, this humidity prevents virus-containing droplets from turning into droplet nuclei, and this allows the fabric of the mask to block the droplets."" Social media posts claim that certain face masks are ineffective and provide ""0% protection."" More research needs to be done but we found that medical experts widely refute the claim. Higher medical-grade masks offer the most protection, but homemade masks are also effective, particularly when they fit snuggly and are made of multiple layers. No mask is 100% effective, but health care officials stress that face masks increase their effectiveness when combined with other measures, such as social distancing and regular hand washing. We rate this False.  ",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFCBA4C0>],/factchecks/2020/may/18/facebook-posts/face-masks-including-homemade-ones-are-effective-c/

Reopened Florida beach leads to more trash
","As Floridians have returned to the beaches after shutdown orders were lifted, they have been leaving behind garbage. ""Beachgoers trash Florida beaches with 13,000 pounds of litter after beaches reopen,"" stated a headline on the Truththeory website and posted on Facebook May 12, 2020. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) But in this case, the Facebook post has some truth to it. We found that the number of 13,000 pounds was correct, however it would have been more accurate to refer to the materials as ""garbage"" rather than ""litter"" because some of it was found in trash bins. Also, it was a reference to one specific beach in the state, as explained in the story. The Facebook post cites a May 9 article by Florida Today about the amount of garbage found on Cocoa Beach once restrictions were lifted. Starting in late March and then April, the city of Cocoa Beach posted rules that significantly limited use of the beach including the hours, parking and group sizes. But in recent weeks those rules were loosened -- and that’s when the garbage piled up. The city has a contract with Keep Brevard Beautiful to pick up litter on about a five-mile stretch of Cocoa Beach. Typically, they collect  between 30 and 50 bags per day, executive director Bryan Bobbitt told PolitiFact. Each bag weighs 40 to 50 pounds. On Friday, May 1, the organization collected about 33 bags. That grew to 122 bags on Saturday and 142 on Sunday.  In total over that weekend, about 13,560 pounds of garbage was removed, City Manager James McKnight told PolitiFact. Most of the trash was in trash cans or bagged next to trash cans, he said, however a significant amount was picked up directly from the beach itself.  The police department announced it would fine violators $250 for littering. A headline said ""beachgoers trash Florida beaches with 13,000 pounds of litter after beaches reopen.""  That referred to the amount of garbage collected during the first weekend in May at Cocoa Beach. It was the amount of garbage collected from trash bins as well as from the beach, which means it wasn’t all improperly discarded litter.

No spike tied to voting, but data leaves questions
","During a video interview with the Texas Tribune, U.S. Rep. Chip Roy, a Republican from Austin, discussed the status of coronavirus in the state and spoke about a number of policies under consideration — including whether mail-in voting should be expanded for the general election in November. Citing concerns about voter fraud, Roy said it doesn’t make sense to ""flip our system on its head and convert to all, or significant, mail voting"" or online voting. Instead, he said state officials should be able to find a way to make in-person voting safe by the time the November election rolls around. He pointed to Wisconsin as evidence that in-person voting could be safe, even during a pandemic. Wisconsin’s presidential primary election was held April 7, after a legal fight and much public debate about whether it was safe for voters to go to the polls in the middle of the pandemic. ""If you look at Wisconsin, I’ve yet to see a spike or anything (in coronavirus cases) that anybody has said was statistically significant related to the fact that they had voting,"" Roy said.  Evan Smith, chief executive officer of the Texas Tribune, interjected and said: ""In fact, the Wisconsin Health Department said that 36 people at least are believed to have gotten the virus as a consequence of voting in person. There has been reporting on this."" Roy replied: ""I’ve looked at that report and I’ve looked at studies and I’ve not seen any significant study that has shown a spike as a result of their election. By the way, that was in the heat of the initial outbreak a few weeks ago. What we’re talking about is laying out a system where this can work, and we’ve got until November to do it."" PolitiFact Wisconsin has examined other claims related to its election, but is it true that there was no statistically significant spike in COVID-19 cases as a result of the election? Roy’s office did not return a request for comment. Tracking cases In the weeks since April 7, health experts in Wisconsin have attempted to track the number of COVID-19 cases with links to the election.  The tally includes people who tested positive for COVID-19 after April 9 who reported having voted in person or who worked at the polls on the day of the election. The tally does not include people who voted or worked the polls but started to display symptoms after April 21. As of May 7, Wisconsin had identified 67 people who fit this criteria, according to Jennifer Miller, spokeswoman for the Wisconsin Department of Health Services. But that does not guarantee that these individuals contracted the virus while voting, a point state health officials have emphasized. In an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (a PolitiFact Wisconsin partner), Darren Rausch, lead for the Milwaukee County COVID-19 Epidemiology Intel Team, said the election’s timing makes it difficult to link cases to the voting. ""What complicated our analysis is also included in this time frame is both the Easter and Passover holiday weekends, and both of those included the opportunity for significant breaches of the safer-at-home order,"" he said. ""So that was complicating our work from the beginning."" In total, Wisconsin had reported 8,901 cumulative positive coronavirus tests on May 6, when Roy made this statement. That total includes 335 new cases recorded that day. On election day, an estimated 413,000 people voted in person across Wisconsin, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. Experts said a surge tied to the election would have appeared in statewide data at the end of April, given the incubation period of the coronavirus. But, no surge appeared. One factor could be mitigation efforts in place across the state at the time, as cellphone data analyzed by researchers showed residents complying with stay-at-home orders in the week after the election. Since then, the number of cases linked to the election increased from about 40 to 67. Dr. Ryan Westergaard, the chief medical officer at the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, said there is reason to believe the election did expose some individuals to the virus, but there is not enough data to point towards a statewide trend. ""With the data we have, we can't prove an association,"" Westergaard said in an interview with the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. ""It would be speculative to say that was definitely the cause without really investigating closely and being clear that somebody really had no other potential exposure to infected people. I don’t think we have the resources to really do that to know definitely."" Public figures have repeatedly tried to connect trends in coronavirus cases in Wisconsin with the election, but other factors have impacted the data. On April 22, the state saw a spike in cases, but the spike was tied to outbreaks at meatpacking plants in the state — not the election. A different spike, identified earlier in April, was due to a change in the number of tests being administered. Facebook posts suggested that the state was seeing more cases, but this was due to a dip in the number of tests administered and a subsequent increase in testing. Our ruling Roy said Wisconsin has not had a spike in coronavirus cases that was ""statistically significant related to the fact that they had voting."" Wisconsin has linked 67 coronavirus cases to the April 7 primary election in the state, a small fraction of the state’s total cases. But the data is limited. Health officials said there is significant uncertainty surrounding these figures, and the election’s true impact might be impossible to determine. We rate this claim Mostly True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809749EB00>],/factchecks/2020/may/18/chip-roy/no-spike-tied-voting-data-leaves-questions/

Fact-checking Trump’s claim that Gov. Tom Wolf is keeping ‘barely affected' parts of Pa. closed
","After touring an Allentown warehouse filled with protective medical equipment, President Donald Trump criticized Gov. Tom Wolf for keeping parts of Pennsylvania closed that the president thinks are no longer threatened by the coronavirus. ""You have areas of Pennsylvania that are barely affected and [the governor wants] to keep them closed,"" Trump told a crowd of workers from Owens & Minor, a company that manufactures and distributes masks, gloves and gowns to health care workers, on May 14. We wondered whether the statewide stay-at-home order Wolf issued on April 1 still applies to places hardly impacted by the deadly disease. It all depends what criteria are used to determine whether the coronavirus still poses a threat. The virus is still raging across Southeastern Pennsylvania, and not even Trump is arguing that Philadelphia and its suburbs are ready to reopen. Officials in Delaware and Bucks counties, however, have asked Wolf to exclude their nursing-home populations when he eventually rates their readiness.  ""Largely when you look across the state, the hardest hit area has been the Southeast of Pennsylvania,"" said Dr. David Rubin, director of PolicyLab at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia, which has been tracking the differences in the outbreak across individual regions of the country. The Philadelphia area as far west as Lancaster, Berks and Dauphin counties, and north to the Lehigh Valley have seen some of the worst outbreaks in Pennsylvania, he said. ""Largely the rest of the state has had a pretty deceptively, sort of minimal experience with COVID,"" Rubin said. That includes Allegheny County, the rural ""T"" and the South, Central and Southwestern parts of the state. ""When you have someone in that area of the state that are upset that they are unable to work, they’re not wrong,"" Rubin said. But for those in the Southeast worried about a resurgence, ""they’re not wrong, either."" Wolf has already moved 37 Pennsylvania counties into what he calls the ‘yellow’ phase of reopening.  In these places, many businesses may resume in-person operations, and residents may leave their homes so long as they take precautions. Thirteen counties in Southwestern Pennsylvania moved into the yellow phase May 15. Twenty-four others in the Northern half of the state entered yellow May 8. Another 12 counties will move into yellow on May 22.  Counties in the red phase of Wolf’s reopening plan are still under lockdown, with stay-at-home orders in place and all but ‘essential’ businesses closed. Counties that eventually make it to the green phase will ask businesses and individuals to follow Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and State Department of Health guidelines for limiting the spread of the virus but will otherwise have no restrictions.  Yellow counties’ gyms, hair salons, and schools must remain closed, and gatherings of more than 25 people are prohibited. Even still, yellow is the distinction several other Central and Eastern Pennsylvania counties are clamoring for. A key factor that determines whether a county qualifies for yellow privileges is whether it has fewer than 50 new reported coronavirus cases per 100,000 residents over a period of 14 days. The number of people sickened with the virus in Lancaster, Lebanon, Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties disqualifies them from entering the yellow phase. But that fact didn’t stop local leaders from announcing plans to reopen businesses anyway – with or without Wolf’s blessing. In a series of letters and tweets, the officials, including state lawmakers and county commissioners, begged Wolf to allow local businesses to reopen and better position themselves to survive the crisis. Officials from Dauphin, Franklin and Schuylkill counties later backed down. Lebanon officials are set to vote on reopening today. Lancaster officials held a news conference on the issue Thursday night but did not say what they will do. Counties reversed course after Wolf called them ‘cowardly’ and ‘selfish’ and threatened to withhold their federal stimulus funds if they directed businesses and residents to defy his order. Until recently, another nine counties found themselves in limbo. They had reported fewer than 50 cases per 100,000 residents over a 14-day period, but until May 15, when Wolf announced plans to move them into the yellow phase soon, they remained stuck in the red zone, which requires businesses to stay closed and residents to continue sheltering at home. Those counties include: York, Adams, Perry, Juniata, Mifflin, Carbon, Wyoming, Susquehanna and Wayne. Officials from York and Adams counties had been especially vocal about their frustration that businesses had not been cleared to reopen. Some officials said they didn’t understand what was holding them back, given their success keeping coronavirus case counts relatively low. Wolf had been asked about the discrepancy several times in recent days before he announced plans to move the counties into yellow by May 22, and his explanations lacked clarity. We had to read a 7,000 word Wolf administration document titled ""Process to Reopen Pennsylvania"" to figure it out. A county’s coronavirus case count is not the only piece of information Wolf’s team uses to determine when it’s ready to move into the yellow phase. He’s said this publicly, but on recent calls with the press, he hasn’t listed the other factors that matter. Carnegie Mellon University researchers advising the state compiled the list and rated counties in each category. According to the document, the other factors are: A county’s ability to meet a surge in demand for intensive care. A county’s density. The share of county residents who are over age 60. The share of county residents who work in ""physically closed"" industry sectors, such as nursing homes.    When those pieces are considered, it appears York County was held back from reopening because of its population density, and Adams County was ordered to stay closed because it has an insufficient number of intensive care unit beds. Mifflin, Juniata, Perry, Carbon, Susquehanna and Wayne counties were also flagged because of limited ICU capacity. We had to click through a link tucked at the bottom of a May 8 press release to find a May 7 PowerPoint presentation detailing how each Pennsylvania county rates on the Carnegie Mellon risk assessment scale. It’s unclear if county officials calling to have their stay-at-home orders lifted know where to find their own ratings. Wyoming County in the Northeast corner of the state has a small number of coronavirus cases and doesn’t rate as high risk in any of the other categories. Before Wolf announced that Wyoming County would move into the yellow phase by May 22, it was unclear why Wolf wouldn’t allow businesses there to reopen. County officials had announced plans to reopen without Wolf’s approval and later backed down.  In the ""Process to Reopen Pennsylvania"" document, the state cautioned that the reopening process will be fluid and that the Carnegie Mellon rating system is not designed to ""make decisions but rather to inform decision makers."" Trump said that Wolf wants to keep parts of Pennsylvania closed that have been ""barely affected"" by the coronavirus. Trump was likely speaking about counties in Central and Eastern Pennsylvania like Lebanon and Lancaster whose Republican lawmakers have been clamoring for more freedom even though their coronavirus case counts remain relatively high. Those places have not been ""barely affected."" They’re battling active outbreaks. Trump was right, though, that until May 15, Wolf wanted to keep closed nine counties with relatively few cases. For these reasons, we rate Trump’s statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F57C80>],/factchecks/2020/may/18/donald-trump/fact-checking-trumps-claim-gov-tom-wolf-keeping-pa/

Yes, dentists were essential under Wisconsin’s Safer At Home order.
","Amid the political upheaval over when and how and how fast to reopen Wisconsin, there was a point on May 11, 2020, when Gov Tony Evers relaxed his stay-at-home order to allow small retail establishments to reopen, so long as they limited shoppers to five or fewer. The state Supreme Court later voted 4-3 to toss out Evers’ order entirely, saying his administration had to work with the GOP-controlled Legislature on any continued restrictions. In the wake of Evers’ May 11 action, state Rep. Janel Brandtjen, R-Menomonee Falls, offered this tweet targeted at Evers: @Gov Evers liquor stores are open, strip malls can have 5 customers, but dentists are non-essential?! Is she right? Were dentists considered non-essential under the safer-at-home order? The short answer: No. Let’s start with the order itself: Executive Order #28.  Under Section 13, essential businesses include healthcare and public health operations. And, elsewhere within the order, dental offices are classified under healthcare and as public health operations. So, that order did not block dentists from seeing patients. Meanwhile, an online map from the American Dental Association that tracks the extent to which dentists nationwide have been able to offer services shows the vast majority of states, including Wisconsin, allowing elective and emergency procedures. Of those, as of May 14, 2020, the map showed seven states allowing only emergency procedures. (No state had dentist offices closed entirely.) Beyond that, Wisconsin is listed among only four states – including California, Rhode Island, and Delaware – that explicitly designated dentists as essential. That said, the American Dental Association has recommended dentists remain open only for emergency procedures and postpone elective procedures. And the Wisconsin Dental Association follows ADA recommendations. Similarly, the state Department of Health Services recommends dentists follow guidelines from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which include postponing elective procedures and non-emergency visits.  So, on a practical level, many dentist offices held off on doing routine visits, such as cleanings and checkups. But that was due to their own choice, and consistent with guidelines from dental groups and health agencies. It was not forbidden under Evers’ order. When asked for backup for the claim that dentists were deemed nonessential, Brandtjen didn’t cite the order itself. Rather, in an email, she said Wisconsin dentists planned to start opening their offices in early May, but claimed the state Department of Health Services notified the Dentistry Examining Board that those who did could put their licenses in jeopardy. Jennifer Garrett, communications director for the Department of Safety and Professional Services, said examining board members were advised by legal counsel May 6, 2020, that dentists should follow DHS guidelines, and could face penalties if they did not.  But, as evidence, that is off point, particularly with such a narrow claim.  As noted, the Evers order declared dentists essential — the opposite of what Brandtjen claimed. Brandtjen tweeted that under orders from Evers, dentists were classified as non-essential, and therefore had to remain closed. But Evers’ order — unlike those from many other governors — explicitly declared dentists, like other health care workers, were essential. Thus, they were allowed to stay open, even if many chose to limit their offerings to emergency work. We rate Brandtjen’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3C6600>],/factchecks/2020/may/15/janel-brandtjen/yes-dentists-were-essential-under-wisconsins-safer/

Claim that federal contact tracing bill is not for COVID-19 is false
","Proposed legislation in the U.S. House would provide new funding for testing and contract tracing to help public-health officials track and control the spread of the coronavirus. But a Facebook post claims that the $100 billion bill ""is about controlling/tracking population, not about coronavirus."" The May 12 post, which had more than 100,000 views by the next day, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The $100 billion is strictly targeted to fight COVID-19. It would fund not only contact tracing, a process aimed at stopping the spread of the disease, but also COVID-19 testing and services for people isolating at home. Contact tracing has become a key strategy of the White House plan to reopen states that went into shutdown because of the coronavirus pandemic. The process tasks public health workers with learning as much as they can about whom a patient has been in contact with, so they can be notified about their potential exposure. While it does raise some privacy concerns, contact tracing has been used to slow the spread of other diseases, such as SARS and HIV. It’s a common strategy in public health agencies across the country. State and local public health officials are hiring thousands of new contact tracers, but some experts say the federal government needs to spend billions of dollars to bolster those efforts. The claim about the proposed legislation is made by former television news reporter Ben Swann, who describes himself as a ""journalist who speaks truth to power!"" He runs TruthInMedia.com, which says it provides ""content focusing on issues that impact humanity."" The headline of Swann’s post is: ""H.R. 6666: $100 Billion Contact Tracing Bill is About Controlling/Tracking Population, Not About Coronavirus."" The post says:  ""A House resolution from Illinois Democrat Rep. Bobby Rush that would put Big Government in charge of tracking citizens’ movements as they relate to COVID-19 mitigation efforts — even sending health bureaucrats to ‘individuals’ residences, as necessary,’ as the legislation states."" That wording is nearly the same as the first paragraph of a Washington Times article that’s labeled opinion/analysis and was published the same day as the Facebook post. The post also includes a 15-minute video in which Swann claims the bill would create ""a massive new surveillance structure in this country.""  In the video, which we did not fact-check, Swann argues that contact tracing is useful only in the early stages of an outbreak and now ""is completely useless"" in the United States because ""a massive amount of the population have been exposed to the disease."" Based on that, Swann argues that the contact tracing supported by the bill would be done to ""monitor you in your own home, traced in your home, your associations monitored, your movements monitored."" H.R. 6666 was introduced by Rush on May 1 and is called the COVID-19 Testing, Reaching, And Contacting Everyone Act, or TRACE Act. It would provide $100 billion in grants in the current fiscal year to faith-based organization, clinics, medical centers and other organizations that: Perform testing for COVID–19; Do contact tracing; or  Provide services for individuals who are isolating at home.  The bill would ""authorize the Secretary of Health and Human Services to award grants to eligible entities to conduct diagnostic testing for COVID–19, and related activities such as contact tracing, through mobile health units and, as necessary, at individuals’ residences, and for other purposes."" Swann told PolitiFact that the ""other purposes"" wording ""leaves room for interpretation and expansion.""  A Facebook post claims new federal legislation to support COVID-19 testing and contact tracing ""is about controlling/tracking population, not about coronavirus."" The bill strictly targets the novel coronavirus. It would provide $100 billion to organizations that do COVID-19 testing or contact tracing or that provide services to people who are isolating at home.

Yes, payments to dairy farmers have dropped even as retail milk prices rise
","The coronavirus pandemic has been especially unkind to the already staggering dairy industry. Plunging demand from restaurants and schools and an inability to quickly shift processing to meet new categories of demand has left farmers dumping milk on a massive scale. But at least milk prices are going up, right? That’s not exactly a help, one dairy farmer said in a widely-shared Facebook post. ""The price consumers pay at retail for a gallon of milk has gone up 7.5% since this time last year,"" Pennsylvania farmer Greg Hemsarth said in a May 2, 2020, post that was shared more than 3,500 times. ""The price farmers are paid has dropped 23%. Figure that one out."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Are farmers really getting paid less even as retail milk prices go up? Let’s dive into the data behind this dairy dichotomy. For starters, connecting any pair of dots to explain milk pricing is tricky. This post referenced liquid milk prices, but only 30% of the milk produced in the U.S. is actually sold in liquid form, said Michael Nepveux, an economist with the American Farm Bureau Federation. ""While we may see fluid milk flying off grocery shelves and wonder why farmers are having to dump milk, it must be remembered that many of these other products rely heavily on the foodservice and restaurant sector,"" he said. And farmer’s pricing is part of a system that is complex to say the least. RELATED: Are bottling limitations on liquid milk to blame for milk dumping? Nepveux spent nearly 2,000 words and a handful of charts detailing how pricing works in a primer the Farm Bureau posted in June 2019. It started this way: ""There’s an old adage in the dairy industry that ‘only five people in the world know how milk is priced in the U.S. – and four of them are dead.’"" Milk payments to farmers are influenced by commodity prices, geography and whether the milk is being used for liquid sales, yogurt, cheese, butter, etc. We started with Hemsarth himself. Though the numbers in the post are stated generally, he told PolitiFact Wisconsin he was actually referring only to his own observations. Hemsarth was comparing the price of milk at a grocer in Bloomsburg, Penn., to a picture he took of the milk case a year prior. And he was looking at payments he received for milk he sold compared to a year ago. Given the generic wording and wide sharing of this post, most readers likely assumed it referenced some broader dataset, at either the state or national level. So let’s check those datapoints. National data shows the trend Hemsarth highlighted isn’t confined to his corner of the world. Prices paid to farmers have dropped even as retail prices rose. The retail price for a gallon of milk averaged $3.27 in April, according to the latest data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. That’s up 9.6% from the April 2019 mark ($2.98). Data provided by Dairy Management Inc., a group funded by farmers to help increase sales of dairy products, shows a nearly identical comparison. They reported a national average of $3.11 as of mid-April, compared to $2.83 a year prior. That’s an increase of 9.9%.  A state-level breakdown showed a year-over-year increase in all but one state. The largest jump was in Ohio — more than 28%. Pennsylvania prices increased 9.5%, and Wisconsin was up 8.7%. So, on that part of the equation, the post was in the ballpark — actually understating the magnitude of the retail increase nationally. On the farm payment side, Hemsarth reported a milk payment drop of 23%. The Farm Bureau, using U.S. Department of Agriculture data, reported a 21.1% drop in the price paid to farmers in May 2020 compared to May 2019. Nepveux said that is based on Class 1 fluid milk, the highest valued class of milk. A month earlier, in April, farmers were seeing payments 5.6% higher than the year prior. May is the first month where 2020 was lower than that month in 2019, though prices have fallen each month since December. May milk prices dropped because the formula relies heavily on commodity prices, and those dropped sharply in April, Nepveux said. A viral Facebook post said retail milk prices are up 7.5% from last year while the price paid to farmers dropped 23%. The farmer who provided these numbers was just referencing payments for the milk he sold and prices at a local grocer, but the trends are in line with what we see nationally. Nationwide, retail milk prices in April were up nearly 10% from the prior year, while the price paid to farmers dropped sharply in May to about 21% below the prior year. The comparison oversimplifies things a bit, since the majority of milk produced in the U.S. isn’t sold in liquid form. And the specific numbers aren’t exactly right. But the general point is. We rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975AD200>],/factchecks/2020/may/15/facebook-posts/yes-payments-dairy-farmers-have-dropped-even-retai/

Some members of the Taliban say they will not deny women and girls education or the right to work.

Mich. lawmaker falsely claims previous infection protects him from COVID-19 ‘forever’
","Michigan’s Senate GOP leader Mike Shirkey voiced his frustration with a vaccine mandate that will be in place during a major policy conference in the resort town of Mackinac Island in September. While Shirkey said he plans to be on Mackinac during the conference, he said he can’t participate in it because he refuses to get a COVID-19 vaccine. Shirkey said he doesn’t need to get vaccinated because he was previously infected with COVID-19. ""I don’t need it. I have natural immunity,"" Shirkey said in an interview Aug. 16 with Jackson TV, a local channel in his hometown. And that protection lasts ""forever,"" Shirkey said in response to a question from JTV host Bart Hawley. Challenged by Hawley on that point, Shirkey acknowledged that the research is inconclusive, but then said, ""there’s strong evidence to suggest it’s lifelong."" Shirkey’s comment ignores the fact that reinfections do happen among unvaccinated individuals who have recovered from COVID-19. And his comment contradicts the recommendation of health experts who say that the vaccines offer greater protection from reinfection than any immunity developed from a previous COVID-19 infection. This is not the first time Shirkey has made misleading claims about the coronavirus. Shirkey suggested in early May that Michigan had achieved herd immunity by virtue of the vaccinated population and those previously infected with COVID-19. Medical experts disputed Shirkey’s math, which was based on a rough calculation of likely COVID-19 cases, and they said the state was far from reaching the level of vaccination needed to limit the spread of COVID-19. Shirkey was infected with COVID-19 in December 2020. He appeared on the floor of the Michigan House of Representatives two days before Dec. 23, when his spokesperson said he tested positive for COVID-19. Footage of the Dec. 21 proceedings shows him removing his mask at times and interacting with others. He disclosed the infection in mid-January, and described his case as ""mild"" during a January interview. Research into how long natural immunity lasts is ongoing, but findings to date do not support Shirkey’s assertion that he has lifelong immunity that offers the same level of protection as the vaccine. People who have had COVID-19 are known to develop some immunity, but experts don’t know how long that immunity lasts. One study published in Science in February found that immunity can last up to eight months after infection. Another study published in Nature in June found protection remained strong for up to a year. That same study also found that vaccination strongly boosts the immune system’s response to the virus. A study published in Nature in May 2021 found that individuals infected with COVID-19 could produce antibodies throughout their lives. But Dr. Ali Ellebedy, an associate professor of pathology and immunology at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis who led the study, said those previously infected ""should definitely get vaccinated."" He said during a May interview with WBUR that antibodies against COVID-19 from natural immunity may not offer sufficient protection against reinfection, especially in the face of new variants. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention also recommends that those who have been previously infected with COVID-19 get vaccinated. The recommendation was bolstered by a recent CDC study out of Kentucky that found that vaccination offers significantly greater protection against reinfection than natural immunity. Those who were unvaccinated were more than twice as likely to be reinfected than those who were fully vaccinated, the study found. Health experts say that with new strains of the virus circulating, getting vaccinated is all the more important. ""Your natural infection will provide protection against whatever (strain) you were naturally infected with, but now there's a different virus circulating,"" Dr. Paul Offit, chair of vaccinology at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine, told PolitiFact. ""So by getting a vaccine, you'll have a broader immune response to a more diverse population of SARS-CoV-2 viruses."" As the delta variant has led to a spike in COVID-19 cases, the CDC has continued to urge more Americans to get vaccinated, including those previously infected with COVID-19. ""If you have had COVID-19 before, please still get vaccinated,"" said CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky in response to research showing that people who have recovered from COVID-19 face significantly greater risk of reinfection if they’re unvaccinated. ""Getting the vaccine is the best way to protect yourself and others around you, especially as the more contagious delta variant spreads around the country."" A spokesperson for Shirkey didn’t say what evidence he was citing for his claim of lifelong protection, but said he objected to a policy that emphasized proof of vaccination rather than proof of immunity. ""The focus should be on an individual’s antibodies to the virus, not just whether they had a vaccine,"" Shirkey’s chief of staff Jeremy Hendges told PolitiFact, adding: ""There are obviously questions about how long the vaccines are effective."" Shirkey claimed that he does not need to get vaccinated because the ""natural immunity"" from his previous COVID-19 infection lasts ""forever."" While one study found that those previously infected with COVID-19 may produce antibodies throughout their lives, the study’s lead author still recommended getting vaccinated because there is no conclusive evidence that natural immunity provides the same level of protection of the vaccines, especially in the face of new variants. Public health experts have found that getting vaccinated strongly enhances the immune response to COVID-19 among those previously infected. We rate Shirkey’s claim False.

Posts correct about Trump administration’s role in releasing key Taliban leader
","As the Taliban celebrated its rapid takeover of Afghanistan, blame for the fall of the U.S.-backed Afghan government and military ricocheted around social media.  Critics of President Joe Biden noted that he was in charge as the U.S. struggled to evacuate a flood of Americans and others who wanted to exit the country. Meanwhile, critics of President Donald Trump responded that his administration had set the endgame in motion by striking a deal with the Taliban to withdraw U.S. forces by this year. Several posts highlighted the role of Trump’s secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, such as one on Instagram that featured a photograph along with this caption: ""Guy next to @mikepompeo here in November of 2020 is the guy the Trump administration helped get out of jail in 2018 and who is now the 'president' of Afghanistan.""  Did the Trump administration really help a top Taliban figure get out of jail? Basically yes, although it's too early to say he whether he will become leader of the Taliban’s government in Kabul. The man pictured meeting with Pompeo in 2020 is Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar. He was a founder of the Taliban, which led a repressive regime that ruled Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001 and provided sanctuary to al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden.  In 2001, when the Taliban’s control of Afghanistan was weakening under pressure from a U.S.-backed offensive, Baradar tried to persuade leaders of his group to surrender. Taliban leaders rebuffed his suggestion. In 2010, Baradar was captured by the United States and was imprisoned in Pakistan until 2018. During that time, however, officials inside and outside Afghanistan considered him one of the few Taliban leaders who they might be able to negotiate with. In 2018, as negotiations to end the Afghanistan war were taking shape, the Trump administration urged Pakistan to release Baradar. He would become the head of the Taliban’s political office in Doha, Qatar, from which he would participate in the negotiations. The United States’ special envoy for the talks, Zalmay Khalilzad, confirmed the U.S. role in releasing Baradar in remarks at the U.S. Institute of Peace on Feb. 8, 2019. His release ""was my request,"" Khalilzad said at the Institute of Peace forum. The Pakistani government ""accommodated that,"" he said. Pompeo and his department made no secret about negotiating with Baradar. Using his government account, Pompeo tweeted a photograph from one of their meetings on Sept. 12, 2020, and the State Department issued a press release on the meeting, saying ""Secretary Pompeo urged the Taliban to seize this opportunity to forge a political settlement and reach a comprehensive and permanent ceasefire."" (The photograph in the Instagram post appears to be of a different session between the two men, on Nov. 21, 2020.) Met with Taliban Political Deputy Mullah Beradar to welcome the launch of Afghan peace negotiations. The Taliban must seize this opportunity to forge a political settlement & reach a comprehensive & permanent ceasefire to end 40 years of war. This effort must be Afghan led. pic.twitter.com/i7AUlGsBGz The talks produced an agreement for the U.S. to withdraw its troops by May 1, 2021. Biden largely stuck to the Trump-negotiated agreement, but delayed the deadline until Sept. 11, 2021. U.S. troops began to depart in May. The one exaggeration in the Instagram post is that Baradar is ""‘president' of Afghanistan."" While the Wall Street Journal reported that Baradar ""is the highest-ranking leader of the movement to appear in public since it took back control of Afghanistan,"" the newspaper added that ""the Taliban haven’t said who will lead their movement, or how their government will operate."" The Washington Post referred to him as the Taliban’s ""de facto leader."" News reports suggest that there’s at least one figure above Baradar in the Taliban’s organizational chart: Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, who has been referred to as the group’s ""supreme leader."" As of Aug. 17, Akhundzada had not yet emerged in public, Axios reported. ""The Taliban have not yet said who will be leading their new government, much less what the titles will be,"" said Laurel Miller, director of the Asia Program at the International Crisis Group, though she added that ""it would not be surprising for Baradar to take up a senior position."" An Instagram post said, ""Guy next to @mikepompeo here in November of 2020 is the guy the Trump administration helped get out of jail in 2018 and who is now the 'president' of Afghanistan."" As secretary of state, Pompeo tweeted a photo of himself at negotiations with Baradar, and the U.S. envoy chosen by Trump publicly confirmed that he requested Baradar’s release from prison in Pakistan. However, it’s too early to say that Baradar will be ""president"" of Afghanistan, since no such decision has been publicly announced.

"['Education', 'Virginia', 'Glenn Youngkin']","
McAuliffe helped ease school accreditation standards as governor
","Republican gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin says Virginia’s public education has suffered in recent years and puts some of the blame on Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe, who led the state from 2014 to 2018. ""We watched Terry McAuliffe, when he was governor, lower the standards in our schools so that schools that weren’t being accredited could now be accredited,"" Youngkin said during an Aug. 6 radio interview on the conservative John Fredericks Show. We looked into Youngkin’s claim and found McAuliffe made it much easier for schools to win state accreditation. In fact, no Virginia school has been denied accreditation since McAuliffe-backed changes went into effect at the start of the 2018-19 school year. But what Youngkin calls a lowering of standards, McAuliffe calls a long-awaited reform that added fairness to the accreditation process and that, in principle, received bipartisan legislative support. Their disagreement is an issue in the gubernatorial race. For years, Virginia accreditation was based almost entirely on what percentage of students passed state standardized tests - called the Standards of Learning.  Supporters said the tests hold students and schools accountable for a base level of achievement and let the public know how each school is performing. Opponents said the assessments put teachers under pressure to craft rote lessons around the tests at the expense of encouraging critical thinking. They argue that basing accreditation off the tests stigmatized students and schools, often in low-income areas, that performed poorly. And they criticized the system for giving no credit to substandard schools with improving test scores. Strict standardized testing was a growing trend across the country in the 1990s and 2000s. But in 2012, a national coalition of educators, civil rights and parent groups began protesting the use of standardized tests in making high-stakes determinations such as school accreditation, teacher and principal evaluations and grade promotion. In Virginia, 30 local school boards signed a petition calling on the state to ease up on the SOL exams. McAuliffe pledged to deemphasize the tests and cut the number of them during his 2013 gubernatorial campaign. In 2015, the General Assembly overwhelmingly passed a bipartisan bill - which McAuliffe signed - directing the state Board of Education to devise new standards that ""recognize the progress of schools that do not meet accreditation benchmarks but have significantly improved their pass rates."" The law came to fruition in 2017 when the board, filled with McAuliffe appointees, enacted major changes to the accreditation process starting in the 2018-19 school year. The board added measures to determine whether a school is accredited, such as absenteeism, achievement gaps between students of different backgrounds and whether a school is showing improvement on the state exams. The board also lowered the number of standardized tests students must pass to graduate. Youngkin’s campaign sent us records of the board’s 2017 actions when asked for proof of its claim that McAuliffe lowered accreditation standards. Among other things, the campaign sent a 2020 editorial by The Washington Post headlined, ""Virginia made a mistake by easing its academic standards"" In 2018-19, the first year for the new standards, 92% of Virginia’s schools were fully accredited - up 6 percentage points from the previous year. No school was denied accreditation, compared to 88 schools the prior year.  The worst rating was ""accredited with conditions,"" given to 130 schools, or 7 percent of all schools.  Underperforming schools with that rating are given corrective plans and can only be denied accreditation if they don’t implement the remedial actions. No school was denied accreditation in 2019-20 as well; 132 were conditionally accredited. Virginia did not go through the rating process for the 2020-21 school year because of COVID-19.  Youngkin promises to rescind the accreditation reforms if he wins. ""On day one, I will sign an executive order returning Virginia to pre-McAuliffe standards,"" he wrote in his education platform. McAuliffe takes issue with the contention that standards dropped. ""To be clear: no standards were lowered,"" said Renzo Olivari, a campaign spokesman. ""The truth is that Terry worked with Republicans and Democrats to reform Virginia's accreditation process to help students succeed and better measure school progress and success."" Youngkin said, ""We watched Terry McAuliffe, when he was governor, lower the standards in our schools so that schools that weren’t being accredited could now be accredited."" Accreditation standards were eased during McAuliffe’s governorship. The plan was devised by his hand-picked state school board. Eighty-eight schools were denied accreditation the year before the reforms took effect. None have been denied certification since.  McAuliffe ran for governor in 2013 promising to deemphasize the state’s reliance on its  standardized tests in determining public schools’ accreditation. At least 30 local school boards demanded such reforms and the General Assembly overwhelmingly ordered it in 2015. So, the changes were not brought unilaterally by McAuliffe, as Youngkin suggests. There was a strong bipartisan calling. On the whole, we rate Youngkin’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097228600>],/factchecks/2021/aug/18/glenn-youngkin/mcauliffe-helped-ease-school-accreditation-standar/

Solar farms kill thousands of birds, but not as many as fossil fuel plants
","U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert criticized President Joe Biden’s infrastructure policy, saying it promotes green energy that poses a danger to birds. Gohmert, R-Texas, went on the One America News channel on Aug. 11 to criticize the infrastructure bill and compared its green energy provisions to the Green New Deal: ""Another part of that green deal is the huge solar farm that they have out on the border of California and Nevada. Thousands of acres of concave mirrors that magnify the sun toward three towers, heat up the liquid in there and turn turbines. They weren't anticipating that there would be hundreds and thousands of what they would call flamers because when the birds fly through, if they survive the windmills, then they hit that magnified sun, explode in flame and down, they go bird, guts all over the mirrors. So that takes some cleaning up. This is the green stuff that's just out of control and is going to bring the nation down"" We’ve fact-checked multiple claims about bird deaths and wind turbines, but this was the first time we heard a politician associate bird deaths with solar energy. Gohmert was likely referencing a 2014 article that described what workers at a Southern California solar power plant called ""streamers"" (not ""flamers""). The report about the Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System in California, a power plant that uses mirrors to concentrate the sun’s rays, said birds fly through its concentrated sun rays and ignite midair. Thousands of birds have died after flying over these kinds of solar power plants, but Gohmert’s assertion misses important context. ""It is wrong to single out solar and wind (power) as having bird mortality issues,"" said David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible Stewardship. ""The estimated number of birds killed by fossil fuel power plants through collisions, electrocution and poisoning actually dwarfs those attributed to solar and wind."" A 2016 study found that solar power plants cause 37,800 to 138,600 annual avian deaths in the U.S., compared with 14.5 million attributed to fossil fuel power plants. Another study attributed 365 million to 988 million avian deaths to collisions with buildings and windows. Experts said that most solar energy generated in the U.S. comes from photovoltaic panels, not concentrated solar power towers like the one at the Ivanpah plant that created the conditions that fatally harmed these birds. ""There are only two existing concentrated solar power tower projects in the U.S., and one of them recently went bankrupt,"" said Robyn Shepherd, a spokesperson for the National Audubon Society, a nonprofit dedicated to protecting birds and their habitats. While Gohmert is right that thousands of birds died at the Ivanpah plant, he implies that the potential deaths from the ""green stuff"" provisions in Biden’s infrastructure bill is a reason the House of Representatives should not pass it. But experts say that renewable energy has the benefit of reducing climate change, even when it has other consequences. ""All forms of human development have the potential for environmental impact, and renewable energy development is no exception, said ​​Leroy Walston, a leading environmental scientist at the Argonne National Laboratory and author of the study estimating avian deaths from solar power. Gohmert’s office declined to respond to questions about his claim. During the broadcast, Gohmert compared the bipartisan infrastructure bill to the Green New Deal, a comparison that PolitiFact rated Mostly False. Biden’s plan has a smaller scope than the Green New Deal, leaving out broader social goals like universal health care and affordable higher education. The cost and climate provisions of Biden’s plan allocate $73 billion to modernize the nation’s electricity grid so it can carry more renewable energy, according to The New York Times. Gohmert claimed hundreds and thousands of ""flamers"" die from solar farms. Birds have been found to ignite after flying over solar farms that use concentrated solar power. However, most solar farms in the U.S. use photovoltaic panels, which have not been found to cause birds to die in this manner. Gohmert’s claim ignores findings that show significantly more birds die from fossil fuel production or colliding with buildings each year.

Trump didn’t say he ‘trusted’ Taliban, but did plan earlier Afghanistan exit than Biden

""So many Republicans now blasting Biden for this exit didn’t say s*** last year when Trump actually said he trusted the Taliban and then set in motion an even earlier exit. I remember. Do you?"" The claim was by Occupy Democrats, an anti-Trump group that says it works with Democrats. It has 356,000 followers on Instagram and more than 10 million on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We did not find any instances in which Trump said he trusted the Taliban. An Occupy Democrats cofounder cited Trump statements about his optimism to make a deal with the Taliban. We searched Google, Nexis, a Trump Twitter archive and a database of Trump speeches, and contacted four experts. Trump did make an agreement with the Taliban that would have resulted in the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan before Biden ultimately withdrew the troops.  In a general sense, the U.S. was expecting that the Taliban would follow through with, for example, negotiating with the Afghanistan government, said Marvin Weinbaum, director of Afghanistan and Pakistan Studies at the Middle East Institute and a former Afghanistan specialist at the U.S. State Department. The agreement amounted to ""promises on their part and actual commitment on our part,"" he said. The United States had been in Afghanistan militarily since the 9/11 attacks almost 20 years ago. Here’s a timeline of recent events under Trump and Biden.  Feb. 29, 2020 — Trump makes U.S.-Taliban deal: The U.S. signed an agreement with the Taliban that paved the way for a phased withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan to conclude by May  2021, if certain conditions were met. The deal featured guarantees from the Taliban to ""prevent the use of the soil of Afghanistan by any group or individual against the security of the United States and its allies.""  In remarks about the deal, Trump expressed hope but reservations about the Taliban, saying of its leaders, ""We'll be very much hoping that they will be doing what they say they're going to be doing. They will be killing terrorists. They will be killing some very bad people. They will keep that fight going."" In a speech the same day, Trump reiterated his optimism but again stopped short of saying he trusted the Taliban. ""And if the Taliban and the Afghan government live up to their commitments — and they may or they may not, but I think we have a lot of reason why they will. I think they will,"" he said. Asked March 5, 2020, in a Fox News town hall if he could trust the Taliban, Trump didn’t directly answer the question. He gave a long response, starting with: ""So these are warriors. We've been there for 20 years. We're really serving more as a law enforcement group than a military group. We could win that war very easily but I don't feel like killing millions of people in order to do it. We don't want to do that, you don't want to do that, nobody wants to do that."" Sept. 18, 2020 — Trump praised Taliban: A year after Trump considered inviting the Taliban to Camp David for peace talks, he again expressed optimism but some wariness, saying: ""We’re dealing very well with the Taliban. They’re very tough. They’re very smart. They’re very sharp, but you know, it’s been 19 years and even they are tired of fighting, in all fairness."" He added: ""We’re having some very good discussions with the Taliban, as you probably heard. It’s been public. But we’ll be down to, very shortly, we’ll be down to less than 4,000 soldiers. We’ll be out of there, knowing that certain things have to happen. Certain things have to be fulfilled, but 19 years is a long time."" Nov. 17, 2020 — Trump announced troop reduction: Acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller announced that Trump had decided that by Jan. 15, 2021, the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan would be reduced from 5,000 to 2,500.  April 14, 2021 — Biden revised withdrawal plan: Biden announced that the May 1 deadline set by Trump’s U.S.-Taliban agreement would not be met, but that full withdrawal of troops would begin May 1 and end before Sept. 11. No conditions for the withdrawal were set.  July 8, 2021 — Military mission to end: Biden said the military mission in Afghanistan would end Aug. 31. By Aug. 16, the Afghanistan government had fallen to the Taliban. Occupy Democrats said that Trump in 2020 ""said he trusted the Taliban and then set in motion an even earlier exit"" from Afghanistan. We found no statements in which Trump said he trusted the Taliban. Trump signed a deal with the Taliban that, subject to conditions, would have resulted in the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan by May 2021, months before Biden’s withdrawal of the troops.  We rate the statement Half True.

Claim that Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is 42% effective leaves out key details
","With so much emphasis on vaccination to fight the coronavirus pandemic, it was startling to see one of the three vaccines used in the United States pegged as only 42% effective.  An Instagram post using that figure has spread widely on social media. The post is an image of a tweet by conservative activist Jack Posobiec. The tweet says: ""BREAKING: Biden Admin Concerned as Mayo Clinic Study Shows Pfizer Vaccine Dropped to 42% Effective."" A similar headline appears on an article in Human Events, where Posobiec is a senior editor.   The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found that it leaves out important context about the study and its findings. The Mayo Clinic study was posted Aug. 9 on a website for preprints. Preprint studies are preliminary, in that they have not yet been peer reviewed by other experts, and ""should not be used to guide clinical practice,"" says a notice posted with the study. The researchers compared the effectiveness of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines in the Mayo Clinic Health System (Arizona, Florida, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin) from January to July. (The Johnson & Johnson vaccine was not part of the study.) The researchers analyzed the records of adults who had received at least one dose of either vaccine and had not tested positive for COVID-19 prior to their first dose. Both the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines call for two doses. The study found the following: Overall, both vaccines were ""proven to reduce the burden of symptomatic disease, hospitalization, and death related to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This study further supports the effectiveness of both vaccines in doing so, even despite the evolution of more transmissible viral variants."" For preventing hospitalization, Moderna’s vaccine was 91.6% effective over the seven-month period, and Pfizer’s was 85% effective. For preventing infection, Moderna’s vaccine was 86% effective over the seven months, and Pfizer’s was 76% effective. What gained notice were the figures for July, when the more contagious delta variant took hold across the U.S. and hit Florida especially hard. For that month alone, the vaccines’ effectiveness in preventing hospitalization remained high — 81% for Moderna’s and 75% for Pfizer’s — but was lower for preventing infection — 76% for Moderna’s and 42% for Pfizer’s. Calling the study’s data ""very preliminary"" and ""limited in geographic scope,"" Mayo told PolitiFact in a statement: ""We caution against drawing conclusions about vaccine effectiveness from a preprint study, which is intended only to be helpful to the scientific community and has not yet undergone the rigor of peer review."" The study authors noted: ""It is important to realize that most vaccines are not 100% effective, particularly against asymptomatic infections. For example, the estimated effectiveness of seasonal influenza vaccines has ranged from 19-60% over the past decade."" It’s also worth noting that since the delta variant became the dominant strain of the virus, COVID-19 hospitalizations and death have occurred predominantly among people who have not been vaccinated. In total, as of Aug. 9, 2021, more than 166 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated and, based on reports from 49 U.S. states and territories, there were 8,054 breakthrough cases in which the person was hospitalized or died, according to the latest figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That comes out to fewer than one-hundredth of 1%. Seven states, including some with the lowest vaccination rates, accounted for about half of new cases and hospitalizations in the previous week, the White House said at a briefing Aug. 5. They include Florida (49.7% fully vaccinated), Texas (44.6%), Missouri (42.3%), Arkansas (37.7%), Louisiana (37.7%), Alabama (35%) and Mississippi (35.2%). As of Aug. 12, according to Mayo Clinic, 50.6% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. An Instagram post claims: ""Mayo Clinic study shows Pfizer vaccine dropped to 42% effective."" The Mayo study, which is not yet peer-reviewed, looked at people who had received at least one dose of the two-shot Pfizer and Moderna vaccines. It found that from January to July 2021, the Pfizer vaccine was 85% effective in preventing hospitalization and 76% effective in preventing infection. In July alone, after the virus’ more contagious delta variant had taken hold, Pfizer’s vaccine was 75% effective in preventing hospitalization but only 42% in preventing infection. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974B8A80>],/factchecks/2021/aug/17/instagram-posts/claim-pfizer-covid-19-vaccine-42-effective-leaves-/

Instagram post incorrectly interprets Pfizer vaccine study
","A Pfizer-commissioned study published in July found the company’s COVID-19 vaccine was 96.7% effective in preventing people from developing severe symptoms or being hospitalized. The finding was in line with previous clinical trials that have shown the Pfizer vaccine is extremely effective at preventing or reducing the severity of coronavirus infections.  But an Instagram user claimed the figure doesn’t tell the whole story. ""Pfizer releases results of six-month long study showing their vaccine reduces severe COVID symptoms/hospitalizations by 0.1%,"" the now-deleted Aug. 4 post read. In a follow-up post, the user didn’t dispute the 96.7% efficacy rate Pfizer reported, but called it misleading. The user claimed that her way of measuring gives people a better idea of a vaccine’s efficacy, and she puts that number at 0.1%, which sounds like it’s close to nothing. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The crux of the claims is the difference between ""relative risk reduction"" and ""absolute risk reduction."" Both are metrics for measuring a vaccine’s efficacy, and both can be calculated from the raw data of longer-term studies such as Pfizer’s.  But the claim errs in arguing that one of the measures is misleading or less accurate than the other. Both metrics can be valuable to researchers and public health officials trying to gauge the effectiveness of a vaccine.  One key difference in how they affect perceptions: The more commonly used measure, relative risk reduction, tends to sound like a high number for a vaccine that works well, while absolute risk reduction is usually a lower number, because it reflects the baseline risk in the population of getting infected or severely ill. Some scientists argue that drug makers should always report both figures to provide a balanced picture of a particular intervention. We contacted the Instagram user, who provided an explanation to PolitiFact for the basis of her claim. But her calculation left out a step in arriving at the 0.1% efficacy rate, according to a Pfizer representative and an author of the study. PolitiFact previously checked a similar claim that conflated absolute risk reduction and relative risk reduction for the different COVID-19 vaccines currently in use around the world. We rated Mostly False a claim that vaccine makers were deceiving the public by reporting one of the two figures. Both figures are used to describe efficacy, and can be expressed in percentage terms, but they measure different things and are calculated differently. Broadly speaking, one describes the probability of avoiding illness by getting vaccinated. The other represents the proportion of people in the population who avoided illness by getting vaccinated. In the case of the recent Pfizer study, the 96.7% figure is the relative risk reduction, the metric most commonly used to express a vaccine’s efficacy. It compares two groups — those who got vaccinated vs. those who got a placebo — as a ratio to show how much being vaccinated reduced an individual’s likelihood of developing severe symptoms. Relative risk reduction provides an estimate of how effective a vaccine is at preventing a disease compared with someone who received a placebo, according to Dr. Stephen Thomas, lead author on the Pfizer study and chief of infectious disease at SUNY Upstate Medical University. Absolute risk reduction draws on the raw numbers from the trial data to estimate how the vaccine would affect the incidence of serious symptoms in the broader population. It’s calculated as the arithmetic difference between the incidence rates in the two populations — vaccinated vs. unvaccinated.  This measure accounts for people’s baseline risks of getting seriously sick from COVID-19, and changes across different groups and timeframes.  ""Both are valid measures,"" said Kit Longley, a Pfizer spokesperson. ""They are simply calculated differently and used for different purposes to create a fuller understanding of a vaccine’s protection."" In the follow up post, which has also been deleted, and in messages to PolitiFact, the Instagram user said she calculated the absolute risk reduction for the Pfizer vaccine as 0.1% by looking at the the number of people out of the 22,000 in the placebo group who developed severe symptoms or were hospitalized — 30 divided by 22,000. Both Thomas and Longley said the Instagram user’s approach was wrong. Her calculation looked only at the placebo group. Calculating absolute risk reduction involves comparing the incidence rate for the placebo group with the incidence rate for the vaccinated group. An Instagram post said a Pfizer study showed that its vaccine ""reduces severe COVID symptoms/hospitalizations by 0.1%.""  That’s not what the study showed, Pfizer and one author of the study said. The study showed the vaccine is 96.7% effective in preventing severe symptoms or hospitalization from COVID-19, compared with a placebo.   The Instagram user said she arrived at her own efficacy number by calculating the absolute risk reduction instead of relative risk reduction. The two metrics measure different things. A representative from Pfizer and the study’s lead author both said the 0.1% figure was incorrectly calculated but did not provide further information. Absolute risk reduction is a valid measure of vaccine efficacy, but the Instagram user used a flawed calculation.

Did Virginia lawmakers hand Northam a $1 billion blank check?
","State Sen. David Suetterlein, R-Roanoke County, says the General Assembly recently handed Gov. Ralph Northam a ""$1 billion blank check."" His comment came in an Aug. 9 floor speech, moments before the Senate cast a largely partisan vote to approve a spending plan for $4.3 billion in federal coronavirus aid that left about one-fourth of the money unappropriated. The bill was also approved by the House and signed by Northam, a Democrat. ""I was not in a position where I could give this governor a $1 billion blank check,"" Suetterlein said in explaining why he opposed the bill. We fact-checked whether Northam has a free hand in spending the unappropriated money and found Suetterlein’s statement is highly exaggerated. The General Assembly left slightly more than $1.1 billion unappropriated in the current state budget, which ends June 30, 2022. They earmarked $354 million of that money for programs in the budget year that will begin next July 1. Left over is $761 million that the bill — now law — says the governor can dig into without General Assembly approval only ""to respond to a public health emergency or to prevent the emergence of a new health emergency."" Northam is required to notify the chairpersons of the House and Senate budget-writing committees at least five days before taking such action. The governor has this emergency power only until the General Assembly starts its next regular session, scheduled to begin Jan. 12, 2022. At that point, the money will be folded into a proposed state budget — for many possible uses — that would have to win legislative approval. We asked Suetterlein why he says Northam was given a ""blank check."" In an emailed reply, he repeated his assertion while also acknowledging that the law limits Northam’s use of ""nearly $1 billion"" in the unallocated money to health emergencies. Suetterlein mostly expressed frustration with the legislative process in passing the law, complaining that Democrats used their control of the General Assembly and the governor’s office to block Republican influence on spending the federal aid. That complaint is widely shared by GOP lawmakers. Suetterlein said Democrats ceded the General Assembly’s powers of appropriation to Northam. He said the action was unnecessary because the legislature could be convened on an emergency basis within 48 hours to make spending decisions in a health crisis. Suetterlein also said it is a departure from the General Assembly’s ""usual practice"" to leave $1 billion unappropriated. He noted the custom in previous budgets has been to leave less than $10 million unappropriated. Suetterlein said unappropriated funds in the General Assembly’s spending plan for federal coronavirus aid gave Northam ""a $1 billion blank check."" The legislature left Northam with $761 million of unallocated aid and put controls on its use. By law, Northam can only reach into the money without legislative approval only ""to respond to a public health emergency or to prevent the emergence of a new health emergency."" He must give the chairpersons of the House and Senate budget committees five days advance notice. The governor’s special power lasts only until January, when the General Assembly starts a two-month session. Suetterlein’s claim of a blank check is exaggerated. Northam has wide discretion in spending the money only in very specific circumstances. We rate Suetterlein’s statement Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C18AE40>],/factchecks/2021/aug/16/david-suetterlein/did-virginia-lawmakers-hand-northam-1-billion-blan/
