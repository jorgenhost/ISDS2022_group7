McAuliffe says more than half of Virginia's teachers are 50 or older
","
Virginia’s public school teaching corps is getting gray, says Terry McAuliffe, the Democratic nominee for governor. 
""Of our 98,000 teachers who are K-12, over 53,000 of those teachers today are over 50 years old,"" McAuliffe said during an April 27 speech at the opening of his Fairfax County campaign office. 
McAuliffe, who has been endorsed by the Virginia Education Association, said the statistics mean ""we’ve got to build a pipeline of new teachers."" To compete for the best teachers, McAuliffe said Virginia needs to substantially improve their pay and protect their retirement benefits. 
We wondered whether more than half of Virginia’s public school teachers really are older than 50. So we took a look and found that McAuliffe’s had merged figures from two databases that measure different things. 
Let’s consider McAuliffe’s numbers as a fraction. The numerator, or number on top, is 53,000. The denominator, or number on the bottom, is 98,000. 
First, let’s look at the numerator. Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, said the campaign got the number of 53,000 teachers older than 50 from the Virginia Retirement System, which manages the public school pensions of all full-time instructors. 
But there’s a problem with this number. VRS spokeswoman Jeanne Chenault told us that tally represents not just teachers over 50, but all of the full-time ""professional or clerical employees""  of school divisions across the state who have crossed that age threshold -- including administrators, counselors and secretaries. The VRS does not have age data for just teachers. 
Chenault said school employment numbers fluctuate and that the most current data, from June 2012, show 56,328 full time workers were 50 or older. 
Now, let’s look at the denominator. Schwerin sent us a slide from a state Department of Education presentation that said during 2010-11 school year, Virginia schools had an instructional staff of about 98,792. But this is the wrong figure to use. 
The correct denominator is 147,216 --which is the number of all full time public school employees at the end of last June. 
So, if McAuliffe is to rely on VRS information, the most he can say is that at the end of last school year, 56,328 of the 147,216 full time public school employees -- or 38.3 percent -- were 50 or older. 
That’s a far cry from McAuliffe’s claim that more than half of the teachers had crossed 50. 
We can drill to a more accurate estimate of the number of teachers who have lived a half century. Virginia’s Department of Education kept age data on the instructional staff at public schools -- teachers, librarians, guidance counselors and technology instructors -- through the 2010-11 school year. It no longer keeps those records. 
The same DOE slide presentation cited by McAuliffe’s campaign that shows the instructional staff at 98,792 at the end of the 2011 school year also says, on a different slide, that 33,462 of them were 50 or older. That breaks down to 33.9 percent. 
The state government’s workforce, by comparison, is older. VRS data from last year -- which does not include state troopers and other law enforcement officers, judges and college faculty -- shows that of 76,274 state bureaucrats, 37,290 were 50 or older. That’s 48.9 percent. 
Let’s also consider the national workforce. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, there was an average of 133.6 million full and part-time workers in the U.S. last year who were at least 20. Of them, 48.3 million were at least 50. That’s 36.2 percent. 
We should note that there has been some aging in nation’s teaching corps, as pointed out in a 2010 reportby the National Commission on Teaching and America’s Future. It said many Baby Boomers chose classroom careers in the 1960’s and ‘70’s, making the average age of teachers 36, ""one of the youngest teaching forces in history."" 
But by 2004, those Baby Boomers, who were still the majority, had aged and the national average was pushed to 42.5, ""older than it had been in more than half a century."" 
The average retirement age for teachers is 59, the report said. 
""We can expect to lose as many as a million and a half veteran teachers to retirement during the next eight years,"" the report said. 
The turnover of teachers is not necessarily a good thing or a bad thing. ""Policymakers want to keep great teachers in the classroom for as long as they can and encourage new, young talent into the profession,"" Emily Workman, an associate policy analyst for the Education Commission of the States, wrote to us in an email. 
Our ruling 
McAuliffe said, ""Of our 98,000 teachers who are K-12, over 53,000 of those teachers today are over 50 years old."" But he is mixing statistics that don’t don’t go together and his eye-popping claim that more than half of Virginia’s teachers have lived more than half a century doesn’t hold up. 
Virginia does not keep data that is solely focused on the age of teachers. The best statistics available show that the state’s instructional staff -- including teachers, librarians, guidance counselors and technology instructors -- was 98,792 during the 2010-11 school year and, of them, 33,462 were 50 or older. That’s 33.9 percent. 
The teaching corps is not moving toward retirement with anything close to the speed that McAuliffe described. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2013/may/17/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-more-half-virginias-teachers-are-50/

A lower drunken driving standard means a person could be drunk after one drink?
","
On May 14, 2013, a federal agency recommended reducing the threshold for evidence of drunken driving from a blood-alcohol concentration of 0.08 to 0.05. 
That means having a glass of wine at dinner might make a person drunk, a spokesman for the Tavern League of Wisconsin told the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel the same day. 
Under a BAC standard of 0.05, a person could get nailed for DUI after one drink? 
Tavern League’s evidence 
The statement was made by Scott Stenger, a Madison lobbyist whose clients include the tavern league. He told us he based his claim on news articles about the 0.05 recommendation, including a report from the Journal Sentinel and The Associated Press, and a chart on blood-alcohol concentration from the Texas Alcoholic Beverage Commission. 
The news covered the recommendation by the National Transportation Safety Board, which investigates transportation accidents and makes recommendations based on its findings. The board said states should cut the current blood-alcohol level for evidence of intoxication as part of a series of ideas aimed at reducing alcohol-related highway deaths. 
In its report, the Associated Press said 0.05 is ""about one drink for a woman weighing less than 120 pounds,"" and that a drink is defined as 12 ounces of beer, 4 ounces of wine, or 1 ounce of 80-proof alcohol ""in most studies."" 
Meanwhile, the Texas agency chart that Stenger cited says its BAC data comes from another federal body, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, which works to prevent highway crashes. 
That data says essentially what Stenger and AP did: A 100-pound woman could reach 0.05 after one drink. 
(Incidentally, both the AP and the chart used by the Texas agency said a 160-pound man could reach 0.05 after consuming two drinks in one hour.) 
So, there’s evidence that a limited group of drinkers -- women weighing under 120 pounds -- could be legally drunk after one drink, if the standard for drunken driving were reduced to a blood-alcohol level of 0.05. 
What other evidence is out there? 
BAC calculators 
We checked three online calculators that provide blood-alcohol concentration estimates based on various factors, including gender and weight. They generally found a BAC of less than 0.05 for a 100-pound woman consuming one drink. 
The calculator at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation (which also has a smartphone app), says the BAC would be 0.03. 
A more detailed calculator from the University of Notre Dame’s Office of Alcohol and Drug Education says the BAC would be 0.04 for a 5-ounce glass of wine, if the wine is red and 12.5 percent alcohol. 
And the calculator at Central Connecticut State University’s Office of Alcohol and Drug Education says the BAC would be 0.05 after a 5-ounce glass of table wine. 
So, why do the blood-alcohol concentration figures vary? 
Well, as we noted, all of the figures are estimates. 
The Wisconsin DOT also points out that besides gender, weight and the amount of alcohol consumed, other factors are in play. Your BAC will be higher if you drink faster or drink on an empty stomach. Women reach higher BACs faster because they have less water in their bodies and more adipose tissue (fat), which is not easily penetrated by alcohol. 
Jan Grebel, a chemical test supervisor for the DOT, told us about another factor: If you drink frequently, your liver can break down alcohol more efficiently, but if you don’t, your BAC would be higher after even one drink. 
Grebel quoted to us from a chart she utilizes when testifying in court in drunken driving cases. She said the chart estimates the BAC at 0.047 -- nearly 0.05 -- for a 100-pound woman after one drink. 
But Grebel said that would be the maximum BAC in that instance. 
Most people would not reach 0.05 after one drink, she said. 
Our rating 
The Tavern League of Wisconsin said a proposal to make 0.05 the standard for drunken driving would mean that having a glass of wine at dinner could make a person drunk. 
The statement is accurate, in that it’s possible an individual could reach 0.05 after one drink. But it needs additional information, namely that the situation would apply only in a small number of instances and would depend on other factors, such as drinking on an empty stomach. 
We rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/may/17/tavern-league-wisconsin/005-glass-wine-could-make-person-legally-drunk-wis/

Barack Obama says Austin's tech sector drives more than a quarter of local economy
","
Austin rocks, President Barack Obama indicated during his May 9, 2013, swing through the area, thanks in great part to its technology-related businesses.

After listing plans by Apple, Visa and General Motors to add jobs, Obama told students and teachers assembled at the Manor New Tech High School: ""According to one report, the tech sector now drives more than one-quarter of Austin’s economy. And all of this has helped to make Austin one of the fastest-growing cities in America.""

We know tech is big in these parts, but does it drive more than a quarter of Austin’s economy?

By email, White House spokesman Bobby Whithorne pointed out a press release issued earlier in May by the Austin Technology Council, a trade association for companies working in and around technology and life sciences. The release said the council had released results of its ""Technology Economic Impact Report"" finding that ""technology is generating billions of dollars annually and driving more than a quarter of Austin's local economy.""

But the May 6, 2013, report doesn’t exactly say that, though it quantifies the area’s tech boom in various ways.

The report says: ""While a respectable 9% of total employment is in technology (more than 100,000 jobs), more than one third of all jobs in the Austin economy are supported by the technology sector, including direct hiring and spin-off hiring activity.""

Reference No. 2: ""The sector accounts for a whopping 21% of Central Texas’ gross regional product (GRP) and contributes $21 (billion) in direct value to the local economy."" Researcher Brian Kelsey later told us by email that the government sector swept in about 12 percent of local output.

The council put us in touch with Brian Kelsey, a principal at Austin-based Civic Analytics, which conducted the research behind the report.

By email, Kelsey told us the president’s claim is true if one assumes he was talking about Austin tech’s share of jobs plus spin-off jobs.

For the research, Kelsey said, he defined Austin’s ""tech sector"" starting from the ""high-tech"" definition in TechAmerica Foundation’s annual ""Cyberstates"" publication. Its list encompasses 52 industries, among them communications equipment such as radio and TV broadcasting and wireless communications equipment; software services; engineering services; computer training; and space and defense systems. Kelsey said his firm added another industry, computer and computer peripheral equipment and software merchant wholesalers, ""which captures a significant portion of business activity at some of Austin's larger companies such as Dell, IBM, etc.""

All told, Kelsey said, the 53 industries ""contribute an estimated $20.9 billion to Austin's total Gross Regional Product,"" meaning the economic output in the five-county metropolitan region, ""of approximately $97.4 billion, or roughly 21 percent, a bit under ‘one-quarter.’""

Kelsey said total estimated employment (full-time, part-time, and self-employment) in Austin's tech sector accounted for 105,667 jobs in 2012, roughly 9 percent of all jobs in Austin. ""That's direct jobs--i.e. people employed in the 53 industries. If you look at the direct employment and the spin-off activity it creates in other industries (the multiplier effect), the tech sector supports an estimated one-third of total employment in Austin--so a bit more than ‘one-quarter,’"" he said. He added that most of the data behind the report, including the jobs multiplier of 3.5, came from Idaho-based Economic Modeling Specialists Intl., a company that specializes in economic impact studies.

Finally, we asked Jon Hockenyos, president of Austin-based TXP, Inc., an economic consulting firm, to look over the council’s study. Hockenyos said by email that the results looked accurate. Regarding Obama’s reference, Hockenyos said: ""I’d say the verb ‘drives’ (which to me implies more than the direct effect) makes the president’s remark consistent with the study’s findings.""

By telephone, the White House’s Whithorne stood by Obama’s wording, saying it was supported by the press release announcing the study and the study itself.

Our ruling

Obama said a report says the ""tech sector now drives more than one quarter of Austin’s economy.""

The cited report doesn't directly declare this, estimating instead that high-tech companies in the Austin region directly supplied about 9 percent of the area’s jobs in 2012 and accounted for roughly 21 percent of the region's economic output. 
Then again, the report also says jobs in the tech sector plus spin-off jobs amounted to more than a third of the region’s total jobs, which strikes us as sufficient to make Obama's claim partly accurate. We rate it as Half True.",/factchecks/2013/may/17/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-austins-tech-sector-drives-more-/

No, Biden is not arming up the IRS with guns and ammunition
","A division of the IRS that has existed for more than a century is getting a lot of attention on social media and conservative media. Fox News host Tucker Carlson led a segment on his Aug. 4, 2022, show by telling his audience to be worried because the government is ""treating the IRS as a military agency"" and ""stockpiling"" ammunition. He asked guest U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., ""Why would the IRS need millions of dollars worth of guns and ammo?"" Gaetz replied, ""Well, Joe Biden is raising taxes, disarming Americans, so of course they are arming up the IRS like they are preparing to take Fallujah."" Gaetz's comments about Biden came after Carlson cited reports from 2018 and 2020 about IRS spending on weapons and ammunition — expenditures that happened before Biden took office. Gaetz went on to say that the IRS has also spent $731,000 this year — he didn’t say specifically on what — ""to quite literally weaponize your country against you."" In June, Gaetz, who has co-sponsored a bill to prevent the IRS from purchasing ammunition, made a similar allegation in an interview with Fox News host Jesse Watters. Then he accused the Biden administration of suppressing access to ammunition ""for regular Americans"" while ""scooping up all of the ammo they can possibly find."" In that interview, he said the IRS spent $725,000 this year on ammunition. He also cited that figure in a June press release about his bill. A spokesperson for Gaetz did not return a request for comment regarding the grounds for his claim. Here’s what we know: The IRS did spend about $725,000 on ammunition this year. But that is not unusual, and is actually a bit less than what was spent in other recent years. These purchases are not new or unique to the Biden administration — they have been made for an IRS division that has been armed for more than a century.  The IRS buys guns and ammunition yearly for IRS Criminal Investigation, the division that has jurisdiction over federal tax crimes. The people who work there are not the typical auditors that Americans facing routine audits will encounter. The vast majority of those audits are done by mail. The division in which agents are armed was established in 1919, when it was called the Intelligence Unit, according to the division’s 2019 report. The unit famously investigated gangster Al Capone, who was convicted on tax evasion charges. It was renamed the IRS Criminal Investigation in 1978. Special agents in the division investigate a number of crimes, including money laundering, cybercrime, financial fraud and narcotics-related crimes. Recently they’ve been part of a multiagency task force tracking down assets of Russian oligarchs.  The division had 2,046 special agents in 2021, a little less than the 2,159 agents it had in 2017. Those numbers haven’t changed much in five years, according to annual reports available on its website; the 2022 report has not been published. The numbers haven’t changed much in decades. In the division’s 2017 report, then-division chief Don Fort wrote, ""We have the same number of special agents — around 2,200 — as we did 50 years ago."" Special agents train for weeks at the National Criminal Investigation Training Academy in Georgia, the 2021 report said. That includes firearms training and handgun qualifications for agents, which is a big reason for the large orders for ammunition. The IRS Criminal Investigation division ordered $725,460 worth of ammunition in fiscal year 2022, according to figures provided to PolitiFact by Justin Cole, the division’s communications director. That’s slightly more than the money spent in 2021 ($655,013) and 2020 ($616,619). According to a 2018 report (page 75 of the PDF) to Congress by the U.S. Government Accountability Office on firearms and ammunition purchases by federal law enforcement agencies, the IRS spent about $1.1 million on ammunition in 2011 and about $1 million in 2012. From 2010 to 2017, it averaged $712,500 in ammunition spending. The report described its numbers as minimum values because agencies reported challenges compiling requested data. The report also said the IRS had 4,461 firearms and about 5 million rounds of ammunition in stock as of November 2017. The report notes the numbers don’t include weapons or ammunition purchased for a small, separate IRS police force of fewer than a dozen officers that provides security at the Enterprise Computing Center in Martinsburg, West Virginia. The report’s authors noted that officials at law enforcement agencies said they keep ammunition on hand to last for several months for use in training and operation, and that they order large quantities because sometimes there’s a long wait, up to a year, before the orders can be fulfilled. The Government Accountability Office said that it does not have more recent data available. The IRS is not the only government agency that some people may be surprised to find purchasing guns and ammunition for law enforcement officers.  Gaetz mentioned the Department of Agriculture, which buys weapons and ammunition for the U.S. Forest Service, and the Department of Education, which purchases them for its Office of the Inspector General. The GAO report lists several others, including the Department of Health and Human Services and the Food and Drug Administration. As to Gaetz’s claim that these efforts come because Biden is ""raising taxes and disarming Americans,"" there is no evidence that the IRS’ longstanding spending on weapons and ammunition is connected to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions. Biden supports a House bill to ban certain assault weapons, but that measure is not likely to pass in the Senate and, even if it did, does not amount to a plan to wholesale disarm American citizens.  Biden’s plan to raise taxes targets corporations and high-earning money managers, assuming the Inflation Reduction Act passes the U.S. House. That bill may have secondary effects on average Americans that are hard to measure, experts told PolitiFact. But, even so, the routine audits the IRS performs on average Americans do not involve those armed agents who deal with criminal investigations. Gaetz claimed that the government is arming up the IRS because the president is raising taxes and disarming Americans, citing the amount of money spent on ammunition by the agency this year. But there’s been no significant increase in spending on ammunition, and Gaetz ignores that the IRS Criminal Investigation division has existed for more than a century and that the weapons and ammunition are for those law enforcement officers. That division had fewer special agents in 2021 than it had in 2017, but the number of agents has stayed about the same for decades. The $725,000 the division spent this year on ammunition, much of which is used for agents’ firearms training, is only slightly more than was spent in recent years and less than was spent a decade ago. There is no evidence this continued tradition of spending by the IRS has any connection to Biden’s positions on taxes and gun restrictions. We rate this claim False.

Democrat Evers didn’t give Wisconsin counties 'the green light' to defund police
","Heading into November, look for Republicans to hammer Democratic Gov. Tony Evers on crime and police funding. Indeed, they already have been. As Republicans were still picking Tim Michels as their nominee to face Evers, the Republican Governors Association sent an email blast to Wisconsin reporters on July 29, 2022 that contained this quote from spokeswoman Maddie Anderson: ""Wisconsin families are desperate for a leader whose top priority is keeping their communities safe. Instead, Governor Tony Evers gave counties the green light to defund Wisconsin's police departments. Elections have consequences, and Evers will come to find that out very soon."" The email came after a violent week in Milwaukee left a 6-year-old girl dead. The defund the police angle is an echo of attacks on Democrats that began after the May 2020 murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer sparked protests across the nation. Many protests called for police budgets to be dramatically cut or, in some cases, the departments eliminated and replaced. We rated False a previous claim by Republican gubernatorial candidate Rebecca Kleefisch that Evers is ""a big proponent of this defund the police movement."" In fact, Evers has said slashing police budgets ""goes too far"" and directed $100 million in COVID relief money toward enhancing law enforcement. So, let’s look at the RGA claim that Evers gave cities and counties ""the green light"" to defund police departments.  When asked for backup, Anderson pointed to an Aug. 6, 2021, veto by Evers of a bill that would have cut state aid to cities and counties that reduced any part of their police budgets and given that money instead to cities that didn’t cut police spending.  He vetoed it on the same day he signed a separate Republican bill to set use of force standards for police departments. In an Aug. 1, 2022 email, Anderson argued: ""He vetoed a bill that would have dissuaded counties from defunding police departments. Sent a clear message to counties that there is no penalty for defunding or reallocating resources from police departments. Hence the green light."" Let’s dig deeper.  First, we should note that the veto means there is something behind the claim, even if it’s now being misrepresented. Despite how Anderson framed it, the Evers veto leaves the status quo in place. In that respect, nothing changes. And, as we know, state aid and local governments, particularly as it relates to police spending, can get sticky. In his veto message, Evers said he killed the bill because it placed ""onerous restrictions"" on the ability of local governments to set their budgets. The bill would have reduced shared revenue payments to municipalities that decreased spending on police, fire and emergency services or reduced the number of people employed in those areas. The legislation specifically targeted municipalities employing at least 30 people in those areas and only applied to portions of the emergency service budget for hiring, training and retaining employees.  The nonpartisan Wisconsin Policy Forum issued reports in June 2020 and August 2021 on police funding trends in Wisconsin. The reports found spending on policing n Wisconsin peaked in 2013 and was trending downward well before the rise of the ""defund the police"" approach captured national attention.  Even as funding has fallen, spending on police remains the largest piece of municipal spending in the state. The forum concluded those declines in funding are more related to counties and municipalities struggling under state-imposed limits on how much they can collect in the property tax levy and flat state aid. Local governments have largely shielded police and fire services from budget cuts in the past decade, the report found. Anderson’s argument that the veto gives a green light on cutting budgets runs counter to the governor’s own statements and actions. Just days after the Floyd case, Evers specifically opposed cutting spending on law enforcement in a meeting with Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporters and editors.  In a June 4, 2020 article, Evers was quoted as saying: ""We're always going to need police service"" and that ""to completely defund police departments ... that isn't going to work.’"" Later, as noted, Evers provided more than $100 million to law enforcement through federal relief funds. The Republican Governors Association claimed Evers gave Wisconsin counties ""the green light"" to defund the police.  A spokesperson for the association pointed to a veto of a Republican bill that would penalize counties and municipalities that reduce police budgets regardless of context. So, it’s not like there is nothing there. But that veto simply kept the status quo – it was not a proactive step by Evers to force or encourage cities and counties to cut law enforcement. What’s more, Evers has flatly stated he does not support defunding the police, and directed $100 million in pandemic aid to law enforcement. So, the statement ""contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.""  That’s what we call Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2022/aug/12/republican-governors-association/democrat-evers-didnt-give-wisconsin-counties-green/

Kevin McCarthy’s mostly false claim about an army of 87,000 IRS agents
","The Democrats’ tax and spending bill, called the Inflation Reduction Act, has about $80 billion over 10 years for the IRS to boost collections by $204 billion. Among other purposes, the agency says it will use the money to target high-income earners and corporations.  House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, along with many other Republicans, say otherwise. ""Democrats' new army of 87,000 IRS agents will be coming for you — with 710,000 new audits for Americans who earn less than $75k,"" McCarthy tweeted Aug. 9. Do you make $75,000 or less? Democrats' new army of 87,000 IRS agents will be coming for you—with 710,000 new audits for Americans who earn less than $75k. McCarthy’s office didn’t get back to us to explain where he got his numbers, but they are misleading. This 87,000 figure comes from a May 2021 Treasury Department assessment of how it would use $80 billion to improve IRS operations. The report said the IRS would add 86,852 new full-time positions. (The plan is not written in stone. The Treasury Department says that in the coming months, it will decide how to allocate the new money.) But even in the 2021 plan, not all of the hires would be auditors, or work in enforcement. The report said the money would go toward many things, including ""hiring new specialized enforcement staff, modernizing antiquated information technology, and investing in meaningful taxpayer service."" Although the agency’s staff would increase, it’s key to note that over half of the IRS workforce is close to retirement. The plan was created with that exodus in mind and aims to hire thousands of people to simply maintain current levels. Today, the IRS has about 80,000 employees. ""The IRS will lose about 50,000 people over the next five or six years,"" said Natasha Sarin, Treasury’s counselor for tax policy and implementation. ""A lot of this hiring is about replacing those people."" Sarin said another factor makes the 87,000 figure less than it appears to be. The agency’s projection of new hires was based on the idea that if things stayed as they were, another decade of business as usual would result in staff cuts. Over the past decade, the IRS has seen its funding drop by 20%. Between 2010 and 2018, the number of enforcement personnel fell by nearly a third. If that trend continued, the IRS would not only be replacing people lost to retirement, but to expected budget cuts. So, the 87,000 wasn’t exclusively for people on the enforcement side, and it wasn’t all going to boost the overall size of the IRS workforce. U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas, the top Republican on the House Ways and Means Committee, appears to have been the first to cite the 710,000 figure. Brady arrived at the number by bringing together two pieces of data. In 2021, the Congressional Budget Office said that $80 billion more for the IRS would ""return audit rates to the levels of about 10 years ago."" Brady took the audit rates of 2010 and applied them to the number of tax returns in 2018 — broken down by income groups. Using his approach, there would be about 710,000 more audits for filers reporting less than $75,000 in income. But the approach ignores several key details about what the CBO report says in full and what the bill — and the Treasury — have made clear: This effort is intended to increase audits of corporations and high net-worth individuals. The full sentence in the CBO report that Brady was drawing from said the audit ""rate would rise for all taxpayers, but higher-income taxpayers would face the largest increase."" Brady took a broad statement and applied it across the board to all income groups. Brady also failed to note a key difference between the CBO assessment from a year ago and the bill under consideration today. The CBO assumed in its report that $60 billion of the $80 billion would go toward enforcement. But the current bill would result in substantially less than that — $46 billion — for enforcement, according to a Congressional Research Service analysis. With nearly a third less money, the number of resulting audits likely would also be less than one would expect based on the CBO report. Sarin also noted that some of the people who report little or no income are high-income earners who have gamed the system to drive their tax bill as close to zero as possible. Perhaps most important however, Brady’s projection runs directly counter to the stated policy of the IRS. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen laid out the agency’s policy in a letter to IRS commissioner Charles Rettig. ""I direct that any additional resources — including any new personnel or auditors that are hired — shall not be used to increase the share of small business or households below the $400,000 threshold that are audited relative to historical levels,"" Yellen wrote Aug. 10. That wasn’t new information. Rettig said the same thing in an Aug. 4 letter to Congress. Audit rates for filers reporting less than $75,000 have held steady over the past several years at about 0.4%. In contrast, in 2011, the audit rate was more than double at 1%. Yellen said enforcement will focus on corporations and people with high net-worth. Auditing them requires staff with special skills. Today, she said, the agency is only able to audit about 7,500 out of 4 million such returns each year. Sarin at the Treasury Department said the number of audits will rise, but more of them will be at the high end of the income distribution and fewer at the low end. The logic is simple, she said. That’s where the money is. The top 1% of earners, she said, account for about 30% of the $600 billion each year that is owed but goes uncollected. This would be a turnaround for the IRS. Historically, it has targeted some of the lowest earners, largely households who file for the Earned Income Tax Credit. There’s no guarantee that the agency will adhere to the new policy it has announced, but there’s no guarantee that it won’t. McCarthy said an ""army of 87,000 IRS agents will be coming for you — with 710,000 new audits for Americans who earn less than $75k."" The IRS has indicated it plans to increase its staffing and enforcement. But the 87,000 figure is flawed because not all of those employees would work in IRS enforcement, and not all of them would be new workers added to the overall workforce. Some hires would maintain staffing levels that would have fallen if past trends of budget cuts continued. The 710,000 audit estimate runs counter to the stated policy of the IRS and is based on a flawed use of a CBO estimate that assumed much higher spending on enforcement than is in the current Democratic bill.

That bill, the article said, allows the IRS ""to hire and arm 87,000 new agents."" The number is misleading. It comes from a year-old IRS document about new hires numbering 86,852 full-time positions, but a portion of that would be used to replace retiring employees, and the hiring covered three areas — taxpayer service, enforcement and IT. The article goes on with an alarming — and wholly unsubstantiated — story: The truck’s driver and passenger were gagged and zip-tied and taken away in one of the SUVs, the article claimed, and inside the trailer were ""23,500 crated Sig Sauer P229s and 160,000 rounds of .40 caliber ammunition, ostensibly intended for the IRS’s enhanced police force.""

Spanberger agrees with Biden most of the time
","President Joe Biden won’t be on ballots this fall, but his name will loom in Virginia’s closely-watched 7th Congressional District race between incumbent Democrat Rep. Abigail Spanberger and Republican Yesli Vega. Vega, a Prince William County supervisor, is trying to tie Spanberger to Biden, who has a low 39% approval rating in Virginia, according to a recent poll. ""Abigail Spanberger still votes with and shares Joe Biden’s positions 100% of the time,"" Vega said in a July 11 Facebook post. We fact-checked Vega’s claim and found it to be largely correct. Vega relied on data from FiveThirtyEight, a nonpartisan website that collects and analyzes statistics on politics, sports and other topics. The site keeps records of each Congress member’s presidential support — the percentage of times a congress member votes in support of the president when the White House has taken a clear position on legislation. The website identifies 73 bills and resolutions on which Biden stated a position since taking office in January 2021. Spanberger backed Biden each time, including votes to: Expand firearm regulations; Cap out-of-pocket insulin costs;  Strengthen voting rights laws; Expand debt limits;  Protect abortion rights; Invest $1.2 trillion in infrastructure; Provide $1.9 trillion for COVID-19 relief. Although Spanberger has always voted for Biden’s agenda, Vega overshoots in additionally saying Spanberger shares the president’s positions all of the time. In July, Fox News called her one ""of a handful of Democrats to break with her party to call attention to the southern border crisis."" Spanberger disagreed with Biden’s efforts this spring to lift an emergency health order to turn away migrants at the U.S.-Mexican border. She has pushed Biden to take stronger steps to prevent fentanyl from crossing the border. Spanberger’s voting record is typical in this highly partisan era; 199 of the 225 Democrats who have served in the House since Biden’s inauguration have 100% voting records with him. The lowest level of support by a House Democrat is 84.1%, by Rep. Jared Golden, D-Maine. Conversely, the median level of House Republican support for Biden is 11%. Only five of 216 Republicans have voted with Biden more than half of the time. Donald Trump, during the final two years of his presidency, had median support of 92.5% from Republican House members and 6.8% from Democrats. It should also be noted that presidential support is one way to measure a congress member’s partisanship. Spanberger points to another way that’s used by the Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University. It gauges how often a member of Congress introduces bills that attract co-sponsors from the other party, and how often they in turn co-sponsor a bill introduced from across the aisle. Under this method, Spanberger was rated the fifth most bipartisan House member in 2021 — the most recent report.  Spanberger also points to a broad analysis of House votes by ProPublica, a non-profit investigative journalism service. It shows that she agreed with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., on 389 of 840 votes — or 46% of the time - since January 2021. Spanberger is seeking to distance herself from Biden this fall. She told Fox News in June that she’s not planning to stump with Biden. ""I intend to do the campaigning myself,"" she said. ""I am the candidate. It’s my name on the ballot.""  Vega said, ""Abigail Spanberger still votes with and shares Joe Biden’s positions 100% of the time."" Vega correctly cites data from a nonpartisan website that measures the percentage of times a congress member votes in support of the president when the White House has taken a clear position on legislation. Spanberger’s record is not unique — 198 other Democratic House members also have 100% voting records with Biden since he became president.  Vega oversteps, however, in saying Spanberger shares Biden’s position all the time. She has, for example, disagreed with portions of Biden’s U.S.-Mexico border policies that have not been subject to votes.

Video underestimates California’s capacity to accommodate electric cars and recycle their batteries
","As part of his $10 billion zero-emission vehicle plan to fight climate change, California Gov. Gavin Newsom wants to phase out gasoline-powered cars in favor of electric powered ones by 2035. And President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, passed Aug. 7 by the U.S. Senate, would give Americans a tax credit of up to $7,500 to defray the cost of buying an electric vehicle. But an Instagram post claims difficulty with recycling lithium-ion batteries, the fuel cells in electric vehicles, will render this push toward zero-emission vehicles impractical. A video posted June 9 and shared by others features a woman talking about California officials advocating for more renewable energy and for residents to drive electric cars. The woman makes several claims, including that the push for more electric cars is not a ""sustainable solution"" as there isn’t a plant in California that can recycle their batteries once they die. ""There’s only three (electric car battery recycling plants) in the United States, and they can only recycle about 10% of the materials, which means the balance will go into landfills,"" she says. ""This could do more damage to our planet in a matter of 10 years than fossil fuels have done in 100 years."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. Instagram is owned by Facebook’s parent company, Meta. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) While the woman was right in saying California doesn't have a plant dedicated to recycling electric car batteries, the situation isn't as dire as she claimed. The woman was also wrong in her statement about the recyclability of lithium-ion car batteries.  Most electric car batteries last at least 100,000 miles before their ability to hold a charge seriously degrades, according to Carfax. With Americans driving an average of 13,476 miles each year, that translates to at least seven years of reliable service. Most batteries will go for significantly longer than the initial 100,000 miles before dying. The first major wave of electric car batteries dying off is expected to happen within the next 10 to 15 years, the BBC reported. Unlike lead-acid batteries, which are small and easily recyclable, electric cars use battery packs that are larger and composed of hundreds of individual lithium-ion batteries. The hazardous materials within a battery pack can spark a fire or explode if handled or disposed of incorrectly. Also, California lacks an electric car battery recycling plant; there are only five such facilities currently operating in the U.S. However, Alissa Kendall, a UC Davis civil and environmental engineering professor, told PolitiFact that California not having a recycling facility was a ""particularly irrelevant"" point, as there are ""many things we recycle or process in the U.S. economy that don’t have a site in every state."" Kendall said Nevada-based Redwood Materials launched an electric car battery recycling program in California in February and partnered with California car dealerships and battery dismantlers to collect lithium-ion batteries. The batteries will be sent to Redwood’s recycling facility in Nevada. Kendall was the lead author of a California Environmental Protection Agency report in May that said electric car battery recycling was a relatively new, but growing industry.The report also made several recommendations to the California Legislature for improving  electric car battery recycling. Meanwhile, there are several ways  to recycle electric car batteries, all of which reclaim significantly more material than the 10% the Instagram video cited. One method is through smelting, which melts a battery down at a high temperature until its materials separate from one another. Because this method requires a lot of greenhouse gas-producing energy but recovers only about 40% to 50% of a battery’s material, it’s less widely used, the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. reported.. The other two recycling methods, which are more widely used, involve shredding lithium-ion batteries into small pieces. A shredded battery can be recycled directly, by removing and separating its parts by hand, or through hydrometallurgy, in which the batteries' pieces are submerged in a solution and chemically separated. These shredding methods can recover up to 90% to 95% of a battery’s components. Kendall said lithium-ion batteries’ worst-case environmental impact  would still be less than  fossil fuels’.  ""While we certainly can improve mining practices and recycling systems for every material and product in our economy, there are very few measures whereby oil and gas extraction and refining are less harmful than lithium extraction (for electric car batteries),"" she said. A woman in an Instagram video claims California’s push for electric cars is not sustainable in part because California does not have a recycling facility that can handle the lithium-ion batteries in cars and that the recycling facilities in the country can recycle only 10% of the batteries’ material.  While California so far has no lithium-ion battery recycling plant, the California Environmental Protection Agency report said lithium-ion battery recycling is still a fairly new industry with room for growth. Also, companies from other states are partnering with California to recycle its batteries. Furthermore, current recycling methods can recover from half to up to 95% of the material used lithium-ion batteries, far more than the post’s claim of a 10% recovery rate.  We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2022/aug/11/instagram-posts/video-underestimates-californias-capacity-accommod/

How does Trump feel about the Fifth Amendment? Depends who is taking it.
","Former President Donald Trump invoked the Fifth Amendment during questioning by the New York attorney general’s office as part of a civil investigation into his business practices. The amendment protects against self-incrimination. His decision to not answer questions stood in contrast to statements he made in the past about people who took the Fifth; he once said the option was for people who were in the mob. Time for a look at Trump’s statements about the Fifth Amendment on our Flip-O-Meter. The rating is not making a value judgment about a politician who changes positions on an issue — our purpose on the Flip-O-Meter is to document if the person’s position has changed.  Trump has expressed a mixture of opinions about the Fifth Amendment depending upon his position about the person at the center of the relevant legal case. In 2016, he repeatedly criticized Hillary Clinton’s aides for taking the Fifth Amendment over questions about her emails. But in August, as Trump found himself at the center of multiple investigations, he was in favor of taking the Fifth. New York Attorney General Letitia James opened an investigation to explore whether ""Trump’s annual financial statements inflated the values of Trump’s assets to obtain favorable terms for loans and insurance coverage, while also deflating the value of other assets to reduce real estate taxes."" In his 1990 divorce from Ivana, Trump invoked the Fifth Amendment, wrote Wayne Barrett in his 1992 book, ""Trump: The Greatest Show on Earth."" ""Donald preaches in every speech, including the one announcing his presidential bid, about his devotion to the Second Amendment. But it was the Fifth Amendment that was his favorite when he was deposed in the divorce with Ivana, invoked 97 times to be exact, mostly in response to questions about ‘other women,’"" Barrett wrote. In a 1998 interview on MSNBC’s ""Hardball with Chris Matthews,"" Trump suggested that President Bill Clinton should have taken the Fifth Amendment in a deposition about Paula Jones, a woman who accused Clinton of sexual harrasment. The Jones investigation led independent prosecutor Kenneth Starr to Clinton’s affair with White House intern Monica Lewinsky. Trump said: ""And I’m not even sure that he shouldn't have just gone and taken the Fifth Amendment and said, ‘Look, I don't get along with this man, Starr. He's after me. He's a Republican, he’s this, he’s that,’ and you know, just taken the Fifth Amendment. It's a terrible thing for a president to take the Fifth Amendment, but he probably should have done it."" In 2014, when actor Bill Cosby was facing sexual assault allegations, Trump tweeted his advice: ""if you are innocent, do not remain silent. You look guilty as hell!"" During multiple rallies and political events in 2016, Trump criticized Clinton aides for taking the Fifth Amendment. At an Iowa rally, Trump said: ""Her staffers taking the Fifth Amendment, how about that?"" He added, ""You see the mob takes the Fifth. If you're innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?"" In Nevada, Trump said, ""Her staffers took the Fifth Amendment and got immunity deals. It's worse than Watergate."" In Colorado, Trump said, ""Her staffers took the Fifth. So many people took the Fifth Amendment there was nobody left!"" During a presidential debate, Trump said: ""When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth so they’re not prosecuted, when you have the man that set up the illegal server taking the Fifth, I think it’s disgraceful. And believe me, this country thinks it’s — really thinks it’s disgraceful, also."" In an Aug. 10 statement following his deposition, Trump explained why he took the Fifth Amendment: ""I once asked, ‘If you’re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?’ Now I know the answer to that question. When your family, your company, and all the people in your orbit have become the targets of an unfounded, politically motivated witch hunt supported by lawyers, prosecutors, and the fake news media, you have no choice. If there was any question in my mind, the raid of my home, Mar-a-Lago, on Monday by the FBI, just two days prior to this deposition, wiped out any uncertainty. I have absolutely no choice because the current administration and many prosecutors in this country have lost all moral and ethical bounds of decency. ""Accordingly, under the advice of my counsel and for all of the above reasons, I declined to answer the questions under the rights and privileges afforded to every citizen under the United States Constitution."" Multiple investigations into Trump saw action this week. He faces criminal investigations by the Justice Department and Fulton County prosecutors in Georgia. Earlier this week, the FBI executed a search warrant at his Mar-a-Lago estate. It is unknown whether or when Trump would face criminal charges. Answers in civil investigations can be used in a criminal case, said Kendall Coffey, a former U.S. attorney in Miami now in private practice. ""Individuals have a right to assert the Fifth to avoid making comments that may be incriminating. This may be a civil investigation, but it doesn’t limit potential use of his testimony in a criminal investigation."" Trump’s explanation for taking the Fifth Amendment because he is being targeted by prosecutors is a reason many people give for asserting their Fifth Amendment privilege, Ohio State University law professor Ric Simmons said.  ""They claim that even though they have nothing to hide, a prosecutor will be able to use the testimony against them in an unfair way to charge or convict them of something they did not do.  This is almost always an unfounded claim; there are very few cases in this country of a prosecutor ‘targeting’ an individual or acting in bad faith to use a person's testimony against them. Trump's case is no different.""   Trump has a complicated relationship with the Fifth Amendment and his position comes down to how he feels about who is taking it. A biography of Trump said he took the Fifth Amendment in his 1990 divorce case. He also expressed that Bill Clinton should have taken the Fifth. In 2014, however, he had the opposite advice for Bill Cosby, telling him silence would make him look guilty. In 2016, Trump criticized Hillary Clinton aides for taking the Fifth Amendment. But when Trump sat for a deposition with lawyers for the New York attorney general, he took the Fifth because he said he is a target of an ""unfounded, politically motivated witch hunt."" Trump is at the center of multiple investigations that are years in the making, and we don’t yet know whether he will be charged with any crimes. Trump has changed his view on the Fifth Amendment depending upon the situation. His latest stance represents a partial change, we rate it a Half Flip.

Transition-related surgery limited to teens, not 'young kids.' Even then, it's rare
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis suspended Hillsborough State Attorney Andrew Warren, in part, for signing a pledge against the criminalization of gender-affirming health care. Although Florida has not enacted any law prohibiting transgender medical treatment for children, DeSantis cited Warren's pledge not to prosecute doctors who offer these services as evidence of his neglect of duty. DeSantis has mocked the term ""gender-affirming care,"" which the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services says can include medical, surgical and mental health services for transgender and nonbinary people. ""When you have the 2021 letter saying … no matter what a state declares about protecting child welfare with respect, I mean, you know, they use these euphemisms,"" DeSantis said at an Aug. 4 press briefing announcing the suspension. ""But what it is, is they're literally chopping off the private parts of young kids, and that's wrong."" This isn't the first time DeSantis suggested that ""young kids"" in the U.S. receive transition-related surgeries. DeSantis criticized these procedures in an Aug. 3 conference:  ""They want to castrate these young boys, that's wrong. We stood up and said, from the health and children's well-being perspective, you don't disfigure 10, 12, 13-year-old kids based on gender dysphoria."" We found no examples of doctors ""literally chopping off the private parts of young kids,"" as DeSantis said.  ""That is not true under any existing medical guidelines,"" said Dr. Jack Turban, assistant professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco. ""No medical or surgical interventions are considered for prepubertal children."" The governor's office sent PolitiFact two examples of people who received transition-related surgeries in their mid to late teenage years  — one at 15 and one at 17. DeSantis' Florida Department of Health differentiates between children (under 10) and adolescents (10-18).

In one case DeSantis provided, an individual from California received masculinizing chest surgery at 15. Under existing California law, an insurer cannot deny coverage for the surgery — which includes double mastectomies —  based on a patient's age alone.  The procedure is mostly offered to teenagers 15 and older, The New York Times reported. However, we found one report of a 14-year-old who obtained the procedure, and there isn't a consensus on a specific age requirement among medical guidelines. The other case involved Jazz Jennings, a transgender woman who stars in a reality television show on TLC. Jennings received genital reassignment surgery at 17. Genital reassignment surgery should be reserved for those 18 and older, according to guidelines for the medical care of transgender patients developed by the Endocrine Society and the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, or WPATH. C.P. Hoffman, senior policy counsel for the National Center for Transgender Equality, told PolitiFact that cases like Jennings are not common.  ""Even when a minor has parental support for their transition, transition-related surgeries are not typically performed prior to the age of 18,"" Hoffman said. ""While there are some reports of transgender teens between the ages of 16 and 18 receiving transition-related surgical care, these cases are exceedingly rare and based on the specific medical needs of the teen."" The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends what it terms a ""gender-affirmative care model"" for prepubescent children experiencing gender dysphoria  — distress people may experience because of the discrepancy between their gender identity and the sex assigned to them at birth. Gender-affirmative care is oriented toward understanding and appreciating a child's gender identity rather than providing puberty blockers, hormone therapy or surgery.  ""Before any physical interventions are considered for adolescents, extensive exploration of psychological, family and social issues should be undertaken,"" the WPATH guideline reads. The beginning of puberty, which generally occurs between the ages of 10 and 12, is a baseline for medical intervention. The Endocrine Society recommends against puberty blockers, which suppress the release of testosterone and estrogen during puberty, for prepubescent children. An adolescent can be prescribed the treatment at the onset of puberty. Hormone therapy can follow the use of puberty blockers, although it isn't typically considered for patients younger than 16 years old, according to the Endocrine Society.  WPATH recommends that ""moving from one stage to another should not occur until there has been adequate time for adolescents and their parents to assimilate fully the effects of earlier interventions."" The association's criteria for initiating surgical treatment include ""documentation of persistent gender dysphoria"" and the ""capacity to make a fully informed decision and to consent for treatment."" Under Florida law, a health care practitioner cannot provide or arrange medical services for a minor without parental consent. And many health insurance providers, including Aetna and Anthem, require a patient seeking genital reassignment surgery to be 18 or older to qualify for coverage. Our ruling DeSantis said, ""They are literally chopping off the private parts of young kids."" DeSantis' office provided two examples of teenagers who received transition-related surgeries. The Florida Department of Health would define both cases as involving adolescents, and experts say the procedures are rare for minors and aren't typically recommended. There are no examples we could find, or the governor's office provided, of transition-related surgeries for people under the age of 14.  Medical transitioning is not recommended for prepubescent children, as DeSantis suggested.

""The item that the MSM keeps under wraps is the Trump memo to provide troops for a ‘peaceful’ protest on January 6th,"" said the Aug. 2 post. ""So Trump asks for troops around the Capitol to make sure everyone is safe, but he gets turned down by the Democrats.

The House select committee investigating the Capitol attack plans to reconvene in September, but the hearings have already revealed plenty of information — none of which corroborates claims that former President Donald Trump requested thousands of National Guard troops be deployed to ensure peace on Jan 6. A president has the authority to activate the D.C. National Guard. (National Guard troops from states and territories are under the command of governors, although a president can also call them into federal service.) There is no record of Trump authorizing thousands of National Guard troops for the U.S. Capitol before the attack and no evidence that Democrats denied such a request. Christopher Miller served as acting defense secretary on Jan. 6, 2021. In a recorded deposition shared by the House committee investigating the attack, Miller said that Trump never gave an order to have National Guard troops ready.  To remove any doubt: Not only did Donald Trump fail to contact his Secretary of Defense on January 6th (as shown in our hearing), Trump also failed to give any order prior to January 6 to deploy the military to protect the Capitol.Here is Secretary Miller’s testimony— pic.twitter.com/joucnUHvBB Miller told the House committee that he formally approved a request from D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser for ""unarmed D.C. National Guard support"" for planned demonstrations on Jan. 5 and Jan. 6, 2021.  ""We received no further request for different or additional support until the Capitol was breached,"" Miller said. Ryan McCarthy, who was the U.S. Army secretary on Jan. 6, has also said Bowser’s request was the only one his office received before the attack. Miller told Vanity Fair that a few days before Jan. 6, during a meeting on an unrelated topic, Trump asked him how many troops the Defense Department planned to have on Jan. 6. Miller said he told Trump the plan was to provide National Guard support as requested by the District of Columbia. In response, Trump reportedly said, ""You’re going to need 10,000 people."" Miller thought Trump was being ""hyperbolic,"" Vanity Fair reported. Former White House Counsel Pat Cipollone testified that he was unaware of Trump making any phone calls to the defense secretary, attorney general or homeland security secretary on Jan. 6.  Former Vice President Mike Pence’s national security adviser, Gen. Keith Kellogg told committee investigators that he never heard Trump ask for the National Guard or a law enforcement response. When asked by the committee whether he would have known if troops were to be present or called up for a rally near the Capitol, Kellogg said: ""Yeah, I would have.""

Social media video doesn’t show evidence of voter fraud in Washington state
","Several social media users claimed wrongdoing following Washington state’s primary election on Aug. 2, when a video began circulating of a woman in Clark County collecting absentee ballots in a bag near a drop box. A copy of the video was shared on Facebook and shows a woman recording herself as she drives up to a drop box. The woman slows her vehicle when she reaches what appears to be an election worker wearing an orange safety vest and holding open a blue bag. The driver asks the worker why she is not allowing people to put their ballots in the drop box with the worker responding that it takes ""25 minutes to gather all the ballots that are in there and we have to close it right at 8 o’clock."" The worker goes on to say they’ve ""always closed this box, we’ve always been here,"" and tells the woman she can place her ballot in the box instead, if she’d prefer. Text across the Facebook video reads, ""here we go again,"" an apparent reference to other claims of impropriety involving election drop boxes following the 2020 election.  Others on social media used the video to suggest it was further proof of illegal activity and election fraud. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The scene does not reveal election wrongdoing. Rather, it shows election officials making themselves available to legally collect as many ballots as possible from people waiting in a car line near poll closure time. ""Unfortunately, this video is just another case of standard election best practices that have been taking place well before 2020 now being called into question as a result of rampant misinformation about voting by mail,"" said Kylee Zabel, a spokesperson for the National Vote at Home Institute, nonpartisan, nonprofit group based in Washington, D.C. Zabel used to serve as the communications director for the Washington Secretary of State’s Office. Clark County Election Supervisor Cathie Garber said officials began placing election administrators at drop boxes several years ago after previous elections led to long lines of people and traffic waiting to drop off their ballot, which caused long wait times and ""safety and security issues"" from crowded streets and sidewalks. In 2005, Washington allowed counties to implement a vote-by-mail system that lets residents mail in their ballots or drop them off at a collection box. Counties can also establish voting centers for people who still wish to vote in person.  Vote-by-mail was eventually adopted statewide in 2011.  Garber said an interpretation of Washington's Administrative Code allows election administrators to help voters at the drop boxes, including collecting their ballots to ensure that drop boxes are emptied by the voting deadline. Official administrators are clearly identifiable by the badge and vest they wear, she said. The code reads ""any voter who is in line at 8:00 p.m. at a ballot deposit site must be allowed to deposit his or her ballot."" It also says that county officials ""must prevent overflow of each ballot drop box to allow a voter to deposit his or her ballot securely.""  ""We must be able to identify voters who are in line at 8 p.m., and voters who arrive after,"" Garber said. ""By giving voters the option of depositing their ballot with an election administrator the line moves much more quickly, enabling election administrators to identify the vehicle that is last in line at 8 p.m."" Two election administrators are required to handle ballots at a drop box, and another person in the video, who was talking to the woman, was wearing a vest similar to the one the election worker wore.  Although not seen in the video, Garber said there were three election observers for the Republican Party at the drop box during the interaction who were monitoring the ballot collection.  ""Whether voters deposit their ballot in a ballot drop box, or deliver it directly to an election administrator, all ballots are placed and secured in official ballot bags for delivery to the elections office,"" she said. ""Certified election observers also have the ability to observe the delivery of official ballot bags to the elections office."" Claims questioning the legitimacy surrounding ballot drop boxes are not new. Drop boxes have been used for about 20 years across the country and grew in popularity in 2020 as elections officials grappled with how to safely conduct elections during a pandemic. Ballot drop boxes generally have more security features than typical stand-alone mailboxes. Voters can leave their ballots in the drop boxes, which are directly collected by local election officials, rather than voting in person or sending ballots through the mail.  Despite federal and state officials proclaiming the 2020 election was safe and secure, many politically conservative states have restricted or banned  drop boxes in the name of election security. Amy Lin, a spokeswoman for the Washington Secretary of State’s Office, said the collection procedures seen in the video are allowed by the state law requiring county officials to prevent overflow. The law also says that ballots from drop boxes must be transported to a counting center in ""secured transport containers,"" but doesn't specify the container type or how it’s secured.  ""Counties may use different receptacles, be they bags or bins/containers, to transport ballots,"" Lin said. A video shared on Facebook implies that a filmed interaction between an election worker in Washington state and a woman attempting to drop off their ballot is evidence of voter fraud. Washington state implemented a statewide vote-by-mail system in  2011 after initially allowing it on a county-by-county basis in 2005, and a state law requires counties to prevent long lines from forming at drop boxes.  It has been standard practice for the state to have two election administrators go to a drop box to begin collecting ballots ahead of the voting deadline. Physically collecting the ballots lets administrators whittle down the lines and monitor which voters are able to make it in on time.  We rate this claim False.  RELATED: All of our fact-checks about elections",/factchecks/2022/aug/10/facebook-posts/social-media-video-doesnt-show-evidence-voter-frau/

Easley Jr. mostly right about North Carolina ghost gun numbers
","A federal prosecutor says North Carolina law enforcement authorities are among the leaders in confiscating homemade guns that are hard to track.  Mike Easley Jr., the U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of North Carolina, stood on a stage in Raleigh on July 12 with leaders of local law enforcement agencies and announced indictments of 27 people from in and around the Raleigh area on gun and drug charges. Together, authorities seized significant quantities of cocaine, heroin, fentanyl, crack and more than two dozen firearms.  One seized weapon was a so-called ghost gun. These firearms are hard to trace because they’re often made privately using 3-D printers or assembled from a kit. Easley said ghost guns are a growing problem in North Carolina, adding that the state is ""among some of the top states in the country for the number of ghost guns that are seized as crime guns,"" he said. Is Easley right about North Carolina being among the leading states in ghost gun confiscations? When asked to verify the claim, Cari Boyce, a spokesperson for Easley’s office, pointed to an article that quoted the office of the U.S. Attorney for the Western District of North Carolina. The U.S. Attorney’s Office based its comments on data from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.  Boyce also referred PolitiFact NC to ATF. Although Easley’s comments reflect what federal agents have said, and North Carolina may have confiscated a high number of ghost guns in 2021, it’s difficult to know how these numbers stack up to other states.  The federal government hasn’t disclosed a state-by-state comparison of ghost gun seizures, according to Erik Longnecker, a deputy chief in ATF’s public affairs division, and some departments aren’t regularly reporting such seizures. President Joe Biden said in April that law enforcement agencies are finding more and more ghost guns at crime scenes and announced that the U.S. Department of Justice and the ATF would be cracking down on ghost gun makers and users involved in crimes. The Transportation Security Administration is on track to intercept a record number of guns this year, CNN reported, and there’s concern that advancements in technology will make the guns undetectable to metal detectors. About 20,000 suspected ghost guns across the country were confiscated and reported to ATF in 2021, Biden said, adding that last year’s numbers marked a tenfold increase since 2016. North Carolina seized more than 400 ghost guns last year, according to Corey Ray, a spokesperson for ATF in Charlotte. That figure represented a sevenfold increase over the previous year, although the 2020 figure may have been underreported.  Ray said in an email that North Carolina is among the ""top 10 states"" for recoveries, but he wouldn’t be more specific. He also said a state-by-state comparison isn't available to the public. Ray declined to release a ranking, saying that such information was sensitive. He added that he himself hasn’t seen a complete list or a specific breakdown.  Ray said Texas, Arizona, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia have reported some of the highest numbers of recoveries, and that North Carolina ""has seen similar recoveries."" But he also said tracking that information is difficult and that the quality of data varies widely among agencies across the country. As awareness and reporting increases, there will likely be more specific information available, Ray said, ""but for now those are all the details that can be shared.""  He added that the ATF has struggled to pinpoint how many ghost guns are being seized in the field because privately made firearms are such a new phenomenon and some law enforcement agencies are still learning how to recognize and document them.  ""Many agencies may still be in an educational phase — what makes a ghost gun a ghost gun, how are they constructed, how do you report such a device when recovered at a crime scene?"" Ray said in an email. So, although ATF says North Carolina is among the top states, as Easley claims, the agency still leaves us with an incomplete picture of how the state’s confiscation numbers compare with others. A PolitiFact North Carolina review of ghost gun confiscations mentioned in news articles found that the Tar Heel state’s 400 recoveries is likely lower than at least five other states.  California collected at least 2,400 among Los Angeles (1,949), Oakland (275) and San Francisco (190). New York confiscated at least 500 among New York City (375), Buffalo (70) and Rochester (48). Pennsylvania seized at least 600 between Philadelphia (571) and Pittsburgh (50). In Illinois, Chicago alone captured 455. Maryland recovered at least 423 between Baltimore (352) and Montgomery County (71). The District of Columbia also has confiscated at least 400. Easley Jr. said ""North Carolina is among some of the top states in the country for ghost guns seized as crime guns."" His office cited a claim by ATF, which said North Carolina is among the top states for ghost gun confiscations. But the agency hasn’t released a state-by-state breakdown. An ATF spokesperson also acknowledged that data is spotty because some law enforcement agencies aren’t reporting some ghost gun recoveries or are still learning how to document them. Easley’s statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, which is our definition of Mostly True.",/factchecks/2022/aug/10/michael-easley-jr/easley-jr-mostly-right-about-north-carolina-ghost-/

"['Candidate Biography', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Chris Abele']","
Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele says opponent Jeff Stone = Scott Walker
","
A doppelganger is a ghostly double of a living person. In German it means ""double walker.""

In the case of a new TV ad from Milwaukee County executive candidate Chris Abele, it would be ""double Scott Walker.""

Naturally, state Rep. Jeff Stone -- Abele’s opponent in the April 5 election -- is the alleged double.

In a new TV ad with B-movie special effects, Abele presents Stone and the new Republican governor as scary, bleached-out phantoms in ideological lockstep on the ""unfair"" state budget repair law. Stone, the ad claims, will copy a Walker agenda that has ""mismanaged"" Milwaukee County government.

""I thought he was Scott Walker’s twin,"" a man identified as David Crowley of Milwaukee County says into the camera. Later, he adds: ""Jeff Stone is Scott Walker.""

Last fall in the governor’s race, we looked at the Republican primary ad Scott Walker used to equate opponent Mark Neumann with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. We labeled Walker’s claim -- ""Mark Neumann = Nancy Pelosi,"" for shorthand -- and found it False.

Here, Abele’s ad essentially equates Stone with Walker.

So: Does Stone = Walker?

Of course, depending on where a voter sits, the degree of similarity could be considered a good thing or a bad thing.

But it’s worth evaluating, because both sides have made Stone’s ties to Walker a theme -- Stone ran as Walker’s logical successor for most of the race, and Abele is now pointing that out in a negative sense.

We asked the Abele campaign to back up the claim. They provided an analysis of voting records and pointed us to public statements and other evidence.

""They are overwhelmingly similar, and Jeff would represent a continuation of Scott Walker’s approach to governing,"" said Brandon Lorenz, Abele’s spokesman.

We’ll look at Walker and Stones’ statements about each other, as well as their voting histories, common causes, priorities, styles and backgrounds.

Walker and Stone have been linked closely because both are conservative Republicans from suburban Milwaukee communities who scored rare victories to succeed Democrats in office. They served in the Legislature together for about four years -- even carpooling together -- with Walker taking the higher profile.

Walker is seven years younger, at 43, but they got into elected politics within a year of each other. Stone started locally, as a Greenfield city alderman. Walker, from Wauwatosa, won a state Assembly seat.

Both considered the Milwaukee County exec’s job in 2002 after a pension scandal forced out F. Thomas Ament; only Walker jumped in. Stone helped Walker get elected. Now Stone wants to take over for Walker, and the governor says Stone -- whom he has endorsed and raised campaign money for -- would be a crucial local ally in reducing spending.

Stone and Walker’s statements:

Walker touted Stone in February 2010 as a worthy successor, saying he was ""interested in pursuing some of the same reforms and ideas"" that Walker has backed. That confirmed the impression at the Courthouse, dating back years, that Stone was the GOP’s candidate in waiting.

Stone has consistently praised Walker.

It should be noted though that from the start of his campaign he has said that his small-business experience would make him more focused on job creation than Walker, who Stone said was focused primarily on reforming county government after the pension scandal.

Are they close ideologically and by temperament?

Stone said in March 2011 that he and Walker share ""similar aspirations"" and ""a similarity in how we go about things. He urged a conservative audience: ""Vote for the person who’s going to move Milwaukee County forward along the lines of what Scott Walker has.""

Stone’s pre-primary campaign literature implored voters to back him to preserve gains being made during Walker’s tenure.

At times since Walker’s budget attracted massive protests in Madison this winter, Stone cautiously has tried to separate himself. He has said he will be less confrontational.

""I voted for the budget, but I'm not Scott Walker,"" said Stone. ""I'm Jeff Stone. I have a very different way of managing and doing business.""

Stone voted for Walker’s controversial budget-repair law, but later signaled he would not have tried to sharply curtail union bargaining rights if it had been up to him -- a position that earned him a Half Flip.

He voted for the business tax cuts Walker pushed in January’s special session.

Common Assembly voting history:

Stone and Walker overlapped in the Assembly from 1998 to 2002, when Walker was elected county executive. Stone has operated closer to power during his legislative career than did Walker (1993-2002). Stone served on the Legislature’s  budget-writing Joint Finance Committee. Walker made his mark mostly on law enforcement issues.

Research by Abele’s camp on more than 1,400 common votes shows Stone and Walker agreed 96 percent of the time. Stone doesn’t dispute that number.

There’s a limit, though, to how much insight comes from examining a mass of votes by two members of the same party, because most lawmakers vote the party line most of the time, and so many votes are minor.

So we looked at some ratings by a sampling of special interest groups on key legislation. The verdict: Stone and Walker have remarkably similar profiles, though not identical ones. 
Top priorities:

On the issues, Stone has adopted Walker’s signature anti-tax stance and similarly endorses smaller government. Stone and Walker jointly have proposed various tax cuts over the years. Like Walker, Stone has long been an active supporter of a photo ID requirement for voting.

The most notable difference: public transit.

Walker has been cool to expanding public transit for years, while Stone has made a regional transportation approach his signature issue.

""He’s been a great transit advocate for a decade,"" Kerry Thomas, interim executive director of Transit Now, a southeastern Wisconsin advocacy group, said of Stone.

There are limits to Stone’s support of new transportation options; he has spurned light rail, and he agreed with Walker’s stance against federal help for a high-speed train.

But Stone was a leading force behind creation of the Regional Transit Authority focused on commuter rail, and he has backed buses, and some -- but by no means all -- proposals for new funding options for public transit. Walker has taken a much tougher line against transit and new taxes or fees to pay for it. Stone is pledging an end to bus cuts seen under Walker and Ament.

Stone, like Walker, has backed freeway expansion.

Experience:

Stone emphatically says he is his own person and is going to ""do it my way.""

We asked him for examples of where he has broken with Walker -- and how his voting record compares.

He offered no criticism of Walker and pointed to no particular votes where they parted. But he notes correctly that he’s made a priority of regional transit, in contrast to Walker.

Their biggest difference, Stone said, is ""vastly different life experiences and what we’ve done in our career."" Stone has run a small printing company, while Walker worked briefly in the private sector before winning election.

He suggests that he will be more pragmatic and collegial than Walker.

""I have a very different way of managing and doing business that Scott Walker,"" he said at a candidate forum.

Stone has made a point of saying he will try to get along with the County Board and work with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett.

Let’s review.

Abele’s strongest evidence comes from Stone himself, who has aligned himself closely with Walker’s agenda and politics. Their voting histories are very similar, and they win very similar ratings from interest groups.

They are not indistinguishable, though: The transit issue illustrates Stone’s willingness to step out from Republican orthodoxy and work behind the scenes in a bipartisan fashion -- neither of which are Walker trademarks. Stone’s business experience is a notable biographical difference.

In the end, Abele’s equation (Stone = Walker) scores out as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/27/chris-abele/milwaukee-county-executive-candidate-chris-abele-s/

Wisconsin Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald says half of state residents are “on some kind of government handout”
","
Addressing the Wisconsin Republican Party’s annual convention on May 21, 2011, state Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, reflected on the transformational 2010 elections. The GOP swept to power, taking from Democrats the governor’s office as well as control of the Senate and Assembly.

""That election needed to happen. Our country is facing challenges we simply can’t ignore,"" Fitzgerald told hundreds of convention-goers at a Wisconsin Dells resort.

""Our government is growing too fast, too big; it’s becoming too expensive. One out of every five people in Wisconsin are on Medicaid or Medicare. One out of every two are on some kind of government handout.""

One out of every two people in Wisconsin -- half the state’s residents -- receive a ""government handout?""

That’s a lot of Wisconsinites.

We asked Fitzgerald’s spokesman, Andrew Welhouse, for evidence to back up the statement. Welhouse initially said his boss’ claim ""looks wrong, but the larger conversation about entitlements and government spending is long overdue.""

That’s not much of a defense.

Welhouse did cite this passage from an April 2011 analysis of federal data done by USA Today:

""A record 18.3 percent of the nation's total personal income was a payment from the government for Social Security, Medicare, food stamps, unemployment benefits and other programs in 2010. Wages accounted for the lowest share of income — 51 percent — since the government began keeping track in 1929.""

That all may be true. But it’s off point.  

The article indicates what percentage of Americans’ overall income comes from the government. But it says nothing about what percentage of individual Wisconsinites -- or Americans, for that matter -- receive government assistance.

We told Welhouse we still wanted to know what Fitzgerald defined as government handouts. When he called back, he said Fitzgerald told him he had meant to say that one in six Wisconsin residents -- not one in two -- get government handouts.

Welhouse didn’t say what Fitzgerald considered as handouts, but he provided another USA Today article, from August 2010. Analyzing state data, the newspaper found that government anti-poverty programs such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance served a record one in six Americans.

The article makes no mention of Wisconsin, however.

We contacted state agencies to see how many Wisconsinites receive government assistance from the four major programs cited in the second article that Welhouse provided. Here’s what we found: 

Since Wisconsin has about 5.65 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that means roughly one in five state residents is on Medicaid alone.

If you added the recipients in all four programs, the total would represent 2.16 million people, or more than one in three Wisconsinites. That would still be far short of the one in two that Fitzgerald claimed at the convention.

But the true figure is lower than 2.16 million because some people receive assistance from more than one of the programs. Based on the available information, we could not determine an exact number – nor could Fitzgerald.


We also contacted experts at four private organizations in Wisconsin that track government programs. None said they were aware of any study that attempted to determine what percentage of Wisconsin residents receives government assistance or a ""government handout.""

All of this is setting aside the question of what constitutes a handout, which is a subjective term.

The article cited by Fitzgerald’s aide to support the 1-in-2 claim included Social Security and Medicare, both of which workers pay into through payroll taxes. Many people would not consider those programs handouts.

Here’s the bottom line:

Fitzgerald made a bold statement at the state GOP convention -- that one out of every two Wisconsin residents ""is on some kind of government handout."" He was able to provide no evidence to back the claim, and even one of his aides essentially acknowledged it was wrong. The Senate leader later provided a different number, but the data he relied on is not specific to Wisconsin.

Wages accounted for the lowest share of income — 51 percent — since the government began keeping track in 1929.""

That all may be true. But it’s off point.  

The article indicates what percentage of Americans’ overall income comes from the government. But it says nothing about what percentage of individual Wisconsinites -- or Americans, for that matter -- receive government assistance.

We told Welhouse we still wanted to know what Fitzgerald defined as government handouts. When he called back, he said Fitzgerald told him he had meant to say that one in six Wisconsin residents -- not one in two -- get government handouts.

Welhouse didn’t say what Fitzgerald considered as handouts, but he provided another USA Today article, from August 2010. Analyzing state data, the newspaper found that government anti-poverty programs such as welfare, Medicaid, food stamps and unemployment insurance served a record one in six Americans.

The article makes no mention of Wisconsin, however.

We contacted state agencies to see how many Wisconsinites receive government assistance from the four major programs cited in the second article that Welhouse provided. Here’s what we found: 

Since Wisconsin has about 5.65 million people, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, that means roughly one in five state residents is on Medicaid alone.

If you added the recipients in all four programs, the total would represent 2.16 million people, or more than one in three Wisconsinites. That would still be far short of the one in two that Fitzgerald claimed at the convention.

But the true figure is lower than 2.16 million because some people receive assistance from more than one of the programs. Based on the available information, we could not determine an exact number – nor could Fitzgerald.


We also contacted experts at four private organizations in Wisconsin that track government programs. None said they were aware of any study that attempted to determine what percentage of Wisconsin residents receives government assistance or a ""government handout.""

All of this is setting aside the question of what constitutes a handout, which is a subjective term.

The article cited by Fitzgerald’s aide to support the 1-in-2 claim included Social Security and Medicare, both of which workers pay into through payroll taxes. Many people would not consider those programs handouts.

Here’s the bottom line:

Fitzgerald made a bold statement at the state GOP convention -- that one out of every two Wisconsin residents ""is on some kind of government handout."" He was able to provide no evidence to back the claim, and even one of his aides essentially acknowledged it was wrong. The Senate leader later provided a different number, but the data he relied on is not specific to Wisconsin.
