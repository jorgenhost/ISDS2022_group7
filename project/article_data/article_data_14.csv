The facts of whale life: Do male whales ‘help’ other males mate?
","Woe, to be a third wheel. Or a third whale.  At least, a recent Facebook post equates the two.  ""Third whaling,"" says the Aug. 19 post, which features an illustration of two whales seemingly mating and a third underneath them. ""So apparently when two large whales do the nasty there’s sometimes this one bro who just sort of holds them up so they don’t float off. Nature is beautiful.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Nature is beautiful, but what’s happening here is a little less love, a little more war.  ""Good story!"" Scott Kraus, chief marine mammals scientist at the Anderson-Cabot Center for Ocean Life, said about the Facebook post. ""But entirely fictional. Why one male would help another secure a copulation? It makes no sense biologically to give up creating your genetically related offspring to help your buddy."" Many observations of mating groups in right, bowhead and gray whales have led people to think males are helping one another to get the female, Kraus said. ""But it is mostly competition, pure and simple.""  Quoting from the book ""Gray Whales"" by David G. Gordon and Alan Baldridge, a 2000 New York Times Q&A says that ""two courting bulls often follow the same cow, forming tightly knit trios that remain intact right up to the moment of conception.""  The idea that any extra males held the mating whales together to brace them has been ""mostly dismissed as a misinterpretation of what is going on in a process that is difficult to study,"" according to the Times. Different whale species behave differently. The contests between male humpback whales can be violent, or deadly, according to a 2008 Smithsonian Magazine story, as male whales attack each other underwater vying for the female’s attention.  In August 2000, meanwhile, a female North American Right whale was observed by scientists simultaneously having sex with two males. Kraus told us that when female whales remain with their blowholes upright and swimming forward, they may be ensuring that only males fit enough to keep up and hold their breath for long periods of time can mate with her. In right whales, he said, ""it’s likely that the female instigates this behavior by calling — the more males, the more competition, the more likely she is to get the best male."" A 2015 video posted on YouTube by National Geographic shows gray whales the magazine says ""may be engaged in a ‘three way.’ "" ""It’s common to see two male gray whales courting a female,"" the text that appears over the video reads. ""They take turns attempting to mate with her. Body alignment is important in these 35-feet plus mammals. One male supports the female as the other attempts to mate with her."" An accompanying article quotes a gray whale researcher saying: ""Many times gray whales do mating triads, and at times one male props the other male up to mate and then they flip flop positions.""  These statements seem to support the Facebook post, but we wanted to know more. We reached out to Mark Girardeau, the wildlife photographer who used a drone to record the footage of the whales that National Geographic posted. He told us that the information in the New York Times Q&A that challenges the notion of a third ""helper"" whale is accurate. ""Many species have never even been documented mating, so we just don’t know,"" he said. ""Gray whales were previously thought to have only mated in threes for support, but I’ve also recently found out that it is just two males competing, and it’s just a matter of which bull’s semen does the job.""  We asked Trevor Branch, a professor at the School of Aquatic and Fisheries Sciences at the University of Washington, about the ""third whaling"" claims.  ""Sounds super unlikely,"" he told us in an email. ""Often there are two males competing to mate with the female, and it might appear (as) if one is below (and) that it’s supporting the mating couple.""  He pointed us to a recent article in Marine Mammal Science that he notes was ""about this exact scenario in blue whales."" The article says that escorting behavior, in which a male accompanies a female, is known to happen among animals including humpback whales, African elephants and some primate species.  ""Escorting allows a male to defend a female, limiting access of other males to the female and thereby increasing the likelihood of siring potential offspring,"" the article says. ""Rival males may challenge the escorting male to take his place… . In the Gulf of St. Lawrence, it is often observed that when a blue whale pair is joined by a third whale — usually a male — the trio starts coursing, racing high out of the water involving vigorous surface displays causing explosive splashes and bow waves. This behavior can either end with the intruding male leaving the pair or the primary escort being replaced by the intruding male."" Rob Williams, chief scientist with Oceans Initiative, told us that back in the 1980s, there was a theory of mating trios including ""helpers"" among gray whales. ""But I think even the authors noted that was speculation,"" Williams said. ""I’m not aware of any genetic evidence emerging over the last 30 years that those third whales are actually helpers."" Philip Clapham, former program leader of the Cetacean Assessment and Ecology Program and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, was blunter when we asked him about the Facebook post. ""The idea that one male holds up a mating pair is complete and utter bulls---,"" he said.  In some species of whales, multiple males compete for the same female,"" he told us. Gray whales are more sedate than, say, humpback whales, but that underwater melee is competition, not cooperation.

There’s no evidence that Rihanna or these other celebrities are sending water to the Amazon
","As wildfires continue to consume large swaths of the Amazon rainforest, some social media users are crediting celebrities with trying to help extinguish them. In an Instagram post published Sept. 2, one user published a screenshot of a tweet that claims the singer Rihanna has hired ""five planes that carried 90,000 liters of water to support the fire control"" in the Amazon rainforest. Brazil’s National Institute for Space Research estimates there have been 90,000 fires throughout the region this year. ""We luv Rihanna,"" the Instagram user wrote about the artist.

We also reached out to the public relations agency that represents Rihanna for more details. We’ll update this story if we hear back. A search for the original tweet pictured in the Instagram post turned up several examples of the same claim, although with different celebrities. Over the past week, tweeters have claimed that Selena Gomez, rapper Bhad Bhabie, Nicki Minaj and other public figures have also hired five planes to carry 90,000 liters of water to the Amazon. An advanced Twitter search of Rihanna’s tweets revealed that the artist has never tweeted about the Amazon rainforest. She also hasn’t mentioned the fires on her Instagram in the past several weeks. Finally, we couldn’t find any news stories mentioning Rihanna even speaking about the Amazon fires, much less hiring planes to carry water there. It’s reasonable to assume a celebrity as well-known as Rihanna would receive at least some press attention for such a move. Rihanna’s foundation, for example, has been involved with other humanitarian efforts, such as giving grants to nonprofits for disaster relief. But when it comes to this rainforest claim, we couldn’t find any evidence to support the notion that she or any of the other celebrities mentioned on Twitter had hired aircraft to help put out the Amazon fires.  We do know, however, that the Brazilian military has used warplanes to dump water on the blazes.  The Facebook post is inaccurate.

Darling whiffs on claim about Evers and state jobs agency
","Wisconsin’s economic development agency has been a lightning rod for years. The public-private partnership — officially the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. — oversees grants and loans given to businesses in exchange for the creation of new jobs. It has drawn criticism for bad loans, failures to verify created jobs, negative state audits and most recently its role in bringing the Foxconn Technology Group plant to Racine County. Gov. Tony Evers even pledged to de-fund the agency in his first budget, though he later backed down from that position (earning a Full Flop rating from us). Now the relationship between Evers and WEDC has a new wrinkle. Addressing the state Legislature’s Joint Finance Committee, state Sen. Alberta Darling, R-River Hills, claimed the Democratic governor had developed quite an affinity for the Republican-appointed head of the agency. ""Our Gov. Evers asked the director of WEDC to stay on, because he was really concerned that the good trends that were happening with WEDC would not be able to continue with a really quick turnover,"" Darling, the committee’s co-chair, said at the Sept. 4, 2019, meeting. ""The director to his credit, stayed."" Hmm. Unraveling this seemingly simple claim takes us on a meandering path that includes lame-duck laws, appeals courts and resignations. Let’s get started. This claim centers on Mark Hogan, a former banker appointed as CEO of WEDC in September 2015. Hogan was named to the post by Gov. Scott Walker, who had the power to name a CEO with state Senate approval. But after Evers defeated Walker in the November 2018 election, Republicans worried he would make good on his pledge to dissolve WEDC. A series of lame-duck bills finalized in December 2018 (while Republicans still controlled all of state government) included a temporary turnover of power: Republicans would oversee WEDC until Sept. 1, 2019. Republicans said at the time they wanted to temporarily gain control to show Evers that WEDC works well and persuade him to keep it as is. Hogan said he did not seek the change. Meanwhile, Hogan announced in June 2019 that he would be leaving the agency in fall 2019, which officials said he had previously told both Walker and Evers. In an Aug. 26 letter to Evers, Hogan revealed his last day would be Sept. 3. Evers tweeted a thanks to the outgoing Hogan that day. ""Thank you ... for your leadership and service to our state,"" the governor said. ""I have appreciated you and your candor, collaboration, and dedication to our state. Sending you my sincerest respect and gratitude--Kathy and I wish you the very best in retirement."" The timeline doesn’t allow much space for Evers to extend Hogan's stay, since Hogan left the agency two days after Evers gained oversight power. And Evers’ staff said no such request was made — in September or before. ""The law required us to keep him on. At no point did the governor ask Mark to stay on post-Sept. 1,"" Evers spokeswoman Melissa Baldauff said in an email. ""There was not a scenario when Mark said he planned to leave earlier and the governor asked him to stay. That never happened."" So what is Darling talking about? The complicating factors here are the court challenges to the lame-duck laws. A Dane County judge struck down the laws and legislative confirmation of a slew of Walker’s last-minute appointments in March 2019, after which Evers withdrew 82 of those appointments.  Reporter Scott Bauer of the Associated Press noted on Twitter that ruling also gave Evers power to appoint a new leader for WEDC. But Evers said he had no immediate plans to do so — and never took any such action. An appeals court stayed the Dane County ruling six days later, restoring the lame-duck laws and returning WEDC oversight to Republicans until Sept. 1. Three other lawsuits over the lame-duck laws are ongoing, but for now at least most of the laws are in effect. Defending Darling’s claim, spokesman Bob Delaporte pointed to Evers’ inaction in the wake of the court case and times the governor spoke positively of Hogan’s work and the relationship between the two. ""If the governor’s office never formally asked for Hogan to stay, they were at the very least pleased enough with his performance to never ask him to leave. The governor had an opportunity to make a change at WEDC and didn’t,"" Delaporte said in an email. ""I think it’s fair to assume that if you have the chance to remove someone from an agency and don’t you must like the performance and direction that person is providing."" But that was not Darling’s claim. She claimed Evers asked him to stay on — and continue after the Sept. 1 changeover date. Darling’s office provided no evidence of that. Darling told her legislative colleagues the governor asked Hogan to stay on as head of WEDC.  Though Evers was mostly unable to address Hogan’s post before Sept. 1, court cases did create a brief window where he could have made a change. But declining to make a change amid a contentious court battle is not the same thing as asking Hogan to stay on — which implies he intended to leave earlier. Hogan by all accounts simply informed both Evers and Walker that he planned to leave this fall, then did so.

It’s true: There are more governors who have worn blackface than black governors
","An activist on Twitter posted an eye-popping statistic about the governors currently in office in the United States. ""America has more governors who’ve worn blackface than black governors,"" said Samuel Sinyangwe, co-founder of Campaign Zero, an activist group focused on police violence, in a viral Aug. 30 tweet that was cited by anchor Chuck Todd of NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""  America has more governors who’ve worn blackface than black governors. https://t.co/VHq1Cl4Xkl This claim was easy to fact-check: There are zero black governors for the 50 states. But there are two governors who’ve apologized for wearing blackface.  Sinyangwe’s tweet came on the heels of an Aug. 29 report that Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey had apologized after audio emerged of a 52-year-old radio interview in which she talked about wearing blackface for a student skit at Auburn University. In February, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam said he was one of two men pictured in a racist yearbook photograph from 1984, which showed one man dressed in blackface and another in a Ku Klux Klan robe. At the time, Northam did not say which costume he was wearing. But he later recanted his apology, saying neither man in the photograph was him.  An investigation commissioned by Eastern Virginia Medical School, where Northam got his medical degree, did not conclude whether Northam was in the picture from its 1984 yearbook. ""With respect to the photograph on Gov. Northam’s personal page, we could not conclusively determine the identity of either individual depicted in the photograph,"" the final report said. ""The governor himself has made inconsistent public statements in this regard."" When Northam said the investigation ""confirmed what I said all along, that I’m not in the picture,"" we rated his statement False. Depending on whether you count Northam, there’s at least one governor — and possibly a second — who has owned up to wearing blackface in the past.  Meanwhile, there are currently no black governors, according to Rutgers University’s Center on the American Governor. Out of 50 sitting governors, 47 are white, and the remaining three are Hispanic, Asian American and Native American. Only two African Americans have been elected governor, with the most recent being Democrat Deval Patrick, who was voted into office in Massachusetts in 2006. Democrat Douglas Wilder had previously been elected as Virginia’s governor, a post he held from 1990 to 1994. Before Wilder’s election, the only black governor had been P. B. S. Pinchback, who stepped in as Louisiana’s governor for 34 days in 1872 while the incumbent faced impeachment, according to CBS News. In 2008, Democrat David Paterson was also appointed governor of New York after Eliot Spitzer resigned. Democrats Stacey Abrams, Andrew Gillum and Ben Jealous, all black, lost gubernatorial races in Georgia, Florida and Maryland in 2018. ""When a lot of African Americans start their political careers, they often run in places with large or growing African American populations,"" said Andra Gillespie, professor of political science at Emory University. ""Given the fact that there is no state that has a majority black population, that presents a challenge."" That’s why black candidates have been more successful getting elected as mayors of cities or members of Congress from urban districts with heavy black populations, said John Weingart, director of the Center on the American Governor. ""The two elected governors, certainly in the case of Deval Patrick, have been considered successful governors,"" he added. ""So it’s not like getting one in necessarily opens the door."" There have still been plenty of predominantly white jurisdictions that have put black politicians in various offices, Gillespie said, but the ""historical norm"" is that black candidates fare better when black voters can get to the polls. For much of American history, that wasn’t possible. ""For nearly 100 years after black rights to vote were protected by the 15th Amendment, a number of the states in which African Americans lived came up with ingenious ways to prevent African Amerricans from being able to exercise their right to vote,"" Gillespie said. ""What that did was shut off an opportunity for blacks to be able to run for office."" In an email to PolitiFact, Sinyangwe noted that the governor of the U.S. Virgin Islands, Albert Bryan, is black. The U.S. Virgin Islands is a territory, not a state. Sinyangwe said, ""America has more governors who’ve worn blackface than black governors."" There are currently no black governors in the United States. But there’s at least one, Ivey, who has admitted to wearing blackface in the past, and Northam has been accused of the same.

Is Trump’s trade war to blame for the Amazon wildfires? That’s a reach
","At first glance, U.S.-Chinese trade tensions may seem unrelated to the surge of wildfires in the Amazon rainforest. But one Democratic presidential candidate is linking the environmental devastation to President Donald Trump’s trade war with Beijing. John Delaney’s argument is that tit-for-tat tariffs between the economic superpowers have decimated U.S. soybean exports to China. As a result, he said, farmers in Latin America are now incentivized to take extreme measures to feed their newly expanded Chinese market.  ""In reality, (the Amazon wildfires are) directly related to trade. The fact that U.S. farmers can't sell soybeans to China has created an opportunity for Brazil to sell soybeans to China,"" John Delaney said Aug. 27 on Fox News. ""As a result, farmers are tearing down the Amazon to grow soybeans."" We found that while those two dots — the U.S.-Chinese trade war and Amazon wildfires — can be connected, Delaney exaggerated the link.   Experts who study ancient environments say farmers have been burning the Amazon rainforest for millenia. So why have this year’s fires have garnered so much attention? Because there haven’t been this many fires since 2012.  More than 95,000 fires were ablaze in the Brazilian Amazon at last count, which represents a 59% increase from around this time last year, according to the Brazilian National Institute for Space Research. The number changes daily. While this year is not on track to be record-breaking, the amount of fire is ""relatively high compared to recent years,"" Mikaela Weisse and Sarah Ruiz of the World Resource Institute wrote. Environmental experts believe humans are responsible for the vast majority of these wildfires, intentionally or not So what’s that got to do with U.S.-Chinese trade relations? Under Delaney’s logic, Trump’s trade war with China set in motion retaliatory tariffs against U.S. soybean farmers. And increasingly, Chinese soybean buyers have looked to farmers in Brazil, where Amazon lands could be used to cultivate the crop — even if it means burning rainforest to clear more arable land.   The U.S. Soybean Export Council, a trade association, expects American soybean exports to China this year to be about one-third of last year. At the same time, Brazil has replaced the United States as the biggest supplier of soybeans, according to the South China Morning Post. While Brazil has been selling soybeans to China for years, the U.S.-Chinese trade war has been a welcomed development for Brazil’s soybean farmers. ""We are prepared to take advantage of the trade war to increase our business with China and further build trade relations,"" Igor Brandao, chief of the agribusiness division of Brazil’s trade promotion agency, told the South China Morning Post.    We reached out to experts from a variety of fields — economics, trade, politics, environmental sciences — who told is that no single factor alone is responsible for the uptick in Amazon wildfires this year. While the U.S.-Chinese trade war is certainly one factor, it should not be given the most weight, some experts told us. The more direct cause lies with decisions by Brazil’s political and business leaders.  South American farmers and ranchers have long sought more Amazon lands to raise cattle and grow crops. In countries where the Amazon lies — Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, and Peru — there are laws against deforestation, but enforcement has been inconsistent.    While previous Brazilian presidents have exercised relatively tighter control over the rainforest, the administration of President Jair Bolsonaro, who took office at the start of 2019, has taken a more hands-off approach in order to encourage more agricultural activity and development. Some experts we spoke to said this was the true spark — not strained U.S.-Chinese trade relations. ""The main economic reason for the fires is pent-up demand — under previous Brazilian presidents — for new acreage for cattle and crops,"" said Gary Hufbauer, a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, which supports free trade. ""The Bolsonaro government relaxed controls and the burning escalated. ""While I deplore Trump’s trade war,"" he said, ""I think the tie to Amazon fires is remote."" A National Geographic analysis of data from the Global Fire Emissions Database also concluded that the uptick in fires is a result of the Bolsonaro administration’s laxer regulation. ""In Brazil — which controls the majority of the vast forest — regulations were put into place over a decade ago to curb the expanse of deforestation,"" National Geographic reported. ""But these rules have been loosened by the new Brazilian administration, and consequently fires are spiking."" Delaney’s campaign pointed us to a number of press reports that drew a connection between Trump’s trade war with China and the burning Amazon rainforests.  The Trump administration's trade war with China has ""provided some economic incentive to clear the Amazon forests via fire,"" said Ross Burkhart, a political science professor at Boise State University who specializes in environmental policy. But he added that any connection is an indirect one, and somewhat beside the main point.   ""Focusing on that impact takes away from the more direct causal factors,"" he said, ""which in my view involve internal decisions made by Brazilian agricultural, business, and political leaders."" Delaney said the Amazon rainforest fires are ""directly related to trade"" tensions between the United States and China. U.S.-Chinese trade tensions have expanded South American farmers’ opportunity to sell soybeans in China, which in turn has created an economic incentive to burn Amazon land so it can be used for crop production. But a more direct cause of the surge in wildfires is the loosening of deforestation rules under the current Brazilian government that favor the country’s agricultural and business interests.

Trump said ‘almost all models predicted’ Dorian would hit Alabama. He’s wrong
","Armed with spaghetti models and a Sharpie-doctored map, President Donald Trump defended his efforts to declare that once upon a time, Alabama was poised to face Hurricane Dorian’s wrath. He even went so far as to say that there was a 95% chance that Alabama was on the hurricane’s path. But Trump’s receipts don’t check out. This is the story of how the president mangled government models of the storm to blow the forecast way out of proportion and misinform Americans.  The White House did not answer our questions But by the end of the day the White House issued a statement by Rear Admiral Peter J. Brown, Homeland Security and Counterterrorism Advisor, who defended Trump. Brown said that he shared with Trump the spaghetti models that showed possible storm impacts outside the official forecast cone and that forecasts showed the possibility of tropical storm force winds hitting Alabama. Over several days, Trump heard criticism from the media and meteorologists about his weekend warnings that even Alabama would ""get a piece of"" Dorian or ""will most likely be hit (much) harder than anticipated."" So, as he briefed reporters on the latest updates Sept. 4, he asked acting Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kevin K. McAleenan to display a chart of the ""original"" forecast.  #Sharpiegate was born: The hurricane’s cone had been extended in black ink to include a section of southeast Alabama, even though it didn’t match anything produced by the government’s hurricane forecasters.  Speaking again to reporters Sept. 4, Trump said he ""didn’t know"" who altered the map. Trump also had this to say, alluding to yet another model that he thought would prove his point:  ""I know that Alabama was in the original forecast. They thought it would get it as a piece of it. It was supposed to go — actually, we have a better map than that, which is going to be presented, where we had many lines going directly — many models — each line being a model.  And they were going directly through. And, in all cases, Alabama was hit — if not lightly, in some cases pretty hard. Georgia, Alabama — it was a different route. They actually gave that a 95% chance probability."" Forecasters did not give Alabama a 95% chance of being hit, and the ""better map"" Trump shared hours later in a tweet also did not show most models hitting Alabama. Trump’s tweet showed an Aug. 28 model of spaghetti plots for the hurricane’s path appearing in countless jiggly lines aimed at the southeastern United States. ""This was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies!"" This was the originally projected path of the Hurricane in its early stages. As you can see, almost all models predicted it to go through Florida also hitting Georgia and Alabama. I accept the Fake News apologies! pic.twitter.com/0uCT0Qvyo6 The spaghetti plots show various models up to 10 days out and requires professional interpretation. The National Hurricane Center examines those models and then comes up with a five-day forecast.  ""The 'spaghetti tracks' from the forecast model are useful for hurricane forecasters to consider,"" said Judith Curry, an atmospheric scientist and founder of the Climate Forecast Applications Network. ""But they are easily misinterpreted by the public."" And apparently, the president. ""There was absolutely not ever a 95% chance that Alabama would get hit, let alone ‘pretty hard’ or ‘in all cases,’"" said Brian McNoldy, a tropical cyclone researcher at the University of Miami who has been critical of Trump’s statements about Hurricane Dorian and other topics.  A spaghetti plot shows multiple computer models that predict a storm’s path up to 10 days. There are about 100 models from various sources including the government and private firms. Some meteorologists only pay attention to some of them. The key is not to pluck out a particular strand but to look for consensus and watch the trend over time. While the graphic Trump tweeted did show a few lines going through Alabama, McNoldy said the lines ""are not all equals and should not be interpreted as such."" ""Even so, only a small handful were there, hardly a 95% chance or ‘in all cases,’ "" he said. The fine print of the graphic says ""If anything on this graphic causes confusion, ignore the entire product."" As for Trump’s potentially Sharpied cone map, that also looks like a case of exaggerating one of many five-day forecasts.  One map from Aug. 30 showed the outer edge of the five-day cone just barely nipping the southeast corner of Alabama. Most from around that time showed the cone centered over Florida and the southeast Atlantic coast. The edge of the cone represents a two-thirds probability of the center of the storm tracking within it, using average track errors from the previous five years, McNoldy said. By the weekend, there was growing consensus that Hurricane Dorian would turn north before it eventually reached Florida, Curry said. ""There was never a substantial probability of it reaching Alabama,"" she said. There was a period of time when the Gulf really was threatened in the extended range beyond five days, said Keith G. Blackwell and Andrew Murray, two University of South Alabama meteorologists.  But the five-day forecasts from the National Hurricane Center focused on Florida and then the southeastern coast days before Trump started on Alabama. (Trump has since highlighted an Alabama National Guard warning on Twitter about the storm forecast. The view was not shared by the meteorologists we reached.) The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s advisory showing tropical storm force wind probabilities did show at certain points a chance that Alabama would face strong winds over the next few days. For example, a 2 p.m. Aug. 30 update showed anywhere from a 5 to 30% chance that Alabama would face winds at 39 miles per hour. Ultimately, there was a very small chance that Dorian could have reached Alabama, but Trump overstated what earlier predictions showed. ""In no way was Alabama a likely target, but there was a small chance that Dorian could have entered the Gulf of Mexico,"" Colorado State University atmospheric scientist Phil Klotzbach said. ""But, I think the key point is that NOAA never discussed that scenario, because it was likely at least one week out from when this guidance was available."" Trump tweeted that originally ""almost all models predicted"" Dorian would hit Alabama. He linked to a spaghetti models map that showed various models through the next 10 days. While some of those models showed Dorian hitting Alabama, Trump has grossly overstated what it showed. The National Hurricane Center takes these models and then comes up with a five-day forecast. It’s ridiculous for him to use the models to conclude that it showed almost all predicted the storm would hit Alabama, which matches our definition of Pants on Fire.  ",/factchecks/2019/sep/05/donald-trump/trump-said-almost-all-models-predicted-dorian-woul/

No. Biden’s recounting of his position doesn’t match the public comments he made right before and after the war started. During that time, Biden acknowledged frustrations with how the United States was heading into war, but said he supported the president. Biden for years stood by his vote for a resolution that paved the way for the war, even though he also criticized the Bush administration’s strategy — saying the United States went to war too soon, without enough troops, and without enough countries supporting the effort. Path to Iraq War In 2002, President George W. Bush argued that Iraqi president Saddam Hussein had chemical and biological weapons, sought nuclear weapons, supported terrorism, and threatened peace. In October 2002, then-U.S. Sen. Biden voted in favor of a resolution that authorized Bush to enforce ''all relevant'' United Nations Security Council resolutions on Iraq and if needed, to use military force against Iraq. In a Senate floor speech before voting for the resolution, Biden said that ""failure to overwhelmingly support"" the resolution was ""likely to enhance the prospects that war will occur."" The objective of the resolution was to compel Iraq to destroy its weapons of mass destruction, Biden said. Biden left open the possibility that Hussein might ""miscalculate"" and ""misjudge"" U.S. resolve. In that event, Biden said, use of military force might be needed, with the support of others, or alone if it came to that. ""If it comes to war,"" Biden said, ""the president, I am confident, will go to the American people. In a speech last week he made a compelling case that Iraq's failure to disarm is our problem as well as the world's. But as I said, he has not yet made the case to the American people that the United States may have to solve this problem alone or with relatively few people or has he told us of the sacrifices that such a course of action will involve. I am confident that he will do so if and when it proves necessary."" The United States invaded Iraq on March 20, 2003, and the war officially ended in late 2011. No weapons of mass destruction were found. CNN interviewed Biden on March 19, 2003, as U.S.-led troops pushed closer to the Iraqi border. Then-CNN anchor Judy Woodruff asked Biden if Senate Democratic Minority Leader Tom Daschle had gone ""over the line"" by saying that he regretted that one life would be lost because Bush failed at diplomacy. ""No, I think what you saw is a sense of frustration,"" Biden said, adding that the frustration related to ""the lost opportunities of maybe being able to do this with others, maybe, if we had others with us, not even having to go to war."" Woodruff also pressed Biden on comments by other Democratic lawmakers who said they supported the troops, but reserved the right to criticize Bush. ""I support the president. I support the troops. We should make no distinction,"" Biden said. ""We should have one voice going out to the whole world that we're together. There's plenty to criticize this president for. Let's get this war done."" Biden also said that at a caucus meeting that day, his suggestion was to send a message that ""when that first tank crosses that line, we should be on the floor of the United States Senate and every capital in the world hear one voice from both parties, saying, we support the troops. We support the president. And this is the single most important thing we do, and show it by our actions.""  So despite frustrations on how the United States was going into war, lawmakers should ultimately support the president, Biden said. Biden’s comments after the war started A week after the war started, Biden in a Senate floor statement said he supported a concurrent resolution that expressed the United States’ gratitude to other nations who were supporting the United States in disarming Iraq.  ""God willing, this war will continue to go well... casualties on all sides will be few... and victory will be swift,"" Biden said March 27, 2003. ""And working with the international community, we will put Iraq on the path to a pluralistic and democratic society."" At a Brookings Institution event in July 2003, about four months after the Iraq started, Biden embraced his vote, but also criticized the Bush administration.  ""Nine months ago, I voted with my colleagues to give the president of the United States of America the authority to use force, and I would vote that way again today,"" Biden said. Biden said it was the correct vote because Hussein for more than a decade had defied U.N. security resolutions, failed to account for huge gaps in weapons declarations documented by U.N. weapons inspectors, and refused to abide by conditions set for him. Still, the Bush administration erred in its approach to Hussein, Biden added.  ""For me, the issue was never whether we had to deal with Saddam, but when and how we dealt with Saddam,"" Biden said July 2003. ""And it's precisely the when and how that I think this administration got wrong. We went to war too soon. We went to war with too few troops. We went to war without the world, when we could have had many with us, and we're paying the price for it now."" Biden in a 2004 op-ed again justified his vote and cast blame on the Bush administration’s actions. Authorizing use of force ""made sense,"" Biden wrote, because Hussein had ""spent a decade playing cat and mouse with the U.N. inspectors sent to verify his compliance with the Security Council's demands."" ""I've asked myself many times whether there is more Congress could and should have done to slow the rush to war, even after we authorized the use of force, but the truth is that many of us repeatedly warned the administration about the mistakes it was making,"" Biden added. In a November 2005 interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Biden was asked if his 2002 vote was a mistake. ""It was a mistake,"" Biden said. ""It was a mistake to assume the president would use the authority we gave him properly. … We gave the president the authority to unite the world to isolate Saddam. And the fact of the matter is, we went too soon. We went without sufficient force. And we went without a plan."" Biden spokesman Andrew Bates said that Biden as senator called for investigation of the Bush administration’s ""intelligence failures and blasted their abandonment of diplomacy and extremely flawed prosecution of the war."" ""He worked in good faith with the Bush administration to ensure that the United Nations weapons inspections in Iraq could resume, which is why he voted yes,"" Bates said. ""However, his good faith was not reciprocated and even once inspections were back on track the Bush administration plunged the nation into war."" Our ruling Referring to the Iraq War, Biden said, ""immediately, the moment it started, I came out against the war at that moment."" That’s not the case. The public record shows that immediately before and after the United States invaded Iraq in March 2003, Biden supported the president. He also on multiple occasions for years justified his vote on a resolution that authorized the use of force against Iraq. Biden lamented that the United States did not have the support of more nations and gradually criticized the Bush administration’s strategy. But his claim of an ""immediate"" opposition to the war isn’t accurate. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2019/sep/05/joe-biden/oe-biden-falsely-claims-he-immediately-opposed-ira/

The same figure can be found on the U.S. House list, as well. The $6 per diem is reflected in a report by the Congressional Research Service, too. According to congressional session archives, the first session of Congress in 1789 lasted 168 days. If members were paid $6 for each of those days, they made $1,008 from March 4 to Sept. 29, 1789.

Whoopi Goldberg warned about another Hollywood blacklist. Here’s what she was talking about
","""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg slammed the stars of ""Will & Grace"" for demanding a list of people attending a big-ticket fundraiser for President Donald Trump. Actors Debra Messing and Eric McCormack had called for The Hollywood Reporter to publish a list of people going to the Sept. 17 fundraiser for Trump in Beverly Hills. ""Hey, @THR, kindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don’t wanna work with,"" McCormack tweeted Aug. 30.   Hey, @THR, kindly report on everyone attending this event, so the rest of us can be clear about who we don’t wanna work with. Thx. https://t.co/7W3xPG3bI2 ""Please print a list of all attendees please,"" Messing tweeted the next day. ""The public has a right to know.""  Please print a list of all attendees please. The public has a right to know. https://t.co/YV4UoxrPHI In her rebuke, Goldberg compared the tweets to the Hollywood blacklists that sought to weed out communist sympathizers from the film industry in the mid 1900s. ""The last time people did this, people ended up killing themselves,"" she said during the show’s season premiere. ""This is not a good idea, OK? Your idea of who you don’t want to work with is your personal business."" ""Do not encourage people to print out lists because the next list that comes out, your name will be on, and then people will be coming after you,"" she added. Then, Goldberg gave this history lesson: ""We had something called a blacklist, and a lot of really good people were accused of stuff. Nobody cared whether it was true or not. They were accused, and they lost their right to work ... Think about it. Read about it. Remember what the blacklist actually meant to people and don’t encourage anyone, anyone, to do it."" We thought some viewers might not know what Goldberg was talking about, so we contacted a few expert historians to fill in the gaps. They said her account was pretty much spot-on. The blacklist Goldberg mentioned took place during the 1940s and 1950s, as the Cold War between the United States and Soviet Union heated up. This era — known in the history books as the ""Red Scare"" — was defined by an anti-communist crusade led by the late Sen. Joseph McCarthy of Wisconsin, who targeted federal government employees suspected of harboring communist beliefs.  But it wasn’t McCarthy who initiated the Hollywood blacklist. In October 1947, the House Un-American Activities Committee, called HUAC, launched an investigation into the Hollywood film industry, which anti-communist lawmakers worried was pushing communist propaganda. It ended up subpoenaing more than 40 industry figures.  Many of the names came from a series of columns written by the publisher and founder of the Hollywood Reporter that identified communists and communist sympathizers, according to the magazine, which looked back at its own role in a 2012 report. A group of screenwriters and directors later known as the ""Hollywood 10"" denounced the investigation as a violation of their constitutional rights. For their trouble, they were cited for contempt of Congress, tried and found guilty. Each spent a year in jail and paid a $1,000 fine. They were also blacklisted by studio executives. Eric Johnston, then the president of the Motion Picture Association of America, said in a press release that the association’s members would not re-employ the Hollywood 10 and would not knowingly hire other communists. The House committee probe was the ""starting gun for the Hollywood blacklist,"" said Thomas Doherty, professor of American studies at Brandeis University. ""It spurred the MPAA to issue its infamous Waldorf Statement in November 1947 saying the studios would not hire communists."" As the committee continued its investigations through the 1950s, the blacklist grew to include about 325 screenwriters, actors and directors, before ending in the 1960s, according to History.com.  Recent reports are mixed as to how many blacklisted workers were actually Communist party members or sympathizers and how many were merely accused, but according to History.com, the Hollywood 10 were ""admitted communists."" ""Various groups and individuals, almost all deeply rightwing, were involved in calling for a blacklist and naming the ‘guilty,’ but acceptance of that guilt by the liberal mainstream was widespread until the later 1950s,"" said Peter Buhle, retired senior lecturer at Brown University. Some people dealt with the blacklist by moving abroad or writing scripts under pseudonyms or in the name of others. But most had trouble keeping their careers. ""For the majority of those blacklisted, there was no career rehabilitation, their lives were ruined,"" Buhle said.  Doherty noted that actor Philip Loeb killed himself in 1955 after being blacklisted off his TV show ""The Goldbergs"" in 1951, and he said a number of other actors suffered premature deaths that are ""often considered to have been precipitated by the stress of the blacklist."" ""Whoopi is dead on,"" Doherty said, adding that the talk show host’s comparison between the 1950s Hollywood blacklist and the tweets from Messing and McCormack seems apt. ""There is an unpleasant parallel,"" he said. ""In both cases, people are being targeted — and threatened with career consequences — for an unpopular political belief."" Trump weighed in on Messing’s tweet twice on Twitter, writing that the actress is ""in hot water"" and ""being accused of McCarthyism"" before suggesting that she should be fired.  Bad “actress” Debra The Mess Messing is in hot water. She wants to create a “Blacklist” of Trump supporters, & is being accused of McCarthyism. Is also being accused of being a Racist because of the terrible things she said about blacks and mental illness. If Roseanne Barr.... Goldberg said, ""The last time people (created a Hollywood blacklist), people ended up killing themselves … They were accused, and they lost their right to work."" Experts on the original Hollywood blacklist said Goldberg’s account, while lacking specific details, was accurate.

The facts behind Joe Biden’s blended story of battlefield heroism
","  Former Vice President Joe Biden has been taken to task for blending the stories of several soldiers into a single compelling narrative. In August, the Washington Post uncovered discrepancies and inaccuracies in tales of military heroism Biden has told in several speeches since 2016. The most recent came at an August campaign stop in Hanover, N.H., that focused on health care. At the event, Biden highlighted the needs of veterans, especially those with post traumatic stress disorder.  The Biden campaign told PolitiFact that they had no objection to the facts of the events reported by the Post, though they said the article leaves out or downplays what they consider relevant context. Biden told the NPR Politics podcast on Sept. 3 that his mix-up of the details ""has nothing to do with judgment of whether or not you send troops to war, the judgment of whether you bring someone home, the judgment of whether you decide on a health care policy."" ""The details are irrelevant in terms of decision-making,"" Biden told NPR. At PolitiFact, details do matter. Here are the facts of the underlying battlefield events, and how Biden strayed from them. At the Hanover event, Biden spoke of the need to overcome the military ethos of keeping personal pain inside. Soldiers, he said, need to know they can and should seek help. ""I’ve been in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan 30 times. I’ve pinned medals, Silver Stars, on soldiers up in the Upper Konar Valley, in the middle of a firestorm, the poor guys have gone through. Young Navy captain — Navy, Navy — up in the mountains in the Konar Valley of Afghanistan. They’re behind, it’s called a FOB, a forward operating base, behind these great big barriers on top of a mountain in a little cove in a Godforsaken country.  ""One of his buddies got shot. Fell down a ravine about 60 feet. A four-star general asked me, would I go up into the FOB. Everybody got concerned. A vice president going up in the middle of this. But we can lose a vice president. We can’t lose many more of these kids. Not a joke. ""This guy climbed down a ravine. Carried this guy up on his back under fire. And the general wanted me to pin the Silver Star on him.  ""I got up there. And standing —  it’s the God’s truth, my word as a Biden — he stood at attention. I went to pin him, he said, ‘Sir, I don’t want the damn thing. Do not pin it on me, sir. Please. Sir. Do not do that. He died. He died.’ ""Same way in the middle of Fallujah. These kids are amazing."" Biden might have cast this as ""God’s truth,"" but it wasn’t. His story in Hanover melded aspects of three real events into one hybrid narrative. Then-Vice President Joe Biden pins the Bronze Star Medal for Valor on U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Chad Workman during Biden’s visit to Forward Operating Base Airborne in Afghanistan, on Jan. 11, 2011. (U.S. Army) The emotional core of Biden’s story is the soldier telling him he did not want the medal. The closest match is the story of a Bronze Star Biden pinned on U.S. Army Staff Sgt. Chad Workman in 2011 in Wardak Province, Afghanistan. The ceremony took place at Forward Operating Base Airborne in eastern Afghanistan. Workman did not retrieve a wounded soldier from a ravine. Rather, he tried to rescue a friend from a burning Humvee, but he arrived too late. ""I never pulled him out because he was melting,"" Workman told the Post. He confirmed to the newspaper that he did not look forward to the ceremony with Biden: ""I tried to get out of going,"" Workman said. ""I didn’t want that medal."" In recounting the episode in a National Geographic 2016 interview, Biden gave this version of what Workman said right before receiving the medal: ""Sir, I don’t want it. I don’t want it. He died. He died. I didn’t do my job, sir. He died."" Biden campaign spokesman Andrew Bates said this is the essential truth of Biden’s story. ""In Afghanistan, he was moved by Staff Sgt. Workman's valor and selflessness, which is emblematic of the duty and sacrifice of the 9/11 generation of veterans who have given so much across countless deployments,"" Bates said. PolitiFact’s attempt to reach Workman through military press officials was unsuccessful. The Biden campaign said they had no differences with what Workman told the Post. While visiting Afghanistan in 2008 with other senators, Biden witnessed an award ceremony in Konar Province.  Then-Sens. Joe Biden, John Kerry, and Chuck Hagel photographed on a trip to  Afghanistan on Feb. 20, 2008. (State Department) In 2007, during a firefight with the Taliban, a bullet cut through the jaw and neck of a soldier manning a hilltop machine gun. Under fire, Army Pfc. Miles Foltz got to his friend, pulled him to safety, stopped the bleeding and saved his life. During Biden’s trip, he watched as Maj. Gen. David Rodriguez pinned the Bronze Star on Foltz. In 2014, President Barack Obama awarded the Medal of Honor, the nation’s highest military recognition, to Army Sgt. Kyle White. Biden was not present at the ceremony. In 2007, White and 13 other members of his squad and an Afghan unit were making their way up a hill alongside a cliff when they were caught in an ambush. ""The platoon returned fire,"" Obama said in the White House award ceremony. ""Kyle quickly emptied a full magazine, but as he went to load a second, an enemy grenade exploded and knocked him unconscious.  He came to with his face pressed against a rock."" Former Army Sgt. Kyle Jerome White receives the Medal of Honor from President Barack Obama on May 13, 2014. (U.S. Army) Several of the other soldiers slid down the cliff to safety, but White saw Spc. Kain Schilling burrowed down behind a small tree, trying to treat a shattered arm. ""Kyle sprinted through enemy fire to Kain’s side and began applying a tourniquet — shielding Kain with his own body as gunfire shredded that tree,"" Obama said. White aided a second wounded soldier on that hillside and, with bullets whizzing past, pulled him to shelter. That soldier didn’t survive, but the first one did. After the ceremony, White showed reporters a metal bracelet on his wrist. ""It was given to me by another survivor of the 9 November ambush. He wears an identical one,"" White said. ""This has made it even more precious than the medal of symbol just placed around my neck. On it are the names of six fallen brothers; they are my heroes."" Then-Vice President Joe Biden at a restored flag presentation in Melbourne, Australia, on July 17, 2016. (Pool via AP) Biden has told similar stories in the past, but with variations. For instance, during a visit to Australia as vice president on July 17, 2016, Biden recalled pinning a Silver Star on a Navy captain at a ""forward operating base up in the valley.""  The captain, Biden said, was ""a kid who jumped off the edge of a mountain where this FOB was, with only six people defending it, climbed down about 200 feet, put a kid on his back who had been wounded, carried him back up under gunfire, but 10 hours later, he died."" When Biden went to pin the medal on the captain, Biden recalled, ""He said, sir, with all due respect, sir, I do not want it."" This version wraps together elements of Foltz’s story (Biden was present at his pinning), White’s story (heroism alongside a cliff), and Workman’s story (the wish not to receive the medal). This version also garbles a few elements (it was a Bronze Star, not a Silver Star. Then-Vice President Joe Biden joined Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander at a campaign rally in St. Louis, Missouri. (C-SPAN screenshot) Later that year, while stumping for U.S. Senate candidate Jason Kander, Biden told yet another version. He referenced both the cliffside heroism and the burning Humvee, suggesting that both medal recipients tried to refuse the medal, saying they didn’t deserve it.  ""This is the God’s truth,"" Biden said at one point in his retelling. Biden said that as vice president, he pinned a Silver Star on a Navy Captain in Afghanistan. Biden said the soldier pulled a mortally wounded comrade out of a ravine, and later resisted receiving a medal. Biden did pin a medal on a soldier who felt he didn’t deserve a medal, and it was in Afghanistan. From there, several details are wrong: The soldier tried to rescue a comrade from a burning Humvee, not off the slope of a ravine. He was an Army specialist, not a Navy captain. Biden was a senator, not vice president. The medal was a Bronze Star, not a Silver Star. The emotional element of a soldier who feels his medal is unwarranted is accurate. But Biden embellished the tale with details to give the story an unimpeachable ring of truth, and the facts don’t back that up.

Trump correct about natural gas trends in New York and Pennsylvania
","President Donald Trump kept up his criticism of New York during a recent speech in Pennsylvania about energy and manufacturing.   ""From 2010 to 2017, natural gas production plummeted by nearly 70 percent in New York, but it soared almost 1,000 percent in Pennsylvania,"" Trump said at the Shell Pennsylvania Petrochemicals Complex. ""And New York won't allow us to build a pipeline across because New York is sort of a long state and we can't have pipelines going across, helping a region that's not a wealthy region at all."" Trump has criticized New York and its elected leadership many times in the past, and we wondered if his latest claim about natural gas production in New York and Pennsylvania was accurate. We turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, part of the U.S. Department of Energy, for statistics about natural gas production in New York and Pennsylvania. The administration collects, analyzes and publishes ""independent and impartial energy information,"" according to its website.  In New York, natural gas production totaled 35.8 billion cubic feet in 2010 and 11.4 billion cubic feet in 2017. That’s a 68 percent decrease. In Pennsylvania, production in 2010 totaled 572.9 billion cubic feet. By 2017, production totaled 5.5 trillion cubic feet, according to the administration. That’s an increase of 854 percent, when unrounded numbers are used. In addition to researching the federal energy data repository, we researched natural gas production data in each state, and found similar results.    The New York State Department of Environmental Conservation provided similar statistics for 2010 and 2017, and it calculated that production fell by 66 percent.  In Pennsylvania, the dramatic increase in natural gas production can be attributed to ""unconventional"" wells, or wells that are drilled deep into shale formations through a process known as hydraulic fracturing, or fracking. Natural gas drilling in the Marcellus Shale region in Pennsylvania began in 2004, according to the state. The Marcellus Shale, which generally lies under parts of Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, and West Virginia, is currently the ""most prolific natural gas area in the United States,"" according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  In 2017, Pennsylvania recorded 5.36 trillion cubic feet of natural gas was produced from unconventional wells, which at the time was the largest natural gas production figure on record, according to the state’s Department of Environmental Protection.  Natural gas production from these unconventional wells grew by 1,360 percent between 2010 and 2017, according to  Elizabeth Rementer, the Department of Environmental Protection press secretary. Rementer also confirmed that the calculation of an increase in 854 percent of total natural gas production between 2010 and 2017, taken from federally collected data, is accurate.  The dramatically different trends in natural gas production in each state can be tied to their different response to hydraulic fracturing. While Pennsylvania has seen significant growth in this kind of production, making it the second-largest producer in the country, behind Texas, New York, citing health risks associated with the practice, banned this kind of natural gas extraction in 2014.  While New York has ""one of the most energy-efficient economies in the nation,"" it relies on other states, including Pennsylvania, and Canada, for most of its natural gas needs, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.  Trump also referenced a pipeline across New York state. He could have been referring to a decision New York regulators made in May to deny a new natural gas pipeline, citing concerns about water quality. The pipeline would have connected natural gas fields in Pennsylvania with New Jersey and New York. Press officers at the White House did not respond to our request for information.  President Trump said between 2010 and 2017, natural gas production in New York fell by nearly 70 percent, while production in Pennsylvania grew by nearly 1,000 percent.   In Pennsylvania, total natural gas production grew by 854 percent between 2010 and 2017. In New York, total natural gas production fell by between 66 and 68 percent.  Trump’s statement was mostly accurate, but there’s enough difference between 854 percent and nearly 1,000 percent to warrant a Mostly True ruling.",/factchecks/2019/sep/04/donald-trump/trump-correct-about-natural-gas-trends-new-york-an/

Obama says he will cut deficits by $4 trillion
","
In the first presidential debate, President Obama and Mitt Romney disagreed sharply over who had the best way to rein in federal deficits.

Romney relies on spending cuts and reshaping the tax code. The first would make it easier to reach fiscal balance and the second would spur growth that would fill the government coffers with higher tax revenues, he says.

Obama favors what he calls a balanced approach. It uses a mix of spending cuts and a variety of tax and fee increases to curb the deficit .

""I've put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan, Obama said. ""You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise. And the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue.""

Is Obama’s $4 trillion claim accurate? Sort of -- but $1.7 trillion dollars of it depends on when you start counting the savings.

We rely on two Washington think tanks for this fact-check. The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization that is very keen on debt reduction, crunches the numbers in the President’s 2013 budget and finds that by 2022, Obama’s program trims the deficit by $2.4 trillion. That’s compared to what the committee thinks the fiscal picture would have looked like without the president’s plan.

The other think tank is the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group. It comes up with pretty much the same result. It sees $2.1 trillion in deficit trimming that would accumulate between 2013 and 2022.

Neither of these reach the $4 trillion mark. But last year, between a series of continuing resolutions that froze department budgets and a major deficit reduction compromise between President Obama and Congress, the government racked up $1.7 trillion in savings.

If you add that to either of the think tank numbers, you get close to or over the $4 trillion the president counts in his plan. Whether that’s legitimate is a matter of debate.

Our fact-checking colleagues at the Washington Post say, ""No matter who is the president, the savings are already in the bank."" Thus, don’t count them.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities argues that since the effort to trim the deficit began in earnest in 2011, that those savings should be counted toward the goal.

Here, it’s useful to see where the $4 trillion goal came from. Its origins lie in the Simpson-Bowles National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform. That bipartisan panel said a blend of spending cuts and tax hikes could deliver nearly $4 trillion in deficit reductions by 2020.

The president adopts that general approach on the fiscal side, but note the difference in the timelines. With all these plans, the biggest savings come at the end and the president is working with two more years than the Simpson-Bowles group. The difference is huge.

Jason Peuquet, research director for the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, said if you add two years to the Simpson-Bowles approach, you reach deficit reductions in the range of $6 trillion starting from the same point that the president begins his tally. Obama cites the Simpson-Bowles report to justify his balanced approach of spending cuts and tax increases. However, that report taken as whole would push the president to do much more than he has proposed

""The president’s plan is a good start but does not go far enough,"" said Pequet.

Our ruling

President Obama said he had ""put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan.""

According to independent analysts, that’s true only if you include the spending cuts that took place last year. It is not necessary to resolve that debate to assess the president’s claim. Obama cherry-picks the elements from the commission report that gave rise to the $4 trillion goal.

Mitt Romney says up to 20 million will lose health insurance due to Obama health care law
","
During the first presidential debate in Denver, Mitt Romney criticized President Barack Obama’s health care law by saying, ""Right now, the (Congressional Budget Office) says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.""

While PolitiFact does not put predictions to the Truth-O-Meter, we do fact-check whether politicians or pundits accurately portray the predictions made by others.

We did so in June, when Romney made a similar claim in a speech -- that ""Obamacare … means that for up to 20 million Americans, they will lose the insurance they currently have, the insurance that they like and they want to keep."" We rated that claim False.

We’ll take another look at the claim here.
   
Cherry-picking the CBO report

When we checked with the Romney campaign last June, a spokesman said the source of Romney’s claim was a March 2012 study by the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number-crunching arm of Congress. The Romney campaign re-confirmed that source after the debate.
   
The CBO study was undertaken to estimate the impact of the health care law on the number of people obtaining health care coverage from their employer. CBO came up with a ""baseline"" estimate -- its best guess. CBO settled on a range of 3 million to 5 million fewer non-elderly people obtaining coverage through their employer each year from 2019 through 2022 than would have been the case before the law was passed. Including those with individually purchased policies means a decline of an additional 1 million to 3 million Americans.
   
That’s nothing to sneeze at, but it’s quite a bit lower than 20 million. So where did 20 million come from?
       
CBO supplemented its ""baseline"" estimate with four alternative, and wildly divergent, estimates. One resulted in a net gain of 3 million people with employer-sponsored insurance. The other scenarios resulted in a decline of 10 million, a decline of 12 million, and -- here it is -- a decline of 20 million.
       
A number of other estimates by groups other than CBO have tracked with CBO’s baseline estimate, rather than with Romney’s figure. A study by the Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people. The Lewin Group predicted a decline of about 3 million people. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary pegged the number at about 1 million fewer people. And the RAND Corp. projected that about 4 million more individuals would be covered by employment-based coverage by 2016.
   
So the 20 million number Romney cited does come from CBO, and he hedged by saying ""up to."" But it’s the most extreme outcome of the five presented, and it’s not the primary estimate.
       
Some who ""lose"" coverage will do so because they find better options
       
Even beyond the cherry-picking, Romney is wrong to say that 20 million Americans will ""lose"" their insurance.
   
According to CBO’s ""baseline"" estimates, 3 million people will spurn their employer’s offer of insurance and turn instead to another source, such as the health insurance ""exchanges"" created under the Obama health care law. In many cases, they will do this because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking too many features they need.
   
Romney also ignores 9 million people who wouldn’t have had an employer plan before the Obama law, but who will get employer coverage after passage of the law, perhaps because of the law’s mix of subsidies and penalties for employers.
   
It’s also important to remember the big picture. CBO projects that, overall, the number of uninsured Americans will drop by 29 million to 31 million due to the law.

It’s not as if no one ever loses coverage today
   
As we have previously noted, many Americans lose their current health plan for reasons that have nothing to do with the new law, though figuring out exactly how many is surprisingly tricky.
   
Bureau of Labor Statistics figures show that, on average, slightly more than 3 percent of employees leave their jobs in any given month. But you don’t have to change jobs to see your plan change. Your employer may change insurance carriers, or the insurance carrier may unilaterally modify the terms of your plan.
       
How common is this? The Medical Expenditure Panel Survey, sponsored by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, found that in 2007, just over 14 percent of the entire U.S. population ""switched"" health insurance.
   
All told, this churn -- which, to reiterate, is happening because of forces beyond the Obama health care law -- almost certainly dwarfs the scale of the changes Romney is talking about.
   
Even Romney’s cherry-picked number of 20 million amounts to 7 percent of the 270 million non-elderly people in the U.S. CBO’s preferred figure represents an even smaller share -- 1 percent to 2 percent.
   
Our ruling
   
Romney said, ""Right now, the (Congressional Budget Office) says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year.""

That number is cherry-picked, and many of those 20 million will be leaving employer coverage voluntarily for better options. Romney also ignores that under the status quo, many more people today ""lose"" coverage than even the highest, cherry-picked CBO estimate. We rate his statement False.",/factchecks/2012/oct/04/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-20-million-will-lose-health-insur/
"['New Jersey', 'Debt', 'Deficit', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims Barack Obama has not outlined plan to reduce federal deficit by $4 trillion
","For the news media citing a lack of detail in Mitt Romney’s proposals, Gov. Chris Christie offers these instructions: be fair to the Republican presidential nominee and get tough on President Barack Obama for not providing the specifics behind his own promises.

During an interview Sunday on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" host David Gregory noted how Romney has failed to enumerate which tax deductions he would eliminate, and asked Christie whether Romney would provide those details during Wednesday’s debate.

The New Jersey governor argued that the media should be ""just as tough on the president"" for failing to explain how he would reduce the federal deficit by $4 trillion.

""He says he’s going to reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn’t say how he’s going to do it,"" Christie, a Republican, told Gregory. ""I mean, you know, let’s be fair here.""

The governor repeated that claim later in the interview, saying Obama ""puts out a nice two-minute ad that says he’s going to reduce the debt by four trillion, but never tells us how.""

OK, governor, let’s be fair: you’re wrong to claim Obama has not outlined his deficit reduction plan.

In an 80-page report issued in September 2011 and again in the president’s budget proposal released in February, the Obama administration has laid out detailed proposals and dollar amounts for how to achieve more than $4 trillion in savings over the next decade.

The governor’s office did not respond to two e-mails seeking comment.

Let’s explain some of those details.

Obama’s deficit reduction plan relies on a mix of tax reductions for some, tax hikes for others and spending cuts.

A large part of the savings would come from roughly $1.5 trillion worth of tax reform measures. For instance, the plan would allow federal income tax cuts to expire for upper-income taxpayers, while extending them for other Americans.

The president’s plan also would reduce certain tax deductions for upper-income taxpayers and close various tax loopholes, such as by ending tax breaks for oil and gas companies.

In many cases, the reform proposals are so specific that only tax policy wonks may really understand them.

Another roughly $850 billion in savings would come from winding down the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, according to the president’s budget. In addition, the deficit reduction plan accounts for roughly $1 trillion in spending cuts built into legislation signed by the president last year.

The Obama administration also has provided specific proposals for more than $500 billion in spending cuts and reforms to mandatory programs.

Those provisions include changes to Medicare and Medicaid; a reduction in certain agricultural subsidies; and a series of reforms within the U.S. Postal Service, such as reducing mail delivery from six days to five days per week.

However, the president’s plan has received both praise and criticism.

""Such a balanced approach -- both increases in revenues and reductions in spending -- is the only approach that will put the budget on an economically and politically sustainable path,"" wrote James R. Horney, vice president of Federal Fiscal Policy for the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank.

But Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan organization focused on debt reduction, said in a news release that ""the use of this war gimmick is quite troubling.

""Drawing down spending on wars that were already set to wind down and that were deficit financed in the first place should not be considered savings,"" she said.

Our ruling

In an interview on NBC’s ""Meet the Press,"" Christie claimed Obama ""says he’s gonna reduce the long-term debt and deficit by $4 trillion, doesn’t say how he's gonna do it.""

But the president has outlined in extensive detail how he would achieve more than $4 trillion in deficit reduction over the next decade. That plan has received mixed reviews, but it’s ridiculous for Christie to suggest Obama has not provided such specific proposals.

So, governor, here’s a fiery dose of fairness for you: Pants on Fire! https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/d67054db-a2e9-4a49-b5a7-edc9ea760199 To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com.",/factchecks/2012/oct/04/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-barack-obama-has-not-outline/
"['Federal Budget', 'Military', 'Virginia', 'Wayne Powell']","
Wayne Powell says Eric Cantor voted to protect his pay and against guaranteeing pay to troops
","
Wayne Powell, the Democratic challenger for the 7th Congressional District, portrayed incumbent Eric Cantor as serving his own interests during an Oct. 1 debate.

Cantor, a Republican, is the majority leader of the House of Representatives. Powell held Cantor responsible for fueling a budget impasse with Democrats in April 2011 that came within a day of shutting down the government.

Powell was emotional when his chance came to ask Cantor a prepared question. ""This is for my son,"" he said. Powell’s son is an Army major who has served in Afghanistan.

Then he turned to Cantor.

""Last year when you and the president were in a budget standoff that threatened to shut down the federal government, you voted to continue paying members of Congress, including yourself, in the event of a shutdown,"" Powell told the majority leader. ""At the same time, you voted against a bill which would have -- it would ensure -- that members of the armed services continue to get paid.

""My question is this, Eric: How could you in good conscience vote to continue your own pay but, at the same vote to stop paying our servicemen and women that you voted to send into combat in Afghanistan?""

We decided to check Powell’s facts, which Cantor said were wrong. 
Powell’s campaign backed the claim by pointing us to two procedural votes held during heated debates on spending. We’ll take a look at each.

Military pay

On April 7, 2011, President Barack Obama and Republican leaders were in tense budget negotiations one day before a government shutdown deadline. The GOP was demanding billions in spending cuts in return for passing an appropriations bill. Obama vowed to veto any legislation that contained what he said were harsh GOP demands for cuts in social programs and an end to federal funding for Planned Parenthood.

The Republican-led House sought to ease the pressure that day by proposing a one-week appropriations bill. The legislation would have funded the Department of Defense for a longer time -- through the end of the fiscal year on Sept. 30. Republicans called the measure a ""troop funding bill.""

Democrats were not to be outdone. During floor debate, they said there was no guarantee Obama would sign the measure. Rep. Bill Owens, D-N.Y., offered an amendment that would ensure troops would continue to be paid if the government closed. Owens never explained how he expected to protect military pay by offering an amendment to a bill he said was likely to be vetoed.

Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., denounced the motion as ""purely a political gesture."" Rogers said the GOP bill, which he sponsored, already provided ""the essential funds for our men and women who are in harm’s way.""

Cantor voted against Owens’ motion, along with all but one Republican. But he was in the 247-181 majority, including 15 Democrats, who voted for the underlying bill.

So did Cantor really vote against a bill that would have ensured troops get paid, as Powell said?

No.

Congressional pay

On April 1, 2011, House Republicans passed a bill directing that its version of budget become law if the Senate did not act on it by April 6. This appeared to violate the U.S. Constitution, which says that both chambers must approve bills before they can become law.

The measure included a provision that would deny pay to members of Congress and the president if a shutdown occurred. This was major public relations point because members of Congress get paid during a shutdown, while most other federal employees do not.  

Some Republicans pointed out that, under the constitution, congressional pay cannot be reduced in the middle of a term. To allay concerns, other Republicans suggested they could be paid retroactively when the shutdown ended, like the rest of the federal workforce.

Democrats upped the stakes, seeking an amendment that would bar retro payments to Congress. Then they got a surprise. Rep. Dan Lungren, R-Calif., revealed an email he had received from Obama’s Department of Justice questioning the constitutionality of the Democrats’ motion.

The amendment was defeated on a partisan 236-187 vote. Cantor and all but one Republican voted against it.

Cantor then voted for the underlying bill, which included the problematic ban on paying Congress during a shutdown. It passed the House but died in the Senate.

Both measures -- as dubious as they were -- were attempts to erase the pay protection for congress members in the event of a government shutdown. So to say Cantor was out to protect his paycheck is a big stretch.

A final note

The Democratic amendments at issue were ""motions to recommit,"" a prerogative of the minority party since the 1st Congress. They are motions, often procedural, to send a bill back to a committee just before a floor vote on passage of the legislation is held. Both parties, when in the minority, have these motions to ""make political statements and try to embarrass the majority for partisan advantage,"" according to David Wolfensberger, an expert on parliamentary rules and former Republican staffer on the House Rules Committee.

Our ruling

Powell said that Cantor, during the threat of a government shutdown last year, voted to ensure Congress would continue to be paid and against offering the same protection to members of the military.

But Powell got it backwards. Cantor, during a period of high political gamesmanship, supported Republican legislation that, in the event of shutdown, would have continued military pay and withheld paychecks for Congress members. He simply opposed two procedural efforts by Democrats that would have given them some bragging rights.

Powell’s charge was not off-the-cuff. It came during a portion of a debate when he got to ask Cantor a direct question. Powell, in comments leading up to his query, said he’d given plenty of thought to what he’d ask. That suggests he had time to check all the facts.  

Powell should take heat for ridiculously distorting Cantor’s votes. So we give his statement our lowest rating -- Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2012/oct/04/wayne-powell/wayne-powell-says-eric-cantor-voted-protect-his-pa/

Lee Leffingwell says voters can approve bond propositions without raising taxes
","
Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell floated a pocketbook reason to support bond proposals placed on the November 2012 ballot by the Austin City Council.

""These seven bond proposals offer Austinites an important opportunity to invest in our community’s future without raising taxes,"" Leffingwell said in an Aug. 31, 2012, press release from a group backing the bonds.

Leffingwell, who chairs the Unity PAC urging voter support of the bond propositions, aired his reference to taxes less than two weeks before he voted, alone among council members, against approval of the city’s new $3.1 billion budget.

At the body’s Sept. 11, 2012, meeting, Leffingwell said the council had failed to try hard enough to scale back a planned property tax increase. Under the budget, which took effect Oct. 1, the property tax rate grows from 48.11 cents per $100 of property value to 50.29 cents. That means a city tax bill of $897 for the owners of a median-value Austin home of $178,327, a $20 increase over the previous year.

So, would approval of the $385 million in proposed bonds not raise taxes?

The proposed bonds reflect what remains from an original wish list of $1.3 billion in possible bond-backed projects, the Austin American-Statesman has reported. The balloted bonds would pay to renovate libraries, improve parks, repair roads and build or repair low-income housing. They amount to Austin's first full-scale bond package since 2006.

By email, Unity PAC spokesman Mark Nathan said Leffingwell’s no-tax-increase claim stems from a December 2011 analysis presented by city staffers to the council showing that some $385 million in general-obligation bonds could be issued without requiring an increase in the city’s existing debt service property tax rate, meaning the rate needed to generate enough revenue to pay the bonds’ principal and interest costs.

Indeed, a chart in the presentation indicates that the issuance of $385 million in bonds would keep the debt tax rate steady. The chart indicates that issuing up to $725 million in bonds would require up to a 3-cent increase in the debt rate.

However, another chart in the presentation indicates that if $385 million in bonds were issued, the average homeowner would still pay $38 more in city taxes as of 2016. The chart says that would be the increase in city taxes on a $200,000 home, taking into account modest expected increases in assessed values.

By email, Nathan told us there is no certainty property valuations will go up, so it’s possible taxpayers would not pay more in taxes due to valuations.

The Statesman’s Dec. 17, 2011, news article drawing on the presentation quotes Greg Canally, a city finance officer, explaining that the debt tax rate could be kept steady despite the issuance of $385 million in fresh bonds because the city is continually retiring previously issued debt. Overall, the story says, the city's tax rate at the time was 48.11 cents per $100 valuation, including the 12.6 cents to pay debt on previously approved bonds. 
Of late, the debt tax rate is 12 cents, an adjustment driven by an uptick in home valuations, the city says. In his email, Nathan reminded that council members only hold sway over the city’s tax rates. Property valuations are overseen by the Travis Central Appraisal District.

""That's why, in my experience, it's almost always the vernacular of elected officials, and very frequently of the media as well, to mean ‘tax rates’ when speaking of ‘taxes,’"" Nathan wrote.

Nathan noted the Statesman’s Aug. 15, 2012, news article on the council giving preliminary approval to putting the bond issues on the ballot, which included: ""The council wants a bond package no larger than $385 million because that number will not require a property tax increase.""

The story also brings up the possible tax impact of the bond proposals not happening: ""If the bond package isn't placed on the ballot or doesn't pass, the debt portion of the city's tax rate would probably stay roughly the same over the next few years, then could go down in 2015, 2016 and 2017, city budget staffers said. They have no estimate of what the decrease would be.""

In a telephone interview, Canally told us that if none of the bond propositions pass, the debt tax rate would drop about two cents over about five years starting in 2015, ""all other things being equal."" On a $200,000 house, the resulting city-tied tax reduction would be about $40, he said.

A key factor would be changes in home valuations. If valuations surge, there would be less pressure on tax rates, while if valuations drop, there would be pressure to raise rates. Canally said that since the early 2000s, the city’s debt tax rate has dropped from about 21 cents per $100 valuation as a result of increases in home valuations.

By email, Nathan agreed the debt tax rate would drop two cents should the bond propositions fail, presuming the city issues outstanding bonds previously approved by voters as planned; city assumptions about assessed valuations hold true; and voters authorize and the city issues no additional general-obligation debt.

Our ruling

Leffingwell said the bond propositions offer an opportunity to invest ""without raising taxes.""

No tax-rate increase would be required. But this statement overlooks the fact that taxes paid by homeowners and others would still be going up a bit, presuming expected increases in property valuations. Also unsaid: The debt rate would decrease two cents as of 2015 if the propositions fail to pass.

Sherrod Brown ad claims Josh Mandel raised campaign cash instead of showing up for work
","
Although he didn’t formally announce his candidacy until early this year, within months of taking office as Ohio treasurer in 2011, it was apparent that Republican Josh Mandel was running for the U.S. Senate.

An ad from the campaign of his opponent, incumbent Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, targets his performance in Columbus, making this claim:

""While Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work.""

That made him sound like a no-show employee, which drew the interest of PolitiFact Ohio.

We asked the Brown campaign to back up the claim. It cited an Associated Press story from Jan. 26, 2012, that reported Mandel was in Washington that day ""to attend a $500-a-plate breakfast fundraiser for his U.S. Senate campaign, continuing his trend of skipping meetings of a board he chairs that handles billions of Ohio's deposits.""

That is the State Board of Deposit, which decides which banks get custody of the state's money. Chaired by the treasurer, the panel also includes the auditor and attorney general. It meets monthly.

The board's minutes show Mandel missed 14 consecutive meetings after taking office before attending his first one on March 19. He was quoted at the time as saying that it was the first meeting in two years involving a major decision about state deposits.

Mandel's office noted he is permitted by statute to send a representative in his place when he misses the meetings. Board records show that he sent his chief financial officer and general counsel, Seth Metcalf.

Both Auditor Dave Yost and Attorney General Mike DeWine also have sent surrogates, the records show. Like Mandel, the meeting March 19 was the first either of them attended personally.

Though sending a designee to meetings is not uncommon, the Associated Press found Mandel ""unique among modern-era treasurers"" by attending none in his first year.

An AP report from Jan. 25, 2012, said that ""Democrat Kevin Boyce and Republican Jennette Bradley both attended the board’s monthly meetings less than half the time. Democrat Richard Cordray almost always went. Earlier treasurers Ken Blackwell, Joe Deters and Mary Ellen Withrow all attended at least occasionally.""

The online magazine Salon published a story on Oct. 3, 2012 -- after the Brown ad was broadcast -- noting that the state treasurer also serves on an additional seven boards or commissions. Mandel sent representatives but did not attend any of their meetings until last March, Salon said, citing information it was provided by the liberal research group American Bridge through open records requests.

Mandel's spokesman Seth Unger, who called the report a ""red herring,"" said the treasurer ""has appointed designees to represent him on these boards, commissions and authorities, as has been customary under prior administrations both Democrat and Republican alike.

""Our designees have also confirmed that the other statewide officers currently on these boards send designees to represent their offices,"" he said. ""It should be noted that while these bodies remain in statute, some meet only very sporadically, and one has not convened for years.""

The Brown campaign also provided a list of 225 out-of-office events which could be viewed as political, from late March 2011 to early July 2012 -- 44 of them out-of-state, with all but three of those on workdays, and including at least 64 fundraisers.

Democrats have pointed to Mandel's calendar before, as an article in The Plain Dealer reported last January, to argue he was barely working or that he was not being forthcoming in how he spends his time.

While the events show Mandel's political involvement, however, they do not provide evidence that he failed to perform his duties of office, as spelled out in Chapter 113 of the Ohio Revised Code.

The treasurer of state is an elected administrator. He does not have specified hours or attendance requirements. It’s not like his office shuts down when he is not there. The treasurer has a staff that handles the daily operations of the office.

When the Ohio Democratic Party made a public records request for Mandel's official schedule, the treasurer's officer delivered with it a copy of Mandel's ""2011 Top-Bottom Review,"" listing what he considered his office's top accomplishments.

The treasurer's Annual Report for fiscal 2012 listed more of what his office called steps ""to cut waste, reduce spending and increase efficiency."" The week of Sept. 28, 2012, the office touted the launch of a searchable online database of Ohio's state-owned properties and buildings.

What does all this say about the claim in Brown's TV ad, that ""while Mandel's been busy traveling the country raising campaign money, he hasn't shown up for work""?

The claim in the Brown ad is partially accurate. His campaign cited meetings of the Board of Deposit, on which Mandel sits, including at least one case where Mandel was fundraising in Washington on the day of a meeting. It also cited at least 44 out-of-state political events from March 2011 to July 2012 from Mandel’s schedule -- slightly less than three per month -- and more than 200 out-of-office events, of which at least 64 were fundraisers.

But the ad leaves out important details needed to put the claim in context.

Members of the Board of Deposit are permitted to send a representative in their place. Mandel has done that, as did both the auditor and attorney general, who also are on the board.

In assessing a claim about the state investment pool’s credit rating, PolitiFact Ohio talked to a financial expert from Standard & Poors who noted that Mandel deserved credit for his performance as state treasurer, an administrative post whose responsibilities by law are to safeguard and invest the state’s money. During the time he has been state treasurer, the state’s credit rating for it’s STAR Ohio investment fund has remained at the top level.

It is not uncommon for politicians to run for higher office while holding an elected seat, and the that can have an impact on the amount of time they are in their current jobs.

But the implication of the claim in the Brown campaign ad is that Mandel has neglected his duties as state treasurer while he campaigns for Senate. While there is support for the claim that he has been out of the office, we don’t see evidence that the office is not functioning properly.

Obama says Romney's plan is a $5 trillion tax cut
","
Early in the first presidential debate, President Barack Obama attacked Mitt Romney’s tax plan as unbalanced and devastating for the middle class. He charged that Romney’s plan ""calls for a $5 trillion tax cut,"" and challenged him to defend it.

The candidates repeatedly disagreed about that number. Four times the president spoke of Romney’s $5 trillion tax cut, and four times the governor rejected it.

Obama said: ""Governor Romney's proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he's been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn't been able to identify them.""

Later, Romney countered: ""I'm not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I've said is I won't put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That's part one. So there's no economist that can say Mitt Romney's tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.""

Obama has talked about the $5 trillion tax cut for months. We have looked at this claim before and found it lacked important context. Here’s why.

The claim is based on a study done by the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan group that has analyzed the tax plans of the candidates. The center examined Romney’s proposals for a 20 percent reduction in all federal income tax rates, eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax, eliminating the estate tax and other tax reductions.

The center estimated that altogether, the lost revenues would total $480 billion by 2015. The Obama campaign adds up the cost over a decade and winds up with $4.8 trillion, which it then rounds up to $5 trillion.

The conclusion is accurate but misleading. Yes, the cuts would total that amount, but as Obama himself noted as he continued speaking, Romney hopes to offset the lost revenues by closing loopholes and deductions. The reductions in tax breaks are as much a part of Romney’s plan as the tax cuts.

But Obama is right in pointing out that Romney has yet to specify what tax breaks he would change. The most Romney has personally said is that he might cap deductions at $17,000, but that is a broad figure and does not describe how the number would be achieved.

The impact of changing deductions on the scale needed to offset the tax cuts would be great. The largest deductions include interest on home mortgages, state and local taxes and the tax free treatment of health benefits. These are real pocketbook issues for most households and tinkering with them could have significant effects on large sectors of the economy.

Romney offers key details on the taxes he would cut. But in explaining how to pay for them, he has essentially said only that he would keep the overall tax burden the same across all income groups by changing unnamed tax breaks.

Our ruling

President Obama said Mitt Romney seeks a $5 trillion tax cut.

The $5 trillion figure accounts for only half of Romney’s plan -- and it's cumulative over 10 years. The governor says he will offset those lost revenues by reducing tax deductions and eliminating loopholes. However, he has never said what those changes would be.

The president made a misleading statement about an incomplete plan, but he did describe what the plan was missing and Romney would not fill in the gaps.

President Barack Obama’s health care law includes a mighty powerful board that will dictate treatment decisions for Medicare patients, said Mitt Romney at the Oct. 3 debate in Denver.

When explaining why he opposed the health care law, Romney said Barack Obama ""put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.""

He also said this: ""And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have."" And later: ""In order to bring the cost of health care down, we don't need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have.""

Obama refuted Romney’s remark, saying, ""Let me just point out first of all this board that we're talking about can't make decisions about what treatments are given.""

For this fact-check, we will focus on Romney’s statement about whether the unelected board -- formally called the Independent Payments Advisory board, or IPAB for short -- can tell people what kind of treatments they can have.

We’ve previously checked a whole slew of claims about the health care law and the IPAB. Many of the variations of Romney’s claim have been in false territory -- depending on the wording -- including a Pants on Fire for Pat Boone who said the board ""can ration care and deny certain Medicare treatments."" (That was one of our Top 5 falsehoods on the health care law.)

We gave a Mostly False to Paul Ryan who said that the ""unelected, unaccountable"" board created by the health care law ""will lead to denied care for current seniors.""

We will note up front that Romney used somewhat softer words than some other critics of the board in that he didn’t use the words ""ration"" or ""unaccountable.""

IPAB can’t ration care or make decisions for individuals

We will borrow from our previous items to explain the board and Romney’s claim. Some of our information comes from the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonprofit, nonpartisan group that studies health care, which put out a primer in 2010 about the board and a longer paper in 2011.

The health care law directs a new national board — with 15 members who are political appointees — to identify Medicare savings. It's forbidden from submitting ""any recommendation to ration health care,"" as Section 3403 of the health care law states. It may not raise premiums for Medicare beneficiaries or increase deductibles, coinsurance or co-payments. The IPAB also cannot change who is eligible for Medicare, restrict benefits or make recommendations that would raise revenue.

What it can do is reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of re-admissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. Some argue that because the IPAB can reduce the money a doctor receives, this could lead to an indirect form of rationing.

But the board wouldn't make any health care decisions for individual Americans. Instead, as PolitiFact Georgia reported, it would make broad policy decisions that affect Medicare's overall cost.

For this fact-check, a Romney campaign spokesman sent us a 2011 POLITICO article that largely focused on the challenges of filling the spots on the board, which the headline described as ""Medicare cost-cutting job could be worst in D.C."" The article mentioned that Republicans have portrayed it as rationing care, but that the law prohibits the board from rationing health care.

The Romney campaign also cited the New York Times health care blog Prescriptions, which stated in 2010 that the drug industry, hospitals and doctors’ groups want to get rid of the board.

""While the board is not supposed to be able to cut benefits, industry groups fear that its actions would result in rationing care,"" stated the New York Times blog. ""The board, known as IPAB, could cut payments to health care providers.""

Our ruling

When Romney was talking about the Independent Payment Advisory Board and Medicare, he said, Barack Obama ""put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they're going to receive.""

He avoided the more inaccurate and harsher wording of some other critics, who have falsely described the board as ""rationing"" care. But Romney’s claim can leave viewers with the impression that the board will sit around a table and talk about whether grandpa can get his bypass or not, and that’s not the case.

The board can reduce how much the government pays health care providers for services, reduce payments to hospitals with very high rates of re-admissions or recommend innovations that cut wasteful spending. And there are questions about whether that could lead to different treatment decisions, but Romney's comments give a misleading impression.

Mitt Romney says U.S. is 'now spending 42 percent of our economy on government'
","
During the first presidential debate in Denver, Mitt Romney warned that the U.S. risks harming its economy if government spending continues at its current pace.

""Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government,"" Romney said. ""We’re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don’t want to go down the path to Spain.""

We looked into the scale of government in a previous item, which we’ll update here with the most recent figures.

The Office of Management and Budget produces a table every year that tracks total government expenditures as a percentage of gross domestic product. Here are the statistics for the past few fiscal years in question:
       
Fiscal year 2007: 30.9 percent
Fiscal year 2008: 32.6 percent
Fiscal year 2009: 37.1 percent
Fiscal year 2010: 35.4 percent
Fiscal year 2011: 35.4 percent
   
So by this measurement, Romney’s 42 percent figure is a little high.

However, there is another measurement that backs up Romney’s claim. The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development -- a group that includes most of the world’s advanced industrialized countries -- found that government expenditures accounted for 42 percent of the U.S. economy in 2009 (compared to 45.8 percent for Spain).

Since the OMB data showed that government spending as a share of the economy peaked in 2009 before declining, likely because it was the first year of the recession, it seems reasonable to assume that the percentage will drop for subsequent years once the next OECD calculations are released. Still, it’s likely that Romney’s 42 percent figure is pretty close to accurate.

However, using only the big-picture numbers tells only part of the story. Here’s the breakdown of spending for 2011, according to OMB:
   
Federal expenditures for defense and international accounts: 5.0 percent
Federal net interest expenditures: 1.8 percent
Federal Social Security and Medicare expenditures: 8.6 percent
Federal payments to individuals exclusive of Social Security and Medicare: 7.1 percent
Federal spending in all other categories: 1.9 percent
State and local government: 11.0 percent

Total: 35.4 percent
   
So payments to individuals accounted for almost half of federal expenditures. Why is this important? It’s a question of control, Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution told us when we originally looked at this question.
   
These transfer payments, as they are known, ""can be more or less freely spent by private individuals,"" Burtless said. ""Your mom can spend her Social Security check any way she wants -- on food, shelter, vacations at Disney World or deposits in her bank account or her favorite mutual fund. Even cash public assistance recipients have pretty wide freedom over how they spend their welfare checks.""
   
Some transfer payments are more restrictive, such as food stamps or Medicare and Medicaid benefits, but these still allow some degree of consumer choice.
   
""This distinction is important for a simple reason,"" Burtless said. While lawmakers and government officials have direct say over many types of government expenditures, ""their say over government transfers is a lot more restricted.""
   
In addition, he said, many government transfer payments ""are paid for with earmarked taxes – FICA and unemployment insurance taxes. When we get transfers from the government under Social Security, Medicare and unemployment insurance, we’re getting back the money that we or our employers contributed when we were working.""
   
While these are undoubtedly government expenditures, one could argue that they are actually pass-throughs of payments from the American public to itself. And it’s worth noting that Social Security and Medicare -- the drivers of government growth -- are among the most popular of all government programs.
   
(PolitiFact has noted that Burtless contributed $750 to Obama’s campaign in 2011. However, in 2008 he provided advice on aspects of labor policy to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., and he has worked as a government economist and served on federal advisory panels under presidents of both parties.)

Our ruling

Depending on which data set you use, Romney’s numbers are either correct or close. But they don’t tell the whole story. A large share of the spending has come not from the cost of government employees, buildings and equipment but from transfer payments that individual Americans ultimately control (and, in many cases, under programs which they had paid into to begin with).

Obama says Romney wants to turn Medicare into a voucher program
","
President Barack Obama wasted little time deriding Mitt Romney’s Medicare plan as a ""voucher program"" while talking entitlements in the first presidential debate.

""First of all, I think it's important for Gov. Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future,"" Obama said during the Oct. 3, 2012, debate at the University of Denver. ""And the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It's called premium support, but it's understood to be a voucher program.""

In the past, PolitiFact has found Obama’s ""voucher"" characterization reasonable, though as Obama noted, Republicans prefer ""premium support.""

Merriam-Webster defines a voucher as ""a written affidavit or authorization … a form or check indicating a credit against future purchases or expenditures; a coupon issued by government to a parent or guardian to be used to fund a child's education in either a public or private school.""

The plan pushed by Romney’s running mate, U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, isn’t exactly a coupon, but it’s not so far off.

Democrats have attacked Ryan’s Medicare reform ideas since he presented his first version in early 2011. Ryan has since tweaked his ideas, and Romney indicated in a summer interview that he agrees with Ryan’s most recent plan, which Ryan presented as part of his fiscal year 2013 budget proposal.

Under the current system, the federal government pays doctors and hospitals fees for particular services. That would end under the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan. Instead, beneficiaries would have the choice of receiving a fixed subsidy from the federal government that could go toward a private insurance plan or a plan similar to traditional Medicare. We should note the plan would only apply to people who are under 55 today, not current seniors.

The private plans would comply with standards set by the federal government. The amount a beneficiary receives would be based in part on the second least-expensive plan available on the health insurance exchange.

We don’t know with certainty whether the premium subsidy would be able to cover the same set of benefits as traditional Medicare, or how much it would add to out-of-pocket costs to beneficiaries, because the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office hasn’t released a detailed analysis, as it did for an earlier version of Ryan’s proposal when he provided the office with more substantial details.

Some experts in health policy say there are marked differences between the terms ""voucher"" and ""premium support."" While there are technical differences that may matter to health-policy professionals, these are not the type of differences that most beneficiaries would see as significant. In recent years, the definitions of ""premium support"" and ""vouchers"" have become almost indistinguishable.

Generally, we think ""voucher program"" is a fair way of describing to voters the vision for Medicare under a Romney-Ryan administration. We rate Obama’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/oct/04/barack-obama/obama-says-romney-wants-turn-medicare-voucher-prog/

Romney says Obama cut $716 billion from Medicare
","
Medicare figured prominently in the first debate between President Barack Obama and Republican nominee Mitt Romney.

The cost of the popular government health care program for seniors is growing rapidly and broadly believed to be unsustainable. Throughout the campaign, the candidates have been accusing each other of endangering the program, or not doing enough to maintain it.

Romney raised a charge we’ve heard before, that ""on Medicare for current retirees, (Obama) is cutting $716 billion from the program.""

What Obamacare does

The cut Romney spoke of refers to an aspect of the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare.

Obamacare does not literally cut funding from the Medicare program’s budget. Rather, the health care law instituted a number of changes to try to bring down future health care costs in the program.

The spending reductions were mainly aimed at insurance companies and hospitals, not beneficiaries. The law made significant reductions to Medicare Advantage, a subset of Medicare plans run by private insurers. Medicare Advantage was started under President George W. Bush, and the idea was that competition among the private insurers would reduce costs. But the plans have actually cost more than traditional Medicare. So the health care law scales back the payments to private insurers.

Hospitals, too, will be paid less if they have too many re-admissions, or if they fail to meet other new benchmarks for patient care.
   
The overall Medicare budget is projected to go up for the foreseeable future, even with the health care law’s cost-saving measures. The law tries to limit the program’s growth, though, making it less than it would have been without the law, but not reducing its overall budget. So claims that Obama would ""cut"" Medicare need more explanation to be fully accurate. In the past, we’ve rated similar statements Half True or Mostly False, depending on the wording and context.
   
$716 billion
       
In 2011, the CBO determined that the federal health care law would reduce Medicare outlays by $507 billion between 2012 and 2021. In a more recent estimate released this year, the CBO looked at the years 2013 to 2022 and determined the health care law affected Medicare outlays by $716 billion.
       
So it’s timing that’s making the cuts bigger, not changes to Medicare. And the cuts are from future spending, not the program’s current budget.

Our ruling
   
Romney said, ""on Medicare for current retirees, (Obama) is cutting $716 billion from the program.""

That amount -- $716 billion -- refers to Obamacare’s reductions in Medicare spending over 10 years, primarily paid to insurers and hospitals. But the statement gives the impression that the law takes money already allocated to Medicare away from current recipients.

Did Ben Unger want to stick a 15 percent tax hike to seniors?
","
PolitiFact Oregon knows there are a handful of legislative races that could determine which party controls the Oregon House in 2013. House District 29 in Washington County is one of them.

The Promote Oregon Leadership PAC, which is the campaign arm of House Republicans, put out a mailer targeting Democrat Ben Unger, a political consultant who grew up in Cornelius and is challenging incumbent Rep. Katie Eyre, R-Hillsboro. The mailer urges voters to ask the candidate these three questions should they spot him on their doorstep:

Why did he hand out anti-Nike literature while at University of Oregon? Why did he work for candidates who supported early release of violent criminals? And this: ""Why did you support a 15 percent property tax increase on Oregon seniors?"" Sources are in footnotes.

We’ll dispatch with the first two questions quickly so we can delve into the third, which is really the first question on this mailer and the one that tickles our fancy. Honestly, hitting up poor seniors on fixed incomes? How could he?

We followed up on the sources cited and figured out rather quickly that Unger circulated anti-Nike literature back in 1997 when he was vice president of the university’s student government, as part of a global effort to protest the company’s labor practices in overseas factories. (College students do that kind of thing.)

As for working ""for candidates who supported early release for violent criminals?"" Unger ran the campaign for Oregon Senate Democrats, whose candidates backed compromise prison legislation to help close the state budget. An analysis by The Oregonian discovered that a loophole resulted in the early release of hundreds of violent offenders. It was unintended, Democrats say. We’re not sure that qualifies as active support.

And now back to the claim about property taxes and seniors. We looked up the citation and found … a news story about Portland Public Schools pushing two tax measures on the May 2011 ballot. In case you don’t remember, voters approved the operating levy, and just barely killed the construction bond measure. From the article: 
But if voters say yes to both tax increases -- one for school construction and renovation, the other for school operations -- property tax bills inside the district, already among the highest in the metro area, will rise more than 15 percent in a single year. That's daunting, even to some people who consider themselves supporters of schools. 
Now, for full disclosure, the two school measures would not have accounted for the entire increase, because property taxes increase three percent every year, which is how the reporter got to the ""more than 15 percent in a single year."" Some people may think those percentage points matter, but we think that’s picayune.

The more important question is how is Unger involved? As a political consultant, he managed the campaigns for both the schools bond measure and the operating levy. It’s fair to say he supported the measures and thought it was OK to ask for the money. But is it fair to single out seniors?

Nick Smith, spokesman for the House Republican caucus, said absolutely.

""It's clear to us, at least, that senior citizens are affected most by such large increases in these taxes,"" Smith wrote. ""Voters need to know about Unger's past political work, and his support for tax increases that are especially harmful to Oregonians who are vulnerable.""

We applaud House Republicans for looking out for the elderly, but we’re not buying it. The property tax increases would have applied just as well to wealthy people, young people, middle-aged people and lower-income working people, people who like cats, people who hate children, and so on.

Look, we know this is standard campaigning. Take a candidate’s position on an issue and weed out the context so you end up with something like Unger supported ""a 15 percent property tax increase on Oregon seniors,"" as if he wanted to single out old folks for additional taxes. To us, the statement is missing important details that voters should have. But then, the mailers wouldn’t be as fun, would they?

"['Candidate Biography', 'Florida', 'Lois Frankel']","
Lois Frankel says Adam Hasner promised ""I'll never accept a pay increase,” but he “voted to raise his pay four times.""
","
Democrat Lois Frankel bashed her Republican congressional opponent Adam Hasner and portrayed him as a hypocrite in a recent attack ad.

In the ad, Hasner says, ""I'll never accept a pay increase."" A narrator then notes, ""But Hasner voted to raise his pay four times."" In this fact-check, we will evaluate the ad's claim.

We previously fact-checked a claim in an ad by the YG Action Fund, a conservative PAC, that Frankel ""took a 40 percent pay raise"" as mayor while West Palm Beach ""lost jobs."" We ruled that claim Half True -- she did get a 40 percent raise, but the ad misrepresented the employment picture.

Hasner said he’ll reject a pay increase

In Frankel’s ad, Hasner said, ""I’ll never accept a pay increase."" It’s not evident in the ad when he said that.

The answer is that Hasner has repeatedly said it while running for Congress -- a federal job that currently pays $174,000 a year job.

But Hasner’s pay raise votes relate to his former job in the state House, where he served from 2003 to 2010. In the state House, Hasner earned between $29,328 and $31,932 a year.

When state workers get raises, legislators get automatic salary adjustments in July of the following year unless they pass a bill to prevent the raise. Both situations occurred during Hasner’s tenure: He got raises some years, and other years members prevented the raises or even took a cut as a symbolic gesture to voters amid an economic downturn.

Frankel points to votes for pay raises Hasner took in 2003, 2005, 2006 and 2010.

All four votes were appropriations bills that legislators must pass to pay for state workers’ salaries and expenses to keep government functioning -- they were not stand-alone votes on pay raises. We confirmed these votes, and found that the appropriations bills passed the House with wide margins.

We agree with the first three votes cited by Frankel -- Hasner voted in favor of appropriations bills in 2003, 2005 and 2006 that led to salary raises between 2 and 3.6 percent for legislators.

But the fourth vote -- the one in 2010 -- comes with a major caveat: lawmakers accidentally gave themselves a pay raise when they meant to take a pay cut, blaming it on a ""drafting error,"" according to the Florida Times-Union. The article stated that Hasner, the majority leader, promised to fix the bill in negotiations with the Senate. Ultimately their salaries remained the same as the previous year: $29,697

Legislators voted for pay cuts in 2008 and 2009 that took effect that same year. Hasner also had a few years where his salary remained flat.

Hasner claimed credit for the pay cut in 2008. The Sun-Sentinel wrote that the pay cut was proposed by state Rep. Ron Saunders, D-Key West, in a meeting and then by state Rep. Juan Zapata, R-Miami, on the House floor. Hasner, the House majority leader, told the Sentinel that he worked behind the scenes to get the pay cut:

""Just because Juan Zapata was the name behind the amendment doesn't mean I wasn't a catalyst behind the idea. Leadership is more than just putting your name on something.""

Hasner gave PolitiFact a similar account: ""You don’t put your name on every amendment when you are majority leader. ... I led the effort to cut my pay in the state Legislature when things got tough."" (He reiterated that he led the pay cut effort in a September speech.) 
Overall, Hasner entered the House in 2003 making $29,328. His pay peaked in 2007 at $31,932. He left the House in 2010 making $29,697.

 Our ruling

Frankel’s ad says Hasner said ""I'll never accept a pay increase,"" but he ""voted to raise his pay four times."" We have several criticisms of this claim.

For starters, Frankel didn’t make it clear that Hasner said he would never accept a pay increase if elected to Congress -- it's possible to view the ad and falsely think he said that while accepting pay raises in the state House. There is a significant difference between saying that he would freeze his own congressional pay at around $174,000 and voting for overall budget bills that included measly pay raises in the state House that took his pay from $29,328 to $31,932 (and then back down again).

Also, Frankel omits that Hasner’s pay was frozen or cut for a few of his years in the House. And for one of those votes he did vote for a pay raise, but then House members said that was an accident, and they ultimately didn’t get a raise. Yes, Frankel says that he ""voted"" for the pay raises -- not that he ""received"" them. Right away Hasner said that was a mistake and would be fixed, and it was.

There is a small kernel of truth here: Hasner did vote for three overall budgets that allowed himself to get a small pay raise.

Chris Christie says state income tax jumped from 2 percent when it was first enacted to 9 percent now
","
Whet the appetite of liberal politicians with a new tax and Gov. Chris Christie warns they’ll become ravenous. 

That’s why Christie told a crowd in New Hampshire they should vote on Nov. 6 for Ovide Lamontagne, the Republican candidate for governor of the Granite State. Otherwise New Hampshire, which doesn’t tax wages, may go the way of New Jersey.

Christie said 35 years ago New Jersey also didn’t have an income tax, but then ""Governor Brendan Byrne, a Democrat, said if you just give me a small income tax, just a little one, I will lower your property taxes, for the people who have the highest property taxes in America back in 1977. So 35 years later, what have we got? We still have the highest property taxes in America and the income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent -- 9 percent.

""Here's the key everybody: you let a liberal politician in the door and give them permission to give you a new tax, they only know one direction for that tax to go and that's up,"" Christie said at the Sept. 25 event.

Did New Jersey’s income tax more than quadruple since it was first enacted, as Christie said?

The governor’s statement is partially accurate because a group of individuals -- those earning more than $500,000 in taxable income -- are now subject to a statutory income tax rate of 8.97 percent.

But those individuals represent only a small percentage of filers in New Jersey and the tax rates are lower for other income levels. 

The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment, but the history of the state’s income tax is clear.

In 1976 -- during Byrne’s first term -- the state passed a temporary income tax with two rates. 

A 2 percent rate was levied on income less than $20,000 or about $80,000 in today’s dollars, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. 

Income in excess of $20,000 was taxed at the top rate of 2.5 percent.  

A year after the temporary tax was enacted, the state made it permanent. 

Over time New Jersey modeled its income tax into a more progressive system, which now has rates ranging from 1.4 percent to 8.97 percent depending on income level and filing status.

The state’s top rate is 8.97 percent, which only applies to income in excess of $500,000. Less than 2 percent of taxable New Jersey resident returns in 2009 had that level of income, according to state Treasury Department data. 

An individual with taxable income between $75,000 and $500,000 pays a 6.37 percent rate on that income. For income between $40,000 and $75,000, the rate is about 5.5 percent.

The lowest rates are 1.4 percent and 1.75 percent, which are lower than the state’s rates in 1976. Those rates apply to incomes below $20,000 or between $20,000 and $35,000, respectively.

So for Christie to suggest the income tax, in general, jumped from 2 percent to 9 percent is misleading. That’s true for one income level, but the statement oversimplifies New Jersey’s current income tax system.

Our ruling

Christie said, ""The income tax that started at 2 percent under Governor Byrne is now 9 percent.""

When the state first implemented an income tax in 1976, two rates existed -- 2 percent for income less than $20,000 and 2.5 percent for income more than $20,000 -- but the state has since introduced a more progressive tax system. 

New Jersey’s top rate is nearly 9 percent now, but applies only to taxable income above $500,000.

Every other income bracket is subject to a rate lower than 9 percent, with some income levels charged a rate of less than 2 percent.  

We rate this statement Half True.

Ohio Republican Party says Issue 2 would create a redistricting commission with a blank check to spend
","
A frequent criticism of Issue 2, the redistricting reform proposal before Ohio voters on Nov. 6, is its cost to taxpayers.

The Ohio Republican Party played that card when it sent out a campaign flier Sept. 11, 2012, with a warning about the 12-member redistricting commission that Issue 2 would establish. Its claim:

""They’ll have a blank check to spend our money.""

The claim is a common theme used in the campaign against Issue 2. PolitiFact Ohio decided to check it out.

Issue 2 is a proposed amendment to the Ohio Constitution that would reform the way the state’s Congressional and legislative boundaries are drawn, a process known as redistricting that happens every 10 years.

Elected officials, including the governor and legislative leaders, control the current process. District boundary lines typically are drawn to favor whichever party is in power. Last year, Republicans, who control state government, drew new lines that grouped voters into districts designed to help Republicans win future elections.

Issue 2 would remove elected officials from the redistricting process and hand the responsibility over to a new redistricting commission. Should Issue 2 pass, a commission would be appointed next year to draw new maps for the 2014 election.

The GOP claim is based on language in Issue 2 that addresses funding for commission members’ salaries, staff, office space, legal counsel and other expenses. The proposal says ""the General Assembly shall make appropriations necessary to adequately fund the activities of the commission.""

But that that’s not the same as having a blank check. ""Necessary to adequately fund"" the commission’s activities indicates there must be some basis of support for funding.

Subsequent to the GOP sending out the mailer, the Ohio Supreme Court took that very position.  

The group supporting Issue 2, Voters First Ohio, sued to challenge a summary of Issue 2 that would appear on voters’ ballots. The Ohio Ballot Board, as it does with all state ballot issues, approved a summary ballot language.

Voters First said in its lawsuit that the summary was misleading -- specifically a portion that said Issue 2 would ""mandate the General Assembly to appropriate all funds as determined by the commission.""

That sounds similar to the Ohio GOP’s claim that the commission would have a blank check.

In its Sept. 12 ruling, the Ohio Supreme Court specifically said the proposal would not provide the commission with a ""blank check."" The court, by a 6-1 vote, agreed with Voters First that the ballot summary was misleading.

""The actual text of the proposed constitutional amendment does not state that the redistricting commission would have – as the ballot board’s language indicates – a blank check for all funds as determined by the commission. Rather, the proposed constitutional amendment expressly limits appropriations for the commission to those ‘necessary to adequately fund the activities’ of the commission,"" the ruling said.

A lawyer representing the Republican Party defended using the term blank check at a recent Ohio Elections Commission hearing. The commission held a probable cause hearing Sept. 20 on the GOP’s campaign literature after Voters First filed a complaint saying the mailer was inaccurate.

Attorney Terrence O’Donnell told the commission that blank check is a ""well understood political figure of speech"" and that the average voter would not infer that the commission literally would be allowed to fill in the dollar amount on a blank check.

The elections commission’s probable cause panel split along party lines, 2-2, about whether to hold a full hearing to examine whether Republicans’ claim about the blank check was accurate. Without a majority, the matter was dropped.

We asked the Ohio GOP if it wanted to offer any other arguments to support its claim. Spokesman Matthew Henderson directed us to Carlo LoParo, spokesman for the anti-Issue 2 group, Protect Your Vote Ohio.

LoParo said the claim was not meant to suggest to voters that the commission would have unlimited funds. He said the phrase was meant to convey ""an amount that is unknown, yet substantial.""

Citing a story published June 9, 2012, in The Sacramento Bee, LoParo said a redistricting commission in California, similar to the one proposed in Ohio, spent $10 million drawing political boundaries. The California redistricting commission initially estimated its work would cost about $3 million.

LoParo said Issue 2’s vague wording, which does not cap spending at a specific dollar amount, would allow the commission to sue for more money if it decided lawmakers did not give them enough.

That may be true, but it would still require a showing that additional money was ""necessary to adequately fund the activities.""

So, where does that leave us?

Issue 2 would provide the redistricting commission with funds ""necessary to adequately fund the activities"" of the commission. The Ohio Supreme Court said this qualification does not entitle the commission to a blank check. But the Ohio Republican Party and Issue 2 opponents argue the court was being too literal, that the term blank check is a figure of speech that conveys a large, unknown amount of money.

Even if most voters don’t take the Ohio Republican Party’s statement to mean an actual blank check would be presented to the redistricting commission, the phrase ""blank check"" does presume an unchecked spending authority.

But, as the Ohio Supreme Court ruled, the proposed amendment places a qualification on spending. If the commission were to ask for more money than initially provided, as LoParo hypothesized, it would have to show the spending is necessary.

There is no specific cap on spending in the amendment, but that does not mean the commission will be able to spend as much as it wants.

Ann Coulter says Rhode Island was one of first states to pass Voter ID law
","Little Rhody got a national shout out on ABC’s talk show ""The View"" on Sept. 27, 2012.  That’s  when subtle-as-napalm conservative pundit Ann Coulter used Rhode Island’s 2011 voter-identification law to rebut the charge that such legislation is a Republican scheme to steal elections by making it harder for poor and minority voters to vote.

""One of the first states in the union to pass a voter ID bill was Rhode Island, 85 percent Democratic legislature,"" she told cohost Joy Behar, after Behar suggested that Republicans were pushing voter identification not to stop fraud but to reduce Democratic turnout.

""And who pushed it?,"" Coulter asked. ""A black Democrat in the House, a black Democrat in the Senate. That's a fact!""

Democrats in individual states, and nationally, have sought to discredit voter-identification initiatives,  charging they are part of a Republican strategy to make it harder for people who have historically favored Democrats to get the paperwork they need.

As Coulter’s counterpunch showed, Rhode Island’s voter identification law, passed last year,  has emerged as a Republican talking point to dispute accusations of partisanship.

In this item, we will check Coulter’s claim that Rhode Island was a leader in voter-identification legislation. We will examine the second part of her statement in a separate item.

Rhode Island,  where 83.5 percent of the state’s legislators are Democrats, is an exception to the national trend on voter-identification, but, despite what Coulter claimed, it is far from being ""one of the first"" states to pass such legislation.

According to the National Conference of State Legislatures, as of Sept. 5,  2012,  31 states had enacted some form of voter identification law. At least 12 did so between 2003-2010, well before Governor Lincoln Chafee signed Rhode Island’s law in July 2011.

Which state actually was the first is unclear. For the modern era, it appears the first state to require voters to verify their identity appears to be South Carolina, in 1950, said Jennie Bower, a senior fellow who researches the issue for the council. Rhode Island isn’t even the first state in New England to require identification; Connecticut did it in 1993.

Our ruling

Ann Coulter said Rhode Island was one of the first states to enact voter-identification laws. It isn’t.  At least a dozen states had such laws earlier, making Rhode Island closer to the middle of the pack.

Ann Coulter says Rhode Island’s voter-identification law was pushed by black legislators in the state House and Senate
","
Usually, as Election Day draws closer, it’s the candidates who get more and more scrutiny. But one of the new wrinkles in American politics in 2012 has been not just the fight over who is running, but who will be voting.

Over the past few years, several states have enacted voter-identification laws that Republicans claim will help prevent voter fraud and Democrats claim will disenfranchise poor and minority -- and mostly Democratic -- voters.

Rhode Island’s 2011 voter-identification law has become a bit player in that debate. Republican commentators regularly cite it to push back against the partisan accusations,  noting that the law was passed by the overwhelmingly Democratic Rhode Island General Assembly.

And that’s exactly what conservative pundit Ann Coulter did Thursday on ABC’s ""The View."" When View cohost Joy Behar suggested voter-identification legislation seemed aimed at the poor and minorities, Coulter was ready.

""One of the first states in the union to pass voter ID bill was Rhode Island, 85 percent Democratic legislature,"" she said. ""And who pushed it? A black Democrat in the house, a black Democrat in the senate. That's a fact!""

We look at Coulter’s one-of-the-first claim in a separate item; here we examine the claims of minority legislative support.

And the facts show Coulter is right.

In the Rhode Island Senate, the bill’s main sponsor was Sen. Harold Metts, D-Providence, an African-American. The House version was co-sponsored by House Speaker Gordon Fox, the first black lawmaker to lead the state lower chamber, among others.

Further,  the bill got a crucial boost when state Rep. Anastasia Williams, D-Providence, who is of African -American and Panamanian descent, also supported it.

She testified about how she suspected someone had voted in her name in 2006 (no complaint was filed) and how she’d once seen a man vote twice at her local polling place.

Their support came despite aggressive lobbying against the bill by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the American Civil Liberties Union, Ocean State Action and the Rhode Island Commission for Human Rights.

It passed the House 54 to 21 and the Senate 27 to 6, with five not voting.

Our ruling

Ann Coulter said the voter-identification passed by the Rhode Island legislature was pushed by black senators and representatives. In fact, in both the House and the Senate, black legislators strongly supported the bill.

We rule her statement True.
