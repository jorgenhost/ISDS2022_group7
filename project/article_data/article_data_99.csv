TV ad by Senate Majority PAC misleads on Joe Heck's bank donations, proposed tax breaks
","A pro-Democratic Super PAC with close ties to Nevada Sen. Harry Reid is spending roughly $850,000 on a new ad attempting to paint Republican Rep. Joe Heck as a creature of Wall Street. Senate Majority PAC’s new ad suggests that banks ""invested"" in the Republican Senate hopeful through campaign donations, and that their investment paid off. ""They’ve invested over $300,000 in him, and Heck has sponsored $44 million dollars in tax breaks for banks,"" the ad states. This ad marks one of the largest chunks of outside spending in the highly competitive Nevada Senate race. But claiming banks invested in Heck and then received tax breaks takes an acrobatic chronology of what actually happened. Donations Over his entire congressional career, Heck has actually raised more than the $300,000 amount from the banking industry referenced in the ad. The most recent figure from the ""secruities and investment"" category on the nonpartisan opensecrets.org is $473,819. However, this is a career-wide total, and it includes the $381,700 raised for his ongoing Senate run. Heck raised $92,119, a much more modest figure, for his other three congressional runs combined. That’s a lot of money, but it’s worth taking the typically massive size of congressional fundraising hauls into consideration. For example, Heck’s $35,472 in donations from the ""securities and investment"" industry during his successful 2014 re-election bid is a drop in the bucket compared to the total $2.4 million raised throughout that campaign. And as for references to ""investing,"" the tax breaks mentioned in the ad actually refer to a bill Heck championed as a state senator — years before the $300,000 in donations referenced in the ad. Heck did take campaign funds from banks and their associated PACs during this time. A PolitiFact tally found that Heck received around $21,800 from the banking industry through his four years in the state Senate. Again, that isn’t a small figure, but it’s a much smaller amount than what Heck raked in from the state’s casino giants and the medical industry over the same time period. Tax breaks Regardless of the donations, Heck did sponsor an ultimately failed piece of legislation in the state Senate that sought to reduce the payroll tax burden on Nevada financial institutions — what the ad calls ""$44 million in tax breaks for banks."" Though the ad prominently features a looming image of the U.S. Capitol Dome, the bill would have only applied to Nevada banks. We’ve previously explored the somewhat confusing history of Nevada’s payroll tax (also called the Modified Business Tax, or MBT), created as a compromise to fund new K-12 education programs during a fierce 2003 battle over new taxes. State lawmakers historically fiddle with the exact rates and exemptions levels for the payroll tax, but there has been one constant — banks and other financial institutions are charged at a higher rate than any other business (2 percent), and also pay so-called ""franchise taxes"" for each branch office past the first one in each county ($7,000 a year). Nevada bankers have long grumbled about the higher tax rates, and have attempted to reduce them back down to the level paid by other state businesses, most recently in 2015. That’s what Heck was doing in 2007 when he introduced SB 233, which proposed rolling back the payroll tax rate on banks to the level applied to other state businesses and repealing the ""franchise tax"" for multiple branch offices. Saying the bill was about ""equity and fairness,"" Heck argued that the higher rate applied to banks created more tax revenue than projected and stifled the industry’s economic growth. ""This could be a bill about basket weavers,"" he said at a committee hearing. ""This bill is about an inequitable system that singles out an industry for a tax the rest of business and industry does not pay."" Democrats on the committee said banks were uniquely prepared to handle a higher tax burden, and that they weren’t suffering at the time despite the higher taxes. ""I have not seen a bank go out of business in this state; the banks I am aware of are setting record profits,"" Democratic state Sen. Mike Schneider said during a hearing on the bill. As for the tax-cut figure, both the state’s Taxation Department and Heck himself estimated the legislation would cost the state around $44.2 million in revenue — a little more than $38 million in payroll taxes and another $5.9 million by axing the branch franchise tax. Heck pointed out that those cuts would make up less than 1 percent of the state’s $6.9 billion two-year budget. The bill itself would have affected around 2,450 Nevada businesses at the time, and the amended version would have lowered the tax for the 55,000 businesses paying the payroll levy. Heck wasn’t the only Republican leading the charge on reducing the tax burden for banks, as former Gov. Jim Gibbons made repealing the bank franchise tax a priority in his 2007 State of the State address. Ultimately, the bill went nowhere. After being amended and passed out of committee, Senate leaders placed it in legislative limbo and let it expire without any more votes. Although lawmakers approved major changes to the state’s payroll tax in 2015, the higher rate on financial institutions hasn’t changed since 2003. Senate Majority PAC spokesman Shripal Shah said the measure indicated to the banking industry that Heck would be in their corner if elected to Senate. ""Banks have invested in Joe Heck's campaigns because they know he has a history of working for their interests and would continue doing their bidding in the Senate if he has the opportunity,"" he said in an email. Regardless, this isn’t the first time Heck’s opponents have tried to ding him over the proposal. Democratic Congresswoman Dina Titus criticized him over it during a 2010 debate between the two House candidates. Heck responded with largely the same language he used in testifying for the bill in 2007, saying the point was to make the state’s tax system more equitable. Our ruling A new ad from Senate Majority PAC claims banks ""have invested over $300,000 in him, and Heck has sponsored $44 million dollars in tax breaks for banks."" The implication that funds raised from the banking industry were an ""investment"" in Heck is highly misleading. The majority of bank donations came during Heck’s current run for U.S. Senate, nine years after sponsoring a bill that would have lowered the payroll tax rate for banks. Because it’s so misleading, we rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280976B2A40>],/factchecks/2016/jul/12/senate-majority-pac/senate-majority-pac-releases-misleading-tv-ad-agai/
"['Criminal Justice', 'PunditFact', 'William Johnson']","
Law enforcement lobbyist says pro-police speech is 'markedly absent' from Obama
","After five police officers were killed in an attack in Dallas, critics targeted President Barack Obama’s rhetoric on policing and police brutality. It’s a huge departure from the past, when political leaders spoke out forcefully against brutality against law enforcement, said William Johnson, the executive director of the National Association of Police Organizations, which lobbies on behalf of a variety of police unions and associations, on Fox News July 8, the morning after the shooting. ""I think one of the big differences then was you had governors and mayors and the president — whether it was President Johnson or President Nixon, Republican or Democrat — condemning violence against the police and urging support for the police. ""Today that's markedly absent,"" Johnson continued. ""I think that's a huge difference, and that's directly led to the climate that allows these attacks to happen."" Johnson says that Obama has not supported the police or condemned violence against them. That’s a serious charge, and a quick look at the public record shows this isn’t true. Johnson’s comment came before Obama announced he would attend a July 12 memorial for the fallen police officers. What Obama has said We’ll start with what he said after the murders of the Dallas officers July 7. Speaking from Warsaw, Poland, Obama condemned violence against police and praised police officers in seven hours after the Dallas attack. ""As I told Mayor (Mike) Rawlings, I believe that I speak for every single American when I say that we are horrified over these events, and that we stand united with the people and the police department in Dallas,"" Obama said. Obama also spoke the day before the Dallas attacks in response to the shootings of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana by police officers. Most of the statement focused on the need for reform in policing, but Obama also addressed the idea that police were under attack in the debate about excessive force. ""And so, to all of law enforcement, I want to be very clear: We know you have a tough job. We mourn those in uniform who are protecting us who lose their lives,"" Obama said. That’s just what Obama has said on this topic in the past week. During the Baltimore riots sparked by the death of Freddie Gray in 2015, Obama spoke against the violence and expressed his sympathy for police officers in Baltimore. ""My heart goes out to the police officers who were injured in the past few days. They showed extraordinary restraint ... it shows how tough a job policing can be,"" Obama said. Obama also issued a statement after two New York police officers were shot by a man who claimed to be acting in response to the death of Michael Brown and Eric Garner at the hands of police. He actually used the word ""condemn."" ""I unconditionally condemn today's murder of two police officers in New York City,"" Obama said. ""Two brave men won't be going home to their loved ones tonight, and for that, there is no justification. The officers who serve and protect our communities risk their own safety for ours every single day."" Here are several other examples: Before a meeting of the International Association of Chiefs of Police in 2015, Obama said: ""I reject any narrative that seeks to divide police and communities that they serve. I reject a storyline that says when it comes to public safety there’s an ‘us’ and a ‘them’ –- a narrative that too often gets served up to us by news stations seeking ratings, or tweets seeking retweets, or political candidates seeking some attention."" A May 8, 2015, White House proclamation on Peace Officers Memorial Day and Police Week read: ""As President, I am committed to making sure America's dedicated police officers receive the support and recognition they have earned, and to doing all I can to protect those who protect us."" In response to violence in the St. Louis-area after the shooting of Michael Brown, Obama said: ""There is never an excuse for violence against police, or for those who would use this tragedy as a cover for vandalism or looting."" You can read more of Obama’s comments about police in this 2014 fact-check. NAPO’s complaints We tried to reach out to Johnson and did not hear back. But on July 12, his organization posted a lengthy statement about a meeting it had with Obama and Vice President Joe Biden ""in direct response to NAPO’s statement accusing the Administration of not fully supporting our nation’s law enforcement officers,"" a statement published on NAPO’s website said. The NAPO account of the meeting has the president asking how he could have better responded to police shootings. Johnson said the administration had failed to address violence and threats against police that he linked to Black Lives Matter. In his account — much more measured than Johnson’s critique on Fox — Johnson acknowledged that the administration had condemned violence against police officers, but he said it had only done so after officers had been killed. ""There has been no response, no condemnation when Black Lives Matter protests turn violent. There was no outrage when two St. Louis County police officers were shot by a Ferguson protester who was at a Black Lives Matter protest. There is no demand for accountability from the movement when members support violence towards police or even act on those calls for violence,"" NAPO’s statement reads. This speaks directly to Johnson’s broader critique of Obama’s response to violence against police, but it seems to get some details wrong. As noted above, Obama has spoken out against violent protests in Ferguson and Baltimore, though no officers died in either of those protests. After two officers were shot in Ferguson in March of 2015, Obama issued this response on Twitter: ""Violence against police is unacceptable. Our prayers are with the officers in MO. Path to justice is one all of us must travel together."" In response to a question after the Dallas attack about the tactics of Black Lives Matter protesters, Obama said he did not think it was fair to blame the entire movement for the statements of some of its members. ""Now, in a movement like Black Lives Matter, there’s always going to be some folks who say things that are stupid, or imprudent, or overgeneralized, or harsh.  And I don't think that you can hold well-meaning activists who are doing the right thing and peacefully protesting responsible for everything that is uttered at a protest site,"" Obama said. Johnson also said that former Attorney General Eric Holder had undermined police officers in his response to the non-indictment of Darren Wilson, who shot and killed Brown in Ferguson.  Holder had said that he wanted lower standards of proof for civil rights crimes, like the one the Department of Justice had considered charging Wilson with. But this is tangentially related to the question of how Obama responded to violence against police. Looking back in time Johnson mentioned presidents Richard Nixon and Lyndon B. Johnson as models of presidents who had police officers’ backs. Nixon and Johnson both served at a time when violence against police was much more common than it is today. During the 1970s, an average of 127 police officers were shot and killed every year, higher than the average of 71 in the 1960s and much higher than 53 this decade.The overall crime rate was higher in the late 1960s and early 1970s than it is today, and the nation faced large-scale riots in many urban centers. In this context, Nixon and Johnson both expressed support for police officers and laid out programs to support them. Nixon made support for the police a central part of his ""law and order"" message in his electoral campaigns. In 1970, Nixon issued a statement saying he was ""deeply concerned with the growing problem of assaults on police officers."" Johnson, Nixon and Obama’s shared support for police was typical of other presidents and politicians, according to Jeremy Mayer, a professor at George Mason University who has written on presidential politics in the last half of the 20th century. ""What differentiates American politicians, somewhat in the ‘60s and even more today, is the degree of sympathy which they express for the victims of police brutality,"" Mayer said. ""But even the politicians who are sympathetic to the victims of police brutality always or almost always simultaneously express support for the vast majority of police officers."" Obama has been more likely than either Nixon or Johnson, Mayer said, to combine his statements of support for the police with concerns about police brutality and discriminatory policing. Our ruling Johnson said Obama had failed to condemn violence against police. Obama has repeatedly condemned violence against police. Most recently, he expressed his support for police the night before the Dallas attack happened, amid protests over two police shootings of black men, and again after the sniper attack on police officers. Obama’s consistent objections to violence against police is similar to rhetoric by Johnson, Nixon and the vast majority of American politicians and presidents. Johnson’s statement is outrageously wrong.

Does Dallas have fewest police shootings in America? Impossible to tell
","The morning after the ambush killing of five Dallas police officers, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings said the police department has cultivated positive relationships with the Dallas community. The agency, he said, has trained in de-escalating encounters and community policing. ""I want to brag just for a second if anybody hasn't heard us say this,"" he said at a news conference July 8. ""This year, we have the fewest police officer-related shootings than any large city in America."" Rawlings made a similar claim on MSNBC’s Morning Joe that same day. Even though his statement is unclear, a spokesperson confirmed the mayor was referring to shootings by, not directed at, officers. We wanted to know if there was support for his statement. The best data we have suggests the mayor might be right, but we can’t know for sure. No nationwide data There is a major stumbling block with claims like these: There is no national database of police shootings. The FBI does collect some data on justifiable homicides by law enforcement, but it’s not broken down to the city level. The agency also issues a Law Enforcement Officers Killed and Assaulted report, but it only goes up to 2014 (and it doesn’t cover people killed or wounded by officers). To make matters more complicated, the FBI’s numbers are provided voluntarily by law enforcement agencies. (Only a small fraction of the 18,000 agencies who voluntarily participate in the program provide deadly force data.) ""Some cities would only report certain types of shootings,"" said Jonathan Maskaly, a criminology professor at the University of Texas at Dallas. ""Others would report everything. Cities with problems would tend to obfuscate."" Maskaly said verifying Rawlings’ claim — especially the ""all large cities"" component — is difficult without a comprehensive database. That said, we were able to find officer-related shooting data for specific police departments, as well as documentation of lethal force from media sources. These accounts, while limited, do show Dallas has a low number of shootings by police compared to other cities. Dallas vs. the rest of Texas The Washington Post tracks fatal police shootings nationwide, as does The Guardian. Both recorded the same incidents — five lethal shootings in Dallas in 2015, and one in 2016. A Dallas Police Department spokesperson pointed us to online officer-involved shooting data. The department’s ""officer-involved shooting"" data included lethal shots, shots that injured, and shots that missed. As a result of the broader parameters, the police department’s data shows 11 shootings in 2015, but still just one for 2016. There’s just one problem — the one shooting the newspapers found in 2016 is different from the one in Dallas’ data. The Guardian and Post included a shooting by a Mesquite Police Department officer in Dallas, whereas the police department data only counts its own officers. We did our own count using these three sources plus a Google News search. The result revealed one additional shooting by a Dallas officer. The numbers vary depending on if the data includes shootings by non-Dallas police officers that happened in Dallas (such as by the Mesquite Police Department) or just those by Dallas officers. Including non-DPD officers, there were 12 officer-involved shootings in Dallas in 2015 and three in 2016. Counting only the Dallas Police Department, however, there were 11 in 2015 and two in 2016. This is what Rawlings was referring to. What about other major Texas cities? We defined ""large city"" using the Census Bureau, looking at cities comparable to Dallas’ estimated 1.28 million people. Houston had 16 officer-involved shootings this year and 32 in 2015. San Antonio police reported five such incidents in 2016. Austin didn’t have available data, but an April news report counted five officer-involved 2016 shootings by the Austin Police Department as of that time. In total, there were two police-related shootings by Dallas police in 2016 — less than Houston, San Antonio and Austin. A broader look Rawlings said Dallas had fewer officer-related shootings than ""any large city"" in 2016, not just any large Texas city. So we looked around the country to see if any large departments reported fewer than the two police-related shootings we found by Dallas police. Data for the San Diego Police Department, captured by the county district attorney, show eight officer-involved shootings in 2015. We spoke to a county spokesperson, who told us there were three officer-involved shootings by the San Diego police in 2016. Officers of the Los Angeles Police Department shot 38 people in 2015. Data for 2016 wasn’t available, but scrolling through the LAPD’s press releases, we counted 11 officer-involved shootings. We also counted six officer-involved shootings in Las Vegas in 2016, at least 24 in 2015 for Chicago, and 21 in Phoenix for 2014.   The list of ""large cities"" could go on indefinitely, and there is no guarantee we wouldn’t eventually find one with less than the two officer-involved shootings from Dallas police. To keep it simple, we checked eight cities in addition to Dallas — including San Antonio, Houston, Austin, San Diego, Los Angeles, Chicago, Las Vegas and Phoenix. From what we could find, Dallas police had the lowest number (two) of officer-involved shootings in 2016. Other measures Experts agreed that Dallas had a low number of officer-involved shootings compared to other cities. ""If the data is correct — I would agree that Dallas has a low number of police shootings especially when compared with similar size cities,"" said David Hurley, assistant professor of criminal justice at Texas A&M University. However, counting the number of police shootings is the wrong metric to consider, said John Worrall, professor of criminology at the University of Texas at Dallas. He and Maskaly both pointed to shootings-per-officer or shootings-per-capita as more informative measure. However, there is no available data for strictly 2016 on that point. The Better Government Association published  a July 2015 study of fatal police shootings in major cities between 2010-2014. Looking at that data, which is compiled via public records requests from police departments, Dallas had 34, more than San Antonio (28), San Diego (17) and San Jose (11). Dallas also had higher fatal shootings-per-capita than several cities during that period, including those with more fatal shootings overall such as Chicago and New York City. Our ruling Mayor Rawlings said Dallas had fewer officer-related shootings in 2016 than any other large city. There is no national database to compare Dallas with every single other large metropolitan area, so it is nearly impossible to verify that side of the claim. However, numerous sources suggest Dallas does, in fact, have a low number of officer-involved shootings compared to cities of similar sizes with available data. For that reason, we rate Rawlings’ statement Half True. Editor's note: This fact-check was updated July 13 with correct information from the San Diego Police Department to show three police-involved shootings for 2016, not two as originally reported. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/ae42a763-78c9-44fc-9d7c-725105a8be16",[<zip object at 0x00000280978405C0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/12/mike-rawlings/does-dallas-have-fewest-police-shootings-america-i/

No, you're still not being forced 'to buy government health care'
","Carlos Beruff, Marco Rubio’s Republican opponent in the U.S. Senate race, says he’s had enough of people in Washington making decisions and controlling people’s lives. Beruff’s new campaign ad, dubbed ""Clean House,"" criticizes government intrusion into American life. ""The folks in Washington have it all figured out,"" Beruff says in the ad. ""They’re going to make your choices and run your life."" He continued: ""They’re already forcing you to buy government health care."" PolitiFact is very familiar with inaccurate statements about the health care law. In fact, four out of seven PolitiFact Lies of the Year have been related to the Affordable Care Act, including that the 2010 law was a ""government takeover of health care."" The Lie of the Year in 2010 debunked statements that suggested the Affordable Care Act represented a ""government takeover of health care."" The main finding was that the plan would increase government regulation, but it would continue to rely on private insurers to provide coverage for most Americans. Beruff’s claim falls into a similar trap because it glazes over private insurers’ roles, but doesn’t go as far as to suggest a government takeover. The individual mandate Beruff’s spokesperson cited the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which requires most individuals to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty, called the individual shared responsibility payment. That mandate, which took effect in 2014, is due every month an individual doesn’t have health insurance that meets the minimum essential coverage. The penalty is assessed on tax returns, and increases every year a person remains uninsured.   No one is forced to buy government health insurance via the individual mandate, but individuals are strongly incentivized to have the minimum essential health coverage to avoid the penalty. Some may consider the individual mandate to be ""forcing"" people to get coverage, but people can choose to remain without health insurance and defer to the fine, said Ben Sommers, an assistant professor of health and economics at the Harvard T.H. School of Public Health. Beruff’s point isn’t flat-out wrong, but his word choice is problematic, said Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicaid and Medicare under President George H.W. Bush. She said she wouldn’t have used the word ""forced"" because the mandate only strongly encourages having health care coverage, and it doesn’t have to be government coverage if your employer offers private insurance. The individual mandate has many exemptions depending on income, membership in groups like Indian tribes, and incarceration. If individuals don’t fall into those categories, the Health Insurance Marketplace lays out 14 categories of hardship exemptions that exempt people from the financial penalty if they cannot afford it. ""Hardship"" exemptions cover homelessness, filing for bankruptcy and foreclosure, and a family member’s death, to name a few examples. Dissecting ‘government health care’ Beruff’s bigger problem is with his characterization of the Affordable Care Act as ""government health care."" Yes, the mandate requires Americans to carry health insurance. But just as before the law, the majority obtain it from private sources, such as their employer or from choosing plans offered in health insurance marketplaces set up by federal or state regulators. The law aimed to dramatically expand public health insurance through the federal-state Medicaid program. But a Supreme Court decision has allowed 20 states, including large ones such as Texas and Florida, to not extend coverage to more low-income residents using federal dollars. In 2014, 66 percent of people had private health insurance, and 55 percent of all people received insurance from their employers, according to a report from the Census Bureau. Any type of private health insurance must meet specific set of rules in the essential benefit package, said Michael Tanner, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. But it’s still private, not government health care. Still, Tanner said it might be fair to call the coverage ""government designated health care"" because individuals can’t buy just any type of health insurance, he said. Beruff’s spokesperson echoed this argument. Our ruling Beruff said Washington politicians are ""already forcing you to buy government health care."" His statement makes a sweeping generalization, but there is some truth to the ""forcing"" part. The individual mandate incentivizes individuals to have health care or face a tax penalty. Of course, the choice is still theirs. The bigger problem is Beruff’s use of ""government health care."" This talking point was flawed around the law’s passage six years ago, and it’s no more accurate now. Just as before, the country’s health care system largely depends on the free market.

Mostly False claim that California gun control measure will 'criminalize' the sharing of bullets
"," Proposition 63, a gun and ammunition control initiative on California’s November ballot, would require instant background checks for the sale of ammunition statewide. Known as the Safety For All Initiative and proposed by Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom, the measure is considered a significant addition to California’s already strict gun regulations. The initiative is in some cases more stringent than gun control bills introduced by state Senate leader Kevin De León and recently signed into law by Gov. Jerry Brown. Recently, a gun rights group, the Firearms Policy Coalition, in a June 16 email blast claimed Proposition 63 would restrict not only ammo sales, but ""criminalize the sharing of bullets between hunting and shooting partners."" The Sacramento-based coalition describes itself as a grassroots nonprofit dedicated to defending Second Amendment rights. We decided to examine the claim: Would Proposition 63 really criminalizes the sharing of bullets between friends? Our research We started by checking the text of the Proposition. It broadly restricts ammunition sales by requiring instant background checks and requiring, by January 2018, all sales ""be conducted or processed through a licensed ammunition vendor,"" according to Section 8 of the text. Law enforcement would be exempted. Currently, the state does not require a license or record keeping for ammunition sales, according to the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. By contrast, the restrictions Proposition 63 places on sharing or ""transferring"" ammunition are not as strict. Still, they would change some aspects of the largely unregulated practice. The measure would: -- Make it illegal for an individual to share bullets with ""any person who he or she knows or using reasonable care should know"" is banned from owning or possessing ammunition; -- Make it illegal for someone to share bullets if they know they will be subsequently sold or transferred to a person banned from owning them; -- Require individuals meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition; The new crimes would be classified as a misdemeanors, punishable by up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine, according to the measure. They are listed under proposed changes to Sections 30306 and 30312 of the California Penal Code. ""They could still freely transfer and share that ammunition with their hunting and shooting partners provided that they do so in person and do not have knowledge that the ammunition would subsequently be provided to a felon or other prohibited person,"" Dan Newman, spokesman for the Safety For All Initiative, wrote in an email. Representatives from the Firearms Policy Coalition did not respond to our requests for comment. An AK-47 rifle 30-round magazine is seen with 30 rounds of 7.62x39mm ammunition, in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our ruling The Firearms Policy Coalition recently claimed California’s Proposition 63 would ""Criminalize the sharing of ammunition between friends who may be hunting or shooting together."" The initiative would create some new restrictions on bullet sharing. It would be it illegal to knowingly share bullets with a felon; to share with any other person banned from owning them; or with anyone who would subsequently share them with a banned person. It would also require people meet face-to-face to transfer ammunition. Breaking the new rules would be considered a misdemeanor. The coalition’s statement, however, gives the wrong and overly broad impression that friends on a hunting trip or at a shooting range could never legally share a bullet -- that somehow the measure would ""criminalize"" all aspects of sharing a box of bullets with your shooting partner. Instead, the vast majority of people could keep sharing, as long as they know or within reason should know they’re not sharing with a felon or another person prohibited from owning a gun and ammunition.

Did Hillary Clinton take money from countries that treat women, gays poorly?
","Donald Trump continues to attack Hillary Clinton on everything from campaign spending to ISIS. At a rally in Phoenix, he accused her of taking money from countries that have a poor rapport with women and gay people. ""She's been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women horribly,"" Trump said June 18. ""And countries that kill gays, they kill gays, they push them off of buildings."" Trump, whose campaign did not return a request for comment, seems to be referencing donations given to the Clinton Foundation. Trump has referenced her foundation ties in the past, saying she needs to ""return the $25 million"" Saudi Arabia gave the foundation. The William J. Clinton Foundation was incorporated in 1997. The foundation agreed to disclose its donors when Hillary Clinton became secretary of state in 2009. We wondered whether the Clintons’ donor list holds up to Trump’s claim. But first, it is important to note that political candidates cannot take money from foreign entities.  ""The prohibition in the Federal Election Campaign Act is against candidates or political committees soliciting, accepting or receiving contributions from foreign nationals, not only governments,"" said Michael Malbin, a political science professor at the University at Albany. Hillary Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin also noted that the former first lady played no role in the foundation while she was secretary of state. ""Further, she did not blink before standing up to countries that oppressed their people and denied them of their rights, from LGBT rights to women's rights,"" Schwerin said. Nonetheless. looking at the Clinton Foundation’s donor list, Saudi Arabia gave between $10 million and $25 million. But the foundation reported the Saudi money in December 2008, and the amount hasn’t changed since. Clinton Foundation spokesman Brian Cookstra pointed out that Saudi Arabia did not give to the foundation while Secretary Clinton was at the State Department. The foundation has also taken between $1 million and $5 million each from United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Oman. As The Wall Street Journal reported, several of these donations came in 2014, after Clinton's tenure at the State Department. We've fact-checked a similar claim before when Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus said in April 2015 that Clinton took money from the kings of ""Saudi Arabia, Morocco and Oman and Yemen."" Every country except Yemen has contributed to the Clinton Foundation, but Preibus' claim made it seem like Clinton herself took the money. We rated it Half True.  Women’s rights Human Rights Watch tracks how women are treated in each of these countries. In Saudi Arabia, a woman needs ""male guardian"" approval on everything from obtaining a passport to seeking higher education. They also have no divorce rights. The same male approval is needed for marriage in United Arab Emirates, plus laws there also allow a husband to assault his wife and children. In Qatar, marital rape is permitted. Women need a male guardian to approve a marriage contract, and one law specifies that a wife must obey her husband. And in Oman, Human Rights Watch notes that while there is a nondiscrimination law, women still face discrimination when it comes to domestic issues such as child custody and divorce. Gay rights According to the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, all sex outside of marriage, including same-sex intercourse, in Saudi Arabia is punishable by death. For a married man, the penalty is death by stoning. An unmarried man faces 100 blows of a whip. In Qatar, any sexual act outside of marriage is punishable by death. The United Arab Emirates also bans sex outside of marriage, and the death penalty could apply to consensual ""same-sex relations."" As for Oman, the country punishes same-sex acts by up to three years in prison. As for Trump's claim that these countries are throwing gay people ""off of buildings,"" he may be referring to the Islamic State. There is evidence that ISIS has engaged in these acts, but in Syria.  Executions in Saudi Arabia specifically have increased recently, but specific convictions, and whether are they related to homosexuality, are hard to measure.  Not Clinton directly Experts we spoke with questioned whether the donations to the foundation are directly attributable to Hillary Clinton. Indiana University public affairs professor emeritus Leslie Lenkowsky said Trump’s claim is hyperbolic. ""These were not donations to Secretary Clinton as such, but to an organization with which she was closely involved (when not in office or seeking it), including serving as a director,"" Lenkowsky said. According to Brian Mittendorf, an accounting professor at Ohio State University, nonprofits often have to consider donors’ actions when they give money. The stakes are usually higher when the nonprofit involves a political figure. ""These are gifts not to Clinton herself but to the foundation that shares her name,"" he said. The United States remains allies with some of these countries, such as Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar, despite their poor record with human rights. Our ruling  Trump said that Hillary Clinton has ""been given tens of millions of dollars by countries that treat women horribly...and countries that kill gays."" Trump's comment oversimplifies donations to the Clinton Foundation to make a quick attack against his Democratic rival. He makes it sound as if Clinton personally received money from foreign governments with poor records on human rights. But political candidates cannot accept donations from foreign governments. However, several countries with harsh rules for women and that kill gays have contributed to the Clinton Foundation both before and after her tenure at the State Department.  We rate Trump’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DBA340>],/factchecks/2016/jul/11/donald-trump/did-hillary-clinton-take-money-countries-treat-wom/
"['Education', 'Florida', 'Ritch Workman']","
Ritch Workman says he voted to remove Common Core, but it's more complicated than that
","State Rep. Ritch Workman is looking to win a Florida Senate seat this fall, so he’s hoping to educate voters on his record of opposing Common Core. In an online campaign ad posted June 20, 2016, Workman said that eight years ago he ""promised to go to Tallahassee and cut taxes and shrink the size and scope of government."" He said he followed through, passing tax cuts, changes to government pensions and ethics reform. ""I also voted to remove Common Core from our schools,"" he said in the video. That statement riled up groups like Florida Parents Against Common Core, which accused Workman of ""misrepresenting the facts."" The group supports Workman’s opponent, Rep. Debbie Mayfield, who in 2013 sponsored a bill to repeal the standards. That bill never got out of committee. But Workman told us he is telling the truth. We wanted to find out whether Workman voted to get rid of Common Core standards in Florida. A common history lesson Common Core is a set of voluntary, state-based standards developed by the Council of Chief State School Officers and the National Governors Association. Created with input from teachers, parents and education experts, Common Core’s goal was to make an education in one state comparable with the education in another. The final guidelines for math and English came out in 2010, and states could then decide whether to use them. Forty-five states, including Florida, voluntarily decided to accept the standards. Like most states, Florida was good with the plan at first, and the state Board of Education adopted Common Core in 2010. But critics of Common Core attacked it as a federal takeover of education, and support for the guidelines waned. Workman describes it on his Senate campaign website as ""the federal government’s effort to nationalize our public schools."" But this fairly common misperception isn’t accurate. Washington is not in charge of creating or implementing the benchmarks, the states are — and they are free to change or abandon the standards as they see fit. What the federal government has done is encourage state standards and offer some grant money to aid the process. Florida, for example, won a $700 million federal grant for that purpose. That support has aroused suspicion among detractors. Florida’s method of dealing with the backlash, meanwhile, has been complex. Gov. Rick Scott initially supported Common Core, but in 2013 he ordered Florida to pull out of a consortium of states that were working together to create a new test they all would share to track progress. Eventually, the state chose to develop its own replacement to the Florida Comprehensive Assessment Test, or FCAT. Scott also called for public hearings that led state education officials in 2014 to recommend 98 changes to the benchmarks. Those proposed changes included things like 52 new calculus goals, guidelines for subjects beyond math and English, and a cursive writing requirement. The revisions were enough for the Florida Department of Education to consider the new guidelines separate from Common Core. Policy experts we talked to said they were more like extensions of the original standards. ""The resulting standards as we see them are closely aligned to the Common Core and high-quality (College and Career Readiness) standards in general,"" said Alyssa Schwenk, a spokeswoman at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute, which works to reform education. The state Board of Education approved the revisions unanimously in February 2014 and renamed them the Florida Standards. So what, if anything, did Workman have to do with kicking Common Core out of class? A different standard Workman told us the votes he mentioned came during the legislative session after Scott’s intervention and the education department’s changes, which Workman said he supported. In April 2014, lawmakers passed HB 7031, a broad education bill that removed more than 30 mentions of the term ""Common Core"" from the books as the Department of Education adopted the Florida Standards. That bill passed the House and Senate unanimously. Workman also voted for SB 1642, which froze sanctions based on school grading for a year, while the FCAT replacement (eventually known as the Florida Standards Assessment) was created. ""Those two bills repealed Common Core from the DOE's education policy,"" Workman told us in an email. Keep in mind, the Florida Standards had already been adopted at this point. The Legislature didn’t decide to revise the guidelines, the Board of Education did. While Workman may have opposed Common Core, the provisions he’s touting as his votes to remove the benchmarks were largely procedural after the change had already been made. So does that mean Common Core is out of Florida schools entirely? The name is certainly gone — ""Common Core is out,"" Scott said in a 2014 interview — and the state says as much. ""My understanding is that Florida is no longer a participating state,"" Florida Department of Education spokeswoman Cheryl Etters told PolitiFact Florida. But the Common Core State Standards Initiative still lists Florida as a Common Core state. Olympia Meola, a spokeswoman for the Council of Chief State School Officers, told us the map showing those states on the initiative’s website lists both ""states that have adopted the standards without any changes and those that have built upon and updated the Common Core State Standards to further fit their state’s unique context and priorities."" ""It is common practice for states to revise their academic standards periodically, and, in doing so, to build upon previously adopted standards,"" Meola said. That’s what Florida did by adopting the Florida Standards. Blair Mann, spokeswoman for the pro-Common Core nonprofit Collaborative for Student Success, noted ""the standards are still remarkably similar, and considered comparable to, the Common Core State Standards that other states are implementing."" So while the term ""Common Core"" is gone, the bones of the standards remain. That means it’s not quite accurate to say Common Core is gone. A better term may be to say it has evolved. Many critics of the Florida Standards agree, saying the new standards didn’t go far enough, and were essentially based on Common Core guidelines with ""cosmetic changes.""   That makes it difficult for Workman to make the claim he did, according to Abigail Swisher, an analyst at the New America Foundation’s Education Policy Program. ""Given that Florida is still designated a Common Core State, it would appear contradictory for any one person to claim that they have ‘removed’ the Common Core in that state,"" she said. Our ruling Workman said he ""voted to remove Common Core from our schools."" Workman did vote to literally remove the term ""Common Core"" from state records as Florida switched over to the revised Florida Standards. Indeed, the broad education bill that made it law was voted for unanimously. But that was only after the Board of Education, and not the Legislature, agreed to revise the Common Core standards. Workman’s vote did not affect the decision to make that change. Furthermore, the new benchmarks were largely additions to the original standards, so it’s difficult to definitively say Common Core is out of schools. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097092D00>],/factchecks/2016/jul/11/ritch-workman/workman-voted-remove-common-core/
"['History', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan claims the US is the 'oldest democracy' in the world. Is he right?
","When Democratic lawmakers staged a sit-in on the House floor calling for legislative action on gun control, Speaker of the House Paul Ryan was unamused. Clearly frustrated at the behavior, Ryan called the sit-in a political stunt and adjourned the House for recess for the Fourth of July holiday.   Once back in Wisconsin, Ryan appeared June 26, 2016 on Mike Gousha’s ""Upfront"" show on WISN TV. Gousha asked about the House Democrats, noting they said they felt like they weren’t being heard. ""We heard them plenty,"" Ryan said. ""You did hear them,"" Gousha said. ""And your reaction was you’re worried about the decorum in the House. They’re talking about maybe doing more of this sort of thing when you return from recess on July 5. Are you going to handle it the same way?"" ""No, we’re not going to handle it the same way,"" Ryan said. ""What would you do differently?,"" Gousha asked. ""Well, we’re working on that,"" Ryan said. ""We will not take this. We will not tolerate this. This is the oldest deliberative body in the world. We are the oldest democracy. And we have rules of decorum so that we can peacefully settle our issues and actually have democracy."" Having just celebrated our nation’s independence from England, we thought the time was right to take a look at whether the United States is ""the oldest democracy"" in the world. U.S. founding documents The Greeks first coined the term democracy to describe self rule. The term derives from the Greek word ""demos,"" meaning people. The city states of Ancient Greece, most notably Athens, ruled themselves. Many historians also consider the Roman Republic a type of democracy. But both of those empires have long since fallen and, of course, are no longer in the running to be ""the oldest democracy."" The United States declared its independence from England on July 4, 1776. After a brief period governed by the Articles of Confederation, the founding fathers drafted a new, governing document establishing our government as it operates today. The U.S. Constitution was ratified in 1788. PolitiFact National checked a claim on the Constitution in 2011 when former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman, a Republican, said the United States has ""the longest surviving constitution."" Defining a constitution as a single governing document, the claim was rated Mostly True. The U.S. constitution is the oldest single governing document, though other countries are governed by multiple documents older than our constitution. The Massachusetts state constitution is older, ratified in 1780, and served as a model for the authors of the U.S. Constitution. Ryan’s team sent us to that factcheck as backup for his statement that the U.S. is ""the oldest democracy."" ""That founding document established our democracy,"" said Ian Martorana, Ryan’s press secretary. ""It stands to reason that if America has the oldest constitution (that founded the democracy in question), then America also has the oldest democracy."" With that in mind, we turned to the history books. Democracy vs. republic The founding fathers feared direct democracy, which involves people deciding directly on policy initiatives and regarded it as an ill-advised form of government. They feared tyranny of the majority as much as that of a king. Instead, they created what is typically referred to as a representative democracy or republic -- the people elect leaders who make decisions on their behalf with a system that protected minority rights. Over the years, the differences between democracies -- both representative and direct -- and republics have been hotly debated by political scholars. For our purposes, we will broadly consider a democratic state to be one in which power is vested in the people who rule themselves or are governed by those who they elect. No matter the rhetoric, the United States has been governed by representatives elected by the people since it began. And few, if any, disagree that it marked a new approach. Sean Wilentz, professor of American History at Princeton, said when this type of government emerged in the United States the monarchists and aristocrats of the old world in Europe hated it. ""It was radical and revolutionary,"" he said. ""It was the opposite of the formal rule of the rich and well-born."" Voting rights Today, we consider democratic states to be ones with universal suffrage. That is, voting rights that are extended to all citizens without restrictions based on gender, race, religion or wealth. Voting eligibility is established through a combination of the U.S. Constitution and state laws. Nearly all citizens over age 18 can vote with some exceptions, such as people in prison on felony charges. The constitution, as originally written, did not establish who would be able to vote. So, states determined for themselves who could cast ballots. In the late 1700s, the only people who were able to vote for government officials were white, male property owners. Over time, more and more groups were granted the right to vote. The 15th Amendment to the Constitution, ratified in 1879, granted African American men the right to vote. The amendment declared the ""right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude."" Due to the use of poll taxes, literacy tests and other barriers, the right would not be fully realized until the Voting Rights Act of 1965 was passed.   Similarly, women were barred from voting until the 19th Amendment was ratified in 1920. New Zealand became the first self-governing nation to allow all women citizens to vote in 1893. Some scholars argue that the restricted electorate made the United States undemocratic at its founding. The problems with voting enfranchisement in the United States were also issues in other early democracies. Alex Keyssar, a professor of history and social policy at Harvard said the United States truly started to become democratic when the country began to be ruled by more of the population. ""There is something misleading about making claims that a country which permitted only adult white men to vote was a democracy,"" he said. ""It’s hard to argue that we were a democracy while slavery existed or while African Americans were denied the franchise."" No one could reasonably argue that the United States was democratic for all of its people from the beginning, but neither were other nations across the globe. Indeed, the writers of the U.S. constitution included a process for the citizens themselves to amend it over time. So, a democracy starting elsewhere in the world today would look different than the United States did when it began, but so does today's United States. And, whatever the debates of today, Wilentz noted that ""people called it democracy"" in the United States from the very beginning, and considered it a government led by the citizens rather than a ruler or ruling class. World comparison When it comes to textbooks, a typical narrative on democracy includes the examples from ancient times, then skips ahead to the United States and other European examples. Elements of democracy were introduced in other countries and localities prior to 1776. For example, San Marino, a small enclave surrounded by Italy and founded in the fourth century, claims to be the first republic. Its political system --  a parliamentary republic -- was established in a series of six books that date back to the late 1500s. But it isn't a nation and it hasn’t always been independent, coming under the authority of others. While England has a monarch as head of state, it has gradually evolved to function like a parliamentary republic. The Magna Carta of the 13th Century started to lay the groundwork for British parliament, but the Americans of 1776 clearly stated their view that the king was a despot aiming to establish an ""absolute Tyranny over these states."" And he did attempt to crush them with his armed forces. Our rating Ryan said the United States is ""the oldest democracy."" Our democracy is imperfect and always evolving, but that’s the nature of democracy. The changes, for better or worse, reflect the will of the people. While the United States is not the first to include elements of democracy, it is the oldest existing nation with a constitutional government in which the people elect their own government and representatives. We rate the claim True. (Editor's note: This item was posted, briefly, on July 1 with a rating of Mostly True. Our work as a judging panel continued past that point, so it was temporarily taken down and now is re-posted with a final rating of True). https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/e3108d84-0318-4f6d-a9ed-7d68e4c765db",[<zip object at 0x000002809A457F80>],/factchecks/2016/jul/11/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-claims-us-oldest-democracy-world-he-righ/

Mark Warner says Donald Trump has 'bankrupt four separate businesses'
","U.S. Sen. Mark Warner says presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has a ""lot of ammunition"" to fire at Donald Trump’s business record. ""To think that Mr. Trump is trying to lay out this proposition that he’s a successful business guy. He’s failed miserably, bankrupt four separate businesses,"" Warner, D-Va., said during a June 21 interview on CNN. We looked at Warner’s contention that Trump bankrupted four businesses. Clinton has made similar charges against the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, including on July 6 when she spoke in front of the shuttered Trump Plaza Casino and Hotel in Atlantic City, N.J.. Earlier this year, many of Trump’s GOP primary opponents also accused him of running businesses into the ground. Kevin Hall, Warner’s communications director, sent us a series of media reports about Trump’s business problems. Some Trump companies indeed have sought protection under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law, which shields businesses from creditors as as they reorganize with hope of remaining open. Under court supervision, the companies devise a plan to pay back some of its liabilities over time. That’s different from a Chapter 7 filing, which involves liquidating a company’s assets and distributing the proceeds to creditors. PolitiFact National has explored several claims about Trump’s business record and has tallied a list of bankruptcies for his companies. Let’s take a look. 1991 bankruptcy Trump’s first bankruptcy came when he sought protection for the Trump Taj Mahal in Atlantic City. Trump funded most of the casino’s $1 billion construction by using junk bonds with high interest rates, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. When it sought Chapter 11 protection a year after its opening, the casino had about $3 billion in debt. As part of the restructuring, Trump cut his ownership stake in the Taj Mahal by half and sold his airline as well as his personal 282-foot yacht, The Washington Post said in an August 2015 story. 1992 bankruptcies Two more of Trump’s Atlantic City casinos - the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino - sought Chapter 11 protection amid heavy debt and cash flow problems, United Press International reported at the time. A fourth bankruptcy also occurred in 1992 when Trump sought protection for The Plaza hotel in midtown Manhattan. The hotel, which Trump bought for $390 million in 1988, had accumulated more than $550 million in debt.  Trump gave up a 49 percent ownership stake and remained CEO, although he had little control over the day-to-day operations of the company, according to The New York Times. Most recent bankruptcies Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts filed for bankruptcy in 2004 when his casinos - including the Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Marina and Trump Plaza in Atlantic City, and a riverboat casino in Indiana - amassed an estimated $1.8 billion in debt, according to The Associated Press. Trump agreed to reduce his share in the company from 47 percent to 27 percent in a restructuring plan, but he still was the company’s largest single shareholder and remained in charge of its operations. Several years later, Trump Entertainment Resorts - formerly Trump Hotels and Casinos Resorts - was slammed by the Great Recession and missed a $53.1 million interest payment in December 2008, according to ABC News. The company declared Chapter 11 in February 2009. After negotiating with the board of directors, Trump resigned as the company’s chairman and had his corporate stake in the company reduced to 10 percent. The company continued to use Trump’s name in licensing. All told, the record shows that three of Trump’s Atlantic City casinos as well as The Plaza hotel went bankrupt in the 1990s. His overall casino and resort company went bankrupt twice in the 2000s while operating under different names. So you could argue that five Trump companies have gone into bankruptcy. Beyond the numbers The next question: Is Trump personally to blame for driving these ventures into bankruptcy, as Warner’s statement says? Trump defends his use of bankruptcy laws, saying they’ve allowed him to keep businesses afloat and that he’s rarely relied on them during a career of making hundreds of business deals. In a statement released the day Clinton made her Atlantic City trip, Trump pegged the number of bankruptcies at four.   ""It is an effective and commonly used practice in business to use bankruptcy proceedings to restructure a business and ultimately save jobs,"" Trump said in a July 6 statement.   Experts told PolitiFact National last September that Trump has had a high number of bankruptcies. But they didn’t entirely blame him for the Chapter 11 filings and noted that most occurred in the gambling industry, which has struggled. A 1991 article by United Press International about the financial woes of the Trump Castle and Trump Plaza and Casino said the Atlantic City gaming industry was ""depressed"" and that nine of the city’s 12 casinos saw declining revenues in 1990, with those two Trump casinos seeing the biggest revenue losses. The New York Times noted in a story earlier this month that Trump’s share of the overall Atlantic City casino market started to fall in 1997, and that while revenues for non-Trump gaming ventures in the city rose over the following five years, revenue at Trump casinos declined. Trump told the newspaper that his casinos ran into trouble because they began competing against each other - a statement that The Times said was ""a tacit acknowledgement that he overbuilt."" Roger Gros, publisher of Global Gaming Business magazine, told the Los Angeles Times last year that Trump put his Atlantic City casinos ""in so much debt that subsequent managers couldn't manage them properly."" But Michael Viscount, an Atlantic City lawyer who represented unsecured creditors during the 2004 Chapter 11 filing of the Trump Hotels and Casino resorts, doesn’t blame Trump for the bankruptcies. He told Forbes magazine in 2011 that he didn’t blame Trump for his Atlantic City casino bankruptcies. Viscount said creditors knew what they were getting into when they lent Trump money. ""They’ve all played this game before, in the insolvency space. The company that possessed his name filed bankruptcy because it was overleveraged,"" Viscount told Forbes. ""What does that tell you? People want to lend him money. He does grandiose things with it."" Adam Levitin, a law professor at Georgetown University, said in an August 2015 post on a blog dedicated to bankruptcy and credit issues that a Chapter 11 filing alone doesn’t demonstrate a lack of business acumen. Sometimes businesses go bankrupt because of poor management, but sometimes it’s because of factors beyond their control, Levitin wrote. ""And indeed, how much, if at all, was Trump involved in the management of the companies?"" Levitin wrote. ""I wouldn't be shocked if he was basically licensing his name."" Levitin told PolitiFact National last September that it’s not fair to put all the blame on Trump for his company’s bankruptcies because he’s acted as any investor would. Investors often own many non-integrated companies, which they fund by taking on debt, and some of them inevitably file for bankruptcy, Levitin said. ""The only difference is that Trump puts his name on his companies, which means people associate them with him, but he's not at all the leader in the bankruptcy space,"" Levitin said. ""These bankruptcies were not defining moments for Trump and shouldn't color our view of him."" Our ruling Warner said Trump has ""bankrupt four separate businesses."" The number, if anything, is conservative. We count five. But beyond the number, Warner’s statement also asserts that Trump was the cause of the bankruptcies, and that’s harder to parse out. There’s no doubt he had a role in many of the failings, having larded his casino operations with huge debts. But analysts note that Trump wasn’t acting alone; he had willing investors who put up big sums of money in the risky gaming industry. There’s also questions about how involved he was in running all of the casinos that bore his name. So on the whole, we rate Warner’s statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096894FC0>],/factchecks/2016/jul/11/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-donald-trump-has-bankrupt-four-se/
"['National', 'Crime', 'Cory Booker']","
How the war on drugs affected incarceration rates
","To address racial tensions in the United States, the federal government should invest in law enforcement, said Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., on NBC’s Meet the Press July 10. But it has to be the right kind of investment. ""There is a challenge with America where we have invested, unfortunately, in a war on drugs, which has been profoundly painful to our nation, with a 500 percent increase in incarceration in our country, disproportionately affecting poor and disproportionately affecting minorities,"" Booker said. President Richard Nixon launched the war on drugs in the early 1970s, and about 10 years later President Ronald Reagan strengthened the effort. We decided to look into Booker’s claim that these stricter drug policies led to a 500 percent increase in incarceration. We found that the number of people incarcerated for drug-related offenses has increased dramatically in the past 40 years, as has the overall incarcerated population. But it’s hard to prove a causal relationship. Rising incarcerated populations A spokesman said Booker’s statistic comes from the Sentencing Project, a criminal justice reform advocacy organization. It says the current incarcerated population is 2.2 million — including federal prisons, state prisons and local jails — which is a 500 percent growth over the past 40 years. Experts told us that the Sentencing Project’s statistics are credible. The state and federal prison population grew from 218,466 in 1974 to 1,508,636 in 2014, which is a nearly 600 percent increase. For comparison, the overall United States population has increased just 51 percent since 1974.  The state and federal prison population remained fairly stable through the early 1970s, until the war on drugs began. Since then, it has increased sharply every year, particularly when Reagan expanded the policy effort in the 1980s, until about 2010. So it seems Booker has his numbers right, but how much of this increase is a direct result of the tougher drug laws? The effort resulted in the Drug Enforcement Administration's establishment, as well as policies such as mandatory minimum sentences for drug crimes and new asset forfeiture rules. It’s hard to say exactly how much of the increase can be attributed to these policies because it’s difficult to isolate the impact to any one cause, experts told us. That being said, ""a lot of people attribute the increase in incarceration to the war on drugs,"" said Nancy La Vigne, director of the Urban Institute’s Justice Policy Center. ""While it's much more complicated than that, I suppose most would agree that it was the single biggest driver."" In 1980, about 41,000 people were incarcerated for drug crimes, according to the Sentencing Project. In 2014, that number was about 488,400 — a 1,000 percent increase. More people are admitted to prisons for drug crimes each year than either violent or property crimes, found Jonathan Rothwell, a senior economist at Gallup. So drug prosecution is a big part of the mass incarceration story, he said. Rothwell told PolitiFact he thinks some of the increase would have happened regardless, but Booker is right to focus on the drug war. Others see it differently. John F. Pfaff, a professor at Fordham Law School, has argued that the impact of the war on drugs is greatly exaggerated, finding that drug crime only accounts for about 20 percent of prison growth since 1980. ""In reality, a majority of prison growth has come from locking up violent offenders, and a large majority of those admitted to prison never serve time for a drug charge, at least not as their primary charge,"" he wrote last year. But violent crime and seemingly unrelated factors that contributed to the rapid increase in prison population growth can actually be connected to the war on drugs, said Steven Duke, a professor at the Yale Law School. For example, if policies cause the cost of drugs to go up, users might be more prone to steal in order to afford drugs. And black markets can lead to more violent crime, like if a drug deal goes sour and results in a murder. Effect on minorities and poor people It is a well-established fact that minorities are overrepresented in the prison population. About 58 percent of all sentenced inmates in 2013 were black or hispanic, yet the two groups make up just about 30 percent of the total population. Research also suggests that when black and white people engage in the same illegal activity and have the same criminal history, black people are more likely to be arrested, more likely to face tougher charges and more likely to receive longer sentences than whites. In a 2014 article, Rothwell found that the war on drugs has significantly impacted black people. He found that white people are more likely than black people to sell drugs and about as likely to consume them. Even so, black people are 3.6 times more likely than white people to be arrested for selling drugs and 2.5 times more for drug possession. The question of how poor people are represented in the prison population, particularly among those incarcerated for drug-related offenses, is a little more elusive. The best data about prisoners’ income before their arrest comes from a 2004 government survey. The Prison Policy Initiative analyzed the survey and ""found that incarcerated people had a median annual income of $19,185 prior to incarceration, which is 41 percent less than non-incarcerated people of similar ages."" This would indicate that the incarcerated population is disproportionately poor, but it does not shed light directly on the question of the war on drugs' impact on poorer populations. Our ruling Booker said the 40-year war on drugs led to ""a 500 percent increase in incarceration in our country, disproportionately affecting poor and disproportionately affecting minorities."" Booker has his numbers right, looking at incarcerated population growth over the past 40 years. It’s hard to conclusively attribute the rapid rise to the war on drugs, but many experts believe that it is a major factor, if not the primary factor. Minorities are disproportionately represented in the prison population, and some slightly dated research indicates poor people are, as well. Evidence seems to show that black people are more likely to be arrested for drug crime than white people, despite being equally likely to use and less likely to sell drugs.

How many police departments are in the United States?
","Is there a link between police killing people during routine patrols and the sheer number of police departments in the country? Former Philadelphia Police Commissioner Charles Ramsey argued that there is. A traffic stop for a broken taillight in Falcon Heights, Minn., left Philando Castile dead. Falcon Heights only has about 5,500 residents and contracts its police service from the not much larger city of St. Anthony, population about 8,500. Ramsey, co-chair of a recent presidential policing task force, teased out the connections between law enforcement and race with Meet the Press host Chuck Todd on July 10, 2016. Todd said major urban police departments have been taking steps to ease racial tensions and asked Ramsey if the smaller departments had the same kind of resources. Ramsey painted a picture that went well beyond core funding. ""There are approximately 18,000 departments in the United States,"" Ramsey said. ""I would try to cut the number in half in the next 10 years or so, because you're always going to have these kinds of issues as long as you have this many departments with different policies, procedures, training and the like."" The numbers back Ramsey up on the number of departments. The final report from the task force he led said there are 17,985 U.S. police agencies. But that includes everything from college campus patrols, to sheriffs, to local police, to federal agents. For strictly local law enforcement, police and sheriff departments with armed officers, the total is closer to 15,400, according to the latest report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics. Those are the kinds of departments involved in some of the more prominent deadly encounters with police in the past few years. Still, 15,400 is a big number, and half of those departments have fewer than 10 officers. These smaller units face some real challenges. David Weisburd, executive director of the Center for Evidence-based Crime Policy at George Mason University, said while some do fine work, the quality ranges widely. ""There is little consistency in training or procedures across them,"" Weisburd said. ""There are many departments that simply poorly train and lead their officers."" Turnover is a common complaint. The police chief in Canon City, Colo., wrote in a 2013 article that the combination of rising suburban crime and limited budgets meant ""agency personnel are stretched in many cases beyond the breaking point, making retention of quality personnel increasingly challenging."" The biggest urban agencies demand more education for their officers. About 30 percent of the very largest departments require at least a two-year college degree. In the smallest communities, only 10 percent do. The shooting death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., produced a scathing report on the dangers that come when each small town boasts its own police department. Community leaders invited the Police Executive Research Forum, a leading national policy group, to take a look at the issues with the policing system across the wider St. Louis area. The report said fragmentation led to unprofessionalism and widespread mistrust of the police. About a third of the departments served territories of less than one square mile. Inefficiency was rife, and ""just one-quarter of the police departments in St. Louis City and County are accredited by the Commission on Accreditation for Law Enforcement Agencies."" The task force Ramsey co-chaired highlighted the testimony of criminologist Lawrence Sherman, who said ""so many problems of organizational quality control are made worse by the tiny size of most local police agencies."" Our ruling Ramsey said that the country has about 18,000 departments that conduct some sort of policing. In the broadest sense, that is accurate. If you include every college campus security department, tribal land unit, sheriff office, local police department, state police, and every federal agency, you get to 17,985. In terms of the most common local law enforcement agencies, that is sheriff and local police departments, the number is about 15,400. These are the ones where the issue of deadly encounters between police and citizens is front and center. Ramsey was making the case that when it comes to policing, small often is not beautiful, and plenty of evidence backs that up. But for the problem facing the country, the smaller number is most applicable. We rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A452040>],/factchecks/2016/jul/10/charles-ramsey/how-many-police-departments-are-us/

Donald Trump set the record for the most GOP primary votes ever. But that's not his only record
","They say the third time’s the charm. For Donald Trump, his third claim about a historic showing in the GOP primary finally hit the mark. First, he jumped the gun. Next, he exaggerated his margin of victory. But in a speech in Raleigh on July 5, Trump accurately described his historic accomplishment. ""We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party,"" he said, speaking just of the primary elections – since, of course, the general election hasn’t happened yet. How did Trump avoid some of the pitfalls he has made in the past with this unexpectedly tricky claim? In April, he claimed he had received the most votes of any Republican nominee ever. PolitiFact rated that False, because he had not received the most votes ever. However, as the article noted, Trump did have the chance to reach that milestone with strong showings in some upcoming primaries. Then on June 1, Trump said he had broken the record by millions of votes. PolitiFact rated that statement False as well. Trump had finally broken the record, but only by a small amount. ""Had Trump made a correct claim in one breath only to mangle the truth in the next?"" we asked. Yes, he had. But he finally got it right by avoiding any embellishment, and just sticking to the claim of a record-breaking victory. According to Real Clear Politics, Trump received about 13.3 million votes during the primary. That’s about 1.8 million votes more than the previous record, held by George W. Bush. Basking in the record On Tuesday, Trump spoke about winning in face of a crowded primary field and a ""rigged system,"" then name-dropped some GOP elders whose vote totals he eclipsed. ""Not only did the Republican party go way up from what it was four years ago – way, way up – but Donald Trump, in the history of the primary system, Republican Party, with 17 people running – a lot of people don’t understand, when you say 17 people – I got almost 14 million votes,"" Trump said. ""More than anybody in the history of the Republican Party. More than Ronald Reagan. More than the Bushes. More than Richard Nixon. More than Dwight D. Eisenhower, who did win the second World War; it certainly helped a heck of a lot."" ""We got the highest vote count in the history of the Republican Party,"" he continued. ""It was such a big thing for me. We won 37 states. We got stronger and stronger and stronger."" A less dubious record But does his record mean that Trump is the most popular Republican candidate ever? No. What Trump didn’t mention was that during this primary, most Republican voters cast a ballot for someone other than him. More than 16 million people cast votes for another candidate, according to a Washington Post analysis. To be fair, Trump was facing a crowded primary field, which he mentioned in his speech. But 13 of his 16 challengers didn’t make much of a splash. The top three challengers, however – Ted Cruz, John Kasich and Marco Rubio, in that order – combined to receive more than 15 million votes. So Trump now holds two GOP primary records: most votes for, and most votes against. Previously, John McCain was the holder of the most-votes-against record. As the national convention approaches, it’s also worth noting that Trump isn’t the only GOP frontrunner to have received less than half of his party’s votes in the primary, but he is one of just a few. The nomination results in past cases have been a mixed bag. McCain won the nomination in 2008 despite receiving less than half the votes, as did Barry Goldwater in 1964. But the frontrunners in 1968 (Ronald Reagan) and 1952 (Robert Taft) went into the convention with less than 50 percent of the primary votes and ended up losing the nomination. Finally, it’s worth noting that some historical comparisons of vote totals and percentages are hardly apples-to-apples. The current primary system is a relatively new process. As one political scientist previously told PolitiFact, ""Before the 1970s, candidates often did not run in many primaries and caucuses to win delegates"" because party leaders had more influence than they do now, and national conventions were typically contested no matter what. Our ruling Trump said he got the most votes in the history of the Republican Party primary system. That’s accurate. He received 13.3 million votes, beating George W. Bush’s record of 11.5 million votes. Yet what Trump failed to mention is that he also holds the record for the most votes cast against a primary candidate, and that he’s one of only a few Republican frontrunners in modern history to have been supported by less than half of the party’s primary voters. Because Trump’s claim was accurate but missing that context, we rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/be10f613-3754-43fd-9d02-e89f00619253",[<zip object at 0x000002809C3DE700>],/factchecks/2016/jul/08/donald-trump/donald-trump-set-record-most-gop-primary-votes-eve/

Hillary Clinton: Donald Trump wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage
","In her speech in Charlotte on Tuesday, Hillary Clinton slammed Donald Trump’s economic platform. Specifically, Clinton said, the Republican presidential nominee doesn’t want the U.S. government to guarantee that workers get a minimum wage. ""Donald Trump thinks wages are too high,"" Clinton said. ""He actually stood on the debate stage and said that. And he wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage altogether. Well, I think anyone who is willing to work hard should be able to find a job that pays well enough to raise a family. So we’re going to increase the federal minimum wage and give the middle class a raise."" The Charlotte crowd cheered loudly for Clinton’s promise of a higher minimum wage, and it might not have just been because they were supporters. A report released earlier this year by North Carolina non-profit MDC, which is focused on poverty and social justice issues, said that of the 100 largest metro areas in the country, Charlotte ranks 97th for upward mobility. It defined upward mobility as a child born into a low-income family eventually moving into the middle or upper class. In fact, the report said, four of the six worst metro areas in the country were in North Carolina – Charlotte, Greensboro, Raleigh and Fayetteville. Certainly a higher minimum wage would be popular to some, just as a lower minimum wage would be popular to others. We’re not here to debate what’s best, but rather to find out if Clinton’s description of Trump’s views are accurate. Trump’s stance As it turns out, Trump’s views on wages are all over the map. He did say at one Republican presidential debate that he thought wages are too high, but he has also later said that he doesn’t understand how people survive on the minimum wage of $7.25 an hour. PolitiFact has previously noted his scattered opinions on wages, in an article devoted to tracking his evolving positions on a half dozen topics. So we’ll look instead at the second part of Clinton’s attack. Did Trump really say the he wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage? Like his other comments on wages in general, Trump’s stance on the federal minimum wage is a bit complicated to parse. In May, he appeared on NBC’s Meet The Press, when host Chuck Todd attempted to pin him down on this very subject. Trump began by expressing sympathy for people working for the minimum wage, saying ""I have seen what's going on. And I don't know how people make it on $7.25 an hour."" He immediately pivoted, saying that while he would personally like to see a higher minimum wage, he also wouldn’t do anything if elected to make it reality. ""I would like to see an increase of some magnitude,"" Trump told Todd. ""But I'd rather leave it to the states. Let the states decide. Because don't forget, the states have to compete with each other."" Todd followed that up by asking if Trump thought the states should only be able to decide whether to raise their minimum wages from the $7.25 federally mandated minimum wage, or if there should be no federal minimum wage at all – giving states the option to go lower than $7.25 or have no minimum wage at all. ""But should the federal government set a floor?"" Todd asked. ""No,"" Trump replied. ""I'd rather have the states go out and do what they have to do."" Since that was now nearly two months ago, and Trump has been known to change his opinion on wages in the past, we reached out to his campaign to ask if he still believed that the federal government should not require a minimum wage. We did not hear back. Trump has also said that the minimum wage should be left up to the states in at least four other TV and radio interviews. Our ruling Hillary Clinton said Donald Trump ""wants to get rid of the federal minimum wage."" She is right. While Trump has said he personally thinks the minimum wage should be higher, he has also said that it should be up to the states and that the federal government should not set a nation-wide minimum wage at all. We rate this claim True.   https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/264c6117-44e5-4147-98cb-f1ebb47d86db",[<zip object at 0x000002809C1D0340>],/factchecks/2016/jul/08/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-donald-trump-wants-get-rid-federal/

Sweeping claim about safety of youth sports lacks evidence
","State lawmakers have been among those pushing the Cuomo administration to allow all high school sports to resume, even those the state deems ""higher risk"" such as wrestling, competitive cheerleading, basketball and hockey.  In a news conference on Jan. 14, Assemblymember Colin Schmitt, a Republican who represents parts of Orange and Rockland counties, said neighboring states have allowed students to play and New York should follow suit.  ""We have scientific data, from all different levels, but particularly from the high school sports levels, from numerous different states that shows that it is safe to play what New York is considering high-risk sports,"" he said.  Last week, the New York State Department of Health announced those sports will be allowed to return Feb. 1. Now the question has become even more important to a lot of families whose children may want to play: Is Schmitt right? Does scientific data show it is safe to play amid a pandemic?   We approached Schmitt’s office about his claim, and his chief of staff, Taylor Weyeneth, sent us information from several sources. He reiterated Schmitt’s statement that with Covid-19 safety measures in place, sports can resume without a high risk of transmission.  A news story from earlier this month dealt with rapid testing of student athletes in Michigan. The 4,000-plus students who played football and volleyball and competed in swimming competitions took a test before they practiced or competed. The state found 99.6% of the tests came back negative since testing began Dec. 30.    A University of Wisconsin study of Covid-19 and high school sports, published in October, was based on surveys of 207 high school athletic departments that had re-started sports. Those departments accounted for more than 30,000 students, 4,000 games and 16,000 practices during September. The sports included, but were not limited to, cheerleading, soccer and football. The survey showed 271 coronavirus cases reported among the students, with only one case traced back to school sports. The infection rate among high school student athletes was lower than the rate among the general population of their peers, the authors wrote.  We asked the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health about the study.  The school’s dean, Dr. Robert N. Golden, said in a statement that the study does not represent the views of the school, and he cautioned the data came from high school athletic departments and that the study had not been peer-reviewed.  ""High schools across the country are working to make the best decisions they can regarding the health and safety of their athletes, and we do not believe this report should play a major role in shaping their decisions,"" said Golden.  A survey in Kentucky tracked responses from more than 12,000 high school football players and support staff. The survey, conducted by football coaches and reported on by the Cincinnati Enquirer, found that less than 1% of participants reported being infected with the coronavirus after two months of meetings and practices. None of the cases could be traced back to workouts. Not everyone was tested. The data was collected in an effort to persuade state officials to resume play, according to the Enquirer. We asked experts about the risk of Covid-19 spread among high school athletes allowed to play amid the pandemic.  Dr. Chad Asplund, a primary care and sports medicine physician at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., said from what is known, the majority of the infections do not occur during games, but through everything that goes with them: meals, travel and hanging out with teammates. ""But from the data available, it appears that there has not been a significant amount of transmission during athletic contests,"" Asplund said.  As far as which sports are riskier, he said that those with more direct contact, such as wrestling, are more likely to transmit the virus between athletes, while outdoor sports are less likely. Indoor sports pose more risk, but some of that can be mitigated with improved ventilation and air flow. He also said spectators should be masked and socially distant, especially indoors in an enclosed space, such as a hockey rink.  Ice hockey, considered ""higher risk"" in New York, has been deemed the source of several clusters or outbreaks around the country, including in Minnesota, Massachusetts, New Hampshire and Maine. During an amateur indoor hockey game between adults in Florida, 13 were infected, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.   ""The indoor space and close contact between players during a hockey game increase infection risk for players and create potential for a superspreader event, especially with ongoing community COVID-19 transmission,"" CDC researchers wrote.  The American Academy of Pediatrics says ice hockey in particular ""carries a higher relative risk.""  Regarding all youth sports, the academy cautions that the number of players, the frequency and duration of contact, and whether students are playing outside or inside can influence whether infection will be transmitted during school sports.  ""Risk can be decreased but not eliminated by athletes, parents, coaches, and officials following safety protocols,"" according to the academy’s guidance from December.  Dr. Donald Milton, a professor of environmental health at the University of Maryland School of Public Health, studies Covid-19 transmission. While his lab hasn’t studied this specific question, he said safe sporting events are doable with rapid tests before practices and games, twice-weekly PCR testing, contact tracing, air filtration, and proper mask wearing.  Dr. Ingrid Ichesco, who specializes in pediatric sports medicine at Michigan Medicine C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, said there’s many benefits with sports from a physical and mental standpoint, and those benefits have to be weighed against the risks.  ""Obviously, anything where you’re in close proximity there’s a risk for Covid transmission,"" she said.  Schmitt said scientific data shows it’s safe to play all sports while following health and safety protocols, even those considered ""high risk.""  But the data that Schmitt provided did not address all of the high-risk sports. There are indications that participation in certain sports does not lead to greater transmission of the virus. And the University of Maryland professor we talked to said he believes high school students can play sports safely by following the right precautions. But the key word in Schmitt's statement is ""scientific."" Tallying survey results is not conclusive scientific evidence regarding all of the sports that Schmitt wanted to see resumed, such as wrestling and ice hockey.  Even the medical school dean at the University of Wisconsin advised against relying on a colleague's report because it wasn't peer reviewed and the data collection depended on the high schools. If Schmitt had said ""mounting evidence"" or ""early indications"" show playing high school sports is safe amid a pandemic, that would not have been false. But he said ""scientific data,"" which implies a more rigorous standard has been met. It hasn't. We rate Schmitt’s claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096891380>],/factchecks/2021/jan/26/colin-schmitt/sweeping-claim-about-safety-youth-sports-lacks-evi/

Pro-Trump lawyer falsely claims Biden is an ‘illegal president’
","Nearly a week after President Joe Biden was inaugurated, supporters of Donald Trump are still spreading conspiracy theories that he isn’t actually running the country. In a Jan. 25 interview with the conservative Patriotically Correct Radio Show, Lin Wood, a defamation lawyer, said Biden’s presidency is a sham. ""I believe, without having definitive proof, that the military is in charge of our country, and I believe they are in charge of our country because Joe Biden is an illegal president,"" he said. ""And I believe the military has evidence that establishes that fact."" Later in the video, Wood floats the theory that Biden has been signing blank pages or executive orders ""prepared for him by the people that control him."" The clip was published on Facebook and flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) Wood was banned from Twitter in early January after he promoted the Capitol insurrection and false claims about the results of the 2020 presidential election. He has also promoted the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory; Wood’s claims about ""little children being abused, molested, and sacrificed"" by ""leaders in our government"" were aired on the Patriotically Correct Radio Show before his appearance. We’ve previously fact-checked false statements from Wood about the 2020 election, as well as rumors about a military takeover of the federal government. So we wanted to take a look at this post, too. Biden is not an ""illegal president,"" and there is no evidence that the military is running the country. Biden’s election was legal, and followed the process spelled out in Article II of the Constitution. All 50 states and the District of Columbia have certified their election results, which Congress finalized on Jan. 7. Biden won 306 electoral votes, while Trump won 232. Since Biden got more than 270 electoral votes, he is the rightful president. Biden was duly sworn into office Jan. 20, after which he and first lady Jill Biden moved into the White House. Trump gave a farewell speech the same day. There is no credible evidence that voter fraud affected the election outcome. Here’s how we know that: Election officials in every state have said there was no sign of significant fraud during the voting process.  The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency called the election ""the most secure in American history."" The Justice Department said it uncovered no evidence of widespread fraud. Not one of the lawsuits from Trump and his allies offered evidence that voter fraud affected the election outcome. Before Inauguration Day, QAnon supporters said the military would take over the federal government instead of Biden becoming president. That did not come to pass, and the U.S. is not under a military dictatorship. We reached out to Wood for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. His statement is inaccurate and ridiculous.

Is the Paris Climate Agreement easier on China and India than on the US?
","President Joe Biden has been systematically undoing former President Donald Trump’s policies on climate change. Case in point — Trump took the United States out of the Paris Climate Agreement. On Biden’s first day, he signed paperwork to bring the United States back in. Under the Paris agreement, about 200 nations promised to set goals to cut their greenhouse gas emissions. Each nation decides for itself what its goal will be. The hope is that cumulatively, those reductions would limit global temperature increases to no more than 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott, who chairs the National Republican Senatorial Committee, criticized Biden’s move.     ""We have to stop joining deals that are bad for America,"" Scott said in a statement to the press. ""President Biden is throwing the U.S. back into the Paris Agreement just to appease his liberal friends. This deal does nothing to hold real polluters, like Communist China and India, accountable."" There’s debate over how well the agreement’s overall approach will meet the challenge of climate change. Here, we focus on Scott’s claim that the agreement puts the U.S. at a disadvantage because it does nothing to hold ""real"" polluters like China and India accountable.     Under the agreement, each country submits a set of greenhouse gas reduction targets called a Nationally Determined Contribution. Countries have been sending these to the United Nations since they launched the agreement in 2015, with new or updated goals due in 2020, and every five years after that. For example, in its 2016 plan, China said that by 2030, it would lower carbon dioxide emissions per unit of GDP by 60% to 65% compared with 2005 releases. So, while its emissions would rise as its economy grew, they wouldn’t rise as much as they would have if everything worked the way it did in 2005. China said it would aim for carbon dioxide emissions to peak in about 2030. India set a more modest goal of cutting emissions by 33% to 35% per unit of GDP by 2030. Both China and India had additional goals on their list.  Scott said the agreement has no way to hold nations accountable if they stray from meeting their goals. Benjamin Zycher, resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, said Scott has a point. ""The Nationally Determined Contributions are strictly voluntary,"" Zycher said. ""There is no enforcement mechanism."" Zycher is no fan of the Paris agreement. But even those who think it holds promise agree that it lacks teeth. ""There are no penalties other than naming and shaming if these pledges are too weak or are not fulfilled,"" said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. Countries are required to report their progress publicly. Law professor Daniel Bodansky at the Arizona State University College of Law said transparency matters, and those progress reports are not simply taken on faith. ""The agreement provides for both expert and peer review of these reports,"" Bodansky said. Holding to international norms is a form of pressure, Bodansky argued. Zycher countered that China is autocratic and can ignore domestic and international pressure more easily than the United States, Canada and Europe. Gerrard said Scott’s reference to China and India was misleading. ""It implies that China and India are subject to weaker requirements than the U.S.,"" Gerrard said. ""That is incorrect."" The agreement’s compliance rules might be weak, but they apply equally to all participating countries. The Biden administration will determine how ambitious the U.S. goals will be when it rejoins the agreement. At this point, we don’t know what those will be. Gerrard and Bodansky both fault Scott for calling China and India the ""real polluters."" The actual rankings are more complicated. As this chart shows, by one measure, China releases more carbon dioxide than the U.S. By another, the U.S. tops China.   ""The United States is the second biggest emitter of greenhouse gases in the world, and has higher per capita emissions than either China or India,"" Bodansky said. ""It is misleading to point the finger at China and India and label them as the real polluters."" By the yardstick of carbon dioxide releases relative to the size of the economy, the latest numbers come from 2016 World Bank data. China was at the top with 0.5 kilograms per dollar of GDP, with India and the U.S. tied at 0.3 kilograms per dollar of GDP.  We reached out to Scott’s office and did not hear back. Scott said the Paris Climate Agreement is bad for the United States because it fails to hold ""real polluters"" such as China and India accountable.  People who study the agreement agree that it lacks teeth to hold each country to its carbon dioxide reduction goals. But its rules apply equally to all nations. China and India are treated the same as the U.S.  China emits almost twice as much carbon dioxide as the U.S., but per person, the ranking is flipped, and the U.S. emits twice as much as China. By both standards, India emits much less than either country. The Paris agreement lacks strict enforcement, but Scott’s comparisons to China and India are misleading.

Gov. Tony Evers on the money with claim about increase to general school aid
","Gov. Tony Evers struck a somber tone with his State of the State address on Jan. 12, 2021, as he remembered the lives lost to COVID-19 and reflected on the myriad challenges of 2020.  But he also used part of his speech to touch on some of the state’s accomplishments before the pandemic killed thousands and forced many Wisconsin residents into unemployment.  Among them: Boosting funding for public schools.  ""We put $330 million in general school aids — the largest in more than a decade,"" Evers said. Is Evers on the money? Let’s dig in.  When asked for evidence to support the governor’s claim, spokeswoman Britt Cudaback cited breakdowns by the Legislative Fiscal Bureau that detail the changes to general school funding, or equalization aids, in each budget dating back to 2005-2007. (Reminder: Wisconsin operates on a two-year budget cycle.) General aid is the primary pot of money for school districts, separate from categorical spending for specific needs such as transportation or meals. To assess changes over time, the Fiscal Bureau compares funding in the current budget to the second year of the previous budget — also known as the base year.  According to an analysis of the 2019-2021 budget, that spending plan allocated an additional $329,942,000 — a 3.5% increase — for general school aid when compared to 2018-2019. So Evers had roughly the right number in his State of the State address.  But was that the biggest hike in more than a decade?  Here are the changes in school spending over the past 16 years as documented by the Fiscal Bureau: 2019-2021: increase of $329,942,000 (3.5%) 2017-2019: increase of $72,750,000 (0.8%) 2015-2017: increase of $108,137,500 (1.2%) 2013-2015: increase of $170,239,100 (2%) 2011-2013: decrease of $749,388,000 (8.1%) 2009-2011: decrease of $294,003,800 (3.1%) 2007-2009: increase of $76,756,000 (0.8%) 2005-2007: increase of $701,600,000 (8.1%) Evers is correct on that front, too. The 3.5% boost for 2019-2021 is easily the largest since the 2005-2007 budget, even when accounting for inflation. In his State of the State address, Evers said ""we put $330 million in general school aids — the largest in more than a decade."" The 2019-2021 budget increased general aid by 3.5% when compared to the previous year. That’s the biggest hike for that pot of money since the 2005-2007 budget.  We rate this claim True.    ",[<zip object at 0x00000280971B2C80>],/factchecks/2021/jan/26/tony-evers/gov-tony-evers-money-claim-about-increase-general-/

","President Joe Biden’s family Bible is the latest fodder for Illuminati conspiracy theorists. On Jan. 21, a Facebook user posted a photo of Biden’s hand on the Bible. First lady Jill Biden is pictured in the lower right-hand corner. ""Sooo has anyone else realized this yet or???? Masonic/Illuminati Bible that Biden swore on yesterday,"" the photo’s caption says. The post has more than 16,000 shares. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) The term ""Illuminati,"" translated from Latin to mean ""revealed"" or ""enlightened,"" refers to a secret society called the Bavarian Illuminati that sought to infiltrate powerful institutions, such as monarchies, to promote Enlightenment ideals. ""Masonic"" refers to freemasonry, the practices of the world’s oldest and largest fraternal organization. The Bavarian Illuminati infiltrated Masonic lodges before dissolving in the 18th century. The Bible that Biden was sworn in on is not related to either organization, which have been the subjects of numerous conspiracy theories. Other fact-checkers have debunked similar claims. Biden has used this hefty Bible, featuring a Celtic cross, throughout his career in public office. He told Stephen Colbert in December that it’s been a family heirloom since 1893. ""Every important date is in there,"" he said. ""For example, every time I’ve been sworn in for anything, the date has been on that and is inscribed in the Bible.""   The book is pictured in photos from when Biden was first sworn in as a senator in 1973. He also used it when he was inaugurated as vice president. (AP) As evidence that the Bible is linked to the Illuminati, the Facebook post includes two screenshots. The first screenshot shows a listing for a Haydock Douay-Rheims Bible, a 19th century translation with commentary from Christian scholar George Leo Haydock, on a third-party auction house website. The second screenshot shows text from a website that claims the Haydock Douay-Rheims book contains information about how the Illuminati ""changed the name of God the Son of the Catholic Trinity"" — a ""Masonic trick"" that the website calls ""the Da Vinci Code."" Biden’s family Bible is indeed a Haydock Douay-Rheims edition, which was common among English-speaking Catholics in the U.S. until the 1940s. But claims about this edition of the Bible being linked to Illuminati are related to a long line of conspiracy theories about the Illuminati, which only operated for a decade in the 1700s and sought to replace Christianity with a ""religion of reason."" ""Beginning in 1792, several conspiracy authors began to combine the Masons, the Illuminati, the Templars, and the Jews in varying combinations to create a worldwide conspiracy of universal control,"" wrote Christopher Hodapp and Alice Von Kannon in ""Conspiracy Theories and Secret Societies For Dummies."" ""The Da Vinci Code"" is a book about an elaborate conspiracy to suppress information that Jesus possibly had a child with Mary Magdalene. It is a work of historical fiction that has been discredited by churches, clergy members and Bible scholars. We could find no credible evidence that Biden’s Bible is linked to the Illuminati. While many former presidents were Freemasons, we did not find evidence that Biden is a member of the fraternity. The Facebook post is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!

No, Calif. Rep. Maxine Waters didn’t say Trump supporters ‘not welcome here’
","In the final days of Donald Trump’s presidency, a 2018 social media post resurfaced featuring one of Trump’s sharpest critics, California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters. The post shows two images of Waters, each overlaid with a quote attributed to her. The first: ""We’re sending a message to every Trump supporting American that you’re not welcome here."" The second: ""We must welcome everyone who crosses our borders, whether they are illegal or not."" A caption next to the image, which was shared 44,000 times, captures the irony of the supposed quotes: ""So actual Americans are unwelcome but illegals are welcome? Thanks for clearing that up."" However, neither quote is accurate. And while Waters did make statements suggesting Trump Cabinet members should be singled out in public, she did not direct her comments at Trump supporters broadly, as this post suggests. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In searches of Google and Nexis news archives, we found no evidence that Waters had uttered either quote.  But the post appears to allude to the Trump administration’s zero-tolerance policy on immigration, announced in April 2018. The policy led to the separation of nearly 3,000 children from their parents when families tried to enter the United States at the Mexico border without permission. We did find that on June 23, 2018, Waters made comments about Trump’s Cabinet members during a rally in Los Angeles. During the event, she demanded that children separated at the border be reunited with their parents. Her comments came one day after the owner of a restaurant in Lexington, Va., refused to serve then-White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders and asked her to leave, saying Sanders works in an ""inhumane and unethical"" administration. Waters said at the rally: ""We want the children back. We want them connected to their parents. We want it done now. We’re going to insist on it. If you think we’re rallying now, you ain’t seen nothing yet. Already you have members of your Cabinet that are being booed out of restaurants, who are — protesters taking up at their house, who are saying, ‘no peace, no sleep; no peace, no sleep.’"" She added:  ""And so, let’s stay the course. Let’s make sure we show up, wherever we have to show up. And if you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they’re not welcome anymore, anywhere. We’ve got to get the children connected to their parents."" A Facebook post says Waters said Trump supporters are ""not welcome here"" and that ""we must welcome everyone who crosses our borders.""  Neither quote is accurate. Waters did say that members of Trump’s Cabinet are ""not welcome anymore, anywhere"" in a June 2018 critique of the administration’s zero-tolerance immigration policy, one that led to the separation of children from their parents at the Mexico border. But she did not direct her comments at all Trump supporters as this post suggests.

Biden didn’t spark migrant caravan, question loyalty of US troops before taking office
","President Joe Biden had been in office only for a few hours when claims began to circulate about how he had already failed in his new role. ""It has been a terrible start for ‘the big guy,’"" Restoration PAC, a super PAC based in suburban Chicago, posted on Facebook on Jan. 20, following the late-morning presidential inauguration.  An accompanying image read: ""4 Biden failures before taking office: Sparked an immigration crisis — migrant caravan from Honduras is moving towards the US border; questioned the loyalty of US troops in Washington D.C.; invoked race during the U.S. Capitol riot — said BLM would be treated differently by police; calls for unity but goes along with the divisive impeachment.""  For this fact-check, we focused on the first two points. The latter two are accurate: Biden said Black Lives Matter protesters would have been treated differently than U.S. Capitol rioters were, and his assessment is supported by several examinations that compared police responses to summer protests for racial justice with the riot. And Biden supports the impeachment trial, which he has said he thinks the Senate can juggle with its usual business. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) As a super PAC, Restoration PAC has few limits on fundraising or spending to advocate for or against political candidates. In the 2020 election cycle, Restoration PAC spent $18.7 million on communications to oppose Democrats, and $1 million on communications supporting Republicans.  The claim that Biden ""sparked an immigration crisis"" draws a connection between his actions and a migrant caravan from Honduras that the Facebook post says ""is moving toward the U.S. border.""  The migrants were attempting to flee Honduras, beset for years by poverty and gang violence and now ravaged by COVID-19. The already desperate conditions in the country were worsened by two major hurricanes in November that left many people without jobs or homes. By the time the Facebook post was published, though, the caravan had already dissipated in Guatemala, stopped by roadblocks where Guatemalan forces used tear gas and batons to turn back the group of thousands. It is not uncommon for migration to occur around the time of U.S. elections and transitions of power, NBC News reported, citing spikes in late 2016, early 2017 and 2018 around the time of the midterm elections.  Opponents of Biden’s immigration plans have sought to link his proposals to the caravan’s movement. U.S. Rep Ken Buck, R-Colo., tweeted a video on Jan. 20 of the Honduran migrants clashing with Guatemalan soldiers, writing, ""This is what happens when you announce plans to grant amnesty to millions of illegal immigrants. Joe Biden’s open borders plan has consequences.""  But a Biden proposal to provide a route to citizenship for immigrants illegally in the country would apply only to people who were already in the U.S. as of Jan. 1, 2021, to deter migrants from moving toward the U.S. border.  The Facebook post’s claim that Biden ""questioned the loyalty of U.S. troops in Washington, D.C."" does not include examples or specifics.  It likely is related to the decision to vet all National Guard troops assigned to the city for the inauguration, after concerns about extremism and insider threats. PolitiFact did not find any published comments from Biden or his representatives about the vetting process or the loyalty of the National Guard. The screening resulted in 12 National Guard members being removed from inaugural duties. Two of them had made extremist statements about the event, the Associated Press reported. ""This type of vetting often takes place by law enforcement for significant security events,"" said Christopher Miller, the Acting Secretary of Defense under Trump, in a Jan. 18 statement. ""However, in this case the scope of military participation is unique.""  Regarding the scope, 25,000 members of the National Guard were deployed for Biden’s inauguration, compared with more than 7,000 for Trump’s 2017 inauguration.  The National Guard presence at inaugural events was beefed up following a Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, and the background checks were added after the discovery that ex-military members had participated in the riot. Nine of the people arrested for participating in the riot were former U.S. military members, ABC News reported. One of the five people who died as a result of the riot was a U.S. Air Force veteran shot by police as she climbed through a window near the House chamber. We contacted Restoration PAC for comment but did not receive a reply.  A Facebook post attacking Biden’s pre-presidential ""failures"" blamed him for a migrant caravan from Honduras and said he questioned the loyalty of U.S. troops in Washington.  Biden’s proposal to provide a route to citizenship for immigrants is only applicable to people who were already in the U.S. as of Jan. 1, 2021. The caravan that had been headed for the U.S. border disbanded. PolitiFact did not find any evidence that Biden questioned the loyalty of U.S. troops in Washington. The decision to vet the National Guard members deployed for the inauguration followed the discovery that ex-military members had participated in the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.

No, Democrats are not eliminating the right of Americans to call parents mom and dad
","In recent years, gender-neutral language has been a hot-button issue for many. Indeed, according to U.S. Rep. Glenn Grothman, R-Wisconsin, that debate has pushed America to this point:  ""A majority of Americans have voted for a party that … wants a world in which you cannot call your parents mom and dad."" Yes. There is a lot to unpack there. It begins with a new rules package adopted Jan. 4, 2021, by the Democratic-controlled House on a 217-206, party-line vote. The package covers many aspects of how the chamber will run in the new term. The rule in question applies specifically to official House documents, saying they must use gender-neutral language. For instance, documents will reference ""parents"" instead of ""mother and father""; ""child"" instead of ""son"" or ""daughter""; or ""chair"" instead of chairman. The phrase ""submit his or her resignation"" will be replaced with ""resign."" But in a news release that day, Grothman argued Democrats want to eliminate the words -- along with son, daughter, brother, sister, uncle, aunt and many more -- entirely.  As in, from everyday life.  Here is where we’d normally say: ""Oh, brother.""  But now we’re not sure we can. Let’s check it out. Grothman’s claim and framing of the issue falls short of reality. For starters, he suggests the rule aims to eliminate the words from everyday speech. In truth, they only apply to official House documents -- not statements by House members, let alone anyone else. In an interview with PolitiFact Wisconsin, Grothman argued that saying ""words like mother and father should not be used is absurd.""  But in his own news release, Grothman acknowledged the House rule changes are ""largely symbolic."" That undermines the very rhetoric he used in criticizing them.  The House rules note the change is meant ""to ensure we are inclusive of all Members, Delegates, Resident Commissioners and their families -- including those who are nonbinary.""  U.S. Rep. James P. McGovern, D-Massachusetts, chairman of the House Rules Committee, said: ""It’s mind-blowing that some people have found it controversial to say ‘parents’ instead of listing ‘mother and father.’ Only in Congress would it be a scandal to be succinct.""  Of course, that overstates things as well. The criticism from Grothman and others is not because Democrats want to be ""succinct."" And that’s not why Democrats made the change. House leaders have said they want to lead by example. As such, they are laying down a marker for how language should be used to reflect society today. ""From my standpoint, the gender-neutral language is just consistent with an effort for the House, in the best tradition of the House, to reflect the gorgeous mosaic of the American people in the most sensitive fashion possible,"" U.S. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, D-New York, said in a Jan. 5, 2021, LGBTQ Nation article.  Grothman claimed Democrats want ""a world in which you cannot call your parents mom and dad.""  Grothman has a small point, in that the new rules are laying down a marker for how Democrats in the House hope people will behave and treat others in general, not just in limited circumstances. Indeed, House leaders touted the fact they were leading by example.  But he dramatically overstates the impact, which he acknowledged in his news release is ""largely symbolic."" The rules do not apply to every day life, or constrain Grothman or anyone else from referring to their mother and father as, well, Mom and Dad. And that was the core of his claim. We rate his claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DFB040>],/factchecks/2021/jan/25/glenn-grothman/no-democrats-are-not-eliminating-right-americans-c/

No, Biden administration didn’t label Libertarians terrorists
","Jeremy ""Spike"" Cohen, the 2020 Libertarian Party vice presidential nominee, has sparked outrage against President Joe Biden on social media with claims that his administration labeled Libertarians terrorists. ""A silver lining to the Biden administration labeling Libertarians terrorists is that the CIA will probably start giving us money and weapons now,"" Cohen wrote in a Jan. 22 Facebook post. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that the Biden administration has labeled members of the Libertarian Party or people with libertarian views terrorists.  While Biden referred to the rioters who attacked the Capitol on Jan. 6 as ""domestic terrorists,"" he did not single out libertarians in the roughly 20-minute speech he delivered Jan. 7.  In his inaugural address, Biden singled out domestic terrorism and white surpremacy as threats the nation ""must confront"" and ""defeat."" He did not mention libertarians in that address or insinuate libertarians were terrorists. Cohen told PolitiFact that he based his post — which he described as ""pretty tongue-in-cheek"" — on a statement made by former CIA director John Brennan during an MSNBC interview.  Cohen claimed that Brennan, who served under President Barack Obama, said the new administration would be investigating domestic terrorists — including Libertarians. In another Facebook post, Cohen referred to the MSNBC video more directly.  ""It's been less than 24 hours into the new administration, and the former head of the CIA is already on national TV saying that the Biden administration will move with ‘laser-like focus’ on... libertarians,"" Cohen wrote.  But the video does not substantiate what Cohen claimed.  Here’s what Brennan said:  ""I know looking forward that the members of the Biden team, who have been nominated or have been appointed, are now moving in laser-like fashion to try to uncover as much as they can about what looks very similar to insurgency movements that we’ve seen overseas. Where they germinate in different parts of the country, and they gain strength, and it brings together an unholy alliance, frequently, of religious extremists, authoritarians, fascists, bigots, racists, nativists — even libertarians.""  Brennan did not say the Biden administration would target libertarians. Brennan does not hold a position within the Biden administration. Nick Shapiro, former deputy chief of staff to Brennan at the CIA, told PolitiFact that Brennan's comments in the interview referred to government efforts to find and charge people involved in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. ""He said 'even libertarians,' since many self-identified libertarians acknowledged their participation in the disgraceful events of 6 January. He was not referring to the Libertarian Party,"" Shapiro said. Cohen told PolitiFact that he did not have any proof that Biden himself had labeled Libertarians terrorists. Cohen claimed the Biden administration labeled Libertarians ""terrorists.""  There is no evidence of this.

Social media users push evidence-free claim that Joe Biden repeated instructions from earpiece
","Less than two hours before he was inaugurated, President Joe Biden arrived at the U.S. Capitol with Kamala Harris, his vice president. News organizations broadcast the scene as Biden, Harris and their spouses emerged from the motorcade, climbed the steps to the Capitol and walked through its doors at about 10:30 a.m. As Biden passed by a pair of U.S. Marines at the entryway, the wind picked up. Someone shouted a command. And Biden’s voice, through his mask, was picked up on the mics. It isn’t clear what Biden said. But that moment — a comment made in passing as Biden entered the Capitol — fueled an unsubstantiated online rumor.  The rumor: That Biden was using an earpiece to get through the day. Social media users sharing a clip of the scene claimed that Biden was told through his headset to salute the Marines on his way inside, as presidents customarily do. They said that he repeated the command out loud instead of actually offering a salute. ""Biden fails to salute the Marines, hears the headset remind him to salute them and says it aloud,"" read a caption on one YouTube video, which showed a snippet from C-Span’s live coverage of the Inauguration Day events. The caption was later removed. ""Someone in Biden's earpiece told him to salute the marines, and Biden just repeated the words ‘salute the marines,’ because he is so used to just repeating what comes from his earpiece,"" said a Twitter user who also shared the same clip from C-Span. Facebook posts sharing similar clips were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The White House did not respond to a request for comment. But the C-Span footage circulating as evidence of a Biden earpiece doesn’t actually prove what social media users claimed it does. There’s no indication from the clip that Biden was wearing an earpiece and taking orders through it. It’s not clear what he said, either.  Journalist Keith Olbermann, Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel and other social media users separately tweeted that they heard Biden say, ""Good looking Marines."" ""That’s a more reasonable explanation tha(n) ‘Biden had a secret earpiece yesterday, only once accidentally repeated his Deep State instructions, and a random guy noticed it,’"" Weigel, who often debunks manipulated media through his Twitter feed, wrote in a second tweet. PolitiFact reviewed C-Span’s footage and video of the same moment as shown by other other networks, such as PBS NewsHour. We found that Biden’s remarks were difficult to make out because of the wind and poor audio, and because he was wearing a mask. The burden of proof is on the speaker, however. The videos shared on YouTube and Twitter did not provide conclusive evidence that Biden was following instructions from an earpiece. We saw no credible reports that he was wearing one as he entered the Capitol, either.

No evidence lawmakers forced National Guard into parking garage
","Lawmakers from both parties expressed outrage after the National Guard members summoned to Washington to secure President Joe Biden’s inauguration were ordered to vacate the U.S. Capitol and take rest in nearby parking garages and outdoor areas. The National Guard members returned to the Capitol hours after they were ordered out, according to Politico. But as photographs showing the troops sprawled on the floor circulated on social media, so, too, did unsubstantiated rumors about who was responsible for pushing them out. One Facebook post sought to blame Biden and the Democratic Party. ""It’s absolutely DISGUSTING that the Democrats forced our GREAT troops to sleep on the ground of a PARKING garage after dragging them to DC for photo ops!"" the Jan. 21 Facebook post said. ""None of the troops even knew why they were there!"" The post and others like it were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There are conflicting statements about who requested the relocation, but the National Guard told PolitiFact that congressional members didn’t know about it. Politico reported that one National Guard unit resting in the Dirksen Senate Office building was abruptly told by Capitol Police to vacate on the night of Jan. 21. The unit ended up in a parking garage that lacked internet reception and had just one electrical outlet and one bathroom with two stalls. This was supposed to accommodate 5,000 troops, the article said. After offering up his office to the Guard, Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., tweeted around 10 p.m. that the situation was being resolved. Heinrich said the troops would be able to return to the Capitol complex that night. But who ordered the Guard members to vacate the Capitol in the first place? That’s where things get tricky. In a statement to Politico, Capitol Police spokesperson Eva Malecki said the department recently asked that troops’ shifts be reduced from 12 hours to eight. This was meant to allow for additional rest hours away from the Capitol complex. Politico and other outlets, including the Washington Post, reported Jan. 21 that the National Guard said the instruction to relocate came from the Capitol Police. But in another statement released the morning of Jan. 22, Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman said that with the exception of specific times on Inauguration Day, Capitol Police ""did not instruct the National Guard to vacate the Capitol Building facilities."" ""The Department is also working with the Guard to reduce the need for sleeping accommodations by establishing shorter shifts,"" Pittman said, ""and will ensure they have access to the comfortable accommodations they absolutely deserve when the need arises."" PolitiFact reached out to the Capitol Police for more information, but we did not hear back. The National Guard, however, said lawmakers had no knowledge of the relocations. ""Our understanding is that the unfortunate request for the National Guard to be relocated was made to the Capitol Police by a couple of staffers, without the knowledge of the congressional members,"" National Guard spokesperson Wayne Hall wrote in an email. Hall added that many lawmakers, like Heinrich, offered their offices and conference rooms to the troops after they found out about the situation.  The Capitol Police and National Guard released a joint statement Jan. 22 to address the confusion. It didn't clarify who made the initial request, but said the departments are working together to ensure on-duty troops could rest in Capitol facilities, and off-duty in hotels. ""The USCP and the National Guard have coordinated their efforts to ensure that National Guardsmen and women stationed throughout the Capitol Complex are in appropriate spaces within congressional buildings, including the U.S. Capitol, where they may take on-duty breaks. Off-duty troops are being housed in hotel rooms or other comfortable accommodations,"" it stated. Some Facebook posts making similar claims specified that it wasn’t just Democrats behind the relocations, but the Senate. But Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said he also didn’t know about the relocation until after it happened. ""It came to our attention last night that members of the National Guard, after standing on duty to protect the Capitol for Inauguration Day, keeping us safe, were sleeping in parking garages, in cramped quarters, without proper space or ventilation,"" Schumer said Jan. 22 on the Senate floor. ""It was utterly unacceptable. I have told those who run the security of the Capitol that it can never happen again. And I pledge to every National Guard member that it will not happen again."" Schumer added: ""The minute I heard about this outrage last night, we made sure it was fixed immediately. Every member of the guard was found proper accommodations inside and as of this morning, everyone was accounted for and taken care of. This morning, I went over to the CDC, and I spoke to a number of Guardsmen personally to make sure they were okay."" If this is true, it's outrageous.I will get to the bottom of this.https://t.co/CNBp055A91 Drew Hammill, a spokesperson for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Pelosi was also ""not involved in or aware of this deeply troubling matter until press reports."" The Facebook post also provided no evidence to support its claim that the over 26,000 National Guard members tasked with securing Biden’s inauguration were there ""for photo ops."" There is no indication that Democrats in Congress ""dragg(ed) them to DC"" for that reason. The National Guard deployed its troops to Washington following the violent riot in which Trump’s supporters stormed the Capitol and halted congressional proceedings. PolitiFact reported that Capitol Police were outnumbered and overwhelmed during the Jan. 6 siege. The FBI had warned about the potential for more violence at protests and events surrounding the inauguration. The National Guard said in a statement that no security incidents involving its members ever materialized. A Facebook post said ""Democrats forced our GREAT troops to sleep on the ground of a PARKING garage after dragging them to DC for photo ops!"" Our reporting found no evidence that Democratic lawmakers or members of the Biden administration ordered the relocation of the National Guard members seen sleeping in parking garages.

Black residents make up 13.7% of Michigan’s population. But in April, they accounted for 42.93% of COVID-19 deaths, according to a Detroit Free Press analysis. That share has steadily decreased, and hit a low of 7.08% in November. Even during the second wave of the pandemic that began in the fall, the case rate among Black residents mostly remained below the rate for white people, according to data from the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. Michigan seems to have bucked the national trend, as Black communities across the country continue to experience disproportionately high death rates. Gilchrist said the shift ""is a tribute and a testimony, frankly, to people of color stepping up and doing the right things to keep themselves and their families safe."" He also credited local and state efforts to address COVID-19’s toll on communities of color. It is impossible to know for sure what’s driving the trend. Experts we talked to backed up Gilchrist’s claim, but also pointed to other factors, including the way the pandemic has spread beyond the early hot spots. The disparities have closed statewide. But Dr. Philip Levy, a professor at the Wayne State University School of Medicine, attributed the shift in part to Detroit. The onset of the pandemic in late March hit southeast Michigan hard, and Detroit — where the population is nearly 80% Black — became a hot spot. But the city is no longer leading the surge in cases and deaths in Michigan. In early November, cases began raging in western Michigan. And in the late fall and early winter, the Upper Peninsula saw a big increase in COVID-19 cases and deaths. In the most recent phase, Detroit has stood out for its low infection rate, even compared with the rest of the metro area. ""Despite the rise, Detroit has stayed down,"" said Levy. ""Something must be going on, and the secret sauce, I think, is in the people themselves."" Dawn Misra, an epidemiologist at Michigan State University who conducted a mortality review of Michiganders who died from COVID-19, said she suspects that the personal impact of the pandemic on the lives of Detroiters led the city’s residents to take the virus seriously. ""Everyone who lives in Detroit ended up being probably close to someone they knew who died,"" Misra said. Levy said Detroiters’ early and personal experiences led them to embrace mask-wearing and social distancing. ""I think people really stepped up for their own personal responsibility and really recognized that they had an important role to play in this, and if people didn’t do that more people that they knew were going to die,"" he said. Black Michiganders across the state have embraced mask-wearing. A survey conducted by the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services over the summer found that 81% of Black Michiganders reported that they always wear a mask, compared with 69% of the rest of the population. ""They listened to the science,"" Misra said. Misra also credited state and local efforts to reduce racial disparities. For instance, as cases surged in Detroit, the city rolled out rapid testing for first responders, bus drivers and health care workers, becoming the first city in the country to do so. Levy helped launch a mobile testing program in Detroit that deployed vehicles to neighborhoods where cases were rising. These were among many efforts to ramp up testing in the city, said Misra. In late April, Gov. Gretchen Whitmer established the task force to examine racial disparities during the pandemic. Michigan is only one of a dozen states with such a task force, according to the National Governors’ Association. The state’s task force set up neighborhood testing sites in at-risk communities, launched media campaigns in urban communities on wearing masks and testing and provided personal protective equipment and food for quarantined individuals. But another factor in the narrowing racial disparity is the increase in cases in predominantly white areas in the state. Jon Zelner, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Michigan, said the worsening pandemic is an ""underappreciated factor"" in explaining the reduction in racial disparities. ""Some of the narrowing of that gap unfortunately kind of comes from an increase in overall case burden,"" he said. ""When you see white deaths going up, the ratio looks better,"" he added. Gilchrist claimed that Michigan has seen significant progress in reducing the racial disparities observed at the outset of the pandemic, particularly the disproportionate impact on Black residents, and credited community, state and local efforts. Public health experts and officials say Black residents as well as the state and local governments made significant efforts to narrow the disparity. But a surge in cases among white people has also contributed, as the impact of the pandemic spread beyond Detroit into predominantly white areas around the state. We rate Gilchrist’s claim Mostly True.

Kamala Harris was sworn in on a stack of Bibles — not a clutch purse
","On Jan. 20, Kamala Harris became the first female, Black and Asian American vice president of the United States. But on Facebook, some say her swearing-in ceremony was a sham. ""JUST SO YOU KNOW: She put her clutch on top of the Bible so her hand is not touching it,"" says one post published Jan. 21. (Screenshot from Facebook) The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar claims have been widely shared in groups dedicated to former President Donald Trump, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. The post includes a photo of Harris with her right hand raised as she takes the vice president’s oath of office. Her left hand is on a flat, black object resting on top of a thick Bible, which belongs to a close family friend. That object is not a clutch, as the Facebook post claims — it’s another Bible. Other fact-checkers have debunked rumors that it’s a small handbag. Harris requested the second Bible prior to Inauguration Day. It belonged to Thurgood Marshall, a former Supreme Court justice who as a civil-rights lawyer argued groundbreaking cases like Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka and Shelley v. Kraemer. In her memoir, Harris called Marshall ""one of my heroes and inspirations."" A photo of Harris’ swearing-in ceremony from another angle shows that her left hand is resting on a Bible.

WHO did not say PCR tests grossly inflate positive test numbers
","A conservative news site mischaracterized a message from the World Health Organization, claiming that the United Nations agency owned up to supporting a coronavirus test that resulted in huge numbers of false positives.  ""An hour after Joe Biden is sworn in, WHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID,"" reads the headline of an article published by the Gateway Pundit. The article links to a tweet by user Andy Swan, which in turn references a Jan. 20 notice that the WHO released to lab technicians.  Did the WHO really make such an admission? No. This article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The notice cautions lab technicians that positive results should be interpreted with care and in the context of other information, such as clinical observation and patient history, to reduce the risk of false positives. The notice — dated Jan. 13 and published on the site Jan. 20, according to the timestamp on it — is written in highly technical language. But five virologists, most of whom work in COVID-19 testing labs, told us that the gist of it was to remind lab technicians to carefully read the user manuals that come with PCR tests, the most widely used diagnostic tests for the coronavirus.  ""This is not new information. This is essentially a reminder from the WHO to testing laboratories,"" said Jonathan Jarry, a science communicator with the McGill University Office for Science and Society. ""This notice is not an admission that the PCR test for COVID-19 does not work or is wildly inaccurate.""  Coronavirus tests are performed on samples of cells taken with a swab from the back of the throat. The lab isolates the genetic material from those cells and analyzes it for traces of the virus. PCR tests, considered the most reliable, work by duplicating the genetic material in cycles until traces of the virus become more easily detectable. If there’s a large presence of virus in the sample, fewer cycles would be required to detect it, said Davidson Hamer, a professor of medicine at Boston University.  The number of cycles required to detect the virus in a sample is known as a ""cycle threshold."" A low cycle threshold implies that a patient has a high risk of spreading the coronavirus to others. The question for lab technicians is how many times to duplicate a particular sample before determining whether it is positive or negative.  ""Once you get up there in cycles, you can start detecting very small concentrations of virus,"" Hamer said.  As a result, a sample that tests positive after many amplification cycles is more likely to be a false positive than a sample that tests positive after fewer cycles. Nevertheless, Hamer said, false positives with PCR tests, even those with relatively high cycle thresholds, remain rare.  ""PCR tests are considered the gold standard of diagnostic tests,"" said Maureen Ferran, an associate professor of biology at the Rochester Institute of Technology.  Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, cautioned against viewing a low cycle threshold value as a strict indicator of high infectivity,  because some samples are less representative of the patient’s overall viral load than others.  ""It depends on how good the sample is,"" he said. The cycle threshold value ""will measure the viral load for a particular sample, but not necessarily a patient.""  In addition, the amount of cycles required to determine whether a patient is positive varies among different types of PCR tests.  ""There are different tests that have different thresholds,"" said Ben Neuman, a Texas A&M University-Texarkana virologist. ""Each lab knows where the thresholds are, and it’s their job to give you the results of your test based on their setup.""  That’s why the WHO notice urges lab technicians to view weak positive test results (ones with high cycle thresholds) with caution and to consult the instructions on their PCR machinery before issuing positive or negative test results. Gateway Pundit did not respond to our request for comment. A Gateway Pundit article claims that the ""WHO admits their testing grossly overstates individuals testing positive for COVID,"" citing a notice from the organization. However, the notice cited by the article is a reminder to lab technicians to carefully read the user’s manuals that come with PCR tests to ensure that results are interpreted correctly. It is not an admission that PCR tests don’t work or result in huge numbers of false positives. This claim is False. ​",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AE0640>],/factchecks/2021/jan/22/gateway-pundit/who-did-not-admit-pcr-tests-grossly-inflate-positi/

Antifa.com now redirects to White House website, but anyone can forward a URL without permission
","The domain name ""antifa.com"" caused a flurry in September 2020 when it redirected and took visitors to Joe Biden’s presidential campaign website instead. One day after Biden was sworn in as the 46th president, the domain began pulling up the White House’s official website, whitehouse.gov, causing yet another stir. ""ATTENTION!! Go to Antifa dot com (the correct way) and it takes you to Biden's Whitehouse!!!!"" reads a popular post on Facebook. ""What is going on?? I know b4 it went to his campaign but to put WH on it! Just a slap in the face."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Here’s what is going on. The way the internet works, any person can buy an available domain name such as antifa.com and set it to redirect to another website, without any involvement from the site it’s being redirected to.  In this case, whoever owns the domain — and the owner remains anonymous — is purposefully redirecting it to the White House site, possibly as a joke, an oblique form of commentary, or to cause mischief or confusion. There’s no evidence that Biden’s campaign or administration had anything to do with it. The redirect setting for antifa.com had changed several times before, forwarding to joebiden.com, kamalaharris.org, buildbackbetter.org, and a self-described anarchist website, itsgoingdown.org. We did not hear back from the White House about the current redirect, but Biden’s campaign denied any association with the previous antifa.com redirects. So whoever owns https://t.co/HgEpqQ9MqZ is redirecting it to our website as a troll. What we do know was that the website was registered with a Russian registrar for a while. Odd!The VP very obviously has/wants nothing to do with fringe groups. Wish Trump could say the same.   Computer experts told us that redirecting a domain name is no different from forwarding a telephone number or mailing address. The person on the receiving end can’t do much to stop it. ""Basically the way things work with domain names is, if you own a domain name, whether you’re the original purchaser or you purchased it from someone else, you can redirect your domain name to anywhere you wanted it to go,"" Clifford Neuman, director of the University of Southern California’s Center for Computer Systems Security, told PolitiFact in September. ""And that doesn’t require permission or any or coordination from the person you are trying to redirect to."" Neuman found that the antifa.com domain was first registered in 2000, and according to Whois, an online domain registry, it was last updated on Jan. 21, 2021. The registrant is listed as WhoisGuard Protected, meaning the domain owner is using a service to remain anonymous. The post is partially accurate — the domain does redirect to the White House’s website — but in implying that Biden’s White House is involved, it leaves out important details or takes things out of context.  We rate it Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C3BA00>],/factchecks/2021/jan/22/facebook-posts/antifacom-now-redirects-white-house-website-anyone/
