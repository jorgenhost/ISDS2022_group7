Bush tax cuts were passed with reconciliation's 50 votes
","Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Fla., has a reputation for using political rhetoric that pushes the envelope. On March 3, 2010, he appeared on CNN's Larry King Live along with Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., who's also known for her outspokenness from the opposite ideological perspective.Bachmann started the exchange by saying the Senate should not finalize health care reform by using reconciliation, a parliamentary maneuver that requires only 50 votes, instead of the 60 needed to stop filibusters. Bachmann said the Senate would have to ""break their own rules in order to pass the bill.""Grayson disagreed, naturally.""My esteemed colleague from Minnesota is entirely wrong,"" Grayson replied. ""There's nothing in Senate rules that prevents reconciliation. It's been used 22 times overall and 14 times by Republicans. If it's good enough for tax cuts for the rich twice under Bush, it's good enough to provide health care for all Americans.""We'll have to wait for events to play out before we learn if health care reform meets the parliamentary rules for reconciliation. The final call on the matter will likely depend on how the legislation is written and determinations made by the Senate parliamentarian and the Senate president, a role fulfilled by the vice president. We know from our previous reporting that Grayson is also correct that reconciliation was used 22 times overall and 14 times by Republicans. Here, we wanted to check Grayson's statement that reconciliation was used ""for tax cuts for the rich twice under Bush.""We checked with Grayson's staff, and they said he was referring to the large tax cuts passed in 2001 and 2003. We checked the votes, and both were passed by reconciliation.The 2001 tax cuts passed 58-33. All the Republican senators (with the exception of John McCain, R-Ariz.) were joined by 12 Democrats to pass the measure. But the tax cuts were across-the-board rate reductions for all tax filers, a detail that Grayson omitted when describing them as being ""for the rich."" It's true that the wealthy tend to pay the most taxes and thus saw the biggest drops to their tax bills. But many other taxpayers saw declines in their tax bills as well. Our previous reporting indicates that the tax cuts for the middle class during the Bush years were more costly than the tax cuts for the highest incomes, because the middle class outnumbers the very wealthy.The 2003 tax cuts were also passed by reconciliation. These were more controversial, because at this point the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan had started, and later the same year Congress passed a Medicare prescription drug benefit. The vote in the Senate was 51-50, with vice president Dick Cheney breaking the tie. (The vice president is technically the president of the Senate and can break ties.) In this vote, only two Democrats joined the Republicans.The 2003 tax cuts included a number of measures, but the most significant reductions were taxes on dividends and capital gains taxes. Typically, these taxes are on investment income, and those cuts tend to give a bigger break to taxpayers with higher incomes. Grayson is taking a bit of a liberty by describing the measures as ""tax cuts for the rich,"" especially the 2001 cuts, when tax rates were rolled back across income categories. Still, the wealthy did receive significant benefits from the tax cuts since they pay the most taxes, and that was particularly true of the 2003 package. Grayson is correct that the tax cuts were both passed by reconciliation. The 2003 vote, in fact, passed by the narrowest of margins. So we rate his statement Mostly True.","[('Thomas, HR 2 (the 2003 tax cuts), became law May 28, 2003The U.S. Senate, Reconciliation vote on the 2003 tax cuts, May 23, 2003Thomas, HR 1836 (the 2001 tax cuts), became law June 7, 2001The U.S. Senate, Reconciliation vote on the 2001 tax cuts, May 26, 2001', 'http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:H.R.2:')]",/factchecks/2010/mar/05/alan-grayson/bush-tax-cuts-were-passed-reconciliations-50-votes/

Bachmann says Democratic health care bill won't lower costs for average Americans
","Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., has a reputation for using political rhetoric that pushes the envelope. On March 3, 2010, she appeared on CNN's Larry King Live along with Democratic Rep. Alan Grayson, a Floridian who's also known for his outspokenness from the opposite ideological perspective.We thought we'd look into one of the comments she made about the issue of the day: the Democratic health care reform plan.""Unfortunately,"" she said, ""President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs for average Americans -- or really for very few Americans, if any.""To test this claim, we turned first to the nonpartisan referee for such questions -- the Congressional Budget Office.We looked at a CBO analysis of the Senate Democratic health care bill released Nov. 30, 2009. This bill -- which was passed by the Senate in December 2009 -- forms the basis for President Barack Obama's own proposal. (The CBO has not directly analyzed Obama's proposal, but most health policy analysts do not expect the numbers to change dramatically from what the CBO analyzed in November.)Before we dig into the CBO study, we should outline the three types of private coverage and how they differ. Individual policies are obtained directly by individuals or families, without an employer serving as an intermediary. ""Small-group"" plans are provided through small employers. And ""large-group"" policies are plans obtained through larger employers. The CBO looked at the effect of the health care bill on premiums for each category.One other thing to know: The bill provides subsidies for people in the individual and small-group markets whose income is below certain thresholds. The CBO looked at how the bill would change premiums both before subsidies were factored in and after.So here's what the CBO expects for 2016, the year its analysts chose as the benchmark.For individual plans -- before subsidies are taken into account -- the bill would make policies 10 percent to 13 percent more expensive. But a big reason for this increase is that the bill would set higher minimum standards for coverage. So, before subsidies are factored in, people and families buying individual policies would have to pay more, but they would also be getting more generous coverage.However, it's worth noting that many people on the individual market would qualify for subsidies. In fact, the CBO estimates that 57 percent of individual-market purchasers would. And once these subsidies are factored in, buyers on the individual market would see their premiums drop quite a bit -- between 56 percent and 59 percent, according to the CBO. (The question of whether to count or not to count subsidies when analyzing the bill became a major bone of contention during the Feb. 25, 2010, presidential health care summit; you can read a previous PolitiFact item for a more detailed explanation of this question, http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2010/feb/25/barack-obama/obama-says-under-democratic-health-plan-family-ins/)For the second category -- the small-group market -- the CBO estimates that unsubsidized premiums would land somewhere on the continuum between rising by 1 percent and falling by 2 percent. For the 12 percent of small-group beneficiaries who are expected to qualify for subsidies, premiums would fall by 8 to 11 percent.Finally, in the third category -- the large-group market -- the change in premiums would range from no change to a 3 percent decline. (Large-group beneficiaries are not eligible for subsidies under the bill.)To fuly analyze Bachmann's claim, we need to add in one additional factor: the number of Americans who will buy insurance in each of these three markets.The CBO estimates that 134 million people will be covered by large-group plans, 25 million will be covered by small-group plans and 32 million will be covered by individual market plans. The total of these three categories is 191 million people. (Remember that many Americans are covered by Medicare, Medicaid or other government plans, and these are not included in the CBO's analysis, or in ours.)Let's first analyze these numbers using the strictest definition -- unsubsidized premiums. And because the CBO is using a range of likely outcomes, we'll do our best to quantify how many people will actually see their premiums fall. We'll do this by assuming that, say, for a range of 10 percent to 13 percent, one quarter will see a change of 10 percent, one quarter will see a change of 11 percent, one quarter will see a change of 12 percent, and one quarter will see a change of 13 percent. The real numbers will not fit so neatly into that kind of breakdown, but health economists tell us it's a serviceable guide.By our reckoning, then, three quarters of the 134 million people in large-group plans -- 101 million -- will see their premiums fall slightly. Next, in the small group market, let's assume that half the beneficiaries will see a decline in premiums (those who see their premiums fall by 1 percent or 2 percent.) That translates to about 13 million people. So, right off the bat -- without factoring in subsidies -- the CBO expects 114 million people to see their premiums go down at least a little bit. That's about 60 percent of beneficiaries.Once subsidies are accounted for, the percentages rise.In the small-group market, 12 percent of beneficiaries would qualify for subsidies, the CBO projects. Proportionally, these subsidies would reduce premiums for an additional 1.5 million people.In the individual market, 57 percent would qualify for subsidies, according to CBO. That's about 18 million people who'd see their premiums drop.So, adding it up, nearly 134 million people should see their premiums go down when subsidies are factored in. That's about 70 percent of all privately insured Americans.What about the rest? By our calculations, about 45 million people would see their premiums stay the same. Adding them to the 134 million Americans who saw their premiums drop, you get 179 million people, or almost 94 percent of those on private insurance.That leaves about 14 million Americans who would see their premiums go up, according to the CBO's model. (The numbers don't add up to 191 million due to rounding.) These unlucky beneficiaries -- mostly people with individual insurance who earn too much to receive subsidies -- account for 7 percent of those with private insurance in 2016.Of course, the CBO's projections are only that -- projections. In addition, basic mathematics suggests that some number of Americans will see their premiums rise or fall by greater amounts than the CBO estimates. So our exercise should be taken with due caution. But the CBO is the generally accepted arbiter of these questions and the overall trend seems solid despite the caveats. However, looked at another way, Bachmann would have had a stronger point if she had said the bill's benefits are limited. Only about 21 million people -- those who receive subsidies -- will see their premiums drop by more than a few percentage points. That's about 11 percent of the people with private insurance in 2016 -- within shouting distance of the ""very few Americans"" she referenced in her quote.Measured in raw dollars, a decrease of 1 to 3 percent won't put a whole lot of additional money in the pockets of the other nine-tenths of the private market. By the CBO's estimate, the difference could be on the order of $100 or $200 on a several-thousand-dollar policy. But we're rating Bachmann's claim that ""President Obama's bill won't bring down the costs (of health care) for average Americans -- or really for very few Americans, if any."" And on that, our interpretation of the CBO numbers indicates she's wrong. Using the strict, unsubsidized figures, 60 percent of Americans in the private insurance market should see their premiums fall. And taking into account the subsidies, a full 70 percent would see their premiums fall. And almost 94 percent would see their premiums either fall or stay the same. No matter how you slice it, the overwhelming majority are likely to see a decline. So we find her claim False.","[('Congressional Budget Office, ""An Analysis of Health Insurance Premiums Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,"" Nov. 30, 2009Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Office of the Actuary, analysis of the Senate health care bill, Dec. 10, 2009E-mail interview with Paul N.

White says Texas debt has doubled under Perry

","

Race for governor, Round 2.

Gov. Rick Perry bested U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison and underdog Debra Medina in the Republican primary while former Houston Mayor Bill White walloped businessman Farouk Shami for the Democratic nomination.

Celebrating separately Tuesday night, both candidates rallied their respective supporters.

For Perry, that meant warning Washington to ""stop messing with Texas,"" a tenet of his primary campaign. White, meanwhile, started to niggle his new opponent — suggesting Perry and his consultants point to national debt to distract voters from Texas' record.

""Debt has almost doubled in Austin under Gov. Perry,"" White said. ""They think you will not notice this!""

Game on. 
Is White right?

We checked with the Texas Bond Review Board, which oversees the state's issuance of most bonds used to fund numerous activities, from helping local governments with economic development to building prisons to making housing loans to veterans. According to the board's annual reports, Texas had $34.08 billion in outstanding bonds and notes as of Aug. 31 — the end of the 2009 fiscal year.

Perry took office Dec. 21, 2000 — nearly five months into fiscal year 2001. At the end of that year, Texas had $13.7 billion in outstanding bonds and notes. Adjusting for inflation, that would have equaled $16.6 billion in 2009.

But there's a subset of state debt that hasn't surged, Perry's campaign pointed out — currently $3.07 billion to support parks and for construction of state facilities, among other activities. That debt has decreased by about 6 percent since 2001.

Then there's debt to be repaid with program revenue. For example, interest on student loans is used to repay the bond that funded it without the state having to commit general revenue. That ""self-supporting"" debt has increased by 173 percent since 2001.

Regardless, Dale Craymer, president of the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, noted that lots of things have probably doubled since Perry became governor. After all, he's held the office for nearly a decade.

Eva DeLuna Castro, a senior budget analyst at the Center for Public Policy Priorities, also said it'd be a stretch to say Perry was solely responsible for all those debt decisions.

""Voters do that, and the Legislature,"" she said. ""So we're all responsible.""

Perry is one of four members on the Bond Review Board, which ultimately approves most state debt transactions. And over the years, we found, he was a leading advocate for expanding state debts to pay for transportation projects and to combat cancer.

It turns out that transportation is responsible for most of the added debt load under Perry, increasing from basically nothing in 2000 to $11.8 billion outstanding as of Aug. 31 2009. That's because before 2001, the Texas Department of Transportation lacked the authority to borrow money to pay for road projects. Voters gave it that power in 2001 when they approved a constitutional amendment that Perry supported.

Addressing transportation in his 2001 state of the state speech, Perry said, ""I would like for both chambers to pass a bonding program to jump-start construction across our state.""

In 2007, voters also passed a constitutional amendment to create and fund the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas with $3 billion in bonds over 10 years, starting in January 2010. Perry had championed the cause with cyclist and cancer survivor Lance Armstrong and others.

Where does that leave us?

It's clear the amount of state debt has more than doubled since Perry became governor.

We rate White's statement as True.","[('\nInterview with Chris Lippincott, spokesman for Texas Department of Transportation, March 3, 2010\n\nInterview with Eva DeLuna Castro, senior budget analyst, Center for Public Policy Priorities, March 3, 2010\n\nInterview with Dale Craymer, president, Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, March 3, 2010\n\nInterview with Bob Kline, executive director, Texas Bond Review Board, March 3 and 4, 2010\n\nOffice of the Governor, Cancer Research Initiative, accessed March 3, 2010\n\nOffice of the Governor, state of the state address, Jan. 25, 2001\n\nTexas Bond Review Board, Annual Report for Fiscal 2003, 2003\n\nTexas Bond Review Board, Annual Report for Fiscal 2009, 2009\n\nTexas Bond Review Board, Debt affordability study, February 2009', 'http://www.governor.state.tx.us/priorities/families/healthier_citizens/cancer_research_initiative/')]",/factchecks/2010/mar/04/bill-white/white-says-texas-debt-has-doubled-under-perry/

Democrats say McCollum voted to ""dismantle"" Social Security
","The Florida Democratic Party says Attorney General Bill McCollum, a Republican candidate for governor, has targeted a sacred cow: Social Security.In a press release Feb. 3, 2010, the state party said that when he was in Congress, McCollum ""voted to dismantle Social Security."" That's a major charge. The Democrats are not simply saying he voted to reduce the program that provides income for millions of senior citizens, but alleging that he sought to tear it apart. To back up the claim, the Democrats cited nine votes McCollum took related to Social Security in the 1990s. The McCollum campaign doesn't dispute the individual votes but disagrees with how they're being interpreted. ""Bill McCollum was always a supporter of Social Security, despite the attempts of Democrats to portray him (and every other Republican) as its enemy,'' wrote McCollum campaign spokeswoman Kristy Campbell in an e-mail.We examined those votes and showed them to experts on Social Security. We then concluded the Democrats are distorting McCollum's votes and making an incorrect claim based on flimsy evidence.Patricia Dilley, a University of Florida law professor who helped write Social Security legislation in the 1980s, said it was a stretch to describe the votes in such stark terms. ""There is not a vote in here directly to dismantle Social Security,'' she said.The Democrats cite these votes by McCollum to support their claim:* McCollum voted in May 1995 for a Republican budget resolution that would have used a lower rate of growth in the Consumer Price Index, which is used to calculate cost-of-living adjustments for Social Security and other programs. Some economists have said the CPI overstates inflation, prompting Republican proposals to reduce the growth in the CPI. Henry Aaron, a senior fellow who studies health care for the left-leaning Brookings Institution, said the GOP proposal that McCollum supported would have reduced future benefits -- and reduced the purchasing power of seniors who receive Social Security. But he said ""it's not dismantling"" the program. * McCollum voted against using the surplus from the overall federal budget to bolster Social Security. The Florida Democratic Party said that, ""In the late 1990's, when both the federal budget and Social Security were running surpluses, McCollum voted seven times against using those surpluses to secure Social Security.""The party is referring to an initiative by then-President Bill Clinton to set aside the surplus for Social Security -- to put the money in the ""lockbox"" that became the subject of many jokes (and some funny Saturday Night Live skits) during the 2000 campaign. So the Democrats are alleging that because McCollum didn't want to put the money in their version of a lockbox that it's the equivalent of dismantling the program.Let's examine one of the votes the Democrats cite, a House resolution in May 1999 to do just that. McCollum voted no.But as the McCollum campaign noted, on the same day, he voted for a measure approved by the vast majority of Republicans and Democrats that aimed to make it more difficult for Congress to borrow from the Social Security trust fund surplus to pay for other programs. The vote was supposed to signal the GOP's support for Social Security, even if Republicans didn't want the surpluses used for it. (Republicans preferred using the surplus to provide broad tax cuts.) ""He absolutely voted for the lockbox,'' said Campbell. ""It was a question of how much he put in the lockbox. Do you put everything in the kitchen sink for the lockbox or do you preserve the trust fund itself. It was the question for two or three years.""There's disagreement about the significance of these votes. Aaron said the proposals about lockboxes and securing the surplus were ""completely bogus. The surplus of Social Security is secured -- they hold Treasury bonds -- Social Security can cash them in at face value whenever they need the money. I think voting for or against the bills didn't amount to much because Social security reserves are already safe.""But Dilley said the lockbox bills could have had some long-term value. ""If the lockbox had passed, it would be much more difficult for people to argue we need to cut Social Security to balance the budget,'' Dilley said. ""It would have meant people could not now be making the argument we need to address the federal deficit by privatizing or cutting Social Security.""Still, we don't see evidence here that the votes were to dismantle the program. They simply reflect different strategies by the parties about what to do with the federal budget surplus.* The Democrats also cite McCollum's votes for $80 billion in tax cuts as ""using the Social Security surplus."" They contend that McCollum's support of the tax cuts effectively raided the surplus that could have been used for Social Security. McCollum did vote for the tax cuts, but it's a huge leap of logic to equate that with ""dismantling"" Social Security. Congress tapped the surplus from the general fund, not directly from Social Security accounts. Former U.S. Rep. Clay Shaw, a Republican from Fort Lauderdale who chaired the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Social Security, said by the Democrats' logic that ""you could make the argument that anything is coming out of Social Security.""And contrary to the Democrats' overall point, we found a few articles that mention votes McCollum took to protect Social Security. McCollum even bucked his party to vote for an amendment by Democrat Rep. Barney Frank to protect the program, according to a Jan. 12, 1995, article in Newsday. Frank's amendment was to exempt the Social Security Trust Fund from an amendment to balance the budget.""There should be no temptation to reduce Social Security benefits to achieve the goal of a balanced budget,"" Frank argued, according to the Newsday article.McCollum was the ""lone Republican to vote for Frank's losing proposal. He comes from Florida, which has a large retired population,'' the Newsday article stated.McCollum's campaign also pointed to a 1983 bill McCollum supported that was ""to assure the solvency of the Social Security Trust Funds.""The Democrats, meanwhile, cited a few news articles with McCollum's comments about George Bush's suggestions during the 2000 presidential campaign to create individual investment accounts for Social Security. That proposal, which would have retained traditional Social Security benefits for older Americans and given younger workers the flexibility to invest the money in different kinds of accounts, was criticized by many Democrats who said it was an effort to dismantle the program. Republicans said they were merely trying to give younger workers more control of their money and an opportunity for higher returns.The Orlando Sentinel quoted McCollum as saying, ""I don’t believe in privatizing Social Security. I do believe, however, that the next generation ought to have the right to grow private saving accounts and have a greater savings opportunity than the seniors have had today,"" McCollum said.But it's important to note that their only evidence about the Bush proposal comes from comments in news stories. They do not cite any votes because the proposal did not come before a vote of the full House. So the Democrats have built a strong charge on flimsy evidence. Yes, McCollum opposed Democratic proposals to use the surplus for Social Security and he wanted to slow the growth in the Consumer Price Index for Social Security and he spoke in favor of Bush's proposal. But it's a ridiculous leap to equate those votes with ""dismantling"" the program.

Gov. Rick Perry says Congress hiked debt limit to $14 trillion and federal budget under preparation has over $5 trillion in debt over five years
","
After winning the 2010 Republican nomination for governor, Gov. Rick Perry told supporters Tuesday that energized voters are upset at congressional spending.

In a wide-ranging speech, Perry specified two factors, saying: ""Washington cannot hide from the fact that Congress hiked the national debt ceiling to $14.3 trillion. They cannot hide from the fact . . . that the budget that they’re going forward with has more than $5 trillion in debt in it over the next five years.""

Do those debt numbers hold up?

Perry's campaign pointed us to news accounts of the U.S. House and Senate voting in January to raise the federal government’s debt limit to $14.3 trillion, a historic high adopted solely with Democratic votes in the Democrat-majority bodies. Proponents noted that the increase was needed to allow the government to continue borrowing and avoid default.

On Perry's reference to the federal debt increasing by $5 trillion over five years, his campaign pointed to a Feb. 1 article on President Barack Obama's proposed 2011 federal budget. The story says Obama's proposal would result in deficits of $5.08 trillion over five years. 
Separately, Obama's proposed budget shows the nation's public debt increasing from $7.5 trillion in 2009, reflecting actions taken under President George W. Bush and the Congress that made budget decisions in 2008, to $13.1 trillion in 2014—potentially increasing $5.6 trillion. The debt increase from 2010 to 2015 is projected at $4.7 trillion. 
Josh Gordon of The Concord Coalition, which advocates long-term fiscal responsibilty, cautioned that much of the current and immediately expected deficits are due to economic troubles and not White House or congressional actions. Gordon said it's typical for government to run a deficit during an economic downturn. 
In the end, Obama’s proposed budget won’t sail through Congress; presidents (and governors) propose, lawmakers dispose. Still, Obama's proposal seems a reasonable basis for Perry’s debt claim.

The governor also is correct on the size of the increased federal debt limit.

Crist claims highest graduation rate ever
","In this final State of the State address on March 2, 2010, Gov. Charlie Crist highlighted Florida's progress in many areas. In addition to lower crime rates and money to restore the Everglades, Crist devoted a significant portion of his speech to education.Among other statistics, Crist made this superlative claim: ""Our graduation rate is the highest it's ever been.""We figured this statement came with an unspoken asterisk similar to weather records (""since official records began"") or baseball statistics (""the Modern Era""). There probably was a graduation rate in 1845 when Florida became a state, but it makes little sense to compare it to today's rate.Despite the statistical obstacles, we wanted to know: Is Florida's graduation rate at its highest point ever?Starting in 1975, there are three years with higher graduation rates than the current year. But previous calculations varied widely and comparing those rates with those from the Modern Era simply isn't valid.Now, the Modern Era of Florida's graduation rate began in the 1998-99 school year, when the state began tracking groups of students instead of simply dividing the number of diplomas by the freshman class four years earlier. Previous formulas did not account for transfer students and also counted more groups of students as earning diplomas.The More Accurate Modern Era began in 2004-05, when a new measure stopped including GEDs in the rate. So ""ever"" in Crist's quote means five years, or at best 10. In addition, there are several groups that measure graduation rates. The conservative Manhattan Institute think tank publishes one. Education Week's rate is oft-quoted in the media. Both of those rates, though, use federal data to estimate freshman class sizes and then compare those numbers to diplomas awarded four years later. From 1998 until 2009, Florida used a method considered more accurate that tracks groups of freshman students, or ""cohorts,"" throughout high school.The U.S. Department of Education will require all states to move to a standard system by next school year. For the transition, Florida has moved to a similar ""cohort"" rate developed by the National Governors Association in 2005. Unlike the 1998 rate, it only counts diplomas and does not include students who earned a GED.Okay, enough about the methodology. On to the numbers! Under the 1998 rubric, Florida's graduation rate has steadily increased every year, except for a dip in 2005-06. It rose from 60.2 percent to 78.6 percent in 2008-09 -- the highest under that formula.For the NGA calculation -- which is the figure trumpeted by Crist's office in December 2009 as the ""highest ever"" -- Florida's rate has increased from 69.7 percent in 2004-05 to 76.3 percent last year. Again, that topped the mercury level on the graduation rate thermometer.""Which sounds pretty good,"" said University of South Florida professor Sherman Dorn. ""But there's a caveat.""Dorn says the increased graduation rate corresponds closely with an increase in students who received a diploma even after failing the FCAT three times. Such students can replace their FCAT scores with SAT scores of 410 for reading and 370 for math. (The number of those degrees jumped from 569 in 2004-05 to 9,410 last year.) Without those degrees included, last year's rate falls to 71.2 percent. It's still the highest ever, Dorn says, ""by about a hair.""State Department of Education spokesman Tom Bulter defended keeping those students in the count. Under state law, they received standard diplomas. ""It really is a process of law,"" he said.In his speech to lawmakers, Crist claimed the state's graduation rate is ""the highest it's ever been."" And several formulas say that's true -- to varying degrees. But Joe Citizen doesn't think of ""ever"" as beginning in 2005, or even 1999. We understand that accurate statistics only go back so far, but Crist could have been more clear. We rate his statement Mostly True.

"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Crist says Cover Florida offers basic health coverage for about $150 per month
","In his State of the State address, Gov. Charlie Crist cited a litany of accomplishments. Among them: Cover Florida, a state-backed health insurance plan designed to make coverage available to uninsured residents.""This program is available to almost any Floridian, offering basic coverage for about $150 a month, instead of the typical $600 a month,"" he said. ""As with any private sector plan, the more extensive coverage you want, the higher the premiums, but with so many lacking basic preventive care, Cover Florida remains a sound option for thousands of Floridians."" When we checked a similar claim from Crist in October, Crist said it usually costs $900 to get health insurance. That earned a False ruling because he was comparing apples and oranges. His claim is different this time, and so is the produce-aisle metaphor we're using to describe his technique: He's cherry-picking.First, some background. Launched in 2008, Cover Florida allows people without coverage for at least six months to pick from plans offered by six insurance companies. The state selected each provider through a competitive bidding process. The provider offers at least two options — one with catastrophic and hospital coverage, and another plan that can provide less coverage. The program's Web site says that the statewide individual plans can be purchased for as little as $23 a month, to as much as $500 a month, depending on age, gender and level of coverage. Patients pick and choose between various options offered through the insurers. So, for example, a woman who is between 19 and 29 years of age can pay $130 a month for a plan that includes no deductible, $10 copays for doctor visits, but no hospital inpatient coverage. Critics contend Cover Florida Health Care hasn't done enough to cover the uninsured. As of Dec. 31, 2009, about 5,400 people have enrolled — about 0.1 percent of the state's uninsured population, which Crist put at 3.8 million in his speech. But in his speech, Crist avoided those numbers and focused instead on the price. Let's examine both numbers he used. First, Crist avoided the apples and oranges mistake he made last time, in which he compared a number for family coverage with a number for individuals. But he stretched the truth in other ways. He said basic coverage is available for about $150 a month. But we find that he's chosen a low number from the wide menu of options to give himself a favorable comparison. When people think about health insurance they probably think of coverage that includes hospitalization. And the two statewide Cover Florida plans that offer that coverage are Blue Cross Blue Shield -- average cost $148 for a single -- and United Healthcare, which averages $327. It's also worth noting that is for very basic coverage that includes higher deductibles than you might typically get for a traditional health plan from your employer. The other part of Crist's claim is that the typical price for coverage for an individual is $600 a month. But we checked that against numbers from the Kaiser Family Foundation, which Crist's office had cited when we checked his earlier claim, and found he's way off. A 2009 Kaiser study says the average monthly cost for a single plan from an employer is $402. (On average, Kaiser found that employers pay 83 percent of an individual's cost, leaving workers to pay about $68). A study by eHealth, which offers coverage to people on the individual market when they cannot get employer coverage, said the average monthly cost is $161. That number is lower than the employer-provided cost because the policies typically have higher deductibles or fewer benefits. Also, insurers in the individual market can deny coverage for pre-existing conditions. So Crist's overall point has some truth to it -- you can get basic coverage for $150. But he's doing some artful cherry-picking. He chose the lowest average rate for Cover Florida ($150, when the other plan costs $327) and a very high number for the private market ($600, when studies show it would cost more in the range of $160-$400.) That's such a significant difference that we find his claim Barely True.","[('Fox News, Congressional Quarterly transcripts, Oct. 21, 2009', 'http://www.coverfloridahealthcare.com/'), ('Cover Florida Health Care, Frequently Asked Questions , accessed Oct. 23, 2009', 'No link'), ('Cover Florida Health Care, January 2010 Enrollment Summary, accessed March 3, 2010', 'http://www.coverfloridahealthcare.com/docs/SUMMARY_January.pdf'), (""St. Petersburg Times, Why is Charlie Crist Bragging About Cover Florida? , by Marc Caputo, Aug. 9, 2009 St. Petersburg Times, Crist's health care initiative starts slow, but becomes a major campaign talking point , Marc Caputo, Aug. 11, 2009"", 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, Employer Health Benefits: 2009 Annual Survey , accessed Oct. 23, 2009', 'http://blogs.tampabay.com/buzz/2009/08/why-is-charlie-crist-bragging-about-cover-florida.html'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, Survey Shows Private Health Insurance Premiums Rose 11.2% in 2004 , accessed Oct. 23, 2009', 'No link'), ('Kaiser Family Foundation, Employer Health Benefits: 2006 Summary of Findings , accessed Oct. 23, 2009', 'http://ehbs.kff.org/pdf/2009/7936.pdf'), ('eHealth, Health Insurance Premiums: eHealth, Inc.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney says Americans pay more for health care but die sooner
","In his new book, No Apology, former Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney devotes a chapter to health care policy -- a topic that animated his tenure as governor of Massachusetts.Romney, working with a Democratic-dominated legislature, passed a health care overhaul that was designed to get his state as close to universal coverage as possible. Romney is now often discussed as a presidential candidate for 2012, which has forced him into an uncomfortable balancing act: He seeks to lead a party intent on blocking President Barack Obama's health care proposal, even though he himself enacted a plan that, according to many sources we interviewed earlier this year, shares much in common with what Obama is proposing.We looked through the health care chapter of Romney's book as well as transcripts of his recent media appearances, but we were unable to locate a clear, fact-checkable statement addressing the similarities and differences between the two bills. (He broached the issue on a number of occasions, but in each case he phrased his statements in such a way that made it difficult for us to subject them to the Truth-O-Meter.)So while Romney did not compare the Massachusetts plan with Obama's proposal, in his book he compared the U.S. system with other nations'.""The lifespan of the average American is less than that of people in nations that spend far less"" on health care, Romney wrote, adding, ""To put it bluntly, we spend more and die sooner.""The first place we looked was the statistical archive of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group that represents 30 advanced, industrialized nations, mostly in Europe, Asia and North America. Scholars consider OECD figures to be among the most reliable for international comparisons on health care.First, we'll look at life expectancy -- the number of years someone born in a certain year can expect to live. The OECD's most recent figures, for either 2005 or 2006 (the year varies by country), show that the United States ranks 24th -- well under the average level for the 30 nations studied.Specifically, life expectancy in the United States was 77.8 years. That put it behind the following nations, in descending order: Japan (at 82.4 years in 2006), Switzerland, Iceland, Spain, Australia, Italy, France, Sweden, Norway, Canada, New Zealand, Austria, the Netherlands, Germany, Ireland, Greece, Finland, Belgium, Luxembourg, the United Kingdom, South Korea, Portugal and Denmark.Meanwhile, health and population economists at the World Health Organization devised another measure to gauge life expectancy -- disability-adjusted life expectancy, or how many years one can expect to live before becoming disabled by old-age illnesses. WHO did its last full-blown international comparison of DALE, as it is abberviated, in 2000, and the results are much the same.The United States ranked 24th on the WHO list with exactly 70 years of DALE. It trailed Japan (with 74.5), Australia, France, Sweden, Spain, Italy, Greece, Switzerland, Monaco, Andorra, San Marino, Canada, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Norway, Belgium, Austria, Luxembourg, Iceland, Finland, Malta, Germany and Israel.Now, we'll look at health care expenditures. There are two ways to measure this -- by expenditures per capita, or by expenditures as a percentage of GDP. However you measure it, we're No. 1 -- by a mile.Using the first measure, the OECD reports that the United States spent $7,290 on health care per capita in 2007. The only two other countries where per capita health care expenditures exceeded even $4,000 were Norway and Switzerland.Using the second measure, the United States spent more than 15 percent of GDP on health care in 2006, according to the OECD. Only Switzerland and France exceeded 11 percent.To take one extreme case, South Korea spends less than a quarter per capita of what the United States spends on health care -- yet its people, on average, live past 79 years of age, which is more than one full year longer than Americans do.Ali Mokdad, a professor in global health at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, attributes the United States' poor showing in part to a lack of emphasis on preventive care.""We have fallen behind other countries in tackling the root causes of mortality and disease,"" Mokdad said. ""We know, for example, that just reducing salt in people’s diets can save more than 100,000 lives a year, but there is much more discussion in this country about health insurance, which would save, at best, about half as many people.""Whatever the reason, and however you measure it, Americans ""spend more and die sooner,"" as Romney so bluntly put it.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Pelosi says Democrats tackle pre-existing conditions, Republicans don't
","Few elements of today's health care system are as maddening to most Americans as the denial of insurance to those who suffer from pre-existing conditions. A Kaiser Family Foundation tracking poll from September 2009 found that eight of every 10 respondents -- including 67 percent of Republicans, 80 percent of independents and 88 percent of Democrats -- would support a requirement that insurance companies cover anyone who applies.So it's not surprising that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., would tout her efforts to achieve that policy goal in a Feb. 28, 2010, interview on ABC's This Week.Sitting down with host Elizabeth Vargas, Pelosi outlined some differences between her approach and that of House Republicans. One example, she said, ""is ending the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition. The Democrats have that in their bill. The Republicans do not.""We looked at the bills and checked with experts across the ideological spectrum to gauge whether Pelosi is making a fair comparison. What we found is that both bills explicitly take on the issue of pre-existing conditions, but the policy prescriptions differ, complicating the process of analyzing Pelosi's claim.First we'll look at the Democratic bill. Most observers would agree that Pelosi is correct that the House bill -- which passed her chamber narrowly last year -- does indeed end the denial of coverage for those who have a pre-existing condition, though not without some caveats.The House bill -- in language later echoed by President Barack Obama's proposed bill -- bars the exclusion of applicants due to a pre-existing condition in three settings: in the individual market (that is, in policies bought separately by families and individuals), in the exchange (the new, virtual marketplace for purchasing insurance that would be set up by the bill), and in the small group market (policies purchased through small employers).One caveat is that this policy wouldn't take effect immediately; it would begin Jan. 1, 2014. Until the new rules kick in, individuals who have been uninsured for at least six months and have a pre-existing medical condition could enroll in a ""high-risk pool"" with subsidized premiums. (Remember the term ""high-risk pool"" -- we'll encounter it again shortly.)There's a second caveat, too: Michael Cannon, a health care expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, says that the Democratic approach could have unintended consequences. While the law would bar outright rejections of applicants with pre-existing conditions, he said, there's nothing to stop insurance companies from treating such patients poorly, in the hope of foisting them -- and their higher health care bills -- on their competitors. Indeed, Cannon suggests, a failure to act this way could endanger the very economic viability of these insurers.""The Democratic bills create such perverse incentives for insurers to offer inadequate care and lousy customer service that sick people with insurance may feel like the bill made things worse,"" Cannon said.Still, even taking into account these caveats, there's ample evidence that Pelosi is on solid ground when she states that the Democratic bill ""would end 'the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition' "" -- though it might take a few years to get there.What about the Republican bill? The bill in question is an amendment offered by House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, that was voted down along party lines shortly before the Democratic bill passed. This measure explicitly targets the issue of pre-existing conditions -- in fact, in the bill's preamble, it says the purpose of the act ""is to take meaningful steps to lower health care costs and increase access to health insurance coverage (especially for individuals with pre-existing conditions).""However, it goes about it in a very different way from the Democratic bill -- and that led our sources to vary widely in their assessments of Pelosi's claim.Rather than outlawing such denials by insurance companies, the Republican bill would instead make sure that those with pre-existing conditions have access to coverage -- somewhere. It would do this by creating -- here's that phrase again -- ""high-risk pools."" These pools would guarantee those with pre-existing conditions an offer of coverage. The Republican bill would also cap the premiums charged by such pools and provide funding to help states manage them.Now, it's true that the Democratic approach also uses high-risk pools. But the architects of the Democratic bills envision them as a stopgap solution. The Republican measure, by contrast, considers them the permanent solution. And many health care experts say that high-risk pools are too flawed a concept to be relied upon over the long term.This belief is based on a track record from more than two dozen states that have implemented high-risk pools.Health economists often talk about ""community rating"" -- the idea that premiums can be kept down if you insure a large enough and diverse enough pool of people. This happens because those who are healthier (and cheaper to cover) effectively subsidize those who are sicker (and more expensive).But by their very nature, high-risk pools are not diverse. They take the sickest and most expensive patients who are not already covered by Medicare, Medicaid or another type of health plan. By concentrating sicker patients in the same plan, these pools can't rely on healthier, cheaper patients to shoulder the cost burden. So high-risk pools usually face steep costs and, in turn, steep premiums for beneficiaries (or for the government entities that subsidize those beneficiaries).These high costs have limited the appeal of high-risk pools. According to Pelosi's office, only about 200,000 Americans belong to the existing state high-risk pools -- a tiny fraction of the 46 million uninsured Americans. The Republican bill's incentives could boost enrollment, but to truly become a long-term solution would require significant subsidies -- more, critics say, than the Republican bill provides.Jonathan Cohn, a health care journalist, recently wrote in the New Republic, a liberal magazine, that the GOP bill ""sets aside about $4 billion a year when fully phased in. By comparison, when John McCain proposed creating high-risk pools in the 2008 presidential campaign, his economic adviser, Douglas Holtz-Eakin, estimated it would take between $7 billion and $10 billion a year to cover all of the medically uninsurable through them.""So, what to make of this? We feel reasonably confident about two things.One is that the GOP approach doesn't explicitly end ""the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition,"" as Pelosi indicated. Insurers would still be able to discriminate against those with pre-existing conditions; the policy would instead allow those who are rejected to be provided access to coverage elsewhere.The second is that while it's impossible to know whether the Republican approach would succeed or fail, it's clear that many health experts are skeptical about the GOP's ability to provide coverage to all or virtually all of those who have pre-existing conditions.Ultimately, both parties' approaches have their critics. But we believe that, despite some caveats, Pelosi is basically correct in saying that the Democratic approach would explicitly end ""the denial of ... coverage to those who have a pre-existing condition."" As for Pelosi's belief that the Republican approach fails to do the same, she unfairly glosses over the fact that the GOP proposal makes it a high-priority goal and that it provides a path (albeit a controversial one) to get there. Still, Pelosi is correct that under the GOP plan, insurers would still be able to deny coverage to those with pre-existing conditions. On balance, then, we rate her statement Mostly True.","[('ABC\'s This Week, interview with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Feb. 28, 2010Text of Republican amendment in the nature of a substitute to H.R. 3962 (the Democratic health care reform bill), accessed Mar. 2, 2010Kaiser Family Foundation, Kaiser Health Tracking Poll (summary), Sept. 2009Kaiser Family Foundation, side-by-side comparison of major health care bills, accessed Mar. 2, 2010Jonathan Cohn, ""The GOP\'s Pre-Existing Ideology: Why the Republican plan to insure the already-ill doesn\'t work"" (column in the New Republic), Mar. 1, 2010', 'https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/week-transcript-house-speaker-nancy-pelosi-sen-lamar/story?id=9955285&page=2'), ('Michael F.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Mindy Montford']","
UPDATE: Judicial candidate Mindy Montford says in mailer plus a door hanger that she's had over 100 jury trials in Travis County
","
Austin lawyer Mindy Montford, seeking the Democratic nomination for a state district judgeship, says she’s got vast courthouse experience, much of that from eight-plus years as a Travis County assistant district attorney, which followed her job as a Harris County prosecutor.

Montford, running for judge of the 299th state district court, says on her campaign Web site that she’s had over 100 trials and handled thousands of cases, a claim that seems possible considering she worked nearly a decade as a prosecutor.

We were exploring those claims when we came across a more dramatic Montford mailer that reached voters in mid-February. It states that Montford ""has tried over 100 jury cases in Travis County courts.""

Talk about close-to-home experience. We shifted gears to check her Travis County claim.

Montford earlier had told us she reached her total for Travis County jury trials by estimating trials she had worked on while in the Travis County DA's office, from October 1999 through the end of her tenure there in May 2008. Montford said she averaged 10 jury trials a year. ""Some years there were fewer than 10 and some years there were more than 10,"" she said.

Using Montford's claimed average, that adds up to 87 jury trials over eight years and eight months. Montford said she also had one jury trial as a lawyer in private practice, in 2009.

That brings us to 88 Travis County jury trials, short of her mailer's claim to over 100 jury trials. 
After we asked her about the mailer, Montford admitted it was in error. ""You are correct that some of our campaign literature mistakenly says that I have tried over 100 jury trials in Travis County,"" she said. ""That was an oversight and one that was never meant to mislead anyone. In every speech I have made on the trail, I have never claimed that all my jury trials were in Travis County and our Web site correctly states the information.""

On her campaign site and on other mailers, Montford's claim to over 100 jury trials does not say they were all in Travis County. 
UPDATE: After our initial post of this item Feb. 27, PolitiFact Texas came across a door hanger distributed by Montford's campaign including the statement that she'd tried over 100 cases in Travis County courts. Her consultant, Mark Littlefield, then said that 1,000 of the door hangers were printed and distributed though he said volunteers spent time marking out the Travis County trials' claim on the hangers--a cross-out that didn't appear on the hanger we fielded. Littlefield said there are no other campaign items with Montford's trials-in-Travis County claim. 
Seeking an independent count of Montford's Travis County trials, we contacted the Travis County DA’s office. Spokesman Rudy Magallanes said Montford was the first- or second-chair prosecutor in 61 trials. She topped out at 14 trials in 2000. She had her low of two trials in 2006.

Counting the single jury trial that Montford reports having as a lawyer in private practice, her confirmed jury trials in Travis County would number 62.

There’s a small wrinkle, though.

Travis County District Attorney Rosemary Lehmberg, who bested Montford in a 2008 runoff for the Democratic nomination for district attorney, vouched for the 61 Montford jury trials reflected in a list kept by the executive assistant to the first assistant district attorney. But Lehmberg said the list might be incomplete. ""There could have been more (Montford) trials that we did not write down,"" she said. 
We also checked with Harris County and compiled a list of 36 trials that had Montford as a prosecutor there. Like Lehmberg, Scott Durfee, an assistant general counsel for the Harris County District Attorney’s office, cautioned that the tabulation of trials by each attorney might be incomplete.

So how does Montford’s statement of ""over 100 jury trials"" in Travis County stand up?

As she admitted, not well; it was an erroneous mailing.

Using Montford's own annual estimate, we reached a total of 88 Travis County jury trials. The DA's list is even shorter, prompting us to presume just 62 Montford jury trials in the county. In both counts, we take Montford at her word that she handled a single jury trial as a private lawyer.

Even if the DA's office failed to count a few Montford trials, it wouldn't be enough to make her statement accurate, though Montford's trials confirmed by Travis and Harris counties plus the one she says she had in private practice add up to 98, which is close to 100.

Montford owned up; we agree her mailer was wrong. We rate her statement as False.","[(""\nE-mails, Rudy Magallanes, executive assistant to the district attorney, Travis County District Attorney’s office, Feb. 22, 2010\n\nE-mails and interview, Mindy Montford, Feb. 23, 24 and 25, 2010\n\nHarris County District Attorney's office, list of Mindy Montford trials, \nFeb. 24, 2010\n\nInterview, Scott Durfee, assistant general counsel, Harris County District Attorney's office, Feb. 23, 2010\n\nInterviews, Rosemary Lehmberg, district attorney, Travis County, Feb. 24 and 25, 2010"", 'https://alt.coxnewsweb.com/statesman/politifact/02242010_montfordharriscty.xls'), ('\nInterview, Mark Littlefield, consultant to Mindy Montford campaign, March 3, 2010', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2010/mar/03/mindy-montford/judicial-candidate-mindy-montford-says-mailer-shes/
"['Taxes', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
Crist claims largest tax cut in Florida history
","In his final State of the State address, Gov. Charlie Crist made a big claim that we've heard before. ""In our first year, we guided our state through the storm of skyrocketing property taxes and property insurance,"" Crist said March 2, 2010, in front of a joint session of the Florida Legislature. ""We worked together to enact meaningful property insurance reform and the largest tax cut in Florida history.""Crist has often touted his tax-cutting record and repeatedly said he and the Republican Legislature passed ""the largest tax cut"" in the state's history. He's made that claim in news releases, political speeches and in the first radio ad for his U.S. Senate campaign. We first put it to our Truth-O-Meter in September 2009.Here's the background:The property tax changes Crist is talking about were passed by the Legislature in 2007 and sold as the antidote to citizens' complaints that local government spending had spiraled out of control.House Bill 1B required local governments to reduce their property tax rates to 2006 levels and mandated deeper cuts based on how much a local government collected in property tax dollars. The reported savings to taxpayers: $15.6 billion over five years.House Bill 5B, meanwhile, let voters consider further property tax changes. Also known as Amendment 1, the changes — which included an additional homestead benefit, limited property value increases for non-homesteaded property and created portability for Save Our Homes — were approved by voters in January 2008. The savings: $9.3 billion over five years.Combined, that's about $25 billion in predicted property tax savings over five years.But those predictions don't jive with reality, we found.Specifically, the governor's $25 billion estimate could be accurate only if: • Property tax values increased as analysts predicted back when the tax package was passed (3 to 5 percent a year), and;• Local governments failed to reduce their tax rates. We will never know what governments would have done to their tax rates, but we do know about property tax values: They haven't gone up. They've gone down. Taxable property values dropped 15 percent in 2008, according to figures from county property appraisers. Property values dropped again in 2009 and are expected to drop in 2010. That means the governor's projections are high.And moreover, another tax cut is bigger -- Save Our Homes.Save Our Homes, an amendment to the state Constitution approved by voters in 1992, limited increases to the property value of homesteaded property in Florida. While there is debate about whether those savings were offset by people without homestead exemptions, the savings to homesteaded property owners is quantifiable.From 1996 to 2008, almost $1.9 trillion in property value went untaxed because of Save Our Homes. Using a conservative tax rate of 17 mills, that equates to $32 billion less in property taxes paid — or about $2.66 billion per year without adjusting for inflation. In 2007, the savings was about $7.27 billion and from 2004 to 2008 the estimated savings was more than $26 billion.Those numbers certainly are bigger than Crist's tax package, in reality or projection.The governor's office said it did not consider Save Our Homes when it made the claim that the Crist tax changes constitute the state's largest. Officials then provided data that showed the savings in the first years of Save Our Homes was modest. But that's because the large savings came in later years as Save Our Homes protected against increases to properties' taxable value.The Crist-led changes to Florida's property tax structure certainly required the lowering of tax rates and assessment values throughout Florida. But there are all kinds of holes in projecting the size and scope of the legislation's impact. For example: • The basis for the governor's estimate assumed a future that did not come to pass. Specifically, the governor's estimates relied on future property values continuing to increase and local governments failing to lower their property tax rate. We now know property values are decreasing.• The governor's office admitted its projections are inaccurate because of declines in property values statewide.• A state analysis concluded that the tax measures have failed to produce the savings estimated by the governor. Portability, for instance, was predicted to cut taxable property values by $11.5 billion in 2008. But it cut property values only $3.4 billion, the analysis showed. In the absence of additional data, and with the knowledge that Save Our Homes has cut property tax bills for Florida residents $32 billion or more, we find no changes since we rated this in September. We can't agree with Crist that the 2007 and 2008 changes constitute the largest tax cut in state history. We rule Crist's statement False.","[('Gov.

Crist says Floridians paying $3 billion less in property taxes
","In his annual State of the State address, Gov. Charlie Crist said Floridians are paying far less in property taxes than they used to.""Property owners were seeing double-digit percentage increases in taxes levied prior to the beginning of my administration,"" Crist said on March 2, 2010. ""Now, they have seen significant decreases over the past three years. Due to ... tax cuts and lower (property) values, 2009 property taxes were almost $3 billion below 2007 property taxes.""Previously, we rated Crist's claim that he passed the largest tax cut in Florida history. In this item, we'll focus on whether the amount of property tax relief matches Crist's description. The relevant information to back up Crist's claim comes from a Senate committee hearing last month. In the meeting, James McAdams, the Department of Revenue's property tax oversight program director, gave an update on property tax collections across Florida.According to McAdams, Florida property taxes collected between 2007 and 2009 dropped by $2.28 billion, or 7.5 percent, the Associated Press reported.McAdams was unable to delineate how much of the drop was attributed to tax reforms implemented by the Legislature, and how much was a result of falling property values.""I would classify that as dropping like a rock,"" said Senate Finance and Taxation Committee Chairman Thad Altman, R-Viera.Altman's comment prompted a response from Crist during his televised remarks in front of a joint session of the Legislature.""Sen. Altman, we agree that does, indeed, qualify as 'dropping like a rock,' "" Crist said.The Department of Revenue's 2009 annual report, meanwhile, included an even bigger reduction. The annual report said property tax collections fell from $31.04 billion in 2007, to $28.14 billion in 2009. That's a $2.9 billion decrease in three years. (See page 32 of the report).In his State of the State address, Crist said ""2009 property taxes were almost $3 billion below 2007 property taxes."" A report prepared for a Senate committee pegs the number at about $2.28 billion and the Department of Revenue's annual report pegs the number at $2.9 billion.

Crist says violent crime decreased in past three years
","During his term as governor, Charlie Crist has pushed for new legislation to crack down on criminals. Now he says that effort has paid off with a decrease in violent crime.During his State of the State speech on March 2, 2010, Crist told a joint session of the Legislature: ""With your help, during the first three years of my administration we made Florida a much safer place for our most vulnerable citizens. You enacted the Anti-Murder Act and improved the Jessica Lunsford Act, striking back at violent criminals and sexual predators of children. Fellow Floridians, I am happy to report we are now seeing a decrease in violent crime.""To examine crime rates since he took office in January 2007, we turned to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement Uniform Crime Reports.

That's clearly a decrease, and matches a nationwide decline.For the first six months of 2009, the FDLE's semi-annual uniform crime reports showed a 9.7 percent drop in violent crime compared to 2008.The FBI's state-by-state report in 2008, ""Crime in the United States,"" also showed drops in the violent crime rate in Florida per 100,000 people though with slightly different numbers: 722.6 in 2007 to 688.9 in 2008. We are not addressing whether the laws Florida legislators passed directly led to a lower violent crime rate -- that's often a matter of debate among criminal justice experts.

Bill Nelson says state costs 'fully reimbursable' by FEMA in event of disaster
","
Republican Gov. Rick Scott and Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson recently sparred about the impact of sequestration on the Florida National Guard. 
Tropical Storm Andrea’s arrival in early June prompted Scott to write Nelson and U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, urging them to work with the Department of Defense to spare civilian guard employees from pay cuts as a result of the automatic spending cuts agreed to by President Barack Obama and Congress. 
About 1,000 employees of the Florida National Guard must take a furlough day each week starting July 8 to Sept. 30, the end of the federal budget year. The support employees repair planes and vehicles, provide medical services and handle duties such as public affairs and human relations. 
""These forced cuts to guardsmen not only immediately result in lost income for Florida guard families, they also force the state to spend state tax dollars to make up for days of emergency functions, which could have been avoided if not for the Department of Defense cuts,"" Scott said. 
Rubio told a Gannett reporter there wasn’t much he could do to avoid the sequester without raising taxes. Nelson responded with his own letter, saying it was too late to redo the cuts with just four months left in the fiscal year. 
Nelson said he consulted the legal team of the Federal Emergency Management Administration about Scott’s concerns. 
""Regarding your concern about increased costs to the state, let me share with you what I have received from the legal office of FEMA Director Craig Fugate. If you as governor activate the National Guard in anticipation of a federal disaster, the state’s costs, including the costs to recall any furloughed guardsmen, will be fully reimbursable by FEMA,"" Nelson wrote. 
Nelson then quoted from FEMA, which said that ""under a Presidential disaster declaration, FEMA reimburses the State (Grantee), subject to the State cost-share, for costs in excess of those incurred for weekend drills and annual training and other non-disaster related activations."" 
Scott wasn’t satisfied with Nelson’s response (saying nothing of Rubio’s). He enlisted his top emergency management official to write Nelson, saying his claim that the ""state’s costs, including the costs to recall any furloughed guardsmen, will be fully reimbursable by FEMA,"" runs counter to recent history. 
We wanted to look at Nelson’s claim since the Scott administration deemed it factually problematic. 
Let’s say a potentially crazy storm is heading to Florida. What’s a governor to do? 
In order for FEMA to be involved, Scott must declare a state of emergency. If the situation is more than local and state resources can handle, the governor then requests the president issue an emergency declaration. FEMA reviews the request and makes a recommendation to the president. 
FEMA has limitations on what it can do for a state without a presidential declaration. 
""One of those is, it’s not going to pay the guard,"" said Ernest Abbott, who served as FEMA’s general counsel during President Bill Clinton’s second term. Now he runs a private practice specializing in FEMA law. 
Presidential emergency declarations are made ahead of a threat, such as prior to a hurricane’s landfall. Florida has had 12. They are meant to supplement local and state efforts for some activities, such as evacuations. 
Disaster declarations, of which Florida has had 65, are issued by the president after a catastrophic event, usually per the governor’s request. 
If the president makes a declaration, FEMA then decides which area is eligible for federal relief and which programs are appropriate. 
The federal share of assistance is always at least 75 percent, according to FEMA. That’s been the norm for Florida in recent years. 
Florida has not received 100 percent reimbursement for a major disaster declaration since 2005, when FEMA covered expenses for hurricanes Wilma, Dennis and Katrina, according to the state Division of Emergency Management. 
For the state’s nine disasters since 2007, the federal government paid between 75 and 80 percent, according to the Florida Division of Emergency Management. That includes severe storms and tornadoes in 2007, two days of damage for Tropical Storm Fay in 2008, Hurricanes Ike and Gustav in 2008, flooding in north Florida in 2009, and Tropical Storm Debby and Hurricane Isaac in 2012. 
Even though the feds paid for most of the costs, they did not pay for all of them. 
There is a possibility FEMA could pick up the entire tab for debris removal and emergency protective work for a three-day period, which happened eight times during the state's busy hurricane seasons in 2004 and 2005. 
FEMA’s legal team assured Nelson that recalling furloughed workers for an emergency would be subject to the federal and state cost-sharing, according to his letter to Scott. But the Scott administration said much is unknown because the sequester is such a new animal. 
""Will FEMA reimburse us for two additional days? We don’t know what’s going to happen,"" said Glenn Sutphin, legislative affairs director for the Florida Department of Military Affairs. 
FEMA told us what it told Nelson, that it reimburses a state at a cost-share for emergency work  done on top of non-disaster activities like annual training and weekend drills (so long as a declaration is issued). 
The problem is: Nelson didn’t say it that precisely in his letter. He said the state’s National Guard expenses would be ""fully reimbursable."" 
Fully, to us and the dictionary,means completely. But that’s not a sure thing. 
Florida is not guaranteed a federal reimbursement of any amount if Scott activates the National Guard ahead of a storm. He needs a presidential declaration. Further, the reimbursement is rarely full; the federal government most often shares 75 percent of the costs. 
We rate Nelson’s statement Mostly False.","[('\nGov. Rick Scott’s letter to Sens.

Sen. Sherrod Brown says lawmakers who take farm subsidies would cut food stamps
","
Congress is deciding whether to reform the nation’s farm subsidy system and, while it is at it, will probably cut the amount it dedicates to food stamps for the poor and low-income workers. Both programs are part of what’s known as the farm bill, the five-year authorization that sets the terms for government crop assistance and defines eligibility for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP. 
It turns out that some Congress members receive farm subsidies themselves, or get them through farms and corporations they and their relatives own. Whether they should or shouldn’t is not for us to say. Proponents and opponents of the subsidies, primarily direct payments made to farm owners, can be found in both political parties. 
But U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, an Ohio Democrat, finds it disconcerting that some of the lawmakers who gladly take the government’s subsidies want to cut SNAP, or subsidies to people who need help buying groceries. Discussing the 2013 farm bill, which recently passed in the Senate and is under debate in the House, Brown told reporters on a conference call on June 12, ""There's a lot of pressure in the House of Representatives to just emasculate the SNAP program. For whatever reason, some of these members of the House of Representatives get hundreds of thousands of dollars in farm subsidies. They think they earned that, and on the other hand, then they want to cut food stamps, and I think that's morally wrong."" 
We cannot read the minds of subsidy recipients, so we will not judge whether Congress members -- who earn $174,000 federal salaries -- think they have earned the right to farm  subsidies. But Brown’s claim struck us as worth examining. 
Examples were easy to find. The Environmental Working Group, or EWG, an advocacy and research group, maintains a database of federal farm subsidies and has run lawmakers’ names to see what they or their families are getting. News organizations have used this database (and the public can, too), and some have noted where the recipients stand on food stamps, or SNAP. For instance: 
* Rep. Steve Fincher of Tennessee, ""who supports billions of dollars in cuts to the food stamp program,"" is ""one of the largest recipients of federal farm subsidies, according to new annual data released by a Washington environmental group."" This was in the New York Times on May 22. Fincher, from Frog Jump, Tenn., and his wife ""collected nearly $3.5 million in subsidies from 1999 to 2012,"" reported the Times, using EWG data. In 2012 alone, the couple received about $70,000 in direct payments, which is ""money that is given to farmers and farmland owners, even if they do not grow crops,"" the Times wrote. 
During debate in May on whether to cut $20.5 billion from SNAP over the next 10 years, Fincher, a Republican, said, ""We have to remember there is not a big printing press in Washington that continually prints money over and over. This is other people’s money that Washington is appropriating and spending."" 
* Rep. Doug LaMalfa of California and his wife, Jill, together own one third of DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership, which in 2012 alone got $188,570 in direct farm payments from the federal government, according to the EWG. That would put last year’s subsidies to LaMalfa and his wife at $62,857. But going back to 1995, the DSL LaMalfa Family Partnership has received  $5.13 million, which would put the share of Rep. LaMalfa and his wife at $1.7 million, EWG said. 
In May, LaMalfa won a House amendment that would require electronic fraud prevention measures and eliminate bonus pay for signing up new SNAP recipients. He said in a statement then, ""The success of the food stamp program should be measured by how many Americans become self-sufficient, not how many are added to the rolls."" 
* Rep. Marlin Stutzman of Indiana has received $196,268 in farm subsidies since 1997, according to the EWG. 
Stutzman, a Republican, recently proposed cutting SNAP by $30 billion over 10 years, deeper than the $20.5 billion now on the table, saying, ""Everyone in Washington talks about deficit reduction but we’ve introduced a real, responsible plan to save taxpayer dollars. Over the past decade, SNAP spending has doubled as this program outgrows its original mission of providing temporary assistance."" 
The list goes on. The Wall Street Journal and Bloomberg, both reviewing the same EWG data as other media, noted that 15 members of Congress got farm subsidies in 2012. (None were from Ohio.) Thirteen were Republicans and two were Democrats. The Democrats were in the Senate -- Michael Bennett of Colorado and Jon Tester of Montana, who says he is the Senate’s only ""working farmer."" Both voted June 10 for the Senate version of the farm bill, which would cut SNAP by $4 billion, or about $16 billion less than the House GOP leaders want. Brown, too, voted for the bill after failing to get the SNAP cut restored. 
It’s fairly obvious where this leaves Brown’s claim that some House members accepted ""hundreds of thousands of dollars"" in farm subsidies but are eager to cut food stamps. 
But before ruling, we’ll note in fairness that some of the farm-subsidy recipients told the Wall Street Journal that the farm programs need reform, too. Fincher issued a statement saying, ""I voted immediately to remove direct payments,"" the Journal wrote. And, the Journal added, a spokesman for LaMalfa said the lawmaker has long opposed the farm-subsidy system and voted to end direct payments. 
In Stutzman’s case, the receipt of subsidies was a political issue in his 2010 election. But he maintained to the Fort Wayne Journal Gazette that the farm-support system is like a mandate, giving him no choice. The farmer ""has to take it,"" he told the Journal Gazette in 2010. 
The U.S. Department of Agriculture said the program is voluntary. 
OK, so maybe he and the others didn’t like it one bit when they got farm subsidies. We’re not here to judge their motives. But we are here to judge Brown’s claim. It is True.","[('\nSen.

Saxby Chambliss says U.S. has ""never stood by and seen innocent people slaughtered"" as in Syria
","
Last week, the United States announced that it was convinced that the Syrian regime led by Bashar al-Assad had used chemical weapons, thus crossing a line set by President Barack Obama that would trigger U.S. involvement in the three-year-long rebellion and resulting civil war. 
On CNN’s The Situation Room, Sen. Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., made the case for U.S. involvement in Syria. Chambliss serves as vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee. 
""The United States has never stood by and seen innocent people slaughtered to the extent that's happening in Syria,"" Chambliss said. ""The United States does not need to be the world's policeman, but the United States does need to step in when tyrants like this, really, in a very militant way, kill innocent people on a regular basis."" 
We wondered: Is there a precedent for the United States failing to intervene in the slaughter of innocents on a scale as large as, or larger than, the conflict in Syria? 
The first part of answering this question is to determine how many people have been killed in Syria. As in the case of most conflicts, estimating the number of deaths tends to be imprecise. However, an office of the United Nations reported this month that the death toll in Syria reached at least 93,000 by the end of April. 
Of course, the United States has combated, in one way or another, cases of mass civilian deaths, including World War II Japan, North Korea during the Korean War, the former Yugoslavia, Saddam Hussein’s Iraq, and Taliban-led Afghanistan. 
A spokeswoman for Chambliss said the senator was referring to ""tragedies like Bosnia, where the United States had full knowledge of the abuses occurring, and had the ability and resources to intervene. The United States now has confirmation that Assad used chemical weapons on his own people, and so appropriate action must be taken."" 
But there are numerous examples in which the U.S. had initelligence about mass killings and chose not to intervene. 
The most obvious example of a genocide not directly challenged by the United States, of course, is the Holocaust. ""You need search no further"" to debunk Chambliss’ comment than the genocide of European Jewry, said Debórah Dwork, director of the Strassler Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies at Clark University. All told, Nazi Germany ""deliberately killed about 11 million noncombatants, a figure that rises to more than 12 million if foreseeable deaths from deportation, hunger, and sentences in concentration camps are included,"" Timothy Snyder, a Yale historian, has written. 
The United States fought Nazi Germany in World War II, of course. The U.S. government had a pretty good idea what was going on by at least April 1943, when the U.S. and the United Kingdom called a conference in Bermuda to discuss refugees amid growing public urgings to save Jewish populations in Europe, Dwork said. But the parties to the conference essentially sidestepped the question, and diverting military assets to directly challenge the infrastructure of the Holocaust remained off the Allies’ agenda until the war ended in 1945. 
There are other examples -- lots of them. While politics and historical uncertainty makes it impossible to create a perfect list, there are quite a few examples that would seem to undercut Chambliss’ claim. 
• Communist China. While the United States was hardly friendly toward Mao Zedong’s China prior to President Richard Nixon’s rapprochement in the 1970s, the U.S. didn’t directly intervene when millions in China were killed in such government programs as the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. Frank Dikötter, a Hong Kong-based historian, told the British newspaper The Independent that in just the four-year period between 1958 and 1962, at least 45 million people were worked, starved or beaten to death. Measuring a longer period, the death toll would surely be higher. 
• The Soviet Union. As for the United States’ World War II ally, Snyder estimates that a variety of policies under Josef Stalin -- including the elimination of relatively prosperous peasants known as ""kulaks,"" ethnic cleansing, preventable famine and political purges -- resulted in the deliberate killing of 6 million noncombatants and the preventable deaths of an additional 3 million. 
• Cambodia. Dictator Pol Pot, leader of the Khmer Rouge, is believed to have killed approximately 2 million people between 1975 and 1979 through execution, starvation and disease. 
• The Armenian genocide. The widespread killing of Armenians in the Ottoman empire starting in 1915 is hotly contested historical turf between Armenians and present-day Turks, but the University of Minnesota’s Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies has estimated that a total of 1.5 million Armenians died over the course of several years. 
• Ethiopia. Ethiopian dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam is blamed for as many as 500,000 deaths as a result of his ""red terror"" political campaign in 1977 and 1978, according to Amnesty International. A subsequent famine, for which he is at least partially blamed, claimed the lives of an estimated 1 million. 
• Biafra. From 1967 to 1970, Nigeria went to war against the breakaway state of Biafra. The war, combined with a resulting famine, may have claimed 1 million people. 
• Rwanda. In just 100 days, perhaps 1 million ethnic Tutsis and moderate Hutus were killed in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Earlier this year, former President Bill Clinton told CNBC that if his own administration had acted sooner, 300,000 lives might have been saved -- an enormous regret for the former president that led to the creation of his nonprofit foundation. ""If we'd gone in sooner, I believe we could have saved at least a third of the lives that were lost,"" he said in the interview. ""It had an enduring impact on me."" 
• Uganda. During his rule from 1971 to 1979, Ugandan dictator Idi Amin is blamed for between 300,000 and 500,000 deaths. 
• Darfur. Over the course of a decade, Sudanese government attacks in the southwestern region of Darfur led to the deaths of an estimated 300,000 people. 
• Liberia. Liberian Dictator Charles Taylor and the wars he started are blamed for the deaths of more than 300,000 people. 
• Bangladesh. The war that led to the creation of Bangladesh in 1971 -- previously a geographically isolated portion of Pakistan -- led to the deaths of 269,000 people, according to a study in the British Medical Journal. 
• Burundi. Ethnic violence starting in 1993 led to the deaths of about 200,000 people in Burundi. 
All in all, Chambliss’ statement ""is clearly incorrect,"" said Herbert Hirsch, a political scientist who specializes in genocide at Virginia Commonwealth University. 
Indeed, the list above is not comprehensive. University of Hawaii political scientist R.J. Rummel lists no fewer than 219 cases between 1900 and 1987. 
""While I definitely do not endorse Rummel’s entire catalog, his basic point is surely sound: Government-led or government-caused slaughter has been a good deal more lethal than traditional state-on-state war,"" said Ted R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Heritage Foundation. ""I would therefore not be able to agree with Sen. Chambliss's statement."" 
Bromund and Brookings Institution senior fellow Michael O’Hanlon did agree, however, that the decision on whether to intervene in Syria needs to be made on its own merits, not decided by adherence to the United States’ track record. 
""There are many cases where we’ve stood by with much larger death tolls,"" O’Hanlon said. ""But that doesn’t really justify inaction in Syria."" 
Then again, ""adopting a rule to intervene against all and any regime that kills innocents on a regular basis would mean getting involved in numerous countries around the globe,"" said Robert Gellately, a historian at Florida State University. ""Rushing into a hot conflict like the one in Syria does not appear to be prudent at this stage."" 
Our ruling 
Chambliss said, ""The United States has never stood by and seen innocent people slaughtered to the extent that's happening in Syria."" That claim is undercut by myriad examples in which more than 100,000 civilians were killed yet the United States did not take direct and significant action.

Corporate tax holiday has benefits, Isakson says
","
In recent years, Republicans have been vocal about one particular way they say the federal government is anti-business. 
One of their main complaints is the U.S. has the highest corporate tax rate in the world, a claim the PolitiFact franchise has repeatedly fact-checked with mixed reviews since the Truth-O-Meter started. U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Ga., was talking about the high corporate tax rates during a recent interview when he was asked whether there should a corporate tax holiday on off-shore profits? His answer piqued our interest. 
""Absolutely,"" he told Bloomberg radio. ""It was done by John Kennedy. It was done by George W. Bush. Both times they did it, it brought back trillions or billions of dollars back into the United States which got reinvested in businesses and in jobs, and that’s exactly what we should do with the over $2 trillion that’s stranded now."" 
PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out whether the senator’s claim that corporate tax holidays pushed by those two presidents brought ""billions of dollars back into the United States."" 
Some elected officials push a particular idea by saying a political icon on the other side of the aisle supported a similar approach. President Barack Obama, a Democrat, has asked for support of various policies by saying Republican Ronald Reagan advocated fairly identical ideas. 
In this case, Isakson brought up the name of one of the most popular Democrats in U.S. history, JFK. 
We asked Isakson’s office for more details to back up their argument concerning Kennedy, who was president from January 1961 to November 1963, when he was assassinated. It took them a few days, but their argument was based on: 
Kennedy’s role in creating the Investment Tax Credit, which they said reduced corporate taxes significantly. 
Internal Revenue Code subpart F, which prevented the deferral of taxes owed by U.S.-controlled foreign corporations on untaxed income before being distributed to shareholders in the United States. 
Those proposals were passed in 1962. 
Economists and historians say Kennedy wanted these changes because he was concerned about the flow of money out of the United States and its impact on the gold standard. 
Kennedy took a multilayered approach to the economy, experts say. He proposed a tax cut, saying the top rate of 91 percent was way too high and deterred consumer spending. The tax cut plan did not pass until after his death, which was tweaked by Kennedy’s successor, Lyndon Johnson. 
""President Kennedy realized that high taxation could have harmful effects on the economy, and he acted to bring such high taxes down,"" Isakson’s office said via email. ""President Kennedy enacted some very significant U.S. international tax reforms. The combined effect of President Kennedy’s tax legislation is often seen as having a positive impact on the U.S. economy."" 
David Shreve has taught courses on economic history at the University of Virginia and closely studied Kennedy administration economic policies. Shreve, currently a research analyst at the university's Weldon Cooper Center for Public Service, explained via email that the Kennedy changes were ""the polar OPPOSITE of a tax holiday."" 
Through our research, we found little describing the changes to the code as a corporate tax holiday. 
Now, to the Bush corporate tax holiday. 
In October 2004, Congress passed what was called the most sweeping corporate tax legislation in a generation. The 650-page bill included a provision allowing companies with vast stores of offshore revenue to bring them home under a discount tax rate of 5.25 percent. 
Did it result in billions of dollars returning to the United States that were reinvested in jobs and businesses? 
The Internal Revenue Service reported that a small number of mostly large corporations repatriated nearly $362 billion from their controlled foreign corporations as a result of the 2004 holiday. 
In early 2011, Obama announced he would not pursue a similar type of tax holiday. The decision sparked all sorts of analyses of the 2004 tax holiday. There were many questions about its results. 
""Unfortunately, there is no evidence that it increased U.S. investment or jobs, and it cost taxpayers billions,"" Assistant U.S. Treasury Department Secretary for Tax Policy Michael Mundaca wrote on the department’s website in March 2011. 
A May 2011 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service concluded another tax holiday similar to what was done in 2004 would have positive short-term results, but it raised questions about the holiday’s long-term effectiveness. 
The conservative Heritage Foundation posted an article in 2011 that concluded the 2004 tax holiday produced immediate results but ""the evidence is clear that these repatriations did not produce the hoped-for subsequent surge in domestic investment."" The article suggested the U.S. lower its corporate tax rate and a permanent partial exemption for future foreign-source earnings of all U.S. businesses. 
To sum up, Isakson’s comments were accurate about the Bush tax holiday, which brought $362 billion back into the U.S. There is, however, disagreement about its long-term effectiveness.  There is even more disagreement about whether it’s correct to describe what Kennedy did as a corporate tax holiday.

Medicare fraud rate is 8 to 10 percent, says Roskam of Illinois
","Fraud by its very nature tries to hide from view. So when Rep. Peter Roskam, R-Ill., talked about how big the problem is for the Medicare program, he gave himself some wiggle room. Roskam was talking to Fox News about a bill he has that would borrow tools used in the credit card industry to pare down the tens of billions of dollars that criminal gangs and unscrupulous operators pocket from the federal government’s health care program for the elderly. ""Worldwide credit card transactions, the credit card fraud rate is 0.04 percent,"" Roskam told Fox News. ""Compared to almost 8 percent, 9 percent, 10 percent of Medicare fraud."" When PolitiFact checked the size of Medicare fraud five years ago, we quickly discovered that hard and fast numbers are hard to come by. In this fact-check, we’ll examine Roskam’s estimate of 8 to 10 percent and see what sources he relies on. Before we dive into Medicare fraud, a review of credit card studies shows that Roskam is pretty much on the mark when he speaks of a 0.04 percent rate. A 2010 report from the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City gives a fraud rate of 0.05 percent for U.S. issued cards, both debit and credit. Roskam’s office pointed us to a trade publication, the Nilson Report, that cites an international rate of 0.04 percent rate. On Medicare, Roskam’s office cited a Government Accountability Office report, a watchdog website created by an executive order from President Barack Obama, and an article from the U.S. Administration on Aging. All three give us rates that range from 7.9 percent to 8.5 percent for the largest Medicare program, and up to 11 percent for a smaller program, Medicare Advantage. While the fraud rates fall into Roskam’s range, none of them is talking about fraud alone. Rather, they address the much broader category of improper payments. If a doctor orders too many tests, or provides a service but submits the wrong payment code, those come under the umbrella of improper payments. Out and out fraud is not as large as improper payments, but it can be egregious. The FBI recently charged 25 people in Miami for allegedly bribing Medicare beneficiaries and then using their account numbers to bill for services that were unnecessary or never provided. The government says the scheme netted the conspirators about $44 million. Malcolm Sparrow, professor of public management and a specialist in corruption control at Harvard’s Kennedy School, told us that fraud and improper payments are far from identical. ""There is a serious problem with conflating these different types of overpayment,"" Sparrow said. ""They are quite different in origin and require very different types of control mechanisms."" When we raised this with Roskam’s office, his staff sent us several examples where Roskam has spoken collectively of fraud, waste and abuse. On Fox News, however, he spoke only of fraud. PolitiFact also found a study that restores a measure of credibility to Roskam’s estimate. Donald Berwick, a former head of the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services or CMS, the agency that runs Medicare, collaborated with an analyst at RAND to produce a landmark paper in 2012 in JAMA, the Journal of the American Medical Association. That paper offers three estimates of fraud in the Medicare and Medicaid programs: a low of 3 percent, a medium of 6 percent and a high of 10 percent. CMS told us they have no official estimate of fraud but pointed us to this study, and they cited FBI figures that mirror the numbers in this paper. If it turns out that the high end of the range in the JAMA article is correct, then Roskam is in the right ballpark. Of course, nobody knows for sure because fraud is a crime, and criminals don’t advertise their work. Two caveats for policy makers The JAMA article doesn’t stop at Medicare and Medicaid. It also looks at fraud in the health care sector as a whole, both public and private. The fraud rates don’t change much when the private sector is included. For Sparrow at Harvard, this is no surprise. ""The systems and structures they use for control are the same, across public, private, and not-for-profit programs,"" Sparrow said. ""They all tend to share the same strengths and weaknesses, and are roughly equally vulnerable."" Put another way, the nature of the American health care system lends itself to a certain level of fraud, and the Medicare program is no more and no less susceptible to this type of crime. Sparrow says this also suggests the comparison to the credit card industry might be less useful than might appear. In the first place, the transactions are much simpler. When a thief tries a scam with a credit card, the card holder tends to notice by the next bill. In general, this kind of fraud is more easily detected and tracked. But Sparrow says there’s a bigger difference. ""The losses are borne by banks,"" he said. That creates a powerful incentive, in real time, to control the problem. In health care, the incentives are ""more diffuse and ambiguous."" Our ruling Roskam said the Medicare fraud rate is 8 to 10 percent. His office pointed us to various documents that analyzed the problem of improper payments, an issue that mixes fraud together with nominally legal activities such as referring patients for more tests than are necessary. This suggested Roskam was using an inflated estimate of fraud. However, a recent study tends, in the worst-case analysis, to support Roskam’s figures. Roskam’s comparison to credit cards overlooks many key differences between the structures of the health care and credit card industries, and it tends to obscure the systematic nature of fraud in health care, whether public or private. But Roskam is right that credit card fraud is a tiny percentage of all transactions. We rate the statement Mostly True.","[('Fox News, Transcript, June 12, 2013', 'http://cq.com/doc/newsmakertranscripts-4293988'), ('Email interview, Meagan Holder, spokesperson for Rep.

Rollingwood mayor says Rolling Stones donated $25,000 to city for inconvenience of Zilker Park concert
","
Barry Bone says private interests that profit from occupying Austin’s Zilker Park for concerts should routinely compensate Rollingwood, a 1-square-mile city on the other side of MoPac Boulevard (Loop 1) from the park. 
Bone, the city’s mayor, declared in an opinion column published in the June 13, 2013, edition of the weekly Westlake Picayune that C3, the promoters behind the annual Austin City Limits Music Festival, had rebuffed his request that it pay $150,000 to Rollingwood ""for six nights of disruption, plus expenses, to compensate our city for the festival."" 
Bone added: ""When the Rolling Stones rolled through a few years back, they paid us $25,000 for one night of inconvenience."" 
Talk about satisfaction. 
Did the Stones really pony up? 
We took our first cue from a Feb. 8, 2007, Austin American-Statesman news story stating the Stones’ October 2006 concert resulted in about $300,000 in proceeds going toward beautifying neighborhood parks and Zilker Park. The plans, the story said, were announced by the Austin Parks Foundation, which was described as intending to award the money as grants. 
""Half of it will be spent on improving smaller parks in the Barton Hills, Zilker, Bouldin Creek, Old West Austin, West Austin and Rollingwood neighborhoods,"" the story said, with the remaining $150,000 devoted to the park’s irrigation system. 
Spread $150,000 evenly among six neighborhoods and it comes to $25,000 each. 
But that’s indirect guidance; we sought definitive evidence. By email, Bone guided us to Abel Campos, a city accountant, who emailed us a copy of a $25,000 check, dated Jan. 12, 2007, made out to the city by the parks foundation. Campos also shared a March 20, 2007, letter to the city from Charlie McCabe, then the foundation's executive director, stating the money reflected proceeds from the Rolling Stones concert. 
Our ruling 
Bone said the Rolling Stones gave $25,000 to Rollingwood after the band performed at Zilker Park. That’s the amount of money that flowed through the Austin Parks Foundation to the city described as proceeds from the big show.

Morgan Griffith says GAO estimates Obamacare will add $6.2 trillion to long-term deficits
","
U.S. Rep. Morgan Griffith says Obamacare will be a drag on the nation’s budget for decades to come. 
""The Government Accountability Office estimated that it will add to the long-term deficit by $6.2 trillion,"" Griffith, R-9th, said in a May 16 news release. 
That eye-popping number, which has been repeated by other Republicans and conservative organizations critical of the health care law, caught our attention. So we checked whether the GAO report really did say the law would put the U.S. another $6.2 trillion into the red. 
Griffith spokesman Andrea Pivarunas pointed us to a GAO report released in January. The study, requested by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., examined Obamacare’s potential effect on the country’s ""primary deficit"" -- the gap between spending and revenues that leaves out interest payments on the national debt. 
The GAO analyzed two vastly different scenarios on Obamacare’s budgetary impact over the next 75 years. 
One scenario assumed the law would remain intact and that all of its provisions to slow the growth of federal healthcare spending work as intended. In this rosy case, the GAO found that the nation’s deficit, when compared to its Gross Domestic Product, would decrease by 1.5 percent over 75 years. 
There are good reasons to question whether things will pan out that way. 
Medicare’s trustees, the CBO and the Office of the Chief Actuary have questioned whether Obamacare’s costs containment measures for healthcare can be sustained over the long term. The law is based on assumptions that mandated productivity gains in health care will spur providers to cut costs. But what happens if the productivity goals are not attainable? 
To answer that question, the GAO considered a second scenario in which Obamacare’s mandates for expanding health care coverage remained intact, but all of its cost containment measures are phased out starting in 2019. 
Under that gloomy setting, the report said the nation’s deficit, when compared to GDP, would increase by 0.7 percent over 75 years. 
We couldn’t find the $6.2 trillion figure Griffith cited anywhere in the report. There was a good reason why. 
""We did not make such an estimate,"" emailed Susan Irving, a GAO analyst who co-authored report. 
The deficit number was computed by Republican staff members on the Senate Budget Committee, where Sessions is the ranking member. The aides compiled the total value country’s GDP over 75 years using data from the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. 
Those figures show GDP is expected to total $883 trillion between 2011 and 2085. Running that number through the GAO report, 1.5 percent of GDP over 75 years would come to $13.25 trillion. That would be the savings under the rosy scenario. 
On the other hand, 0.7 percent of GDP over 75 years would total $6.2 trillion. That would be the increased debt under the gloomy scenario. 
Griffith, in his statement, only mentions the bad scenario. 
But Irving, the GAO analyst, told us the report does not say whether one outcome or the other is more likely. The study, in fact, states that Obamacare’s long-range impact on the budget ""depends"" on whether the cost containment measures work, which is unknown. 
Christopher Conover, an adjunct scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, wrote in a recent web post that the gloomy scenario is a more realistic for two reasons:1) the cost containment measures may not work and, if they do; 2) Congress will not have not have the political will to continue reforms that become unpopular. 
Josh Gordon, policy director at the centrist Concord Coalition, said it’s a ""meaningless critique"" to judge the health care reform law by that $6.2 trillion figure. 
""It’s always good to know the worst case scenario, but it doesn’t make sense to criticize a piece of legislation for the worst case scenario,"" said Gordon, whose group advocates deficit reduction. ""The worst case scenario is not what’s enacted."" 
Gordon said although there are concerns that some of the containment measures may not work, ""that’s very different than saying all of them at once will not work and thus the deficit will increase by ‘X’ amount."" 
Henry Aaron, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who supports Obamacare, was perplexed by Griffith’s statement. ""Why one would say that the (health care reform law) is unbalanced because one runs estimates of a program that differs from the (health care reform law) escapes me entirely,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
Griffith said the GAO estimated Obamacare will add $6.2 trillion to deficits over the next 75 years. 
That figure isn’t in the GAO report that Griffith’s office cited. Republicans came up with the number by adding reasonable computations to a worst-case scenario laid out by the GAO early this year.

Common Core opponent goes too far with claim about data collection
","
The Common Core State Standards have become a hot-button issue in some areas of metro Atlanta. Opponents run the gamut: state lawmakers, conservative groups, tea party members, parents and some school board members. 
Many see adoption of the standards as a backdoor way for the federal government  to implement a national curriculum and take away local control of education. 
A self-described citizen activist from Fayette County, Angela Bean, has been one of the opposition leaders, and she has taken the anti-Common Core message on the road to various school and community meetings. In a newspaper article this month, Bean -- who is also an executive board member of the Fayette County Republican Party -- identifies another reason for hating Common Core: 
There are concerns about the longitudinal data system that goes along with Common Core, Bean told The Newnan Times-Herald. The system is designed to collect up to 400 data points on each child, which can include personally identifiable data. 
Does Common Core allow for this amount of extensive data collection? And, if so, what data is being collected? We checked with the initiative’s founders for more information. 
Common Core refers to a set of national education standards adopted by 45 states, the District of Columbia and two U.S. territories. The standards were created after years of discussion by private nonprofit education groups and state education departments, and they are designed to better prepare students for college and careers, and ensure that students in all states learn the same academic concepts in the same grades. 
The Obama administration has used its education funding grant process to encourage states to adhere to the new standards, but no state is required to adhere to Common Core. 
Georgia’s state Board of Education adopted Common Core performance standards on July 8, 2010. And the standards rolled out in school districts during the 2012-2013 school year, said Dorie Turner Nolt, a spokeswoman for the Georgia Department of Education. 
We checked with the Council of Chief State School Officers, a national organization of public officials who head state education departments, and one of the founders of the Common Core standards, about Bean’s data collection claim. Organization officials said there are no data collection requirements with Common Core, and they address the issue on its website. 
""States are still responsible as they were previously to report their accountability (on tests and other student assessments), but Common Core doesn’t add any new data reporting, said Margaret Millar, the CCSSO’s director of membership services. 
Kathleen Porter-Magee, an education expert at the Thomas B. Fordham Institute who has studied Common Core, agreed that there are no requirements for any sort of data collection or data mining. 
""If a state chooses to collect achievement data, that is a decision the state chooses to make,"" she said. ""But is is not lumped in with Common Core."" 
So, if Common Core doesn’t have a data collection component, or require data collection, has Georgia decided to collect data independently? 
Turner Nolt, with the Georgia Education Department, initially responded to Bean’s statements in another article, also printed in The Newnan Times-Herald. In that response, Turner Nolt refutes the claims that Georgia is participating in a data collection system, known as inBloom. That system is one of several education data collection systems, but it is not aligned with Common Core, state and and national experts maintain. (Some individual Georgia school districts are participating in inBloom. We reached out to company officials for specifics but did not receive a response by press time) 
The state Education Department does collect student data annually and makes that data available in a user-friendly format for teachers and other school officials in its Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems (SLDS) Grant Program. The system is available for access by every public school district in the state. There are currently more than 65,000 teachers using the system. 
The system collects data points in about 10 categories, Robert Swiggum, the state department’s chief information officer, said in an email to us about the SLDS data program. The categories include: a student’s name, grade, gender, ethnicity, birth date, attendance, enrollment history, test scores, courses taken and grade received, and any subgroup (example: English language learner, retained, economically disadvantaged). 
Each of the categories has dozens of data points that can vary depending on how many tests each student takes, those test scores, the number of courses taken and the length of time a student has been in school. 
Turner Nolt said the data in the state’s SLDS system has been collected for years, but that the information is now computerized. The systems does collect personally identifiable data, as Bean claimed, but the information is not shared beyond the student’s teachers and school administrators, Turner Nolt said. 
To sum up, Bean claimed a data system companion of Common Core collects up to 400 data points on each child, which can include personally identifiable data. 
Bean’s claim incorrectly intertwines Common Core and a data collection system. Our research found that Common Core does not include a data collection component. Georgia’s Education Department does collect student data as part of a separate annual collection cycle, then provides the information in a digital format for teachers and school officials to use. 
Bean’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts about the separation of Common Core and data collection.

Steve Sweeney says 70 percent of New Jerseyans want marriage equality
","
There’s no denying that support for same-sex marriage has grown in New Jersey during the past few years. 
Polls done on the issue show that support for it has climbed above 50 percent and is nearing a two-thirds majority, according to recent results released by a handful of major polling organizations. 
The consenus is so strong, according to Senate President Steve Sweeney (D-Gloucester), that New Jersey may be headed toward a number indicating support from three-quarters of state residents. 
""Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality,"" Sweeney said during an interview earlier this month on NJTV’s ‘On The Record with Michael Aron.’ Sweeney, who abstained when a same-sex marriage bill came before the Legislature three years ago, now supports it. 
The 70 percent figure would be the highest level of support for same-sex marriage ever polled in New Jersey – if it were true. But it’s not. 
Let’s begin by reviewing polls done in New Jersey on same-sex marriage. 
Back in April, the Rutgers-Eagleton poll asked 819 registered voters if they would vote for legalizing same-sex marriage if the question appeared on a ballot. Of those who answered, 62 percent said yes, 30 percent said no and 8 percent were undecided, said David Redlawsk, director of the Rutgers-Eagleton Polling Institute and a political science professor at Rutgers University. 
The poll had a margin of error of +/- 3.7 percent. 
We then checked with the Quinnipiac Polling Institute, which had a slightly higher approval rating for this question asked in March: Would you support or oppose a law that would allow same-sex couples to get married? 
The poll found 64 percent of registered voters in favor, the highest level Quinnipiac has seen in response to that exact question since 2006, when support was at 41 percent. Thirty percent were opposed. 
The same poll found that 72 percent of New Jerseyans say it’s a good idea to decide the same-sex marriage issue by referendum on the November ballot. 
Let’s be clear: Sweeney’s claim of 70 percent support only rings true when voters are asked if same-sex marriage should go on the ballot. Favorability for same-sex marriage is closer to 60 percent when voters are asked if they would support laws allowing it. 
Quinnipiac’s poll surveyed 1,129 registered voters and had a margin of error of +/-2.9 percent. 
The Monmouth University Poll also has polled on this topic and seen numbers near 60 percent that support same-sex marriage, with favorability increasing each year. 
""There has been a significant uptick in the last year or two,"" said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Poll. ""We’re at the point now where we’re at a solid majority."" 
Murray cited a number of reasons for the increase, including President Barack Obama publicly stating his support in May 2012 for same-sex marriage. 
""It was naturally going in that direction,"" Murray said. ""When the president made his statement it kind of cemented that. We saw an immediate uptick in African-American support."" 
But even as that support grows, neither Redlawsk nor Murray said they’ve seen approval numbers hitting the 70 percent mark claimed by Sweeney. Quinnipiac also hasn’t seen support that high. 
We also looked at other polls to gauge national support and those numbers didn’t approach 70 percent, either. 
A May Gallup poll found that 53 percent of Americans said the law should recognize same-sex marriage, marking the third time Gallup has measured a reading above 50 percent on the issue. The poll surveyed 1,535 adults nationwide and had a margin of error of +/- 3 percent. 
The poll asked: Do you think marriages between same-sex couples should or should not be recognized by the law as valid, with the same rights as traditional marriages? 
An October Pew Research Center poll, done two weeks before the November 2012 general election, found different regions of the country had widely disparate attitudes on same-sex marriage. 
Mid-Atlantic states (Delaware, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania and Washington, DC) favored same-sex marriage 57 percent to 34 percent, the poll showed. New England states had the highest level of support, at 62 percent. 
Chris Donnelly, a spokesman for New Jersey Senate Democrats who responded to our initial request for comment from Sweeney, did not answer our question about the source of Sweeney’s number. 
Our ruling 
Sweeney said during a recent TV interview, ""Seventy percent of the people in the state of New Jersey want marriage equality."" 
It’s clear that support for same-sex marriage is growing, but it’s not at the level mentioned by Sweeney. A number of polls on the topic cite support ranging from just below 60 percent to a high of 64 percent, and two New Jersey polling directors say they have never seen support levels for same-sex marriage hit 70 percent. National polls also indicate lower support levels. 
We rate the claim False.

Scott Walker says success in office reflected in 2-point drop in unemployment rate from time he decided to run for governor
","
Gov. Scott Walker has long emphasized falling unemployment rates as evidence that Wisconsin’s sluggish job growth is heading in the right direction. 
In his January 2013 ""state of the state"" speech, Walker highlighted the decline from 7.8 percent unemployment the month before he took office in January 2011 to the 6.7 percent figure for December 2012. 
Now, with the recent uptick to 7.1 percent unemployment in the first quarter of 2013, Walker has reworked his message. 
Asked by host Mike Gousha on WISN-TV’s Upfront show about Democrats criticizing him for focusing on a potential presidential bid instead of the governorship, Walker replied: 
""They can’t argue with the success. We went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower. The deficit was $3.6 billion when I took office. We now have a half a billion dollar surplus."" 
Let’s take a look at the new talking point on the unemployment rate. 
Walker says the success of his economic agenda is supported by the fact that ""we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower."" 
Is he right? 
According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics figures from monthly household surveys, Wisconsin’s unemployment rate peaked as the Great Recession officially ended in mid-2009. 
That peak -- 9.2 percent -- is the figure Walker selected as a four-year comparison point. 
And it did fall 2.1 points in that time, so the numbers are accurate. 
But the statement is complicated by other factors, especially the phrase ""when I decided to run."" The unemployment rate was surging up in late 2008 and early 2009, so the timing makes a big difference. 
For instance, Walker officially announced his long-expected candidacy in spring 2009. The most recent unemployment figure at the time was 8.4 percent. 
But news reports as far back as August 2008 described Walker as ""expected"" to run. The latest unemployment rate at that time was 4.7 percent. 
When we asked Team Walker for backup, spokeswoman Jocelyn Webster said, ""he is not referring to the specific moment he decided to run, but generally to the climate during the time he decided to run four years ago."" 
Doyle and Walker 
Then there’s the issue of who gets credit for the drop from 2009 to 2013; Walker couched the two-point decline as part of ""the success"" he can point to as governor. 
Here’s the timeline: 
-- From its 9.2 percent peak in June-July 2009, the rate fell almost monthly during the late stages of Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s second term, dropping 1.4 points to the 7.8 percent mark in December 2010 when Doyle left office. 
So exactly two-thirds of the drop Walker mentions happened on his predecessor’s watch. 
-- After Walker took office in January 2011, the rate ticked down but was essentially flat for nine months before falling slowly to 6.7. Then it reversed course early in 2013, taking some of the luster off the positive trend. That left the total drop during Walker’s time at 0.7 points. 
So one-third of the drop compared to four years ago came during Walker’s administration. 
We asked Webster about this, and she responded in an email: ""The Governor was providing a frame of reference for where we were and where we are now."" 
A bit of perspective, before we wrap up. 
Wisconsin’s unemployment rate is lower than the national figure (7.1 vs. 7.6 percent). Among seven Midwest states, Wisconsin trails far behind Iowa (4.7) and Minnesota (5.3), but is well ahead of Illinois (9.3), Indiana (8.5) and Michigan (8.4). 
Wisconsin is fourth of the seven states in improvement in the unemployment rate since the month Walker took office in 2011. 
Our rating 
Walker said the success of his agenda is supported by the fact that ""we went from unemployment at 9.2 percent when I decided to run for governor four years ago to two points lower."" 
Walker’s numbers are on target if you go back ""four years."" 
But he muddies the waters by describing that as when he ""decided to run"" -- and that skews the picture when it comes to improvement. His decision came at an earlier date, when the unemployment rate was either much lower (at the time of his official announcement) or even lower than that (when he was unofficially running). 
Finally, the construction of the claim is misleading in part on the issue of who gets credit for the improvement. He discloses that he’s going back in time before he was governor but omits Doyle’s record and claims the ""success"" as his, glossing over the fact that only one-third of the gains took place on his watch. 
There’s an element of truth here, but critical facts are left out. 
That’s why we’re rating his statement Mostly False.","[('\nMike Gousha interview with Gov.

"['Rhode Island', 'Criminal Justice', 'Economy', 'Crime', 'Harold Metts']","
State Sen. Harold Metts says more than 60 percent of inmates end up back in prison
","
Even a short prison sentence can resonate through a person's life for decades. 
In recent years, members of the General Assembly have proposed various bills intended to help reformed criminals avoid the stigma of their criminal record once they have completed their sentences at the Adult Correctional Institutions. 
One such bill passed the Rhode Island Senate on June 6, 2013. 
S-358, which is now before the House for consideration, would give the Parole Board the authority to issue a ""certificate of recovery and re-entry"" to any ex-convict who has paid all fines and other penalties imposed by a court and has exhibited good conduct for a certain period of time -- one year if he was convicted of a misdemeanor and three years if he was convicted of a felony. 
Think of it as a ""diploma"" for graduating from ACI-U. 
However, anyone convicted of a felony crime of violence or any ex-con with more than one felony on his record would not be eligible for a certificate. 
State Sen. Harold M. Metts, D-Providence, told the Senate, ""When you think that Rhode Island has a recidivism rate of over 60 percent, imagine the amount of money we can save taxpayers if we opened up the door for people to get gainful employment so they that they wouldn't have to go back to crime."" 
We wondered whether more than 60 percent of inmates actually get in trouble again and end up back in prison. 
After leaving a message for Metts to ask about his source, we called the Rhode Island Department of Corrections. 
Spokeswoman Susan Lamkins said the standard used there and at other prison systems is to count how many former inmates end up being sentenced for another crime and returned to prison within three years of their release. 
The department is in the midst of its latest analysis, looking at how many of the 3,699 inmates released from prison in 2009 -- the Class of 2009, as it were -- end up back in custody. 
According to the data from the first two years, the recidivism rate for those returning because they have been sentenced for a new crime is 42 percent. 
(When such a study was last done, with the Class of 2004, that recidivism rate at the two-year mark was 46 percent, so it seems to be declining. The rate for three years was 54 percent, closer to Metts’ ""over 60 percent."") 
When we got through to Metts, he said his estimate was ""probably an old number."" 
He referred us to Nick Horton, program coordinator and policy specialist at Open Doors, a Providence organization that helps people who have been released from prison. He noted the 54 percent recidivism rate after three years from the study of inmates released in 2004 
But Horton also focused on a very separate category in that study -- 64 percent of offenders released in 2004 ended up back at the ACI within three years because they had been rearrested, couldn't afford bail and were awaiting trial. 
But there’s a problem with that percentage: not all of those people were true recidivists, in the Corrections Department's definition. Some ended up being exonerated. Some received a sentence that didn't involve jail time. (In the most recent report, 50 percent of the Class of 2009 were brought back to prison to await trial.) 
Of course, any study that only follows released inmates for three years is going to underestimate the lifetime recidivism rate because, as Metts noted, it fails to account for criminal cases that aren't going to be resolved until after the three-year mark. 
""Those that are strong spiritually can last a little bit longer, but when you're out and you can't get a job because your record is haunting you, people lose hope,"" he said. ""Even if I was wrong, 42 percent is still way too high and that's not helping the taxpayers. We need to change our public policy to allow people to reclaim their lives so that they can become productive members of society."" 
Our ruling 
State Sen. Harold Metts said, ""Rhode Island has a recidivism rate of over 60 percent."" 
For better or worse, recidivism rates are usually calculated based on how many former inmates are found guilty of a subsequent crime and end up back in prison within three years. 
The most recent data from the Department of Corrections cover two years and the rate is 42 percent. The most recent study to look at a three-year period, which covered inmates released in 2004, put the rate at 54 percent. 
The only way to get above 60 percent is to use the older study and look at an entirely different category: the number of ex-convicts who were brought back to the ACI because they had been charged with a new crime or with violating their probation. But that percentage is flawed as well because it includes at least some people who would never have seen a jail cell if they had been able to afford bail. 
Metts offered his ""over 60 percent"" as a definitive statistic. It's not. Although most of the measures we saw offered a lower number, those studies only followed the former inmates for three years or less, an artificial cutoff that makes it easier to collect statistics yet doesn't reflect the fact that anyone who goes back to prison after three years is still regarded as a recidivist. 
The bottom line: the longer inmates are followed, the higher the percentages get. And they get close enough that we regard Metts' claim as Mostly True.

Wisconsin not leaving any federal funds on the table by rejecting Obamacare expansion of Medicaid, Scott Walker administration official says
","
Gov. Scott Walker announced in February 2013 that Wisconsin would refuse what has been portrayed as a financial windfall for state governments -- an expansion of Medicaid under Obamacare that would be financed almost completely with federal funds. 
Democrats have ripped the Republican governor, with some citing estimates that his proposed alternative will cost Wisconsin state taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars. 
Yet four months after the announcement, Walker's secretary of health services, Kitty Rhoades, painted a different financial picture. 
Many people had said, ""Why did you walk away from all of the money on the table?"" the former GOP state lawmaker told a business-sponsored health care seminar in Madison on June 6, 2013. ""Which is a line that just drives me insane."" 
Later in the speech, Rhoades added: 
""We believe and we know that based off of our modeling, we’re not walking away from a dime. We actually will have more federal dollars flowing through the state of Wisconsin than we would have had by taking the enhanced rate of including people of 133 percent of federal poverty level into Medicaid."" 
So, despite estimates that state government is losing out on hundreds of millions of dollars, is it the case that """"we’re not walking away from a dime"" in federal funds? 
The wording of Rhoades' claim is key. 
Medicaid and its expansion 
Medicaid, a federal- and state-run health care program for the poor, serves more than 1.1 million people in the Badger State. Federal taxpayers pick up about 60 percent of the cost in Wisconsin. But President Barack Obama's Affordable Care Act offers an even larger share of federal funding if states make more people eligible for Medicaid, starting in 2014. 
From 2014 through 2016, Uncle Sam would pay 100 percent of the cost of expanding Medicaid coverage for adults with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. For an individual, that means an income of $15,282; for a family of four, it's $31,322. After 2016, the federal share would gradually decline until it reaches 90 percent in 2020, with the states picking up the remaining cost. 
That gives the appearance of a lot of federal money going to state governments. 
And indeed, that’s what the experts say will happen. 
The number crunchers 
Walker himself has acknowledged the federal government is offering more money to states that do the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. But he says that because of the federal budget deficit, he believes the federal government won't follow through on the promised funds. 
That, of course, remains to be seen. 
What is clear from budget experts is the State of Wisconsin is, in fact, giving up federal funds by declining the Medicaid expansion. (Although, with the state budget due to be adopted in a matter of days, the top Democrat in the state Senate held out hope that a compromise might be reached to at least give the Obamacare Medicaid expansion a try.) 
A week before Rhoades’ speech, the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which both political parties have long cited as a neutral scorekeeper on budget matters, weighed in.   
For the 2013-2015 state budget, currently being debated in the Legislature, opting out of the Obamacare Medicaid expansion would cost state taxpayers $119 million, the fiscal bureau estimated. 
The total could exceed $459 million through 2021, the bureau said. 
Similar findings were produced a few days later by RAND Corp., a California-based independent think tank. 
According to its study (subscription required), Wisconsin and 13 other states that said, as of late April 2013, they won't do the Obamacare Medicaid expansion, would forgo $8.4 billion per year in federal payments. 
So, what is Rhoades talking about? 
Rhoades’ evidence 
Her spokeswoman, Stephanie Smiley, said Rhoades doesn't dispute the fiscal bureau's estimates of state government losing out on hundreds of millions of dollars by not expanding Medicaid through Obamacare. 
Rhoades instead cites a different flow of federal funds. She argues that under Walker's alternative, even more federal money will come to Wisconsin -- but to health insurance companies and health care providers, rather than state coffers. 
Walker's plan expands Medicaid eligibility to people with incomes at 100 percent of the poverty level, but not to 133 percent, as Obamacare would do. Under the governor's plan, people with incomes between 100 and 133 percent of poverty would get health coverage from private insurers through ""exchanges,"" another feature of Obamacare. 
Citing the fiscal bureau report, Rhoades notes the federal government would give the state a total of $489 million during the 2013-2015 budget cycle if it agreed to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion. 
But she contends that ""modeling"" done by her department -- not the fiscal bureau -- projects that under Walker's alternative, $776 million to $784 million in federal money would flow into Wisconsin during that period. It would subsidize premiums and health care for people who go into the exchanges. 
The problem here is that the fiscal bureau can make solid estimates knowing how many people would be eligible for Medicaid under Obamacare. But the Department of Health Services has to guess how many people will buy insurance through the exchanges and thus bring federal dollars into Wisconsin. 
That's a difficult calculation, given that the fiscal bureau has determined many people eligible for coverage through the exchanges will decide they can't afford it. In fact, the fiscal bureau has said the Walker administration is ""unreasonably optimistic"" on the question. 
So, it's unclear whether Walker's plan will result in more federal money coming to Wisconsin insurers and health care providers than would be paid to the state under the Obamacare expansion of Medicaid. 
What is clear, is Walker's alternative to the Obamacare Medicaid expansion comes at a cost to state taxpayers of $119 million in 2013-2015 alone -- which is the criticism Rhoades was trying to refute. 
Our rating 
Responding to criticism that state taxpayers are taking a financial hit because Walker chose not to expand Medicaid through Obamacare, Rhoades claimed ""we’re not walking away from a dime"" in federal funds. 
There's an element of truth in her claim, in that under Walker's alternative plan, some level of federal funds will flow to Wisconsin insurers and health care providers based on the number of people who choose to buy health insurance through Obamacare exchanges. 
But the criticism focused on the impact on state government by not taking the Obamacare offer -- $119 million just in the next two years, a figure Rhoades doesn't dispute. Because of that, we rate her claim Mostly False.","[('\nWisconsin Health News, ""Rhoades defends Medicaid plan at WMC event"" (subscription required), June 10, 2013', 'http://wisconsinhealthnews.com/archives'), ('\nWisconsin Public Radio, ""DHS secretary promises smooth transition for former BadgerCare enrollees,"" June 7, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Walker rejects full Medicaid expansion, says 224,000 more to be covered,"" Feb. 13, 2013', 'http://news.wpr.org/post/dhs-secretary-promises-smooth-transition-former-badgercare-enrollees'), ('\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""State budget panel votes to pay hospitals $73.5 million for uninsured patients,"" June 4, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nWisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, budget paper #321, May 30, 2013', 'http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/gov-scott-walkers-badgercare-plan-would-insure-224000-more-people-ij8p25s-191079601.html'), ('\nInterview and email interview, Wisconsin Department of Health Services communications director Stephanie Smiley, June 11-13, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Taxpayers pay more under Walker Medicaid plan,"" Feb. 16, 2013', 'http://www.jsonline.com/news/statepolitics/state-budget-panel-votes-to-pay-hospitals-735-million-for-uninsured-patients-b9926098z1.html'), ('\nInterview, Wisconsin Council on Children and Families research director Jon Peacock, June 12, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, ""Gov.

Do 'illegal aliens' cost Oregon $1 billion a year?
","
The Oregon Republican Party endorses an initiative to overturn a new law that allows people in the country illegally to apply for special driving cards in Oregon. 
Suzanne Gallagher, the state party’s chairwoman, issued a press release with a list of reasons to reject the bill that was signed into law by Gov. John Kitzhaber on May 1. Here’s one reason that caught our eye: ""OFIR estimates that the annual cost to Oregon taxpayers for government services to illegal aliens, after any income tax revenue from them, is $1 billion."" 
Oregonians for Immigration Reform is a vocal and passionate group that opposes illegal immigration. OFIR did not itself calculate the costs, but relies on a December 2012 report by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a Washington, D.C., organization that also opposes illegal immigration. FAIR offers state analyses as well as a national analysis. 
It is impossible to get firm numbers when it comes to undocumented immigrants. Furthermore, studies differ on whether they are a net drain or net gain or have a negligible effect on government. 
Recent news reports indicate that unauthorized workers put more money into Social Security and Medicare than they will get out, because they’re not eligible for those benefits. Actually, they are not eligible for most government assistance, but their children, born in the United States, are U.S. citizens and can qualify for medical assistance and social services. 
Our sister PolitiFact publications have tackled similar statements in their states and ruled differently: Half True in Georgia and False in Florida and in New Jersey. They could not offer better calculations on the costs of immigration. We won’t either. 
FAIR study 
How did FAIR figure a $1 billion hit to taxpayers in Oregon? 
First, the organization estimates that 170,000 undocumented immigrants -- or ""illegal aliens"" -- and their children live in Oregon. Schooling costs make up roughly half of the $1.077 billion they consume in government services; K-12 classes plus help for students with limited English skills make up nearly three-quarters of the $1.077 billion. 
The rest of the costs to taxpayers comes from criminal justice and social services. On the flip side, FAIR estimates that undocumented immigrants contribute about $77 million a year in the form of gas, property, income and tobacco taxes. The yearly difference, then, is $1 billion. 
The Pew Hispanic Center puts the undocumented population in Oregon at 160,000, with a low of 110,000 to a high of 220,000. FAIR’s overall number of 170,000 is in the ballpark. 
FAIR estimates there are 10,715 undocumented children in Oregon schools, plus 48,215 children born in the country to undocumented parents, for a total of 58,930 children in Oregon schools. 
Public schools don’t track the information, as they must provide education regardless of documentation. What we do know is that in 2011-12 there were roughly 59,000 students identified as ""English Language Learners"" in Oregon, of which 46,500 receive language development services, according to a spokeswoman for the Oregon Department of Education. 
Obviously, not every child who needs help learning English is in the country illegally, or is the child of parents who are here illegally, but this leads us to think that FAIR’s population estimates could be, again, within field-sized ballpark range. 
The statewide average cost to educate a child was $9,364 in state, local and federal money in 2011-12. Schools receive from the state an additional $3,000 -- very roughly -- for each child who needs special language programs. 
Using FAIR’s numbers, you end up with $100.3 million to educate undocumented children and $451 million to educate children born in the country to undocumented parents. That’s close to FAIR’s overall estimate of $575 million for K-12 education. 
FAIR also calculates an extra $159 million to provide special English language classes for students. Most of that, $130 million, goes to help U.S. citizens, according to the analysis. We end up with $140 million if we multiply 46,500 students by $3,000.   
The rest of the study is summarized this way: 
About $111 million for health and emergency care, including $85 million for U.S.-born children; about $140 million for policing and incarceration of criminals; about $13 million for food and child care assistance on behalf of citizen children; and roughly $79 million in miscellaneous. 
Critics 
FAIR’s reports have been greatly criticized by both the Immigration Policy Center and Competitive Enterprise Institute. Both groups say that the analysis inflates the economic harm done by undocumented immigrants, ignores the tax benefits of immigration, and perhaps more significantly, unfairly includes the costs of educating and providing health care for U.S.-born children. 
FAIR says it’s fair to include the costs of educating children born in the United States. ""We don’t try to hide that we are including the costs,"" said Ira Mehlman, a FAIR spokesman. ""If not for the fact the parents were here breaking the law, we would not be incurring the costs."" 
The Oregon Center for Public Policy did its own analysis in January 2012. The economic think tank is friendly to immigrants and estimates that the 110,000 to 220,000 undocumented immigrants in the state earn between $2.3 billion to $4.5 billion a year, which they spend on goods and services. 
The center also estimates workers pay between $154 million to $309 million in taxes, including Social Security and Medicare taxes they won’t be able to use later, as well as property, state and local taxes. Their employers also pay taxes on behalf of workers. 
Advocates of stricter immigration rules argue that those benefits are over-inflated because legal residents and U.S. citizens could just as easily hold those jobs. 
Ruling 
The Oregon Republican Party states that an outside organization ""estimates that the annual cost to Oregon taxpayers for government services to illegal aliens, after any income tax revenue from them, is $1 billion."" 
This is a murky area and if we could calculate a definitive balance sheet of what illegal immigration costs taxpayers, well, we’d be in a different line of work. Still, our reporting finds the education cost estimates are plausible. 
What is problematic is that well more than half of the $1 billion can be credited to U.S. citizens. FAIR’s own numbers suggest nearly $700 million for the lawful children of undocumented immigrants in the United States. Those citizens are not ""illegal aliens."" 
The $1 billion calculation also ignores taxes paid by and on behalf of undocumented workers. 
The statement includes an element of truth. There is some basis for some of the numbers. We can sympathize with critics of illegal immigration who say it’s appropriate to include the costs of educating children, even if they are U.S. citizens. But citizens are not ""aliens"" and the bulk of the estimated $1 billion goes to provide services to people entitled to receive those services. 
We find the statement Mostly False.","[('\nInterview with and email from, Ira Mehlman, Federation for American Immigration Reform, June 12-13, 2013', 'http://www.ocpp.org/'), ('\nEmails from Jim Ludwick, Oregonians for Immigration Reform, June 12, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmail from David Cross, Oregon Republican Party, June 12, 2013', 'http://www.fairus.org/publications/the-fiscal-burden-of-illegal-aliens-on-oregonians'), ('\nEmail from Susan Tully, Federation for American Immigration Reform, June 13, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmails from Erik Sorensen, CAUSA Oregon, June 11, 13, 2013', 'http://www.fairus.org/publications/the-fiscal-burden-of-illegal-immigration-on-u-s-taxpayers'), ('\nInterview with Francisco Lopez, director, CAUSA Oregon, June 14, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nInterview with and emails from Crystal Greene, spokeswoman, Oregon Department of Education, June 13-14, 2013', 'http://cei.org/sites/default/files/Alex%20Nowrasteh%20-%20WebMemo%20-%20A%20FAIR%20Criticism.pdf'), ('\nInterview with and email from Chuck Sheketoff, executive director, Oregon Center for Public Policy, June 13-14, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nOregon Republican Party, ""ORP Endorses Referendum Against Oregon Driver Privilege Card for illegal aliens,"" May 29, 2013', 'http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/statistical-hot-air-fair%E2%80%99s-usa-report-lacks-credibility'), ('\nFederation for American Immigration Reform, ""The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Aliens on Oregonians (2012),"" December 2012', 'No link'), ('\nFederation for American Immigration Reform, ""The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on U.S. Taxpayers,"" July 2010', 'http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/fatally-flawed-fair-blames-immigrants-and-children-maryland%E2%80%99s-financial-problems'), ('\nCompetitive Enterprise Institute, ""A FAIR Criticism: A Critique of the Federation for American Immigration Reform’s ‘The Fiscal Burden of Illegal Immigration on United States Taxpayers,’"" Oct. 25, 2011', 'No link'), ('\nImmigration Policy Center, ""Statistical Hot Air: FAIR’s USA Report Lacks Credibility,"" March 29, 2011', 'https://www.politifact.com/new-jersey/statements/2011/aug/07/alison-littell-mchose/assemblywoman-mchose-says-illegal-immigration-cost/'), ('\nImmigration Policy Center, ""Fatally Flawed: FAIR Blames Immigrants and Children for Maryland’s Financial Problems,"" June 12, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nPolitiFact New Jersey, ""Assemblywoman McHose says illegal immigration costs New Jersey taxpayers more than $3 billion annually,"" Aug. 7, 2011', 'https://www.politifact.com/georgia/statements/2011/feb/18/federation-american-immigration-reform/georgia-pols-use-report-push-immigration-reform/'), ('\nPolitiFact Georgia, ""Georgia pols use report to push for immigration reform,"" Feb. 18, 2011', 'No link'), ('\nPolitiFact Florida, ""Vern Buchanan says illegal immigration costs Florida taxpayers $4 billion a year,"" Dec. 6, 2010', 'https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/dec/06/vern-buchanan/vern-buchanan-says-illegal-immigration-costs-flori/'), ('\nOregon Center for Public Policy, ""Undocumented Workers Are Taxpayers, Too,"" Jan. 25, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nImmigration Policy Center, ""New Americans in Oregon,"" Jan. 11, 2013, updated May 2013', 'http://www.ocpp.org/media/uploads/pdf/2012/01/iss20120125UndocumentedTaxpayers_fnl.pdf'), ('\nPew Research Hispanic Center, ""A Portrait of Unauthorized Immigrants in the United States,"" April 14, 2009\xa0\xa0\xa0', 'No link'), ('\nPew Hispanic Center, ""Unauthorized Immigrant Population: National and State Trends, 2010,"" Feb. 1, 2011', 'http://www.immigrationpolicy.org/just-facts/new-americans-oregon'), ('\nNational Conference of State Legislatures, ""A Special Report: Immigration and the States: March 2011,"" (accessed June 13, 2013)', 'No link'), ('\nNew York Times, ""For Medicare, Immigrants Offer Surplus, Study Finds,"" May 29, 2013', 'http://www.pewhispanic.org/2009/04/14/a-portrait-of-unauthorized-immigrants-in-the-united-states/')]",/factchecks/2013/jun/15/oregon-republican-party/do-illegal-aliens-cost-oregon-1-billion-year/

Jim Bridenstine: U.S. spends 30 times as much on climate change research as on weather forecasting
","Freshman Rep. Jim Bridenstine, R-Okla., attracted some attention for a House floor speech on June 11, 2013, in which he said he’s ready to accept President Barack Obama’s ""apology"" for spending too much on climate change research. In his one-minute speech, Bridenstine -- whose state has been hard-hit by severe tornadoes in recent weeks -- expressed skepticism that human activity has historically caused either global warming or cooling. He went on to say the following: ""Here’s what we absolutely know. We know that Oklahoma will have tornadoes when the cold jet stream meets the warm gulf air. And we also know that this president spends 30 times as much money on global warming research as he does on weather forecasting and warning. For this gross misallocation, the people of Oklahoma are ready to accept the president’s apology, and I intend to submit legislation to fix this."" We wondered whether Bridenstine is right that Obama spends 30 times as much on global warming research as on weather forecasting and warning. Bridenstine’s office provided us with support for his claim. For the climate change figure, they used Obama’s fiscal year 2014 request for $2.7 billion for the U.S. Global Change Research Program, which cuts across 13 federal agencies. For the weather-forecasting figure, they used $81.6 million for weather and air chemistry research under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the parent agency of the National Weather Service. Comparing these two figures works out to a 33-to-1 ratio, in line with what Bridenstine said. But there are two key problems with this calculation. He didn’t specify that he was talking about weather research Bridenstine said that Obama ""spent more on ""weather forecasting and warning,"" not ""weather forecasting and warning research."" That’s just one word, but it makes a big difference, because the National Weather Service spends a whole lot more on operations -- ""forecasting and warning"" -- than it does on research. Obama’s National Weather Service budget request for 2014 was $1.05 billion, split about 90 percent for operations and research and 10 percent for construction and acquisition. That means the ratio between climate research and ""forecasting and warning"" would be about 2.7 to 1 -- far less than the 30-to-1 ratio Bridenstine cited. Bridenstine’s office vigorously disagreed with this interpretation, arguing that the ""whole topic"" of his speech was research, as is the subject of his forthcoming legislation. However, Bridenstine’s words didn’t make clear that he’s making a comparison only to weather research. It sounds like he’s comparing climate change research to weather ""forecasting and warning."" Indeed, the only time he said the word ""research"" in the brief speech was in relation to climate change. Did Bridenstine count all of the weather research he could have? Now, for the sake of argument, let’s look at Bridenstine’s claim as if he had said ""forecasting and warning research."" Is his comparison valid? Experts we checked with didn’t have any quibbles with his $2.7 billion figure for climate change. But they did say he’s overlooking some weather research funding being conducted by agencies other than the National Weather Service or its parent, NOAA. One expert pointed us to a document issued by a federal committee that is charged with ensuring ""the effective use of federal meteorological resources"" by coordinating needs among various agencies. One of the document’s tables summarizes meteorological ""research and development costs by budget category"" for the departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Defense, Energy, Homeland Security, Interior and Transportation, plus the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. This table offers $1.25 billion as the total figure for federal meteorological research and development in 2013. If we were to use this figure, then the money spent on climate change research would be slightly more than twice as big. That’s still a gap, but it’s well below a ratio of 30 to 1. Bridenstine’s office counters that it’s not fair to use this figure for computing the ratio. They noted that some categories might be far from helpful in domestic weather forecasting, such as Defense Department projects focused on weather overseas. And they noted, correctly, that about $900 million of the $1.25 billion figure falls under NASA, and that some of the projects NASA is involved in addresses, according to the report, ""biodiversity, cryospheric science, remote sensing of water quality, atmospheric composition, and interdisciplinary science,"" as well as ""global and regional climate change"" -- topics far afield from weather forecasting. Still, NASA has a long record of working with, and covering some of the costs for, the National Weather Service, particularly on pricey satellite programs. For instance, the GPM Core Observatory is in the final stages of testing at NASA’s Goddard Space Flight Center, with a launch planned for 2014. This project is designed to provide ""near-real-time"" data on precipitation, and one of its goals is ""improved weather forecasting."" Other collaborative programs between NASA and NOAA include the Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite and Polar Operational Environmental Satellite, which will offer ""real-time weather data for use in short-term weather forecasting,"" and the Joint Polar Satellite System, which is designed to enable scientists to ""better predict medium- and long-term weather."" When we asked meteorological experts, most said Bridenstine’s ratio was at least somewhat misleading. For one thing, it’s hard to draw clear lines between climate and weather research and to remove all sources of overlap from the comparison. For instance, research into El Nino events, which have a big impact on localized weather, could be categorized as either ""climate"" or ""weather."" ""Substantial overlap exists in weather forecasting and climate research,"" said Eric D. Maloney, an atmospheric scientist at Colorado State University. ""One hot topic in our field at the moment is ‘seamless’ predictions that link weather and climate. This has applications for the prediction of hurricane activity in the Atlantic on seasonal and sub-seasonal timescales."" Rob Jackson, an environmental scientist at Duke University, called Bridenstine’s comparison ""silly."" ""The number for climate change research combines a score of federal agencies, all of them pooled together,"" he said. ""The number for weather forecasting and warning is for one and only one program within one federal agency. It’s a selective distortion of actual spending."" Regardless of what ratio you ultimately settle on, Iowa State University meteorologist William Gallus said Bridenstine does deserve credit for putting his finger on an issue that ""simmers behind the scenes in my profession"" -- the idea that climate-change funding has elbowed out weather forecasting funding. In particular, he said weather scientists sometimes chafe at the computing resources available to climate-change scientists. While this discrepancy may have roots in the greater computational power needed to model the long-term global climate, he added that meteorologists ""could really benefit from more powerful computers that allow us to run the models with far finer resolution to actually be able to simulate the tornadoes themselves."" Our ruling Bridenstine said Obama ""spends 30 times as much money on global warming research as he does on weather forecasting and warning."" We think the most obvious way to read his words is to compare climate-change research funding with dollars spent on ""weather forecasting and warning,"" which produces a 2.7-to-1 ratio. However, even if you accept Bridenstine’s argument that he meant to compare it to ""weather forecasting and warning research,"" the ratio is still not near 30 to 1. Bridenstine does have a point that climate change research exceeds weather forecasting expenditures, but he’s overstated the discrepancy.

Florida leaders say more than half of 2012 college graduates are 'unemployed or underemployed'
","
Senate President Don Gaetz and House Speaker Will Weatherford say changes are needed to Florida’s education system to match the realities of Florida’s economy. 
In a column published June 11, 2013, in the Tampa Bay Times, the two wrote that Florida’s K-12 system should emphasize rigorous vocational training for students who want it, arguing that those are the jobs that are in demand. 
The stakes, Weatherford and Gaetz wrote, are critical. 
""While more than half of last year's U.S. college graduates are unemployed or underemployed, the ironic truth is that there are thousands of jobs in Florida unfilled because employers can't find workers whose skills meet industry specifications,"" the two Republican leaders wrote. 
We decided to focus on how last year’s college graduates are faring. (We are putting Gaetz on the Truth-O-Meter because his spokeswoman said he was the one who contributed that fact to the piece.) 
The statement is actually an old line that Mitt Romney used during the 2012 presidential campaign. 
Its genesis is based on research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which in turn is based on data from the federal Current Population Survey, as well as Labor Department measures of what level of education is required to perform each of some 900 jobs. 
The findings were published by the Associated Press on April 22, 2012, under the headline ""In Weak Job Market, One In Two College Graduates Are Jobless Or Underemployed."" 
""Young adults with bachelor's degrees are increasingly scraping by in lower-wage jobs – waiter or waitress, bartender, retail clerk or receptionist, for example – and that's confounding their hopes a degree would pay off despite higher tuition and mounting student loans...,"" the AP wrote. 
""About 1.5 million, or 53.6 percent, of bachelor's degree-holders under the age of 25 last year were jobless or underemployed … Out of the 1.5 million who languished in the job market, about half were underemployed, an increase from the previous year."" 
While the Gaetz/Weatherford statement appears to mirror the AP’s reporting, there actually are a few distinctions. 
Gaetz and Weatherford did err in referring to ""last year’s U.S. college graduates,"" when the study -- which came out in 2012 -- studied all bachelor’s degree holders under 25. 
Andrew Sum, the Northeastern professor who did the research, said the bigger issue with the claim is how the figures may be interpreted and the difference between using ""jobless,"" as the AP did, and ""unemployed"" as Gaetz and Weatherford said. 
To most non-labor economists they are the same thing, but they can have a different technical definition, said Gary Burtless, a labor market expert with the Brookings Institution. Unemployed means someone who wants a job but cannot find one. Jobless means anyone who doesn’t have a job -- whether they want one or not. 
As such, Sum says that Gaetz and Weatherford inflated their claim. 
""About half the jobless were not actively looking for work partly due to college attendance,"" Sum said. Put another way, about half of recent college graduates who are ""jobless"" do not want a job because they are pursuing some other degree. Sum said his staff ran the numbers again using the first four months of 2013 and essentially found the same results. 
As far as those underemployed, it’s important to note that it might not all be the economy -- or public education’s -- fault. 
""There are many perfectly respectable things a new college graduate may be doing (like getting an advanced degree or having and raising a new child) that might leave them jobless and underemployed,"" Burtless told us via email. 
Our ruling 
In defending changes to the state’s education system, Gaetz and Weatherford said that ""more than half of last year's U.S. college graduates are unemployed or underemployed."" 
To get there, the two relied on articles citing research by the Center for Labor Market Studies at Northeastern University, which found that of recent bachelor’s degree earners -- those under 25 -- 53.6 percent were either jobless or underemployed. 
There are two factors for us in issuing our rating: 
1) How big of a mistake was it for Gaetz and Weatherford to say ""last year’s U.S. college graduates"" when the study looked at all bachelor’s degree earners under 25, a time frame that would span beyond 2012? And; 
2) How big of a difference is it for Gaetz and Weatherford to use ""unemployed"" when ""jobless"" might have been better? 
On the first question, it’s likely that the statistics would be different by looking just at 2012 graduates compared to a longer period of time (that data isn’t available). 
On the second, economists we talked to said it’s commonplace for people to interchange ""jobless"" and ""unemployed,"" though some experts would argue they mean different things. While we don’t quibble with Weatherford and Gaetz using the term unemployed, it’s important to note in this particular context that researchers looked beyond people unable to find work and included people who were not looking for work. That difference in approach changes the figure. 
After reviewing all the evidence, we think it’s safe to say that the statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. That’s exactly our definition of Half True.","[('\nTampa Bay Times, ""Act makes education a path to jobs,"" June 11, 2013', 'http://www.tampabay.com/opinion/columns/gatez-weatherford-column-act-makes-education-a-path-to-jobs/2126014'), ('\nAssociated Press, ""1 in 2 new graduates are jobless or underemployed,"" April, 22, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Gaetz spokeswoman Katie Betta, June 13, 2013', 'https://www.boston.com/news/nation/articles/2012/04/22/1_in_2_new_graduates_are_jobless_or_underemployed/?page=full'), ('\nPolitiFact, Republican Jewish Coalition says half of recent college grads ""can\'t find a job,"" Aug. 2, 2012 (Mostly True)', 'No link'), ('\nPolitiFact, ""Mitt Romney is right, getting a job right out of college can be tricky business,"" Aug. 27, 2012 (True)', 'https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2012/aug/02/republican-jewish-coalition/republican-jewish-coalition-says-half-recent-colle/'), ('\n', 'No link'), (' Time.com, Fewest Young Adults in 60 Years Have Jobs, Feb. 9, 2012.', 'https://www.politifact.com/new-hampshire/statements/2012/aug/27/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-right-getting-job-right-out-college-ca/'), ('\nCenter for College Affordability and Productivity, ""Why are recent college graduates underemployed,"" Jan. 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Andrew Sum, June 13, 2013', 'http://moneyland.time.com/2012/02/09/fewest-young-adults-in-60-years-have-jobs/'), ('\nEmail interview with Gary Burtless, June 13, 2013', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/jun/14/don-gaetz/florida-leaders-say-more-half-2012-college-graduat/

Chain email claims the health care law contains a hidden tax on sporting goods
","
PolitiFact started checking claims about the three-year-old Affordable Care Act, the health care law often called Obamacare, before the legislation became law. 
The checked statements have rated from True to Pants on Fire! on the Truth-O-Meter, but falsehoods have often drowned out the truths.Though some of the law's provisions have gone into effect, and many of its biggest features kick in next year, polls show the public still has a hard time understanding what's in it. 
We've looked repeatedly at the most persistent claims, and have seen many of them evolve. We at PolitiFact Ohio thought we had a new claim this month, when a reader forwarded a chain email we hadn't seen before. 
We looked into it, saw it dealt with a subject familiar to us, and found that it has been examined by our friends at the nonpolitical Snopes.com and several other rumor-checking sites. 
The email is built on a sales receipt from Cabela's, the Nebraska-based outdoor merchandise chain whose locations include Ohio. 
The receipt, like one posted by Snopes.com, shows a charge for a ""medical excise tax."" 
The chain email claims that Cabela's has ""refused to hide"" the charge, which is ""supposed to be hidden from the consumer."" 
It goes on to say that the medical excise tax is ""hidden in Obamacare,"" and that it applies to certain medical devices starting Jan. 1, 2013. 
Quoting an IRS publication on excise taxes, the email asks: ""What do I find under 'medical devices' under 'manufacturers taxes'?"" 
In answer, it lists: ""Sport fishing equipment; fishing rods and fishing poles; electric outboard motors; fishing tackle boxes; bows, quivers,  broadheads and points; arrow shafts; coal; taxable tires; gas guzzler automobiles, and vaccines."" 
Let's take the parts of the claim separately. 
First, it is true that there is a 2.3 percent tax on the first sale of certain medical devices in the Affordable Care Act, but it is not hidden. We've done at least six fact-checks about it, starting in October 2009, and it has been cited in numerous print and broadcast ads by opponents of the health care law, including a spot for presidential candidate Mitt Romney. 
The tax is one of the provisions in the law that offset the added costs of expanding health coverage to the uninsured, according to the Congressional Budget Office. 
The tax does not apply to eyeglasses, contact lenses, hearing aids, bandages or other medical devices ""generally purchased by the general public at retail for individual use,"" the law states. 
The tax does not apply to devices made for export. It does apply to imported devices as well as those made domestically. 
The Internal Revenue Service has posted information about what constitutes a taxable medical device. 
None of the items listed in the chain email are included. Those items are listed by the IRS as being subject to excise taxes that predate the health care act and have nothing to do with it. 
  
Contrary to the emailer's claim, the items are not listed under ""medical devices"" by the IRS. 
So why the charge on the receipt from Cabela's? 
The company earlier gave an explanation to its hometown  Scottsbluff Star-Herald newspaper. And it confirmed to us that it was reported accurately. 
A Cabela's spokesman blamed a companywide ""glitch"" in its sales register system. The problem added a 2.3 percent ""medical excise tax"" to all purchases at its stores on Jan. 1. 
The error was caught the same day, the spokesman said, and the charges would be refunded. 
Vendors typically use new sales software at the start of a year to handle changes in tax laws, Snopes.com noted. Even though the cost of taxes are typically passed along to consumers, however, the medical device excise tax applies only to manufacturers and importers, not to consumers. 
Like many chain emails, the one about Cabela’s mixes fact with falsehood. 
The  fact is the existence of the medical device excise tax, effective on Jan. 1, as part of the Affordable Care Act. But there the accuracy ends. 
The tax is not hidden. It does not apply to consumer products. The emailer’s ""proof"" of the claim that it does is actually, at best, an erroneous interpretation of an IRS posting on other excise taxes. 
Finally, Cabela’s told the Star-Herald that its charge was the erroneous result of a software ""glitch,"" and the money would be refunded. 
The email is not accurate, and its preposterous claim that fishing tackle, tires and gas-guzzling cars are classified as ""medical devices"" puts it in another category: Pants on Fire!","[('\nPolitiFact, ""The National Republican Senatorial Committee says the health care law slapped Ohio small businesses with a $500 billion tax increase,"" April 20, 2012', 'https://www.politifact.com/ohio/statements/2012/apr/12/national-republican-senatorial-committee/national-republican-senatorial-committee-says-heal/'), ('\nSnopes.com, ""Medical device excise tax,"" Feb. 20, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nUrban Legends, ""Medical Excise Tax in Obamacare,"" Feb. 19, 2013', 'https://www.snopes.com/politics/taxes/medicaldevice.asp'), ('\nInternal Revenue Service, ""Excise Taxes,"" July 2012', 'No link'), ('\nInternal Revenue Service, ""Medical Device Excise Tax: Frequently Asked Questions,"" May 22, 2013', 'http://urbanlegends.about.com/od/government/ss/Medical-Excise-Tax-In-Obamacare.htm'), ('\nScottsbluff (Neb.)

"['Energy', 'Virginia', 'Terry McAuliffe']","
McAuliffe blows hot and cold on coal
","
Terry McAuliffe wasn’t hot about coal in 2009 when he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic gubernatorial nomination. 
""We have got to move past coal,"" he said during an April 29 debate that year. ""As governor, I never want another coal plant built. I want us to build wind farms, biomass, biodiesel and solar. That’s my emphasis."" 
McAuliffe also issued a 30-page energy plan in 2009 that called for the development of clean energies and offered no hope for coal, other than an eagerness to retrain workers leaving the industry. He called for upgrades in emission controls that would make Virginia coal plants ""the cleanest in America"" and make the state ""a leader in carbon sequestration."" 
This year, McAuliffe seized his party’s gubernatorial nomination without opposition and Republicans are claiming he’s taken a much warmer position toward the fading coal industry, a long-time staple of the economy in Southwest Virginia. 
Proof of change, the GOP says, can be found in a May 8 article in the Bristol Herald Courier which quotes McAuliffe -- after visiting the headquarters of Alpha Natural Resources, one of the nation’s largest producers of thermal and metallurgical coal -- as saying he wants to help the coal industry grow.   
""I was over at Alpha Natural Resources talking about what they need done to make sure we have a healthy work force of coal, that coal can continue,"" McAuliffe told reporters. ""We need to make sure we do what we need to, to make sure this vital industry here in Virginia continues to grow. I can really help them on exports; to open up those Asia markets in China and Korea. As governor, I want to help them create more jobs to help exports around the world."" 
Josh Schwerin, a spokesman for McAuliffe, did not reply to three requests to explain whether his boss’s coal policy had changed. 
Schwerin, however, did provide some information to The Virginian-Pilot in a May 23 article. ""Terry believes we need to support coal workers, both through increased exports throughout the world, and workforce training to ensure that displaced workers can find new careers,"" he said. ""The fact is, we need an all of the above energy policy that focuses on increasing renewable energy like wind and solar while supporting existing Virginia industries."" 
Comparing all the statements, it’s clear McAuliffe is friendlier to coal now then he was four years ago, when he urged Virginia to ""move past coal."" This year, unlike 2009, he is promising to help the industry ""grow,"" promising to promote coal exports to Asian markets and calling for an ""all of the above energy policy."" 
McAuliffe does not mention coal in a 13-page agenda entitled ""Keeping Virginia Competitive in a Global Economy,"" or on campaign website site posts about his agendas on energy and jobs. In each of the postings, he talks up the need to create clean energy jobs -- particularly wind power.
