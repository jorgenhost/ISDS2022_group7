Mayors claim students in Blackstone Valley charter school were first in R.I. to achieve 100 percent proficiency in state reading tests
","
As part of the ongoing debate about mayoral academy charter schools, mayors and town administrators from several Rhode Island communities released a newspaper commentary last month touting their benefits.

The commentary,  published Aug. 21 in The Journal and credited to Warwick Mayor Scott Avedisian, Cranston Mayor Allan Fung and Cumberland Mayor Daniel McKee, highlighted test scores at the state’s first mayoral academy, in Cumberland.

""This year, the Blackstone Valley Mayoral Academy, which serves students from Central Falls, Cumberland, Lincoln and Pawtucket, became the first public school in Rhode Island history to have 100 percent of its elementary-age students proficient in reading on state assessments.""

That sounds very impressive. A 100-percent proficiency rate? The first time in the state's history? On multiple assessment tests?

We're selecting McKee as the person making the claim because he's a driving force in the school, known as Blackstone Valley Prep. He would be in the best position to know what the test scores are at his own academy.

(A proposal by Fung to create a mayoral academy for Cranston and Providence was rejected Sept. 1 by the Rhode Island Board of Regents for Elementary and Secondary Education.)

So we turned to Elliot Krieger, spokesman for the Rhode Island Department of Education. He delved into the records and here's what he found going back to 2005, when the state inaugurated its current testing system.

Last May, all 152 first graders and kindergartners at the school passed the Developmental Reading Assessment (DRA), a test developed in the late 1980s in Ohio to measure reading skills. In fact, 130 of those 152 passed with distinction.

Krieger said it was the first instance he could find of any elementary school doing so well on the current state-mandated standardized tests or, as far as he could recall, since the state began doing proficiency testing, in 1998.

In May 2010 -- the school’s inaugural year, when all the students were kindergartners -- 97 percent were deemed proficient.

""They're doing really well. No one will dispute that,"" said Krieger. ""It's not a test where this is a cakewalk.""

But the mayors’ statement leaves out an important fact: The DRA is a test that very few students take because it is given only in schools that don't go above second grade. In all other elementary schools, the state uses the New England Common Assessment Program (NECAP), a series of reading, writing, math and science tests used by Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Vermomt and Maine. Those tests start in grade 3.

Last year, only 6 of the state's 168 elementary schools took the DRA, which makes Blackstone Valley Prep a big fish in a very small pond.

""There are a lot of schools that are high-performing that don't take this test,"" said Krieger.

(Blackstone Valley Prep did have a class of fifth graders last year and those students took the NECAP test, with less impressive results -- 61 percent were proficient in reading and 48 percent were proficient in math, both below the state average. But Krieger said that doesn't reflect the quality of the school because the test was given in October 2010, before the students had spent much time there.

""They didn't teach those kids. It's testing them on what they learned the previous year, wherever they came from,"" Krieger said.)

So when Mayors McKee, Fung and Avedisian say that the Blackstone Valley Mayoral Academy is ""the first public school in Rhode Island history to have 100 percent of its elementary-age students proficient"" on a state reading assessment, they're right.

But that statement might lead readers to assume a comparison with all elementary schools in Rhode Island. Instead, the Blackstone Valley students are taking a test that students in the vast majority of elementary schools don’t take, an important qualifier.

In addition, the statement -- and its use of the plural ""assessments"" -- suggests that the students got 100 percent in more than one test, which is false.

Because the statement is mostly accurate but leaves out those important details, we rate the claim Mostly True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Mitt Romney']","
Romney says his health care bill affected far smaller percentage of people than Obama's
","
During a Sep. 5, 2011, Republican presidential candidate forum in South Carolina sponsored by Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., Mitt Romney defended the health care overhaul he signed into law when he was governor of Massachusetts, seeking to contrast it with the health care law signed by President Barack Obama last year.

DeMint, who was one of the political figures questioning candidates at his forum, asked Romney if he wished to discuss the health care law he signed as governor in 2006 -- a law that has been controversial among many Republicans, who argue that it represents too deep an intrusion by government into the health care system.

""As you know, if you're our nominee, the president is going to say that you implemented Obamacare in Massachusetts,"" DeMint said to Romney.

Romney responded, ""That will be one of my best assets if I'm able to debate President Obama, as I hope to be able to do, by saying, 'Mr. President, you give me credit for what you've tried to copy in some ways. Our bill dealt with 8 percent of our population, the people who aren't insured and said to them, if you can pay, don't count on the government, take personal responsibility. We didn't raise taxes, Mr. President. You raise taxes $500 billion. We didn't cut Medicare. One president in modern history cut Medicare'.... And the critical thing is this, …  we dealt with 8 percent.""

Then, addressing Obama’s law, Romney continued, ""He dealt with 100 percent of American people. He said I'm going to change health care for all of you. It's simply unconstitutional. It's bad law. It's bad medicine, and on Day One of my administration, I will direct the secretary of Health and Human Services to grant a waiver from Obamacare to all 50 states. It has got to be stopped, and I know it better than most.""

Romney’s comment offers a lot of facts to consider, but we’re focusing here on a specific comparison Romney made -- that the Massachusetts health care plan ""dealt with 8 percent of our population,"" which was far less than the ""100 percent of American people"" affected by the health care law enacted with support from Obama.

First, some background on the two health care laws. Previously, we’ve concluded that the Massachusetts plan and the Obama plan are similar. We even did a quiz: Romneycare & Obamacare -- can you tell the difference?

Both laws leave in place the major existing insurance systems -- employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. They reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid and by offering tax breaks to help people with moderate incomes buy insurance, using voluntary ""exchanges"" that individuals and small businesses can use to purchase private-sector health insurance. Under both laws, individuals are required to have insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the ""individual mandate."" And companies that don't offer insurance to employees must pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases.

Romney's press office did not respond to an inquiry about his statement. But in drawing his contrast at the forum, Romney focused on two related issues: the laws’ efforts to cover the uninsured and the use of the individual mandate to achieve that goal.

When Romney said that his bill ""dealt with 8 percent of our population, the people who aren't insured,"" he was using as his yardstick the percentage of people in Massachusetts without health insurance.

When you look back to the period when the bill was passed, Romney’s figure for uninsured residents is basically right. According to Census Bureau data compiled by the Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured and the Urban Institute, 8.9 percent of Massachusetts residents were uninsured in the period 2006-07.

But if you measure the comparable number of uninsured Americans at the time the federal law was enacted, it obviously was not anywhere close to the 100 percent Romney claims.

According to the Census Bureau, the percentage of Americans without health insurance nationally was slightly under 17 percent in 2009, the year Obama began pushing for the bill. According to a Congressional Budget Office estimate, the number was about the same in 2010, when the measure was signed into law. Other estimates have pegged the national number at about 15 percent.

Meanwhile, Romney said that Obama’s law ""dealt with 100 percent of American people."" That’s not exactly correct -- the law allows a few categories of people to opt out of the individual mandate, primarily those for whom it would be a financial hardship. But it’s not too far off.

However, if that’s the standard, then the two bills are quite similar. The Massachusetts plan has affordability and religious exemptions for the individual mandate that echo those in the federal law, so both laws would affect something approaching 100 percent of the population, even if not exactly 100 percent.

Comparing 8 percent to 17 percent ""would have been apples to apples,"" said Henry Aaron, a senior fellow with the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution.

Michael Tanner, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute and a critic of the federal health care law, agreed. To be consistent, he said, Obama’s plan only impacted 15 percent to 17 percent of the U.S population.

""Romney appears to be suggesting that his bill only impacted the uninsured in Massachusetts. Not true, as I have written,"" Tanner said. ""You can only get to those numbers by assuming that the only relevant part of either bill is the individual mandate and that only the currently uninsured are impacted by the mandate. Neither of those premises is true.""

Our ruling

Given the unpopularity of the federal health care law within the Republican base, it’s understandable that Romney is trying to show primary voters that the law he signed is different from the one Obama signed. However, Romney’s example is specious -- a felony case of comparing apples and oranges. Either both laws affected something approaching 100 percent of the populace, or they affected about 8 percent (in Massachusetts) and 17 percent (in the U.S. as a whole). Romney is mixing two completely different things together to make a point that simply isn't valid..

The way Romney phrased it, listeners would be led to believe that the reach of the federal law is vastly wider than that of the Massachusetts law. In reality, on the question of covering the uninsured through an individual mandate -- the specific criterion Romney used in his comments -- the percentages of people affected aren’t wildly divergent. So we rate Romney’s statement Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2011/sep/07/mitt-romney/romney-says-his-health-care-bill-affected-far-smal/
"['National', 'Corporations', 'Jobs', 'Trade', 'Workers', 'Taxes', 'SEIU']","
Did Republicans oppose closing corporate tax loopholes for outsourcing?
","
Republicans support tax breaks for corporations that send jobs overseas, says a political mailer from Service Employees International Union, or SEIU, a union that represents service workers. 
""Republicans in Congress aren't getting the message,"" the mailer says. ""Unemployment is hurting everyone in our economy, and we need to bring jobs back to America. But rather than fighting to create jobs for the middle class, Republicans in Congress fought to protect unfair tax breaks for big special interest groups and companies that ship American jobs overseas."" 
""Tell Republicans in Congress: It's time to bring back jobs to America,"" the mailer concludes. 
We wondered what SEIU's claim was based on. Obviously, there's no official tax break for shipping job overseas. 
Still, the claim is becoming a common one among Democrats. So we thought it would be useful to review some of the more specific claims we've already fact-checked here, before making a ruling on SEIU's broad claim.

Deductions for business costs. Some Democrats are steamed that businesses closing U.S. operations can deduct the closing costs as standard business expenses. ""The law, right now, permits companies that close down American factories and offices and move those jobs overseas to take a tax deduction for the costs associated with moving the jobs to China or India or wherever,"" said Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., last year. 
PolitiFact Rhode Island delved into Whitehouse's statement in some detail and ruled his statement True. In general, businesses can deduct any costs they face in the course of doing business. And the costs of shuttering a factory in the United States are not exempt. 
Whitehouse supported legislation to change that by disallowing exemptions associated with offshoring, which an official summary defines as ""any transaction in which a taxpayer reduces or eliminates the operation of a trade or business in connection with the start-up or expansion of such trade or business outside the United States."" The bill failed in the Senate because it couldn't get the 60 votes required to cut off the threat of filibuster and move the bill toward final passage. The bill failed on a 53-45 vote, largely along party lines, with Democrats voting for it and Republicans voting against it. 
Rule changes for foreign profits. President Barack Obama has charged Republicans with fighting for tax breaks for companies that outsource jobs. In 2010, Obama signed a bill into law that provided economic aid to states. So that the bill didn't add to the deficit, it also changed rules on foreign profits for companies.  
In a speech last year, Obama said called the old rules ""loopholes"" that ""actually rewarded corporations for shipping jobs and profits overseas.""

""Even a lot of America's biggest corporations agreed that this loophole didn't make sense, agreed that it needed to be closed, agreed that it wasn't fair,"" Obama said in a speech. Obama said that John Boehner, then the Republican leader and now the Speaker of the House, ""wants to reopen this loophole.""

It's a bit complicated to explain these tax loopholes, so bear with us. Basically, the United States government taxes companies on foreign profits, which not all countries do. But companies don't have to pay taxes on foreign profits until they bring the profits back to this country. So companies tend to keep the money with their foreign subsidiaries as long as possible. But companies also get U.S. tax credits for taxes they pay to foreign governments. Some companies figured out how to game the system by keeping their profits overseas while still claiming a tax credit for taxes paid to foreign governments. The new rules say companies can't claim the foreign tax credit until bring the profits back to the United States. 
The tax experts we interviewed said the old situation was definitely a loophole. But they didn't see it as a loophole particularly connected to outsourcing. And while Boehner did oppose the new rules, his position was that any increased tax burden on American companies would make them less competitive against their foreign rivals.  
We rated Obama's statement Half True. He's was right that Boehner opposed changing the rules, but there wasn't a direct connection to outsourced jobs. 
Overall Republican opposition to tax increases. Finally, some Democrats have seized on the fact that most Republicans oppose any and all tax increases, period. That means they're in favor of any current tax loopholes for offshoring corporations, according to this line of reasoning.  
That was the basis for a political attack in last fall's congressional race in Virginia's 5th District. Democrat Tom Periello, the incumbent, said Republican challenger Robert Hurt ""supports the tax loopholes that send American jobs overseas."" The basis for his claim was that Hurt had signed the ""Taxpayer Protection Pledge,"" a famous no-taxes pledge from Grover Norquist and his group Americans for Tax Reform. 
We rated Periello's statement False. The pledge says that tax changes are okay as long as they result in no net tax increases. And it doesn't mention offshoring of jobs. Hurt won the election.  
The SEIU's position 
The SEIU referred us to the rules changes for foreign profits to back up its claim, the same charge that Obama made last year. Multinational companies are sending jobs overseas, and Republicans opposed tightening the tax rules on those multinationals, said Jennifer Farmer, SEIU's deputy communications director.  
""We continue to stand by our earlier comments: In the midst of tough economic times, when lawmakers should be working together to create quality jobs and find a way out of our country’s deepening recession, Republicans in Congress have focused on the wrong priorities. They have focused on protecting big oil and tax breaks for the rich. This was true when we included the message on our mail piece. It remains true today,"" Farmer said. 
We went back and reviewed the vote on tightening tax rules on foreign profits. At the time, Democrats controlled the Congress, and the measure passed with the support of two moderate Republican senators, Sen. Olympia Snowe and Sen. Susan Collins, both of Maine. 
We should also reiterate that the experts we spoke with warned us that there's no direct connection between outsourcing and taxes on foreign profits. In 2010, shortly after the law passed, Lawrence Lokken of the University of Florida warned us that experts disagree about the effects of international tax rules on job creation. ""Whether the current system encourages companies to move jobs offshore, and whether these fixes will discourage companies from doing so, are hotly debated issues. You can find entirely respectable opinion on each side of the issues,"" he said.

Our ruling 
The SEIU is correct that Republicans did fight against Democratic plans to close tax loopholes on multinational corporations. But whether the corporations who took advantage of the tax loopholes were also outsourcing jobs is an unanswered question. The link between the multinationals' tax status and their outsourcing of jobs is not direct, and that's an important distinction. We rate the mailer's claim Half True.  ",/factchecks/2011/sep/07/service-employees-international-union-committee-po/republicans-closing-corporate-tax-loopholes/

At your gas pump, Democrats say Rep. C.W. Bill Young voted to 'cut taxes for millionaires and end your Medicare'
","
National Democrats took their message to Florida gas pumps in August, in stark red and black.

""Congressman Bill Young voted to
CUT TAXES FOR MILLIONAIRES
& END YOUR MEDICARE.""

More than four months since House Republicans endorsed Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan's short-lived budget plan, Democrats want to keep its memory fresh. ""Millionaires Over Medicare,"" funded by the official campaign arm of House Democrats, targets Republicans who voted for Ryan's budget resolution with canvassing, phone banks and the gas station ads.

In Florida, that includes Young, who after four decades in the House ranks as the state's senior member of Congress. His 10th Congressional District sits entirely inside Pinellas, a county where nearly a third of the population is over 60. ""I have made it a top priority of mine,"" his website says, ""to protect key programs like Social Security and Medicare so that our nation’s seniors can maintain a quality of life during their golden years.""

Just what did Young vote for? And did it cut taxes for millionaires and ""end your Medicare""?

The House budget resolution

The gas station ad focuses on a single April 15, 2011, budget resolution vote, according to the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Budget resolutions, as PolitiFact has reported in the past, don't have the force of law. They let the majority party make an annual political statement, creating nonbinding targets for tax and spending legislation. So, for example, we called out Republicans in 2008 for attacking Barack Obama's record on taxes based on his budget resolution votes. (See ""The budget resolution isn't that clear,"" ""Obama voted for budget resolution, not taxes,"" and ""94? Not even close."")

The 70-page budget resolution would have been nonbinding even if it had passed both houses of Congress. But the Ryan plan didn't even get that far, dying in the Democrat-controlled Senate. In the House, Republicans, including Young, endorsed the plan 235-4, while all 189 voting Democrats rejected it. In May, five Republican senators joined Democrats to scuttle it in the Senate, with a vote to consider the resolution failing 40-57. There weren't any Democrats among the yeas.

The resolution itself makes for fairly dry reading, with pages of numerical ""recommended levels and amounts"" for not only fiscal year 2012, but also years 2013-21. Two other documents seek to put it in English: ""The Path to Prosperity: Restoring America's Promise,"" from the Ryan-led House Committee on the Budget, and a Congressional Budget Office analysis of the Ryan plan.

What do they have to say about taxes and Medicare?

'Cut taxes for millionaires'

Ryan's plan would keep Bush tax cuts otherwise slated to expire in 2012, reduce the number of tax brackets, and cut the top individual rate from 35 percent to 25 percent, according to the Path to Prosperity.

But Ryan told an economics think tank shortly before the House vote, ""we're not talking about cutting taxes.""

How's that possible? Well, the reasoning assumes a couple of things. One, that since the Bush tax cuts are in place now, keeping them wouldn't constitute new cuts. Two, that any reduction in tax rates would be offset by ""getting rid of loopholes and deductions."" The problem is, neither the Path to Prosperity nor the CBO analysis specify where those ""loophole"" savings might come from.

Still, the idea is that lower tax rates wouldn't be paid for by cutting Medicare, but by other changes to tax law. The country would pull in the same amount of revenue, just a different way. Ryan called claims that his plan proposes a tradeoff between Medicare and tax cuts ""scare tactics,"" according to the Weekly Standard: ""We're talking about keeping taxes where they are and cleaning up the tax code: getting rid of loopholes and deductions, which by the way are enjoyed by the top (tax) rate filers, the people in the top two brackets, and lowering tax rates. A flatter system, a fairer system, a simpler system, one that is more internationally competitive,"" he said.

In the absence of details in the Ryan plan, commentators on both sides waged a war of words in April over the plan's tax implications for the rich.

The Democrats pointed to a New York Times editorial, a column in the Wall Street Journal, a piece by a New Republic editor and an article by liberal think tank Center on Budget and Policy Priorities to support their claim Ryan's plan would ""cut taxes for millionaires.""

Meanwhile, the New Republic piece cites conservative defense of Ryan's tax changes as self-funding — once you assume the Bush tax cut extensions aren't a cut — in the Weekly Standard (twice), National Review and Washington Post.

The think tank argues that ""for the wealthy, Ryan’s proposals are pure gold"":

• A typical hedge fund manager would benefit from Ryan’s extension of the Bush tax cuts for high-income people; the average person making at least $1 million a year would get $125,000 a year in tax breaks.

• Heirs to multi-million-dollar estates would benefit from Ryan’s estate tax proposal, which would let them inherit the first $10 million in estate value entirely tax-free.

• High-income investors would benefit from Ryan’s elimination of Medicare taxes on their investment income.

• And large numbers of high earners would benefit from Ryan’s call to cut the top rate to 25 percent, the lowest in 80 years.

Of course, who knows how those rich folks would be hit by the loss of Ryan's unnamed ""loopholes and deductions""? We're left with Ryan's word that Congress would agree to pay for lowered tax rates by raising the tax burden in other ways. But without knowing what those ways would be — what if they included, for example, the Earned Income Tax Credit that benefits low-income taxpayers? — we have to give Democrats credit for what we do know. And that's that Ryan's plan would provide at least some tax benefit to millionaires, even in the Ryan-friendly world where permanently extending the Bush tax cuts doesn't get credit as a cut (and there's a pretty good argument it should).

'End your Medicare'

Now on to the part of the gas station ad that claims that Ryan's plan would ""end your Medicare."" 
We'll be more concise here — since April, we've examined at least a half-dozen versions of this claim, all of them False or Pants on Fire.

April 11: House Republican budget abolishes Medicare in 10 years (False)

April 20: Republicans voted to end Medicare and charge seniors $12,000 (Pants on Fire)

May 25: Ad asks what the U.S. would be 'without Medicare' (False)

June 9: Rep. Robert Hurt voted to end Medicare (False)

June 10: U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan would end heath care for seniors (Pants on Fire)

June 27: There is a Republican plan to end Medicare (False)

The bottom line is, Ryan proposed to dramatically remake Medicare from a program that directly pays health care bills for the elderly to one that provides a fixed amount of support for premiums for private health insurance. Those premium support payments would increase only at the rate of inflation — not at the pace of health care costs — meaning that every year seniors could be on the hook for greater and greater percentages of their premiums. CBO wasn't sure such a plan would be sustainable in the long-term. But Medicare wouldn't end. Seniors would still get substantial government support for their health care. Still, their costs would rise, while government costs would stay in check.

Meanwhile, there's a reason this claim — that the Ryan plan would ""end your Medicare"" — is particularly misleading. The Ryan plan wouldn't alter Medicare for anyone on it now, and in fact not for anyone age 55 or older. So taxpayers at the gas pump interpreting the ad as affecting ""their Medicare"" — benefits they receive now — are precisely the ones who wouldn't be affected. And that does look like a scare tactic, especially in a county where a third of residents are eligible for Medicare or within spitting distance. 
Our ruling

The Democrats spread the message that ""Congressman Bill Young voted to cut taxes for millionaires and end your Medicare.""

His vote for a House budget resolution did no such thing: Even if it had passed the Senate, it was a nonbinding blueprint, not a change in tax code or Medicare law.

Still, we're willing to accept his vote as advocacy of the plan's main ideas. So did the Ryan plan propose to cut taxes for millionaires and end Medicare?

We chatted with Young's spokesman, Harry Glenn, who said Young had this to say about the Democrats' claim: ""In the vernacular of (PolitiFact editor) Bill Adair and PolitiFact, saying that that was a vote to end Medicare is a flat out Pants on Fire lie.""

It's certainly misleading, but given the Ryan plan's significant reinvention of the program, we wouldn't call it ridiculously false. On top of that, the Democrats do have a point that the Ryan plan proposed tax cuts for millionaires — even if those cuts wouldn't be at the direct expense of Medicare and even if those cuts would be offset by closing tax loopholes. Balancing the two parts to this claim, we rate the ad Mostly False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/07/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democrats-say-rep-cw-bill-young-voted-cut-taxes-mi/
"['Federal Budget', 'Medicare', 'Wisconsin', 'Joe Biden']","
Vice President Joe Biden says Rep. Paul Ryan’s budget proposal would eliminate Medicare in 10 years
","
Addressing donors to President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign at a fundraiser, Vice President Joe Biden described stark choices for voters in 2012.

He painted Obama as a strong leader, gutsy enough to order a covert raid on Osama bin Laden’s compound and to try for a big deal on debt reduction.

In contrast, he said Republicans are headed the wrong direction on Medicare under the reform plan authored by Wisconsin Republican Paul Ryan, chairman of the House Budget Committee.

""These guys have laid it out where they want us to be,"" Biden told attendees at the event in Tulsa, Okla., on Aug. 30, 2011. ""Paul Ryan laid out their budget. Their budget eviscerates -- it eliminates Medicare. They say it doesn't. It makes it a voucher program. I call that eliminating Medicare in the next 10 years.""

The remarks -- reported in part on the ABC News website -- echo multiple Democratic attacks on aspects of Ryan’s deficit-cutting 10-year ""Path to Prosperity plan. That resolution was passed in the GOP-controlled House  in April 2011 but rejected by the Democrat-controlled Senate a month later.

PolitiFact has not looked favorably on the accuracy of the Democratic charges on Ryan’s proposed transformation of Medicare, which he says is aimed at reducing massive federal deficits and debt.

For example, the national site rated Pants on Fire a Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee claim that ""seniors will have to find $12,500 for health care because Republicans voted to end Medicare.""

And we rated False a Move.On.org email claim that the House Republican budget ""abolishes Medicare within 10 years.""

So how do Biden’s comments fare?

Biden minced no words, saying the GOP path ""eviscerates"" -- that is, guts -- the health care program for the elderly. Then he went further, saying it would be ""eliminated"" in 10 years.

There is significance to the 10-year mark.

The GOP proposal would, as the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office noted, gradually convert the current Medicare program to a system under which beneficiaries received premium support payments that can be used to help pay for a private health insurance policy.

Beginning in 2022, ""all newly-eligible Medicare beneficiaries...would only have access to health coverage through private insurance plans, rather than through the current government-run Medicare program (i.e., traditional Medicare), or under a Medicare Advantage plan,"" a Kaiser Family Foundation study noted.

That’s a fundamental switch.

Medicare would ""no longer provide coverage for medical care, but instead provide a ""subsidy"" toward the purchase of a private health insurance plan,"" the Kaiser study said.

The CBO found that the change would save the government money. But it does so by asking future Medicare beneficiaries to pay more for current levels of coverage, PolitiFact has reported from the CBO report.

It’s important to note, the GOP resolution specifically exempts existing beneficiaries and future beneficiaries who are currently 55 and over.

The vice president’s office gave us its view on Biden’s remarks.

Medicare is a ""system of guaranteed affordable health insurance for seniors. Preserving Medicare in its current form is a core Democratic value,"" the office said in an email.

""If you replace the current system with vouchers, or premium support payments, then you are eliminating the principle of guaranteed affordable insurance and thus eliminating Medicare as we know it.""

Those last four words are very important -- and were missing from the original statement, the one that got the attention and that we are rating.

Our ruling:

Biden says Ryan’s plan ""eliminates Medicare"" in 10 years. In stating it that way in front of campaign donors, he strays from the ""as we know it"" qualifier even the president has used.

The bottom line is that all seniors would continue to be offered coverage under the proposal, and the program’s budget would increase every year. The plan would reduce the growth in Medicare spending but not wipe out that spending. And current beneficiaries and those currently 55 and over would not be affected by the changes. It changes Medicare, dramatically, but does not eliminate it.

We rate Biden’s statement False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/07/joe-biden/vice-president-joe-biden-says-rep-paul-ryans-budge/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Ron Paul']","
Ron Paul says Rick Perry was Al Gore's campaign chairman not long ago
","
Editor’s note: After doubts were raised about Rick Perry’s role in Al Gore’s 1988 presidential campaign, we looked afresh into the matter, concluding in September 2011 that Perry was not Gore’s Texas campaign chairman. This research has prompted us to revise downward our rating of Paul’s claim to Half True.

Interviews and news articles confirm that Perry was among 28 Democratic legislators who endorsed Gore for president in January 1988. But there’s no proof he led or ran Gore’s campaign in Texas. It appears that a Democratic opponent slapped various Gore campaign leadership labels on Perry in a 1998 election year and, partly because Perry did not dispute them, the descriptives stuck.

For archival purposes, though, the article below retains the text of our original Paul fact check, which was published Aug. 15, 2011. 
U.S. Rep. Ron Paul told a gathering in Iowa the other day that he wasn’t worried about his chances if fellow Texan. Rick Perry joined the Republican presidential race.

As caught on video by a San Francisco Chronicle reporter, Paul said Aug. 10 in Mason City that Perry’s candidacy ""probably will help us, because he’ll just further dilute the establishment vote. He’s part of the status quo."" Paul also said Perry’s gubernatorial record doesn’t show him to be a conservative. He added that Perry ""actually was the chairman for Al Gore at one time, not too many years ago.""

Gov. Perry for Gore, the former Democratic vice president, not so long ago?

Indeed, as we noted in a 2010 fact check, when Perry was still a Democrat, he was the Texas state chairman for Gore's presidential campaign in 1988, the year before he switched parties in anticipation of running for state agriculture commissioner in 1990.

What brought Perry to pitch in for Gore, whose candidacy washed out after the Tennessee senator failed to do well outside his native South? At the time, many conservative Texas Democrats put stock in Gore’s campaign, among them former Gov. Dolph Briscoe and then-House Speaker Gib Lewis, who flew to Washington to endorse Gore.

Later, Perry said he found out Gore was far from a real conservative. ""Going through that (Gore experience) was part of what started me through the process of changing parties,"" Perry said. ""I came to my senses.""

In the Texas primary, Gore ran third to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

In late 2009, Perry revisited his disagreement with Gore over the human impact on global warming. Suggesting he'd seen the light on the climate issue while Gore had drifted into darker territory, Perry joked: ""I certainly got religion. I think he's gone to hell.""

Don’t count on the two to be joined in a cause again.

Per Paul’s comment, Ryan J. Rusak of The Dallas Morning News wondered in an Aug. 11 blog post if it’s fair to say Perry was Gore’s chairman ""not too many years ago.""

Debra Medina claims Rick Perry was a Democrat and Al Gore's campaign manager
","
Editor’s note: After doubts were raised about Rick Perry’s role in Al Gore’s 1988 presidential campaign, we looked afresh into the matter, concluding in September 2011 that Perry was not Gore’s Texas campaign manager or chairman. This research has prompted us to revise downward our rating of Medina’s claim to Half True.

Interviews and news articles confirm that Perry was among 28 Democratic legislators who endorsed Gore for president in January 1988. But there’s no proof he led or ran Gore’s campaign in Texas. It appears that a Democratic opponent slapped various Gore campaign leadership labels on Perry in a 1998 election year and, partly because Perry did not dispute them, the descriptives stuck.

For archival purposes, the article below retains the text of our original Medina fact check, which was published Jan. 16, 2010. 
GOP gubernatorial hopeful Debra Medina, a Wharton businesswoman, started a question to Gov. Rick Perry during Thursday night's GOP gubernatorial debate by pointing out he hasn't always been a Republican. 
Medina said: ""Governor, you were a Democrat, having worked for Al Gore as his campaign manager..."" 
The Gore-y chapter of Perry's political life hasn't come up in a while. 
We decided to explore Medina's two-part claim.

Perry didn't — and couldn't — dispute Medina's reminder that he was once a Democrat. Perry, whose father was repeatedly elected as a Democrat to the Haskell County Commission, won his first election, to the Texas House in 1984, as a Democrat. He won re-election in 1986 and 1988 before switching parties to challenge Democratic Agricultural Commissioner Jim Hightower in 1990 — a race that Perry won in an upset.

In the debate, Perry didn't answer Medina's charge that he was Gore's campaign manager.

In fact, according to news accounts and Perry's campaign, Perry served as Gore's Texas campaign chairman in 1988.

What brought Perry to pitch in for Gore, whose candidacy washed out after he failed to do well outside his native South?

According to news reports at the time, many conservative Texas Democrats put stock in Gore’s campaign, among them former Gov. Dolph Briscoe and then-House Speaker Gib Lewis, who flew to Washington to endorse Gore.

Later, Perry said he found out Gore was far from a real conservative.

""Going through that (Gore experience) was part of what started me through the process of changing parties in 1989,"" Perry said. ""I came to my senses.""

In the Texas primary, Gore ran third to Massachusetts Gov. Michael Dukakis, the eventual nominee, and the Rev. Jesse Jackson.

Late last year, Perry revisited his disagreement with Gore over man’s impact on global warming. Suggesting he'd seen the light on the climate issue while Gore had drifted into darker territory, Perry joked: ""I certainly got religion. I think he's gone to hell.""

So the two won't be launching any new joint ventures.

But Medina correctly nudged Perry about his Democratic roots. And she was close to right about his Gore connection, though a visitor from another planet might read her statement to mean Perry was improbably Gore's national campaign manager. Instead, he was Gore's Texas chairman.

We rate her statement Mostly True.

Sen. Rob Portman says the U.S. government is the nation's largest energy user
","
Ohio's Sen. Rob Portman is co-sponsor of the Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act, introduced in May, which aims to promote energy savings in residential and commercial buildings and industry through the use of energy-efficient technology, building codes and financial incentives.

Portman says the bipartisan measure will help the economy, among other benefits, by increasing productivity and creating jobs. In an article written for the Toledo Blade, the first-term Republican said the legislation will also save millions of tax dollars because ""it will require the federal government — the largest energy user in the country — to adopt energy-saving techniques.""

That stirred the curiosity of PolitiFact Ohio, if not our skepticism. Is the federal government really the country's biggest energy user? And -- drum roll -- how big is it?

We asked Portman's office for background. Highlighting the bill's bipartisan support, they reached across the aisle and down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House.

President Obama, they noted, announced last year that the federal government would reduce its greenhouse gas pollution 28 percent by 2020, to ""lead by example in building the clean energy economy.""

""As the largest energy consumer in the United States,"" the president said, ""we have a responsibility to American citizens to reduce our energy use and become more efficient. Our goal is to lower costs, reduce pollution, and shift Federal energy expenses away from oil and towards local, clean energy.""

Showing how large a consumer it is, the White House said the government spent more than $24.5 billion on electricity and fuel in 2008 alone.

Keep in mind, that does not pay simply for heating and cooling buildings in Washington. It includes the costs of fueling military jets, ships and vehicles. The Defense Department is the single biggest energy user in government.

Kateri Callahan, president of the Alliance to Save Energy -- a coalition of business, government, environmental, and consumer leaders -- gave testimony to the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee in support of Portman's bill in June.

""Without the energy efficiency improvements we’ve made since 1973, we would need about 50 percent more energy to power today’s economy than we are currently using,"" she said, citing earlier federal efforts to reduce energy use and pollution.

""As the nation's largest energy consumer,"" Callahan said, ""it is critically important that the federal government lead by example.""

How large is largest?

Callahan said the government accounted for 1.6 quadrillion BTUs of energy use in fiscal 2008, costing $24.5 billion. That use represented about 1.6 percent of the nation's energy consumption for the year, she said.

The Alliance to Save Energy told us her source was the Federal Energy Management Program's annual report to Congress in January 2010.

Portman's office provided the same report, which is based on data submitted by federal agencies to the Department of Energy. Its website has figures dating back to 1949.

Slow Housing Market Poses Problems
","
Anyone trying to sell real estate inside Atlanta’s city limits knows the once-red-hot market, with a few exceptions, is pretty chilly.

Some experts are so despondent they see the Alpha and the Omega announcing the end of time.

Others think we are in a housing slump that will right itself in a few years.

There are many explanations for the downturn in the housing market.

Atlanta City Councilwoman Yolanda Adrean tossed out one possibility in June when she said on the city’s website: ""We are overbuilt on housing.""

Whoa. Let’s see, the unemployment rate is up and credit is tight, but does the city have too much housing?

To the Truth-O-Meter!

Adrean said the statement is based on conversations she’s had with friends in the real estate
business and articles she’s read in the local media, including The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

She said she meant that the demand for office as well as residential properties was lower than the inventory.

""I would love to be wrong,"" Adrean told PolitiFact.

Bill Adams, president of Adams Realtors, said there are a few specific examples of an oversaturated market within the city. A few neighborhoods in the city, such as Vine City, have been
hit hard by foreclosures and as a result have a glut of housing. Likewise, the Buckhead
condominium market is clearly overbuilt.

But he said that’s not what’s holding back the broader real estate market.

""We’re not like a suburban county that had vast acres of housing built,"" Adams said. ""I think
mostly it’s a result of buyers sitting on the sidelines.""

Potential home buyers, many of whom are worried about job security, don’t want to take on
additional debt and instead are waiting until the economy stabilizes, he said. Banks, in some cases, have made it tougher to borrow money. All of it creates a critical mass that spells trouble for the Atlanta housing market.

Housing sales data collected by Adams show the average sale price for some neighborhoods, such as Inman Park, an upscale neighborhood of tree-lined sidewalks and expensive Victorian housing, are higher than last year. But prices continue to decline in other areas.

And last year there was a greater incentive to buy because many people were trying to take advantage of the federal housing tax credit before it expired.

SmartNumbers analyst Steve Palm said the city does have an overabundance of depressed
housing.

The city currently has 6,000 houses for sale under $50,000, Palm said. And in the last year and a half 24,760 houses sold for less than $50,000.

""We have a lot of vacant homes,"" he said.

Even so, Palm said the city does not have too many houses on the market.

""Our inventory is way down,"" he said.

Some economists speculate that a lot of people are keeping their properties off the market unless they absolutely have to sell them. That also lowers inventory.

The current housing inventory is about 40 percent lower than 2007 levels, Palm said.

If the number of closings for the metro area -- precise numbers for the city proper are hard to come by -- remained stable and there were no additional houses added to the market, it would take 8.7 months to sell off all the houses in the metro area, he said At the peak of the housing boom it would have taken about 14 months to sell off all available housing in the metro area.

This is partly the result of a slowdown in new housing construction, he said. New construction is down 90 percent from the peak years.

Bill Murray, the managing broker with Prudential Georgia Realty, agrees there is little new housing
and points out that the population of Atlanta is growing, albeit slowly. Census numbers for the city are disputed, but it’s generally agreed the city’s population has increased over the past 10 years.

This would suggest the city’s problem is not an oversupply of housing.

But Murray said an explosion of foreclosures has helped create an inventory larger than demand.

This is why it’s a buyer’s market, he said, so in that sense Adrean has a good point.

This was a tough one for the old Truth-O-Meter. Adrean’s statement does not apply to some
popular intown neighborhoods and new housing starts are few and far between even as the city’s
population continues to inch up, but demand is still low.

The councilwoman is not wrong, but she’s not totally right either.

Her statement is accurate but leaves out important details. That’s our definition of Half True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/07/yolanda-adrean/slow-housing-market-poses-problems/

Democratic Party says Huntsman supports Medicare plan that would end guaranteed benefits
","
The latest Democratic effort to paint Republicans as Medicare destroyers is a bit more nuanced than previous attempts that have faced our Truth-O-Meter and it points to a core truth about Medicare -- although not one that would make every Democrat happy.  

On the eve of a visit to the Granite State by GOP presidential hopeful Jon Huntsman, Democratic Party chair Ray Buckley said, ""he [Huntsman] has even signed on to the GOP's extreme proposal to end Medicare as we know it, which would deny guaranteed benefits to 980,000 Granite Staters.""

For this fact-check, we're going to examine whether Huntsman supports the Republican Medicare plan from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan and whether it indeed would end ""guaranteed benefits"" to the 980,000 people.

The Huntsman campaign told us that Huntsman considers the Ryan plan a ""good step forward.""  The Democrats quote him telling ABC News that ""I would have voted for it.""  If Huntsman wanted to put some distance between himself and the Ryan plan, he’s had his opportunities and he hasn’t done it.  So Buckley is correct on this point.

And as for the 980,000, that is roughly the population of people in New Hampshire under 55, the age group that would be affected by the Ryan plan. (It leaves current Medicare intact for people 55 and older.)

Democrats elsewhere have ended up on the wrong end of the Truth-O-Meter for saying that  Republicans ""voted to end"" Medicare. The Ryan proposal would certainly make fundamental changes in Medicare.  It turns Medicare from a defined benefit program into a defined contribution program so by definition, benefits would no longer be the foundation from which everything else follows.

The Ryan plan says ""future Medicare recipients will be able to choose from a list of guaranteed coverage options, and they will be given the ability to choose a plan that works best for them."" So there will be a list of benefits but beyond that, the plan provides few details.  Also, according to a Congressional Budget Office analysis, people would end up paying more for health care under the Ryan plan. That might not be the same as being denied coverage for a particular service, but people may opt out of coverage to save money.

Where Democrats get into the most trouble is in their use of the word ""guaranteed"".  It’s a loaded word and unpacking it takes us to the nut of the Medicare conundrum.  The New Hampshire state committee got its language from the analysis of the Ryan plan by the Democratic staff of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.  That report refers frequently to guaranteed benefits, as in ""Medicare provides essential guaranteed benefits for all who qualify and enroll.""

In assessing the impacts of the GOP plan, House Democrats refer to an analysis of the Ryan proposal from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan body that crunches numbers for Congress.  Curiously, the CBO letter never speaks of benefits as guaranteed.  Instead, it uses the term ""standardized benefit,"" which the CBO describes as the most average level of services used by the most typical Medicare patient.

Other analysts also shun the word ""guaranteed.""  Paul Ginsburg, president of the Center for Studying Health System Change, an independent research group cited by both Republicans and Democrats, said in the context of Medicare, ""I’ve never heard the word ‘guaranteed’ before,""  adding that, ""policy wonks like me talk in terms of Medicare being a defined benefit program.""

Ginsburg means that written into the actual Medicare law, you are entitled to those services.  To Joe Baker, president of the Medicare Rights Center, a group that views health care as a basic human right, the situation is clear.  ""The Medicare program does guarantee a set of benefits,"" Baker said.

For our purposes at PolitiFact, the difference between an entitlement and a guarantee feels pretty small and it seems reasonable to use the terms interchangeably.   

But if the Democratic vocabulary is sound, it also masks a challenge that confronts Democrats just as much as Republicans -- how much is the country willing to pay for Medicare in the future?  Or to put it another way, are those guaranteed benefits as rock solid as the Democratic language implies?  When they talk about 980,000 New Hampshire residents losing benefits, that includes kids who are babies today.  The Democrats would have us believe that what Washington promises today will be in place 65 years from now.

Even Joe Baker with the Medicare Rights Center said that ""Congress could rewrite the law and say we are not covering this service or that service from this day forward.""  That’s simply a legal fact of life. So the ""guarantee"" Buckley refers to is not ironclad.

Bob Moffit, a health care economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, goes further. Moffit argues that the Democrats’ signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act, has already put the wheels in motion to undermine the services that Democrats say they want to protect.

Moffit zeros in on the law’s measures to rein in Medicare spending.  The law already includes $400 billion in provider cuts over ten years and it pegs program dollars to an inflation rate and economic growth as measured by GDP.  The general consensus is that to avoid blowing past those limits will require even deeper cuts in how much Medicare pays doctors and hospitals.  The ACA has a mechanism to explore those kinds of savings --  the Independent Payment Advisory Board. It would be able to recommend provider payment cuts that would be put on a fast-track through Congress.  If Congress failed to act, the recommendations would go into place.

""The net effect might be,"" Moffit said, ""you might have a rich benefit package, but if the physician payment is too low, you just don't get those services because no one will provide them to you at the Medicare price.""

By Moffit’s logic, the Democrats offer no more of a guarantee than the Republicans.  He said the Democrats would use the back door of lower reimbursement rates and it would be the providers turning people away, not the government.

Ginsburg disagrees with Moffit.  ""It’s a legitimate point to be raising,"" Ginsburg said, ""but it has never happened.""  For hospitals, Medicare is such a large part of their business, even in the face of lower reimbursement they find ways to deliver the care.  Their other choice, dropping out of Medicare altogether, would be a financial disaster.

But when it comes to the long view on Medicare, Ginsburg doesn’t let the Democrats off the hook.  He believes the country can’t afford Medicare as we know it.  ""The Democrats disappoint me,"" he said, ""in not coming up with their alternative that addresses the affordability problem.""

Our Ruling

The New Hampshire Democratic Party Chair said Huntsman supports a GOP Medicare plan that would deny guaranteed benefits to 980,000 Granite Staters.  He’s right about Huntsman's position and the number of New Hampshire residents that would be affected.

But he ignores that there is the possibility that the current benefits could be trimmed and he is exaggerating the facts about the Ryan plan. Many details about the plan are still unclear, particularly what would be covered.

The use of the word ""guarantee"" suggests something more certain in the future than is supported by the current state of the economy and the health care law.  It suggests that hard choices for somebody don’t lie ahead and that’s not very likely.

Barack Obama says payroll tax cut has boosted average family income by $1,000
","
During a Labor Day speech in Detroit, President Barack Obama offered a sampling of policy proposals to get the nation’s economy moving. During the speech, Obama touted one policy achievement he had already enacted -- a one-year, 2 percentage point cut to the payroll tax that Obama was able to include in a December 2010 tax package. The package that passed with bipartisan support also extended the expiring George W. Bush-era tax cuts, among other things. 
""Last year, we worked together, Republicans and Democrats, to pass a payroll tax cut,"" Obama told the crowd in Detroit on Sept. 5, 2011. ""And because of that, this year the average family has an extra $1,000 in their pocket…."" 
Because tax year 2011 is still under way -- meaning that Americans’ personal financial situations will be subject to countless factors between now and Dec. 31 -- it’s impossible to know for sure how much of a benefit the average American family will see when they finally file tax forms next spring. Still, we wondered whether Obama’s figure is supported by credible estimates. So we took a look. 
First, some background about the tax, and the tax cut, that Obama is referring to. The payroll tax refers to federal taxes taken directly from the paychecks of employed Americans. It is primarily used to fund Social Security and Medicare. 
The policy Obama signed into law temporarily reduced the portion of the payroll tax that funds Social Security by 2 percentage points. It is in force for the duration of 2011. 
You can do a rough assessment of Obama’s claim by using some basic math. We prefer to use median income -- the income level that’s precisely in the middle when all incomes are ranked from smallest to largest -- because, unlike the mean (or average), it’s not subject to influence by a small number of very high earners. However, since Obama said ""average,"" we’ll offer both figures. 
The median household income in 2009 -- the most recent year available -- was $49,777. Lowering the tax rate by 2 percent reduces the tax burden for the median family by $996, or very close to the $1,000 Obama cited. 
As for mean household income, it was $67,976, meaning that the 2 percent payroll tax cut would have left $1,360 extra in the pockets of the average family. By this measure, Obama understated the benefit, though as we noted, an average is a less-than-ideal yardstick. 
But there are at least two reasons why using even the median figures is imperfect. 
First, not all income is subject to the payroll tax, including interest income, dividends, capital gains, inheritances and Social Security benefits. These income streams are taxed in various ways, but not by the payroll tax, and thus they get no benefit from the payroll tax cut. 
Second, not all households include people who are working, and who can therefore benefit from a payroll tax cut. The two most obvious categories are people or couples who are unemployed, and individuals or couples who are retired. 
To gauge the impact of these factors, we turned to estimates by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. The center found that the average benefit from the payroll tax cut was $934 -- slightly lower than Obama claimed. (The median benefit from the tax cut may well be lower still, but the center didn’t calculate it.) 
Meanwhile, not all households will benefit. Just under 78 percent of ""tax units"" -- which roughly equates with households -- will see a reduction in taxes from the payroll tax cut. 
So according to the Tax Policy Center, the 78 percent of households who see a benefit will see an average reduction of $934. The remaining 22 percent of households will see no benefit. 
These are nuances that Obama didn’t capture in his Labor Day speech.

Our ruling 
Obama’s statement is close to correct, but it lacks some clarifications that would have made it fully accurate. First, nearly a quarter of families don’t benefit from the payroll tax cut, although this may be obvious to listeners, since he specifically referred to a ""payroll"" tax cut. Second, the amount that households saved is at most $934, according to the Tax Policy Center’s calculations -- an amount that would decrease if the center had used a median rather than an average. Obama would have been better off saying that ""the average working family has nearly $1,000 extra in their pocket"" this year as a result of the payroll tax cut. On balance, we rate Obama’s comment Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/06/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-payroll-tax-cut-has-boosted-aver/

Wisconsin Democratic Party says Republican Representatives Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are making people pay for access to them
","
For members of Congress, the ""town hall"" meeting with constituents has taken on a new dynamic. The once-routine chats with the folks back home have, at times, become highly charged sessions with large crowds. They’ve become a barometer of sorts of public sentiment -- or the ability of opponents to organize.

Democrats faced hostile crowds during the summer of 2009 when the hot topic was the federal health care reform bill. Some of the meetings drew hundreds and saw shouting, pushing and shoving. President Barack Obama decried what he called ""scare tactics"" from opponents. And one left leaning blog ran a list of dozens of town hall meetings believed to be targeted for disruption.

Congressional Republicans got a similar reception in the spring and summer of 2011.

The frequent topic: Proposals by House Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) to alter Medicare. Tempers flared and meetings were disrupted, including one in April in Racine where Ryan asked police to remove a protester.

So as Congress settled into its August break, the Wisconsin Democratic Party took a shot at some of the state’s GOP members of Congress -- Ryan, and freshmen Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble.

In an Aug. 17, 2011 email to supporters, state Democratic Party chairman Mike Tate said: ""Paul Ryan, Sean Duffy and Reid Ribble are so ashamed to own up to their disastrous records that they are shutting down town hall meetings, or making their constituents pay to attend them.""

Buried amid the heated, and opinionated, rhetoric -- ""so ashamed to own up to their disastrous records"" -- there’s a powerful factual claim: Are the three ""shutting down"" town hall meetings or ""making constituents pay"" to see them?

A Democratic Party spokesman did not respond to an email request for evidence backing up the statement. So we were left to search the public record and to make our own calls.

The genesis of the claim appears to be a Politico article from the day before the party’s release that began this way: ""The House Budget Committee chairman isn’t holding any face-to-face open-to-the-public town hall meetings during the recess, but like several of his colleagues he will speak only for residents willing to open their wallets.""

Now, what about the party’s claim?

The claim starts off on a wrong track: Ribble participated in a forum in Appleton on Aug. 8, 2011, and Duffy held a town hall meeting in Wausau on Aug. 15, 2011. Ryan, meanwhile, held an Aug. 8, 2011 ""telephone town hall meeting"" with residents of Rock County.

So, all three had meetings of some variety -- in person or the newfangled phone-in approach -- before the party’s claim was even made.

Indeed, members of Congress don’t always have town hall meetings during a recess. And by at least one measure, Republicans were more likely to do so this time than Democrats.

A nonpartisan group called No Labels released a survey Aug. 22, 2011 that found ""67.9% of Democrats and 50.8% of Republicans stating they had no town hall meetings scheduled for the recess period.""

So what about the second thrust of the Democratic claim: Are the Republicans hiding behind a pay wall?

We found three events where money was involved. The events were not fund-raisers for the congressmen, but lunch meetings open to the public that carried a cost.

The most highly publicized -- and politicized -- one is an appearance by Ryan on Sept. 6, 2011 sponsored by the Whitnall Park Rotary Club.

The club’s website says: ""This is NOT a town hall meeting format, and the $15 fee covers only the lunch and other costs incurred in enabling an open public invitation.""

Club officer Gilbert Freen told us the group routinely charges guests to cover the cost of the lunch served at its meetings.

The Democrats, some union groups and others view this as outrageous. Citizen Action of Wisconsin says it is organizing buses to bring people to protest Ryan’s appearance.

But politicians of all stripes regularly appear at such luncheons.

For instance, on Aug. 23, 2011, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore (D-Wis) spoke to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee. That event was not open to the public -- just to members and their guests, who paid $17.50 each. Numerous other politicians (including Ryan and Moore together in 2009) have appeared at Newsmaker Luncheons sponsored by the Milwaukee Press Club. At those events, which are open to the public, a fee is charged -- for the lunch.

Ryan’s office said the Whitnall club meeting was the only event the congressman had scheduled during the August break that involved a charge.

We found two other paid events, one each from Ribble and Duffy.

Ribble’s office said he participated in the Aug. 8 forum addressing regulation with two other local civic groups. ""I believe it was at lunchtime and there was a cost for the lunch,"" said Ribble spokeswoman Ashley Olson.

Duffy participated in one event -- an Aug. 18, 2011 small business forum at the University of Wisconsin-Superior -- where participants were charged $15 for lunch and materials.

So, each of the three GOP congressmen singled out had at least one event where a fee was charged. But such appearances are routine tor politicians of both parties, the fee covered lunch and did not go to the congressman.  

The thrust of the statement, though, was broader still -- that the three were ""shutting down"" town hall meetings and thus the ability to talk to the elected official.

Here’s what we found about the summer recess schedule for each when we asked aides, checked public schedules and looked at news accounts:

Ryan:  Toured various local businesses, held ""multiple hour-long meetings"" with small business owners, Realtors and home builders. In addition to the ""telephone town hall meeting,"" attended the Walworth County Fair, a Boy Scout lunch and a 75th anniversary lunch for Kenosha Beef. Constituents could contact Ryan’s office for an appointment to meet with him in his office, said spokesman Conor Sweeney. Ryan was on vacation in Colorado for part of the month.

Ribble: Held a three-hour ""Conversations with your Congressman"" on Aug. 13, 2011 -- 10 minute one-on-one meetings; attended an Aug. 12, 2011 forum on transportation; an Alzheimers Association public input session, and a forum with seniors about Medicare.

Duffy: Like many House members with large districts, Duffy maintains a mobile office, and its schedule is listed prominently on the congressman’s web page. Duffy himself is on the bus some, but not all, of the time, said Brandon Moody, chief of staff. Moody said Duffy has spent the entire August break in his northern Wisconsin district. Including the town meeting in Wausau, he held a half dozen coffees and, yes, community town hall meetings. He also visited county fairs and toured area businesses.

No fee was charged for any of these events, or for access to the congressman.

Our conclusion:

The state Democrats say that three Republican congressmen from Wisconsin are shutting down town hall meetings or making constituents pay to attend them. Yet all three had town hall meetings or participated in a forum -- in person, or by phone -- before the statement was made. And one, Duffy, participated in several town hall meetings.

In fact, one review showed many members of Congress did not have any town hall meetings -- and Democrats were less likely than Republicans to hold them. What’s more, the party provided no evidence Ryan or the others were not available to constituents during the break.

Finally, the assertion that appearing at a Rotary lunch that is open to the public is ""charging constituents"" for access is far off the mark.

The party’s claim is not only false, but ridiculously so. It’s Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/sep/06/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democratic-party-says-republican-represe/

Does commuter rail ease traffic?
","
The vote may be a year away, but politicians are already taking sides on a bid to raise taxes for more roads and rail in metro Atlanta.

If it passes, the 2012 transportation referendum would bring more than $6 billion for a regional project list for the gridlocked area, possibly including a new rail line between Cobb County and Midtown. So far, though, political leaders in car-centric Cobb are less than thrilled, according to an Aug. 23 article in The Marietta Daily Journal.

State Senate Majority Leader Chip Rogers is thinking about voting ""no"" on the 1-percent, 10-year sales tax.

""We know that rail offers some things that you can't get from just building roads, but we also know that rail doesn't do a great job in lessening traffic,"" Rogers said. ""And at a time when we need traffic to be lessened significantly, I don't know that we would put 55 percent of all our resources into that alone.""

Rogerswas referring to the 55 percent-45 percent split for mass transit -- which includes rail and buses -- to roads in the metro Atlanta project list for the 2012 transportation referendum. The list is a draft that faces further approval.

Rogers, whose Woodstock district also includes portions of Cobb County, expanded on his remarks in an email to PolitiFact Georgia. He cited a number of studies to make his point.

""While I readily admit that transit may have a number of benefits that should be considered for infrastructure investment, relieving traffic congestion is not one of the major benefits,"" he wrote.

Rail doesn’t do a great job of reducing traffic? Doesn’t rail get cars off the roads?

Transportation experts said that rail’s impact is difficult to suss out. Congestion is influenced by so many variables, including population growth, the economy and geography, that researchers differ on rail’s exact impact.

On its face, the problem seems simple. If a person who commutes alone by car takes the train instead, then that’s one less car on the road.

But multiple experts told PolitiFact Georgia that even if thousands of drivers take the train rather than a major road, congestion on that road doesn’t end.

It might drop initially, but travelers soon notice the better traffic. Commuters who once avoided the road return. Others take additional trips, or start using it during peak traffic times. People who carpooled start commuting alone.

Eventually, congestion returns, said Anthony Downs, a Brookings Institution fellow who has studied traffic congestion for decades. He thinks congestion is extremely hard to avoid, and will likely grow worse. Brookings is a liberal-leaning think tank.

Rogershas a point, he said.

""He is correct, but he is stating it very simply,"" Downs said.  

For instance, a 2009 University of Toronto study that analyzed interstate highway and vehicle travel data across the U.S. found there is little evidence that additional public transit reduces traffic. Other researchers have come to similar conclusions.

But there’s another important side to the traffic conundrum, and Rogers didn’t address it.  Decades of research shows that additional highway lanes don’t end gridlock, either. As with rail, drivers fill up the new lanes. Once again, they’re stuck in traffic.  

""Nothing solves the congestion problem. Neither option [cars or rail] takes precedent,"" said Catherine Ross, director of Georgia Tech’s Center for Quality Growth. A past board member of the Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority, she thinks rail can create better commutes and improve a region’s overall quality of life.  

Some experts told PolitiFact Georgia that this does not mean rail has no chance of impacting traffic. Downs noted that if a city built a rail line alongside a major roadway with stops at busy exits, it could have a shot.  

And University of California at Berkeley Professor Robert Cervero said that such a line can have an especially big impact on congestion during rush hour because research shows rail carries a large share of travelers during those times.

Indeed, a 2003 report published by the World Bank on 14 cities suggests that transit, including rail, does have a modest impact on congestion. People drive even less if a city has many characteristics that make using transit more attractive, such as high density and easy access.

One expert argued that rail could have a major impact on traffic. Professor Vukan Vuchic, a University of Pennsylvania professor of city and regional planning, said that a long-term transportation and development plan that encourages drivers to use transit and makes it inconvenient to drive could reduce congestion.

And speaking of inconvenient places to drive -- consider New York City. Experts noted that its rail helps the city accommodate far more travelers than the roads could. This avoids gridlock that those travelers would create.

In the end, though, the bulk of the experts we interviewed agreed that the one tested way to cut down on gridlock is ""congestion pricing."" That’s when drivers pay a surcharge to use roads during peak traffic hours. Cities such as London and Singapore have used the strategy and eased downtown traffic.  

How do we rule?

Rogers’ claim was that rail ""doesn't do a great job in lessening traffic,"" and there is a great deal of truth to this.

A rail line can do many things. It can take drivers off the road. A well-designed line has a shot at impacting congestion. And if a city or neighborhood is especially dense and designed around rail, it can’t prosper without it.  

But rail alone cannot end congestion. A few experts argue that it does little to nothing.

That said, Rogers left out an important fact that might have opened his take on the transportation tax to obvious criticism: No increase in capacity -- not even the construction of new road lanes -- can end congestion. Roads and rail have similar effects.

Rogers’ statement is accurate, but could have used a little more context.

Fox News’ Jeanine Pirro wrongly claims US border is ‘open to anyone from anywhere’
","Fox News host Jeanine Pirro accused President Joe Biden of having ""surrendered our southern border,"" falsely claiming the new administration is allowing anyone to cross freely into the U.S.  ""It is now open to anyone from anywhere in the world who wishes to enter our country, leaving one to wonder whether America is a sovereign nation anymore or a simple globalist landing spot,"" Pirro said in a March 20 TV segment, which circulated widely on Facebook.  The clip was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The number of migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico has swelled in recent months. But the border is not open for anyone to cross, immigration experts said, despite Pirro’s claim, which suggested that there is no legitimate enforcement at the border. ""That claim is patently absurd,"" said Nicole Hallett, an associate clinical professor of law and the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago. ""The border has never been ‘open to anyone from anywhere in the world who now wishes to enter our country.’"" U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows that most migrants they encounter arriving at the southern border are still being immediately expelled under a section of federal law former President Donald Trump invoked in March 2020 to curb the spread of COVID-19. In February, about 72% of the encounters CBP recorded at the border resulted in such expulsions.  ""The border is not open, and the vast majority of people are being returned under Title 42,"" CBP said in a statement, referencing the name of that section of law. The Department of Homeland Security said Pirro’s claim was false. ""There are few exceptions to this closure,"" including unaccompanied minors, added Erin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School. ""Jeanine Pirro’s claim that the border is open to anyone is absurd and reckless."" Asked for evidence, a Fox News spokesperson pointed to Pirro’s own comments March 22 on the program ""The Five,"" when she said she had spoken to sheriffs from locations near the border. ""I’m telling you for a fact, the border is open,"" Pirro said. ""I stood there with a sheriff who showed me where they stopped the wall."" Pirro did not provide evidence for her original claim on that show either. She instead argued that due to Biden, ""there is no border, there is no wall."" However, Biden’s move to stop construction of Trump’s border wall did not include dismantling what was already built.  A U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle is seen next to migrants after they were detained and taken into custody, Sunday, March 21, 2021, in Abram-Perezville, Texas. (AP/Cortez) The Biden administration is expelling most families and single adults encountered at the border using the same public health rule that Trump invoked during the pandemic, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said in a March 16 statement.  Roughly 90% of single adult encounters that the Border Patrol recorded between ports of entry resulted in such expulsions, for example, according to CBP data. However, the administration is not expelling unaccompanied children, who were previously being expelled under the Trump administration until a federal judge halted the practice in November. An appeals court in January said that the government could resume the practice, but the Biden administration has not. Their arrivals have contributed to the current influx at the border. Unaccompanied minors are allowed to request asylum under U.S. law, Barbato noted. In cases where Mexico cannot receive migrant families sent immediately back from the U.S., border officials are sending those families into immigration proceedings, putting a strain on some regions of the U.S., Mayorkas said in his March 16 statement. But Mayorkas has repeatedly said — including during a March 17 congressional hearing  and a March 21 interview with ABC News — that the border is not open.  Before the pandemic, many migrants who arrived without a visa were swiftly deported in what are known as expedited removal proceedings, Hallett said. Only those who credibly claimed fear of persecution were cleared to stay in the U.S. while they pursued their asylum claims.  ""Now, even fewer people are being allowed to enter the U.S. because Border Patrol is using a CDC regulation to expel almost everyone, even people who claim fear,"" Hallett said of the use of the public health-related authority. ""Pirro’s statement has no basis in fact."" The Biden administration has started gradually letting in asylum seekers who were waiting out their cases from Mexico under Trump’s Remain in Mexico program, but the Border Patrol has continued apprehending some migrants caught trying to enter the U.S. unlawfully between ports of entry. CBP recorded 26,791 apprehensions in February. Migrants apprehended at the border are screened for health and security issues, PolitiFact has reported. Mayorkas told Congress March 17 that known and suspected terrorists, for example, are denied entry based on intelligence and vetting procedures. ""Individuals who pose a public safety threat will not remain in the United States,"" he added. There were also 1,537 cases in February in which migrants sought to enter the U.S. through legal ports of entry but were deemed inadmissible, according to CBP data. There are many reasons why people seeking legal entry may be declared inadmissible, Hallett said. They could, for example, have criminal histories or suspected ties to terrorism, certain infectious diseases, or a previous deportation on record. ""These grounds of inadmissibility were in effect before the pandemic,"" Hallet said. ""Now, it is even more difficult to gain admission to the U.S. because of the public health-related restrictions. The idea that the U.S. is letting in criminals and terrorists at the border is just false."" Pirro said the southern U.S. border ""is now open to anyone from anywhere in the world who wishes to enter our country."" That’s wrong. Large numbers of migrants are attempting to cross the border, but it is not open to anyone who wants to enter the U.S., regardless of their background. Most of the encounters that CBP recorded at the border in February resulted in quick expulsions under the same public health-related authority that was invoked under the Trump administration.

Since 2017, the federal government has constructed about 455 miles of barriers along the nearly 2,000-mile southern border, including in the U.S. Border Patrol’s El Paso and Rio Grande Valley sectors, with about 209 more miles under construction. Most of that was to replace existing structures that were outdated or in disrepair.

Planned construction on more than 120 miles of barrier northeast of there hasn’t begun.

The picture is real, she said, but the sign is at a Maverik store that hasn’t opened yet.  When it does open and customers are able to buy gas there, it will reflect the correct price.

Roy Blunt miscasts how H.R. 1 would reshape the Federal Election Commission
","Republicans have expressed universal opposition to H.R. 1, a bill to overhaul election and campaign finance procedures that passed by the House with only Democratic support. The bill now awaits consideration by the Senate. One Republican senator, Roy Blunt of Missouri, cited a specific provision in the bill during an interview on the March 22 edition of NBC’s ""Meet the Press.""  Under the bill, Blunt said, ""there's a partisan Federal Election Commission, where for the first time ever, instead of being an equal number of Republicans and Democrats, it's three of one side and two of the other."" Is Blunt correct that the FEC — which enforces federal campaign-finance laws — would shift from a body divided evenly by party to one where one party has a 3-to-2 edge? No, although there are some wrinkles worth noting. Under current law, the FEC has six commissioners — three aligned with Democrats and three aligned with Republicans. Given partisan polarization, this has meant continued gridlock, as well as long stretches where new commissioners aren’t confirmed, leaving the FEC short of a quorum for significant actions. ""For far too long, the FEC has been plagued by dysfunction because a bloc of commissioners has taken a hands-off approach to enforcing the laws we have on the books — laws that are designed to prevent corruption and the appearance of corruption,"" said Danielle Caputo, legislative affairs counsel at Issue One, a campaign-finance advocacy group.  This history is what led the drafters of H.R. 1 to propose an alternate design for the commission.  Under the bill, the FEC would be ""composed of five members appointed by the president by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, of whom no more than two may be affiliated with the same political party."" (This means they would be Senate-confirmed.) The fifth, unaffiliated member could not, for a five-year period before their nomination, be registered with one of the two major parties; work or consult for one of the parties; or be a donor, officer, or attorney with one of the parties or its candidates or officials. Officially, the president would make nominations, but each commissioner, including the unaffiliated commissioner, would be brought to the president’s attention by a ""Blue Ribbon Advisory Panel that includes individuals representing each major political party and individuals who are independent of a political party and that consists of an odd number of individuals selected by the President from retired Federal judges, former law enforcement officials, or individuals with experience in election law."" The idea ""is to put a professional civil servant in charge instead of — to put it bluntly — a political hack,"" said Eliza Newlin Carney, a veteran campaign-finance journalist in Washington. Because the language of H.R. 1 specifically requires that no party control more than two of the five seats, the scenario Blunt laid out — ""three of one side and two of the other"" — could not come to pass. Blunt’s characterization ""is not accurate,"" Caputo said. ""A restructured FEC would not just be one party versus the other. There would likely be two Democratic commissioners, two Republican commissioners, and one independent/unaffiliated commissioner, preventing any side from holding the majority or the agency from becoming partisan."" Katie Boyd, a spokeswoman for Blunt, said that having an unaffiliated commissioner is no guarantee of preventing a 3-to-2 edge. ""The FEC currently has an ‘independent,’ Steven Walther, who was former Democratic Sen. Harry Reid’s attorney"" and whom Axios recently described as being ""widely considered a Democrat-aligned vote,"" Boyd said. Boyd also pointed to a letter signed by nine former FEC commissioners that casts doubt on the degree of ""deadlock"" and its impact on campaign-finance enforcement. ""The complaints about ‘deadlocks’ come from the regulatory activists who haven’t gotten their way,"" the letter says. ""They now seek to change the bipartisan nature of the commission, to smooth the path for agency adoption of the more expansive regulations they have unsuccessfully sought for years. Congress has consistently declined to adopt those expansive objectives."" The nine former commissioners said a switch would be ""ruinous."" ""In rule-making, the FEC’s bipartisan structure is a beneficial feature, not a defect. It demands that commissioners work to reach consensus and compromise on measures to achieve bipartisan support. If Congress wanted to destroy confidence in the fairness of American elections, it is hard to imagine a better first step than to eviscerate the FEC’s bipartisan structure."" Others, however, say that it wouldn’t be hard to find an open-minded, genuinely non-partisan fifth member. ""According to Gallup, more than 40% of Americans are independents,"" said Caputo. ""The Blue Ribbon Panel created by this legislation would help the president find nominees who are both fully committed to upholding our nation’s campaign finance laws and truly unaffiliated with either Democrats or Republicans."" Blunt said that under  H.R. 1, the FEC ""for the first time ever, instead of being an equal number of Republicans and Democrats (would be) three of one side and two of the other."" H.R. 1 would reduce the number of FEC commissioners from six to five. But the bill says that ""no more than two"" of the five members ""may be affiliated with the same political party."" The fifth member would be unaffiliated with either of the two major parties. So Blunt’s claim of a 3-2 split cannot come to fruition.  However, it’s worth pointing out that assuring that the fifth member will truly be independent requires some trust. If a fifth member did make it through the vetting process but later showed partisan leanings, the newly five-member commission could for the first time in its history enforce policy without bipartisan support.

The COVID-19 vaccines do not contain aluminum
","As millions of Americans continue to wait for their turn to be vaccinated against the coronavirus, misinformation about the vaccines’ safety continues to circulate online.   A year-old video shared on Instagram makes false claims about the vaccines’ ingredients. The caption of the post describes the featured video as a ""Sunday school church lesson,"" claiming aluminum is ""in the vaccine"" and ""will kill"" the brain. Many users interpreted that to mean harmful amounts of aluminum are in the COVID-19 vaccines. That isn’t true. The three-minute video involves Lawrence Palevsky, a pediatrician from Northport, N.Y., speaking about the dangers of vaccinations during a public health hearing held by the Connecticut General Assembly on Feb. 19, 2020. Palevsky, who is involved in the anti-vaccination movement, claims that aluminum nanoparticles in vaccines are able to enter the brain and cause neurodevelopmental problems, asthma, autism and Alzheimer’s disease. He also says the safety of aluminum nanoparticles in vaccines and its effects on the human body has not been evaluated or studied. This is inaccurate. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reports small amounts of aluminum, specifically aluminum salts, have been used in vaccines since the 1930s. The aluminum acts as an adjuvant, which helps elicit a stronger immune response from the body. The CDC says vaccines containing adjuvants like aluminum are ""tested for safety and effectiveness in clinical trials before they are licensed for use in the United States, and they are continuously monitored by CDC and FDA once they are approved."" Aluminum is commonly found in nature, with trace amounts present in air, food and water, according to the agency. Adults on average ingest 7 to 9 milligrams of aluminum per day, and the amount found in a vaccine is equivalent to that found in a liter of baby formula, according to Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Research has also shown the levels of aluminum found in vaccines are so low that they can't easily be absorbed by the body, let alone the brain. There has been no evidence of vaccines being the cause of illness of developmental disorders. Palevsky’s comments came in February 2020, long before we had COVID-19 vaccines. But it’s worth noting that none of the three COVID-19 vaccines currently being used in the United States contain any amount of aluminum. All three manufacturers, Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson, have shared the ingredients list to their vaccines and none have an aluminum adjuvant. The Sputnik V and AstraZeneca vaccines, which are currently being used in Europe, also do not contain aluminum. A year-old video being reshared on Instagram claims that aluminum nanoparticles in vaccines cause a variety of illnesses and developmental disorders. The caption implies the COVID-19 vaccines also contain aluminum and contribute to health issues. Although several vaccines do contain a miniscule amount of aluminum, research has found it’s not enough to be absorbed by the body. Humans already ingest amounts of aluminum just by living their everyday lives as it can be found in food, water and the air. There is no evidence that any vaccine can cause people to experience illnesses or developmental disorders. None of the COVID-19 vaccines currently in use throughout the United States and Europe contain aluminum.   The claim is False. ​",/factchecks/2021/mar/22/instagram-posts/instagram-post-suggests-covid-19-vaccines-contain-/

Post misleads on Biden, National Guard and hotel rooms for migrants

Since the Jan. 21 incident, social media users have spread unsubstantiated rumors alleging that specific politicians were responsible for pushing the National Guard troops out of the Capitol.  A March 21 Facebook post takes that false claim and adds a new twist: ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris forced our troops to sleep on the floor of a garage, yet has authorized $89 million for hotel rooms for illegal immigrants, who broke the law to get into this country,"" it says.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The troops were stationed in the Capitol amid fears that new violence would occur after the attack on the building on Jan. 6, 2021. However, there is no evidence that Biden, Vice President Harris or members of the Biden administration ordered the National Guard down to the garages.  The exact reasons for the National Guard’s relocation are murky. Separate organizations have reported conflicting statements about who requested the move.  But National Guard spokesperson Wayne Hall told PolitiFact that the order to relocate did not come from the new president or vice president. Asked Monday about the incident, Hall said the Guard now believes it came as a request from a Capitol Police officer, who was not acting at the behest of anybody in authority. Politico and other outlets, including the Associated Press and the Washington Post, also reported Jan. 21 that the National Guard said the instruction to relocate came from a Capitol Police officer. But in a statement released the morning of Jan. 22, Acting Capitol Police Chief Yogananda Pittman denied responsibility for the order, saying that with the exception of specific times on Inauguration Day, Capitol Police ""did not instruct the National Guard to vacate the Capitol Building facilities."" ""The Department is also working with the Guard to reduce the need for sleeping accommodations by establishing shorter shifts,"" Pittman said, ""and will ensure they have access to the comfortable accommodations they absolutely deserve when the need arises."" According to the New York Times, Biden called Gen. Daniel R. Hokanson, the chief of the National Guard Bureau, on Jan. 21 to express his dismay about the incident and ask what he could do to help.  The second part of the claim, that the White House has authorized $89 million for hotel rooms for people who enter the country illegally is missing context.  Axios has reported that the Biden administration awarded an $86 million contract to use hotel rooms to provide shelter and processing services to around 1,200 migrant family members, citing unnamed officials from the Department of Homeland Security. The president of Endeavors, the Texas nonprofit that got the contract, confirmed the news to Fox.  However, the use of hotels near the border to house migrants is not a new development. Previous administrations, including the Trump administration, have used hotel rooms to house children and families who enter the country illegally.  A Facebook post says, ""Joe Biden and Kamala Harris forced our troops to sleep on the floor of a garage, yet has authorized $89 million for hotel rooms for illegal immigrants, who broke the law to get into this country."" There is no evidence that Biden and Harris ordered the National Guard to relocate from the Capitol to parking garages. The Guard told PolitiFact that the request to move the troops is believed to have come from a Capitol Police officer.  Axios and Fox have reported that the Biden administration awarded a contract to use hotel rooms to provide shelter and processing services for migrant families. The contract was for a little less, $86 million, and the Biden administration is not the first administration to use hotels near the border to house children and families who enter the country illegally.  This claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.  Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/mar/22/facebook-posts/no-evidence-joe-biden-ordered-national-guard-parki/

It included a list of criteria for determining the risk of spreading COVID-19 and actions amusement parks could take to mitigate that risk.  That criteria included the ability to accommodate people wearing face coverings at all times, the ability to physically distance from people from different households, and the ""ability to limit activities known to cause increased spread (e.g.: singing, shouting, heavy breathing; loud environments will cause people to raise voice).""  But the plan isn’t advocating for amusement parks to limit shouting or screaming bloody murder on your way down Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.  The plan suggested ways to limit the risks posed by shouting: ""Face covering usage and/or modifications to seat loading patterns will be required on amusement park rides to mitigate the effects of shouting."" The CBS News affiliate in Los Angeles was among the news outlets to report that theme parks may be required to ask visitors not to scream on rides — and soon corrected its story.

Va. teachers pay ranks last in U.S. compared to full-time, year-round workers
","""If you look at the average teacher pay compared to the average pay of your citizens, Virginia ranks last,"" he said during a March 10 virtual meeting with the Smith Mountain Lake Democrats. ""We’re 50th out of 50 states. That is a disgrace."" We fact checked McAuliffe’s statement and found it on the mark. McAuliffe was governor from 2014-2018 and stepped down because Virginia is the only state that bars its governor from serving successive terms. He faces four opponents in a June 8 Democratic primary, all of whom are also promising to increase teachers’ pay. Renzo Olivari, McAuliffe’s campaign spokesman, said McAuliffe’s claim is based on an article posted in August 2020 in business.org., a website that offers information and product reviews aimed at small businesses. The article was headlined, ""The Best and Worst States for Teachers."" It compared each state’s average teacher’s salary in the 2018-19 school year to its average 2019 salary for all full-time, year-round employees. Average teacher salaries were taken from data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics; average employee salaries came from the U.S. Census Bureau. Virginia’s average teacher salary of $52,466 was 28% lower than the $72,833 average of all full-time workers - the largest discrepancy in the nation. That backs McAuliffe’s claim. But one potential problem remained. The Census Bureau updated its 2019 average employee salary figures after the article ran. So we ran the new numbers against the teacher pay data. Virginia still had the largest discrepancy or, as McAuliffe says, was last in the nation. The average pay of full-time, year-round employees was $73,890 - 29% higher than the average teacher salary of all workers. Nationally, the average for full-time employees was $67,787 compared to $61,730 for teachers - a 9% difference.  Virginia has the 8th highest average salary for full-time workers and ranks 34th in average teacher pay. McAuliffe says the discrepancy shows that the state has the wealth to raise its teachers’ salaries, and he pledges to lift them ""above the national average within four years."" Some legislators over the years have offered a similar argument for why Virginia can afford more spending, pointing to its status as a relatively low-tax state. Despite its wealth, Virginia ranks 36th in its average state and local tax burden, at 8.7% of income, according to USA Today.  McAuliffe estimates his four-year plan to raise teacher salaries by at least $9,200, when fully phased in, would cost about $800 million annually. We asked if it would require a tax increase and his campaign spokesman replied, ""Terry will consider multiple revenue streams to fund this critically important issue, including the hundreds of millions in new revenue Virginia will see from marijuana legalization and new casino revenues. Additionally, Gov. (Ralph) Northam recently announced that our economy is rebounding faster than expected and because of that we’re expecting to see hundreds of millions of dollars in additional revenues.""  A bill that would have raised teacher salaries to at least the national average over five years died this winter in the House Appropriations Committee. The increase, when fully phased in, would have cost the state $755 million a year, according to the Department of Planning and Budget.  Despite the failure of the bill, legislators agreed to a 5% teacher raise for the 2021-22 school year. Our ruling McAuliffe said, ""If you look at the average teacher pay compared to the average pay of your citizens, Virginia ranks last."" During the 2018-19 school year, the pay for a Virginia teacher was $52,466 and the average salary of a full-time, year-round worker was $73,890. The 29% discrepancy was the highest in the nation. So, we rate McAuliffe’s statement True.  ",/factchecks/2021/mar/22/terry-mcauliffe/va-teachers-pay-last-compared-full-time-year-round/

No, you don’t need a WHO vaccination certificate to travel internationally
","A popular TikTok video said that if you want to travel abroad after getting the COVID-19 vaccine, you’ll need a passport. But not just any passport. ""You will need a WHO Yellow Vaccination Passport if you plan on traveling internationally once borders open,"" says the caption on a March 17 post. The video, which had more than 80,000 shares before it was removed, featured a TikTok user who said he works at ""an international airline."" He said cards issued by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to Americans who receive the coronavirus vaccine aren’t sufficient to gain entry into other countries. ""They’re not cutting it, because they’re easily forgeable and they’re administered by the CDC, which is an American organization that other countries don’t necessarily recognize,"" the user said in the video. ""What is recognized by every country in the world are documents that are administered by the World Health Organization."" Nearly a quarter of Americans have received at least one dose of the coronavirus vaccine, and President Joe Biden has said that at the current pace, the country could return to some degree of normalcy by July 4. So we wanted to take a closer look at the TikTok post’s claim about proof of vaccination for travelers. (Screenshot from TikTok) The video is wrong — COVID-19 vaccination is not required to travel abroad. While some countries have started to check for proof of vaccination for travelers to avoid quarantine and testing requirements, the documents are not required as a condition of travel, and the WHO has advocated against requiring vaccination before travel. In the video, the TikTok user held up a yellow document. He said the WHO sells the vaccination passport on its website, and that ""you will need a doctor to sign and stamp this in order to make it valid""  The yellow document is the WHO’s International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis, which was created following the passage of the International Health Regulations in 2005. The passport-size vaccination record includes pages that ""must be signed in the hand of the clinician … supervising the administration of the vaccine or prophylaxis."" You can download and print one free online. The document is not directly related to COVID-19. ""Under the current legal provisions in the International Health Regulations (2005), yellow fever is the only disease for which proof of vaccination is a prerequisite for entry,"" a WHO spokesperson told PolitiFact. In February, the WHO published a position paper that said countries should not begin requiring proof of COVID-19 vaccination for departure or entry, ""given that there are still critical unknowns regarding the efficacy of vaccination in reducing transmission."" ""In addition, considering that there is limited availability of vaccines, preferential vaccination of travelers could result in inadequate supplies of vaccines for priority populations considered at high risk of severe COVID-19 disease,"" the WHO wrote. That recommendation is nonbinding, though, and some countries have started to implement their own COVID-19 vaccination policies for travel. Iceland, for example, has started allowing entry to passengers with proof of vaccination such as a WHO certificate. Without it, travelers would have to test negative for COVID-19.  Several other countries have similar policies. Sweden and Denmark are working on creating their own digital vaccination certificates, and Israel has issued its ""green pass"" to vaccinated citizens who want to access public amenities. (Consult the State Department’s website for a full list of country-level COVID-19 travel restrictions.) When asked in January if the U.S. could implement a COVID-19 vaccine passport system, Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Newsweek: ""Anything is on the table. Anything is possible, of course."" A TikTok post said: ""You will need a WHO Yellow Vaccination Passport if you plan on traveling internationally once borders open."" That’s not literally true.  International health regulations for travelers require inoculations only against yellow fever. The WHO has advised countries not to require COVID-19 vaccination as a condition of travel. However, some countries have started to check for proof of vaccination to avoid quarantine and testing requirements — and the WHO’s vaccination record can be used in some circumstances.

Does the American Rescue Plan limit how states can spend funds?
","After failing to stop the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 stimulus package from becoming law, Republicans are blasting the plan as a bailout for poorly managed Democratic states and cities. A key piece of the criticism has been the stipulation that $350 billion be siphoned off for state and local governments, money Democrats who pushed through the legislation with no Republican support argue will blunt the pandemic’s fiscal fallout. Rep. Mike Bost, a Republican from Murphysboro in southwestern Illinois, joined the national GOP chorus when in a WJPF radio interview he claimed there was nothing in the legislation limiting how states can spend the money. ""Where are the checks and balances in the issuing of these funds? Where is it that in there it says, it can only be used for A, B, C and D? It does not,"" Bost said. ""And that’s the problem."" The law — dubbed the ""American Rescue Plan"" by President Joe Biden — is more flexible than previous aid packages in how money can be spent, experts told us. But it’s also not a free-for-all. A relief bill passed last year, when Republicans controlled the White House and the U.S. Congress, earmarked $150 billion in state and local government aid for expenses tied only to the public health emergency. After last year’s law — dubbed the CARES Act — took effect, guidance from the federal Department of the Treasury explained funds could go beyond direct health care spending to cover items such as payroll for first responders and costs associated with caring for the homeless community. The text of the latest aid package sets more flexible guidelines, allowing state and local governments to spend on the pandemic’s ""negative economic impacts."" According to the language of the new law, funds can go toward increased pay for essential workers, preventing cuts to government services, and making investments in water, sewer, or broadband infrastructure as well. And unlike the 2020 CARES Act, it covers costs incurred through 2024. Bost spokesperson Alex Naughton, responding to our inquiry in an email, said the Democrats’ package lacks ""any meaningful guardrails"" for how state and local governments can spend the funds. ""They so loosely defined the terms of what’s an acceptable use of funds … that literally almost any expense could qualify,"" Naughton said. ""This effectively creates a slush fund to use on whatever they want, as long as they paste a ‘pandemic response’ label on the package first."" Experts agreed the new law provides considerable leeway, but they added that it does set some limits and outlines penalties for states and municipalities if they go beyond the legislation’s parameters. Specifically, state and local governments can’t use funds to make pension payments or offset lost revenue from state and local tax cuts enacted since March 3, 2021. In Illinois, the pension fund prohibition is particularly relevant given the state’s struggle to meet its pension obligations. Last April, Democratic state Senate President Don Harmon attracted national media coverage when he sent a letter to Illinois’ congressional delegation requesting $10 billion to help shore up the underfunded pension funds. The prohibition on direct pension spending doesn’t rule out the possibility the federal aid could free up other state money to shift toward pensions. Audit provisions in the law, however, spell out how states would have to return the money if they violate the spending restrictions. ""If something is found to be outside the scope of the program, the [state or local] government's on the hook to pay that back,"" said Amanda Kass, associate director of the Government Finance Research Center at the University of Illinois-Chicago’s College of Urban Planning and Public Affairs. Bost said the American Rescue Plan ""does not"" include ""checks and balances"" on how state and local government funds can be spent. Experts agreed the package is more permissive than previous state and local relief. It allows spending not only on public health but also on the economic impact of the pandemic as well as government services and infrastructure. But it still contains two big restrictions: the money cannot pay down pensions or fill in holes created by tax cuts. State and local governments also have to report how they spend the funds, and if they are found in violation must pay the money back. We rate Bost’s claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

No, COVID-19 relief law doesn’t give federal workers a $21,000 bonus
","The American Rescue Plan, the government’s newly passed $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief package, continues to be a target of misinformation about what exactly is included in the law. A recent Facebook post claims it includes a hefty bonus check for all federal employees. ""Pelosi’s $1.9 trillion bailout gives EVERY federal employee a $21,000 bonus check… they never lost their job!"" the post reads. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no bonus check. This appears to be a distortion of a limited-term provision in the package that provides additional paid family leave to some federal employees, covering leave that would otherwise be unpaid.  The $21,000 figure represents the maximum amount an eligible worker could receive in lieu of their pay if they took an emergency leave under certain circumstances. The bill established a $570 million pool called the Emergency Federal Employee Leave Fund to provide federal employees with up to 15 weeks of additional paid leave for COVID-19-related situations through Sept. 30. The Office of Personnel Management will oversee the program. The provision grants up to 600 hours in paid leave, capped at $1,400 per week (or a proportional amount for part-timers), for federal employees who cannot work because of the following reasons:  If they have to quarantine because of COVID-19;  If they have symptoms of the virus and are seeking a diagnosis; If they are caring for a family member with COVID-19;  If they are caring for a family member with a disability who can’t access other care because of COVID-19; If they are getting vaccinated or experiencing symptoms related to the shot; or If they are caring for a child enrolled in a school that isn’t fully open.  If an employee took all 15 weeks at the maximum $1,400 allotment, it would come out to the $21,000 that the Facebook post references. ""In most cases it wouldn’t make sense to do this unless you’ve exhausted your other options, including telecommuting, which many federal employees can do,"" Steve Ellis, president of the nonpartisan budget watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense, told PolitiFact. Federal workers can currently take up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave under the Family and Medical Leave Act, and a 2019 law allows most federal employees (about 2.1 million) to get 12 weeks of paid parental leave following the birth, adoption or fostering of a child. A Facebook post claims that the new COVID-19 relief package provides every federal employee with a $21,000 bonus check. There is no bonus check. The law provides money to cover paid leave for federal workers who say they can’t work due to certain COVID-19-related situations. The most an employee could claim under the provision is $21,000.

No, Black Lives Matter wasn’t charged with fraudulently spending donation money
","Social media users are wrongly claiming that an official Black Lives Matter organization was charged with committing wire fraud, laundering money and misusing donation money.

""Black Lives Matter of Atlanta Charged with Wire Fraud, Money Laundering and Allegedly Using almost 500k in Donations For Personal Use,"" said conservative commentator Chuck Callesto, a former Republican congressional candidate, in one such tweet posted March 16.

They were flagged as part of the platform’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The posts give the misleading impression that the wire fraud and money laundering charges were filed against an official chapter of the Black Lives Matter movement formed in 2013 after the fatal shooting of Trayvon Martin, a Black teenager, in Florida. But Black Lives Matter was not charged. The charges are actually against a 32-year-old activist named Sir Maejor Page, or Tyree Conyers-Page, according to the Justice Department. Page is accused of using a Facebook page called ""Black Lives Matter of Greater Atlanta,"" an illegitimate nonprofit, to defraud donors on the platform who thought they were supporting a legitimate social justice organization. Page created the Facebook account and registered ""Black Lives Matter of Greater Atlanta"" as a nonprofit organization in 2016, and he continued soliciting donations through Facebook after the group’s tax-exempt status was revoked for failure to submit required IRS forms for three years, according to the indictment against him. Prosecutors say Page misled Facebook users into believing their donations would be used to back protests in support of George Floyd and the Black Lives Matter movement. He received donations from more than 100 people through the Facebook page. He put thousands of dollars toward personal items, entertainment, hotel rooms and a house, the indictment says. The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, a charity created as an outgrowth of the Black Lives Matter movement, said in September that it was not affiliated with Page and that it rejected ""the extreme misleading behaviors of people who utilize our name for their own personal wealth and gain.""  ""Our stance remains that Mr. Page is not affiliated with Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation, nor is he an activist for the movement,"" the foundation told PolitiFact. Fox 5 Atlanta, a local TV station, reported in 2016 that Page had ""parted ways"" with the Black Lives Matter movement in Atlanta before starting his Facebook page.  A Twitter account for ""Black Lives Matter Atlanta"" posted two tweets that same year saying Page’s group was ""not a real chapter"" and ""not aligned w/ principles of BLM."" The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation confirmed that the Twitter account is legitimate. Using Facebook, PolitiFact messaged Callesto, who created the tweet that appeared on Facebook as a screenshot. After we reached out, he acknowledged that his tweet ""could mislead"" and posted a follow-up tweet in a thread under the original.  ""This tweet is missing CONTEXT,"" Callesto wrote in the March 18 update. ""It should read..  ‘Black Lives Matter of GREATER Atlanta’ Charged with Wire Fraud, Money Laundering... ‘Black Lives Matter of GREATER Atlanta’ refers to a(n) illegitimate nonprofit organization."" Callesto cited a Toledo Blade article about Page’s indictment. He said he had copied the original claim from a headline on a news site. But PolitiFact searched Google and the Nexis news database and did not find a headline that matched the language in his tweet. Conservative activist Jack Posobiec tweeted a similar claim while sharing a Daily Caller story about Page’s indictment.

Malliotakis makes mostly accurate claim about stimulus
","Rep. Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican from New York City, joined in the chorus of Republican criticism against the $1.9 trillion financial relief plan signed by President Joe Biden.  ""If you are a hard-working law-abiding citizen who earns $80,000, you don’t get a stimulus check,"" Malliotakis wrote on Twitter. ""But if you are a convicted murderer or rapist sitting in jail, you do."" The claim has been widely circulated. Is she right?   The American Rescue Plan Act, signed by Biden on March 11, provides a stimulus payment of $1,400 a person for those with incomes up to $75,000 if they file their taxes individually. For married couples, each spouse would get $1,400 if their combined income is $150,000 or less. Single filers earning slightly more than $75,000 will receive a smaller stimulus check, as will married couples earning slightly more than $150,000. But the law phases out the stimulus checks entirely for individual filers who earn $80,000 or more or a married couple making a combined $160,000 and filing jointly.  Mallitokis, who represents Staten Island and part of Brooklyn, made a claim about convicted murderers and rapists in jail. In most cases, people who are awaiting trial are held in jail, and people who have been convicted of serious crimes are in prison. In any case, the incarcerated are eligible for stimulus payments, as long as they meet the income limits and are legal residents or citizens. People who are in jail or prison could have income from pensions, investments or other sources.  PolitiFact fact-checked a similar claim -- that Democrats ""voted to give stimulus checks to criminals in prison,"" and rated it Mostly True. The fact-check found that Democrats rejected a Republican amendment that would have barred the checks for people in prison, and that in the past, both parties supported plans with direct payments to prisoners.  The CARES Act, an economic relief package signed by President Trump, also did not bar inmates from claiming the economic impact payment, said Janet Holtzblatt, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, who worked on tax issues at the Congressional Budget Office. The IRS, however, interpreted that law differently. Its decision was challenged, and a court ruling in October reversed the IRS position and allowed prisoners to receive the first round of payments, she said. We reached out to Malliotakis' office and did not hear back.  Her claim about jail inmates receiving stimulus payments is correct, as long as they are under the income limits. This was also true of the CARES Act, enacted under the Trump administration.  Because her claim is accurate but needs clarification and additional information, we rate it Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2021/mar/19/nicole-malliotakis/malliotakis-makes-mostly-accurate-claim-about-stim/

The claim echoes unsubstantiated allegations circulated more than a year ago by Rudy Giuliani, former President Donald Trump’s private lawyer, in an effort to discredit Biden’s anti-corruption efforts when he was vice president.  During Trump’s reelection campaign, Trump and Giuliani repeatedly misrepresented Biden’s efforts to oust a Ukrainian prosecutor accused of corruption, insisting that they were an attempt to shield Hunter Biden from prosecution — another claim we fact-checked and found unsubstantiated. On top of that, Giuliani on Oct. 10, 2019, told Fox News’ Sean Hannity that Burisma paid Joe Biden $900,000 in consulting fees when he was vice president.  Giuliani was parroting claims made in a press conference by Ukranian lawmaker Andriy Derkach. Derkach, according to the New York Post, said Burisma transferred the sum to Rosemont Seneca Partners, an investment firm co-founded by Hunter Biden. But he offered no evidence that Joe Biden got any money, the Post said. In a September 2020 investigative report on Bidens’ relationship with Burisma, the GOP-led Senate finance and homeland security committees referred to Derkach’s claim as ""foreign-sourced disinformation.""
