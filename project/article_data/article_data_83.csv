Cyber-squatter accuses Carly Fiorina of wishing she'd laid off 30,000 employees more quickly
","Carly Fiorina, the former CEO of Hewlett-Packard, announced on May 4, 2015, that she’d be running for president as a Republican. But a cyber-squatter had moved fast to grab the Web address carlyfiorina.org and flame her. Using a simple gray-and-white color scheme and uninspired fonts, the domain owner recalled Fiorina’s controversial six-year tenure as CEO of the computer maker by addressing visitors to the page this way: ""Carly Fiorina failed to register this domain. ""So I'm using it to tell you how many people she laid off at Hewlett-Packard. ""It was this many:"" At that point, a very long list of frowny-face icons begins. After much scrolling, the page concludes: ""That's 30,000 people she laid off. People with families. And what does she say she would have done differently? "" ‘I would have done them all faster.’ ""—Carly Fiorina"" Is the cyber-squatter -- who didn’t identify themselves on the site -- correct? The 30,000 number is largely accurate (we fact-checked it back in 2010), but we wondered whether it’s correct that Fiorina actually said she would have rather laid off people faster. First, some background. Fiorina was named CEO of Hewlett-Packard in July 1999, becoming the first woman to lead a Fortune 100 company. She reorganized the company's structure and pushed for a controversial 2002 merger with Compaq Computer Corp. in an attempt to get a greater share of the personal computer market. The merger succeeded, but HP's board fired her anyway in February 2005 (with a $21 million severance package), primarily due to the company's sluggish stock price and missed earnings targets. Her actions at HP spawned detractors as well as defenders. We looked at the numerical part of the claim in 2010, the year Fiorina ran unsuccessfully against incumbent Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif. The charge was made in an attack ad by Boxer. We found that Fiorina herself cited the 30,000-layoff figure in an interview with InformationWeek on Oct. 16, 2006. ""When we combined the R&D budgets of HP and Compaq, we didn't have to have two R&D teams working on industry standard servers, for instance. We could have one. That's why the merger was such a great idea. We could decrease the cost structure by billions and billions of dollars. In the course of my time there, we laid off over 30,000 people. That's why I understand where the anger came from."" Fiorina’s staff did not respond to an inquiry. Their official website, by the way, is www.carlyforpresident.com. But did Fiorina say that she wishes she’d done those 30,000 layoffs ""faster""? This is more problematic. It stems from a 2005 article in Fortune magazine (reprinted here in 2011). The comment came in a section devoted to the departure of some of the company’s senior executives after the merger. Here’s an excerpt: ""Fiorina summarily fired — within hours — the head of enterprise sales, Peter Blackmore, and two of his senior executives. The speed and visibility of the move caused the tech industry to view the firings as an unnecessarily cruel public hanging, and criticism of Fiorina flared. She argues back, saying that a hanging it wasn’t and that in truth these people were treated, in the usual HP manner, with ‘respect, candor, and compassion.’ But she also says that some of the European problems had been ripening for a time and that these three very senior executives clearly ‘dropped the ball.’ She believes in accountability, she says, so the men are gone. … ""Under Fiorina (HP) has lost — via firings, resignations, and retirements — a noticeable number of its top people. Here’s one indicator of what some people call the ‘brain drain’: Of the 11 ‘direct reports’ that Fiorina had in October 2003, one died and five others are gone. Michael Capellas, CEO of Compaq when the merger was done, left early. Former HP employees can also, without much effort, list another 20 well-placed executives who have departed, a few of them going to competitors Dell and storage company EMC. ""Fiorina does not agree, naturally, that there’s been a brain drain. In fact, she believes that one lesson she’s learned while running HP is that she should have moved more quickly in ejecting certain people. Smartened up now, she says, ‘I would have done them all faster. Every person that I’ve asked to leave, whether it’s been clear publicly or not, I would have done faster.’ "" This puts Fiorina’s comment in a somewhat different light. Rather than musing that she should have laid off 30,000 people faster, the full article suggests she’s referring to a select group of high-ranking executives. Our ruling The cyber-squatter site claims that after laying off ""30,000 people,"" Carly Fiorina said that in retrospect, ""I would have done them all faster."" While the number is accurate -- acknowledged in a 2006 interview by Fiorina -- the comment that ""I would have done them all faster"" is pulled out of context. In fact, Fiorina was more specifically referring to her decisions to force out a small number of top-level executives, not tens of thousands of rank-and-file employees. The claim is partially accurate, but takes some things out of context, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/may/05/anonymous-cyber-squatter/cyber-squatter-accuses-carly-fiorina-30000-layoffs/

More young black men in criminal justice system than college, presidential hopeful Ben Carson says
","Ben Carson -- who along with fellow Republicans Carly Fiorina and Mike Huckabee announced their candidacies for president this week -- made a provocative claim about young black men during a speech in Milwaukee on April 22, 2015.. Keynoting a fundraiser for an organization that tutors inner-city children, the retired Johns Hopkins Hospital neurosurgeon told the audience how schools and a strong mother helped lift him from poverty and brushes with crime. ""Many have said the young black male in America is an endangered species. Why do they say that?"" Carson continued. ""Because of the high homicide rate, particularly in our large, inner cities; because there are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than there are in higher education."" Are there more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than in college? Previous factcheck  To back Carson’s statement, a spokeswoman for his presidential exploratory committee initially cited a December 2014 factcheck from PolitiFact Rhode Island that touched on the first part of Carson’s statement. That factcheck was on a claim that there were more African-American men in prison or jail, or on probation or parole than were enslaved in 1850. Our colleagues rated it True. But that rating doesn’t help Carson’s claim, given that the figures pertained to all adult black males in the criminal justice system, rather than young ones. When we contacted the spokeswoman again, she cited statistics for black males ages 18 to 24, which would correspond to young black males in college. The statistics cited for involvement in the criminal justice system are from a U.S. Department of Justice report on arrests in 2010. But that report counted the number of arrests of black people, not the number of black people arrested. Some people, of course, get arrested more than once in a year. Aside from that, there’s also an issue with using arrests as a definition for being involved in the criminal justice system. There’s no dispute that someone who is in jail or prison, or is on probation or parole, is involved in the system. But many arrests go away without any criminal charges being filed. And not all charges result in convictions. ""Involvement in the criminal justice system is usually defined as being in prison or jail or being on probation, parole, or pretrial supervision,"" Craig Prins, research director of the Public Safety Performance Project at the Pew Charitable Trusts, told us. ""Even under that standard definition, it’s very difficult to say with certainty how these numbers stack up because the data rarely identify offenders across all three variables of age, race, and sex."" Indeed, as we’ll see, the federal government does not produce many criminal justice statistics that count black males ages 18 to 24. Criminal justice system We contacted the Department of Justice about Carson’s claim and were referred to several reports for the latest figures. Arrests: There were nearly 3 million arrests of black adults in 2012. (And again, that’s a count of arrests, not people.) But there is no breakdown for black males ages 18 to 24. Prison inmates: There were 526,000 black males in state and federal prisons in 2013. About 14.3 percent, or roughly 75,000, were between the ages of 18 and 24. Jail inmates: There were 261,500 black people in local jails in mid-2013. But there was no breakdown for the 18 to 24 age group. Probation and parole: More than 4.75 million adults of all races were on probation, parole, or some other type of supervision in 2013. But no breakdown by age is available. So, there is only one solid figure -- 75,000 black males ages 18 to 24 in prison. We’re not aware of any recent counts of the black males in that age group who were arrested, in jail, or on probation or parole at a particular time. Higher education  The higher education part of Carson’s claim is easier to sort out. The U.S. Census Bureau counts by race and with age breakdowns the number of people enrolled in school. For higher education, that includes full- and part-time students in universities and colleges, technical colleges and other institutions that award two-year degrees, and professional schools such as law schools that award advanced degrees. The latest figures, for 2013, show there were 690,000 males in college, ages 18 to 24, who listed black as their race. The number grows to 779,000 if you include males who identified themselves as black and some other race, such as Asian. Our rating Carson stated: ""There are more young black males involved in the criminal justice system than there are in higher education,"" later saying he was referring to the 18 to 24 age group. Carson did not provide evidence that backs his claim. The latest federal figures we found show 75,000 black males in that age group who were in prison in 2013 and in the range of 690,000 to 779,000 who were in college. We are not aware of any recent figures for the number of black males ages 18 to 24 arrested, in jail, or on probation or parole at any particular time. If figures do surface, we’ll re-evaluate this item, but we rate Carson’s claim False.  To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.",/factchecks/2015/may/05/ben-carson/more-black-men-criminal-justice-system-college-pre/
"['Nuclear', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says the United States is not modernizing its nuclear weapons
","U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., argues that the United States needs to do more to beef up its military to face down evil. Speaking at the Iowa Faith and Freedom summit on April 25, Rubio said that threats worldwide ""require strong American leadership, which we cannot exert as long as we eviscerate military spending, which is what we are doing now. We are placing our nation at a dangerous position."" Then he said this about the country’s nuclear stockpiles: ""We are the only nation that is not modernizing its nuclear weapons."" We wanted to know whether Rubio was correct that the United States isn’t modernizing its nuclear weapons, so we consulted with experts on U.S. nuclear policy. (We reached out to Rubio’s presidential campaign and Senate office and did not get a response.) Modernizing nuclear weapons Multiple experts told us that Rubio’s claim about nuclear weapons is wrong because ongoing and planned nuclear modernization efforts are extensive. The United States has been spending billions modernizing nuclear equipment -- and has plans to continue to do so. The National Nuclear Security Administration’s March 2015 report to Congress details plans to modernize nuclear equipment including various warheads over the coming years. A Congressional Research Service Report issued the same month covered similar topics. Modernization is  happening for many different types of nuclear programs, said Matthew Bunn, an expert on nuclear proliferation and a professor Harvard University. (During the 1990s, Bunn was adviser to the White House’s Office of Science and Technology Policy.) ""First, while we haven’t deployed major new strategic systems in some time, we’ve been modernizing the ones we’ve got more or less continuously — new rocket motors and guidance systems for the Minuteman missiles, lots of rebuilt parts for the B-52s, etc., etc. We’re in the middle of a $10 billion modernization of the B-61 bomb,"" Bunn said. These modernization plans are not cheap. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in January that the administration’s plans for nuclear forces would cost $348 billion over the next decade. During the next three decades, the cost to maintain the nuclear arsenal and purchase replacement systems could rise to more than $1 trillion, according to a 2014 report by the The James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies. The size of the U.S. stockpile has been declining since the 1960s and will decline further under the new START Treaty agreed to with Russia in 2011. But nuclear weapons can ""live"" for a long time. Several nuclear weapons introduced or upgraded in the 1990s or 2000s can be used for another 20 to 30 years, said Hans Kristensen, director of the Nuclear Information Project at the Federation of American Scientists. (Kristensen pointed to several upgrades in recent decades.) One analyst we spoke with had concerns that the upgrades aren’t happening fast enough. Tom Donnelly, a defense policy analyst at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, told PolitiFact that ""we are not really modernizing our nukes very seriously"" and that some projects are years -- even decades -- away and could could fall prey to budget cuts.   But Benjamin Friedman, an expert at the libertarian Cato Institute, said that even if some modernization plans were canceled, ""we would still be modernizing our nuclear arsenal or our nuclear weapons, just less of them. So any normal definition of ‘modernize,’ describes what the United States is doing with its nuclear weapons."" Rubio compared the United States to the rest of the world without naming any other countries when he said ""we are the only nation that is not modernizing its nuclear weapons."" Rubio said that the United States was ""the only nation"" not modernizing its weapons, but Bunn, the Harvard professor, said comparing the United States on that basis with other countries is misleading. China, for example, is modernizing its arsenal, but its arsenal is also far smaller. The United States and Russia have over 90 percent of the world’s nuclear weapons, he said. ""So I would say: (a) not true that we haven’t been modernizing at all; (b) IS (mostly) true that we haven’t bought any big new strategic delivery systems lately; (c) highly misleading not to mention that all nuclear powers other than ourselves and Russia have tiny nuclear arsenals compared to ours,"" Bunn said. Our ruling Rubio said that the United States ""is not modernizing its nuclear weapons."" Most of the experts we interviewed disputed Rubio’s statement. While the United States has reduced the number of warheads, it has also been modernizing nuclear equipment and has plans to continue to do so.

"['Military', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says the United States isn't building aircraft, bombers, nuclear subs
","With leaders in Iran, Russia and elsewhere flexing their military muscles, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., says the United States needs to ramp up its own military. ""We are the only nation that is not building the aircraft, the long-range bombers, the additional aircraft carriers, the nuclear submarines that we need for our national defense,"" Rubio said at the Iowa Faith and Freedom Summit on April 25, 2015. We separately fact-checked Rubio’s claim at the same event that the United States is not modernizing nuclear weapons. Here, we wanted to know whether Rubio is correct that the United States isn’t building the other military equipment. We interviewed spokespersons for the Air Force and Navy and other military experts about the current status of building planes, bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines. We contacted Rubio’s campaign and Senate offices and did not get a reply. We actually found a lot of evidence that the United States is spending on the types of military equipment Rubio mentioned. We’ll take it point by point. Nuclear submarines The Navy’s highest shipbuilding priority is the Ohio-Class Replacement program to build 12 ballistic missile submarines to replace the current force of 14. These submarines carry long-range missiles armed with multiple nuclear warheads. The Navy plans to replace the ships as they retire, beginning the first hull in 2021 and continuing to build through 2035. The Navy has budgeted $1.4 billion for research and design in fiscal year 2016 after a House panel authorized funding for it, but the challenge is funding the total program, which could cost as much as $139 billion. The Navy’s most recent budget request to Congress to build the first ship was for about $5.7 billion. Aircraft The Defense Department is in the middle of the largest aircraft procurement ever for different versions of the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter for the Air Force, Navy, and Marine Corps. The government started acquiring new airplanes in 2007, and the branches of the service are testing various versions. Full-scale production is expected to start around 2018. Plans call for acquiring a total of 2,443 over about 20 years at a cost of nearly $400 billion. Through fiscal year 2013, the F-35 program has received a total of roughly $83 billion of funding. The Defense Department’s budget for the current year includes $8.6 billion for 38 joint strike fighters and $11 billion for 57 in 2016. ""It is a quantum leap in technology compared to what we are currently flying,"" said Joe DellaVedova, a spokesman at the Pentagon for the F-35 program. ""The F-35 from a budget financial point of view has the full support of the Pentagon, and the Marine Corps is funding it, the Navy is funding it, the Air Force is funding it. It is a massive amount of money, a massive amount of jobs and a massive capability that is being delivered to the warfighter."" Aircraft carrier The Future Years Defense Program includes plans for one new aircraft carrier. The Defense Department budget for 2016 shows about $2 billion budgeted for this year and $2 billion for next year toward the cost of a Ford class aircraft carrier, which costs in total about $14 billion. ""The Ford Class will feature an array of advanced technologies designed to improve warfighting capabilities and allow significant manpower reductions,"" states the Navy’s budget. The lead ship of the first new class of aircraft carriers has been under construction since 2008. Bombers The Air Force has started a new bomber program, known as long-range strike bomber. The Air Force anticipates awarding a contract in the late spring with ""initial operational capability for the planned fleet of 80-100 aircraft in the mid 2020s,"" an Air Force spokeswoman told PolitiFact. But delays in awarding the contract prompted the House Armed Services Committee to reduce the funding by $460 million so the money could be reallocated elsewhere in 2016, according to an April 27 article in Military Times. The article stated that during the last few years, the Air Force has worked with defense companies on the research and technology phase and has made a $1 billion technology investment in the bomber. The 2016 budget also includes an array of modernization initiatives for different types of bombers that are used in nuclear and other missions. Experts The experts we spoke with agreed the United States is building aircraft, bombers, aircraft carriers and nuclear submarines. ""The U.S. is doing all of the things he says it is not doing -- literally all of them,"" said Todd Harrison, senior fellow of defense studies at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. ""These programs are (in many cases) works in progress, so they are not completed yet, but the programs are actively in progress."" While these plans are at various phases, research and development is moving forward, said Benjamin Friedman, a research fellow in defense and homeland security studies at the Cato Institute. A report by the James Martin Center for Nonproliferation Studies projected the total cost to modernize the nuclear triad at $1 trillion over 30 years raising questions about whether the government has a handle on the full costs and is willing to spend that much. Despite funding shortfalls, Friedman said that he thinks it is likely that the United States will proceed with plans to replace this equipment -- but  will muddle through with ""a combination of slowing procurement, ordering less platforms, dialing down requirements to keep down cost (especially for the nuclear armed submarines), maybe dropping the nuclear mission for the F-35s, and various other small steps to save."" We did find debate among the experts whether the building plans are moving forward quickly enough. Thomas Donnelly, a defense expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, says the United States is building too slowly and not building enough. He said the most immediately shortfall is attack submarines -- during the Reagan years, the United States built four per year, but that has fallen to one or two a year. ""Newer systems are more capable than the ones they replace, but they're not good enough to be in two places at once,"" he said. ""The world is big, and we have gotten in the habit of operating all over it."" Our ruling Rubio said that the United States ""is not building the aircraft, the long-range bombers, the additional aircraft carriers, the nuclear submarines."" The military has programs in place to build the types of equipment Rubio mentioned, including the largest aircraft procurement ever: the F-35 Joint Strike Fighter. It will take many years and billions of dollars to complete the procurement, but Rubio’s statement could mislead voters into thinking that the United States has closed up shop in the area of military equipment and isn’t building anything, which isn’t the case. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2015/may/05/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-says-united-states-isnt-building-aircr/
"['State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Van  Taylor']","
Van Taylor says Texas Senate sent largest tax cut in Texas history to House
","First-term state Sen. Van Taylor recently credited the Texas Senate with advancing a record tax cut. The Plano Republican’s March 25, 2015, press release, said he’d ""helped pass what, if enacted, would be the largest tax cut in Texas history through the State Senate,"" providing $4.6 billion in property and business tax relief. Taylor was among more than 20 Senate primary authors of Senate Bill 1, which with voter approval would amend the state’s mandatory homestead property tax exemption, which has been $15,000 since 1997. If adopted, the new variable exemption, equal to 25 percent of the statewide median home value, was predicted to save homeowners $206 on average in 2016 and $233 on average in 2017. Two other measures, each authored by more than 20 senators (including Taylor), reduced the state’s business franchise tax rate by 15 percent and exempted an additional 61,000 small businesses from it. Tax-cut history has been ballyhooed in Texas before. State leaders in the 1990s and again in 2006 declared history in the works when they drove down school property taxes — even though the homeowners who were supposed to benefit didn’t always notice reductions because school districts and other local governing bodies still raised tax rates and reaped more due to escalating property values. Stumping for president in fall 1999, then-Gov. George W. Bush ran TV ads in Iowa saying he’d ""signed the two biggest tax cuts in Texas history."" In 1997, lawmakers had proposed and voters approved the new $15,000 homestead exemption, up from $5,000 before. The two-year cost to the state of that move was pegged at $1.04 billion, according to a January 2015 report by the state comptroller’s office covering tax changes since 1972. In 1999, lawmakers funded local school property tax relief at a state cost of $1.4 billion in 2000-01, the report said. A billion here, a billion there, those reductions had far short of the projected two-year effect of the plans saluted by Taylor. 2006: $14 billion in relief Then again, in May 2006, the Republican-led Legislature and Gov. Rick Perry agreed to what was then touted as more than $6 billion a year in school property tax relief to be partly offset by revisions in the state’s business franchise tax, a $1-per-pack hike in cigarette taxes and tighter tax-reporting requirements for buyers of used cars. According to a May 2006 Austin American-Statesman news story, homeowners would benefit from the legislated one-third cut in maximum property tax rates for school operations. The owner of a $100,000 home was in for annual savings of about $145 starting in fall 2006 with the savings rising to $425 in fall 2007, the story said, though savings would be lessened if school boards inched up tax rates. On full implementation, the relief was projected to cost the state $14 billion every two years, according to a Legislative Budget Board chart published in 2012. So, the 2006 tax changes whomped the 1997 and 1999 cuts by the yardstick of projected state costs biennium by biennium. And, it appears, that $14 billion in intended relief also exceeded the $4.6 billion in relief predicted due to the Senate-passed proposals that Taylor described as record-setting. Taylor’s analysis We asked Taylor how he reached his conclusion. To our inquiry, Lonnie Dietz, Taylor’s chief of staff, said by email that Taylor relied on the comptroller’s 2015 report on tax changes since 1972 to gauge the legislated actions of 1997, 1999 and 2006. According to the report, Dietz noted, the school tax-rate cuts ordered in 2006 were projected to cost the state $3.9 billion through August 2007 and another $18.8 billion the next 24 months, money that would make up for lost local revenues due to the mandated rate cuts. Then again, the report said, the tax hikes approved to help fund those costs were predicted to generate more than $8 billion in the same period--making the 2006 actions a tax swap, not a pure cut, Dietz told us. Another thing: Dietz pointed out the lasting effect of the 2006 tax-rate action was to slow rather than reverse property tax increases. In 2008, a business group, the Texas Taxpayers and Research Association, compared 2007 school property taxes with what it calculated Texans would have paid without the legislated rate cut. The difference amounted to about $7 billion, it said. ""The average Texan's total property tax bill in 2007 was 20 percent lower than what it likely would have been had there been no tax relief initiative,"" the group said. Separately, the Texas Education Agency offered data to us in 2010 showing that collections for school maintenance and operations taxes were down 30.2 percent in 2007 compared with what the state projected they would have been without the rate cuts. Then again, taxpayers don't typically compare their tax bills to what they might have paid but to what they actually paid last time. And why didn't school taxes fall more between 2005 and 2007? At the time, Dale Craymer, TTARA’s president, gave two major reasons. The first was a provision in the 2006 tax overhaul giving school boards the option of raising the maintenance and operations rate by a few cents for enrichment purposes. By 2007, more than 1,000 Texas school districts had done so. That lessened the impact of the mandatory 33 percent rate reduction in those districts. The second, most powerful factor, Craymer said, was rising property values. If values rise proportionately more than tax rates are cut, savings are negated and tax bills go up. In both 2006 and 2007, the total taxable value of property in Texas rose more than 10 percent each year. Dietz also suggested we set aside property tax relief for comparative purposes because such taxes are locally set. If you do set aside property tax actions, he said, it’s clear the Senate’s 2015 measures shrinking the business franchise tax alone--SB 7 and SB 8--have a two-year savings to businesses of nearly $2.48 billion, according to legislative fiscal notes. ""So on its surface right there no other state tax cut in the history of Texas even approaches what the Senate passed with SB 7 and SB 8,"" Dietz wrote. The comptroller’s report lists about 10 instances of lawmakers revising the franchise tax from 1975 through 2013 including some expansions and hikes. There also were attempts to cut the tax or reduce who pays; none of those actions were projected to cut more state revenue from the franchise tax than the proposals celebrated by Taylor. Other views As we analyzed the senator’s statement, other questions arose. For instance: Biggest tax cut in history for whom? And: Biggest tax cut based on the impact over two years--or longer? The school property-tax reduction adopted in 1997, for instance, surely has cost the state much more than its initial two-year price tag. On the other hand, it doesn’t seem fair to compare many years of accumulated costs (and savings to homeowners) to the two-year expected impact of the latest Senate moves. We gathered other views. By email and telephone, Vance Ginn, an economist for the conservative Texas Public Policy Foundation, and Chris Bryan, spokesman for State Comptroller Glenn Hegar, each said the Senate-supported measures amount to the largest potential tax cuts in Texas history. Ginn stressed the 2006 school tax actions provided tax relief--stopping short of keeping taxes down. Like Dietz, he pointed out a chart in a December 2014 report by the state comptroller’s office indicating total school property tax collections decreased $2 billion in 2007 compared to the year before, but such taxes went up in 2008 and also increased all but one subsequent year through 2013.                A school finance expert We shared Ginn’s message about total school property tax collections bouncing up after going down for just one year after the 2006 changes with school lobbyist Joe Wisnoski, a former Texas Education Agency finance official. Wisnoski commented by email: ""Come back in a year, and I would imagine the same could be said about the Senate’s property tax cut of 2015."" He further speculated that likely increases in property values will outpace projected savings from the Senate plan (see his calculations here) leading him to predict no reduction in overall school property taxes levied for tax year 2015. ""That is not to say that the additional exemption"" for homesteads in the Senate plan ""is trivial,"" Wisnoski wrote, ""and I would never characterize it as anything other than a tax cut. But I don’t believe it to"" be ""larger than the 2006 rate reduction."" The 2006 law, he wrote, ultimately reduced school maintenance and operation rates by at least 22 percent; the maximum allowed M&O rate is lately $1.17 per $100 valuation, he said, compared to the $1.50 per $100 valuation in 2006. And district rates are even lower in some districts, Wisnoski indicated. Even factoring in districts that impose the state’s maximum debt-related tax rate of another $0.50 per $100 valuation, he wrote, the lingering percentage rate reduction would remain around 16.5 percent. Footnote: Weeks after Taylor made his claim, Texas House members approved proposed cuts in sales and business franchise taxes projected to cost the state $4.9 billion ($300 million more than the Senate’s plans) over two years--about $2.3 billion from shaving the state sales tax rate and nearly $2.6 billion from shrinking the franchise tax. The legislative session ends June 1, 2015. Our ruling Taylor said he ""helped pass what, if enacted, would be the largest tax cut in Texas history through the state Senate."" Senate-approved proposals reducing the business franchise tax promise a record slash in that tax. But together, the Senate measures reducing franchise and property taxes by about $4.6 billion over two years, what Taylor highlighted, add up to less tax relief than the school property tax-rate reductions legislated in 2006, which cost the state $14 billion every two years. Homeowners might not notice those changes partly due to escalating values. Still, the state-imposed ceiling on school operations tax rates remains 22 percent lower than what was in place before.

","A 2012 Q&A session between Bill Clinton and Ashley Judd has surfaced as evidence in the case against the Clinton Foundation and its acceptance of foreign donations while Hillary Clinton served as secretary of state. In the video, Clinton’s words seem hypocritical. Here’s how MSNBC host Joe Scarborough described it on his April 30, 2015, show. ""There is a clip of Bill Clinton saying we're not going to take foreign donations because if somebody had business before the State Department, there would be an appearance of impropriety,"" Scarborough said. ""They not only burst through what the guidelines of the White House put up, they burst through their own self-pronounced guidelines."" Scarborough is right that there's a video clip of Clinton dicussing foreign donations, but as this fact-check will show, he misleads viewers by saying it's a sign the Clintons burst through their ""self-pronounced guidelines"" of taking foreign donations.   What Bill Clinton said The 2012 interview took place at the London School of Economics. Clinton was asked by a fawning Judd about the creation of the Clinton Global Initiative -- which is, effectively, a subsidiary of the Clinton Foundation. Initiative projects range from paying for technology so that small stoves to charge cell phones, to loans for small businesses, to free Web ads to raise money for overseas development nonprofits. As often happens with Clinton, he gave a sidewinder of an answer. But here’s the relevant portion of his response for our purposes: ""The Clinton Global Initiative meets every year. Then we do one (meeting) just on the American economy, which we will continue to do until we reach full employment. We had one (meeting) in Hong Kong for Asia, which I had to suspend those while Hillary was secretary of state for good reason. In order to do one around the world and make the economics work and keep the entry fee fairly low, you have to have sponsors. And if your wife is secretary of state and you get sponsors in another country, they may be doing it just because they believe in it, but it opens up too many questions of conflicts of interest. So we suspended those. ""But if she leaves the State Department in January, then I expect we’ll have one in 2013 in Latin America and then another shortly thereafter in Asia because they’re interested in it."" As you can see, Scarborough’s comments aren’t out of thin air. But Clinton is talking specifically about the Clinton Global Initiative. That’s an important distinction, it turns out, because of the specific guidelines set out by the Clintons when Hillary Clinton was nominated as secretary of state.  A bevy of initiatives The Clintons (and we say Clintons to describe them as a group, but Hillary Clinton was walled off from the organizations as secretary of state) operate several separate initiatives under the umbrella of the Clinton Foundation.   While Hillary Clinton ran the State Department, the foundation oversaw the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative, the Clinton Climate Initiative, the Clinton Guistra Sustainable Growth Initiative and the Clinton Hunter Development Initiative. (The last one had nothing to do with hunting. It was named for Scottish entrepreneur Sir Tom Hunter and focused on development projects in Rwanda and Malawi.) The foundation still runs those different programs, although it has dropped the initiative label from some of them. The point is, the Clinton Global Initiative was one of a handful of programs under the foundation’s umbrella. The modus operandi of the Clinton Global Initiative is to act as a broker between donors and doers. It holds big meetings to bring together governments, donors, and non-governmental organizations with shared concerns. The initiative charges fees to join as members, seeks sponsors to hold these big meetings and then pushes members to make big dollar commitments to key projects. Brian Mittendorf, a professor of accounting at Ohio State University’s Fisher College of Business who follows nonprofit filings, including those of the Clinton Foundation, said that most of the money never passes through the Clinton Global Initiative’s hands. ""CGI (the Clinton Global Initiative) doesn't implement the projects but instead acts as a ‘facilitator’ to match donors and get commitments to action,"" Mittendorf said. ""So, those commitments are not reflected as donations to the Clinton Foundation or CGI."" To get an idea of the contrast, in 2011, the global initiative had $26 million in revenues, but boasted that it secured commitments of $7.39 billion for projects that would roll out over many years. The promises of the Clintons and the memorandum of understanding  So now we get to the Clintons ""self-pronounced guidelines."" When Hillary Clinton was nominated by Barack Obama as secretary of state in 2008, the Clinton Foundation instantly emerged as a stumbling block to her confirmation. The Obama transition team attempted to deal with the possible conflicts of interest with a memorandum of understanding between the Clinton Foundation and the new administration. That memo created different requirements for the Clinton Global Initiative and other Clinton entities. According to the memorandum, the Clinton Global Initiative would be spun off as a separate nonprofit entity that could take no money from any foreign government. In addition, the Clinton Global Initiative agreed not to hold any big meetings outside the United States. The other Clinton programs and initiatives could continue to accept money from foreign governments, but they had to report new donors or any existing government donor that decided to ""increase materially its commitment."" Memorandum terms
Clinton Global Initiative Memorandum terms
Clinton Foundation and other Clinton subsidiaries No donations from foreign governments Can accept donations from foreign governments, increased reporting requirements No large meetings outside the United States Foreign meetings allowed This, again, is key, because Clinton was speaking only of the Clinton Global Iniative in his 2012 remarks. Clinton Foundation spokesman Craig Minassian said the global initiative was treated differently because the initiative mainly brought funders together. As such, the global initiative did not need to collect money directly from foreign governments. In contrast, Minassian said, a program like the Clinton HIV/AIDS Initiative -- now called the Clinton Health Access Initiative -- ran projects that delivered health care to people in developing countries.  ""You couldn’t stop the money for AIDS because millions of people depended on that for their drugs,"" Minassian said. ""Those were programs we actually implemented. No one wanted to interrupt that because it would make no sense."" So why would the Clinton Global Initiative have any need at all for funds from foreign governments? Minassian said such help made large foreign meetings possible. ""You need to be invited. You need additional police and security,"" Minassian said. ""The host country is a key sponsor. This is not like holding a meeting at the Sheraton in New York City."" Minassian said that after a meeting in December 2008 in Hong Kong, the program limited its annual gatherings to New York City from 2009 to 2012, the years Hillary Clinton headed the State Department. The first meeting outside America took place about 10 months after she left. It was held December 2013 in Brazil. Foreign money did go to the Clinton Global Initiative The restriction on the global initiative applied specifically to foreign governments. However, the initiative could and did accept donations from foreign donors (Scarborough just said foreign donations, not donations from foreign governments). There are two ways to support the initiative. Membership costs $20,000 and comes with a ticket to go to the annual meeting. Sponsors pitch in substantially more to help pay for the meetings themselves. In return, they get publicity, multiple tickets to the meeting and other perks like their own meeting room at the annual gathering. The organization’s Internal Revenue Service filings show total revenues of $28.2 million in 2012 and $26 million in 2011. The split between member fees and sponsorships is unclear, but Minassian said those are the only two sources of revenues. In 2011, foundations backed by Ukrainian businessman Victor Pinchuk and Dubai-based Indian Sunny Varkey helped fund the annual meeting in New York. So did the French bank Credit Agricole and Indo Gold, an Australian mining company with investments in India, Africa and Germany. During Hillary Clinton’s confirmation hearings, senators raised concerns about any foreign entity, government or private, making donations to the Clinton Foundation. The policy for the Clinton Global Initiative that emerged from the memorandum only banned accepting funds from foreign governments, along with no longer holding large meetings outside America. Since Hillary Clinton left the State Department, the governments of Germany, Saudi Arabia, Australia, Oman, and others have given money to the global initiative. Minassian said that now that she is running for president, that will stop, as will plans to hold gatherings overseas. Our ruling Scarborough accused Bill Clinton of hypocrisy, saying the former president violated his own self-pronounced guidelines by accepting foreign donations while his wife was secretary of state. As evidence, Scarborough pointed to comments made by Clinton in 2012.  But Clinton's comments were more narrowly focused than Scarborough let on. Clinton said the Clinton Global Initiative didn’t take donations from foreign entities while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state because it opens questions of conflicts of interest. That prohibition is outlined in a memorandum of understanding signed by the foundation and the Obama administration. There is, as of yet, no accusation that the initiative broke that term of the agreement. As far as the other Clinton programs and initiatives, the Clintons were permitted to collect donations from foreign governments. But they did agree to increased reporting requirements, though the Clinton Foundation says it failed to meet the reporting requirements in some cases. In short, there are serious questions about how the Clinton Foundation reported foreign government donations. But Bill Clinton’s 2012 interview provides little extra fodder -- beyond a juicy soundbyte -- for those questioning the Clintons’ decision to take foreign government money. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/may/04/joe-scarborough/scarborough-clinton-foundation-broke-its-own-rules/

Mike Huckabee says he 'raised average family income by 50 percent' as Arkansas governor
","Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee is poised to join the fast-growing growing field of Republican presidential hopefuls for 2016. A video touting his potential as a candidate focuses on his economic record and his ability to beat the Clintons. In the video, Huckabee says in a voice-over that ""as governor of Arkansas, I cut taxes and welfare, balanced the budget every year for 10 years, and raised average family income by 50 percent."" (The video was officially released by a political action committee aligned with Huckabee called the Prosperity for All Fund on May 1, 2015.) That struck us as an impressive increase in incomes, even if it did come over a 10-year period. We wondered: Is it correct? Let’s start by looking at the numbers. When we reached out to Huckabee’s camp, they pointed us to data from the federal Bureau of Economic Analysis tracking per-capita personal income in each state. Huckabee served from July 15, 1996, to Jan. 8, 2007, so the campaign used data for Arkansas between 1995 and 2006. In 1995, the per-capita income figure was $18,555. By 2006, the figure had grown to $29,494. That’s an increase of 59 percent. Case closed? Not quite. It turns out that those figures aren’t adjusted for inflation. If you do adjust the 2006 figure for its value in 1995, per-capita income in the state would have increased to a more modest $22,296. That would produce a 20 percent increase over 10 years, not 59 percent. Granted, a 20 percent increase above inflation, even over 10 years, is a pretty good record -- but it’s not as eye-catching as the 50 percent Huckabee cited in the video. Indeed, when you break it down, 39 percent of the income increase Huckabee referred to came from inflation -- something he neither had control over nor would he want to claim credit for even if he did. Hogan Gidley, senior communications advisor to Huckabee, told PolitiFact, ""We stand by the fact: The average family income increased by 50 percent. That’s what’s said in the ad because that’s what happened."" There’s another aspect of Huckabee’s claim to look at: Is it reasonable for him to take credit for having ""raised average family income by 50 percent""? Note that he didn’t say he ""helped raise"" incomes; he said ""raised."" It’s a high bar to prove that his actions are the primary reason for the increase. Taking such a strong degree of credit is questionable since national and international economic conditions beyond the control of any one policymaker can have major impacts on a state’s economy, said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. Generally speaking, Sinclair said, ""governors cannot claim much of the credit for income increases on their watch."" One factor to look at is whether incomes in Arkansas rose faster than incomes nationally. And the answer is: They didn’t. Over the same period of time, incomes nationally rose by 62 percent without accounting for inflation, a few percentage points higher than the 59 percent under Huckabee in Arkansas. We’ll also note that in the ad, Huckabee touts his record of cutting taxes and balancing the budget, yet advocates of free-market economics have generally been cool toward Huckabee’s record on taxes and spending as governor. Every two years, the libertarian Cato Institute rates each governor on their adherence to low-tax, low-spending principles. Huckabee’s grade from Cato was initially a B, but with every biennial report his grade never improved, moving to C, C, D and finally to F. Cato cited increases on his watch in sales taxes, a 3 percent income-tax surcharge and a 25-cent cigarette tax increase. (Earlier in his term, it noted, Huckabee did implement a $70 million tax cut package and a bill to cut the state’s capital gains tax.) As for balancing the budget, state law requires the governor to submit a balanced budget and for the legislature to pass one. ""I am hard-pressed to recall any specific policy initiatives that can clearly be credited with raising incomes,"" said Hal Bass, a political scientist at Ouachita Baptist University in Arkadelphia, Ark. ""He was governor during a time of general national economic expansion, so I think there was a rising tide effect in place."" To the extent that Huckabee’s policies may have aided incomes in the state, Bass added, it may have stemmed from his initiatives on health and education. For instance, Huckabee implemented the ARKids health insurance program, which leveraged federal and tobacco-settlement funds to expand health insurance to for low-income children, something that may have ""kept poor families from being overwhelmed by medical expenses,"" Bass said. Our ruling Huckabee said he ""raised average family income by 50 percent"" during his tenure as Arkansas governor. Once you account for inflation, Huckabee is incorrect. Income in Arkansas increased 20 percent, not 50 percent. That increase trailed nationwide trends.  The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/may/04/mike-huckabee/mike-huckabee-says-he-raised-average-family-income/

Historic recall elections in Wisconsin cost ""tens of millions of dollars,"" Scott Walker says
","One of the accomplishments that made Scott Walker a leading Republican presidential contender was becoming the nation's first governor to survive a recall election -- one of three gubernatorial races he won in four years. The 2012 recalls of Walker, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch and three GOP state senators were brought on by Walker's Act 10 -- a 2011 law that sharply curtailed collective bargaining powers for most public employees in Wisconsin. The measure drew massive protests in Madison. While on an April 27, 2015 trip to Massachusetts, Walker touched on those events during in an interview with Howie Carr, a talk show host who is syndicated on more than 20 radio stations in New England. ""They caused damage to the Capitol,"" Walker said of the protesters, ""(and) the recall elections cost tens of millions of dollars to run -- the impact on the taxpayers. It was just -- what we found is the Left never stops."" We rated as Pants on Fire a 2011 claim by Mike Huebsch, then Walker's secretary of administration, that damage by protesters to the Capitol building would cost $7.5 million to repair. The actual estimate was $347,500. So, what about the governor's claim that the recall elections cost tens of millions of dollars to run? It suggests at least a couple of tens of millions -- or $20 million -- was spent. But the actual total falls short of that. In September 2012, there were news reports on an announcement by the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which oversees state elections, that the recalls cost more than $14 million -- $6.3 million for the primaries plus $7.2 million for the recall elections. The largest costs were poll workers salaries and staff wages. They were borne by local taxpayers, since municipalities administer elections. In addition, the Government Accountability Board itself spent $663,000, primarily to process petitions signed by more than 931,000 people in order to get the governor’s recall on the ballot. The state board also had previously announced that a separate round of Senate recall elections, in July and August of 2011, cost state and local taxpayers $2.1 million. So that's a total of nearly $16.3 million, which is sizable, particularly since it hadn't been budgeted. But it's short of tens of millions. Our rating Walker said ""the recall elections"" that aimed to remove him, the lieutenant governor and several state lawmakers from office ""cost tens of millions of dollars to run."" His claim suggests at least $20 million was spent, but the tally was $16.3 million. That's more than a single ten, but less than ""tens of millions."" For a claim that has only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.  To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.",/factchecks/2015/may/04/scott-walker/historic-recall-elections-wisconsin-cost-tens-mill/
"['Agriculture', 'Water', 'Texas', 'Sid Miller']","
Sid Miller says Texas farmers 'just about maxed out' in water conservation
","Sid Miller, the Texas agriculture commissioner, said at a March 2015 symposium that farmers in the state have little room to save more water. Miller, responding to Evan Smith of the Texas Tribune, prefaced his claim by saying Texas is out of ""surplus water."" He went on to say that as much as the state has urbanized, agricultural production has surged — and all that with farmers needing less water. ""So agriculture is at 98, according to the water development board, we’re at 98 percent efficiency,"" meaning 2 percent of water used to raise crops isn’t going to its intended purpose. ""So we’re just about maxed out as to what we can do on the conservation end of it,"" Miller said. Luke Metzger of Environment Texas heard Miller’s statement and asked us to check it out. He noted too that a skeptical crowd member at the event asked Miller to explain. In reply, Miller said a lot of irrigation occurs underground, most runoff water is recaptured and most traditional irrigation methods have ebbed. ""It’s pretty highly sophisticated,"" Miller said. Miller's basis To get our grip on his ""maxed out"" claim, we asked the Texas Department of Agriculture to elaborate. By email, agency spokesman Bryan Black provided a March 11, 2015, presentation by the Texas Water Development Board, whose mission centers on supporting the conservation and responsible development of water for Texas, stating Texas agricultural ""producers now achieve up to 98 percent irrigation efficiency."" Black later quoted a 2012 report from the Texas Water Resources Institute, based at Texas A&M University, stating: ""Irrigation efficiency has gone from 60 percent to 88–95 percent in much of the state today, allowing Texas to get much more value and agricultural output from its water."" Black said that according to the report’s lead author, the institute’s associate director, Kevin Wagner, ""the most up-to-date number on irrigation efficiency is now around 98 percent."" ‘Significant advances’ An institute press release on the report quoted Dana Porter, an AgriLife Extension agricultural engineering expert, saying that in Texas over the past few decades, ""significant advances have been made in irrigation efficiency, as many irrigators now use high-efficiency advanced irrigation technologies, such as low-pressure center pivot sprinkler systems or subsurface drip irrigation. ""However,"" Porter said, ""challenges remain and there are opportunities for continued improvements in water use efficiency through application of situation-appropriate efficient irrigation technologies and best management practices, including irrigation scheduling, and through use of drought-tolerant crop varieties and integrated crop and pest management practices."" According to the report, as of 2008, more than 6 million acres were irrigated in Texas--mostly in West and South Texas--accounting for more than 10 percent of the nation’s irrigated land. Total annual irrigation water use has remained steady, the report said, averaging approximately 9.5 million acre-feet, since the late 1970s. The report presented one path to a ""98 percent"" statement, saying: ""Historically, most agricultural irrigation was applied using flood and furrow irrigation; however, most of the state has undergone a mass conversion from these systems to more efficient irrigation systems"" topped by low-pressure sprinkler systems that apply water at or below a crop’s canopy, it said. Key section: ""As of 2008, center pivot sprinklers are used on nearly 80% of Texas’ irrigated acres, and 87% of those acres are using low-pressure center pivot sprinklers. Furrow and flood irrigation account for less than 20% of irrigated acres today. Further, the highly efficient subsurface drip irrigation, in which there is minimal evaporative loss, is increasingly being adopted and now comprises almost 3% of irrigated acres. ""Because of this adoption, irrigation efficiency has gone from 60% to 88–95% in much of the state today, allowing Texas to get much more value and agricultural output from its water."" An accompanying chart indicates sprinkler and drip irrigation was in place for more than 80 percent of the state’s farmland in 2008 with less conservative furrow and flood irrigation used in 19 percent. Best efficiency, subsurface drip irrigation Next, we reached out to the institute’s Wagner, who said by phone he would have added a phrase to what Miller said by specifying that farmers can achieve up to 98 percent efficiency ""if they use subsurface drip irrigation"" instead of less conservative methods--and drip irrigation was being used by only 3 percent of Texas farmers as of 2008, he added by email. Significantly, Wagner said, it’s harder to adapt subsurface irrigation in parts of the state where water isn’t always immediately available. That’s because drip systems count on a steady supply of water, he said. ""We can never get 100 percent of our acres to subsurface drip without significantly changing our water delivery system,"" Wagner said. Wagner told us 95 percent efficiency can be achieved by using the most efficient center pivot sprinklers ""but again, not all farms have implemented the most efficient systems on the market."" ""Because center pivots have been adopted in much of the state,"" Wagner wrote, ""most irrigation is in the range of 88-95% efficiency. However, we continue to work with producers to improve irrigation efficiency and timing."" Going forward, he said, ""improvements on the vast majority of irrigated acres are going to be much smaller as we now tweak technology and management. So in a sense, ‘the low hanging fruit’ has been picked."" Earlier, we connected with the water development board’s Robert Mace, who also stressed drip irrigation as key to achieving 98 percent efficiency. ""We don’t think farmers are maxed out,"" Mace said. ""Everybody can do a little better with some advice."" ""Individual ag producers are achieving upwards of 98 percent irrigation efficiency,"" Mace said. ""But there is still work to be done."" Our ruling Miller said Texas agriculture is ""at 98 percent efficiency"" in water use and ""just about maxed out as to what we can do on the conservation end of it."" Farmers are not just about maxed out, experts told us, though those who use drip irrigation may be close. Growers using sprinkler methods may get 88 percent to 95 percent efficiency.

"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Military', 'David Perdue']","
Sen. Perdue overstates real reduction in U.S. armed forces
","David Perdue rose on the Senate floor last week to lay out his vision for the country as Georgia’s freshman senator. The former Fortune 500 CEO talked about his fiscal priorities and concerns with the Obama administration’s foreign policy, before tying the two together with an oft-repeated claim. The United States is ""about to have the smallest Army since before WWII, the smallest Navy since WWI and the smallest Air Force ever,"" Perdue said. ""This is simply unacceptable."" Republican leaders have made similar claims as a talking point against President Barack Obama since Mitt Romney’s failed presidential bid in 2012. The Truth-O-Meter has spun wildly on those statements about military size, and the implications that a shrinking military is a threat to national security, based on how they were framed.  (Read more about those rulings here and here .) PolitiFact Georgia decided to see how Perdue would stack up in his statement. We reached out to Perdue’s staff, which cited a 2011 letter from then-Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, warning that including the Pentagon in sequestration cuts would be devastating. ""Rough estimates suggest after 10 years of these cuts,"" Panetta wrote, ""we would have the smallest ground force since 1940, the smallest number of ships since 1915, and the smallest Air Force in its history."" The problem with that sourcing: the cuts have not come to pass. THE ARMY The Defense Department’s 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review shows the Army is on pace to pare down to about 450,000 soldiers by 2019. Under sequestration cuts – which lawmakers have so far kept from hitting the military – the number would drop to 420,000. But today, the Army has about 490,000 soldiers. That is a down from the 570,000 soldiers serving during the height of recent wars - but still not as small 460,000 soldiers serving at the turn of the century, after the end of the Cold War but before the 9/11 terror attacks, said David E. Johnson, a military historian and political scientist at the Rand Corporation. And it’s more than double the 269,000 Army soldiers in 1940, before a draft was enacted. ""By strict numbers, at this moment, it is heading to among the smallest,"" Johnson said. ""One of the smallest, but not at all the smallest."" NAVY The Navy counts about 326,000 active-duty sailors today. But experts measure the Navy and Air Force size in terms of ships and aircraft available for deployment. The quadrennial review estimates a fleet of 234 battle force ships by 2019. In 1915, two years before the U.S. became part of World War I, the Navy had 231 deployable ships. Projected cuts have also not hit the Navy, which has 273 deployable ships today, according to the Department of the Navy website. And our allies and foes alike have kept their word to the 1922 Washington Naval Conference, which limits the world’s navies by tonnage as a solution to an early arms race. In other words, the Navy has been small since WWI not because of any single administration decision but due to a nearly century-old disarmament accord. AIR FORCE The Air Force’s history dates back to 1947, when it became a separate military branch after being part of the Army during World War II. The 2012 fact check on the same claim from Romney found that the branch had about 6,000 aircraft as of 2009. That was the lowest number since 1950, the earliest year available. That means Perdue, is most likely correct on the size of the Air Force, as commonly measured by experts. Moreover, the active duty strength of the Air Force – now at 359,000 – is projected to drop to about 328,000 by 2019, according to Air Force spokesman Lt. Col. Michael Coleman. That would be the lowest active duty strength since the 1947 tally of about 309,000, Coleman said. WHAT IT ALL MEANS So, if Perdue is right on the size of the Air Force but off on the other two branches, what does that mean for his overall point? Perdue used military size as evidence that the national debt is crippling the national security and specifically attacked the Obama administration for cutting military spending. Military history experts, though, warn that the comparisons on size are inaccurate, given advances in warfare technology. Johnson said that only 20 percent of bombs dropped in World War II hit within 1,000 meters of their target. Those planes carried up to 10 people. Today, one pilot and one plane can strike with the same precision. ""The real issue to be addressed is the U.S. ability to project military power abroad to achieve its key national security objectives and how that power compares to others in the present who seek to prevent us from achieving them,"" said William Stueck, a historian at the University of Georgia. Even with recent cuts, the U.S. also still spends as much as the next seven biggest defense-spending countries combined, said Alex Roland, a military history professor at Duke University. While that does not resolve the question of whether current budgets are enough, it helps show that the national interest is clearly focused on spending resources on national security. That’s why sequestration cuts have yet to truly affect the Pentagon, even as resources were shifted to battle a bad economy while also winding down wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Stueck said. Perdue might have been better off leaving the numbers out of his argument then, and instead discussing the need to change priorities now that the economy has stabilized. The size does matter, Johnson said. But mostly as a way to show the presence of the United States globally and what happens if a crisis occurs and the U.S. does not have the presence to act swiftly. ""The real comparison is, we didn’t do anything until 1942 in World War II,"" Johnson. ""His point is better made to ask: In the world we are now, can we wait until there is an attack and then take another year to get anyone anywhere to do something about the problem?"" That’s not what Perdue said. In his first Senate floor speech, he cited a shrinking military that the numbers do not fully bear out. Perdue does have a valid point to make, about a historical success in paying for a military whose strength and size make it more likely to be a deterrent than a singular battle force. But he complicates his point by relying on dated information and the wrong comparisons. His argument can be supported, but not with the numbers he provides. We rate his claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/may/04/david-perdue/sen-perdue-overstates-real-reduction-us-armed-forc/
"['National', 'Campaign Finance', 'Economy', 'John Boehner']","
John Boehner: 'We spend more money on antacids than we do on politics'
","Bellyaching about the state of American politics doesn’t seem to get very far with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. In a freewheeling interview with NBC News, Boehner dismissed the idea that special interests or gerrymandered congressional districts undercut what Washington does for the average citizen. And ditto for the billions of dollars that fuel the American political system.  ""We spend more money on antacids than we do on politics,"" Boehner told Meet the Press host Chuck Todd on May 3, 2015. ""We live in an imperfect democracy. But as bad as it is, let me tell you this. It’s better than any other place in the world."" That struck us as a novel comparison. Do Tums and Rolaids lay a bigger claim to Americans’ paychecks than electioneering? We dug into the numbers, and while we are confident that Boehner could tell us how he spells relief when it comes to taxes, his math leaves something to be desired. Boehner’s spokesman Kevin Smith pointed us to two articles. One from the trade publication Drug Topics spoke of a $10 billion yearly market for antacids. The other from the nonprofit organization that tracks political money, the Center for Responsive Politics, said total spending on federal campaigns in 2014 was $3.7 billion. The problem is, that antacid number was for sales worldwide. In America, the total is about $2 billion. We found that estimate from a couple of sources. The business website Statista.com reported $1.96 billion in sales of antacid tablets in 2013. That excludes liquid antacids. We found 2011 figures for both tablets and liquid antacids. Liquid antacid sales add about 5 percent more to the total -- $1.6 billion in tablets compared to about $83 million for liquids. Assuming the same trend held in 2013, we’re looking at a total sales figure around $2 billion. That’s a lot of indigestion, but it’s less than the amount spent on the 2014 federal elections. The most recent data from the Center for Responsive Politics actually puts the total closer to $3.8 billion. That includes spending by the candidates’ campaigns, the party committees, Super PACs and outside groups. Even if we limit the tally just to candidates and the parties, there was still more than $2.7 billion spent. Boehner’s comparison gets into deeper trouble when state-level races are factored in. The National Institute on Money in State Politics reports almost $3 billion in spending in 2014 to elect governors and members of state legislatures.

No, the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight didn't generate more revenue than the GDP of 29 countries
","The fight of the century this weekend between Floyd ""Money"" Mayweather and Manny Pacquiao was also the payday of the century. But did revenue from the boxing match at the MGM Grand Arena Saturday night surpass the Gross Domestic Products of nearly 30 countries? That was the claim made a couple of times during the HBO/Showtime pay-per-view broadcast. Ticket sales topped $74 million (more than the Super Bowl), organizers said, and another 3 million people were expected to fork over $100 to watch the fight at home. Add in other sources of revenue and Saturday’s event was projected to generate an estimated $400 million. That’s ""larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries,"" HBO boxing sportscaster Jim Lampley said during the live broadcast. We’re not sure where Lampley and event organizers got their information from -- we weren’t able to get in touch with him or someone from HBO -- but that figure is way off, according to the World Bank, which tracks global financial data for about 200 countries and territories. There are only six countries with an annual Gross Domestic Product of less than $400 million, according to the bank’s 2013 ranking. (GDP is the monetary value of all goods and services that an economy produces in a year and a standard measurement of an economy’s size). All six are tiny island nations. Here are their 2013 GDPs: Micronesia: $316 million Sao Tome and Principe: $311 million Palau: $247 million Marshall Islands: $191 million Kiribati: $169 million Tuvalu: $38 million The country with the seventh-lowest GDP is Tonga, with a GDP of $466 million, just surpassing the estimated revenue of the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight. For comparison, the United States had the world’s largest GDP in 2013 -- $16.8 trillion. We think one explanation for the large discrepancy with Lampley’s claim is the fact that the World Bank doesn’t have GDP data for 22 economies. But of the missing 22, most are territories of other nations -- for example the United States territory of Guam or the British territory of the Cayman Islands. Only six without a 2013 World Bank GDP are fully independent nations: Andorra, North Korea, Liechtenstein, Myanmar, Somalia and Syria. We looked up the most recent GDP estimates we could find for each country to see if any were less than $400 million, but we found that all six exceeded that amount: Andorra: $3.7 billion (2008 -- World Bank) North Korea: $28 billion (2009 -- CIA World Factbook) Liechtenstein: $4.8 billion (2009 -- World Bank) Myanmar: $64.3 billion (2014 -- CIA World Factbook) Somalia: $2.4 billion (2010 -- CIA World Factbook) Syria: $40.4 billion (2007 -- World Bank) So in total, only six countries have GDPs smaller than the revenue brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight. Our ruling Lampley said the revenue brought in by the Mayweather-Pacquiao fight was ""larger than the annual GDP of 29 different countries."" The match was estimated to generate about $400 million, which is a lot of money, to be sure. But only six out of the world’s nearly 200 countries have GDPs smaller than that, according to World Bank data. We’re KO’ing this claim. Pants on Fire! Correction: All 50 U.S. states have a gross state product in excess of $400 million.

E-cigarette maker: Study shows electronic cigarettes are less addictive than conventional ones
","Electronic cigarettes are devices designed to mimic cigarettes without burning tobacco. Instead, a liquid is rapidly heated, turning it into a gas that users inhale. Often the liquid contains nicotine, the highly addictive substance that keeps smokers hooked. Many smokers say e-cigs have allowed them to stay away from conventional cigarettes and avoid the cancer-causing chemicals they generate. Whether e-cigs should be regulated and banned from public areas the way most tobacco products are, has become contentious here and across the country. The health risks posed to users of e-cigarettes and the people nearby remain uncertain. Some products give off visible smoke, while others don't. Some of the liquids vaporized by the devices contain pleasant flavors, sparking fear that non-cigarette smokers -- particularly teens -- will embrace them and become addicted to nicotine. Complicating the debate: some liquids don't contain any nicotine at all, which avoids the health risk that nicotine is known to pose. Against this backdrop, the Rhode Island Senate Committee on Health & Human Services held a hearing April 16, 2015, on two proposals. The first, S-482, would require vendors to post the same warning signs that go with conventional tobacco products when they sell e-cigarettes. The second, S-489, ""prohibits the use of electronic nicotine delivery system products in public places and places of employment,"" just as smoking is prohibited. One person to testify against both bills was Dino Baccari, whose North Providence company, White Horse Vapor, makes and sells e-cigarettes. Baccari contended that even though conventional cigarettes and most e-cigs contain nicotine, ""vaping"" on an e-cigarette is not as addictive. He said he had the evidence to prove it. ""Penn State University, Dec. 17 of 2014, found that electronic cigarettes … are far less addictive than cigarettes,"" he told the committee. Because nicotine is the driving force in tobacco addiction, and nicotine content in vaping products varies widely, we wondered if Baccari's assessment of the research was correct. He sent us a link to the Penn State website where a Dec. 9, 2014, news release declared: ""E-cigarettes less addictive than cigarettes."" The chief author of the study, published in the respected journal Nicotine & Tobacco Research, was Jonathan Foulds, professor of public health sciences and psychiatry at Penn State's College of Medicine. He told us that former smokers who now use electronic cigarettes indicated that e-cigarettes were far less addicting. The conclusion was based on an online survey with 158 questions, some of which were designed to assess things such as withdrawal, craving and frequency of use. Just over 3,600 e-cigarette users responded. Here are some of the findings in which the e-cigs users were asked comparable questions about their smoking and vaping: * While 86 percent reported ""strong,"" ""very strong"" or ""extremely strong"" urges to smoke a cigarette, the rate was just 12 percent with e-cigarettes. * While 41 percent said their cravings were so strong they had woken up at night to smoke cigarettes, only 7 percent of e-cigarette users said they had done that. * While 92 percent said they were more irritable when they were unable to smoke their cigarettes, only 26 percent reported that type of irritability when they can't use their e-cigarette. * ""Over 90 percent reported that they had experienced strong urges to smoke and withdrawal symptoms when a smoker, but only 25 to 35 percent reported experiencing these symptoms of dependence as an e-cig user."" Foulds said it's likely that e-cigarettes are less addictive because they are not as efficient at getting nicotine into the body as cigarettes. ""They deliver less nicotine and less quickly,"" Foulds said. The highest dependence levels were seen among e-cigarette users whose liquids contained the highest levels of nicotine and among users of newer e-cigarette products that deliver more nicotine to the body faster. But even those customers reported that they felt less addicted than when they smoked tobacco. Such research is not without its potential problems, as Foulds acknowledged. People may not accurately recall their cravings from their days as cigarette smokers. Also, it was an online survey that anyone could take, although the team tried to flag people who might have a financial interest in promoting e-cigarettes. ""Maybe in five years, these people will be just as addicted to their e-cigarettes,"" Foulds said. ""But based on the data that we have in this study, we got a significantly lower dependence score"" than for conventional cigarettes. A spokeswoman for the American Lung Association said the study appears to be ""legitimate, thorough and balanced."" We also found a second study, published Feb. 1, 2015, in the journal Drug and Alcohol Dependence, led by Jean-Francois Etter of the University of Geneva, which reached a similar conclusion based on survey data. Said the authors, ""We found that e-cigarettes users were less addicted to e-cigarettes than smokers were addicted to tobacco cigarettes."" A third survey-based study from 2013, published in the journal Drug and Alcohol Review, found the same thing. Our ruling Dino Baccari said that a Penn State University study found that ""electronic cigarettes … are far less addictive than cigarettes."" He's not blowin' smoke. His characterization of the study's conclusion is accurate. But it's important to note that the conclusion is based on an open-to-anyone survey that relied on the recall of e-cigarette users who may have a natural bias toward reporting that the products they've chosen to use are less addicting than the cigarettes they're trying to avoid. Comparable studies support that conclusion. With the limitations in the methodology, we would characterize the statement as accurate, but in need of clarification or additional information, which we classify as Mostly True.

The family’s banking business has had an office in Russia since the 1990s — though it recently suspended operations — but it has no oversight over the country’s currency or monetary policies, which are controlled by the Bank of Russia. The Rothschild family has long been the target of conspiracy theories, and their wealth is believed to have inspired the anti-Semitic trope that Jewish people ""control"" the world’s money. The entity now known as the Bank of Russia was founded in 1860, and in 1917, ""after a decree was adopted … about the nationalization of banks, a state monopoly on banking was announced,"" according to the bank's website. The bank is the sole issuer of currency in Russia and sets the country’s monetary policies. Beginning in the 1800s, the Rothschild family operated banks in five European cities. But the family no longer has the same kind of global power it did in the 18th and 19th centuries, PolitiFact reported in 2019. ""With no monolithic house, the Rothschild name has connections to a number of independent business ventures (that) have investments in mining, energy, farming, real estate and winemaking,"" according to PolitiFact.

But the company has now suspended its activities in the country, Bloomberg reported in March. A Facebook post says Putin ""ended the Rothschild's control over Russia by nationalizing the Russian centralized bank."" Putin did not nationalize the Russian centralized bank; that occurred in 1917.

Biden’s American Rescue Plan fueled inflation. So did post-COVID shortages
","Jane Timken, a candidate in Ohio’s Republican U.S. Senate primary, casts herself as a ""mom on a mission."" She seeks to blend a pro-Trump agenda with a focus on kitchen table issues. In a recent ad, she targeted inflation and President Joe Biden’s policies. ""Joe Biden's wasteful spending has sent prices skyrocketing,"" Timken said in the April 13 ad. ""Now, everything from groceries to gas and meals with our families costs more."" The ad shows a headline from an article in the conservative National Review ""Inflation soars to four-decade high."" We decided to look at how much of an impact Biden’s spending had on prices. We reached out to Timken’s office and did not hear back, but this criticism of Biden generally refers to passage of the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan.  The March 2021 Democratic bill included $1,400 payments to about 85% of Americans, $360 billion for state and local governments, and $242 billion in expanded unemployment benefits, among other things. As lawmakers worked on the measure, some economists, including Larry Summers, a top official under President Barack Obama, warned that the bill would lead to inflation. Fiscal conservatives joined in the warning. ""The American Rescue Plan was far larger than the economy could support,"" said Marc Goldwein with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a group that promotes lower deficits.  In the months that followed, inflation has taken off in the U.S. In March, prices were 8.5% higher than 12 months earlier. Even filtering out the cost of food and energy, which can rise and fall quickly, inflation still ran at a yearly rate of 6.4%. How much of this can be put at Biden’s feet? Some, but not all of it, experts say. ""With no American Rescue Plan, we would still have inflation above the Federal Reserve’s target of 2% to 3%,"" Goldwein said. The post-COVID-19 inflation story is more complicated than just federal spending. Other forces, including changes in the labor market, rising global energy and commodity prices, supply chain dysfunction and the war in Ukraine have all contributed to higher prices. No magic formula can reveal precisely how much the American Rescue Plan fueled inflation, but the general consensus is that it was a contributor. Some economists estimate that it added two percentage points to the rate, some say it added up to four percentage points. Put another way, out of the 8.5% rate in March, the measure accounted for something between one quarter to one half of inflation. Economist Dean Baker, with the left-leaning Center for Economic and Policy Research, puts the number at about two percentage points. ""My main basis for saying this is that other wealthy countries, without remotely comparable stimulus packages, have seen comparable jumps in their inflation rates,"" Baker said. Baker looked at Europe to help tease out the global inflation drivers from the American ones.  Douglas Holtz-Eakin, president of the conservative-leaning American Action Forum, also compared the U.S. with Europe. Between the first and last quarters of 2021, European inflation went up three points. In the same period, U.S. inflation rose more than four points. Several inflationary forces affected nearly every nation. COVID cut into the supply of workers and goods. Businesses struggled to find employees. Manufacturers couldn’t get the parts they needed — the shortage of microchips was a prominent example. Both dynamics pushed prices higher. The resurging economy outstripped the supply of oil and natural gas, leading to higher energy costs. As the pandemic eased, the economic recovery also triggered shortfalls in the supply of grains and other farm products. ""Europe had to deal with the supply-side, the broken supply-chains and the rest,"" Holtz-Eakin said. ""They did not do stimulus to the extent we did, and they still got inflation."" Holtz-Eakin pointed to the moment when the U.S. and Europe parted ways — in the second quarter of 2021. That was right after passage of the American Rescue Plan. About half of the U.S. increase of four percentage points ""you can easily attribute to the stimulus,"" Holtz Eakin  said. Other economists estimate higher impacts. Michael Strain with the free-market-oriented American Enterprise Institute put the figure at about three points for 2021. Harvard economist and former Obama administration official Jason Furman said it could be as high as four points in 2022. Going forward, it’s likely to get harder to tease out the inflationary impact of the American Rescue Plan. Russia’s attack on Ukraine disrupted a world economy that was still sorting itself out after COVID. Sanctions aimed at cutting Russia’s energy revenues sent oil and gas prices soaring. The war’s crippling hit on Ukraine’s agricultural sector, combined with sanctions (Russia is a major wheat producer), has raised the prices of basic goods like wheat and sunflower oil. Baker says that in ordinary times, with the bulk of the stimulus already spent, the economy would be on its way toward balance. ""However, the special factors of the pandemic and war prevent that,"" Baker said. ""And of course, oil is a big part of the problem."" Another complicating factor is the effect of the spending that came before Biden took office. Two bipartisan COVID-relief packages cost over $3 trillion. Goldwein said it all contributed to inflation, though he thinks the American Rescue Plan added more, because it came as the economy was already springing back. Holtz-Eakin also said that the earlier spending was more in line with the level of economic damage due to the pandemic. There is concern that companies are profiting from inflation, and fueling it further. Baker said corporate profits are high, but  he’s neither surprised by the trend, nor does he see anything conspiratorial at hand. ""The way you ration demand is with higher prices,"" Baker said. ""This might be a good argument for higher corporate taxes, since they have been the big winners, and there clearly are competitiveness problems in many industries, but I don't think that is the story of the current inflation."" Timken said Biden's spending ""has sent prices skyrocketing."" The 2021 American Rescue Plan Act added about $1.9 trillion to the economy, and economists across the political spectrum say that it spurred inflation. They differ on the precise scale of its impact, with estimates ranging from two to four additional points out of the current inflation rate of about 8.5%. However, none of the experts we reached, liberal and conservative, said Biden’s actions were responsible for all of the inflation. Past government spending, COVID’s disruptions to labor markets, energy prices and supply-chains also played significant roles. Most recently, the war in Ukraine has made a challenging situation worse. We rate this claim Half True.

Fact-checking Warnock’s statement that a drop in oil prices doesn’t cause major drop in gas prices
","When it comes to gas prices at the pump, what goes up doesn’t necessarily come back down – at least not as fast as people think it should. Sen. Raphael Warnock, D-Ga., made this argument in an April 5 letter to President Joe Biden. ""While the initial increase in oil prices resulted in a near instantaneous increase in gas prices for consumers, the subsequent decrease in crude oil prices has failed to meaningfully provide relief for Georgia's families at the pump,"" Warnock said. Warnock, who is in a tough reelection fight in one of the nation’s top battleground states, pointed to data from AAA showing how gas prices remained high in Georgia in March even as oil prices had already peaked. The price at the pump — how to bring it down and who and what is to blame for the spike — is a central theme of 2022 midterm election messaging. In November, Warnock will face the winner of the May 24 Republican primary in which former football player Herschel Walker is the frontrunner. We took a closer look at Warnock’s assertion that crude oil prices have fallen without triggering a notable decline in gasoline prices. We found that he has a point but omits one key piece of information. Even though prices do indeed rise faster in response to increased crude prices than they fall in response to decreased crude prices, they also do eventually go back down to levels more on par with the price of crude oil. During the early months of the pandemic, gasoline prices cratered as more people stayed home. When travel and commutes resumed, pushing demand, the price at the pump began to rise.  Then, in February, some countries imposed sanctions on Russian oil over the country’s invasion of Ukraine, throwing the global oil market into disarray again. With reduced supply, prices went up. In fact, gasoline prices during the first week of March 2022 were more than 50% higher than they were the first week of March 2021. Warnock pointed to AAA figures showing that the average price for a gallon of gas in Georgia in late February was $3.40, a figure that rose by late March to $3.95. Meanwhile, Warnock also referred to figures from the U.S. Energy Administration that showed that prior to Russia’s invasion in late February, crude oil was about $92 a barrel, rising above $123 a barrel on March 8, and then falling to below $100 by April 1. ""Despite a noted decrease in the price for a barrel of oil from its previous peak, the current average price for a gallon of gas in Georgia is $3.86, a reduction of only $0.09 per gallon in a week,"" Warnock wrote on April 5 to Biden. It’s important to note that Georgia’s gas prices dropped after Gov. Brian Kemp in mid March signed a 29 cent state gas tax holiday through May 31. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, said much of the drop in gas prices in Georgia was due to the tax holiday, but a small amount was because the price of oil was falling. Warnock’s office pointed PolitiFact to April 5 testimony by Robert McCullough, an energy consultant to a U.S. Senate committee, on a theory about oil and gas prices called ""rockets and feathers."" ""One continuing mystery concerns the inconsistent response of gasoline markets to changes in the price of feedstocks,"" McCullough testified. ""For example, the phrase ‘up like a rocket, down like a feather’ has often been used to describe the rapid increase in retail gasoline prices when oil prices rise, but the very slow decrease in gasoline prices when oil prices fall. The rocket/feather effect occurred recently when the price of oil increased markedly in the first week of March and then fell even more dramatically in the second week of March."" Warnock’s office also pointed to an explanation of the ""rockets and feathers"" phenomenon by the Washington Post. Severin Borenstein, a Berkeley professor and expert on the oil and gas industry, echoed this point: ""Gasoline prices do eventually go back to the level one would expect given the price of crude oil."" One reason for the rocket/feather dynamic, experts say, is that consumers become ultra-sensitive when gas prices rise, often searching around for the best price before buying, creating a more competitive environment for gas stations, Lewis said. When oil and gas prices are rising, the stations don’t earn enough money to cover their rent, labor and other expenses.  ""Therefore, gasoline prices only increase once they are forced to by rapidly rising oil prices, at which point they increase rather quickly,"" Lewis said. ""Once oil and gas prices start falling, consumers will encounter prices that are lower than what they have recently observed. They tend to interpret this as a sign that they have found a relatively low-priced station, so they stop searching and purchase."" The lack of aggressive price searching by consumers during periods when gasoline prices are falling makes station competition less intense and allows stations to charge margins large enough to start covering their other expenses again, Lewis said.   Gas stations tend to raise their prices about two to four days after a surge in costs, said De Haan, the GasBuddy analyst. As oil costs were rising in February and March, gas stations were losing money, De Haan said. ""They lost an incredible amount of money on the way up when oil prices were surging and at the stations,"" he said. They were ""at best selling at or below their cost."" The volatility of oil prices gives gas stations anxiety about cutting prices. ""They don’t want to stick their neck out too far and lower prices too quickly, because they might shoot back up and then the station is losing money again,"" De Haan said. ""That's the important context here to what the senator said."" One way to measure that volatility is to look at the number of days in which the difference between the low and high cost moved more than $8 a barrel in a single day. That happened once in 2021. So far in 2022, it has happened 16 times.  Warnock said that ""while the initial increase in oil prices resulted in a near instantaneous increase in gas prices for consumers, the subsequent decrease in crude oil prices has failed to meaningfully provide relief for Georgia's families at the pump."" Typically, when oil prices rise, gas stations raise their prices within a few days. But the drop in crude oil prices generally doesn’t lead to an instant drop at the gas pump. Experts say this ""rockets and feathers"" dynamic — a fast rise followed by a slow decline — is common over the short term, but over the longer term, crude oil prices and prices at the pump generally move in unison.  We rate this statement Mostly True.  RELATED: All of our fact-checks about gas prices  RELATED: The race for the Georgia U.S. Senate seat: A guide  ",/factchecks/2022/apr/20/raphael-warnock/fact-checking-warnocks-statement-drop-oil-prices-d/

Google Maps did not change blurring settings to reveal secret Russian military facilities
","Pigeons, airplanes, satellites and drones have long been used to produce aerial photos that guide military action on the ground. But in recent years, these images have moved beyond military circles. They are sometimes also being shared on social media to push false information and influence public perception of wars.  Before Russia invaded Ukraine in February, satellite images were used to track the massing of Russian troops around Ukraine. Then they were used to reveal the movement of Russian tanks towards Kyiv, to expose the destruction caused by the war across Ukraine, and to document the atrocities committed by Russian forces in Bucha. Some satellite images have been shared with false information. That was the case with a Facebook post published on April 18 that claimed that Google Maps started publishing images of secret Russian facilities in unprecedented high resolutions.

""Below is the fake news photo on the left and the real Presidential seal from Google on the right.  Did the eagle dye his tail feathers white for Easter? Why is eagle smoking a cigarette?"" The supposed fake seal, the one visible in a photo @POTUS tweeted that shows the Bidens flanked by people in bunny costumes, shows a bald eagle with a white tail. According to social media posts, the authentic seal features a brown tail.  In both images, it could look as if the eagle is puffing on a pipe but what’s actually pictured is the bird holding the end of a banner in its beak that reads ""E Pluribus Unum"" — ""out of many, one.""  The presidential seal as it exists today dates back to 1945, when Harry S. Truman was president.  A website for Truman’s Little White House — his winter retreat in Florida — does show an eagle with brown tail feathers on a page about the presidential seal and flag.  But we found that brown-tailed eagle on a presidential seal in a few other credible places. That’s because the seal the Bidens stood in front of — at the White House on April 18 — is authentic.  You can even see the same seal in footage of then-President Donald Trump and his family celebrating Easter at the White House in 2017.  It appears in a 2013 Smithsonian Magazine story about the seal and is described as ""the modern seal of the President of the United States."" It’s also in a White House Historical Association’s post about the history of the presidential seal. And you’ll even find it on a Britannica page for kids about the U.S. presidential seal.

Australia health agency didn’t say vaccines could be given to sedated people without their consent

While the health agency did advise COVID-19 vaccination for people under sedation, it isn’t being used as a measure to enforce compliance with vaccination requirements — patient consent is required.  PolitiFact reached out to the agency but did not hear back. On April 6, the ATAGI released a report supporting the use of sedation for COVID-19 vaccination for people who have behavior disorders, severe anxiety and needle phobias.  ""The process of administering a vaccine (i.e. giving an intramuscular injection) may cause severe anxiety in some individuals with anxiety disorders or needle-phobia, and/or may be difficult in certain individuals with behavioural disorders,"" the agency said. The group said that the effort cannot be used as a way to force people to get the vaccine and that consent is required beforehand. Here’s what it wrote, with emphasis added by PolitiFact: ""In patients where non-pharmacological techniques have failed, sedation may facilitate safe administration of vaccines in some special circumstances. Informed consent must be obtained prior to each dose from the patient themselves, or, where the patient does not have capacity to give consent, from the parent, guardian or substitute decision-maker. Sedation should not be used as a measure to enforce compliance with vaccination requirements."" A post on Instagram claims that Australia’s immunization advisory group recommends that people be given the COVID-19 vaccine without their consent when they are under sedation.  This is wrong.

Stew Peters film ‘Watch the Water’ ridiculously claims COVID-19 is snake venom. That’s Pants on Fire
","A new anti-vaccine documentary ridiculously claims that the coronavirus is not a virus, but a synthetic version of snake venom that evil forces are spreading through remdesivir, the mRNA COVID-19 vaccines and drinking water to ""make you a hybrid of Satan.""  The 48-minute film, released April 11, is the latest in an expanding genre of mega-viral, conspiracy-laden videos made in the mold of the ""Plandemic"" video from May 2020. Its title, ""Watch the Water,"" is a nod to a favorite refrain of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which is centered around the belief that a secret cabal of Satan-worshipping pedophiles is running a global sex-trafficking ring. The video is an interview between far-right radio host Stew Peters, who has a history of using inflammatory rhetoric and spreading COVID-19 conspiracy theories, and Bryan Ardis, a former chiropractor who built a brand around claiming that the drug remdesivir is killing people.  It showed Ardis, who sells acne products and is now using the film to sell what he calls ""anti-v"" supplement kits online, invoking the Garden of Eden story and a fictional TV show plot as he outlined an elaborate mass-murder scheme that he claimed involves even the pope. ""I think the plan all along was to get the serpent's, the evil one's DNA into your God-created DNA,"" Ardis said. ""They're using mRNA, which is mRNA extracted from, I believe, the king cobra venom, the king cobra venom. And I think they want to get that venom inside of you and make you a hybrid of Satan."" The video’s theory is ""miles from reality, and indicates a profound lack of understanding in science and medicine, and much twisted logic,"" said Dr. David Relman, professor of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University. ""There is no evidence whatsoever that SARS-CoV-2 or COVID-19 is caused by snakes or snake venom.""  Some members of the anti-vaccine and QAnon movements met Ardis’ venom claims with skepticism. But Peters promoted the film widely on the messaging app Telegram, and it racked up nearly 3 million views on Rumble, a video hosting platform, in the week after its release. Social media users shared it across other mainstream platforms, where it was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Early in the documentary, Ardis told Peters he first started investigating a potential link between COVID-19 and snake venom after he received a cryptic text from an unnamed doctor asking, ""If you got bit by a rattlesnake, would you go to a hospital and get antivenom?"" The text, Ardis claimed, came in shortly after he had done an interview about the monoclonal antibodies used to treat COVID-19 infections, so that got him thinking. He falsely claimed that the monoclonal antibodies are identical to the anti-venoms used to disable the toxins from a snake bite. He then claimed without evidence that if a public health agency advises against a treatment, then that means the treatment actually works.  A monoclonal antibody treatments center is seen closed on Jan. 25, 2022, in Pembroke Pines, Fla. (AP) The Food and Drug Administration in January recommended limiting the use of monoclonal antibodies as COVID-19 treatments after they were shown to be less effective against the newer variants. So Ardis reasoned that if the FDA was discouraging the use of monoclonal antibodies, and if monoclonal antibodies were anti-venoms, then the coronavirus must actually be venom. ""I realized all of a sudden that monoclonal antibodies are anti-venom,"" Ardis said. ""The federal government doesn’t want us using anti-venom. Why are they bashing anti-venom, and why are we finding anti-venom works against COVID? Is it not a virus? Is it a venom?"" The answer, experts said, is no.  The monoclonal antibodies used for COVID-19 infections ""do not recognize or bind to snake venom,"" Relman said. ""They have nothing whatsoever to do with snake venom."" Anti-venoms are developed by injecting venom into an animal with a robust immune system, such as a horse, and harvesting the antibodies the animal produces in response. Monoclonal antibodies are different. They are lab-produced, or cloned, and designed to boost protection against a specific target like the coronavirus. No monoclonal antibodies have been created yet to target snake venoms, said Dr. Robert Garry, a virologist at Tulane University.  The coronavirus has been isolated, replicated, sequenced, imaged and studied as it has worked its way across the globe, killing over 6 million people. Scientists have no doubt that it’s a virus. But Ardis suggested, for example, that a University of Pittsburgh researcher who was shot dead in May 2020 was killed because he was going to reveal that COVID-19 was snake venom.  The university told PolitiFact that those allegations are ""incorrect and not scientifically valid."" Police said the incident was unrelated to the researcher’s work. Ardis also cited several studies. He pointed to one early-pandemic study that considered snakes as a COVID-19 reservoir, but Garry said its findings were ""very speculative"" and ""pretty quickly rejected.""  Ardis misrepresented a second study, falsely claiming that it showed an enzyme from rattlesnake venom in the blood of COVID-19 patients. In reality, the study found that an enzyme healthy humans already have in their bodies — which is similar but not identical to an enzyme in rattlesnake venom — was circulating at elevated levels in patients who died of COVID-19. Ardis then described a third study in a way that was ""not only disturbing and outrageous but is absolutely incorrect,"" said Gus Wright of Texas A&M University, one of the study’s co-authors.  The study mapped the genetic makeup of the Indian cobra and, to help develop a more effective anti-venom, identified 19 venom toxins that are specific to that snake.  Ardis implied that the 19 toxins were related to COVID-19, but Wright said the study ""in no way has any association with COVID-19."" The 19 in COVID-19 reflects the year it was discovered, 2019.  ""He seems to grab at phrases and fragments of findings and then weave them into a distorted picture,"" Relman said. Toward the end of the film, Ardis went so far as to claim that the phrase ""coronavirus pandemic"" can translate in Latin to ""the pope’s venom pandemic"" or ""king cobra venom pandemic.""  Those interpretations are ""completely false,"" said Massimo Cè, a lexicographer at the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae, the world’s largest dictionary of Latin. Coronaviruses have been known to scientists by that name for decades, Cè said, and the term itself traces back centuries to the Latin word used to describe the halo of light seen around the sun and the moon.  Pope Francis speaks with youth in St. Peter's square at the Vatican on April 18, 2022. (AP) Ardis claimed that evil forces are targeting people with the snake venom through remdesivir, vaccines and drinking water, since venom is a secretion that can’t spread as a respiratory virus. His supposed proof included the observation that both remdesivir and snake venom have ""a white-to-yellowish tint"" when stored, he said. He also referenced debunked videos in which social media users claimed the vaccines made them magnetic, and that tap water tests positive for COVID-19. And he showed a clip from a fictional TV show in which a character was poisoned through his drink. Ardis said after he watched the episode, ""I realized how they’ve been spreading this."" But Gilead, the manufacturer of remdesivir, said Ardis’ claims about the drug containing snake venom and causing mass deaths were ""entirely false.""  Remdesivir is ""definitely not venom from a snake,"" said Dr. Katherine Seley-Radtke, a professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.  The drug’s structure has been repeatedly confirmed as what scientists classify as a ""nucleoside analogue,"" Seley-Radtke said, while snake venom is ""a complex mixture of all sorts of things."" Pfizer also told PolitiFact that its mRNA vaccine is ""entirely synthetic and does not contain any animal products."" Ingredient lists for COVID-19 vaccines are public. The U.S Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the coronavirus has not been detected in drinking water, either. The creator of the fictional TV show that Ardis cited told FactCheck.org that the poisoning scene, which aired in 2017, was not meant to foreshadow the pandemic or the nefarious plot Ardis described.  Water pours out of the faucet on Feb. 20, 2021, in Dallas. (AP) ""This would require a massive conspiracy of scientists, public health officials, etc., in countries all over the world,"" Garry said. ""The claims are wildly inaccurate."" Ardis said COVID-19 is a synthetic version of ""snake venom"" that evil forces are spreading through remdesivir, drinking water and the COVID-19 vaccines to ""make you a hybrid of Satan.""  That’s a far cry from reality, experts said. COVID-19 is not snake venom.  The former chiropractor relied on a mix of misrepresented scientific studies, twisted logic, fictional TV show plotlines, botched Latin, debunked home videos, circumstantial evidence and what he claimed were signs from God to stake his case.

Yes, gas tax hike plan would have added at least a dime per gallon at the pump
","Gas prices may be falling a bit, but the rhetoric around them keeps rising. The latest example came April 7, 2022 in an attack on Gov. Tony Evers on Twitter from state Rep. Tony Kurtz, R-Wonewoc, which is in Juneau County: ""Everyone is feeling pain at the pump. It started well over a year ago. Diesel fuel in Sept 2020 was $2.09, six months later in March 2021 $2.99. If @GovEvers had passed his tax increases, these fuel prices would be at least a dime higher."" In an April 1, 2022 fact-check, we rated a claim in a TV ad that Evers ""tried to make us pay even more at the pump"" Half True, in large part because the claim focused on his intent and a related move at the time would have cushioned the blow.  But this one is framed differently, and looked at in context, it focuses more narrowly on the proposed gas tax increase and its would-be impact on prices today. Is Kurtz right that if Evers ""had passed his (gas) tax increases ... fuel prices would be at least a dime higher?""  When asked to provide backup for the claim, Kurtz’s staff referred PolitiFact Wisconsin to a March 31, 2022, memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau titled ""Estimate of Proposed Motor Fuel Tax Revenues.""  The memo looked at a proposal from Evers in his 2019-21 budget that would have increased the motor vehicle fuel tax by eight cents per gallon – and then tied future increases to inflation, which is known as indexing. The measure failed in the Republican-controlled Legislature, but the analysis estimated the change would have brought in $725 million for transportation funding, if it had been in effect. For our purposes here, we are most interested in where the gas tax would be today. According to the fiscal bureau, once indexing was factored in, as of April 1, 2022 the state gas tax would have been 42 cents per gallon, or 11.1 cents higher than where it is today, without the increase (30.9 cents per gallon). That said, in the tweet, Kurtz only provided part of the picture. The plan from Evers also included a proposal to eliminate the state’s longstanding minimum markup law for gasoline. The minimum markup law was created during the Great Depression to protect small business from larger rivals. The law mandates a price floor where goods like gas, groceries, and beer are ""marked up"" so they are not used as ""loss leaders"" at a price level where the other businesses can’t compete.  The idea from Evers was to offset the pain at the pump for drivers. But a fiscal bureau report at the time noted there are many factors at play in pricing, and there is no guarantee that any savings from removing minimum markup would stay in place.  That means, once you set aside the intent of the Evers plan, and focus more narrowly on the numbers, it yields a different result. Kurtz said if Evers ""had passed his (gas) tax increases ... fuel prices would be at least a dime higher."" By the numbers, a new analysis from the fiscal bureau shows prices would be 11.1 cents higher. That said, Kurtz skips over the fact the pocketbook may have been smaller, given the accompanying plan to eliminate the minimum markup law for gasoline.  For a statement that is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, our rating is Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2022/apr/19/tony-kurtz/yes-gas-tax-hike-plan-would-have-added-least-dime-/

Dr. Oz misses the facts in calling GOP Senate rival McCormick liberal and supportive of Biden, China
","Dr. Mehmet Oz wants voters to know that he is the genuine conservative in the race for Pennsylvania’s U.S. Senate. In a recent TV ad, Oz touted his endorsement from former President Donald Trump as proof of his GOP credentials and then attacked his rival, Dave McCormick, as being on the opposite end of the political scale. Trump endorsed Oz, says the narrator in the 30-second spot, ""because Trump knows who the real conservative is who’s going to shake up Washington. It’s not David McCormick, the liberal, pro-Biden, pro-China Wall Street insider.""   Leaving aside questions about Oz’s own credentials as a conservative, the physician and TV personality misfired in his attempt to brand the former hedge fund CEO as liberal and pro-Biden. McCormick’s history with China is more nuanced, but his campaign rhetoric is not friendly to China. McCormick is not running as a liberal and has worked for a Republican president. McCormick served in senior posts in the Bush administration at the Commerce Department, the Treasury Department and the White House. He is married to Dina Powell, who was Trump’s deputy national security adviser. McCormick’s core policies include encouraging coal mining and natural gas; toughening immigration enforcement, including building Trump’s border wall; opposing vaccine mandates; and enacting voter ID requirements.  McCormick has a roster of conservative key backers. They include Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, former Trump Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the former Trump White House press secretary and current GOP candidate for Arkansas governor. McCormick’s campaign has hired former Trump White House aides Stephen Miller and Hope Hicks. McCormick on his campaign website blasts Biden for the highest inflation in 40 years, for ""open border policies"" and ""foreign policy blunders,"" including the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan. On COVID-19 mandates, McCormick says that unlike Biden, he ""trusts the American people and stands for personal freedom."" On the campaign trail, McCormick claimed, in reference to the Afghanistan withdrawal, that ""the Biden administration’s bureaucracy and incompetence led to one of the most calamitous blunders on the world stage in history."" In a broader attack, McCormick praised Trump and claimed that Biden ""managed to squander"" low gas prices, an economic recovery and more ""inherited"" from Trump. McCormick also criticized Biden after he delivered his State of the Union address in March.  On April 15, McCormick told Fox Business that Biden has a ""socialist agenda"" and a ""war on energy.""   Oz’s campaign did not reply to our requests for information to back the ad’s claim that McCormick is ""pro-China."" But a January Oz ad attacking McCormick on China cited a November Wall Street Journal report that said Bridgewater Associates, where McCormick was CEO, had ""raised the equivalent of $1.25 billion for its third investment fund in China."" The New York Times reported in January that when McCormick announced he would step down as CEO to run for the Senate, his company’s fund managed roughly $1.5 billion on behalf of Chinese investors. In a review of his speeches, comments and essays, as both a public official and private citizen, the Philadelphia Inquirer reported that McCormick in the late 2000s praised China’s economic growth and touted the benefits of U.S. access to a vast, rising market. For example, in a speech at Peking University in Beijing in 2007, McCormick spoke about ""the huge interest each of our countries has in the continued growth and prosperity of the other. When China succeeds, the United States succeeds."" But McCormick has also raised concerns about the nation’s influence, writing in 2006 that ""China’s emergence as a major economic power is one of the most significant developments of the 21st century, requiring a thorough review of U.S. policy."" He called for ""targeted controls"" on U.S. exports to China to prevent helping China expand its military in ways that threaten U.S. interests. And as far as McCormick’s campaign rhetoric goes, it has not been ""pro-China."" In January, on the day he entered the Senate race, McCormick wrote an opinion column saying ""it is past time for America’s leaders to confront head-on the Chinese Communist Party (CCP), which poses the greatest economic and national security threat to the United States….I will do everything in my power to end our dependence on China, protect our communities and our jobs, counter their attempts to reshape the world in their authoritarian image, and ensure America remains the world’s unrivaled military and economic superpower."" On his campaign website, McCormick advocates for ""moving critical supply chains out of China and bringing manufacturing jobs back home; protecting American jobs and intellectual property; sanctioning China for its crimes, including trafficking fentanyl into the U.S""; and ""seeking reparations"" for COVID-19. McCormick’s campaign also referred us to another website paid for by the campaign that refutes what it calls lies about McCormick and China.  One section says that during the 2008 financial crisis, McCormick said that because both the U.S. and Chinese economies had major financial interests in avoiding a global economic collapse, China was behaving like ""a responsible participant and ally"" in dealing with the financial crisis. But McCormick did not say China was an ally of the United States generally in other broader matters. McCormick also ran a campaign ad falsely claiming that China created COVID-19. ""It's time to make them pay for it,"" his ad said.  The Pennsylvania race is for the seat held by Republican Pat Toomey, who was first elected in 2010 and decided not to seek re-election.  Besides McCormick and Oz, the major Republican candidates are commentator Kathy Barnette, real estate developer Jeff Bartos, Philadelphia attorney George Bochetto and Carla Sands, who served as Trump's ambassador to Denmark.  The Real Clear Politics polling average shows McCormick in the lead by 4.2 percentage points over Oz.  The leading Democratic candidates are Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, state Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta and U.S. Rep.  Conor Lamb. The primaries are May 17. Overall, the Nov. 8 general election race is rated as a toss-up and as ""tilts Republican."" The outcome could help determine which party controls the Senate, now split 50-50. Oz said in an ad that McCormick is ""liberal, pro-Biden, pro-China."" McCormick touts a conservative agenda and has been harshly critical of Biden. McCormick has had some more conciliatory things to say about China in the past, but even that was tempered with comments of concern. He is campaigning on standing up to China, including launching his race with a promise to end U.S. dependence on China. We rate this claim False.

Wittman skips key information about smartphones being given to immigrants
","U.S. Rep. Rob Wittman recently mischaracterized a government tool being used to track people entering the country illegally as a smartphone giveaway. ""They’re going to be giving these people who come across the border, giving them smartphones,"" Wittman, R-Va., said during an April 8 radio interview on WRVA. ""Listen, I know a lot of people across our district who would like a smartphone."" Wittman represents Virginia's 1st Congressional District which, in this fall’s election, will extend from Williamsburg and Puquoson north through Westmoreland County. The district will include western Chesterfield County and eastern Hanover County. Although many of Wittman’s constituents may want a smartphone, they’d probably be disappointed with the ones being distributed to undocumented immigrants. Wittman, along with a number of other conservatives, don’t provide context about their purpose and limited capabilities. Immigration officials issue the phones so they can monitor immigrants released from custody; the phones cannot be used for other purposes, like going on Facebook or calling friends. A spokesperson for the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement told PolitiFact National that the agency gives smartphones to some immigrants who have been detained after entering the country illegally.  The devices do not have the capability to make personal phone calls, check social media or browse the internet, the spokesperson said.  Instead, the phones are pre-loaded with an application called SmartLINK as a way to track immigrants who have been released from detention and are awaiting a deportation hearing.  SmartLINK is part of ICE's Alternative to Detention program to closely track ""non-detained noncitizens at varying levels of supervision, using several different monitoring technologies,"" ICE’s spokesperson said.  The app requires someone to check in with immigration officials either by uploading a selfie or answering a call from their case manager, according to the Associated Press. The application was first used in 2018 - during President Donald Trump’s administration - to keep track of about 5,000 people, the AP reported. Now, ICE uses it to keep tabs on more than 125,000 immigrants. Not all immigrants detained by ICE get a government-issued device, the agency’s spokesperson said.  ""If a noncitizen acquires their own personally owned smartphone, the SmartLINK application can be loaded onto that device,"" the spokesperson said.  SmartLINK was developed by BI Inc., a subsidiary of The GEO Group, a private prison company.  White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki acknowledged the smartphones during a briefing on April 8, saying it's one of several ways the government can track someone after being released from detention.   We reached out twice to Wittman’s office for comment and did not get a reply. Similar comments mischaracterizing the tracking program have been made by conservative pundit Nick Adams and by former Trump attorney Jay Sekulow and his son, Jordan. PolitiFact National rated Adams’ comment Half True.  ""They’re going to be giving these people who come across the border, giving them smartphones,"" Wittman said on radio. ""Listen, I know a lot of people across our district who would like a smartphone."" The smartphones given to some immigrants detained by ICE are used to track them with a pre-installed application after they are released from custody. The phones cannot be used for anything else. ICE has been using the phones and the tracking application since 2018.  Wittman’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details and context.

The post shows a man in a ""DeSantis 2022"" red hat holding a bullhorn in front of two parked cars with their hoods up on a road.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The protest was not held in front of the Magic Kingdom, the main theme park in the sprawling Disney property, which can be reached from multiple routes by vehicle. Nor was it in front of any Disney theme park. It was held at the intersection of S.R. 535 and Hotel Plaza Blvd., according to the Orange County Sheriff’s Office and an April 13 press release from Moms for America, which organized the protest. That location is about 8 miles from the Magic Kingdom, according to Google Maps. The protest was near a large sign for Walt Disney World Resorts in front of Hotel Plaza Blvd. That road leads, as its name suggests, to various hotels and to Disney Springs, a shopping, dining and entertainment district on the east side of the resort property that visitors don’t need a ticket to enter. An interactive map from Disney shows Disney Springs is on the outskirts of the property on the east side. The road also connects with Buena Vista Drive, which visitors can take to get to various theme parks and resorts on the property.  The image in the Facebook post shows the poster in front of two cars supposedly blocking the entrance, with palm trees in the background. It’s not clear where he is standing, but a Google Maps street view shows no palm trees behind the Disney sign at the entrance, though there are some across the street behind a shopping center. The Orange County Sheriff’s Office said in a statement to PolitiFact that no roads were blocked during the protest and no one was prevented from entering the Disney property. There were no arrests and about 150 people attended the protest, which was the only one that day, officials said. A statement from Moms for America said organizers saw no one blocking the entrance to the property and that the protest was held on the sidewalk. The group said about 2,000 people attended throughout the day, and that the author of the Facebook post is not affiliated with the organization. According to local TV news reports, about 100 protesters attended, among them conservative politicians like congressional candidates Anthony Sabatini and Laura Loomer. No reports mentioned roads being blocked or any arrests. Disney did not respond to a request for comment. A Facebook post claimed that a ""Patriot Convoy"" of protesters on April 16 successfully blocked visitors from entering Disney World in Florida. There was a protest that day, but it was at an intersection on the outskirts of the large Walt Disney World Resort property. The local sheriff’s office and the protest’s organizers said no roads were blocked and no one was prevented from entering the property.  We rate this claim False.

No, living with someone who is HIV positive doesn’t mean you’ll get it, too
","Human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, is a virus that attacks the immune system and can lead to AIDS. A recent Facebook post warns that if you live with someone who has HIV, you’re likely to contract it. ""If your roommate catches HIV, you will be exposed to it and will probably contract it too, given long enough,"" the post says. ""There is no cure."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Most people get HIV through anal or vaginal sex or by sharing needles or other equipment used to inject drugs, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. As for oral sex, interacting in a workplace, getting medical care, eating food handled by someone with HIV, biting or spitting, kissing, and touching, ""there is little to no risk of getting HIV,"" the CDC says. ""For transmission to occur, something very unusual would have to happen.""  HIV doesn’t survive long outside the human body, so it’s not transmitted by mosquitoes, ticks or other insects; through saliva, tears or sweat; by hugging, shaking hands, sharing toilets, or sharing dishes; or through the air.  Plus, for HIV-positive folks who are engaged in sexual activity, there is medication available that can keep their viral load down, giving them ""effectively no risk of sexually transmitting HIV to their HIV-negative partners."" That’s because you can only get HIV by coming into direct contact with certain bodily fluids from someone with HIV who has a detectable viral load, HIV.gov explains on its website.  Johns Hopkins Medicine has a few suggestions for protecting yourself against HIV: don’t have sex or share needles. And if you do have sex, use a condom, get tested for HIV and make sure your partners do, too. Notably, it doesn’t discourage people from living with someone who has HIV as a means of protection. That’s because it’s not accurate that you will probably contract HIV if your roommate has it. In 2009, a New York Times columnist dealt with a question from the roommate of someone who was HIV positive. ""I believe he need not tell housemates about his status,"" the person seeking advice wrote, but added that ""many disagree, saying that household items — a razor, a toothbrush — could be used accidentally.""  The Times quoted epidemiologist Dr. Paul Marantz, who said that ""the risk of transmission from household contacts is very low.""  We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2022/apr/19/facebook-posts/no-living-someone-who-hiv-positive-doesnt-mean-you/

CNN did not tweet about children in Ukraine signing up to fight in the war
","An Instagram post appears to show a screenshot of a tweet from CNN about child soldiers in Ukraine, but the tweet was fabricated. The April 15 post says CNN tweeted about ""brave children"" in Ukraine signing up to fight Russia. The post’s profile photo shows CNN’s logo alongside Twitter’s signature blue check mark that means the account is verified. The text on the fake tweet says, ""As fighting intensifies in Eastern Ukraine, brave children sign up to fight the Russian invaders. We spoke to one girl, named Olga from Zaporizhzhia, aged 12, who tells her story of taking up arms to fight invading Russian troops."" It includes a photo of children wearing fatigues and standing in formation, with a text overlay that says, ""CNN supporting use of child soldiers."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) CNN told Associated Press and Reuters fact checkers that the tweet is not real. The tweet, which is dated April 11, does not appear on the network’s Twitter page or in online archives. The AP also noted that ""there are no tweets showing other users reacting to such a post, which would still be visible even if the original had been deleted."" CNN did not respond to PolitiFact’s request for information. The photo in the post was taken in 2017. It was published in a March 30, 2022, story by CNN about the Azov Battalion of the Ukraine military. In that story, the photo caption says it was taken outside Kyiv on July 14, 2017, and shows ""a student at a paramilitary camp for children call(ing) the rank to attention."" The AP confirmed with the photographer, Alex Masi, that it was taken at a ""summer camp from 2016-17, where kids learn about the realities of war.""
