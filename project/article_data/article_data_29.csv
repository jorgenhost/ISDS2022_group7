Trump hotels would be barred from getting coronavirus money
","At one of President Donald Trump’s daily news conferences on the coronavirus, a reporter referenced a bill that was being debated in the Senate to provide billions of dollars in relief for state and local governments, as well as the cruise and hotel industries. ""Will you commit publicly that none of that taxpayer money will go towards your own personal properties?"" Trump was asked. Trump didn’t make that commitment. He responded by saying that he hadn’t been thanked for forgoing his salary and said: ""So I’ve learned — let’s just see what happens because we have to save some of these great companies. They can be great companies, literally, in a matter of weeks. We have to save them."" The following day, March 23, 2020, a post on Facebook claimed: ""Donald Trump would receive $17 million for 3 hotels closed for 4 days under Republican bill! How in the hell is this right?!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) No such provision ever surfaced. In the wee hours of March 25, 2020, the Senate reached agreement on a roughly $2 trillion bill in response to the pandemic that includes $500 billion to help distressed businesses, as well as aid to the jobless and direct payments to taxpayers. The bill passed 96-0 on March 26 and moved on to the House. In its final form, the Senate bill included a provision, insisted upon by Democrats, to block Trump family businesses — and those controlled by other senior government officials or their immediate families — from receiving loan money under the programs. That conflict-of-interest provision applies to the president, the vice president, the head of an executive department, or a member of Congress; and the spouse, child, son-in-law, or daughter-in-law of those officials. Businesses they control are not eligible for money from a $500 billion fund to be set up to provide aid to municipalities, states and businesses that incurred losses as a result of the coronavirus. The president’s real estate empire could still benefit from other parts of the bill, the New York Times reported. Some hotel owners will be eligible for small-business loans, a provision that could potentially help Trump’s company continue to pay wages for its employees. The Trump Organization could also benefit from the $15 billion change to the tax code won by restaurants and retailers, the Times said. A Facebook post said, ""Donald Trump would receive $17 million for three hotels closed for four days under Republican bill! How in the hell is this right?!"" In discussions about legislation that would provide federal relief to businesses hurt by the coronavirus, Trump did not rule out the possibility that his businesses would apply for such aid. But no GOP bill contained language that would have given hotels owned by the Trump family $17 million. And a relief bill passed by the Senate would actually prohibit businesses owned by Trump, his family, or other top government officials from tapping into a $500 billion pool of aid to businesses, though the Trump hotels could benefit from other provisions of the aid bill.

Widespread Facebook post overstates Canadian government’s coronavirus response
","Facebook users are sharing a post that credits Canada with responding to the novel coronavirus in ways the United States has not. But the post muddles some details of Canada’s response. ""All schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notif(ied) to suspend mortgage payments for at least six months, and student loans deferred,"" the March 21 Facebook post says.  ""Imagine if the United States did this,"" it says. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In reality, schools in Canada’s provinces have not yet been shut down through the year’s end. The Facebook post also mischaracterized the employment insurance measures that Canada implemented to provide income support for Canadians who miss work due to the coronavirus. Canada’s 10 provinces and three territories have mandated school closures ""with varying dates, which in some cases coincide with the term break,"" according to UNESCO.  As of March 25, here’s what each of Canada’s provinces has decided for its schools: Alberta: Schools are closed ""until further notice."" British Columbia: Schools are closed indefinitely. Manitoba: Schools are closed until at least April 10. New Brunswick: Schools are closed until at least March 30. Newfoundland and Labrador: Schools are closed indefinitely. Nova Scotia: Schools are closed until at least April 6. Ontario: Schools are closed until at least April 6. Prince Edward Island: Schools are closed until at least April 6. Quebec: Schools are closed until at least May 1. Saskatchewan: Schools are closed indefinitely. In sum, the Facebook post overstated the extent of Canada’s school closures, although the situation could change. All 10 provinces have shut down schools for some length of time, but as of March 25, no province had ordered schools closed for the rest of the school year. The Facebook post also mischaracterized Canada’s economic response to the coronavirus. On March 18, Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced several actions, some of which were replaced in the final legislation, that the government would take to temper the economic burden faced by Canadians.  Canadians should not have to worry about paying their rent or mortgage or buying groceries because of the #COVID19 crisis. Learn how the Government of Canada is taking action to support workers and their families: https://t.co/G3Z1Ean0Mx pic.twitter.com/aukpQcOmXf For starters, the government implemented ""a six-month, interest-free, moratorium on Canada Student Loan payments for all individuals who are in the process of repaying these loans"" and secured ""a six-month payment deferral for mortgages,"" according to the press release. The government also pledged to introduce an emergency care benefit to provide pay for people who miss work due to the coronavirus and do not have access to paid sick leave.  The benefit would have provided ""up to $900 bi-weekly for up to 15 weeks"" to Canadian workers who are sick, quarantined, under instructions to self-isolate or taking care of a family member or child who is sick, quarantined, self-isolating or home from school due to closures. That’s not $950 — nor is it worth the same amount in American dollars — and it would not have gone to ""each family"" every two weeks, as the Facebook post wrongly claimed.  The emergency care benefit would have applied only to workers impacted by COVID-19, while an expansion of child benefits would have delivered more money to families with children. More importantly, the emergency care benefit and another proposed benefit for workers facing unemployment were eventually replaced by the ""Emergency Response Benefit,"" which will give $2,000 a month for up to four months for workers who lose their income due to COVID-19. A spokesperson for the Canadian minister of finance’s office directed us to a press release detailing the new and more generous benefit, which was enacted into law on March 25.  We’re doing everything we can to support you right now. Because at a time like this, you should be focused on what matters most - your health and the health of those you love. That’s exactly why we’re announcing the new Canada Emergency Response Benefit today. ⤵️ The $2,000 per month is roughly the same as $950 every two weeks. But again, it will only apply to workers who lose income due to the coronavirus. It won’t apply to ""each family."" A government webpage detailing Canada’s efforts to support individuals outlines the emergency response benefit, the six-month moratorium placed on student loans and the flexibility provided to borrowers who need to defer up to six monthly mortgage payments. A Facebook post said: ""All schools in Canada are closed for the rest of the school year, each family will receive $950 every two weeks for the next 15 weeks, banks were notif(ied) to suspend mortgage payments for at least six months, and student loans deferred."" The post is right about mortgage payments and student loans. But it overstates the impact of Canada’s new employment insurance benefits and exaggerates the extent of school closures.

Fact-checking claim on Australia’s borders closure
","The coronavirus pandemic has prompted temporary border closures around the globe. Is Australia closing its borders for six months, as some online posts suggest? It’s possible, but that hasn’t been determined. ""Australia Closing Borders in a few hours for 6-months,"" said the headline of a March 20 post on sydneynews.sydney, shared on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The headline in sydneynews.sydney gives the impression that the 6-month time frame is a certainty. That’s not the case. Other news outlets, including the Guardian and Sky News, have posted more cautious headlines, saying the borders ""could be closed for six months."" Australia’s Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced March 19 that Australia would close its borders to all non-citizens and non-residents on March 20 at 9 p.m. Australian Eastern Daylight Time. (Exemptions apply for close immediate family members of Australian residents and citizens.) The travel ban is part of a series of measures Australia is taking to slow the spread of the coronavirus. The government said that about 80% of coronavirus cases in Australia were people who caught the virus overseas or people in contact with individuals who returned from overseas. The Australian government has said that the virus could be around for at least six months and that Australians should brace for disruptions in daily life. Whether the ban lasts six months is uncertain, as it’s exact duration has not been determined. In media interviews, Australia’s Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the travel ban would last as long as medical experts say it’s necessary, but that it was hard to put a precise date on when the ban would be lifted. Here’s an exchange he had March 19 with Patricia Karvelas of ABC Radio National, according to a government transcript: Karvelas: ""So just, again, level with us. Could this travel ban last for six months at least?"" Frydenberg: ""The travel ban will last as long as the medical experts tell us that we need to prevent the spread of the virus, and one way to do that is through the steps that announced today."" Karvelas: ""So you accept that it could be closed. I just want to nail down a timeframe for this six-month period that we're looking at."" Frydenberg: ""You're asking me to put a date on something that not even the medical experts can put a date on."" Karvelas: ""No, but the Prime Minister has put a date on it. He said for six months you can expect these changes, so I expect that's the timeframe."" Frydenberg: ""To be fair to him, he actually said six months at least."" Karvelas: ""Does that mean a travel ban could even be longer than six months?"" Frydenberg: ""Again, as your listeners would expect us to do, we follow the medical advice and not even the medical experts know how long the spread of the virus will continue and the date upon which a vaccine will be found."" An online post said, ""Australia Closing Borders in a few hours for 6-months."" Officials have said the coronavirus outbreak and related disruptions in Australia could last at least six months. To slow the spread of the virus, Australia has banned entry to non-Australian residents and citizens and their immediate families. But it has not determined whether the travel ban will last six months. Officials say it will remain in effect until it’s safe to lift, but have not given a specific date for its end date.

Donald Trump’s comparison of US, South Korea coronavirus testing is wrong. Here's why
","Boasting about his administration’s response to the novel coronavirus — and arguing the outbreak would soon be under control — President Donald Trump claimed that recent American efforts to test widely for COVID-19 surpass those of other countries. ""We've done more tests in eight days than South Korea has done in eight weeks,"" Trump said during a March 24 virtual town hall hosted by Fox News, re-iterating a statement made just moments prior by Dr. Deborah Birx, the head of the White House coronavirus response. The statement was repeated during the White House briefing that evening. Trump doubled down the next day, tweeting that ""over an eight day span, the United States now does more testing than what South Korea (which has been a very successful tester) does over an eight week span."" Why the comparison with South Korea? South Korea has been heralded globally for its swift response to the pandemic, which appears to have slowed its rate of new infections. Meanwhile, a national shortage of tests has hamstrung American efforts, resulting in many people at risk being forced to delay testing until they are seriously ill. With that context, we were curious. Is the president’s claim accurate? Has American testing been as robust as his statement indicates? We contacted the White House and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but we never heard back. But the numbers suggest his picture is inaccurate and, more importantly, missing crucial context to understanding the battle against COVID-19. South Korea publishes a daily report of how many tests it’s performed. As of March 24, about 348,582 people had been tested, and testing began in early February. About 9,000 of those people were confirmed positives for the virus. (The 345,582 figure includes tests that were run, but hadn’t yet yielded a positive or negative answer.) In the United States, it’s harder to tell. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention doesn’t put out updated, aggregated counts of tests performed in public and private labs — which is important. Since the start of March, a large chunk of American-done tests have been conducted in commercial — not government-run — labs. Experts pointed us to a credible tally that suggests that, on the raw numbers, the president’s stat is flawed. The COVID Tracking Project, a dataset managed and updated by volunteer journalists and scientists, estimates that, as of March 24, American labs performed a total of 359,000 tests for COVID-19. That number comes from state and local health departments around the country, including testing done in both public and commercial labs. Between March 15 and March 24, the United States conducted about 331,000 tests, per the tracker. The raw comparison, then, suggests that the United States’ eight-day tally falls short of South Korea’s eight-week tally. Out of curiosity, we looked at the March 23 data for South Korea as well. At that point, they had run 338,036 tests. So even if Trump was off by a day, the American figure still falls short. More importantly, experts reminded us, this raw-data comparison isn’t that meaningful. If you want to compare between the two countries, you need to look at the bigger picture. More effective comparisons Put simply, ""raw numbers are not the best metric, given population size differences,"" said Jennifer Kates, a global health researcher at the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation. (Kaiser Health News is an editorially independent program of the foundation.) That’s because the United States is simply a much larger country than South Korea — about 327 million people, compared to about 51.5 million. To account for that, researchers serious about comparing the nations’ responses would adjust to per-capita rates of testing. That shows the extent to which the number of tests performed accounts for helping people at risk of infection. ""If a country has five people in it, of course they could only have five tests,"" said Dr. Robert Gallo, director of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and a co-discoverer of HIV. When you control for population, the American response compares poorly. Its current tally of 359,000 tests per 327 million people comes out to about 1,084 tests per million. South Korea has run closer to 6,768 tests per million. Put another way, South Korea’s testing rate for coronavirus is more than 6 times that of the American rate. To catch up, Kates noted, American labs would need to perform 2.24 million more tests — not an insurmountable task, but definitely a lift. It’s not just the number of tests performed, either. Researchers have stressed repeatedly that the timing of when the tests were run is also a big part of the equation. Both nations reported their first cases on the same day, Jan. 20. In the entire month of February, American labs ran fewer than 1,000 coronavirus tests, per the volunteer COVID tracker. (Government health officials had begun sounding the alarm in January.) By Feb. 29, South Korea had completed more than 55,000 tests, with almost 30,000 awaiting confirmation, for a total of more than 80,000 tests performed. ""For the assertion … the U.S. has done more #COVID19 testing in the last 8 days than South Korea cumulatively, that doesn't mean anything,"" tweeted Dr. Eric Topol, a physician and researcher. ""Nearly 0 tests were done for 2 months when they were desperately needed."" Many public health researchers say the U.S. is still not running enough diagnostics daily to meet demand — arguing that, though there has been significant improvement, labs need to be doing about 150,000 tests per day. Right now, the COVID tracker suggests about 65,000 tests are being run per day. While that is a substantial increase from even a week ago, it’s still well below the target number. Beyond testing, there’s the question of what happened after results were confirmed. Patients infected, epidemiologists argue, should be targeted, caught early and quickly separated from other people. That’s a key step to stopping the spread of the virus – and something that still hasn’t happened on a large scale. ""South Korea followed up tests vigorously to support isolation and quarantine — the steps needed to reduce spread,"" said Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for Public Health Practice and Community Engagement at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore. ""The U.S. has a long ways to go to develop this critical capacity."" Trump claimed that the United States has ""done more tests in eight days than South Korea has done in eight weeks."" The CDC has not put out comprehensive data on this. But independent work on the subject suggests the comparison is flawed. In eight days, the United States performed almost as many tests as South Korea did in eight weeks, but not necessarily more. In addition, that statistic is relatively less important. The American rate of testing per capita is more than six times lower than South Korea’s. It’s certainly possible to catch up, but that hasn’t happened yet. The president’s statement frames the data in a way that is misleading and doesn’t accurately represent the status of the American response to COVID-19. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B96F80>],/factchecks/2020/mar/25/donald-trump/trumps-boast-about-us-south-korea-coronavirus-test/

Audio shared on Facebook Messenger spreads false information about coronavirus prevention
","A false post about COVID-19 is being shared in a new format on Facebook. In an audio message that a reader sent us on March 23, a woman with a British accent lists 10 ways that people can avoid being infected with the coronavirus. The message claims to be based on research from Chinese scientists. ""It was sent to me by a colleague who has a friend that works at Dr. Negrin, which is the main hospital on our island,"" says the woman on the audio message. ""It’s obviously in Spanish, so I’m just going to read it and translate it for you."" University Hospital of Gran Canaria Dr. Negrin is located in the city of Las Palmas on Gran Canaria, one of Spain’s Canary Islands. The island chain’s tourism industry has been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. Here’s some of the questionable medical advice in the audio message that caught our eye: If some of those claims sound familiar, it’s because many of them have been circulating on social media in some form since January, when the World Health Organization addressed a slew of COVID-19 rumors on Twitter. We’ve also debunked several bogus coronavirus prevention and treatment methods. But this audio message was new to us, so we decided to check out each of the five claims. All of them either lack evidence or have been debunked by public health officials. This is inaccurate — we rated a similar claim False. While health experts recommend drinking water regularly to stay healthy, there is no evidence that sipping some every 20 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection.  The primary way the virus spreads is through close contact with infected people and respiratory droplets, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. When someone with the coronavirus coughs or sneezes, their germs land on surfaces around them. The virus then infects people who touch those surfaces and then their eyes, nose or mouth. So to prevent contracting the coronavirus, the CDC advises people to avoid touching their face as much as possible. Other ways to prevent infection include washing your hands with soap and water, covering your coughs and sneezes with a tissue and regularly sanitizing the surfaces in your home or at your workstation. As of now, there is no specific treatment for the virus. In a tweet published Feb. 7, the WHO said it does not advise people to drink water as a way to avoid coronavirus infection. While air-drying your clothes may save you some money on your electricity bill, there is no evidence it will kill the coronavirus. We’ve rated similar claims False. There is ample evidence that viruses, including human coronaviruses, don’t like heat. Influenza, for example, thrives in dry, cold weather, which is one reason the flu season typically spans from fall to spring. And high-intensity UV light can kill viruses.  RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself But that doesn’t mean sun exposure kills the coronavirus. Experts told us natural sunlight doesn’t provide the UV intensity needed to kill the virus, and the WHO says on its website that COVID-19 can be transmitted in all climates, ""including areas with hot and humid weather."" Neither the WHO nor the CDC lists sunlight exposure as a method to kill the coronavirus. In fact, the WHO has debunked the claim, saying ""there is no evidence that sunlight kills the new coronavirus."" Public health officials say washing your hands is one of the primary ways to prevent COVID-19 infection. But if you’re healthy and in self-isolation, there is probably little reason to lather up so frequently. The CDC recommends washing your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds at a time — ""especially after you have been in a public place, or after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing."" On its website, UNICEF lists a few more examples of when people should wash their hands: ""after touching surfaces outside the home, including money; before, during and after caring for a sick person; and before and after eating."" So if you’re doing any of those things every 20 minutes, you may want to wash your hands.  This claim is baseless. As we’ve covered before, there is evidence that human coronaviruses don’t like heat. But just as there’s no scientific proof that hot things prevent COVID-19, there’s no proof that cold things make you more susceptible. This claim is similar to one made in a fake UNICEF handout that circulated on Facebook in early March. It said people should ""stay away from ice cream and eating cold"" to avoid contracting COVID-19. In a statement, UNICEF debunked that claim. On its website, the WHO did, too. ""There is no scientific evidence that eating hygienically made frozen food and ice-cream spreads the new coronavirus,"" the organization says. There’s no evidence to support this. An article published in the New England Journal of Medicine on March 17 tested how long the coronavirus, formally called SARS-CoV-2, lived on five different surfaces: aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper and cardboard. ""SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols throughout the duration of our experiment (3 hours),"" the authors wrote. ""SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and stainless steel than on copper and cardboard."" RELATED: Novel coronavirus could live up to 3 days, depending on the surface Aside from air, the least hospitable medium for the virus was copper; researchers could detect viable virus particles there for only up to four hours. On cardboard, they could not detect any after 24 hours. The coronavirus lives the longest on plastic and stainless steel — up to three days. That’s far from nine days, as the audio message claimed. And while the journal article hasn’t been peer-reviewed, its findings are similar to those of other researchers. An article published in the Journal of Hospital Infection in March reviewed what other scientists have found about the surface viability of various coronaviruses that infect humans, such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), which are both similar to COVID-19. The authors wrote that scientists found some of these viruses could live for up to five days on steel, and eight hours on aluminum. Another study they cited found a SARS virus strain remaining viable for up to five days on an unspecified metal. The article did find that one strain of SARS could live for up to nine days on plastic surfaces. But two other strains of the virus remained viable for only five days or less, and MERS could live for only up to 48 hours at a certain temperature. More recently, a March 23 report from the CDC said novel coronavirus RNA was found on surfaces on the Diamond Princess cruise ship 17 days after passengers disembarked. That finding raised questions about whether the coronavirus can last longer on some surfaces than previously thought, but researchers have noted that viral RNA doesn’t necessarily mean live virus was present. A chain audio message on Facebook Messenger lists 10 ways to prevent infection from COVID-19. We fact-checked five and found them inaccurate. First, there is no evidence that sipping water every 20 minutes can help prevent coronavirus infection. There is also no evidence that exposing your clothing to the sun will kill the coronavirus. Health officials recommend that people avoid touching their face and wash their hands for at least 20 seconds at a time —  not every 20 minutes, as the message claims. There’s also no evidence that consuming cold things makes you more susceptible to the virus. Finally, while the science is far from settled, there’s no proof that the coronavirus can live for up to nine days on metallic surfaces. The best available evidence suggests that it can remain viable on stainless steel for up to three days. We rate the claims False.

Bill Gates warned in 2015 that we were unprepared for an infectious virus
","You can’t say Bill Gates didn’t tell you so, according to a recent Facebook post. 
  ""Bill Gates told us about the coronavirus in 2015,"" claims the March 15 video published on the social media platform. The video begins with the Microsoft co-founder standing on stage underneath a giant projector screen. ""The greatest risk of global catastrophe doesn’t look like this,"" Gates says as behind him appears a giant image of a bomb exploding.  ""Instead,"" Gates continues, ""it looks like this."" The picture overhead changes to what appears to be a giant microbe, an image similar to the graphics that news organizations and others use to illustrate their stories about the new coronavirus . ""If anything kills a million people over the next few decades, it’s most likely to be a highly infectious virus rather than a war,"" Gates says. ""Not missiles, but microbes.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Gates did say these words on a stage. And the images that appear in the video on Facebook did show on a screen behind him as he spoke. But this post goes too far by suggesting Gates specifically predicted COVID-19. No mention of coronavirus in Gates’ original 2015 speech  On March 19, Gates published a blog post addressing questions about COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus that was first reported in Wuhan, China, on Dec. 31, 2019. The post is an edited transcript of an Ask Me Anything session he did on Reddit on March 18. In it, he refers to a TED talk he did in 2015. Footage from this talk is what appears in the Facebook video.  The Facebook video is only a clip of Gates’ comments. The actual talk begins with him discussing how when he was a kid, the disaster Americans feared most was a nuclear war. But his line that opens the Facebook video comes soon after. He goes on to say that ""we’ve actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic. We’re not ready for the next epidemic.""  He doesn’t use the word ""coronavirus"" in his speech. He does discuss Ebola and the failures in combating the disease’s outbreak in West Africa in 2014 — the largest Ebola outbreak since the virus was discovered in 1976, according to the World Health Organization. In aftermath of Ebola, Gates did warn of another epidemic   About 10,000 people died during the Ebola outbreak and nearly all deaths were in West Africa, Gates said in his TED talk. The disease didn’t spread more, in part, because it didn’t spread through the air, and by the time patients are contagious, they’re generally so sick they’re bedridden.  ""The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola,"" Gates said. ""Next time we might not be so lucky. You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they’re infectious that they get on a plane or they go to a market. The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola, or it could be bioterrorism. So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse."" Gates cited the 1918 Spanish flu as an example of a virus that spreads through the air.  ""So here’s what would happen,"" he says. ""It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly. And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic. So this is a serious problem. We should be concerned."" He then discusses how we could build a good response system — how we could be prepared for the next epidemic.  ""There’s no need to panic,"" he says. ""We don’t have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down to the basement. But we need to get going, because time is not on our side. In fact, if there’s one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic, it’s that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready. If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic."" Our ruling The Facebook post says that Gates told Americans about the coronavirus in 2015. But in the 2015 TED talk featured in the video, he never actually uses the word coronavirus, nor does he mention COVID-19.  His comments do sound prescient, though. He talks about an epidemic and we’re now in the midst of a pandemic. People could be infected with COVID-19 and not show symptoms for days, if at all. And it’s mainly spread between people in close contact through respiratory droplets when someone coughs or sneezes.

Beware of rumors of robbers posing as COVID testers
","As if COVID-19 didn’t spread enough fear on its own, now there is a warning that people sheltering in their homes may become targets of crime.

Donald Trump misses key facts in claim that New York governor refused to buy ventilators in 2015
","President Donald Trump didn’t like that New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said on TV that the federal government should provide the state stockpiled ventilators to help New Yorkers battling the coronavirus pandemic. Trump said his administration was helping Cuomo, and Cuomo ""shouldn't be talking about us, he’s supposed to be buying his own ventilators."" Trump used a moment in his Fox News town hall to say Cuomo had the chance a few years ago. ""Right here, I just got this out,"" Trump said March 24, shuffling through papers. ""This says New York Governor Cuomo rejected buying recommended 16,000 ventilators in 2015 for the pandemic, for a pandemic, established death panels and lotteries instead. So, he had a chance to buy, in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down. I’m not blaming him or anything else."" New York is, as of March 25, the worst-hit spot in the United States, with more than 25,000 people diagnosed with COVID-19, the disease caused by the new coronavirus. Cuomo has repeatedly said New York needs thousands more ventilators and that the federal government should lend ventilators it has in its reserves. PolitiFact wondered if Trump was right that Cuomo a few years ago rejected buying ventilators, and ""established death panels and lotteries instead."" He’s not.
The White House did not reply to our requests for evidence backing Trump’s claim. But Trump appeared to be reading, word-for-word, a March 22 headline on the Gateway Pundit, a conservative website. The website linked to a March 18 post on creators.com, by Betsy McCaughey, a Republican who served as lieutenant governor of New York in the 1990s. McCaughey’s post said that Cuomo in 2015 ""could have chosen to buy more ventilators"" after learning that the state’s stockpile had 16,000 fewer ventilators than needed in case of a ""severe"" pandemic. Instead, a task force drafted rules for rationing the ventilators they already had, McCaughey wrote. ""Patients assigned a red code will have the highest access, and other patients will be assigned green, yellow or blue (the worst) depending on a ‘triage officer's decision. In truth, a death officer. Let's not sugarcoat it. It won't be up to your own doctor,"" she wrote. Cuomo, a Democrat, has been New York’s governor since 2011. New York’s health department in 2015, as part of its emergency preparedness plans, issued a report on ventilator allocation guidelines the state could follow if it had to deal with an influenza pandemic. It modeled data to examine scenarios under a ""moderate"" pandemic (1957 and 1968 flu pandemics characteristics) and a ""severe"" pandemic (similar to the 1918 pandemic). A task force estimated that under a severe scenario, more than 800,000 people would be hospitalized, and during peak week demand, around 18,600 ventilators would be needed. During that peak week, the state would likely be short about 16,000 ventilators, the report said. (Under a moderate scenario, the state would have a surplus during the peak week.) The state had ""no current plans"" to buy enough ventilators for the most severe scenario, the report said. ""The state’s current approach to stockpiling a limited number of ventilators balances the need to prepare for a potential pandemic against the need to maintain adequate funding for current and ongoing health care expenses,"" the report said. Buying ventilators beyond a threshold would not save more lives because there wouldn’t be enough trained staff to operate them anyway, the report said. And if the health care system became overwhelmed, the state wouldn’t have enough ventilators despite an emergency stockpile. The report does not indicate that the state had the funds to buy 16,000 additional ventilators ""at a very low price,"" as Trump said. It also does not say that the task force recommended to the governor buying 16,000, or that he turned down that suggestion. Cuomo’s communications director told PolitiFact that Trump ""obviously didn’t read the document he’s citing."" ""This was a five-year-old advisory task force report, which never recommended the state procure ventilators — it merely referenced that New York wouldn't be equipped with enough ventilators for a 1918 flu pandemic. No one is, including Mr. Trump,"" said Cuomo spokesperson Dani Lever. The phrase ""death panels"" dates back to 2009, when former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin used it to argue against President Barack Obama’s healthcare proposal. She argued that the government would ration medical care and that the elderly and disabled would suffer under such a plan. Trump and the Gateway Pundit article he appears to have quoted do not give a complete picture of the state’s findings. The state did acknowledge that in case of ventilator shortage, hospitals would need to make difficult decisions about what patients would get access to the available ventilators in order to save the most lives. It outlined protocols for adults, children, and infants less than 28 days old. Top priority would be given to patients with the highest likelihood of survival with ventilator therapy. Lower priority would be patients with the highest likelihood of survival without medical intervention, and patients with the smallest likelihood of survival with medical intervention. The report said hospitals had the option to designate a triage officer or triage committee to make these decisions. A patient’s attending physician would provide all clinical data to the officer or committee so that they could then determine the patient’s level of access to a ventilator. The state in 2015 said that race, ethnicity, sexual orientation, socio-economic status, advanced age, perceived quality of life, ability to pay, role in the community, or other subjective criteria would never be part of the evaluation in determining who receives ventilator therapy. The task force also explored non-clinical approaches, including a lottery system that randomly allocated ventilators. But the report said those non-clinical approaches should not be used as the primary method because they could be subjective and/or not support the goal of saving the most lives. The report also didn’t say its guidelines were final rules to follow. It said the guidelines were a ""living document, intended to be updated and revised"" based on new clinical information, societal norms, and feedback from clinicians and the public. Trump said Cuomo ""rejected buying recommended 16,000 ventilators in 2015 for the pandemic, for a pandemic, established death panels and lotteries instead. So, he had a chance to buy, in 2015, 16,000 ventilators at a very low price and he turned it down."" A 2015 state report said that in the case of a ""severe"" pandemic, the state would be short about 16,000 ventilators during peak week. But the report did not recommend buying 16,000 ventilators, and did not indicate whether the state was at a fiscal position to purchase them. The state did not plan to increase its stockpile because it anticipated that in the event of a severe crisis, there would be shortage of trained staff to operate them and demand would outweigh any emergency stockpile. The report said the state had to balance the likely ventilator shortage with the need for adequate funding for current and ongoing health care expenses. The report issued guidelines on ventilator allocation if there weren’t enough for everyone and suggested that hospitals designate a triage officer or committee. It explored a lottery system, but did not recommend it as the primary option. Cuomo did not establish one. Trump’s statement is inaccurate.

No, Gov. Tony Evers is not pushing gun confiscation. Old claim was wrong then, is ridiculous now
","A year-old claim about Gov. Tony Evers and firearm confiscation is getting new life online amid the coronavirus pandemic. Many on Facebook have recently picked up a story from April 2019 headlined ""Wisconsin gov. pushing firearm confiscation orders."" When shared, no date for the story is visible on Facebook. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The new life and lack of date gives this claim a very different ring amid the flurry of executive orders by Evers. The first-term Democrat has taken a series of dramatic steps to limit activity in Wisconsin as he and officials across the country take steps to contain the spread of coronavirus. His latest ""Safe at Home"" order, issued Tuesday, March 24, 2020, closed non-essential businesses and gathering places until April 24. But none of those orders deals with gun confiscations. The headline was misleading in 2019. Surfaced a year later, it’s downright ridiculous. The article, from a website called Steadfast and Loyal, describes Evers as ""attacking the Second Amendment."" But it offers zero proof for that claim or the headline reference to the governor ""pushing firearm confiscation orders."" Instead it pastes in a series of paragraphs from a similarly headlined story from far-right Breitbart news, published back in January 2019. But neither story actually details Evers proposing any such thing. The Breitbart story — as quoted by Steadfast and Loyal — refers to a WISN-TV story about Attorney General Josh Kaul, a Democrat, calling for red flag laws during his inaugural address. We will note, though the stories didn’t, that Evers had generally voiced support for Kaul’s plan in January 2019. But there’s a huge difference between red flag laws and the widespread gun seizures implied by this headline. Red flag laws provide a mechanism — with a judge’s approval — to take guns from people exhibiting dangerous behavior before they harm themselves or others. RELATED: Do red flag laws allow gun seizure without a judge’s OK? RELATED: Wisconsin Assembly Speaker's new take on red-flag gun laws still misses target At the time the Steadfast and Loyal article was written, Evers hadn’t proposed anything in this vein, but he later did, in November 2019. He called a special session of the Legislature to consider proposals for a red flag law and universal background checks, but Republicans who control the Assembly and Senate immediately closed the session without action. Under Evers’ proposal, a law enforcement officer, family member or household member could petition a judge to intervene if they believe an individual is a danger to self or others. The judge then could issue a preliminary order good for up to 14 days, during which the guns could be taken away. A judge would then schedule a full hearing, where the gun owner could present his or her case and the judge could issue a final order valid for up to one year. A year-old story now circulating again on Facebook says Evers is ""pushing firearm confiscation orders."" That was an overreach in 2019, and it’s even more absurd now. The article was referring to red flag laws, but at the time of this post Evers hadn’t proposed one yet. And more importantly, red flag laws are a far cry from the implication this headline gives of some form of widespread gun confiscation.

Trump campaign ad is mostly right on provisions in Pelosi’s coronavirus bill
","As President Donald Trump’s negotiators were working with congressional leaders to assemble a coronavirus economic relief package, the president’s re-election campaign didn’t shy away from blasting one key Democratic leader, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif. On March 24, Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale shared a video focused on the coronavirus bill Pelosi had released the day before. It named a half-dozen provisions in the Take Responsibility for Workers and Families Act that the Trump campaign considered outside the scope of the current crisis. On screen, the ad says: ""Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats clog their coronavirus relief bill with leftist wishlist. Democrat bill includes: tax credits for solar and wind energy … emissions standards and carbon offset requirements for airlines … policing racial makeup of corporate boards … retirement plans for community newspaper employees … $300 million for PBS … climate change studies for civil aviation and aerospace industries. Democrats don’t care about your health or the economy. They only care about politics"" Democratic officials acknowledge that most of those provisions are in the bill, which at the time the ad was launched was taking a back seat to negotiations over a Senate bill. However, one of the provisions cited by the Trump campaign’s ad is not in the bill. A still from a Trump campaign ad targeting House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's coronavirus relief bill. Pelosi’s bill seeks to shape the behavior of any airlines that accept federal assistance to the benefit of their workers, customers and the environment. Carbon offsets are addressed in section 704 of the bill. Corporate board diversity, in the form of retrospective reporting requirements, is part of section 407, while the climate change study is in section 707. A statement provided by the Democratic leadership said that ""the extreme impacts that COVID-19 has had on corporate operations, the workforce, the lack of adequate contingency plans designed to protect worker interests and needs, and the impact this has had on the national economy highlights the need to have worker interests represented on corporate boards."" This language, in section 404, is largely drawn from H.R. 1916, a bill that has been introduced but not advanced. The bill would change rules for community newspapers’ defined-benefit pension plans. The Democratic leadership says this is part of an overall pension package to help cash flow for companies. This would be a supplemental appropriation for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which funds PBS and which is facing shortfalls due to the coronavirus, the Democratic leadership says. This is the one provision cited by the ad that is not actually in the House bill, despite pressure from the industry to include it. The campaign ad says that Pelosi’s coronavirus bill included provisions on ""tax credits for solar and wind energy … emissions standards and carbon offset requirements for airlines … policing racial makeup of corporate boards … retirement plans for community newspaper employees … $300 million for PBS … climate change studies for civil aviation and aerospace industries."" The ad is correct that five of those six provisions are in the House bill. The remaining provision, on tax credits for solar and wind, is not.

Drinking chloroquine fish-tank cleaner won’t stop the coronavirus. It might kill you
","An Arizona man is dead and his wife was hospitalized after the couple ingested a fish-tank solvent with chloroquine phosphate, the same active ingredient found in anti-malarial drugs that President Donald Trump has hailed as a possible treatment for the novel coronavirus. The woman told NBC News that the couple thought the drug compound Trump mentioned in a televised press conference was the same as the fish-tank cleaner they had in their home pantry. The two are not the same. Chloroquine, also known as chloroquine phosphate, is used in anti-malarial drugs available in the U.S. by prescription only, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A variant, hydroxychloroquine, is an arthritis medicine that can also prevent malaria.  The husband and wife were not alone in their confusion. A number of headlines describing the fatal mishap, including from mainstream news outlets, did not make it clear that the couple ingested fish-tank cleaner, rather than the drug form of chloroquine.  One headline published before the Arizona couple’s accident missed the distinction entirely. ""Fish tank additive may treat coronavirus,"" said a March 20 headline from Valley News Live, a local news network serving TV stations in North Dakota. That headline is wrong. Fish-tank cleaners containing chloroquine phosphate are not the same as the prescription drugs used for malaria. Nor are they suitable for human consumption. Moreover, as anti-viral drugs, chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine have shown the ability to combat some diseases, but they have not yet been proven to disrupt COVID-19.  RELATED: A 100% COVID-19 cure? No, chloroquine effectiveness only anecdotal Valley News Live did not respond to requests for comment by deadline.

""I just saw it sitting on the back shelf and said, ‘Hey, isn’t that that stuff they’re talking about on TV?’"" she said. She and her husband mixed about one teaspoon each with soda and drank the concoction as a preventative measure, she said. Trump has touted chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as potential coronavirus treatments, and he tweeted that hydroxychloroquine, combined with an antibiotic called azithromycin, could ""be one of the biggest game changers in the history of medicine.""

But Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, has said there had only been anecdotal evidence that the drugs could knock down COVID-19. The drugs are currently being studied and tested in clinical trials, according to the CDC. According to the New York Times, prices for the fish-tank additive have skyrocketed on eBay as the coronavirus has continued to spread through the U.S. and around the world. Drugs containing chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine are not yet proven to prevent, treat or cure patients of the coronavirus, as we’ve noted. A recent French study of 20 COVID-19 patients indicated that the prescription-drug version of chloroquine might help treat the disease.

""There are no US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of patients with COVID-19,"" the CDC says on its website. But the fish-tank cleaner is a definite no-no. In a statement, the FDA said Americans should be wary of products that claim to prevent, treat, diagnose or cure COVID-19. ""Products marketed for veterinary use or ‘for research only,’ or otherwise not for human consumption have not been evaluated for safety and should never be used,"" the FDA said. ""The FDA is aware that chloroquine is marketed as an unapproved drug to treat external parasites in aquarium fish, but these products have not been evaluated by FDA to determine if they are safe, effective, properly manufactured, and adequately labeled."" ""Don’t take any form of chloroquine unless it has been prescribed for you and obtained from legitimate sources,"" the agency said. A Valley News Live headline said, ""Fish tank additive may treat coronavirus."" Chloroquine, a compound commonly found in fish-tank cleaners, also forms the basis of a prescription drug used for malaria. There are studies underway to conclude whether that drug, and a variant called hydroxychloroquine, could combat the coronavirus.

Conservative group claims Stephen Sweeney gave New Jersey the nation’s highest income tax rates, driving out jobs
","
A conservative organization’s ad campaign paints a group of New Jersey Democrats as President Barack Obama’s minions -- and state Senate President Stephen Sweeney is among them.

The New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity launched last week a series of radio and television spots targeting incumbent legislators battling for re-election on Nov. 8. An ad criticizing Sweeney claims the South Jersey Democrat’s ""Obama-style policies"" are responsible for high unemployment in the state.

""How? Sweeney gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs. Sweeney backs cap and trade and raising electric rates, which will drive out more jobs. And Sweeney backs Obama’s job-destroying government health care plan and Obama's failed stimulus schemes,"" the ad says.

High taxes. Fewer jobs. We’ve heard -- and checked -- similar claims before, but never specifically on income tax rates.

So, did Sweeney give New Jersey the nation's highest income tax rate, driving jobs out of state?

Sweeney took office as a state Senator in 2002. Since then, New Jersey has never had the the highest income tax rate in the nation.

The state Legislature increased the top income tax rate in 2004 and 2009. Sweeney voted for both measures, but he’s just one vote among many and the governor signed both bills.

In 2004, New Jersey’s top income tax rate went from 6.37 percent on those making more than $75,000 to 8.97 percent on those making more than $500,000 with the so-called ""millionaires’ tax."" Several other states, including California, Montana and Vermont, all had higher income tax rates that year, according to data from the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group that studies tax policy.

In 2009, the state’s top income tax rate increased to 10.75 percent on incomes over $1 million.  Even then, Hawaii and Oregon had slightly larger top income tax rates of 11 percent.

The tax expired in 2010. Sweeney became the state Senate president the same year. He has tried twice since then to reinstate the ""millionaires’ tax,"" but Gov. Chris Christie vetoed both measures.

Steve Lonegan, director of the New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity, argued that all taxes, whether they are sales taxes or property taxes, ""conspire to be a tax of everyone’s income.""

But the ad clearly says New Jersey has the ""nation's highest income tax rate,"" while showing a photo of a New Jersey residential income tax form. So, on that point, the ad is wrong.

But are New Jersey’s income tax rates responsible for job loss?

Lonegan referred to a Tax Foundation study that ranked New Jersey as the worst in the nation for state and local tax burdens. And according to the tax research group, the Garden State ranks number one in that category.

But when it comes to the destruction of jobs, taxes may be one factor, but they aren’t the only factor.

""Everything matters,"" said Mark Robyn, an economist with the Tax Foundation. ""But taxes also matter.""

Ronald Alt, senior research associate with the Federation of Tax Administrators, said the argument that increasing the top income tax rates discourages people from taking risks and starting businesses ""really overstates the effect of the tax rates. There are a lot of other factors that come into play.""

Those factors, according to Alt, include: the level of education in the state, how close the business is to its market and suppliers, who the business is selling to and the overall cost of doing business in the state.

Our ruling

The New Jersey chapter of Americans for Prosperity launched an ad campaign targeting Democratic incumbents running for re-election. One television spot said, ""Sweeney gave us the nation's highest income tax rates, driving out jobs.""

During Sweeney’s tenure the top income tax rate in New Jersey increased twice. Neither of those tax hikes bumped New Jersey into the top spot in the nation for income taxes  -- and you can’t solely blame Sweeney for either increase. And the ad’s larger point that high incomes tax rates decreased jobs is overstated.

We rate this statement False.

President E. Gordon Gee says OSU’s athletic compliance department is a model for others to follow
","
Wearing a bow tie instead of shoulder pads, Ohio State University President E. Gordon Gee was nonetheless playing defense for the scarlet and gray on Oct 4. A day earlier, OSU Athletics Director Gene Smith sat three football players against Nebraska for accepting too much money for too little work at summer jobs.

It was the latest NCAA infraction in a string for Ohio State dating back to December 2010 that had now encompassed summer jobs, cash handed out a charity event and the infamous tattoos-for-trinkets scandal. In all, 12 scholarship football players had been punished for infractions, former head coach Jim Tressel had been fired and a long-time program booster had been exiled.

After his annual talk to faculty members, Gee told the Columbus Dispatch that the school’s athletics compliance office — the folks in charge of discovering, reporting and preventing NCAA violations — was a model for other schools to follow.

""We are the poster child for compliance, and whenever we discover possible infractions we resolve and report it to the NCAA no matter how minor the violations,"" Gee said. ""That’s what we have done here.""

PolitiFact Ohio normally sticks to checking the statements of Ohio’s leading political figures, but it’s not much of a stretch to view Gee as a political figure of sorts. (Gov. John Kasich has referred to him as Ohio’s greatest politician.)

So we decided to buckle up our helmet and dig into whether Ohio State’s compliance office really is the ""poster child"" for universities across the country.

First, we reached out to OSU spokesman Jim Lynch to see what he could provide to back up the notion that OSU really has the finest athletics compliance department in the nation. Lynch pointed out that the NCAA had not found major violations in any of the cases and has told OSU officials it does not see a lack of institutional control. (That’s NCAA-speak for a systematic problem.)

Lynch referred PolitiFact to OSU’s official responses to the charges, which stress that Ohio State’s compliance office has at all times faithfully reported violations once they were discovered.

Lynch further suggested that we speak with Chuck Smrt, a former NCAA enforcement staff official whom Ohio State has hired as part of a consulting team to help with its NCAA troubles. Although Smrt is being paid by Ohio State and far from an unbiased source, we decided to hear him out as a well-regarded national expert in the field.

Smrt, a principal with the Compliance Group, said he thinks OSU’s compliance program is one of the tops in the country. ""I don’t think I could ever say that any one school is the best, but I think OSU is in the top five in the country,"" Smrt said.

Smrt said he hasn’t looked at all aspects of OSU’s athletic compliance, but the portions he’s reviewed left him with the impression that OSU has a top-notch compliance department. Smrt also said there were areas he had found where Ohio State could improve its compliance  department but declined to say what they were.

Other experts in athletics compliance were less glowing, but did give OSU’s office good marks. Rick Allen, a former compliance officer for two decades with Illinois and Oklahoma State who sometimes consults on compliance issues with universities, said Ohio State’s department does have a good reputation.

""I’ve long had respect for their compliance office, but whether I’d go so far as to call it a model compliance department, I’d hesitate to do that because I think there are a lot of good ones across the country,"" Allen said.

Allen said that a high number of violations may show a lack of rules education. ""If you’re a school that is reporting a lot of violations, you may have good monitoring procedures, but maybe you need to beef up your rules education a little bit,"" he said.

In fact, OSU Athletics Director Smith blamed inadequate rules education for contributing to the suspensions of six players for selling awards for discounts on tattoos. ""We were not as explicit with our student-athlete education as we should have been in the 2007-08 and 2008-09 academic years regarding the sale of apparel, awards and gifts issued by the athletics department,"" Smith is quoted as saying in a Dec. 23, 2010 release from the NCAA.

Dave Ridpath, an Ohio University professor who worked in the athletics compliance offices for Marshall University and Weber State, said Gee’s comment is an overstatement made for public relations reasons. ""I’m not going to say he’s completely off his rocker, but it’s a statement he should probably never make,"" said Ridpath.

Ridpath said Ohio State has a ""strong"" compliance department, but said it’s ""an impossible situation"" for schools with highly profitable football teams to have a model compliance department.  ""Any school that is at a major level, I don’t think any of them could say they have a model compliance department,"" Ridpath said. ""At schools operating on an Ohio State or SEC level, the most important thing at those schools is winning games, player-eligibility and revenue generation, so compliance is never something pushed to the forefront.""

Beyond the opinions of experts, we reviewed internal audits of the compliance department dating back to 2006 and done in accordance with NCAA rules. Those records show that each year, OSU’s internal auditors found multiple practices in the compliance department that needed improvement. In fact, some of the weaknesses identified by internal auditors were in the same areas where NCAA infractions were later committed by OSU players.

For example, a November 2010 audit found that OSU wasn’t keeping an inventory of awards given to players. The selling of awards by players was the central issue in the tattoos-for-trinkets scandal.

While there is no evidence that the compliance department knew of any violations by the players, the same cannot be said for Ohio State’s most famous employee: Tressel. In March 2011, Ohio State discovered three email strings from a local attorney to Tressel from April and June 2010 informing the coach about players selling awards for discounts on tattoos from a tattoo parlor owner being investigated on federal drug charges. Although he knew that would have made the players ineligible, Tressel never reported what he had learned in the emails to OSU officials. Ohio State has said that is why they fired the popular coach.

Meanwhile, a 2007 audit found that the compliance department wasn’t keeping earning statements of any athletes from part-time jobs and that only 40 percent of the time were employers filling out monitoring paperwork on what jobs athletes were doing. In early October, the overpayment of athletes for part-time jobs was what caused three players to miss the Nebraska game.

Two of the audits also cite continuing problems with athletes not properly registering the cars they were driving with the compliance office — first in 2006 and again in 2010.

Amid the ongoing issues, the university is considering taking compliance away from the athletics department and creating a university-wide compliance department to better improve compliance, according to news reports.  ""We believe we have very sound processes and protocols. Many of them have been validated by third parties as being at or near the best in class,"" OSU Trustee Robert Schottenstein told The Lantern, Ohio State’s student newspaper, for a story. ""Still, as I said, we believe we can get better.""

So what’s our score here?

We haven’t found any experts — including one employed by OSU as a consultant — who describe the university as a poster child for compliance. The experts we interviewed think the compliance department is fairly strong, but not a model for other schools to follow.

Ohio State itself has acknowledged it didn’t properly educate football players several years ago on whether they could sell the awards they were given. And internal audits of athletic compliance departments in recent years show weaknesses cropping up each year, including several areas that have blown up into public infractions for football players during the past year. Additionally, OSU trustees are considering moving the compliance department outside of athletics to improve the program.

In fairness, Gee’s statement was focused on reporting and resolving violations, not necessarily preventing them, even though that’s also the compliance department’s job. And there is no evidence that the compliance office has failed to properly report infractions to the NCAA or cover up anything that has come to light. The NCAA has said it doesn’t see anything that points to a systematic problem in athletics in the recent infractions.

However, the actions of Coach Tressel, a prominent figure with major responsibility in the athletics department, constitute a critical failure in reporting violations -- a failure that cost him his job.

So OSU isn’t exactly ""the poster child for compliance,"" but we’ll give Gee some points for accuracy in describing the university’s commitment to reporting violations. We’ll have to throw a flag for hyperbole, though, and rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AE4B00>],/factchecks/2011/oct/31/e-gordon-gee/ohio-state-university-president-e-gordon-gee-says-/

Jim McGreevey claims he prohibited pay-to-play for state, county contractors
","
Less than two months before leaving office in the wake of a sex scandal, former Gov. Jim McGreevey did more than just talk about the practice of political donors making contributions in exchange for government contracts.

The way he tells it, McGreevey eliminated so-called ""pay-to-play"" on the state and county levels.

""After I had resigned or announced my resignation, I abolished -- I prohibited pay-to-play for people that had county or state contracts,"" McGreevey said during an Oct. 10 interview with Allan Wolper on WBGO.

McGreevey needs to refresh his memory on this one. PolitiFact New Jersey found that the former governor issued an executive order restricting pay-to-play for certain state contracts, but not county contracts.

But even for state contracts, McGreevey’s actions didn’t ""prohibit"" all such donations. Donors could still donate up to $300, and a future governor would address some loopholes in the regulations laid out by McGreevey.

McGreevey told us in an email: ""The Executive Order was, like my radio comment, all too far from perfect. Hopefully, it began to change the terms of the debate in New Jersey. Thanks are due to the efforts of many, who labored for reform and substantially improved the measure.""

First, let’s talk more about this executive order. 
In June 2004, McGreevey signed a pay-to-play bill, criticized at the time for its loopholes. After announcing his resignation that August, McGreevey issued an executive order the following month that imposed tougher restrictions on political donors doing business with the state.

That executive order prohibited awarding state contracts of more than $17,500 to business entities that had made certain donations to various political organizations. The order exempted contracts in response to a public emergency.

Before McGreevey left office in November 2004, the state’s nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services questioned the legality of the executive order, saying it unconstitutionally usurped the Legislature’s authority.

The Legislature and acting Gov. Richard Codey then later turned McGreevey’s pay-to-play reform into a law enacted in March 2005.

But that executive order and the subsequent law did not deal with county contracts, as McGreevey claimed in the radio interview. So he’s wrong on that point.

OK, now McGreevey initiated pay-to-play regulations for state contracts under certain circumstances, but did he ""prohibit"" the practice entirely?

Jeff Brindle, executive director of the New Jersey Election Law Enforcement Commission, told us that wasn’t the case, pointing out how entities with contracts exceeding $17,500 can still donate $300.

""There’s no prohibition,"" Brindle said. ""To prohibit, would be, in my opinion, unconstitutional.""

Heather Taylor, communications director for the Citizens Campaign, an ethics group, said McGreevey prohibited certain contributions, marking ""a real strike at the pay-to-play system.""

But, she added, ""It’s not zero tolerance.""

The law signed by Codey also still had its share of loopholes.

Soon after its enactment, the Star-Ledger reported that a lawyer had drafted a memo explaining how state contractors could get around the law by donating up to $10,000 annually to the Democratic State Committee’s federal campaign fund.

Gov. Jon Corzine closed other loopholes through an executive order in September 2008, which expanded both the definition of a ""business entity"" as well as the list of political organizations receiving contributions.

Still, New Jersey is leading the nation in terms of pay-to-play regulations, according to Craig Holman, a campaign finance lobbyist with Washington, D.C.-based Public Citizen.

""It is one of the strongest pay-to-play laws on the books,"" Holman said. ""It’s quite a good law.""

Our ruling

In a radio interview, McGreevey claimed he ""prohibited pay-to-play for people that had county or state contracts"" after announcing his resignation in August 2004.

McGreevey did issue an executive order, but that only dealt with state contracts. Also, the regulations did not represent a complete prohibition on such political donations, and some loopholes were left in place.

However, since McGreevey put in motion what is considered one of the strongest laws in the nation, we rate the statement Half True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Deficit', 'Pensions', 'State Budget', 'Helen Glover']","
Talk-show host Helen Glover says Rhode Island's pension system is the most poorly-funded in the U.S.
","
(This story was updated on Oct. 31 to reflect the fact that General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has also referred to Rhode Island as ""the worst"" as recently as Sept. 8, 2011.) 
Rhode Island has a pension crisis. Simply put, it doesn't have enough money set aside to cover the payments that it has promised its current and future retirees.

How bad is it? WHJJ talk show host Helen Glover declared on Oct. 24 that we are now first among the worst.

""The State of Rhode Island has the worst state-funded pension in the country. Of all of the systems, we're the worst,"" she said during her Oct. 24 show.

Are we really at the bottom of the heap?

When we asked Glover for her source, she sent along several articles. But before we get to them, a quick reminder about what is at stake.

Rhode Island’s state pension plans are paying $370 million this year to provide retirement benefits for government employees. If nothing changes, that amount will nearly double next year to $615 million.

According to state officials, the plan now has only 48 percent of the funds it needs to cover its pension obligations. The federal government regards 80 percent as a safe level.

Now back to Glover’s claim that Rhode Island’s system is the worst in the nation. One of the sources she supplied to us was a story on WPRI.com with this headline: ""RI pension fund in worst shape of all, Pew suggests.""

But the story compared the 2010 funding level for Rhode Island with Pew data from other states from 2009, when Rhode Island wasn't the worst at all -- five states had less cash in 2009 to cover their pension obligations than Rhode Island (which was at 59 percent). Illinois ranked the worst, funded at 51 percent.

The WPRI story noted what the headline didn't: that it was using data from different years. Yet when other websites picked up the WPRI headline, the story’s caveats were dropped.

Glover's sources included one such item, a five-paragraph story from BusinessInsider.com headlined, ""Rhode Island's Pension Liabilities Are Now The Worst In the Country"" that combined the WPRI story with an error-filled chart that, it said, came from Boston College's Center for Retirement Research.

When we went directly to the Boston College database and ran our own calculations, we found that it put Rhode Island pensions as being funded at 62 percent in 2009, not 48 percent as Business Insider reported. (And instead of being ""the worst in the country,"" Rhode Island was ranked ninth from the bottom, a better ranking than the Pew report.)

So what do the latest numbers show?

At Pew, research director Kil Huh said the organization is still gathering 2010 data. The latest tallies from 4 of the 10-worst states haven't been released.

But Illinois' numbers, published in July, show that state has dropped to a funding level of 45 percent, keeping it at the bottom of the list -- so far. Two states that had worse numbers than Rhode Island in Pew's report on the 2009 numbers -- West Virginia and Oklahoma -- have not released their latest statistics.

So why did the funding percentages fall in 2010?

Huh said it probably comes from the lingering impact of the recession, which keeps pulling down the amount of money pension funds have been earning over the last five years. ""The states are still accounting for the significant losses they experienced in the fall of 2008.""

And in Rhode Island, the state retirement board voted in April to scale back its predicted rate of return for its pension investment portfolio. The assumed rate of return had been 8.25 percent per year; the board adjusted that to 7.5 percent. (The actual market return over the last 10 years has been 5.74 percent; 1.52 percent in the past 5 years.)

Glover also referred us to a recent Washington Post story that paraphrased Raimondo as saying that Rhode Island has the nation’s worst-funded pension system. (We also found a New York Times story that did the same thing.) But neither quoted her directly, and the Post story cited a per-capita comparison, not a funding level comparison.

Raimondo did make such a statement in the Feb. 24, 2011 edition of PBS NewsHour, saying the state had ""the highest unfunded liability per capita of any state in the country.""

But more recently, says Raimondo’s office, the treasurer has consistently characterized the funding level as ""one of the worst"" in the nation or ""one of the worst"" per capita. A search of Providence Journal stories supports that. 
(However, after this report was published, Bob Plain of WPRO produced a tape from Sept. 8, 2011, in which the treasurer clearly and repeatedly characterized the funding of the state's pension system as ""the worst,"" with the ""highest unfunded liability per capita."") 
Our ruling

Helen Glover said Rhode Island's pension system is the mostly poorly funded in the U.S.

Her statement was based on sources that either misread the numbers or mixed old data with new.

Using the latest 2010 numbers from Pew, Rhode Island ranks no lower than second from the bottom, and the state's standing may improve as other states report their figures.

And when we sought out other sources, such as Moody's and Boston College, we couldn't find any ranking that put Rhode Island at the bottom of the barrel when it came to pension funding.

That doesn't detract from Rhode Island's profoundly perilous pension problem.

But being in last place is a very specific distinction, and we're not there -- yet.

Because Glover was so definitive, we rule that her statement ""contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression"" -- PolitiFact's definition of Mostly False.

"['Oregon', 'Kate Brown']","
Kate Brown says state is getting huge return on audit spending
","
It’s always nice to know you’re getting a bang for your tax dollar -- and Oregon Secretary of State Kate Brown wants you to know that you’re getting just that with her Audits Division.

""In 2008, every dollar you gave in performance auditing, we were able to deliver about $8 in cost savings and efficiencies. With our Department of Revenue audit ... in 2010, for every dollar you gave, we've been able to deliver $64 in cost savings and efficiencies,"" Brown said during a speech at the Oregon Summit. ""Now that’s a real return on your performance auditing investment.""

It sure is. Naturally, we couldn’t help but wonder if we were really getting such a good deal.

As usual, we started by going to the source. The Secretary of State’s office sent us a spreadsheet that broke down the 2010 audits and the cost savings they identified.

According to the spreadsheet, the office performed 11 audits last year. In seven of those, the state actually spent more on the audit than it found in potential savings. But the other four helped make up for those.

The biggie was an audit of the Department of Revenue. In that audit, the Secretary of State’s office found 66,000 Oregonians who should have filed state income tax returns in 2007 but as of March 2009, had not. In total, they owed the state some $109 million.

The office figures that if past collection rates on those who don’t file hold true, the state could get some $54 million. Then the office doubled that number. ""We are showing this as one-time impact for the year we reviewed and as an on-going savings, since they would start paying taxes into the future,"" the office notes in the file. ""This number substantially understates potential revenues from earlier tax years which we did not calculate or include which could be collected if (the Department of Revenue)followed our recommendations.""

Basically, an audit that cost the state less than $500,000 wound up yielding more than $100 million in possible cost savings -- and that’s a low estimate.

All this, of course, assumes the Department of Revenue will do what the Secretary of State suggests. Gary Blackmer, the audits director, said he doesn’t have any reason to doubt they will.

""We gave them phone numbers and addresses, it's not like they were just a theoretical number,"" he said.

We called the Department of Revenue to see how the audit shook out on their end. Derrick Gasperini, a spokesman for the department, said the audit had prompted changes in the system. ""As a result of the findings, we were able to make some changes in our practices,"" he said.

But he said he couldn’t say one way or another whether the savings the Secretary of State’s office had predicted were actually realized.

Overall, the Audits Division found some $150 million in savings last year and spent about $2.3 million to find those savings. Divide the former by the latter, and you get nearly $64 in savings for every dollar of auditing.

Now, it should be noted that last year was a pretty stand-out year for the Audits Division in terms of returns -- the best, by far, of the past decade. The year before that, the division found $5 in savings for ever dollar spent. ""For every dollar we spend on audits we shoot for $8 in savings,"" Blackmer said.

The average for the past decade, however, appears to be closer to $18 in savings for every dollar spent.

But back to the ruling statement. Brown said that for every dollar the Secretary of State spent on audits last year, it found $64 in cost savings. Her office has the figures to back this up, and, if anything, it seems like they might be underestimating the total potential savings.

We’ll give this one a True.

"['Deficit', 'Jobs', 'Message Machine 2012', 'Military', 'Virginia', 'Randy Forbes']","
Rep. Randy Forbes says 1.53 million defense jobs are ""at risk""
","
U.S. Rep. Randy Forbes, R-4th, is warning that potential cuts in defense spending would inflict mass destruction on the U.S. economy.

Forbes, whose district is anchored in South Hampton Roads where military installations dominate the economy, unveiled a web ad saying the zeal to cut the nation’s debt has left U.S. defense vulnerable. The commercial says Congress must turn to other programs for savings, or face ""catastrophe. ""

""1.53 million jobs are at risk,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""Pink slips are waiting to be handed out.""

We wondered if 1.53 million defense jobs really are at risk in the latest round of federal budget negotiations. So we decided to take a look.

First, a little background.

After much debate in August, Congress agreed to raise the nation’s debt ceiling in return for long-range budget cuts. The first part of the deal called for reducing overall spending by $900 billion over the next 10 years, including about $400 billion in defense cuts. The defense budget is now about $700 billion a year.

The legislation set up a 12-member, bipartisan super committee of senators and representatives to cut an additional $1.5 trillion in overall spending. If the group fails to reach consensus by Nov. 23, then $1.2 trillion in reductions will automatically occur -- half from defense and half from domestic programs. That cut to defense, combined with the $400 billion in reductions already agreed on, would mean a total loss of $1 trillion in defense money over the next 10 years.

How does Forbes take that figure and compute job losses? Joe Hack, Forbes’ spokesman, pointed us to a comment by Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta in September that a $1 trillion defense cut could add 1 percent to the country’s unemployment rate.

Hack then referred us to Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing the size of the U.S. labor force at about 154 million in September. Cutting 1 percent of that would lead to the loss of 1.53 million jobs, he said.

We ran the numbers ourselves and found Forbes to be accurate.

We came across other estimates that conclude $1 trillion in defense cuts would lead to significant layoffs, although not quite as high as Forbes states.

The Department of Defenses says about 6 million jobs are supported by military spending, including 3.8 million private sector jobs, 700,000 Department of Defense jobs and 1.5 million active-duty service members outside of reserve units.

""Sequestration ($1 trillion in cuts) assumes across the board spending cuts with losses peaking in the 2013-2014 time period, with 1 million to 1.5 million jobs lost and that could increase the U.S. unemployment rate by nearly 1 percentage point in the near term,"" said Lt. Col. Elizabeth Robbins, a spokeswoman of the Department of Defense.

So Forbes’ number is at the top end of what the Department of Defense estimates as far as job losses. It could be as high as 1.5 million but as low as 1 million, according to the Pentagon.

We asked the Defense Department to direct us to any underlying reports showing how they arrived at their numbers for job losses and lower unemployment rate, but they didn’t provide any.

The Aerospace Industries Association, which represents aerospace and defense companies, estimates $1 trillion in defense cuts would cause a loss of slightly more than 1 million jobs. Some layoffs would occur among defense industry contractors and suppliers, but the bulk -- some 653,570 jobs --  would be lost in communities due to the to the loss of payroll spending associated with those jobs, the report states.

The report was authored by Stephen Fuller, director of the Center of Regional Analysis at George Mason University. In a response to questions from Forbes at a October 26 hearing before the House Armed Services Committee, Fuller said his job loss projections don’t include tallies of lost active duty members or civilians employed by the Department of Defense.

In an October 14, 2011 op-ed in the Wall Street Journal, the House Armed Services Committee Chairman, Buck McKeon, R-Calif., said automatic cuts from sequestration ""would kill upwards of 800,000  of our active-duty, civilian and industrial American jobs.""

Claude Schafin, a House Armed Services Committee spokesman, said McKeon’s analysis doesn’t take into account any indirect layoffs in communities that would happen as a result of losses at the Department of Defense and their contractors.

Projections of a 1 percent unemployment spike losses have drawn skepticism from some advocacy groups who charge they’re overblown.

A study by Heidi Garrett-Peltier, a research professor at the University of Massachusetts, concludes the job losses from defense spending would be less than the Department of Defense estimates. Her work was funded by The Institute for Policy Studies, which says it advocates for a U.S. foreign policy based in part on demilitarization.

In an interview Garrett-Peltier said a $1 trillion military cut over 10 years would cost about 860,000 jobs funded either directly or indirectly by the Department of Defense. If you include additional jobs losses in communities from a loss in spending from laid-off employees, the jobs loss would be 1.1 million, she said.

Garrett-Peltier said government spending on defense does not generate as many jobs as investments in health care, education and other areas.

""Are we better off cutting $100 billion in the defense budget or from education, health care, clean energy?"" Garrett-Peltier said. ""We would lose more jobs (from domestic cuts) than cutting $100 billion a year in defense.""

Our ruling:

Forbes, in a web ad, says 1.53 million jobs would be lost if defense cuts hit $1 trillion.

The congressman is clearly presenting a worst-case scenario, basing his figures on a statement by Defense Secretary Leon Panetta. The actual estimate by the Department of Defense -- which Forbes does not note -- is job loss between 1 million and 1.5 million.

Other experts come up with smaller estimates, although their math does not always include all potential layoffs from reduced military -- such as local businesses, active duty members and the like.

We don’t want to minimize the economic impact of $1 trillion in defense cuts. Forbes’ statement on the resulting job loss is credible, but very much on the high side estimates out there. We rate his claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C0E040>],/factchecks/2011/oct/29/randy-forbes/rep-randy-forbes-says-153-million-defense-jobs-are/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Perry wrote an opinion article saying he was open to amnesty for illegal immigrants
","
Assailed by Texas Gov. Rick Perry about undocumented workers who used to mow his lawn, former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney shot back: ""You wrote an op-ed (opinion piece) in the newspaper saying you were open to amnesty"" for illegal immigrants.

That moment at the Oct. 18, 2011, CNN Republican presidential debate marked continued jousting between the two over illegal immigration.

According to a Sept. 11, 2011, news article in the Boston Globe, both hopefuls oppose legislation offering a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants, deeming it ""amnesty."" In references to immigration, according to HG.org, a legal information website, amnesty means a ""governmental pardon for violating policies related to immigration. Immigration amnesty would include the federal government forgiving individuals for using false documentation such as Social Security numbers, identification cards, and driver’s licenses, in order to gain employment in the U.S. and continue to remain in the country. Amnesty would allow illegal immigrants or undocumented aliens to gain permanent residency in the United States.""

The Globe article also notes that Perry unsuccessfully asked the 2011 Texas Legislature to approve legislation disallowing ""sanctuary cities"" in his state and ensuring police officers could inquire into the immigration status of people they stop. The story says too that Perry opposes the federal DREAM Act, which would open a path to citizenship for certain illegal immigrants who complete two years of college or military service.

Republicans haven’t always aligned against amnesty plans. A 1986 measure signed into law by President Ronald Reagan permitted residents illegally in the country before 1982 to work toward legal status. According to a July 2010 report by NPR, nearly 3 million illegal immigrants ultimately took advantage of the opportunity, though critics judged the law a failure at curbing illegal immigration.

These days, Perry ranks among candidates who view amnesty as a toxic term.

A Sept. 12, 2011, press release from his campaign says that Perry ""believes that Washington must first secure the border before we can have any rational discussion about immigration reform, and he opposes amnesty.""

Then again, NumbersUSA, a group that airs concerns about mass immigration, says in a web post updated Sept. 28, 2011, that Perry’s stance on amnesty ""remains unclear. During the (George W.) Bush presidency, Gov. Perry gave mild support to the idea of legalization. But he has spoken against President Obama's various ‘administrative amnesties.’""

That’s a reference to the Obama administration’s declaration it’s applying ""prosecutorial discretion"" to deport some illegal residents and not others. Some factors the government listed in June 2011 as affecting deportations include how long a person has been here, with particular consideration given to his or her legal residency status; if the person came here as a young child; and if he or she has pursued a college degree or served in the military or have immediate relatives who have done so.
   
NumbersUSA also notes Perry’s support for a 2001 Texas law enabling some undocumented residents to pay in-state tuition at colleges and universities. Its entry continues: ""He opposes a congressional-passed amnesty as long as the border is not secure. He says once the border is secure, a conversation about amnesty can start. He does not make it clear where he would stand during such a conversation.""

Back to Romney’s debate jab. Did Perry write a piece saying he was open to amnesty?

Romney spokesman Ryan Williams sent us a copy of a July 28, 2001, letter from Perry, who had become governor the previous year, to the editor of the Dallas Morning News. In the letter, Perry takes exception to a news story characterizing him as wary of easing the flow of immigrants from Mexico into the United States.

That news article, in the July 27, 2001, Morning News, quoted Perry airing reservations about a proposal by the George W. Bush administration to grant permanent legal residency to many undocumented immigrants from Mexico. ""I share the concerns of most Texans and most residents of the United States about an amnesty program,"" the story quoted Perry saying. ""All of those concerns must be addressed in a thoughtful methodical manner.""

The article also referred to President Bush saying he didn’t favor unconditional amnesty for immigrants living here illegally. ""Perry said he, too, sees problems in blanket amnesty but that he supports the goal of working with Mexico on having a seamless border,"" the article said. ""‘Having some day in the future a transparent border is an admirable goal and one we should have,’ (Perry) said. ‘With that said, we realize there are problems with health care, education, environment and infrastructure all along the border of Texas and Mexico that we need to address. Until both countries are comfortable that we addressed these concerns, then we need to be cautious and make progress one step at a time.’""

Perry’s subsequent letter of objection to the newspaper said: ""The truth is, I am intrigued and open to the Bush administration's amnesty proposal. Most Texans would agree that it's better to have legal, taxpaying immigrants from Mexico working in the United States than illegal immigrants living in fear of the law and afraid to access basic services.""

Perry’s letter also said that if Mexico develops a ""stronger middle class, the goal of a more seamless, transparent border could become a reality. In the meantime,"" his letter said, ""...there are many unanswered questions about how an amnesty plan would be implemented and how it would ultimately impact our state's health care and education systems, as well as other services. Any amnesty proposal must be thoroughly debated and analyzed before implementation and should include input from all border states. Such a plan could benefit our state and countless Mexican families seeking a better life. I applaud President Bush for initiating a public dialogue on this important issue and welcome the opportunity to participate in the development of this initiative.""

So, Perry wrote to a newspaper saying he was open to the Bush amnesty proposal, though any proposal would need vetting.

News reports show Perry talking down amnesty in later years.

In a Dec. 14, 2006, article posted on the website of the Texas governor’s office, Perry said ""neither amnesty nor mass deportation is the answer"" to border security and illegal immigration. ""The first unfairly rewards those who broke our laws, and the latter is not only unrealistic and unenforceable, but it would devastate our economy. That’s why I support a guest worker program that takes undocumented workers off the black market and legitimizes their economic contributions without providing them citizenship status.""

His article continues: ""I would rather know who is crossing our border legally to work instead of not knowing who is crossing our border illegally to work. A guest worker program that provides foreign workers with an ID removes the incentive for millions of people to illegally enter our country. It also adds those workers to our tax base, generates revenue for needed social services and it can be done without providing citizenship.""

In his January 2007 inaugural address, Perry said: ""We must have a guest-worker program... And we must oppose amnesty because those who come here illegally should not be able to receive citizenship ahead of those who migrate here legally."" He said much the same in his February 2007 State-of-the-State address, telling lawmakers: ""Those who come here illegally should not be rewarded with amnesty.""

In August 2007, according to a Houston Chronicle news story, Perry said during a trip to Mexico that he supports a system that would temporarily legalize foreign workers, while making sure they pay taxes and obey the law. Such a system, Perry said then, would allow for a ""free flow of individuals between these countries who want to work, who want to be an asset to our country and to Mexico.""

Stumping in Iowa for Rudy Giuliani for president in November 2007, Perry was interrupted when he advocated securing the border and providing non-citizen workers with a tamper-proof ID card, according to a Dallas Morning News recap. In what may have been a reminder that some people see temporary guest-worker schemes as tantamount to amnesty, an audience member said: ""That sounds like amnesty.""

In early 2008, Perry stressed border security over immigration reform in an Austin press conference, saying that if a comprehensive overhaul occurs he wants temporary workers who apply for U.S. citizenship to wait their turn behind others who have already done so. ""There's a line. Get in just like everybody else,"" he said, according to an article in the Feb. 1, 2008, Fort Worth Star-Telegram.

Our ruling 
Romney’s claim leaves the incorrect misimpression Perry is lately open to amnesty, while Perry has said he's against amnesty for years. 
Still, Romney is correct that Perry once wrote a newspaper saying he was open to amnesty, though Perry's 2001 letter spoke only to a particular proposal. The Texan also has aired continued interest in enabling illegal immigrants to become guest workers, an idea that some consider a form of amnesty.

Rachel Maddow says Wall Street fees claim a third of 401(k) values
","On a tirade against Wall Street -- and the critics of Occupy Wall Street protesters -- Rachel Maddow used a ""three pillars"" illustration on her MSNBC show Oct. 19, 2011, to talk about the crumbling of America’s retirement system.

The three pillars of retirement income are pensions, personal savings and Social Security. Then Maddow proceeded to deconstruct how they’ve all been deconstructed.

We were particularly interested in her comments on pensions. Pensions have largely been replaced by 401(k) investment plans, which in Maddow’s view are ""kind of a scam.""

""Whereas pensions for the most part used to be separate from the Wall Street banking/casino apparatus, 401(k) plans just put Wall Street in the middle of the action, right between you and your retirement -- which is by definition a risk-laden venture for the middle class. But it is a great windfall for Wall Street,"" Maddow said. She then went to video of an NBC News segment with Tom Brokaw and a reporter discussing the problem of hidden fees for 401(k) plans. The segment ends with an unidentified male saying, ""The total cost to the American public is something in the neighborhood of $1.5 billion to $2 billion a year."" Maddow then follows up: ""One and a half to $2 billion a year right into Wall Street`s pockets just in fees. And that was back in 1997. What do you think it is now? ""A recent Department of Labor study guessed Wall Street fees cost a worker 28 percent of the value of your plan over the span of your career,"" Maddow said.

That’s a pretty big bite out a hard-earned nest egg. We decided to investigate.

A little on 401(k) plans

Until about 30 years ago, a major source of retirement income for Americans was the employer-funded pension system. Pensions were calculated based on what employees earned and years of service. Traditional pensions are known as a defined benefit plans because they pay a fixed amount every month.

Many employers no longer offer pensions because, quite simply, they’re expensive. Instead, more and more are offering 401(k) plans. In these defined contribution plans, the employee contributes to an individual fund -- a contribution sometimes matched by the employer. Instead of providing a predictable income in retirement, the plans are subject to the ups and downs of the market and other variables that can erode or enhance retirement income, including how many years the money is invested and the timing of withdrawals.

Most of us don’t manage our plans ourselves -- they demand sophisticated, long-term investment decisions -- so that’s where management companies come in. Think Vanguard and Fidelity and other investment advisers. Maddow was talking about the fees charged by these firms to manage the plans’ investments and do the bookkeeping.

What we found

A spokesman for MSNBC referred us to a section of the Department of Labor website that covers these fees.

""Assume that you are an employee with 35 years until retirement and a current 401(k) account balance of $25,000. If returns on investments in your account over the next 35 years average 7 percent and fees and expenses reduce your average returns by 0.5 percent, your account balance will grow to $227,000 at retirement, even if there are no further contributions to your account. If fees and expenses are 1.5 percent, however, your account balance will grow to only $163,000. The 1 percent difference in fees and expenses would reduce your account balance at retirement by 28 percent,"" the website says.

To Maddow, that paragraph meant Wall Street takes nearly a third of workers’ retirement savings.

We asked a couple of economists what it meant to them.

Steve Utkus, a principal with the Vanguard Center for Retirement Research, said the Labor Department’s example is ""a standard hypothetical used through the retirement savings industry.""

""It simply says that, all things equal, higher fees mean lower savings at retirement. ... I don't believe the DOL was trying to make any comparison with the actual fees paid by 401(k) plans -- for example, that most participants were paying one or the other fee,"" Utkus said.

He pointed us to a 2009 study by Deloitte Consulting and the Investment Company Institute, a trade group for mutual funds, that surveyed actual fees paid by plans. It found the median 401(k) fee is 0.72 percent -- or about half the 1.5 percent used in the Labor department example.

Utkus also pointed out that most participants in the U.S. (i.e. employers) are larger plans which are able to negotiate even lower fees.

Tony Webb, senior economist with the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, also noted that assuming 7 percent return on investment is a bit optimistic. Taking inflation into account, Webb said a return of 4.5 percent is more realistic. And 35 years, he said, is longer than most people save for retirement. They may have student loans to pay when they begin working, or they might put their extra money toward saving for a house. Whatever the reasons, Webb said most people don’t get serious about saving until age 40.

So that 35-year retirement savings could be shortened to 25 years and both the fees and the return on investment could be significantly lower.

The Labor department example assumes a single contribution accruing interest over time. Webb said it’s more useful to consider a worker who makes annual contributions.

He says, ""A typical worker aged 27, earning $50,000 a year, who contributed 9 percent of salary (6 percent himself plus a 50 percent employer match), invested 50/50 in a stock-bond portfolio earning 4.5 percent after inflation, could, in the absence of fees, expect to accumulate $366,700 by age 62. If he incurred fees of 0.72 percent, his pot would be 13.5 percent less, $317,200.""

Webb also pointed out that the fees aren’t for nothing. ""Investment managers do provide a service,"" he said.

Still, the reason all this is important -- the reason the Labor Department devotes space to it on its website and the reason Maddow sounded the alarm -- is that the fees over time do add up to thousands of dollars subtracted from people’s savings.

And yet very often they’re invisible.

""There’s nothing on the (401(k) plan) website that tells you how much the plan manager has charged you that month in management fees,"" Webb said. ""Nobody sends you a bill.""

So those fees just end up being unknown costs that erode substantial value out of people’s nest eggs. (Some good news on that front: new regulations that take effect next year will require companies to provide investors more and clearer information in their quarterly statements on administrative and investment fees charged to their accounts.)

Our ruling

Maddow declared, ""a recent Department of Labor study guessed Wall Street fees cost a worker 28 percent of the value of your plan over the span of your career."" But what she was quoting was not a study -- but a scenario using higher than normal fees.

Maddow's statement made it sound as if the typical worker, or at least a great many of us, lose a third of our retirement savings to plan management fees. Economists tell us that’s not the case.

So Maddow correctly reflected the Labor Department's hypothetical scenario in which fees would seriously erode retirement savings. But it didn't reflect the reality most workers with retirement savings accounts face. In reality, returns on investment, the number of years the money is invested and even the fees vary greatly. The study by Deloitte Consulting and the Investment Company Institute that surveyed actual fees paid by plans found the median 401(k) fee is 0.72 percent -- or about half of the rate used in the Labor Department's example.

We take Maddow’s larger point -- that these unseen fees can claim a lot of money from people who don’t have it to spare. But the numbers that she uses to make the point reflect higher fees than most people pay. So we rate her claim Mostly False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809757E2C0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/28/rachel-maddow/rachel-maddow-says-wall-street-fees-claim-third-40/

Supercommittee co-chair Jeb Hensarling cites huge spending increases in four agencies
","
Editor’s note: We originally published a ruling on this claim on Oct. 27, 2011, rating it False. After the story came out, Hensarling’s office -- which hadn’t gotten back to us by publication time -- contacted us to provide the data they were working from, and we promised to re-evaluate the claim based on the newly provided data. We’ve rewritten the article below, republishing it Oct. 28, keeping the rating the same. Our original article is archived here.

***

During an Oct. 26, 2011, hearing of the congressional Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction -- the ""supercommittee"" that’s charged with making steep cuts in the federal budget -- the co-chairman, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, offered budgetary statistics designed to show massive spending increases by federal agencies in recent years.
   
Here’s a portion of the back-and-forth between Hensarling and Douglas Elmendorf, director of the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan arm of Congress that analyzes budget and fiscal matters.
   
Hensarling: ""Is it not true that the stimulus bill, with interest, amounts to over a $1 trillion of spending, which accounts for a large temporary growth in our discretionary budget?""
   
Elmendorf: ""Yes, although, as you know, congressman, only a part of the Recovery Act was about discretionary spending. There were also increases in mandatory spending and reductions in taxes. In total we put it a little over $800 billion, and including interest I think you're right about a trillion. And it did lead to a bulge in discretionary funding and then to … an attenuated bulge in outlays because not all of the money got spent right away.""
   
Hensarling: ""I don't know if you have at your fingertips numbers with respect to agency growth. I had quoted a few, and now that I look down, apparently the source is your office, so I hope I'm quoting your office correctly.""
   
Elmendorf: ""I don't have those at hand, congressman, but ... if they're numbers from us, then you can certainly trust those!"" (Laughter in the hearing room.)
   
Hensarling: ""I can trust them. Well, then I trust that when you add in the stimulus, the Commerce Department has grown 219 percent from '08 to '10, that with the stimulus, EPA has grown 130.8 percent. The Energy Department has grown 170.7 percent with the stimulus. Education has grown 180.6 percent at a time when the economy has actually seen negative economic growth and family paychecks have shrunk.""
   
When this exchange got picked up in a Fox News Web article, a reader saw it and asked us whether Hensarling’s numbers were accurate. So we took a look.

After we published our original analysis of this comment on Oct. 27, 2011, Hensarling’s staff got back to us, sending the table he was working from as he conducted the exchange with Elmendorf. The table is drawn from CBO data but compiled by the House Budget Committee Republican staff.

It shows department-by-department breakdowns of discretionary budget authority between 2008 and 2011. What does ""discretionary budget authority"" mean? Simply put, it’s the amount of money that Congress, in a given year, has agreed to allow a department to spend -- but it may be spread over multiple years. It’s not the same as actually spending the money in that year. The latter is known as ""outlays"" -- a distinction that becomes important to our analysis. But to keep things simple, we’ll just look at discretionary budget authority for now.

Here’s a stripped-down version of Hensarling’s table; the full version is accessible here. All amounts are rounded and in billions of dollars. 
As Hensarling stated at the hearing, he was adding together the 2010 authority and the stimulus amount to arrive at his percentage increase. And using that method, the numbers do work out. But is it a fair method to use? We have a few problems with it.

Hensarling combines several years of stimulus spending into a single year, exaggerating the actual amount of budgetary growth between 2008 and 2010.

Lumping all of the budget authority from the stimulus into one year makes the final year of his two-year comparison higher, even if the stimulus money was actually spent over multiple years. This juices the percentage increases he cited at the hearing.

As we noted, there’s a difference between a department being granted discretionary budget authority in a given year and actually spending the money in that year. Not only may the agency face logistical hurdles in spending the money, but in some cases the money was never expected, or intended, to be spent during the same year the authority was granted.

That’s where the alternate concept of ""outlays"" comes in. Outlays measure how much money actually goes out the department’s door in a given year. Here are the OMB outlay figures for 2008 to 2010.

Commerce: Up 71 percent (compared to Hensarling’s 219 percent)
Education: Up 41 percent (compared to Hensarling’s 181 percent)
Energy: Up 44 percent (compared to Hensarling’s 171 percent)
EPA: Up 39 percent (compared to Hensarling’s 131 percent)

It’s clear that for every department cited, Hensarling’s percentage increase is three to four times higher than what the figure would be for actual outlays. Even if you consider both methodologies to be equally valid -- which we’re not convinced of -- Hensarling has essentially cherry-picked a much higher figure for the percentage increase that doesn't represent real spending.

Also, to be strictly accurate, the budget authority from the stimulus should have been assigned to the year the bill passed -- 2009 -- which would have lowered his numbers, not 2010, as Hensarling has chosen to do. The fluid nature of how stimulus monies began flowing make this issue somewhat complicated, but choosing to add it to 2010 is one additional factor that jacks up the amount of spending in the latter year of Hensarling’s comparison.

Hensarling leaves out that stimulus spending was always supposed to be temporary.

Hensarling is guilty of cherry-picking for another reason: The stimulus was designed to be temporary.

Someone hearing Hensarling’s figures might assume that the large increases he cited would continue into the future, when in fact departmental budgets were designed to return to a more historically ""normal"" level by 2011 and beyond.

This becomes apparent from the column in Hensarling’s own chart titled ""base budget growth, 2008-2010."" ""Base budget growth"" is the amount of growth to the department’s budget minus the stimulus. Its pattern is closer to the department’s long-term spending arc.

These numbers, while rising, are much more modest than the figures Hensarling cites -- an 11 percent increase for Education, a 10 percent increase for Energy and a 35 percent increase for EPA. (Commerce’s figure was significantly higher, but we’ll explain why in a moment.)

To be fair, focusing on base budget growth when there’s an elephant in the room -- the stimulus -- isn’t appropriate either. But we think the most accurate way to chart the growth in departmental spending is to show separately how much comes from base growth and how much comes from temporary stimulus. Yet Hensarling focused only on a combination of the two -- a much more dramatic number.

""It is a little disingenuous to infer the stimulus bulge as the baseline increase in agency budgets,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that analyzes federal spending.
   
Ellis added that he’s heard Democrats doing the opposite. ""You often find Democrats complaining about draconian cuts from 2009 to 2011, using the same bulge in the other direction,"" he said.

The Commerce Department figures are skewed by a different temporary bump -- from the 2010 Census.

Every 10 years, the Commerce Department undertakes a national census. As a result, spending by the department in any year divisible by 10 is much higher than it is for the rest of the decade. That skews the Commerce Department number for 2010 -- the final year of the time frame Hensarling cited, thus contributing to Commerce’s supposed chart-topping increase of 219 percent.

Aides speaking for Hensarling acknowledged the Census bump. They also addressed the other two concerns we listed above.

On why they used budget authority rather than outlays -- effectively lumping all stimulus spending into 2010 even if the money was spent in a different year -- Jonathan Burks, policy director at the House Budget Committee, said that Hensarling was speaking as a member of Congress, and Congress can only control how much budget authority is granted, not how fast departments ultimately spend the money they are permitted to spend.

As for why Hensarling used the stimulus-enhanced numbers for the 2010 figure, Burks acknowledged that ""you can look at the numbers a lot of different ways, but the fair way to do it is to look at the amount of budgetary resources available to agencies during the first two years of Democratic control"" of Congress and the White House.

He also expressed skepticism about how temporary the stimulus will ultimately prove to be. He said that the White House may have sold the stimulus as a temporary measure, but it’s now coming back with an American Jobs Act that looks a lot like a stimulus bill.

Our ruling

We understand the arguments behind Hensarling’s methodological choices, but we still believe the path he chose cherry-picked the highest possible increase that the numbers would allow -- one several times higher than other ways to measure the same figure.

He lumped all stimulus spending into a single year, even though the spending was spread over several years. The year he chose to assign the stimulus spending to -- 2010 -- was not even the year the budget authority had been granted. And he obscured the fact that much of the enormous increases he cited stemmed from temporary factors, whether it’s the stimulus or spending on the decennial Census.

"['Wisconsin', 'Bloggers']","
Bloggers say Gov. Scott Walker is taking a pay raise while freezing salaries for state employees
","
The reaction to Gov. Scott Walker’s state employee pay plan, which calls for no pay raises for state workers for the next two years, fell along party lines.

Republicans said it was a measure of continued tough economic times and tight budgets. Democrats and union leaders complained the pay freeze came on the heels of legislation passed by Walker and the GOP-controlled Legislature that requires state workers to pay more for the health insurance and pensions.

Some left-wing bloggers found even more reason for outrage.

They said that while the average state worker was being hit again, others -- including Walker -- weren’t sharing the pain.

Of course, Walker is the guy who as Milwaukee County executive liked to tout the fact he was giving back some of his salary. And as governor likes to note he’s so frugal he brings a brown bag lunch to work. Nothing stirs up bloggers quite like the smell of hypocrisy in the morning.

The Cognitive Dissidence blog said this:

""It is noted that Walker is giving himself a $7,500 raise. Not only is he being overly generous to himself, but he is also lavishing the love on some of his top henchmen like Becky Kleefisch, J.B. Van Hollen and Mike Huebsch.""

Another blog, Uppity Wisconsin, made a similar claim, saying Walker ""clearly thinks the hard-working, ultra-efficient, super-effective guy who's Wisconsin governor (that would be him, as defined by him) deserves a significant pay raise -- a 5.4 percent raise.""

There were more examples, as the claim was picked up by other bloggers. Some reporters even contacted the governor’s office to ask about the issue. Residents called the governor’s office to register their complaints. And we received numerous emails -- from both sides -- urging us to sort it out.

So did the governor’s compensation plan -- scheduled to take effect in January -- pad his own salary?

Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie said the state’s largest employee’s union was to blame for spreading the misinformation. Marty Beil, executive director of the Wisconsin State Employees Union, AFSCME Council 24, issued a news release Oct. 28, 2011 that criticized Walker for taking a higher salary than his predecessor -- but that was after the blog posts and the initial outrage.

So we’ll focus on the bloggers’ pay raise claims.

The bloggers all cite this 184-page document which outlines Walker’s overall compensation plan for state workers. It includes a chart (page 67) showing the salaries for the state’s constitutional officers, such as state treasurer, secretary of state, attorney general and, of course, governor.

For each, an ""incumbent’s salary"" as of July 5, 2009, is shown, with a line through it and another line shows the new pay rate as of Jan. 1, 2012.

In the case of the governor, the salary of $137,092 is shown with a line through it. The salary to take effect next year is listed as $144,423.

A raise, right?

That’s how the bloggers interpreted the chart.

But that’s not how pay for elected officials is set. The state constitution bars elected officials from increasing their own pay. That’s why changes are set before elections and always take effect in the future, when the new officials are in place.

So, Walker’s pay was determined before Walker ever took office, according to state Legislative Reference Bureau.

Indeed, the higher salaries were proposed by Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle’s administration and approved by state lawmakers back in 2008. Under that measure, Walker is already being paid $144,423 and that salary will remain in effect -- with no change -- during the four-year term. The other constitutional officers will also receive flat pay.

So what of the chart that the bloggers referenced?

""We’ve been getting a lot of confusion on this,"" said Tim Lundquist, a communications officer for the state Department of Administration, who pointed to the Office of State Employment Relations.

""The OSER people say this is the way it has to be drafted,’"" Lundquist said.

Greg Gracz, head of the employment relations office, tried to clarify matters with a memo Oct. 27 that said: ""No increases for rates for office for constitutional officers are proposed.""

But his attempt with a chart to clear up the matter is equally misleading -- and incorrect.

That new chart shows the governor’s pay under a column titled ""effective July 5, 2009"" as $144,423. It shows the same pay under another column, effective Jan. 1, 2012. That suggests to the average reader (or blogger) that Gov. Jim Doyle was paid that amount. He wasn’t. The pay raise took effect when Walker took office.

Our conclusion

Bloggers dug into the pay plan proposed by Walker and found what sure looked like the ultimate hypocrisy: the governor giving himself a raise while freezing state workers pay for two years.

The document they cited makes it look like there’s a raise coming, but there is not. Elected officials cannot increase their own pay. A quick look at the Blue Book or a phone call to the Legislative Reference Bureau would have told them that. So there’s no pay raise for Walker, or the lieutenant governor, state treasurer, secretary of state, and attorney general.

Although the confusion is understandable because of a sloppy and confusing state compensation document (and an equally poor followup memo), it muddles things for residents.

Here’s the clearest answer possible: The claim is False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C003640>],/factchecks/2011/oct/28/blog-posting/bloggers-say-gov-scott-walker-taking-pay-raise-whi/

Chain e-mail claims Obama is first president to ""terminate America’s ability to put a man in space""
","
A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail critical of President Barack Obama that’s been making the rounds. It’s headlined, ""Barack Obama's 32 Month Report Card.""

""Mr. Hope and Change wants to create a nation humbled; humiliated, casting-aside capitalism and individual freedoms for one where ‘we the people’ are government controlled,"" says the chain e-mail, which is attributed to a Rich Carroll. ""This would be a system that genuflects mediocrity, steals personal aspiration and opportunity, and punishes those who strive to succeed.""

The e-mail proceeds to offer roughly three dozen ""firsts"" about Obama, all of them highly unflattering.

We can’t check each and every claim in the e-mail, but we decided instead to spot-check a few claims we hadn’t seen before. (Here’s the full text of the e-mail we received.)

The one we’ll check here is that Obama is the ""First President to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space.""

On July 21, 2011, space shuttle Atlantis arrived at its home port, NASA's Kennedy Space Center in Florida, concluding the last-ever shuttle mission. With the end of the space shuttle program, it’s correct that the United States no longer has the ability to send an astronaut into space by a domestic launch.

The hope is that commercial companies based in the U.S. will be ready to launch by 2016, if Congress provides NASA with adequate funding, said Marcia Smith of spacepolicyonline.com. NASA's own system is not likely to be ready until at least 2020, though that might be accelerated by a couple of years at most, she said.

So, for at least five years, the United States will not be able to send astronauts into orbit. In the interim, American astronauts are slated to blast off on Russian spacecraft, according to what NASA told PolitiFact Texas the last time we checked this issue. Unlike the reusable space shuttles, the Russian crafts -- which are launched from a base in Kazakhstan -- are disposable.

So the chain e-mail contains a grain of truth that the U.S. no longer has the ""ability to put a man in space"" -- at least from American soil. (The author of the e-mail would have been more accurate if he'd made clear that we’re unable to do domestic launches specifically.)

Still, containing that grain of truth doesn’t mean the e-mail’s claim is correct. Initially, we focused on the question of whether it was fair to blame Obama singlehandedly for the current state of affairs for U.S. manned launches. Knowing how long it takes space programs to come to fruition, we were skeptical that it Obama deserved all the blame.

When we contacted space experts for their view, they agreed that it would be unfair to blame only Obama.

""President George W. Bush directed NASA to shut down the shuttle program, with full knowledge that there would be a multi-year gap for human spaceflight,"" said Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""Although President Obama could have tried to reverse that directive, he opted instead to promote the near-term development of U.S. commercial capabilities for transportation to and from low-earth orbit (which includes the International space station) and, in the longer term, to develop a heavy-lift NASA-operated launch system for exploration missions beyond low-earth orbit.""

So Ellegood sees several problems with the chain e-mail’s claim. Obama did not terminate the shuttle capability -- rather, the timing was set in motion by his predecessor, Bush. And once in office, Obama added two shuttle missions in order to reduce the duration of the gap and also worked to get the shuttle’s commercial-based replacement lined up.

But there’s another fact that’s even more damning to the e-mail’s claim: Having a gap in U.S. space flights carrying astronauts actually happened once before, making the claim completely untrue.

The United States had no ability to launch astronauts into space from 1975 -- the year of the Apollo Soyuz Test Project -- until 1981, when the space shuttle program went live.

""One could blame (President Richard) Nixon, who ended Apollo and approved the shuttle, or (President Gerald) Ford, who didn't disagree with Nixon, though by 1974 it might have been too late to rescue Apollo,"" Smith said. ""Usually it's Nixon who is ‘blamed’ for that. By the time Carter came into office, Apollo had already ended and shuttle couldn't be accelerated. It actually was supposed to be ready by 1979, but NASA couldn't pull it off.""

That the author of the e-mail made this charge against Obama is evidence that ""no one really noticed the original gap at the time, or remembers it today, even though it was a six-year gap,"" Smith said.

Our ruling

Whether one wants to blame Bush or Obama for our current predicament turns out to be irrelevant to the question raised in the e-mail. Richard Nixon, perhaps in conjunction with Gerald Ford, would be the one to qualify for the unwanted title of ""first president to terminate America’s ability to put a man in space"" -- not Obama. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097043040>],/factchecks/2011/oct/28/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-obama-first-president-terminat/

Gov. Rick Scott says toll roads sped up traffic on I-95 for those who didn't pay
","
Florida Gov. Rick Scott, a big fan of interviews from friendly talk radio stations, used an Oct. 10, 2011, chat with a Daytona Beach host to discuss prudent investments for the state amid another big budget shortfall.

(Well, after saying Florida doesn't need more anthropologists, which created an uproar within the academic community. And after disputing that he's changed how he will measure his promise to create 700,000 private-sector jobs, which PolitiFact Florida gave a full-flop. Moving on ...)

Scott pointed to improving state ports in anticipation of the Panama Canal expansion, cargo rail and adding more toll roads across the state to support new construction projects. In his comments to host Marc Bernier, Scott said the state can designate toll lanes on federal highways as long as the state adds a new lane, and he cited changes to Interstate 95 as an example of how it can work well.

""We did that down in Broward County,"" he said. ""It took the rush-hour traffic for the non-tolled lanes from 25 mph to 45 (mph). So for people not paying the toll it was a big benefit. We're going to start doing that across the state.""

Scott's claim that express lanes improved rush-hour traffic for all drivers is interesting, especially given his signal that he wants to expand tolling statewide. He repeated the point a week later in an interview on Tampa Bay's WFLA-AM 970. We thought it wise to check his evidence.

95 Express, a primer

First we'll address what he's talking about, as it may not be obvious to residents outside of southeast Florida with its notoriously treacherous commutes. Scott was referring to ""95 Express,"" a Florida Department of Transportation project unveiled in December 2008 to improve traffic speeds during the morning and afternoon rush hour.

He misspoke when he said the program was in Broward County. The only operational piece of the project is in Miami-Dade County.

DOT workers added new lanes to a 7.3-mile stretch of I-95 by repainting northbound and, about a year later, southbound lane lines. The express lanes replaced High Occupancy Vehicle, or HOV, lanes that were reserved for cars carrying two or more people, free of charge. The HOV lanes -- one in each direction -- were not very popular.
 
The special toll lanes, two in each direction, start at State Road 836, called the Dolphin Expressway, in Miami, and run north to the Golden Glades Interchange. The second phase, which was scheduled to begin construction in fall 2011, will extend from Golden Glades to Fort Lauderdale in Broward County.

A word about the tolls: They are paid automatically via electronic transponders (SunPass) but are not charged to motorcycles, registered carpools of three or more passengers, registered hybrid vehicles, and school and transit buses. Anyone else itching to use the lane less traveled pays a fee based on ""congestion pricing,"" meaning the toll value changes with traffic load. The rate increases with demand, so drivers pay more to use the express lane when they need it most. The higher the toll, the busier the lanes.

DOT keeps a weekly estimate of these rates. From Oct. 3 to Oct. 7, 2011, the toll in both lanes was 25 cents from midnight to 7 a.m. But in the southbound lane, which takes on a heavier load of morning commuters, the fee got as high as $3. Conversely, the fee peaked at $2.75 in the northbound lanes from 5 to 6 p.m.

""They opt to pay the toll because they know they're going to have a more reliable trip,"" said Brian Rick, DOT District Six spokesman.

The program has generated about $28 million since its debut, he said, or about $1 million a month. That money pays for maintenance of the program and express buses that use the lanes. The first phase of construction cost about $132 million, according to the first yearly overview of the program. The second phase reaching Fort Lauderdale will cost an expected $92.7 million and be finished by 2014.

The express lanes reached their peak toll of $7.10 when fans piled on the highway after an Oct. 4, 2010, Miami Dolphins-New England Patriots game. That's a pretty steep fare at $1 per mile, earning the express lanes the nickname ""Lexus lanes.""

Benefits

Scott is right: converting high-occupancy vehicle lanes to express lanes speeds up traffic, the program overview shows.

Traffic in both HOV and general lanes crawled below 20 mph during the morning and afternoon rush, according to a 2008 study of the HOV lanes. With the express lanes, southbound traffic in non-toll lanes jumped to an average 51 mph during morning rush hour, a 35.7 mph leap. In the northbound non-toll lanes during the afternoon rush, traffic sped up to 41.3 mph, improving by 22.5 mph.

DOT puts it more simply on its website: ""With the opening of the express lanes, drivers are experiencing improved speeds above 40 MPH in the local lanes and 50 MPH in the express lanes along the northbound and southbound directions during rush hour periods.""

A few caveats about DOT's numbers. The 2008 HOV study relied on peak periods of 7 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 6 p.m. In its evaluation of average speeds with 95 Express, DOT expanded the rush-hour periods by an additional hour from 6 to 9 a.m. and 4 to 7 p.m. Also, the southbound toll lanes did not open until Jan. 15, 2010, halfway through the 2009-10 fiscal year during which DOT collected its speed data for both lanes.

There's also the number of vehicles using the highway to consider. The program improved peak-period speeds, but did it do the same for volume?

The southbound section in 2008 took on an average of 6,872 vehicles in the HOV and general purpose lanes per hour during the morning peak period. In the northbound section, the 2008 hourly peak period figure was 7,843. In 2010 (keeping in mind the caveats we mentioned before) the southbound express and general purpose lanes moved a total of about 8,916 vehicles per morning rush hour, and 7,856 vehicles per hour in the northbound section in the afternoon.

DOT has not completed its fiscal year 2011 report, but project manager Rory Santana said volume is improving as peak-period speeds stay the same.

In an interview, he acknowledged the argument that traffic would have improved simply because DOT created a new lane. Still, he says, if DOT had just added an extra lane without the toll lanes and congestion pricing, ""there's a very good chance that volume would have gone up right there and filled it up,"" Santana said.

Scott and DOT Secretary Ananth Prasad want to expand the managed lanes program across the state. Prasad is seeking a public-private partnership to put new Express-style lanes on I-75 in Broward County, as well as adding a managed lane to Miami's Palmetto Expressway, according to an interview with the News Service of Florida.

Our ruling

A program overview for 95 Express shows Gov. Scott was about right when he said speeds for rush-hour traffic in non-toll lanes had improved from 25 mph to 45 mph. DOT's first study of the program shows traffic speeds during the peak periods were actually lower than 20 mph before the program. In 2010,  traffic speeds during peak periods increased by 35 mph for southbound general lanes and by 22.5 mph in northbound general lanes. Still, Scott misidentified the program's location.

"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Gingrich claims health care reform includes 'Death Panels'
","Former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich seems to have done some dumpster diving in that bin where politicians toss their old rhetoric.

During the Republican primary debate in New Hampshire, Gingrich reused an old gem of a claim: That President Barack Obama’s health care reform created ""Death Panels.""

Karen Tumulty, a national political correspondent for the Washington Post, brought up expensive treatment that she said patients receive in the last two years of their lives under Medicare. She asked the former Georgia congressman whether such spending is wasteful, and if the government should intervene.

""So, if you ask me, ‘Do I want some Washington bureaucrat to create a class action decision which affects every American’s last two years of life?’  Not ever,"" Gingrich replied.

""I think it is a disaster. I think, candidly, Governor Palin got attacked unfairly for describing what would, in effect, be death panels,"" he said.

Death panels?

Our friends at PolitiFact National, our sister site based in Washington, D.C., debunked the ""Death Panel"" claim more than two years ago. In fact, it was PolitiFact’s 2009 Lie of the Year.

Since Gingrich seems it’s worthwhile to recycle death panels, we think it’s worthwhile to remind readers why they’re bunk.

PolitiFact National traced the controversy to a post on Palin’s Facebook page Aug. 7, 2009. She said seniors and the disabled ""will have to stand in front of Obama's 'death panel' so his bureaucrats can decide, based on a subjective judgment of their 'level of productivity in society,' whether they are worthy of health care.""

PolitiFact read all 1,000 pages of the Democratic bill and examined versions in various committees.

""There is no panel in any version of the health care bills in Congress that judges a person's ‘level of productivity in society’ to determine whether they are ‘worthy’ of health care,"" they concluded.

""There's certainly no ""death board"" that determines the worthiness of individuals to receive care,"" they added.

Health care bill opponents could make a case that Palin is justified in fearing that the current reform could one day transform into such a board, but that’s not what she said. She said the panels were in the bill. They weren’t, and they still aren’t.

PolitiFact also debunked a similar claim made after the final version of the health care bill passed in March 2010.

In June of that year, PolitiFact Florida looked at a claim by a candidate for U.S. Congress that under the new health care law, the elderly will be denied care when they have ""passed the age limit for treatment.""

The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees Medicare, the federal health care program for the elderly, confirmed in an email that it has no age limit for treatment.

This newer claim started because the health care law, as passed, does support ""comparative effectiveness research,"" which compares the clinical effectiveness of treatments.

But the law specifies that if research shows a certain treatment for the elderly isn't effective, it ""may not be construed as mandates, guidelines, or recommendations for payment, coverage, or treatment or used to deny coverage.""

""Death panels"" were not proposed when the health care reform effort started, and ""death panels"" still don’t exist.  Gingrich earns a Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1484bcdb-41e1-4486-a690-13eb89d7e7e0",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C88DC0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/28/newt-gingrich/gingrich-claims-health-care-reform-includes-death-/

Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel touts investment pool's credit rating
","
Critics of Republican Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel describe him as an overly ambitious politician who focuses on his next election rather than his current job.

This gripe has grown louder as Mandel, elected treasurer last November, recently emerged as a candidate for U.S. Senate to oppose incumbent Democrat Sherrod Brown, who is up for re-election next year.

While he campaigns for the Senate race, Mandel has promoted his work as state treasurer, whose responsibilities are to safeguard and invest the state’s money.

The treasurer also invests money for local governments through the STAR (State Treasury Asset Reserve) Ohio fund, an investment pool with assets of more than $4.1 billion.

Mandel, a former Lyndhurst City Councilman, touted the fund’s credit rating in an email to supporters in early October. The STAR Ohio fund ""just received the highest possible credit rating one of these funds can receive,"" he wrote in the Oct. 5 email.

Mandel went on to praise his staff for making tough decisions in the midst of an unpredictable economy. He also contrasted the fund’s performance against the recent downgrade of the United States’ credit rating.

Given his Senate candidacy and the consistent accusations he is an absent officeholder, PolitiFact Ohio decided to check Mandel’s claim about his performance as treasurer.

The treasurer’s office directed us to its news release on Sept. 8. The release included a letter from the credit rating agency Standard & Poor’s, along with recent news stories about local government investment funds. Like other credit rating agencies, S&P analyzes the creditworthiness of various governments, government-backed funds and other investments.

On Aug. 23, S&P sent a letter to the state affirming a AAAm rating for the STAR Ohio fund.

Unfamiliar with the lower-case ""m"" attached to the rating, we looked it up under S&P’s ratings definitions.

The ""m"" subscript signifies a money market fund rating, which assesses the fund’s ability to maintain a stable net asset value. AAAm is the highest of these ratings.

""Higher rated funds are expected to have stronger capacities to pay investor redemptions in cash during times of high market stress because they generally comprise shorter maturity and higher quality investments,"" according to S&P.

Mandel is accurate in saying the fund received the highest possible rating. He also told supporters the fund ""just"" received the rating, so we wanted to check whether the rating was upgraded under Mandel, or if the fund maintained a high rating established under previous treasurers. 

Jeff Sexton, a spokesman for S&P, said STAR Ohio has received a AAAm rating since 1995, the first year S&P rated the fund.

Although Mandel has simply maintained the high rating, a public finance expert said the treasurer deserves some credit. The highest praise, however, should be reserved for the fund managers who maintained the rating during the financial crisis in 2008, said Kevin O’Brien, executive director at the Center for Public Management in the Maxine Goodman Levin College of Urban Affairs at Cleveland State University.

""He deserves credit for maintaining that (rating) from January until now,"" said O’Brien, a former financial analyst for Moody’s Investors Service, another credit rating agency. ""They maintained the bond rating; they didn't achieve the bond rating.""

We checked with Mandel’s office to get an idea of how the STAR Ohio fund is managed. Spokesman Seth Unger said the office’s investment department works with financial advisers to manage the fund. Unger said investments are bought and sold daily.

The STAR Ohio fund did, in fact, receive the highest rating possible, as Mandel’s email claimed. But the rating already had been in place for 16 years. It did not improve under Mandel, as a reasonable person might assume from his email. And while he gets some credit for maintaining the rating, his email overstated the case. 

Those are important details that add context. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096953680>],/factchecks/2011/oct/27/josh-mandel/ohio-treasurer-josh-mandel-touts-investment-pools-/

Medicare premiums going up due to “Obamacare”? Chain e-mail gets it wrong
","
A chain e-mail going around warns of a Medicare premium increase, saying monthly premiums will go up from $96.40 to $247 in 2014. Blame it all on ""Obamacare,"" the e-mail says.

Here’s the full text of the copy we received:

MEDICARE PREMIUM INCREASE

For those of you who are on Medicare, read the article below. It's a
short but important article that you probably haven't heard about in
the mainstream news:

The per person Medicare insurance premium will increase from the
present monthly fee of

$  96.40, rising to:

$104.20 in 2012;

$120.20 in 2013;  And

$247.00 in 2014.

These are provisions incorporated in the Obamacare legislation,
purposely delayed so as not to 'confuse' the 2012 re-election
campaigns.

Send this to all seniors that you know, so they will know who's
throwing them under the bus.

We decided to fact-check this chain e-mail, which we soon found has been floating around the Internet in one version or another since at least 2009.

As we researched, we quickly realized two important points. First, the chain e-mail’s numbers are wrong. Second, explaining Medicare premiums is pretty complicated.

So let’s start with a few Medicare basics: Medicare is the government-run health insurance program for Americans over age 65. Medicare’s Part A, which all beneficiaries receive, pays for hospitalization, while Part B pays for doctor’s visits and other regular health-care services.

Based on the numbers it uses for premiums, it’s clear the chain e-mail is referring to what Medicare beneficiaries pay monthly for Medicare Part B premiums.

Medicare calculates those premiums each year based on several factors that change from year to year. So the e-mail’s claim to know what Medicare premiums will be in the future doesn’t hold much water.

In addition to that, the chain e-mail gets existing numbers wrong. Part B premiums were $96.40 back in 2009 (likely when the e-mail was first written). In 2011, the official monthly premium is $115.40. And as we were working on this report, the 2012 numbers were formally announced. The premium is $99.90 for 2012, not the $104.20 that the e-mail predicted.

Also, ""Obamacare"" -- formally known as the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act -- didn’t make changes to the way that the official monthly rate for Medicare Part B premiums is calculated.

There is some fine print here, though, and quite a bit of it.

Most Medicare beneficiaries in 2011 still paid the 2009 amount, thanks to rules that say Medicare premiums cannot go up for existing beneficiaries if Social Security payments don’t go up. (This is known as the ""hold harmless"" provision.) Social Security payments did not go up in 2010 or 2011 because there was no cost-of-living increase due to a lack of inflation.

On Oct. 19, the federal government announced there would be a cost-of-living, or COLA, increase in 2012. So even though the official Medicare rate dropped for 2012, most Medicare beneficiaries will see a small increase in rates, from the 2009 rate of $96.40 to the 2012 rate of $99.90.

On the other end of the spectrum, some high-earning retirees pay more than the standard monthly premium. In 2011, beneficiaries who report income of more than $85,000 pay higher rates, all the way up to $369.10 for a person with income above $214,000 a year, or couples with income above $428,000. (See this chart for more details.)

And the health care law does make changes to these rules affecting high earners -- it stops indexing the income limits for inflation through 2019, said Gail Wilensky, who ran the Medicare program under President George H.W. Bush in the early 1990s. It means that ""more people will hit the threshold that substantially reduces the subsidy received,"" Wilensky said, and it was not widely noted when the law passed.

Here, we should explain a bit more about how basic Medicare premiums are calculated. It’s required by law that Medicare Part B beneficiaries contribute to the cost of their health care via premiums. Right now, the contributions are required to be about 25 percent of total costs. So every year, Medicare figures out what that 25 percent will probably be and then sets rates to meet that target.

It’s surprising that the official rate is going down for 2012, given recent trends on escalating health care costs -- U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius called it ""pretty remarkable"" in a conference call on Oct. 27, 2011, announcing the changes.

Medicare administrator Donald Berwick said the low premiums were due to two changes. First, because of Social Security going up, more people will be eligible to pay the official rate, rather than remaining at an older rate due to the ""hold harmless"" provision. So increasing costs will be shared among a larger pool of beneficiaries. Second, he said that health care spending was growing more slowly than projected. (He credited that to increased emphasis on prevention and effective treatments.)

Our ruling

The chain e-mail claimed that Medicare Part B premiums would increase dramatically in future years because of the health care law supported by President Barack Obama. We couldn’t find evidence to support the e-mail’s numbers. And in fact, most Medicare beneficiaries will only pay $3.50 more a month in 2012. The e-mail’s projection for 2014 seems entirely fabricated. The health care law leaves in place the long-established methods for calculating Medicare Part B premiums. The chain e-mail makes the additional unproved claim that its allegations -- which are false anyway -- were accomplished nefariously and delayed for political purposes. We rate its claims Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097056CC0>],/factchecks/2011/oct/27/chain-email/medicare-premiums-going-due-obamacare-chain-e-mail/
"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Connie Mack']","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack said he wouldn't run for U.S. Senate — now adviser says he's in
","
""The time is not right for me,"" (U.S. Rep. Connie) Mack said. ""You have to put family and friends above political ambitions, and that is what I have done.""
—March 25, 2011, Fort Myers News-Press

""Connie Mack is running for the U.S. Senate. ...,"" said David James, a senior adviser.
—Oct. 26, 2011, Miami Herald

In March 2011, U.S. Rep. Connie Mack said he would make a major announcement on the Lee County Courthouse steps. 

It was the spot where his father, Connie Mack III, had announced a Senate run in 1987.

Some assumed the Fort Myers Republican would enter the 2012 race to face Democratic U.S. Sen. Bill Nelson.

Instead, he said his family would come first. He would seek re-election to his House seat rather than run for U.S. Senate.

""I've got two small children and it’s hard enough to get to spend a lot of good quality time now. I have a wife. They are all very important to me and at the end of the day family has to be No. 1,"" Mack told the St. Petersburg Times.

In July, when his friend state Senate President Mike Haridopolos dropped out of the Republican race for Nelson's seat, the question came up again.

Mack had been seen in Washington, D.C., meeting with a political strategist. Might he be planning to step into the Senate contest?

He told St. Petersburg Times reporter Alex Leary he was focused on his current job.

""So you're ruling it out?"" Leary asked.

His reply: ""Yeah."" 
In August, he spoke to Lee County Women Republicans. He said he kept hearing his name mentioned as a candidate, the Fort Myers News-Press reported. 
""He's getting in the race,"" adviser David James told the St. Petersburg Times. ""Making calls, assembling a team. He will have more to say in an announcement in weeks to come.""

""Connie Mack is running for the U.S. Senate,"" James told the Miami Herald. 'He is making calls. He is assembling a team. And he will have more to announce about the run in the weeks ahead.""

""I can confirm that he is getting in,"" he told the News-Press.

Mack has yet to make an official announcement. But an adviser speaking for him says he'll be running for the seat that less than a year ago he declared he wouldn't pursue for the sake of his ""two small children."" We'll revisit our ruling if Mack fails to join the race. But for now, he's gone from ruling it out to assembling a team.

"['Government Regulation', 'Florida', 'Guns', 'Jim Waldman']","
Rep. Waldman says ""You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board”
","
In the old days, before Oct. 1, 2011, when folks headed to the beach or a park in some Florida cities, local laws forbade them from strapping a gun to their bathing suit or bringing it along in the picnic basket.

But in the wake of the deadly shooting in Tucson, Florida legislators during the 2011 legislative session took up a slew of pro-gun laws and one -- House Bill 45 -- made it loud and clear that it's up to the state, not each individual city or local government, to set firearm laws. And that means holders of concealed weapons permits are free to bring that gun along with the sunblock and sandwiches to a local or state park.

State law doesn't allow permit holders to bring their guns everywhere -- in fact there's a long list that shows everywhere guns aren't allowed including: 

• ""Any meeting of the governing body of a county, public school district, municipality, or special district;""
• ""Any meeting of the Legislature or a committee thereof;""
• ""Any school, college, or professional athletic event not related to firearms;""
• ""Any elementary or secondary school facility or administration building."" 
• ""Any place where the carrying of firearms is prohibited by federal law.""

State Rep. Jim Waldman, D-Coconut Creek, who voted against House Bill 45, wants his home county of Broward essentially carved out of the law, so he plans to file a bill to ban carrying guns in many local government buildings in Broward County. 

In an Oct. 24 posting on the political blog browardbeat.com, Waldman said: ""You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board. It is the height of hypocrisy.""

Waldman's words drew more than a dozen comments from readers and these caught our eye:

""Jimbo is wrong. It’s legal to bring your gun into the Capitol. It’s illegal to bring it into the chamber, hence the 2nd metal detectors before you enter…""

""Maybe Jim should file a bill to allow guns into the Capitol, instead. Let’s see how the gun nuts go for that.""

We wanted to check Waldman's claim: Is it illegal to walk into the Capitol with a gun but visitors can pay a visit to the County Commission or School Board with a loaded weapon?

Waldman's bill and House Bill 45

First, a word about Waldman's proposed bill, which was in the process of being drafted as of Oct. 27. Waldman's bill would make it illegal to carry a handgun or concealed weapon or firearm within certain government buildings in Broward including the Broward County Governmental Center, the school district's administration building and one building in each city designated by city commissions. Violators would face a second-degree misdemeanor.

Broward County has suggested an even broader ban to include additional county sites and Broward's state legislative delegation will have to decide how to proceed on both proposals. (A political aside: a bill tightening gun restrictions from Broward's mostly Democratic legislative delegation will face an uphill battle in Republican-dominated Tallahassee. But we're checking Waldman's facts here -- not his odds.)

House Bill 45, which generally prohibits local governments from regulating firearms, passed the House 85-33 on April 26, 2011, and the Senate 30-8 on April 28 and was approved by Gov. Rick Scott June 2. The law allows judgments of up to $100,000 against local governments that enforce such laws, and local officials could be fired and fined $5,000.

As the law was set to take effect Oct. 1, cities began eliminating ordinances that banned guns from parks or other places. 

Guns at the Capitol
  
Waldman said, ""You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun...""

In short, he misfired.

PolitiFact Florida asked the Florida Department of Law Enforcement, which oversees the Capitol Police, to explain what HB 45 means with respect to gun-toting visitors at the Capitol.

""Effective October 1 (as a result of passage of HB 45), concealed weapons permit holders may bring firearms into the Capitol,"" spokeswoman Heather Smith wrote in an e-mail. ""Upon entry, Capitol Police will check that the individual has a permit to carry a concealed firearm. Capitol Police will also provide a written notice that advises them that they are prohibited from entering rooms where the Legislature is in session or in committee. If requested, we do have the ability to temporarily store those firearms (on a limited basis). Prior to HB 45, only sworn law enforcement officers could bring firearms into the Capitol."" 

There are metal detectors to get into the Capitol and the public galleries of the House and Senate but not committee rooms, Smith said. 

So that means a person with a valid concealed weapons permit can bring a gun to meet with Rep. Waldman in his office -- but not to watch him vote or speak in the House chamber or during a committee meeting. So Waldman was wrong when he said you can't walk into the Capitol with a gun.

Guns and the School Board/County Commission
  
What about the rest of Waldman's claim: ""...but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board.""

State statute 790.06  lists where you can't bring a gun including any meeting of a governing body of a county, public school district or city as well as to any school event not related to firearms, or school facility or administration building.

So clearly the statute says you can't bring a gun to a county commission or school board meeting. But could you bring a gun to a commissioner's office?

Kraig Conn, an attorney with the Florida League of Cities which fought House Bill 45, said he has gotten about 50 phone calls or e-mails from cities and counties as they struggle to interpret the law. Some may interpret the law to mean permit holders are only forbidden from carrying their guns into the actual room where the commissioners are meeting while others may interpret it to mean that guns are forbidden in city hall -- period.

""If I'm a city attorney, I'm thinking I really don't want my elected city officials, or administrators, to be charged with a violation, and I would interpret this to mean you can bring your gun if you have a concealed weapons permit but you absolutely cannot have access to the meeting room,"" Conn said. ""If it's a small city hall and there are not a bunch of other offices in it, I'm going to go out on a limb and say you can't bring the gun in the building at all while there’s a meeting."" 

Broward assistant county attorney Tricia Brissett wrote in an e-mail that the statute means visitors can't carry a firearm into a county commission meeting but wouldn't answer if visitors could carry guns into areas of county buildings where commissioners aren't meeting. Broward has taken down signs that announced a gun ban -- a clue that the county isn't interpreting the law to mean a total prohibition on guns at the county's administration building. 

Miami-Dade County interprets the law to mean permit holders can't bring a gun into the county commission meeting, Miami-Dade assistant county attorney Jess McCarty said. But the gun-holder can bring the gun to meet with the mayor in his office.

Any clarification of the law won't occur until the Legislature takes it up again or there are legal challenges, Conn said.

Waldman's explanation 

In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Waldman said his statement was wrong. 
  
""I'm not sure if what was quoted was exactly what I said. I probably didn't say it artfully enough. You can't go into chambers or a committee meeting where we are meeting, where legislators are,"" with a gun, he said. ""We protect ourselves but we don't protect our staff. That is the hypocrisy I was talking about. .... You can bring a gun if you have a concealed weapons permit into a Capitol building.""
  
We were still confused because Waldman's proposed bill doesn't address protecting staff who work at the Capitol -- it's about gun access at local government buildings such as county hall and the school district.

""Administration areas of the school board and county commission are not protected, that's what I was trying to say,"" Waldman said. ""I didn't say it very clearly I have to admit that.""

But the law does clearly say that guns are prohibited at ""any elementary or secondary school facility or administration building."" So we asked Waldman, why include Broward's school administration building in his bill?

Waldman interpreted the law to mean guns aren't allowed in administration facilities within schools -- not the administration building itself.

Buddy Nevins, the reporter who writes browardbeat.com, told PolitiFact that he quoted Waldman accurately. ""He did not qualify it himself,"" Nevins said. 
  
Our ruling 

Waldman said: ""You are prohibited from walking into the Capitol with a gun, but you can go after the County Commission or the School Board."" On the first half of the sentence Waldman spoke too broadly -- permit holders can walk into the Capitol with a gun but can't carry that gun into a meeting of the House or Senate. And it's clear that you can't carry a gun into a meeting of the county commission or school board but at least some government attorneys interpret the law to mean you can carry your gun into a commissioner's office at city or county hall.
