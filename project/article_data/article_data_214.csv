Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate Rebecca Dallet says opponent Michael Screnock has Koch backing
","The involvement of conservative industrialists David and Charles Koch in Wisconsin politics is no secret. In early March 2018, Concerned Veterans for America -- a group underwritten by the billionaire brothers -- said it planned to spend $1.6 million to air two ads attacking Democratic U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin over past problems at the Tomah Veterans Affairs Medical Center. In 2017, Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin, a conservative group backed by the Kochs, launched what it labeled a ""seven-figure"" TV ad buy against Baldwin, up for re-election in 2018. Now, state Supreme Court candidate Rebecca Dallet, a Milwaukee County Circuit judge, claims the Koch brothers are backing her opponent, Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock. In what is officially a nonpartisan race that will be decided by voters April 3, 2018, Screnock is backed by conservative groups, while liberal groups are supporting Dallet. Dallet made the claim during a Feb. 2, 2018, interview on UpFront with Mike Gousha on WISN-TV, saying Screnock ""is running with the hashtag Wisconsin right. He is running with the Koch brothers support, with the Walker machine support."" Of those three elements, the most politically inflammatory one is the Koch brothers -- often used by the left to tag someone as out of step with voters. Is Dallet right about the Koch connection? The claim When asked to provide backup for the claim, the Dallet campaign pointed to a Jan. 23, 2018, Associated Press article in the Chicago Tribune, which described two Screnock campaign advisers as having ""deeply partisan"" backgrounds:    Sean Lansing is a former Republican operative who also previously worked for the Koch brothers group Americans for Prosperity in both Wisconsin and Virginia. And Luke Hilgemann is the former state director of Americans for Prosperity in Wisconsin and CEO of Americans for Prosperity nationwide. Hilgemann and Lansing recently purchased the Champion Group LLC, a political consulting group, from Keith Gilkes, a longtime adviser to Gov. Scott Walker. ""Big-money special interests have spent over $1.3 million to try and buy a loyal Justice on Wisconsin's Supreme Court,"" said Dallet campaign manager Jessica Lovejoy. ""And Judge Screnock's team is full of Koch brothers operatives who boast resumes full of shady Koch brothers organizations."" But that wasn’t Dallet’s claim. Lansing noted he and Hilgemann once worked for Americans for Prosperity, but said ""we no longer have any affiliation with the organization."" Indeed, in the campaign world, it is not unusual for operatives to move between campaigns and interest groups. So, that alone is not enough to back the claim. Indeed, there is no evidence of the most direct form of support from either of the Koch brothers  -- a campaign contribution or endorsement. Looking further Of course, there are other ways to ""support"" a campaign or candidate, such as running TV or radio ads in support of a candidate, or in opposition to an opponent. Does any of that apply here? Scot Ross, executive director of the liberal advocacy group One Wisconsin Now, argued that Americans for Prosperity-Wisconsin is essentially ""the field operation for turning out Republican voters in elections. They have a long track record of doing this and are not shy about advertising it."" He cited a series of tweets the group sent that noted its get-out-the-vote efforts for the February 2018 primary -- a contest in which the Supreme Court race was the only statewide one on the ballot. On Feb. 17, 2018, the group tweeted:  ""The Spring Primary election is only THREE days away and our activists in Racine are working hard to get out the vote before Tuesday!"" The same day it tweeted: ""Our Green Bay office is ready for our Get out the Vote #DayofAction  today! Make sure you make a plan + head to the polls on Feb. 20th!"" Efforts to reach Eric Bott, director of the Wisconsin branch of Americans for Prosperity via telephone and email, were unsuccessful. The get-out-the-vote effort represents support in a broad sense, in that the Koch-backed group wanted to get conservative voters to the polls, which would have benefited Screnock. Is there anything more concrete? The Wisconsin Democracy Campaign, a nonprofit organization that tracks money in Wisconsin state politics and advocates for campaign finance reform, said as of March 27, 2018, the two candidates combined had raised more than $1.2 million since the beginning of the year. Campaign finance reports filed by the candidates show the state GOP and longtime Republican donors backing Screnock, while unions and traditional Democratic contributors supported Dallet. The Democracy Campaign reported that Screnock’s latest reports showed his two largest contributors as the Republican Party of Wisconsin (about $293,450) and Diane Hendricks of Beloit, chairwoman of ABC Supply ($20,000). Dallet’s latest campaign reports showed her two largest contributors were the Wisconsin Education Association Council political action committee ($18,000) and Madison Teachers Inc. PAC ($18,000). Meanwhile, the Democracy Campaign also reported that during the race, a group called the Wisconsin Alliance for Reform purchased about $63,600 in advertising on Milwaukee and La Crosse television and radio stations during the last two weeks before the Feb.  20, 2018, primary. The primary race featured Dallet, Screnock and Madison lawyer Tim Burns. The Democracy Campaign says the group has used a Madison post office box and a Milwaukee phone number as its only contact information: The Alliance’s website was initially registered by Lorri Pickens, a former director at Americans for Prosperity, which is funded by billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch to spend money on Republican and conservative candidates for state and federal offices around the country. So, that provides some additional evidence, albeit several steps removed from the Koch brothers themselves. Our rating    Dallet says her Supreme Court rival Michael Screnock ""is running with the Koch brothers support.""   But while Screnock’s views would clearly match more closely with theirs than the views of Dallet, there is no evidence the billionaire brothers have given money directly to Screnock’s campaign or made statements supportive of it. The primary group they support -- Americans for Prosperity, a group that backs Republicans -- has been active in the race, through get out the vote efforts, not ad buys. In addition, another group that may be tied to the Koch brothers did some ad buys in the primary. We rate Dallet’s claim Half True.  ",/factchecks/2018/mar/29/rebecca-dallet/wisconsin-supreme-court-candidate-rebecca-dallet-s/

Is the United States third in murders and are outlier cities to blame? No.
","A viral meme shared on social media following the Parkland, Fla., shooting claimed the United States has the third-highest count of murders worldwide, a ranking that would drop dramatically if five major cities were excluded. The image has been circulating since at least 2015. We decided to take a closer look. Is the United States third in murders, and are a few outlier cities responsible? That’s false by any standard. The main study of intentional homicides is performed by the United Nations’ Office of Drug Control. The UN warns against cross-national comparisons because of the differences in legal definitions of intentional homicides and recording practices. Our count of the UN’s data placed the United States ninth in intentional homicides. We used the most up-to-date count for each country and territory, which included data anywhere from 2007 to 2015. As the country with the third-highest population size, however, experts told us the number of people killed is not a very useful metric. Controlling for population size, most criminologists use the per 100,000 metric. By that standard, we found the United States ranked 94th. When we counted only the countries for which the UN had 2015 data, the United States ranked 73rd. That’s still far from the top ten. The meme argues that a few outlier cities with stringent gun control legislation are responsible for the United States’ high homicide count. But that’s not true, either. Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans have homicide rates well above the national average, but that’s typical for large urban cities. While Detroit, St. Louis and New Orleans are consistently among the top five American cities by homicide rate, the cities with most per-capita murders vary from year to year. Neither Washington, D.C., nor Chicago make the top five. Chicago has a high number of homicides because of its population, but its homicide rate is middle of the road for large U.S. cities, according to Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida. Specific reasons for the cities’ high murder rates largely remain a mystery for criminologists, but all are cities with ""high poverty levels, inequality, significant segregation, and an entrenched drug trade,"" Corzine said. Dropping them from the U.S. total has little substantive impact on the U.S. homicide rate or count. The cities cited in the meme accounted for 1,568 of 17,250, or 9.1 percent, of all homicides reported to the FBI in 2016, Tom Kovandzic, a criminologist at the University of Texas, Dallas, calculated for us. And without those cities, the homicide rate (per capita) would only decline by 7.73 percent, or from 5.34 to 4.93. When we applied those reductions to the UN data, the United States barely budged in its international standing. It moved down four spots in per capita murders and stayed the same in total murders. That’s inconsequential compared with the 186-spot jump the meme concocted. Gun control laws are mostly controlled by state legislatures. Washington, D.C., is the only listed city able to enact strict ordinances, while Chicago can do some things, according to Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Association. We’ve previously rated the claim that Chicago has the strictest gun laws Pants on Fire. ""The other lie in this claim is that all five of the named cities have stringent gun regulation. Louisiana, Michigan and Missouri would be very surprised to hear that!"" said Philip Cook, a sociologist at Duke University. The states didn’t impress the Giffords Law Center, a pro-gun control group. Missouri ranked 48th, Louisiana 43rd, and Michigan 16th on a scale that gives higher rankings to restricted gun ownership and use. The image said, ""The United States is 3rd in murders throughout the world. If you remove Chicago, Detroit, Washington, St. Louis and New Orleans, the United States is then 189th out of 193 countries in the entire world."" By no measure is the United States third in total homicides or homicide rates. Excluding the named cities from the count had little to no impact on the United States’ international standing. Three of the cities named in the meme are consistently the top cities for intentional homicides in the United States, but the other two are not. They are by no means outliers, either.

Was Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day?
","After an Ohio high school student’s suspension notice was posted on social media, claims went viral that he was suspended for not participating in National Walkout Day one month after the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas. ""Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day,"" a Fox News headline stated March 16. The Associated Press had a similar headline: ""Ohio student suspended for staying in class during walkouts."" Many right-leaning websites repeated the story about Jacob Shoemaker, a senior at Hilliard Davidson High School, located in a suburb of Columbus, with hashtags such as #LiberalismIsAMentalDisorder and #DefendThe2nd. Facebook users flagged the posts as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat online hoaxes. Shoemaker’s suspension notice, posted on social media by a friend, stated: ""student refused to follow instructions after being warned repeatedly by several administrators."" While some social media posts presented the situation as the school punishing a student for refusing to call for gun control, the situation was actually more nuanced. Shoemaker was suspended following National Walkout Day when thousands of students nationwide walked out of school one month after the massacre in Parkland to protest gun violence and call for gun control. The first paragraph of the Fox News story shows that Shoemaker didn’t want to follow the alternative for students who didn’t want to attend the walkout: ""An Ohio high school student said he tried to stay apolitical during the National Walkout Day over gun violence but was suspended for his choice to remain in a classroom instead of joining protests or the alternative, going to study hall."" Shoemaker told Fox News that he didn’t want to take sides in the gun-control debate so he chose to stay in the classroom and do school work instead. ""They presented the situation of the national walkout in such a way to where it really seemed they were forcing me to make a choice, a political choice in the classroom,"" he said. ""I didn’t like that I was going to have to decide whether I was anti-violence and pro-gun control or if I was to stay inside and be pro-gun violence, effectively. It didn’t feel right to have to make that decision."" Shoemaker’s father Scott Shoemaker posted a message on Facebook March 16: ""My son was suspended for not leaving the room to either join a demonstration or reporting to the commons. He was uncomfortable going to either location as he thought that going outside would most likely be politicizing a horrific event which he wanted no part of, but staying inside would make him look disrespectful or insensitive to 17 innocent victims if it turned out to be more of a memorial service. ""This had nothing to do with his own political beliefs, but with politics in school in general. Students should not have been forced to leave their classrooms, choose a side, and be politically divided. He got support from students on both sides of the political aisle after returning today, but he felt there were other students and staff angry with him for taking this position."" Fox News reported a statement from the school: ""As a district, we are required to supervise students during the school day. We do not leave students unattended in classrooms. .... This is the same practice our district implements when students opt out of other school programs or activities. We provide an alternative, supervised location."" We found the school’s full statement on its website, which stated that no students were forced to participate in the walkout. ""In fact, student participation overall was well under 50 percent of the student population. The majority of students were comfortable and confident in not participating in these gatherings. Students who chose not to participate were provided safe, supervised alternatives in all three high schools. No one was forced or coerced to participate. No one was disciplined for not participating. Our school culture respects the rights of all students. We strive to provide a safe environment for all students, but we do expect students to follow directions and comply with staff requests. This is required to maintain an orderly school environment."" School spokeswoman Stacie Raterman told PolitiFact that students opting not to attend the walkout were able to go to supervised study halls in different classrooms and the commons area. She said she couldn’t comment on any individual student’s discipline due to federal privacy laws but said about a dozen students at Davidson were suspended after attending the memorial gathering but not returning to class. A Fox News network spokeswoman did not have any additional comment. Many online headlines said, ""Ohio student suspended for staying in class during National Walkout Day."" The headline in and of itself could lead viewers to reach a misleading conclusion that the student was suspended for simply opting out of the walkout. But the story states that he was suspended because he didn’t take the alternative the school district offered, which was to attend a supervised study hall instead. The school said that less than half of the students participated in the walk out and that no one was disciplined for opting out of it, but they had to remain in a place supervised by staff.

Did the U.S. have a $500 billion deficit with China in 2017?
","President Donald Trump ratcheted up pressure on Beijing by announcing tariffs on up to $60 billion worth of imported Chinese goods. Trump has long bemoaned the United States’ trade deficit with China, and as a candidate he promised to use import taxes to reorder trade arrangements along what he believes are more reciprocal lines. ""Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China,"" Trump said at a March 23 news conference. ""We can't let that happen."" A country’s trade balance is simply the difference between the value of its imports and exports, and a trade deficit occurs when imports exceed exports. This can be measured in terms of goods, or both goods and services. We took a closer look at Trump’s numbers. It turns out he’s well off the mark. The United States’ deficit with China in goods trade has grown substantially over roughly the past two decades. The deficit in 1990 was $10.4 billion. It grew to $83.8 billion in 2000 and swelled to $273 billion in 2010, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission. In 2017, the value of Chinese goods imported to the United States ($505 billion) exceeded American goods exports to China ($130 billion) by roughly $375 billion. Americans racked up billions in purchases of everything from Chinese-made communications and computer equipment, to kitchen appliances and shoes. Based on trade in goods, Trump's $500 billion figure is off by $125 billion. When you factor in goods and services, which economists say paints the fuller picture, his claim is further off the mark. According to data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis, the United States actually ran a surplus in the services trade with China in 2017 — to the tune of roughly $38.5 billion. When you factor that surplus into the two countries’ overall trade balance, the United States ran a roughly $336 billion deficit with China last year — which means Trump’s figure was off by about $164 billion. It’s possible Trump may have confused the Chinese deficit with the United States’ overall trade deficit, which was $566 billion in 2017, according to the bureau. However, it’s also possible Trump used the $500 billion figure as a matter of habit. We rated this claim Mostly False when he said it in 2015. Trump said, ""Last year we lost $500 billion on trade with China."" In 2017, the value of Chinese goods imported to the United States exceeded American goods exports to China by roughly $375 billion. Over that same period, the United States actually ran a $38.5 billion surplus on services trade with China. Overall, in terms of both goods and services, the United States trade deficit with China in 2017 was around $336 billion — meaning Trump was off by roughly $164 billion.

Wisconsin GOP attack on Supreme Court candidate Rebecca Dallet mostly misfires
","In what is nominally a nonpartisan state Supreme Court campaign, the Wisconsin Republican Party is supporting Sauk County Circuit Judge Michael Screnock, who is backed by conservatives. With the April 3, 2018, election drawing near, the party attacked Milwaukee County Circuit Judge Rebecca Dallet, who is supported by liberals. On billboards in Milwaukee, Green Bay and Eau Claire that were announced March 12, 2018, the GOP claimed: ""Hypocrite Rebecca Dallet took money from attorneys with over 100 cases before her."" Dallet has taken campaign contributions from lawyers who have cases before her -- which is not uncommon and is not prohibited by the state Judicial Commission. But the thrust of the GOP’s claim -- that Dallet is a ""hypocrite"" because she took the contributions -- misfires. The money The billboards refer to more than 100 cases, with roughly three-quarters of them that were pending when Dallet received campaign donations from lawyers on those cases. Other cases cited either had not yet been filed or had been closed. The largest donation was $2,500 from attorney Howard Sicula in June 2017. He had a wrongful death case pending in Dallet’s court at the time. Now to the thrust of the GOP’s claim. Dallet a ‘hypocrite’? The billboard refers viewers to an anti-Dallet state GOP website. It cites comments Dallet made at a Jan. 22, 2018 Federalist Society Supreme Court debate. Dallet began by saying: ""So, I do recuse myself when there is any appearance that it’s not going to be fair."" The GOP contends that statement means Dallet is a hypocrite because she took campaign contributions from lawyers who had cases before her. But the rest of Dallet’s statement makes it clear she didn’t pledge not to take campaign contributions from lawyers, but rather that she would recuse herself from cases in which her husband’s law firm was involved. She also drew a contrast with the first campaign of state Supreme Court Justice Michael Gableman, who decided not to seek reelection. Here’s the rest of Dallet’s statement during the debate: My husband works for Husch Blackwell, a larger firm, and I made the decision to remove myself from any case that they handle. That is not required by our ethics rules … but I decided that the better course of action, so that it is fair to everyone involved, is to just recuse myself from all those cases …. This is not about contributions from attorneys to our campaigns; that is allowed by our ethics rules. And certainly if it was an extreme amount, that would be something that the judge would have to look at.  What we’re talking about with our recusal rules, that is the issue that I’ve been talking about, is the fact that when a party is in front of the case (judge) and that party has spent money -- significant amount of money, massive amounts of money, like the $2.25 million spent on Justice Gableman’s campaign -- how can anyone look at that and think that that’s fair? Dallet also referred to recusing herself from cases involving her husband’s firm in January 2018 at a candidates event and in an interview. Although it does not bear on the rating of this fact check, it’s worth noting that the Wisconsin State Journal reported in early March 2018 that Dallet presided over at least one case involving attorneys from her husband’s law firm; and that Dallet recused herself from three recent cases on her docket involving attorneys from the firm after being asked about them by the newspaper. Our rating The state Republican Party says Dallet is a ""hypocrite"" because she ""took money from attorneys with over 100 cases before her."" Dallet has received campaign donations from lawyers who had cases in her court -- something that is common in judicial campaigns and allowed by state judicial ethics rules. But on the hypocrite part of the GOP’s statement, Dallet did not pledge that she would not accept contributions from lawyers who had cases before her. Rather, her pledge was to recuse herself from cases in which her husband’s law firm was involved. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our rating is Mostly False.

NC Democrats say Republicans redirected $58M meant for job creation
","Approval of a key permit for the Atlantic Coast Pipeline through Eastern North Carolina has been among the most hotly debated political moves this year. The state Department of Environmental Quality in January signed off on the permit for the 600-mile pipeline, which is expected to deliver natural gas to the eastern part of the state from fracking operations in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Shortly after Gov. Roy Cooper’s administration approved the permit, Cooper announced that pipeline builders Dominion Power and Duke Energy planned to put $57.8 million in a fund to be used for environmental and economic-development initiatives. Some advocacy groups worry the pipeline will hurt the environment. Meanwhile, many Republicans in the GOP-controlled N.C. General Assembly questioned the legality of the mitigation fund and accused Cooper’s administration of conducting pay-to-play politics. They suggested Cooper required pipeline builders to fund mitigation efforts in order to acquire the permit, which Cooper has denied. In February, the legislature voted to redirect the $57.8 million to schools in districts that the pipeline would run through. In response, the North Carolina Democratic Party recently launched an ad campaign that targets Republicans in Eastern North Carolina districts. The online ads and mailers say state Reps. John Bell and Brenden Jones, as well as state Sen. Danny Britt ""raided $58 million that was supposed to help create jobs for North Carolinians."" Every seat in the N.C. General Assembly is up for election this year and Democrats hope to gain influence in Raleigh. Republicans hold a supermajority in both the state House and state Senate. But, aiming to capitalize on President Donald Trump’s unpopularity, Democrats expect to break the supermajority and hope to take control of at least one of the chambers in midterm elections this fall. The N.C. Democratic Party told reporters in a press briefing on March 22 that their messaging on the Atlantic Coast Pipeline in Eastern North Carolina has been effective. In an email to PolitiFact, party spokesman Robert Howard defended the mailers as both ""factually accurate and intellectually honest."" The party ""launched digital ads and mailers to hold Republican politicians accountable for raiding a fund meant to help eastern North Carolina access the Atlantic Coast Pipeline,"" Howard said in an email. ""The funds would have gone towards economic development in Eastern North Carolina by covering costs of fuel distribution lines as well as renewable energy projects. Republicans diverted funds through HB90 as part of a 'poison pill' provision in an omnibus bill that included a Democratic priority – funding for the class size mandate."" Mitigation money Cooper’s office said half of the $57.8 million is supposed to go toward mitigating the environmental damage the pipeline may cause to wetlands, streams and wildlife habitats. The rest is designated for economic development and renewable energy projects. However, the deal didn't specify the projects or the number of jobs that would be created. The state would receive half of the $57.8 million once the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission has approved the pipeline; the rest would be paid upon its completion. Sadie Weiner, Cooper's communications director, said the Rural Infrastructure Authority and the Clean Water Management Trust Fund are two agencies that could distribute the funds. On the economic side, WRAL reported the Cooper administration hoped the money would help farmers in Eastern North Carolina hook into distribution lines tied back to the pipeline. They hoped the new gas connections would not only prevent economic damages, but also create jobs. Durwood Stephenson, director of the U.S. 70 Corridor Commission, and Norris Tolsen, president of the Carolinas Gateway Partnership, told WRAL that they’d heard from companies unwilling to consider Eastern North Carolina manufacturing sites without easy access to natural gas, and the Atlantic Coast Pipeline planned just three taps along the project's 200-mile route through the state. Prior to DEQ’s approval of the pipeline permit, utility companies ran commercials claiming the project would bring jobs to NC. Where the money went Democrats and many school advocates across the state had been lobbying the legislature to avoid what they called ""class size chaos,"" which they said would happen if state laws went into effect this summer requiring schools to lower average K-3 class sizes from 20 students per room this school year to roughly 17 students in July. School leaders had said they didn't have the thousands of extra classrooms needed and might have to fire art, music and physical education teachers to help come up with the money to hire additional K-3 teachers. House Bill 90 pushed back the class size deadline for schools and redirected the mitigation funds to go to school districts in the eight counties the pipeline would run through. The ads provided to PolitiFact don't say what Republicans did with the mitigation money. They also omit details about the vote, giving the impression that the vote was overwhelmingly partisan. But a majority of Democrats voted for it too – including many from Eastern North Carolina. The vote In the state House, the bill passed 104-12. In the state Senate, it passed 37-5. In fact, none of the House Democrats from areas east of Raleigh opposed the bill. And in the Senate, Angela Bryant was the only Democrat from Eastern North Carolina to oppose the bill. So, on paper, it appears as if many Democrats wanted to redirect money from the pipeline mitigation fund. However, some Democrats said they only voted for the bill because it funneled money to needy schools. Republicans hold majorities in the House and Senate and could’ve redirected the mitigation money without support from Democrats. So Democrats had two realistic options. They could oppose the bill, supporting Cooper but risking the chance that Republicans accuse them of not prioritizing education. Or they could support the bill, breaking with Cooper on the pipeline fund but going on record as supporting education. Most chose the latter. Cooper, for his part, said he supported the class size changes and didn’t veto the bill. ""Democratic lawmakers strongly objected to Republicans’ decision to address changes to the state elections board, the Atlantic Coast Pipeline mitigation fund, and a class size fix in a single piece of legislation,"" said Howard of NCDP. ""Many Democratic politicians stated publicly that they are voting in favor of bill solely because of the class size funding measure."" What Democrats said State Reps. Garland Pierce and Bobbie Richardson, Democrats from Eastern North Carolina, voted for the bill. But they stood next to House Minority Leader Darren Jackson of Wake County during a press conference as he denounced Republicans for tying education funding to the pipeline. Jackson said it put Democrats in a political predicament in an election year. ""There will be a lot of support obviously for the class size and pre-K fix."" The rest of the bill, Jackson said, ""is an attempt to get the governor to veto it or us to vote against it so they can run political ads."" State Sen. Erica Smith, a Democrat from Eastern North Carolina, supported the bill but noted the situation in her statement to Policy Watch, a news arm of a liberal-leaning think tank. ""When you put these provisions in this bill in this manner in which it is, you make it unfair. You make it political,"" Smith is quoted saying. State Sen. Paul Lowe, a Forsyth County Democrat, said some only voted for the bill while holding their noses. ""But it’s bad, really bad. You didn’t have to do it this way."" State Rep. Gale Adcock, a Cary Democrat who voted for the bill, noted that Republicans could have addressed the education and pipeline issues separately – but chose not to. She described the bill as ""a bitter pill."" Our ruling An NC Democratic Party ad campaign claims Republicans in the legislature ""raided $58 million that was supposed to help create jobs for North Carolinians."" It's unclear how many jobs the mitigation fund would create. The party also withheld the fact that Democrats voted for the bill too, and that the mitigation fund was diverted to schools. But the party’s broader point is accurate. Republicans led the push to empty the mitigation fund and Democrats reluctantly went along with the effort because it was tied to education changes they supported.

Has California’s homeless population ‘skyrocketed’? And how does it rate nationwide?
","As California’s affordable housing crisis deepens, so does the state’s related and often intractable problem: homelessness. Candidates for governor made numerous assertions about the scale of California’s homeless population on March 8, 2018 during a housing forum in Sacramento. Here’s how GOP candidate and Orange County Assemblyman Travis Allen portrayed the depths of California’s human emergency: ""Homelessness has skyrocketed across California. We have the nation’s highest homelessness rate and the nation’s highest homeless population."" The state has wrestled with this topic for decades, but has homelessness really ""skyrocketed""? And how does its per capita and overall homeless population compare with other states? We set out on a fact check. Our research We found answers in a December 2017 report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development: The 2017 Annual Homeless Assessment Report (AHAR) to Congress. It includes a state-by-state comparison of homeless populations based on a one-night count in each state in January 2017. The report tallies per capita homeless rates and total homeless populations along with comprehensive sets of demographic data. Sharon Rapport, associate director for California policy at the Corporation for Supportive Housing, described the report as ""the most authoritative"" resource on the topic. CSH is a national organization that develops housing policy and makes housing loans. She noted the HUD report is a snapshot of how many people are homeless at any given time. Her organization estimates the number of people who are homeless for at least part of a year is two to three times higher than any point-in-time tally. The report shows California’s homeless population jumped nearly 14 percent from 2016 to 2017 — to a total of more than 134,00 people. It rose nearly 9 percent over the previous seven years. That’s much different than the national picture. While the national homeless population ticked up about 1 percent in 2017, it remained 13 percent lower than in 2010, according to an NPR analysis following the report’s release. Notably, the rise statewide and nationally in 2017 was attributed to a surge in the number of people living on the streets in Los Angeles and other West Coast cities, at least in part due to a shortage of affordable housing. Compared to the nation’s relatively small increase, Allen is on track when he says California’s homeless population has ""skyrocketed."" How would Allen tackle the problem? ""We need more state run mental institutions,"" the lawmaker said at the forum. The institutions would offer the homeless substance abuse and psychiatric services, he said, ""so they can get back on their feet and re-enter the workforce.""  This Tuesday, Jan. 26, 2016 file photo Eddie, 51, a homeless man who would only give his first name and lives in a tent on the street in downtown Los Angeles. (AP Photo/Richard Vogel) On this point, Allen is slightly off target. While the 2017 HUD report shows California’s per capita homeless rate is high, it’s not the highest. California has the third highest rate nationally with 34 in every 10,000 people in the state experiencing homelessness. Two states are worse off: New York and Hawaii. New York ranks second with 45 homeless people per 10,000. Hawaii, meanwhile, ranks first with 51 per 10,000. Allen is again correct on this part of his statement. The HUD report lists California’s total homeless population at 134,278. That’s about one quarter of the national homeless population of 553,742. New York was a distant second with 89,503 followed by Florida with 32,190. ""California does have the highest homeless population in the nation according to the (HUD report), but not the highest rate of homelessness. As a state, our per capita rate is amongst the highest, but it is not the highest,"" Rapport, of Corporation for Supportive Housing, summarized in an email. Our ruling Candidate for governor and state lawmaker Travis Allen recently claimed homelessness has ""skyrocketed"" in California and that the state has ""the nation’s highest homelessness rate and the nation’s highest homeless population."" A December 2017 report by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development is considered the authority on state-by-state homeless counts, and shows Allen got two of his three points correct. California’s homeless numbers jumped nearly 14 percent in 2017 as nationwide levels remained nearly flat, giving credence to his first point. Meanwhile, the report showed two other states, Hawaii and New York, have a higher per capita homeless rate than California’s. Finally, it shows California, indeed, has the highest total homeless population at 134,278, far more than second place New York. Looking at Allen’s statement in sum, he was on the mark twice and only slightly strayed from the facts on the per capita claim. For that reason, we rate his overall statement Mostly True.

David Hogg not at school during shooting? Bloggers spread misinformation
","Multiple internet bloggers falsely claimed that student David Hogg was not on the campus of  Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School when the school shooting happened Feb. 14. The inaccurate claims surfaced after CBS News produced ""39 Days,"" a documentary of several Stoneman Douglas High School students including Hogg. At the beginning of the video, Hogg, described as a student journalist, explained his immediate actions following the shooting that left 17 people dead. Some bloggers took the 14-second soundbite to insinuate that Hogg wasn’t actually at school when the shooting took place. ""In a recently leaked excerpt of a CBS documentary, David Hogg admits he was at home during the Parkland shooting,"" reads the opening of a story on Squawker.org. ""David Hogg admits he wasn’t at school during Parkland school shooting,"" says a headline on DailyPresser.com. None of those claims are true. The inaccurate posts say that Hogg’s comments directly contradict statements in a Feb. 15 Time Magazine interview. Hogg said he heard a gunshot while sitting in an AP environmental science class around 2:30 p.m. The blogs juxtaposed that statement with the following statement from Hogg in the CBS documentary: ""On the day of the shooting, I got my camera and got on my bike and rode as fast as I could three miles from my house to the school to get as much video and to get as many interviews as I could because I knew that this could not be another mass shooting."" People questioned how Hogg could be at school when the shooting started and also be riding his bike three miles to get his camera. And if Hogg really did leave school; how did he get back on to campus if the area was on lockdown? The timeline presented in this way is a bit confusing, but the blogs didn’t try to fairly settle the seeming discrepancy. Here’s what happened. Hogg was at the school during the shooting. Hogg shot a video on his cellphone while taking cover in a classroom closet. Sometime after that, he went home. At around 6 p.m., Hogg went back to get interviews, according to Vox. ""The evening after the shooting, Hogg says, he biked up to the school, where the media was still camped out,"" the article says. ""This time, he put himself in front of the camera, making his first — but not final — plea for an end to mass shootings."" Regardless of this information, other conservative news websites including InfoWars and RedState jumped the gun and reported that the CBS interview ""cast doubt"" on Hogg’s whereabouts during the school shooting. Sometime after the original stories, both websites issued ""updates"" on their stories to say that the CBS video included Hogg’s quote without context. But not every site did. ""It appears that the problem was that CBS included a very confusing quote without context,"" wrote conservative Florida writer  Sarah Rumpf, author of the errant RedState story. ""Hogg was on campus during the shooting and returned several hours later to interview people across the street."" Claims that Hogg was not at school during the shooting are not based in reality.

Ohio Republican wrongly says Sherrod Brown likes communism
","Republicans have long attacked U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, as an ultra liberal, but now one of Brown’s hopeful Republican challengers has cast the incumbent as someone who is so far to the left that he likes communism and Marxism. Mike Gibbons, a wealthy Ohio investment banker, criticized Brown’s philosophy in an interview Feb. 20 with the Republican Liberty Caucus of Ohio. Gibbons said that Brown ""majored in Russian studies at Yale University and when he majored in it -- because he would have been in (the same year as) my class -- Russia was a communist country. So he studied communism, and apparently he liked it, because a lot of his policies reflect that interest in Marxism."" Gibbons, who was the finance co-chair for a joint committee for Donald Trump and the Republican National Committee in 2016, has made comments about Brown studying Marxism or Russian multiple times on the campaign trail. He is one of many candidates, including U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, competing in the May 8 Republican primary. Gibbons’ claim is disingenuous. We found that Brown does speak up for American workers, as communists often do, but that doesn’t mean that Brown likes communism. In fact, for decades Brown has been critical of communism, particularly in China. Brown did receive a bachelor of arts in Russian and Eastern European studies from Yale in 1974. (Brown later earned master's degrees in education and public policy from Ohio State University. ) Brown’s Yale degree included courses in a broad range of disciplines, including studying the language, although Brown is not a fluent Russian speaker, his campaign spokesman Preston Maddock said. Maddock said Brown’s studies were not out of fondness for communism, and he pointed to several conservatives who also studied Russian or Russian studies, including former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates, former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and conservative talk show host Laura Ingraham. In the 1970s, Russian studies was an important area of knowledge because people were developing expertise to help combat the USSR, a major Cold War opponent, said Mark Smith director of the Center for Political Studies at Cedarville University. ""For sure, some in those programs may have been true believers in Marxism or communism, but there is no evidence of this in Brown's background,"" Smith said. ""Nothing I am aware of would cause me to question his commitment to the United States, our form of government, or the Constitution (which he has sworn to uphold and defend)."" The same year Brown graduated Yale in 1974, he won his first elected office to the Ohio House of Representatives. He later served as Ohio secretary of state and was elected to Congress in 1992. He joined the U.S. Senate in 2007. Gibbons campaign’s main piece of evidence is a 2012 article in Breitbart, a conservative publication, which cited several examples linking Brown to ""undue influence"" from the Communist Party USA. Breitbart linked to a 2003 editorial written by Brown when he was in the House. Brown criticized Congress for taking many votes on important topics, such as veterans benefits, tax cuts and money for the Iraq war, between midnight and 3 a.m. ""Always in the middle of the night,"" Brown wrote. ""Always after the press had passed their deadlines. Always after the American people had turned off the news and gone to bed."" There’s nothing about communism or Marxism in what Brown wrote, but Breitbart objected that it was re-printed by the People’s World, a publication that includes Marxist and communist opinions. But Brown’s op-ed was also published in mainstream publications such as the St. Louis Post Dispatch and the Lorain Morning Journal in Ohio. Breitbart also pointed to the People’s World celebrating Brown’s win in 2006; however, the editorial only briefly mentioned Brown and generally celebrated the national Democratic sweep when voters were mad about the war in Iraq. That fact that the People’s World supported Brown doesn’t show that Brown supported communism. Brown is best known in the Senate for his longtime opposition to trade agreements and his support for labor, beginning when he was a freshman House member in 1993 and voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement. ""Brown’s position on trade is rooted in fighting for American industry and workers and has been consistent throughout his career,"" Maddock, Brown’s spokesman, said. ""If support for fair trade deals makes Senator Brown a communist, what does the Gibbons campaign have to say about the fact that Brown and President Trump frequently agree on how to deal with trade?"" Brown has steadily earned high scores from the AFL-CIO as well as the liberal organization Americans for Democratic Action and League of Conservation Voters. Despite his liberal record, he has found common ground with the Trump administration. Brown agreed with Trump’s decision to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. He has said he will work with the Trump administration to help Ohio’s steel and manufacturing sectors, and in 2017 Brown praised Trump’s administration for asking the trade office to look into whether China had stolen U.S. technology and intellectual property University of Akron political science professor David B. Cohen noted the similarities on trade between Brown and Trump. ""Brown’s position on trade is not much different than President Trump’s position, yet Gibbons is a huge public supporter of Trump. Are Trump’s economic views Marxian?"" he said. Brown has spoken against communism for decades. After Brown lost the secretary of state re-election in 1990, he taught at Ohio State University and then worked with the Polish Ministry of Education to help rid its curriculum of Marxist-Leninist courses after the fall of the country's communist government in 1989, the Athens News reported in 2006. Brown has frequently criticized China for its communism and human rights abuses. In 1994, Brown criticized President Bill Clinton’s decision to renew Most Favored Nation trading status for China. ""This is a communist country that has made some nods to free enterprise, but still has the same oppressive communist regime,"" Brown said. ""It's almost nonsensical."" In 2015, he opposed giving the Obama administration renewed Trade Promotion Authority known as ""fast track."" In noting that Brown studied Russia as a college student, Gibbons said, ""apparently he liked it, because a lot of his policies reflect that interest in Marxism."" We found no evidence to suggest Brown supports Marxism or communism. Brown does favor American workers and opposes many free trade policies, but those are policy positions he shares with President Trump.

Joe Manchin off-target on small business share of West Virginia's economy
","Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., recently cheerleaded West Virginia small businesses in a tweet from his Senate account. Manchin tweeted, ""Did you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday"" Did you know #WV has more than 120k small businesses & they make up about 96% of our state's economy? Remember this & #shopsmall #WVSBDC #SBDCday We were surprised that small companies comprise 96 percent of West Virginia’s economy, so we took a closer look. As it turns out, Manchin used the wrong terminology, ultimately making his claim incorrect. We turned to data from the federal Small Business Administration, which offers fact sheets about small businesses in every state. Manchin’s in the ballpark for the number of small businesses in the state. The SBA counts 115,673 small businesses, a number that is apt to fluctuate regularly, as companies start up and go out of business. (The agency’s definition of a small business is one with fewer than 500 employees.) And the fact sheet has a number close to the 96 percent figure Manchin cited. The SBA says that 98.9 percent of West Virginia’s businesses are small businesses. But that does not support what Manchin said. Saying that almost 99 percent of West Virginia's businesses are small firms is not what economists refer to as a ""percentage of the economy."" That term refers to the percentage of all economic output, which is sometimes called state-level gross domestic product. The fact sheet doesn’t provide small business output as a percentage of the economy, but it’s certainly well below 96 percent. Why? Because while small businesses account for nearly 99 percent of employers in the state, they only account for about half — 50.1 percent — of West Virginia employees. So it is not credible to say that half of the workforce produces 96 percent of the output while the other half — the big-company workforce — produces just 4 percent of output. In fact, it wouldn’t be surprising if the half of West Virginia employees working for big companies account for more than half of economic output, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution. ""In the nation as a whole, employees at smaller businesses tend to earn lower compensation than employees in larger businesses, probably indicating they are less productive,"" Burtless said. ""All these facts lead me to believe there is no possible way those 120,000 small businesses can account for 96 percent of the production or output of the West Virginia economy."" Manchin’s office declined to comment for this article. Manchin said that small businesses in West Virginia ""make up about 96 percent of our state's economy."" This appears to be a case of mistaken terminology. Small businesses do make up nearly 99 percent of the state’s employers, but only half of its employees. The way it is worded, Manchin's claim exaggerates the output of small businesses and underplays the economic influence of large companies in the state.  We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/mar/26/joe-manchin/joe-manchin-target-small-business-share-west-virgi/

Sarah Palin recaps Rosemary Lehmberg's purchase of 70-plus bottles of vodka over 15 months
","Former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin singled out the Democratic district attorney of Travis County after a special grand jury in the county indicted Republican Gov. Rick Perry. In an Aug. 17, 2014, commentary on the Fox News website, Palin, the 2008 GOP vice presidential nominee, noted the local official, Rosemary Lehmberg, previously ""was busted for drunk driving with an open bottle of vodka in her car after a 911 call reported her endangering others while swerving erratically on the road. The D.A. was smashed -- three times over the legal limit,"" Palin wrote. ""She was a nut job while in custody,"" Palin said, ""disgracefully threatening law enforcement officials and lashing out violently. The D.A. had to be physically restrained. It was all caught on tape. ""The extent of the D.A.'s serious drinking problem was uncovered, evidence included her purchase of 72 bottles of vodka in just one store alone, in just over a year,"" Palin wrote. ""It's reasonable to believe she imbibed elsewhere, too."" We separately checked Palin’s claim in her commentary that Perry was indicted by a grand jury convened by the Travis County district attorney’s office under Lehmberg, finding the statement without factual footing. And was Palin right that Lehmberg, who has said she plans to serve out her term through 2016, bought six dozen bottles of vodka in a little over 12 months? That shopping is reflected in documents submitted as part of a proceeding culminating in a judge’s December 2013 ruling that Lehmberg could remain in her position. According to an Austin American-Statesman news story posted online Dec. 7, 2013, the Travis County attorney, David Escamilla, submitted relevant receipts during the civil trial over whether Lehmberg must step down. The receipts, the story said, indicated Lehmberg bought about 75 bottles of vodka in a 15-month period ending in April 2013; no other details about the purchases were available, the story said.

Gina Raimondo says her former company helped create more than 1,000 jobs
","In her  ""Back To Work"" campaign ad, General Treasurer Gina Raimondo, one of four Democrats running for governor, stated that her former venture capital firm, Point Judith Capital, helped create more than 1,000 jobs when she was partner. She made the same claim while campaigning for treasurer in the 2010 election. (Raimondo left the firm the day she took office; her investments there are held in a blind trust. The company has been relocated to Boston.) The ad shows Raimondo at Nabsys, a biomedical company in Providence. ""Before I was State Treasurer, my Rhode Island business helped create over 1,000 jobs, including here at Nabsys, a biomedical company,"" Raimondo said. ""As governor, I’ll use this as a model for how we create manufacturing jobs. I’ll bring colleges and industry together to develop new products in marine science, green technology, and medical devices, and to train our workers to fill those jobs … We need to get Rhode Islanders back to work."" This week, Raimondo reiterated that claim in a new TV ad about how she helped bring back Narragansett Beer, originally brewed in Rhode Island until the brewery closed for good in 1983. (""I helped create over a thousand jobs, from high tech to making beer …"") Before we get started, let’s be clear about one thing. Venture capital firms such as Point Judith are not in the business of creating jobs. Their mission is to make money for their investors -- and themselves. They do so by raising money from entities such as private investors and public pension funds, and then investing it in startup companies, hoping for a big return if those companies take off. If the companies succeed and grow, they add jobs. But that’s not the goal of the venture capitalists. To support her claim, Raimondo sent us a list of 21 companies that Point Judith Capital invested in and how many jobs those investments -- and the company’s efforts -- helped create during the time she was a partner. They add up to 1,063. The list was produced by Point Judith Capital in late 2010, in preparation for her run for treasurer. We also interviewed Raimondo. She described Point Judith Capital’s role as an early-stage investor.   ""Typically, you sit on the board of the company, provide a lot of hand-holding and strategic advice, you help recruit people, and get the bank loan. It’s hands-on. That’s why we say ""helped create’"" those jobs. ""We had to have invested money in the company, which means we had an ownership stake in the company … In every case we either had a board seat and additionally were just very involved in building the business, writing the business plan, helping to get customers.   Raimondo said, ""In these cases, we invested millions of dollars."" Initially she said that was ""more than two million in each of those companies."" On Wednesday, Raimondo campaign manager Eric Hyers said Raimondo had misspoke. The investments were all at least six figures; they ranged from roughly $400,000 to $2 million or more. Raimondo noted that many of the companies have expanded and added jobs since then. Next, we attempted to call all 21 companies. Many were from out of state. Some had been bought out, and we were unable to reach the principals who worked there when Point Judith Capital was involved. At least one appears to have since closed. Of the representatives of seven companies we reached, all essentially confirmed Raimondo’s claims, representing roughly 480 jobs. In one case, the job number appeared to fall slightly short; in another, a CEO gave Raimondo credit for more than the number of jobs she cited. We spoke with Mark Hellendrung, president of Narragansett Brewing Co. The company is based in Providence. Hellendrung said the beer is now brewed in Rochester, N.Y., Pawcatuck, Conn., Westport, Mass. Test batches have been brewed locally in Rhode Island. Raimondo claimed Point Judith helped create 10 jobs there, and invested more than $1 million. Hellendrung confirmed that Point Judith Capital helped launch the company (which put the famous Narragansett lager beer back on the shelves) with ""slightly less than"" $2 million venture capital nine years ago, and active involvement.   ""We’ve got over 10 full-time people, and routinely we’ve got over 20 part-time people that work promotions and events … It’s been a labor of love and a ton of fun and Gina was very helpful in that process,"" Hellendrung said. We spoke with Michael O’Neil Jr., founder and CEO of GetWellNetwork, a health care technology company headquartered in Maryland. Raimondo claimed Point Judith Capital helped create 121 jobs there. ""She’s totally correct,"" O’Neil said. ""Gina and I met just as the company was getting started. Her leadership helped us get off the ground and helped get hundreds of jobs."" Those included software engineers and project managers; others were on the services side, O’Neil said. Donna Dooley, chief financial officer at MedOptions, said that the 185 jobs that Raimondo credits Point Judith Capital with helping to create ""sounds accurate."" Dooley joined MedOptions in 2011, the year after Raimondo left Point Judith Capital, ""and by then it was about 250"" employees, she said. MedOptions provides behavioral health services in southern New England and the Mid-Atlantic. ""I know that Point Judith Capital and another investment company put money in … I do think it’s fair to say that there was a fair amount of job creation"" at that time, Dooley said. Steven J. Tallarida, cofounder of the former Spirus Medical, said Raimondo ""probably sold herself short"" by listing nine as the number of jobs Point Judith Capital helped create at that medical device company. ""It was probably around 20,"" Tallarida said in a phone interview. Those included research and development, manufacturing and sales jobs. Point Judith Capital invested ""a couple of million."" Raimondo sat on the board, ""and she would give governance on how to do things,"" Tallarida said. (The Massachusetts-based company was sold in 2011 to the Tokyo-based Olympus Corp.)   Genevieve Thiers, who cofounded Sittercity, wrote in an email that Point Judith Capital ""put in $2.5 million and led our Series A round. Due to them and the other $2.5 million … we were able to grow from 20 employees to about 80."" (Raimondo credited her former company with helping to create 80 jobs at Sittercity, a nationwide babysitter-matching website). Thiers added, ""That money did not start the company but it was needed for a pivotal stage in growth."" Thiers has since left the company but remains on the board. Dr. Barrett Bready, Nabsys cofounder and CEO, said in an email that Point Judith Capital ""was the first venture capital firm to invest in the company, and the firm has continued to invest in subsequent financing rounds."" Raimondo formerly held a board seat. Nabsys currently has 40 employees: the number Raimondo credits her former company with helping to create.

Lentz wrote, ""It’s been a few years but the numbers sound right."" (PermissionTV has been relaunched as VisibleGains). Our ruling: Gina Raimondo said her former firm, Point Judith Capital, helped create more than 1,000 jobs when she was a partner there. She produced a list of 21 companies and a precise number of jobs. We reached representatives of seven companies -- most of them cofounders and/or CEOs. They confirmed that Point Judith capital invested several million dollars - give or take - in each case; held board positions and as such, helped create jobs. The jobs numbers added to roughly 480 at those companies. While we were unable to reach all the companies Raimondo listed, the responses from the companies we did reach supported her qualified claim that Point Judith ""helped create"" 1,000 jobs.

In Arkansas Senate race, Crossroads GPS accuses Mark Pryor of wanting to raise the retirement age
","The idea of raising the retirement age is popping up in one of the nation’s hottest Senate races -- and not in a positive way. Crossroads GPS, a Republican-aligned group, has launched a television ad in the race between incumbent Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark., and his Republican challenger, Rep. Tom Cotton. A portion of the ad says, ""Arkansas seniors depend on Social Security and Medicare. It’s troubling that Sen. Mark Pryor said we should overhaul Social Security and Medicare. On Social Security, Pryor suggested raising the retirement age."" The ad then cuts to a 2011 interview of Pryor saying, ""... say that they couldn’t get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69."" Greg Sargent, author of the Washington Post’s liberal Plum Line blog, noticed the truncated sentence in the video clip, which suggested the ad’s creators had removed some context from the interview with Pryor. Sargent flagged this to PolitiFact in a tweet, and we thought it deserved a look.  The interview excerpted in the ad was conducted by Jerry Westmoreland of KTSS-TV, an Ion Television affiliate based in Bill Clinton’s birthplace of Hope, Ark. In the interview, Pryor was talking about some of the long-term funding challenges Social Security faces: ""Social Security is another thing that’s not in any of the budgets right now, but it is very, very fixable. And again, if people get serious about this in Washington, we can fix Social Security next week if we wanted to. It's not that hard to do, especially if we start right now, because Social Security is solvent for about 25 years. So if you make small changes now, you have 25 years for those little changes to accumulate over time and really help. You could pretty easily make Social Security solvent in perpetuity. Probably the biggest change would be to take my kids’ generation -- teenagers today -- and life expectancy is longer etc., and probably say that they couldn’t get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69. If you just did that one change, you’d fix about 80 percent of it."" The Pryor campaign, in a written response to the ad, said that the senator ""has never voted to raise the Social Security retirement age,"" and even in the context of the interview, he doesn’t say that a retirement-age hike is his official policy stance. We found no evidence to contradict those assertions by the Pryor campaign -- but it’s important to note that the ad didn’t make either of those claims. It simply said that Pryor ""suggested raising the retirement age."" Because the full KTSS interview makes that much clear, the ad does contains a grain of truth. However, the Crossroads GPS ad glosses over -- indeed, actively edits away -- some important context. Specifically, in the KTSS interview, Pryor limits his suggestion to raising the retirement age for his ""kids’ generation -- teenagers today."" For an ad whose narration directly addresses ""Arkansas seniors"" -- and that only includes images of seniors, without showing any teenagers -- that’s a crucial omission. Crossroads GPS did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Our ruling The Crossroads GPS ad said that while ""Arkansas seniors depend on Social Security and Medicare,"" Pryor supports an overhaul by which they ""couldn’t get Social Security until they turn 68 or 69."" The ad has a point that ""Pryor suggested raising the retirement age"" in the KTSS interview. However, the ad is explicitly directed toward ""Arkansas seniors,"" and through selective editing of the KTSS interview, Crossroads GPS omits a clear and important qualifier Pryor had made, that any future hike in the retirement age would be for his ""kids’ generation -- teenagers today."" The claim contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/20/crossroads-gps/arkansas-senate-race-crossroads-gps-accuses-mark-p/

Limbaugh: MSNBC 'went off air' after news that Michael Brown was a suspect in Ferguson robbery
","Knowledge of Michael Brown’s alleged involvement in a convenience store robbery before he was killed by police changed the entire narrative of Ferguson, Mo., but the ""drive-by-media"" couldn’t handle it, according to Rush Limbaugh. On Aug. 15, Ferguson Police Chief Tom Jackson released the name of the officer who shot Brown, six-year force veteran Darren Wilson, as well as a video allegedly showing Brown stealing a box of cigars from a convenience store minutes before he was shot. These details reveal the media-spun racial profiling tragedy as a simple episode of cops and robbers, Limbaugh said on his show on the same day. And in typical drive-by-media fashion, he said, reporters rushed to spread lies when the news broke and were just as quick to exit when the facts emerged. ""MSNBC went to paid programming while they had editorial conferences to figure out how to deal with this!"" Limbaugh said, and emphasized the point later in his program. ""MSNBC, like I said, practically went off the air for a while to have behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with this new revelation."" We wondered did MSNBC interrupt their programming for an extended commercial break after the details of Brown’s theft were released? Pressing matters  We should note that the timeline of the revelations is fragmented. Information was released incrementally during three press conferences on Aug. 15. In the first press conference, which lasted from 9:43 to 9:47 a.m. Eastern Time, Ferguson police chief Jackson revealed Wilson’s name, gave a timeline of the events surrounding the shooting and robbery and announced he would take no questions. Members of the media received documents on the case and still images from surveillance footage of the robbery in press packets. The police report said that ""Brown is the primary suspect in the robbery,"" and Jackson’s comments seemed to suggest that the encounter between Brown and Wilson was related to the robbery. Later that afternoon, the entire video of the robbery was released, around the time of a separate press conference held by Capt. Ron Johnson of the Missouri State Highway Patrol and Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon. Johnson expressed his frustration at the Ferguson police’s handling of the case. That press conference lasted from 12:09 p.m  to 12:45 p.m. Eastern. As for the surveillance video Jackson alluded to in his morning briefing, the exact timing of the full footage release is unclear, with dissonance between the three major cable networks. To the best of our knowledge, the St. Louis Post-Dispatch was one of the first -- if not, the first -- news outlet to air the video at noon Eastern. MSNBC led with the footage minutes later on Andrea Mitchell, after the show began at noon. Fox News aired it 40 minutes later. On CNN’s Wolf, reporter Don Lemon said at 1:13 p.m. that the network still didn’t have the tape in its hands. By 1:25 p.m., host Wolf Blitzer said CNN had the tape but is ""vetting it before we put it on air."" In a later press conference from 3:05 p.m. to 3:14 p.m., Jackson clarified that Wilson did not know Brown was a suspect in the robbery case when he stopped the 18-year-old. Jackson also said that the matter is under investigation and that he released the documents because of Freedom of Information requests. Timeline of coverage Using a software called Critical Mention, we found when the three major cable news networks released the materials related to Brown’s death and robbery and when they went to commercial break on Aug.15. Here’s a timeline (all times Eastern):   MSNBC CNN Fox News The Daily Rundown 9:43 a.m.: Ferguson police press conference 9:57 a.m.: Program ends, commercial break José Díaz-Balart 10:42 a.m: Still images from surveillance tape shown 10:47 a.m.: Commercial break Andrea Mitchell Reports 12:03 p.m.: Full video shown 12:09 p.m.: Missouri State Highway Patrol and Governor press conference 12:57 p.m.: Program ends, commercial break The Cycle 3:05 p.m.: Ferguson police press conference 3:27 p.m.: Commercial break CNN Newsroom 9:43 a.m.: Ferguson police press conference 9:52 a.m.: Commercial break 10:07 a.m.: Still images of surveillance tape shown 10:17 a.m.: Commercial break Legal View 12:09 p.m.: Missouri State Highway Patrol and Governor press conference No commercial break Wolf 1:43 p.m.: Full video shown 1:47 p.m.: Commercial break CNN Newsroom 3:05 p.m.: Ferguson police press conference 3:19 p.m.: Commercial break America’s Newsroom 9:43 a.m.: Ferguson police press conference 9:51 a.m.: Commercial break 10:10 a.m.: Still images of surveillance tape shown 10:14 a.m.: Commercial break Outnumbered 12:09 p.m.: Missouri State Highway Patrol  and Governor press conference 12:43 p.m. Full video shown 12:48 p.m.: Commercial break Shepard Smith Reporting 3:05 p.m.: Ferguson police press conference 3:14 p.m.: Press conference ends, commercial break   As you can see, MSNBC was actually the first of the three cable networks to show the full video of Brown in the convenience store. It also aired all three press conferences that day, and for longer than either CNN or Fox News. There were no longer-than-usual commercial breaks and certainly no extended commercials or infomercials as Limbaugh's comments suggest. In fact, MSNBC was on air for 54 straight minutes after first airing the surveillance video. The ruling Limbaugh said, ""MSNBC practically went off the air for a while to have behind-closed-doors meetings to figure out how to deal with this new revelation,"" rolling paid advertising in lieu of programming. The release of information by the Ferguson police in the morning left Brown’s ties to the robbery unclear. Still MSNBC did not go to commercial break immediately. Nor did it go to break after showing frames from the video police alluded to. And certainly MSNBC never aired an extended commerical or infomercial as Limbaugh's statements suggest. Though when exactly the entire surveillance video was released is hard to say, MSNBC was one of the first news outlets to air it. After, MSNBC did not go to commercial break and had pundits discuss the video on air until a live press conference began.

Obamacare won't let Florida regulate health insurance, state GOP says
","Health insurers want to raise rates in 2015, Florida’s regulatory agency is largely powerless to stop it, and the Republican Party of Florida wants you to believe it’s all the federal government’s fault. By extension, the state GOP implies Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist is worth some blame, too, since he’s come out in support of the law. During a Facebook Q&A on Aug. 6, someone asked Crist if he planned on reinstating the state insurance commissioner’s power to renegotiate 2015 rates in time to affect how much those rates cost. ""Absolutely,"" Crist replied. ""The fact that we have a law on the books under Rick Scott that says the Office of Insurance Regulation can't regulate insurance is astounding. We deserve better, you deserve better."" But the state Republican Party was quick to contradict Crist, making the first comment on that response. ""Wrong, Charlie,"" the GOP’s Facebook account wrote. ""It's Obamacare that prevents OIR (the Office of Insurance Regulation) from regulating insurance … a law that you think is great even though premiums will go up by double digits for Floridians."" So who’s right? Does Obamacare keep Florida’s insurance regulator from regulating insurance? We’re not going to make you fill out dozens of forms in triplicate to find out, because we’ve got you covered. Regulating the regulators PolitiFact Florida has looked at a version of this claim before, when Florida’s Democratic members of Congress complained in a letter to the U.S. Health and Human Services Department. The letter -- dated Aug. 1, 2013, authored by U.S. Rep Ted Deutch and signed by all 10 of the state’s Democratic representatives -- asked the federal government to protect Florida consumers, because the state Legislature had prevented Insurance Commissioner Kevin McCarty from being able to ""negotiate lower rates with companies or refuse rates that are too high."" We rated the statement True. What’s that all about? In May 2013, Scott signed Senate Bill 1842, a law that suspended for the next two years the requirement that insurers get state approval for rates for new plans. The bill took away McCarty’s power to negotiate rates or refuse rates deemed too high. Insurance companies still had to file rate changes with the state, but could institute those changes without approval. The bill was in response to 2010’s Affordable Care Act, which said state law had to follow minimum federal guidelines for insurance plans. These guidelines included things like requiring that pre-existing conditions be covered, and protections against gender bias. The health care law also required insurance companies to justify unreasonable rate increases, defined as more than 10 percent year over year. The Legislature decided that if the federal government wanted a say over policy premiums, then they could go ahead and regulate it themselves. Republicans passed SB 1842 largely along party lines, with Scott writing, ""I support the Legislature's deference to the federal government. ... Rates for the new plans will be reviewed by the same federal government that will be enforcing and updating new rules and regulations throughout this very fluid and uncertain transition period."" Unfortunately, the Affordable Care Act doesn’t give the federal government power to regulate insurance rates. It defers to states to regulate their premiums, following a set of criteria for state agencies. There are five states that don’t meet the standards of having effective rate review programs -- Alabama, Missouri, Oklahoma, Texas and Wyoming. Those states don’t empower commissioners to regulate premiums. Ironically, the Republican Party of Florida told us it was referring directly to the portion of the Affordable Care Act that says state law is to be followed unless it contradicts the federal health care law, and that’s why Obamacare makes the insurance commissioner obsolete when it comes to setting rates. Experts we talked to said that doesn’t mean Washington can or wants to do Florida’s job. ""If a state doesn’t have rate review authority, then no one really has the power to review them,"" Washington and Lee University law professor Timothy Jost, who supports the law, told us. ""If Florida can’t do it, then no one can."" Jost said the federal government does have some power over insurers in Florida. It can ask insurance companies to explain those so-called unreasonable rates, then deny the companies the ability to sell in that state if the government chooses. The company would have to disclose to policyholders and potential customers it had been reviewed for unreasonable rates, an undesirable distinction. The ACA also has a provision requiring at least 80 percent or 85 percent of premiums on medical care, or pay rebates to customers. But that’s not the same kind of power that a state has to regulate health insurance directly, he said. Florida is unique in its unwillingness to let what the federal government considers an effective regulatory agency to do its own job, according to Greg Mellowe, director of health research and analysis at the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, a consumer health advocacy group. ""The intent of Obamacare was to keep states in charge of regulating insurance,"" Mellowe said. ""Instead, the Legislature changed state law to take away Florida’s rate review."" Washington even offers states grants to assist in strengthening rate review powers, a program in which Florida has refused to participate. We rated a statement from Sen. Bill Nelson about whether Scott gave the $1 million grant back and found it Mostly True. For 2015, 14 insurance companies have filed plans for rate increases averaging 13.2 percent, although three companies said their rates would go down next year. While those are preliminary proposals and will in all likelihood change, the state has no power to negotiate to lower the premiums until next year, thanks to the 2013 law Republicans overwhelmingly supported. The U.S. Health and Human Services Department points to states like New York and Oregon as examples of states that actively keep premiums low through rate reviews. Since 2010, other states have started or are planning to enact stronger insurance regulations to enforce Obamacare rules. Both Louisiana and Montana have joined the effective rate review list in the last four years, and Iowa, Pennsylvania and Virginia have expanded regulatory powers over certain types of coverage. Californians this fall will vote on strengthening their elected insurance commissioner’s powers to regulate rates, with 70 percent of voters backing the initiative. Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said Obamacare ""prevents (Florida) from regulating insurance."" That’s not at all the case. The Affordable Care Act says if states can regulate premiums, they should. States only have to bring laws up to minimum Obamacare requirements. The federal government only intervenes in states that don’t have effective rate review programs -- something Florida can do on its own but won’t, thanks to the 2013 law passed by the Republican-led Legislature. The state GOP not only misrepresented the terms of the Affordable Care Act, but it also implied the Democratic president’s signature law was to blame for the state’s (temporary) regulatory woes. It was mostly Republican lawmakers who spearheaded that change to Florida law, after the state rejected a $1 million federal grant to help improve the process. Most other states regulate insurance rates without the difficulty the Republican Party of Florida claimed.

John Oliver says Keene, N.H., officials wanted armored vehicle to thwart terrorism at pumpkin fest
","With protests continuing in Ferguson, Mo., following the shooting of an unarmed teenager, police have rolled out an arsenal of weapons, vehicles and riot gear to help quell any unrest in the St. Louis suburb. While local officials say they’re trying to maintain safety and protect property, the sight of police officers in combat gear has sparked a national conversation about whether the police need to be outfitted with military-grade equipment. HBO television host John Oliver took aim at the militarization of civilian police forces in his Sunday night show, Last Week Tonight, that aired August 17. Oliver said federal funding for anti-terrorism efforts has been doled out on such a massive scale that even Keene -- with fewer than 30,000 residents -- secured a military-grade truck for its police department. ""This has happened on such a scale that it’s enabled small towns like Keene, N.H., to apply for a BearCat, a military-grade armored personnel truck, which they needed because, as their application argued, ‘the terrorism threat is far-reaching and often unforeseen,’ and cited as a possible target their annual Pumpkin Festival."" He mused that the armored vehicle would be an effective deterrent for pumpkin smashers. ""Good luck easily out-maneuvering that, teenagers with baseball bats!"" he said. We wondered whether Oliver was playing straight with the facts, even as he played the episode for laughs. Did the Keene Police Department really cite a terrorism threat at the Pumpkin Festival when it asked for federal money? We checked with Oliver’s staff, but they’re on a two-week break and unable to respond. First, some background on the Pumpkin Festival. It’s held each year in October and draws as many as 70,000 people to downtown Keene. It is best known for the city’s ongoing attempts to set the world record for the most lit jack-o’-lanterns in one place. So what does an iconic New England fall festival have to do with armored vehicles and terrorism? Keene’s city council accepted a federal grant in 2012 to purchase the armored personnel carrier, named a ""BearCat"" by its manufacturer. At the time, a city councilor called the $285,933 vehicle a ""poster child of waste."" The BearCat hit the streets on Nov. 20, 2012, after a contentious debate among Keene residents about its necessity. Funding came from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security through a grant managed by the New Hampshire Department of Safety. During public meetings leading up to the purchase, it appears there was little conversation about the threat of terrorism in southern New Hampshire. The discussion centered mainly around how the vehicle would be deployed during routine law enforcement procedures, such as evacuating residents during a flood or policing the campus of Keene State College. ""The original reason for filing the grant application was to acquire the piece of equipment in case there was some kind of crisis -- some kind of emergency that required the use of that type of equipment,"" said Keene Mayor Kendall Lane, who was serving on the city council at the time. He said in his recollection, the BearCat has been deployed only twice since it was acquired. In both instances, police were dealing with potentially armed subjects. Lane said Keene didn't cite the Pumpkin Fest as the only reason to get the BearCat, and for that reason, he believes Oliver’s bit was a little misleading. ""It was humorous, but you know, the implication was that the Pumpkin Fest attracts a few hundred people in a rural part of America that would never be subject to a terrorist act. It was humorous. It was funny, but it was miscast."" By our reading, though, Oliver is correct that the Keene Police Department’s written application for federal funds focused mainly on terrorism -- aligning with the aims of the Department of Homeland Security. Keene’s Pumpkin Festival is among several annual events that draw large crowds and are ""susceptible to terrorist attacks,"" the application states. Keene Police Chief Kenneth Meola also mentioned the threat of terrorism during a meeting with Keene State College students in February 2012. ""Do I think al-Qaeda is going to target Pumpkin Fest? No, but are there fringe groups that want to make a statement? Yes, and we should prepare for that,"" he said. ""It is a target in the New Hampshire region."" Jim Massery, government sales manager for the Massachusetts company that manufactures the vehicles, also alluded to the threat of terrorism during an interview with Huffington Post. ""We don’t know what the terrorists are thinking,"" said Massery, of Lenco Armored Vehicles. ""No one predicted that terrorists would take over airplanes on Sept. 11. If a group of terrorists decide to shoot up a shopping mall in a town like Keene, wouldn't you rather be prepared?"" While the Department of Homeland Security perceived a significant enough threat in Keene to authorize funds for the BearCat, Oliver isn’t the only commentator who has second-guessed the decision. U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., a member of the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs, detailed Keene's vehicle purchase in his 2012 report on misguided and wasteful spending in terror-prevention grant programs. The American Civil Liberties Union also devoted a section of its comprehensive June 2014 report on the militarization of American police departments to Keene’s BearCat. ""Not even Keene city officials believed that the city actually needed the BearCat to thwart terrorism,"" the ACLU report reads. ""To explain why the police included the word ‘terrorism’ on their application for federal funding for this purchase, a city council member said, ‘Our application talked about the danger of domestic terrorism, but that’s just something you put in the grant application to get the money. What red-blooded American cop isn’t going to be excited about getting a toy like this? That’s what it comes down to.’"" Our ruling Oliver said the Keene Police Department cited its annual Pumpkin Festival as a potential target for terrorism when it applied for grant money to buy an armored personnel truck. Keene’s mayor says the city had a variety of reasons for seeking the BearCat, but Oliver was correct to state that the city cited the Pumpkin Festival as a possible target for terrorists.

Conservative group claims Michigan Senate candidate Gary Peters hasn't done anything in Congress
","A group founded by conservative billionaire Joe Ricketts, who spent millions to help Republican Mitt Romney in 2012, is on the air in Michigan where there’s a heated race to replace retiring Democratic Sen. Carl Levin. Ricketts’ group, Ending Spending Action Fund, launched an ad Aug. 13 that attacks the record of Rep. Gary Peters, the Michigan Democrat hoping to succeed Levin. Peters is running against Republican Terri Lynn Land, former Michigan Secretary of State. ""Can you think of a single thing he’s accomplished?"" a narrator asks in the 30-second spot. A clock ticks. ""In six years, Peters introduced zero bills that became law."" We decided to see if that’s accurate. Peters was elected in 2008. In that time, he has sponsored 49 bills. A quick search found that four of them passed the House, but none of them made it through the Senate and onto President Barack Obama’s desk.  In the past we’ve found that experts are critical of such a narrow measure of legislative success, noting that it hardly captures a lawmaker’s effectiveness or track record for moving legislation. Lawmaking is a collaborative process, so sometimes many people contribute even though only one person is listed as the original sponsor. A deeper dive into Peters’ tenure finds several legislative victories that fly in the face of the ad’s claim. On June 9, Obama signed into law H.R. 724, an act ""to amend the Clean Air Act to remove the requirement for dealer certification of new light-duty motor vehicles."" Basically, the certificate required for these new vehicles was duplicative, since laws already required these standards to be met during production, thus creating red tape for these dealers. While the bill’s listed sponsor is Rep. Robert Latta, R-Ohio, Peters was widely recognized for his contributions to the bill. Multiple reports indicated that he co-wrote it with Latta, and Peters was listed as the lone ""original co-sponsor"" of the bill. Latta’s website even says that he ""along with Congressman Gary Peters introduced"" the legislation. In 2010, Peters sponsored a bill he called the State Small Business Credit Initiative. The bill did not pass the House as standalone legislation. But during the markup of the Small Business Lending Fund Act of 2010 (later called the Small Business Jobs Act) in the House Financial Services Committee on May 19, 2010, Peters offered an amendment to incorporate his bill into the larger legislation. It was approved on 39-23 vote. So essentially, when Obama signed the Small Business Jobs Act, he was also signing Peters’ bill into law. Indeed, Peters’ profile on Congressional Quarterly notes he keeps a pen from Obama’s bill signing in his office, as Peters ""was the author of an amendment that created a collateral support program for small businesses struggling to get loans because the capital they owned had decreased in value during the recession."" Peters also introduced the Animal Torture Prevention Act of 2010. The bill came in response to a Supreme Court ruling that said an existing law against so-called animal crush videos that show animals being abused was too broad and may violate First Amendment rights. While Peters’ bill did not pass, a similar bill did. Peters’ bill is listed as a ""related bill"" on Congress’ bill-tracking service because it is ""a companion measure, an identical bill, a procedurally-related measure, or one with substantive similarities,"" according to Congress.gov. Peters has also co-sponsored 44 bills that eventually became law, and was listed as an ""original co-sponsor"" on five of them. Not all of those bills are significant, nor did he play a significant role in crafting all of them. But within the walls of Congress, he can at least claim partial victory. Those examples don’t include committee work where Peters took part in shaping bills that would later become law. For example, Peters served on the powerful Wall Street Reform Conference Committee that produced the final version of Dodd-Frank, the bill that emerged in the aftermath of the recession and ensuing bailouts. Our ruling The Ending Spending ad claims that Peters hasn't accomplished anything, making this statement: ""In six years, Peters introduced zero bills that became law."" If you search congressional databases, you won't find a bill introduced solely by Peters that became law. But we found several instances in which Peters was credited with writing the legislation that did become law, sponsoring a bill that became part of a larger package signed by Obama, offering a bill similar to one that became law, or was an original co-sponsor.  There’s a shred of truth in the claim by Ending Spending, but it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False. Update: After we published this piece, we heard from Brian Baker, president of Ending Spending Action Fund. Baker pointed to the evidence (which is included in our fact-check) that Peters was not sole sponsor on any bill that became law and stood by the group’s claim. ""First, it is great that PolitiFact acknowledges, as it must, that ‘if you search congressional databases, you won’t find a bill introduced solely by Peters that became law.’ This sentence confirms the truth of the central assertion in our advertisement,"" Baker said. We stand by our original analysis and keep the rating the same at Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2014/aug/20/ending-spending-action-fund/conservative-group-claims-michigan-senate-candidat/

Neil Patrick Harris Heineken ad: We can't drink on TV
","For all the fun you see people having in beer commercials, the one thing you won’t see is someone actually drinking beer. The Dutch brewer Heineken made this the centerpiece of an ad campaign that features the popular actor Neil Patrick Harris. In this version, Harris is touting the taste of Heineken Light. The video shoot jolts to a halt when Harris tips a bottle to take a sip only to find that the cap is still on. This exchange between Harris and the director follows: Director: ""Cut! Neil, you can’t drink the Heineken Light. Just hold it up."" Harris: ""What do you mean? Why can’t I drink it?"" Director: ""There are rules about drinking in the commercial."" Harris: "" ‘Cause it’s airing during a children’s program or something."" Director: ""No."" Harris: ""Then why?"" Director: ""It’s a regulatory thing. We can’t actually show you drinking Heineken Light on camera."" It’s actually a pretty funny ad as Harris gamely and utterly misses the director’s point But we wondered about the director’s claim that a ""regulatory thing"" stops people from drinking beer in commercials. We’ve seen plenty of beer commercials and just always assumed that someone was drinking at some point. The fact is, however, ad makers successfully are getting us to see more than is on screen. In case you were wondering, it’s not the long arm of government that’s stopping people from a sip of sudsy brew. A press officer at the Federal Communications Commission, the body in charge of decency and other rules for broadcasters, said FCC rules are silent on drinking on camera. ""Congress has not enacted any law prohibiting broadcast advertising of any kind of alcoholic beverage, and the FCC does not have a rule or policy regulating such advertisements,"" she said, citing the agency’s website. If there’s an iron fist, it belongs to the broadcasters. Tara Rush, senior director of corporate communications at Heineken USA, said the rules come from TV networks. ""This is a regulation with the actual TV networks,"" Rush said. ""It’s a long-standing rule."" The broadcasters’ trade group, the National Association of Broadcasters, has no policy itself, but a spokesman sent us articles that describe how each network is free to set its own standards and, as it stands, when it comes to beer, they frown on public displays of ingestion. A spokeswoman for The Beer Institute, the voice of brewers, told us their members are loath to take chances with network policy. ""If you’re putting an ad together, you will be as conservative as possible so you know it will get past all the networks,"" said Megan Kirkpatrick, director of communications at the Institute. Kirkpatrick said the brewers have no desire to stir things up and risk stirring a cry for a new law. ""The fact that it is self-regulated now, that’s not something brewers would want to put in jeopardy,"" Kirkpatrick said. ""It’s the way they have operated for decades. You show a lot of people enjoying a football game or enjoying a baseball game but you don’t show any consumption. I don't think you’re going to see that change."" Perhaps.

GOP chair correct; Carter voted for 3 of 4 Deal budgets
","Education. It’s the single biggest expense in the state budget (This year alone, the cost of k-12 education is $7.9 billion, or 43.4 percent of the state’s $18.3 billion budget). And it’s one of the biggest issues in this year’s closely watched governor’s race. On Aug. 12, Republicans issued a statement attacking Jason Carter, the Democratic state senator who is hoping to wrestle the job of governor from Republican Nathan Deal. Sonny Perdue, Deal’s predecessor, in 2003 became Georgia’s first Republican governor since Reconstruction. The GOP now controls the Georgia House, Senate and all major statewide offices. Democrats see Carter, a two-term state senator from the Decatur area and former President Jimmy Carter’s grandson, as their best chance for regaining a foothold. ""How can Carter criticize Gov. Deal for 'underfunding' education when he backed three of (Deal’s) budgets?"" John Padgett, chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said in the press release. The release goes on to accuse Carter, 39, of playing politics -- voting for Deal’s first three state budgets, but against Deal’s last budget after announcing as a candidate for governor. All four budgets included major, so-called austerity cuts to education. ""He (Carter) thinks that with enough rhetoric he can hide the fact that he cares more about advancing his own career than improving the education system in Georgia,"" Padgett said in the statement. The party chair is parroting a claim that Deal’s campaign has been making. PolitiFact decided it was time to fact-check Carter’s voting record on the state budgets. Carter has voiced concerns about the state’s commitment to public education during most of his short Senate career. His criticism, specifically of Deal on education, has sharpened in recent months, with his campaign manager at one point calling Deal Georgia’s worst education governor. (See PolitiFact’s Pants On Fire ruling of that claim.) For our current fact check, we started at the General Assembly website, where the votes of lawmakers on all bills -- including state budgets -- are public. We confirmed that Carter voted ""Yes"" with the majority in the Senate for Deal’s fiscal 2012, 2013 and 2014 budgets. Austerity cuts to education in each of those budgets exceeded $1 billion. In this year’s General Assembly session, only four out of 56 state senators voted against the 2015 budget. Gubernatorial candidate Carter cast one of those ""No"" votes. Austerity cuts were part of the 2015 budget. But at $747 million, they were the smallest since 2009 and, as such, viewed as largely positive by leaders in education. --------------------------------------------------- Austerity Cuts to K-12 education 2011-2015 2011           $1,089,521,696 2012           $1,147,859,436 2013           $1,143,762,797 2014            $1,061,127,407 2015            $746,769,852 Total 2003-2015 $8,436,724,814 Source: Allotment sheets, Georgia Department of Education Since 2003, governors and lawmakers haven’t fully funded schools based on the state’s education funding formula. These austerity cuts have totaled $8.4 billion, according to reports filed with the Georgia Department of Education. In combination with plummeting property tax collections -- fallout from the national housing market collapse -- the austerity cuts have thrown many of the state’s 180 school systems into a tailspin. As a result, there have been staff reductions, unpaid furlough days, larger class sizes and, in many cases, shorter school years. Carter has explained his decision to vote this year against Deal’s budget. At one of his back-to-back school tours last week, the Democrat said the 2015 funding boost was election-year politicking to mask the governor’s ""dismantling"" of public education. ""The governor on average has underfunded our schools by $1 billion each year, and the claim that they have done enough is just not true,"" Carter said. ""The $750 million shortfall into the education fund this year is not something I support."" He would not comment about his three prior votes for Deal’s budget when contacted by PolitiFact. In an email, Bryan Thomas, Carter’s spokesman, reiterated many of the candidate’s past criticisms of Deal’s handling of k-12 education, as well as the popular HOPE scholarship program. ""Governor Deal has shortchanged our schools by an average of $1 billion a year since taking office,"" Thomas said. ""He likes to brag about his election-year budget, but he still missed the mark by more than $750 million."" In November, Thomas said, voters can choose ""between a governor who only seems to care about schools in an election year, or Jason, whose commitment to our schools has never wavered."" (State education funding has increased during Deal's tenure, in part due to enrollment growth. Budget reports show K-12 spending has increased from $7.067 billion when he took office to $7.94 billion this year.) Carter, who was member of a special Senate task force on education in 2012, has said, if elected governor, he would push to create a separate education budget that would be tantamount to an untouchable trust fund for schools. In summary, John Padgett, GOP state chairman, was correct. Jason Carter voted in favor of three of Gov. Nathan Deal’s state budgets that each included $1 billion-plus in austerity cuts to education. Carter voted this year against a fourth, annual state budget proposed by Deal that included about $747 million in austerity cuts to K-12 education, the smallest cut since 2009.

Scott Walker says union reform law that brought massive protests has saved taxpayers $3 billion
","Scott Walker’s signature accomplishment as governor, the Act 10 collective bargaining reform law, curtailed the powers of public employee unions, reduced the take-home pay of most public workers and caused months of protests in Madison. In a July 21, 2014 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Walker defended the three-year-old law, and made a claim that he’s already begun to repeat ahead of the November general election. ""I support our Act 10 reforms,"" he said, ""because they saved the taxpayers some $3 billion."" Walker has long been touting how the state and local governments have used the ""tools"" in the law to reduce spending on pensions and health benefits for public employees. But Act 10 wasn’t a tax cut. So have taxpayers really saved some $3 billion? Billions and billions We’ve heard from Walker before about billions in savings. In March 2014, he claimed that once his Blueprint for Prosperity plan was signed into law, ""we will have delivered $2 billion"" in tax relief -- a claim we rated True. But that statement was about tax measures that have or will come about as a result of actions taken during Walker’s four-year term. The new claim refers to taxpayer savings as a result of Act 10. The law requires most state and local government employees to pay a larger share of the cost of their pension and health benefits -- which is where Walker’s claim of savings to taxpayers comes in. There was never a question that the financial impact would be large. In criticizing the law, the liberal Institute for Wisconsin’s Future said in December 2011 that the higher benefit contributions would cost public employees $700 million per year in take-home pay. And public employees, of course, are taxpayers, too. Pension contributions Pension savings make up the lion's share of Walker's claim. All state employees and nearly all local government employees participate in the state pension system. Only the City of Milwaukee and Milwaukee County run pension systems separate from the state. For years in the state system, state government and municipalities paid not only the employer share of pension contributions but -- primarily due to collective bargaining -- essentially all of the employee contributions. Act 10 requires that for most public employees, pension contributions be split equally between employees and employers. Contribution rates are adjusted each year, based on investment returns and other factors. For 2015, the rates are 6.8 percent of salary for most public employees and 7.7 percent for elected and executive employees. In other words, under Act 10, most public employees contribute 6.8 percent of their salaries for their pensions and their employers contribute the same amount. Walker puts the pension savings at $2.35 billion -- $1.56 billion from local government employees, plus $794.8 million from state employees (including those working for the University of Wisconsin System). That’s his tally for how much employees have contributed to their pensions from the time Act 10 took effect in 2011 through 2014, with the figure for 2014 being an estimate. We obtained figures from the state Department of Employee Trust Funds. They show $1.59 billion in state and local government employee pension contributions from 2011 through 2013. And, more than half way through 2014, the department expects the 2014 employee contributions to be at or slightly above the $761 million they were in 2013. So, even if the employee contributions in 2014 turn out to be the same as in 2013, the total savings to taxpayers would be $1.59 billion plus $761 million, or a total of $2.35 billion -- the same total Walker claims. But it bears repeating -- it isn’t as though those pension costs disappeared. Rather, they were transferred from taxpayers as a whole to public employees. Health insurance  The next-largest Act 10 savings cited by Walker is from health insurance. It’s similar to pension savings in that public employees are picking up a greater share of the cost, easing the burden on general taxpayers. Act 10 requires most public employees to pay at least 12 percent of their premiums, which translated into a big increase for many employees and a savings for state and local governments. In addition, Act 10 gives public employers flexibility to change benefits, which can also result in additional savings for the unit of government involved. Walker says school districts statewide saved $200 million in health insurance costs just in 2011-’12, the first year after Act 10. That calculation comes from the nonpartisan Wisconsin Taxpayers Alliance. Dale Knapp, the group’s research director, told us the figure is conservative. Meanwhile, Walker says state government has saved $482 million on health insurance savings as a result of the higher employee premium contributions and changes made to health coverage -- $264 million for 2012 and 2013, plus $218 million for 2014 and 2015. He cited figures the State Budget Office uses to help create the state budget. The $200 million in school district health insurance savings plus the $482 million in state savings equals $682 million in health savings. Added to the $2.35 billion in pension savings makes $3.03 billion in total savings. The figures don’t take into account health insurance savings seen by municipalities, nor health savings seen by school districts after the first year of Act 10, so the actual number would be higher. Knapp said he’s not aware of any savings calculations for municipalities. Moreover, there is anecdotal evidence of other savings throughout the state. For example, a Milwaukee Public Schools actuarial report in 2012 said Act 10 enabled the school district to shave $1 billion from its long-term benefit obligations to retirees. MPS used the law to raise eligibility requirements for retirement benefits other than pension and changed the design of health care plans. Similarly, we found in a previous Act 10 factcheck that the law saved Milwaukee County $22 million in pension and health benefits in 2012, although that didn’t fully offset a reduction in state aid. That leads to an important point before we close.   The Act 10 savings aren’t a dollar-for-dollar a tax cut for taxpayers. Rather, they are savings in the context of a budget and what would otherwise be spent for a particular purpose or program. Indeed, Walker himself has often said that easing the employee benefits burden on state and local governments has given them flexibility -- whether that’s using the savings for property tax relief, shifting money to other spending or offsetting cuts in state aid.    Our rating Walker says his ""Act 10 reforms"" have ""saved the taxpayers some $3 billion."" Requiring most state and local government employees to contribute more to their pensions has saved public employers more than $3 billion, including $2.35 billion in pension costs, and there are more savings that haven’t fully been tallied. Those costs haven’t simply been eliminated, however. They’ve been taken on by public employees, who are also taxpayers.

New York state Democrat's TV ad challenges GOP congressman over raising the retirement age
","The possibility that Congress could cut back on Social Security has long been a potent weapon in the campaign ad wars. Recently, the theme emerged again in a congressional race in western New York state. It came up in a television ad created by Martha Robertson, a Democratic Tompkins County legislator who is challenging the Republican incumbent, Rep. Tom Reed, in New York’s 23rd district, a sprawling region bordering Pennsylvania known as the Southern Tier. Among other things, Robertson’s ad charges that Reed ""voted to raise the Social Security retirement age on us."" Policy experts have long suggested a hike in the retirement age as a way to ease the fiscal and demographic crunch facing the Social Security program. The aging of the baby boomers means that fewer workers will have to support more retirees in the coming years. To remain solvent, the program might need to institute higher taxes, reduced benefits or a later retirement age. However, among elected officials, openly advocating for any of these options is considered the ""third rail"" of politics -- in other words, touch it and you die -- because each policy proposal is so unpopular. This is particularly true among older voters who are reliant on Social Security and who tend to vote at higher-than-average rates. Since most elected officials are on record opposing a higher retirement age, the ad raised our eyebrows. So we took a closer look. On screen, the ad provides a footnote that led us to an alternative budget blueprint offered in 2012 by Rep. Jim Cooper, D-Tenn., and then-Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Ohio. In 2012, Cooper and LaTourette offered a budget based on the final report of the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, better known as the Simpson-Bowles commission, after its co-chairs, former Sen. Alan Simpson, R-Wyo., and former White House chief of staff Erskine Bowles, a Democrat. The Cooper-LaTourette amendment failed by a wide margin in the House -- just 38 lawmakers voted for it, with 382 voting against -- but Reed was one of 16 Republicans who voted for it. However, the accuracy of Robertson’s ad hinges on whether Reed’s vote would have raised ""the Social Security retirement age on us."" To be accurate, the claim relies on the assumption that Reed was, in effect, voting for what was advocated in the Simpson-Bowles final report. And that assumption is murkier than the ad lets on. It’s true that the Simpson-Bowles report did propose raising the Social Security retirement age. Specifically, it said that after the retirement age reaches 67 in 2027 under current law, the age should be indexed for increases in life expectancy. That would mean upping the retirement age to 68 around 2050, and to 69 around 2075. (Using a similar calculation, the Simpson-Bowles proposal would also raise the early-retirement age at which Americans can retire in exchange for smaller monthly benefits.) Robertson’s spokesman, Seth Stein, told PolitiFact, ""Our ad is factual. Congressman Tom Reed has voted for Cooper-LaTourette, which is based on Simpson-Bowles -- and many independent analysts agree that this plan would raise the retirement age."" However, the ad’s claim ignores two important qualifiers. The first is that the proposal Reed actually voted for did not include the Simpson-Bowles language on raising the retirement age. Here’s the language Reed and the other 37 lawmakers did vote for: ""It is the policy of this resolution that Congress should work on a bipartisan basis to make Social Security sustainably solvent over 75 years. … Legislation to ensure sustainable solvency shall reflect the principles and framework outlined in the bipartisan Simpson-Bowles Moment of Truth report and the bipartisan Rivlin-Domenici Restoring America’s Future report, which … include, among other proposals … accounting for changes in life expectancy over the next 75 years."" That language is significantly more vague than what’s used in the Simpson-Bowles report. This may well have been a dodge to shield lawmakers from having to do exactly what the ad accuses Reed of doing, but it does cast some doubt on the ad’s claim that Reed explicitly ""voted to raise the Social Security retirement age."" Believing that Reed cast such a vote requires connecting some dots in a way that may, or may not, be reasonable. The second qualifier is Robertson’s use of the phrase ""on us"" to refer to those who would be hit by the retirement-age increase (setting aside whether Reed even voted to do that). Given that the Simpson-Bowles report suggests that the first one-year increase could take place in 2050, no one older than 31 years today would be affected at all. In New York’s 23rd district, roughly 39 percent of the residents are 31 and under, and only about 17 percent of the district’s voting-age population -- the target of the ads -- is 31 or under. So emphasizing the potential impact by using the words ""on us"" is a bit of an exaggeration. A large majority of those watching the ad would be completely unaffected by a proposed retirement-age increase that never made it into law (and that Reed may or may not have voted for). Our ruling In an ad, Robertson said Reed ""voted to raise the Social Security retirement age on us."" That’s a stretch. While the Cooper-LaTourette budget proposal was based on the Simpson-Bowles report, which did support an increase in the retirement age, the actual measure considered by the House (and voted for by Reed) was significantly more vague on that point. Meanwhile, even if you agree that Reed was effectively voting for a retirement-age increase, it’s an exaggeration for the ad to say that such a hike was ""on us,"" since a large majority of the district would not have been affected by a policy that was only designed to take effect in 2050. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/19/martha-robertson/new-york-state-democrats-tv-ad-challenges-gop-cong/

Bloggers: Edward Snowden leaked NSA documents show U.S., Israel created Islamic State
","Edward Snowden’s 2013 leak of classified NSA documents is perfect fodder for conspiracy theorists -- it has intrigue, still-unreleased documents, and the NSA as ""Big Brother."" So it’s no surprise to see Snowden’s name attached to the increasingly popular idea that America and Israel created ISIS. On July 16, Bahrain’s Gulf Daily News reported that ""Edward Snowden has revealed that the British and American intelligence and the Mossad (Israel’s intelligence agency) worked together to create the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS)."" This operation, they said, was codenamed ""Hornet’s Nest."" And as recently as Aug. 18, the Palestinian Authority insisted that the Islamic State is a Zionist plot by the United States and Israel. The United States, though, has been bombing the Islamic State in Iraq for more than a week; not quite ally behavior. It would have been easy to dismiss this theory off-hand as another hoax emerging from the general lack of information about the Islamic State -- like the allegations that President Barack Obama released Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al Baghdadi in 2009, which we rated False. But we wanted to trace this conspiracy theory to its source to see whether or not it has legs. The taxonomy of a hoax In their refutation of the Hornet’s Nest story, Time points out that as early as June, Iranian sources have been accusing America of creating the Islamic State. On June 18, the Iranian Fars News Agency quoted Iran’s top commander, Hassan Firouzabadi, blaming the Islamic State on the West. ""The (Islamic State) is a move by Israel and the U.S. to create a safe margin for the Zionists against the resistance forces in the region,"" Firouzabadi said. The U.S. and Israel, he continued, are reacting to ""the recent victories of President Bashar Al-Assad in Syria"" and ""in Iraq."" Time -- along with major American news sources, Al Jazeera, Daily News Egypt, the UN, and several other Middle Eastern countries -- say that the Islamic State is an offshoot of al-Qaida. In fact, we wrote last week about how al-Qaida rejected the Islamic State in part because of ideological differences and disputes over authority. That’s not to say America is completely blameless when it comes to the Islamic State -- the U.S. wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the weapons deals it struck to try to bring down Assad may have all played a part in ISIS’s rise. But there’s no evidence of an American, British and Israeli plot to create ISIS. Yes, this is a conspiracy theory The only lucid defense of the idea that Western intelligence agencies created the Islamic State intentionally comes from the Center for Research on Globalization (CRG), a Canadian website that bills itself as an alternative news source, but has advanced specious conspiracy theories on topics like 9/11, vaccines and global warming. Kurt Nimmo, writing for the CRG through InfoWars, had four points defending the plausibility of the idea that America and Israel helped create the Islamic State. First, he claims that Baghdadi was radicalized at a U.S. military detention facility from 2005 to 2009. Baghdadi may have been radicalized by his earlier detainment by the United States and his subsequent detainment by the Iraqi government, but the Defense Department says Baghdadi was not a U.S. prisoner during the period that Nimmo mentions. Second, Nimmo quotes a Jordanian official claiming that ""the U.S., Turkey and Jordan were running a training base for the Syrian rebels in the Jordanian town of Safawi."" But that’s a mischaracterization -- the article Nimmo links to clarifies that the fighters ""became members of the ISIS after their training,"" meaning they weren’t trained expressly to be members of the Islamic State. Third, Nimmo quotes an article depicting Baghdadi as the latest in a decades-long CIA program of successful mind control, including Rev. Jim Jones, the founder and leader of Peoples Temple. That article actually acknowledges that there’s no record that Baghdadi was ""held and treated by a secret CIA mind-control unit at Camp Bucca from 2004 until 2009,"" but argues that, obviously, those records would have been destroyed. That counts as a conspiracy theory in our book. Fourth and finally, Nimmo quotes an Islamic State member who claims that all current al-Qaida affiliates ""work for the CIA,"" with no evidence besides his word. So where does Snowden come in? If there were documents revealing Operation Hornet’s Nest, they’d probably be in Snowden’s NSA cache -- but they aren’t. Two weeks ago, blogger Alan Kurtz went in-depth on the genesis of the Snowden-Islamic State hoax, tracing it to a July 6 post in Arabic on the German domain shababek.de. From there, the claim spread across Middle Eastern papers, including the Fars News Authority and the Islamic Republic News Agency (IRNA), and eventually made it across the Atlantic to the CRG and InfoWars. Most of these articles referenced other articles that didn’t name sources, but the IRNA, in response to Time’s critique, pointed toward a story in The Intercept, a startup by journalist Glenn Greenwald. Greenwald’s First Look Media is one of three holders of Snowden’s NSA files, along with The Guardian and Washington Post writer Barton Gellman. But, Kurtz points out, there’s no mention of Operation Hornet’s Nest on The Intercept. Greenwald himself tweeted that he’s ""never heard him (Snowden) say any such thing, nor have I ever heard any credible source quoting him saying anything like that."" WikiLeaks and Snowden’s ACLU lawyer Ben Wizner also tweeted refutations of the hoax -- for us, the final nails in the coffin. Our ruling Middle Eastern publications have been circulating a rumor that Snowden’s NSA leak reveals ""Operation Hornet’s Nest,"" an American, British and Israeli plot to create the Islamic State to destabilize the Middle East. This isn’t the first time Iranian publications have mischaracterized the Islamic State as an American creation, but it is the first time Snowden’s name has been attached. Sources with access to Snowden’s documents have directly refuted the hoax. The Islamic State started as an al-Qaida offshoot, and there’s no reason to believe otherwise.

Democrats' claim mischaracterizes deal

","The battle to succeed retiring U.S. Senator Saxby Chambliss is being fought by two self-proclaimed outsiders who say their private sector experience will help whip Washington into shape. Michelle Nunn – the outsider whose dad was a U.S. Senator for 24 years – wants voters to see her nonprofit work as proof she can work across party lines and be a problem solver. David Perdue – the outsider whose cousin served two terms as Georgia’s governor – believes voters should view his time as a CEO and upper-level manager as the experience needed to tackle the financial issues before Congress. Not surprisingly, each side scoffs at the other’s experience, as evidenced by this recent press release from the Democratic Party of Georgia: ""Perdue made $1.7 million in just a few months steering one company toward bankruptcy, led efforts to ship thousands of jobs overseas at another and made tens of millions of dollars piling yet another firm with billions in debt,"" the emailed release from July 28 read. PolitiFact Georgia already vetted that first statement about bankruptcy, which refers to the collapse of textile firm Pillowtex shortly after Perdue’s brief stint as CEO. We found blaming him for the woes of the long-struggling firm a stretch. We’re saving the question of outsourcing thousands of jobs for a new fact check soon so we can focus on Perdue’s most recent CEO job, as head of Dollar General. Perdue was the first person outside the founding family to serve as CEO of Dollar General when he took over in 2003. The company grew from 5,900 to 8,500 stores under his tenure, according to SEC filings. Michael Smith, spokesman for the state Democrats, pointed to separate filings that show the firm’s debt also grew by $3.8 billion in those four years. The figures speak for themselves, he said, declining further comment. The missing context, though, is why Dollar General’s debt ballooned from $346.5 million in 2002 (and $282 million in 2003, Perdue’s first year as CEO) to $4.282 billion in 2007. The debt came from a leveraged buyout, when Perdue successfully convinced the board of directors for Dollar General to be acquired by private equity firm KKR for $7.3 billion. As with all leveraged buyouts, it was KKR as the buyer, not Dollar General as the seller, that financed the deal - and the debt. Perdue acknowledged making $42 million over two years when KKR bought out his contract as part of the deal. But he defended the buyout, noting 99 percent of shareholders OK’d the deal that paid $22 in cash for each Dollar General share, a 31 percent premium. ""It worked for everybody,"" Perdue said. ""We saved thousands of jobs with that deal, and I feel like we did it responsibly."" Smith pointed to several lawsuits from those remaining shareholders, alleging Perdue and other top executives undervalued the company in the deal. The discount chain paid out $42 million in 2009 to settle those suits. Dan Wewer, the managing director of equity research at Raymond James in Atlanta, described those lawsuits as common in nearly all leveraged buyouts. And in all such transactions, Wewer said, it is the private investors finance the deal. Perdue is off the hook for the debt, then. Wewer, who follows the retail industry, said a more critical look would assess why Dollar General was a target for a buyout in the first place. Dollar General’s operating profit margin was 7.5 percent in 2003, meaning 7.5 percent of revenues were profit before taxes. That dropped to 2.6 percent in 2007 under Perdue’s leadership. Likewise, pre-tax profit dropped from $487 million in 2003 to just $96 million in 2007, Wewer said. After KKR bought out Perdue’s contract and replaced him with its own CEO, Dollar General saw a lifetime high of 10.3 percent operating profit and $1.5 billion in pre-tax earnings in 2012. ""Saying he added the debt at Dollar General is totally inaccurate,"" Wewer said. ""But it is accurate to say he was the CEO during a period when the company’s profitability dramatically dropped and created a situation where a new buyer came in and replaced him with a CEO who was able to turn the company around."" That was not the focus from Democrats, though. They look only at Dollar General’s filings to claim Perdue saddled the company with billions in debt at a time he made millions himself. The claim mischaracterizes how leveraged buyouts work, putting the buyer in debt instead of the seller. Perdue also could not act unilaterally to sell the firm but needed his board and shareholders to agree. Moreover, it was not up to Perdue to stay. KKR paid him $42 million to leave, so it could install its own CEO. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/19/democratic-party-georgia-georgia/democrats-claim-mischaracterizes-deal/

Missouri governor says he's been in Ferguson 'almost every day' since shooting
","Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon made the rounds on the Sunday political talk shows on Aug. 17 to discuss the ongoing turmoil in his state stemming from the death of Michael Brown, an 18-year-old black man shot and killed by a white St. Louis suburban police officer. In addition to discussing the reaction from the community and law enforcement agencies, Nixon was also grilled on his own response to the outcry. On This Week, Martha Raddatz told Nixon, ""People are angry with you, personally. Your press briefings have been town halls, people venting their anger, wondering where you were early on. I know you issued statements after about 72 hours, but you didn't come to the scene for five days. What responsibility do you bear? Nixon replied: ""Well, I mean, I've been here almost every day."" We decided to review Nixon’s timeline for the last 9 days. Michael Brown was shot by police officer Darren Wilson around noon on Aug. 9 in Ferguson, Mo., and was pronounced dead at the scene. Tension in the community built and reached a crescendo the evening of Aug. 10, when a vigil for Brown was overtaken by an angry protest and looting. We asked Nixon’s office to provide his schedule for the following days. Spokesman Scott Holste told us in an email, ""The governor has made public appearances over there on Tuesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday, or five of the seven days since the initial unrest a week ago Sunday night."" While some details from those days were provided, his full schedule for the week was not. We pieced together Nixon’s schedule ourselves based on Holste's email, news reports, press releases from his office and his Twitter account, which often documents his travels. There were no tweets or releases about Ferguson on Aug. 10. There was one release from his office that day — an op-ed about mental health. On the morning of Aug. 11, after a night of chaotic protests and a standoff between the community and Ferguson police, Nixon formally requested for the Justice Department to independently investigate Brown’s death. One hour after tweeting out that release, Nixon’s account posted a picture of the governor addressing Missouri ""conservationists and sportsmen."" On Aug. 12, Nixon appeared at events for El Dorado Springs and Chadwick public school to announce funds to expand early childhood education. Later that day, he announced on Twitter that he was, ""joining faith & civic leaders @ Christ the King United Church tonight in north St. Louis county #Ferguson."" Nixon, along with the Ferguson police chief and mayor, spoke at a packed Christ the King United Church of Christ. He gave brief remarks to the standing-room crowd, about 465 words, according to a transcript posted on his official website. Here’s where things get technical. When questioning Nixon, Raddatz quizzed him on why he ""didn't come to the scene for five days."" The church event wasn’t held at the scene. Nor was it in the same locality. Instead, the church was about 4 miles from where Brown was shot in the bordering city of Florissant. At this point, Nixon had not visited the location where Brown was shot, and vigils and protests were being held all day and night. And he wouldn’t visit the scene or Ferguson until two days later, on Aug. 14.   On Aug. 13, he toured a Joplin, Mo., high school re-opening three years after it was destroyed by a tornado and he later met with children from 4-H and Future Farmers of America. That night, Nixon announced that he was canceling plans to attend the Missouri State Fair on Aug. 14 and would instead go to Ferguson. ""Closely monitoring situation & will be in North STL Co tomorrow. Ask for calm & urge law enforcement to respect rights of residents & press,"" his account tweeted. Every tweet sent from Aug. 14 through his appearances on the Sunday morning shows are related to Michael Brown and the Ferguson shooting. Beginning Aug. 14, Nixon also spent time each day in Ferguson. The morning he arrived he visited a local church and later a makeshift memorial, according to his Twitter feed. The next day Nixon had security briefings and held a press conference in Ferguson with Capt. Ron Johnson of the State Highway Patrol, whom Nixon tasked with keeping the peace there. On Aug. 16, he held a press conference to announce a curfew in front of a contentious crowd of demonstrators. As for why he delayed, Nixon told Bob Schieffer on Face the Nation that ""these problems have to be solved at the local level,"" but he chose to take greater action ""when I saw the military vehicles rolling up, when I saw guns pointed at kids."" Nixon spoke with Schieffer and Raddatz from St. Louis on Aug. 17. Our ruling When Raddatz said Nixon hadn’t visited the scene of Brown’s death for five days, Nixon replied, ""I've been here almost every day."" Brown was shot Aug. 9 and violence broke out Aug. 10. Nixon first visited a nearby city on Aug. 12, but he didn’t visit Ferguson until Aug. 14. While Nixon was active early — calling for a federal investigation the morning after a standoff between protesters and police and attending the nearby community meeting — there is a distinct and noticeable shift in Nixon’s activities starting Aug. 14. Prior to that date, Nixon kept up his schedule and continued to make appearances unrelated to the Ferguson shooting. After that date, he held daily press conferences and meetings near the scene of the crime, visited the location of the shooting, and made no other official public appearances. In all, he was in Ferguson for three days from Aug. 10 through Aug. 16, all toward the end of the week. Given the evidence and the parameters of Raddatz’s question, Nixon’s statement is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2014/aug/18/jay-nixon/missouri-governor-says-hes-been-ferguson-almost-ev/

In segment on Ferguson, John Oliver says SWAT raids are up 1,400 percent
","The St. Louis suburb of Ferguson, Mo., has continued to reel following the police-shooting death of Michael Brown, an unarmed African-American teenager, on Aug. 9, 2014. Among other things, the shooting has prompted heightened public and media scrutiny of police tactics, particularly a trend toward ""militarization"" of policing, which is widely seen as exacerbating mistrust between residents and police officers in Ferguson. On the Aug. 17 edition of his HBO show Last Week Tonight, John Oliver aired a segment about some of the problems spawned by police departments acquiring armor and other military-grade equipment in recent years. During his monologue, Oliver used television clips to punctuate his argument that police departments have turned themselves into virtual military units. At one point, Oliver used a clip from Al Jazeera to offer a statistic that quantified the shift: ""The number of SWAT raids have gone up by 1,400 percent since the 1980s."" That sounds like a lot. We wondered: Is it correct? We checked with both Oliver’s staff, which is on a two-week break and unable to respond, and Al Jazeera correspondent Sebastian Walker, who did not get back to us. But we located what appears to be the source of the statistic -- research by Eastern Kentucky University justice studies professor Peter Kraska. Kraska didn’t get back to us either, but we were able to piece together an understanding of his work through several of his published academic papers. Starting in the 1990s, Kraska conducted academic surveys of a sample of police departments in the United States. He asked for current data, as well as historical figures going back to 1980, his baseline year. Here’s what Kraska wrote in a 2007 paper, which referenced statistics published in his 2001 book, Militarizing the American Criminal Justice System: The Changing Roles of the Armed Forces and the Police: ""There has been more than a 1,400 percent increase in the total number of police paramilitary deployments, or callouts, between 1980 and 2000. Today, an estimated 45,000 SWAT-team deployments are conducted yearly among those departments surveyed; in the early 1980s there was an average of about 3,000. … The trend-line demonstrated that this growth began during the drug war of the late 1980s and early 1990s."" Kraska’s math is correct: An increase of 3,000 to 45,000 is indeed a 1,400 percent jump, as long as you consider the terms ""callout"" and ""raid"" to be equivalent. This increase stemmed from two related trends. First, more police departments deployed SWAT-style teams for the first time. The percentage of larger departments that had such a unit doubled between the mid 1980s and the late 1990s, according to Kraska’s data, while the percentage of small departments rose even faster, quadrupling over a similar period. Second, those units were deployed more frequently -- and for purposes well beyond the traditional SWAT realm of hostage, sniper and terrorist incidents. Kraska found that more than 80 percent of deployments were for drug raids, especially at private residences, where officers were looking to seize drugs, guns and money. Such units ""had changed from being a periphery and strictly reactive component of police departments to a proactive force actively engaged in fighting the drug war,"" Kraska wrote. So Oliver is on solid ground here by relying on academic research. But some of the nuance of that research was lost in the sound bite aired on Oliver’s show. Saying that ""the number of SWAT raids have gone up by 1,400 percent since the 1980s"" makes it sound like a current statistic, or at least pretty close to current. But that’s not the case. The data ended in 2000 -- which is 14 years ago. In reality, we don’t have a good idea of how the data stacks up today, since Kraska’s surveys aren’t ongoing and because no government entity tracks SWAT raids systematically. Our ruling Oliver, in deciding to use the Al Jazeera clip, claims that ""the number of SWAT raids have gone up by 1,400 percent since the 1980s."" In a field short on comprehensive data, these are the best figures available. Still, it’s worth noting that the data ends in 2000, and we don’t know for sure what the level is today. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/18/john-oliver/segment-ferguson-john-oliver-says-swat-raids-are-1/

Bob Donovan says no net gain in police officers under Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett
","Milwaukee Ald. Bob Donovan, a candidate for mayor in 2016, worries that upcoming retirements could further reduce what he sees as an undersized police force under Mayor Tom Barrett. In his ‘state of the city’ speech Feb. 24, 2014, Barrett noted he had added 120 new officers in his 2014 budget. Donovan hit on that number when interviewed in the wake of his mayoral announcement. ""The reality is the number of officers has not increased,"" Donovan said during a July 29, 2014 appearance on the Charlie Sykes show on WTMJ-AM. ""Now the mayor will continue to say we’re hiring 120 cops this year. That doesn’t take into consideration the fact that we’ve had 150 retirements, or that we haven’t filled positions going way back."" When we asked Donovan about the comment, he did not cite hard numbers, but told us he figures unfilled positions and retirements have outstripped the addition of recruits over the 10 years Barrett has been in office. Is Donovan  right? Has police strength -- at least by the numbers -- been flat or gone down on Barrett’s watch? To answer that question, we turned to the city’s Fire and Police Commission, which issues an annual report that details the size of the overall force. To be sure, the actual number of bodies on the force on any given date is constantly changing, since retirement dates vary while recruit classes mean a wave of new bodies joins the force at once. The Fire and Police Commission reports, available online, are as close to an official tally of police strength as we found. They list, by race and gender, the number of persons on the Police Department payroll as of the last pay period of each year. The latest covers 2012, so we obtained figures for 2013 and so far in 2014 directly from the commission. We used 2004 as the pre-Barrett baseline for our comparisons, because Barrett didn’t take office until spring 2004 and therefore did not propose the budget for that year. All figures factor in retirements, terminations and new hires. Police officers At the end of 2004, 1,402 police officers were on the payroll. That number fell to 1,357 by the end of 2013, a 3 percent drop. By that measure -- the one the public sees -- Donovan is correct that officer strength ""has not increased."" Barrett administration officials note it can be misleading to look only at strength of force at any one point in time. A new class of officer recruits came on line in late 2004, boosting the number, they said. A comparison of pay period one in 2004 to the same period in 2014, for example, actually shows a small increase in officer strength. A better measure than point in time comparisons, they said, is average strength across the whole year. That was 1,349 in 2004, they said, and based on the first half of 2014 it’s 1,341 now -- a smaller decline. Still, that approach does not change the accuracy of Donovan’s claim. Total sworn officers City officials often will refer to this larger figure when discussing ""officer strength,"" and Donovan did as well when we contacted him. It includes not only patrol officers but detectives, supervisors, various technicians and specialists as well as the police chief and the top command staff. At the end of 2004, the figures show 2,006 sworn officers were on board. That number fell to 1,828 by late 2013 and to 1,875 by mid-July 2014. Earlier in 2004, according to Barrett’s budget staff, the figure was 1,932. And Barrett’s office released figures using the average strength throughout the year that show a smaller drop in overall sworn strength. Again, those figures change the angle of descent, but not the downward direction of the trend. Within those numbers, the detective ranks fell by more than one fourth. So by this broader measure, Donovan is on target again. Ten-year trend The staff strength figures from the Fire and Police Commission show that the police officer ranks grew early in Barrett’s tenure, but have slipped gradually with one exception since then.   Year 2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 P.O.s* 1,402 1,362 1,390 1,441 1,406 1,392 1,362 1,348 1,384 1,357 1,345** As for the broader sworn ranks, a similar trend is evident. By way of explaining the lack of growth in the police force, Barrett chief of staff Patrick Curley and city budget officials said state shared-revenue aid to Milwaukee has dropped by $25 million since 2004 while the police budget is $65 million higher. They said the department under Chief Edward Flynn has re-deployed officers from administrative tasks to community policing. That was accomplished by hiring more civilians to do those desk jobs, they said. Efficiencies have helped avoid layoffs seen in some big cities, Barrett spokeswoman Jodie Tabak said. The Barrett officials told PolitiFact Wisconsin that our inquiry for this fact check led the mayor to quickly unveil a proposal to add 15 more officers to a training class that will graduate in April 2015.  It already had been under consideration to announce later this year, they said. The mayor will propose his 2015 budget in September. Our rating Donovan said the number of Milwaukee police officers ""has not increased"" under Mayor Tom Barrett. Donovan’s claim is on target because reports from the city’s Fire and Police Commission indicate a decline in the number of officers since 2004. And other measuring sticks offered by Barrett’s office show the same trend. We rate Donovan’s claim True.",/factchecks/2014/aug/18/bob-donovan/bob-donovan-says-no-net-gain-police-officers-under/
"['Energy', 'Voting Record', 'Virginia', 'Mark Warner']","
Warner has remained steady in support for offshore drilling
","Republican challenger Ed Gillespie says there’s a gap between U.S. Sen. Mark Warner’s professed support of offshore drilling for energy resources and his voting record. Here are Gillespie’s words from a July 26 debate with Warner, a Democrat: ""When it comes to offshore drilling, Sen. Warner just said that he supports it, and I know that he has said that, but in fact in 2012, there was a vote for drilling for more oil and gas throughout the Outer Continental Shelf. Five Democrats voted for it, including Jim Webb (of Virginia). Sen. Warner voted against it."" Warner replied that his stance has been steady. ""On offshore oil, I’ve had legislation for that for years,"" he said. ""But I do believe that Virginia should get a share of the royalties. The bill that Ed mentioned didn’t include that."" So we wheeled out the Flip-O-Meter to measure Warner’s consistency on the issue. Gillespie, according to his campaign spokesman, was referring to a March 2012 vote on an amendment to a transportation funding bill. The amendment -- offered by Sen. David Vitter, R-La. -- would have re-opened the Outer Continental Shelf around the U.S. for drilling according to a five-year period originally designed to start in 2010. Virginia was included in that plan, but President Barack Obama put it on hold after the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico in 2010. Gillespie got Warner’s vote right -- he opposed the amendment, which did not pass. Three Democrats, including Webb, supported it. But the vote does not show waffling on Warner’s part. We read Vitter’s two-paragraph amendment; it did not seek revenue-sharing for coastal states. Warner, at the time of the vote, cited the omission as his reason for opposing the amendment. It’s been estimated that Virginia could receive as much as $250 million a year if the federal government gave it the same royalty rights it has granted to Gulf Coast states for oil and natural gas extracted off their coasts. Warner’s campaign sent us a list of the senator’s actions in supporting offshore drilling with the proviso that royalties are shared with affected coastal states: *Warner introduced legislation that would expand offshore drilling in 2013 and co-sponsored bills to that effect in 2012 and 2011. *He joined other senators in signing letters to the Secretary of Interior in signed 2012 and 2014 supporting drilling and urging that Virginia be included in the nation’s offshore plan. We spoke to Glen Besa, director of the Sierra Club’s Virginia chapter, which strongly opposes offshore drilling. ""I’ve been disappointed in Mark Warner’s support for offshore drilling,"" Besa said. ""He’s been painfully consistent as far as we’re concerned, and on the wrong side of the issue."" It should be noted that Gillespie, prior to becoming a Senate candidate, characterized Warner as an offshore drilling advocate. This occurred on Sept. 17, 2012, when Gillespie held a telephone conference with national reporters to outline positions being taken by Mitt Romney, the GOP’s presidential nominee. It was six months after Warner had voted against Vitter’s amendment. ""We’ll allow for drilling off the coast off the coast of Virginia, which both Democratic senators and the Republican governor are asking for,"" Gillespie said, according to a transcript of the event. At the time, Virginia’s Democratic senators were Warner and Webb. The Republican governor was Bob McDonnell. Our ruling Warner’s record is consistent: He supports offshore drilling but insists that states, including Virginia, receive royalties for oil and natural gas extracted off their coasts.
