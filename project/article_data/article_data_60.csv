No evidence that lab monkeys in PA crash were infected with monkeypox or spread it to humans
","A Facebook meme stitches together several news events involving monkeys to come up with one unfounded theory about monkeypox. The May 21 post suggests that a January traffic accident involving lab monkeys was responsible for spreading monkeypox to humans. The meme shows three news headlines: ""Don’t approach lab monkey missing after Pennsylvania crash, people told,"" dated Jan. 22; ""Woman who helped monkeys in Pennsylvania crash experiencing health issues: report,"" dated Jan. 25; and ""CDC monitors 6 people in US for possible rare monkeypox, says public ‘should not be concerned,’"" dated May 19. The caption says, ""Hey, I've seen this one before,"" and includes emojis of monkeys pantomiming ""see no evil, speak no evil, hear no evil."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is no evidence that the January traffic accident involving cynomolgus monkeys, or long-tailed macaques, is linked to the current monkeypox outbreak. Officials never said the monkeys were infected with monkeypox, and the woman who was exposed to the monkeys exhibited minor symptoms that did not include a telltale painful skin rash associated with monkeypox. Further, the crash involving the monkeys occurred Jan. 21, and the incubation period for monkeypox is typically no longer than 21 days, according to the WHO. The current monkeypox outbreak began in mid-May and so far is concentrated in Europe. In January, a truck towing a trailer of 100 monkeys — en route to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-sanctioned quarantine facility in Florida — collided with a dump truck on a highway in Pennsylvania. Back then, debunked social media claims said the CDC staged the event as a cover story for releasing the next bioweapon. At the crash site, a woman named Michele Fallon was exposed to the monkeys, and she exhibited minor symptoms afterward, such as a cough, runny nose and something like pink eye. In an interview published nearly three weeks after the crash, Fallon expressed irritation that the CDC was not giving her the information she sought about the monkeys’ health, but she did not mention any symptoms that matched a monkeypox diagnosis. Three of the monkeys were euthanized in January after the CDC conducted a public health risk assessment, PennLive reported. The agency did not provide details about why they were euthanized. The 97 other monkeys were quarantined and monitored for disease, the New York Times reported. On Feb. 1, more than 10 days after the crash, state and federal health officials said no other reports of illness had been reported, according to the New York Times. An infectious disease specialist told the New York Times that monkeypox and other serious diseases are rare in cynomolgus macaques. A Facebook post suggests that a January traffic accident involving lab monkeys was responsible for spreading monkeypox to humans. There is no evidence that the lab monkeys were infected with monkeypox or that they spread it to humans. The woman who came into contact with the monkeys had minor symptoms and did not have the characteristic skin rash associated with monkeypox. The incubation period for monkeypox is typically no longer than 21 days, and the traffic crash occurred in January, while the current monkeypox outbreak began in mid-May. We rate this claim False.

Polls consistently show high support for gun background checks
","Golden State Warriors Coach Steve Kerr gave an emotional speech hours after the mass shooting at a Texas elementary school, pleading with lawmakers to pass legislation to expand background checks for gun purchases. ""Do you realize that 90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want background checks, universal background checks? 90% of us,"" Kerr said during a news conference before Game 4 of the NBA Western Conference finals. ""We’re being held hostage by 50 senators in Washington who refuse to even put it to a vote, despite what we, the American people, want. They won’t vote on it, because they want to hold on to their own power. It’s pathetic. I’ve had enough."" Kerr made the comments just before authorities confirmed the number dead at Robb Elementary in Uvalde, Texas, had climbed to 19 children and two adults. Kerr has been a longtime advocate for stricter gun control legislation. His father, Malcolm H. Kerr, president of the American University of Beirut, was assassinated by gunmen in 1984.  At PolitiFact, we have been fact-checking statements at least since 2013 about majority support for gun background checks, and have found them to be generally accurate, although support is typically lower than 90% among Republicans.  Under U.S. law, federally licensed gun dealers, importers and manufacturers must run background checks for sales to unlicensed buyers. The law bans firearm transfers to anyone convicted of a serious crime or committed to a mental institution. But a private seller without a federal license doesn’t need to meet the same requirement.  Kerr’s statement referenced background check legislation that would have extended background checks to private sellers. The legislation allowed only for limited exceptions, such as if the firearm were a gift from a spouse. In March 2021, the House voted in favor of the Bipartisan Background Checks Act of 2021, H.R. 8. But the bill never received a vote in the 50-50 Senate where Republicans have shown opposition to adding gun control laws. They couldn’t move to a vote which would need 60 senators. The House also passed H.R. 1446, the Enhanced Background Checks Act of 2021. The bill would have expanded the time federal law enforcement would have to conduct background checks on unlicensed people from three days to 10 days before a gun could be transferred to the person’s possession. Senate Republicans blocked the bill. Polling expert Steven Smith at Washington University in St. Louis told us that ""90% — or nearly 90% — support for background checks is a common finding in nationwide surveys."" While polls show majority support among Republicans, it is lower than 90%. As an example, Smith pointed to a 2021 survey by the Pew Research Center that found 92% of Democrats and 70% of Republicans support background checks for private gun sales. Overall support was at 81%. When other pollsters asked Americans if they supported background checks for all sales, they found similar numbers: Quinnipiac in 2021 found 89% overall support, with support among 98% of Democrats and 84% of Republicans. Morning Consult/Politico in 2021 found 84% support overall, including 91% of Democrats and 77% of Republicans. ABC/Washington Post in 2019 found 89% support overall with support at 96% for Democrats and 83% for Republicans. Gallup found 92% overall support in 2018, including 96% of Democrats and 86% of Republicans. The wording for such questions can vary slightly from poll to poll. In an April 2022 poll, The Economist/YouGov asked about requiring ""criminal and mental background checks"" for all gun buyers — a specific phrase we didn’t see regularly in all polls. It found 72% overall either strongly or somewhat favored, while 83% of Democrats and 68% of Republicans held that view. Why the disconnect between what Americans tell pollsters and how Republican lawmakers vote? Part of the answer lies in who shows up to vote in primaries, as well as lobbying by groups that oppose gun restrictions.  ""It is the people who are seen and heard by politicians that matter most,"" Smith said. ""In Republican primaries, anti-gun control voters are almost certainly a salient group that shapes the issue strategies of candidates."" Another factor is the other responses that Americans give to pollsters about guns. Frank Newport, Gallup’s senior scientist, wrote in 2021 that it appears Americans support new gun restrictions even though they are not necessarily convinced doing so will stop mass shootings. A 2018 Pew Research poll showed that Americans were just as likely to say making it harder for people to obtain guns would make no difference in the number of mass shootings as they were to say such action would result in fewer mass shootings. A Gallup poll in 2017 found 58% of Americans believed that new gun laws would have little or no effect on mass shootings. ""In short, I think it is fair to say that Americans recognize that reducing gun deaths is going to require several approaches — increased controls on access to guns and increased focus on the background and mental state of those individuals who take lives using guns,"" Newport wrote. While people support background checks overall, their support seems to drop when they are asked about specific legislation. The National Rifle Association has previously pointed to the results of background check voter referendums in Maine and Nevada in 2016 that showed lower support for background checks than the national polls suggest. In Maine, 52% of voters rejected a background check measure. In Nevada, a background check question just barely passed with about 50.5% of the vote.  The gist of the NRA’s argument is that when people are asked a generic question by a pollster, it leads to a different result than when they actually face a question on a ballot that could affect their own rights. Pew Research Center found in 2013 that 81% of Republicans supported expanded background checks, but when asked if they supported a U.S. Senate bill that included such legislation, Republican support dropped to 57%.  ​​""People may support background checks in general, but become more skeptical when gun rights groups highlight specific complications or unintended consequences that could arise when these laws are implemented,"" Kristin Goss, professor of public policy and political science at Duke University, told us in 2020. Also, it’s possible that some respondents who say they want background checks for all sales may not realize that it is not current federal law — a point backed up by a 2013 poll conducted at the behest of the Democratic National Committee. Of the 50% of people who said they preferred enforcement over new laws, 48% said they thought federal law prohibits gun show sales and private gun sales without background checks. Another 10% disclosed that they didn’t know the rules. ""Most people don’t have a very good grasp of what our gun laws are,"" Goss said. ""To be fair to Americans, gun laws are complicated and vary greatly state by state."" Kerr said ""90% of Americans, regardless of political party, want universal background checks."" Polls during the past few years show overall support for gun background checks in the ballpark of 90%. Kerr suggested the statistic applied regardless of political party, and it clearly does for Democrats, who often support background checks at rates higher than 90%. But among Republicans, we found some polls suggesting their support is closer to the 80% range, slightly less than Kerr suggested. We rate this statement Mostly True.

"['Government Regulation', 'Texas', 'Guns', 'Matthew Dowd']","
No proof for claim in wake of Uvalde that 50% of Texas guns sales lack background checks
","In the first hours after the nation’s 27th school shooting this year, Texan and MSNBC commentator Matthew Dowd told viewers that he owns three shotguns and two rifles, and described hunting as part of the culture in Uvalde, Texas.  Then Dowd, a one-time strategist for Republican President George W. Bush who also briefly ran as a Democrat for Texas lieutenant governor in 2021, alluded to laws ""on the books"" and urged support for more gun control. He claimed: ""50% of the guns sold in Texas, because of the loopholes, do not pass through a background check."" We reached out to Dowd through his website, MSNBC and his book publisher, but did not get a reply.  The research director for Giffords, an anti-gun violence organization, and two university gun researchers told PolitiFact they know of no data to support Dowd’s statistical claim about background checks, which are getting renewed attention in Congress in the wake of the May 24 mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde that left 19 children and two educators dead.  It was the 27th shooting on K-12 school property in 2022 that resulted in firearm-related injuries or deaths, according to Education Week. Background checks are required in Texas for some gun sales.  Federal law generally requires federally licensed firearms dealers, including those in Texas, to conduct background checks when making gun sales. The federal law does not apply to private sellers, and Texas does not have a law that applies to private sellers, either. In Texas, individuals can also buy guns from a licensed seller without going through a background check if they have a state license to carry a handgun. ""So, there is no source of administrative data that provides a comprehensive estimate of the percentage of gun transactions or guns currently possessed in which there was no National Instant Criminal Background Check System check,"" said Philip Cook, a public policy professor and gun researcher at Duke University. Because some gun sales are not recorded, what’s known about the proportion of gun sales not involving a background check is based on surveys.  But experts said those are national surveys of gun owners and not data based on actual Texas gun sales. Giffords research director Kelly Drane pointed us to a 2017 article in the Annals of Internal Medicine journal that reported a 50% finding about background checks. But it does not back up Dowd’s claim, as it does not address the sale of guns in Texas. The article reported the results of a nationally representative survey of 1,613 gun owners done by researchers from Northeastern and Harvard universities in 2015. The gun owners were asked about where and when they acquired their last firearm, if they purchased it and whether they had a background check.  One finding was that, for firearms purchased privately within the previous two years — that is, other than from a store or pawn shop, including sales between individuals in person, online, or at gun shows — 50% were obtained without a background check. But the study found that private transfers were a minority of all gun transactions. The survey found that among all gun transfers, 22% of gun owners said they obtained their most recent firearm without a background check. A more recent study, published by the same researchers in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, utilized a 2019 nationally representative survey of 2,950 firearm owners. That study also does not back up Dowd’s claim. The study estimated the proportion of firearm transfers that occur without background checks, noting differences in the 21 states that have so-called comprehensive background check laws. Those laws vary, but they require background checks for at least some types of private gun sales or transfers, and for at least some types of guns. The study found that 12% of gun owners in states without comprehensive background checks said that when acquiring their most recent firearm, they did not undergo a background check. That compared with 24% in states with comprehensive background check laws. The survey asked about all gun transfers — sales as well as gifts. The Uvalde gunman legally purchased two AR 15-style rifles at a local federal firearms licensee, according to news reports. Such a licensee would have had to conduct a background check to legally make the sales. Dowd said ""50% of the guns sold in Texas, because of the loopholes, do not pass through a background check."" We could find no data to confirm the claim, and available studies and surveys contradict the idea that such a large percentage of gun buyers in Texas were not subject to a background check.  We rate the claim False.

NRSC ad attacks 2 Beasley rulings, omits context
","A new television ad from the National Republican Senatorial Committee accuses North Carolina’s Democratic Senate candidate of being soft on crime. The ad says Cheri Beasley ""failed to protect"" victims of crime. As images roll showing crime scene tape, sad children and a hand that appears to be wet with blood, a narrator says: ""They were victims of violent crimes like murder and molestation and Chief Justice Cheri Beasley failed to protect them.  ""The murderer who shot a boy in the face? Beasley vacated his death sentence.  ""The man convicted of sexually assaulting a seven year old girl? She threw out the indictment. And that's just the beginning.  ""We can't trust Cheri Beasley to protect our families."" The ad includes some elements of truth about Beasley’s actions while she was a justice on the seven-member North Carolina Supreme Court, but omits context about the cases that might give viewers a skewed impression of why Beasley ruled the way she did. Asked about the ad, NRSC spokesman T.W. Arrighi sent an email with internet links to the court case opinions and news stories about them and wrote: ""Every claim is backed up."" He didn’t offer additional comments. Let’s review the claims. The ad says Beasley vacated the death sentence of a man who shot a boy in the face, citing a state Supreme Court ruling from August 2020. There’s some accuracy to this claim, but it’s also a little misleading and leaves out a lot of context. The case was the State of North Carolina v. Marcus Reymond Robinson. Robinson had been taken off of death row and given a life sentence and the state Supreme Court was asked to weigh whether a new law required Robinson to be returned to death row.  Robinson was given a death sentence in 1994 after a jury found him guilty of murdering 17-year-old Erik Tornblom by shooting Tornblom in the face with a sawed-off shotgun after he agreed to give Robinson a ride in his car, according to court documents. But in 2012, the case was reexamined under North Carolina’s Racial Justice Act, a 2009 law that allowed death row inmates and capital murder defendants to challenge their sentences on grounds that they were influenced by racial bias. A Superior Court judge commuted Robinson’s sentence to life in prison after finding that racism significantly influenced jury selection in the 1994 murder trial. Then in 2013, after Republicans had gained control of the state legislature, they repealed the Racial Justice Act and attempted to apply it retroactively, claiming cases already heard under the law were voided and all pending cases were dismissed. This is where Beasley and the state Supreme Court come in. The court ruled 4-3 that Robinson could not be sent back to death row because it would violate the double-jeopardy protections of the state and federal constitutions, and Beasley wrote the majority’s opinion. At the time, the court had six Democrats and one Republican. Dissenting were two Democrats and the lone Republican. The ad says Beasley vacated Robinson’s sentence. To be clear, Beasley’s ruling had no bearing on the man’s freedom. He remains in prison. The ad says Beasley ""threw out the indictment"" of a man convicted of sexually assaulting a 7-year-old girl. This claim, like the other, has an element of truth but omits key facts. The case was the State of North Carolina v. Michael Lee White. White was found guilty in 2015 of committing a sex offense against a 7-year-old. White appealed his conviction on grounds that the indictment used to convict him failed to include identifying information about the victim as required by state law, which says this about indictments for sex offenses: ""If the victim is a person under the age of 13 years, it is sufficient to allege that the defendant unlawfully, willfully, and feloniously did engage in a sex offense with a child under the age of 13 years, naming the child, and concluding as required by law."" White’s indictment listed the child as ""Victim #1."" The state Supreme Court, including Beasley, was asked to review White’s case and the decision by the state Court of Appeals, which had upheld his conviction because the victim’s identity appeared in other court documents. In May 2019, the state Supreme Court ruled 4-2, with Beasley in the majority, that White’s trial court judgment should be vacated because prosecutors didn’t comply with state law. The decision featured one less vote because Justice Mark Davis, who sat on the Court of Appeals before joining the Supreme Court, didn’t participate in the case. Beasley wrote the majority opinion, arguing that prosecutors didn’t meet the standard of the law required for indictments.  ""The State concedes that its intent was to conceal the identity of the child — an intent at odds with the purpose of the naming requirement: to provide notice of the essential elements of the crime charged to the accused,"" she wrote. ""The statutory language is clear and unambiguous: it requires that the child be named as part of the allegations in the indictment … The phrase ‘Victim #1’ does not distinguish this victim from other children or victims."" White served about three years and nine months in prison before being released in June 2019, records show. North Carolina Lawyers Weekly reported on the decision, as did the Carolina Journal, a publication of the conservative John Locke Foundation think tank. The Journal predicted Beasley’s ruling would someday come up on the campaign trail. The ad alleges that Cheri Beasley ""failed to protect"" victims by vacating a man’s death sentence and throwing out another convicted man’s indictment for assaulting a minor. In the death sentence case, Beasley did rule against sending Robinson to death row. But the ad leaves out two key facts: he had already been taken off death row, and her ruling kept in place a life sentence. So it’s misleading to suggest that victims aren’t protected from a man who remains behind bars. In the case with the minor, the ad accurately states that Beasley ruled in favor of throwing out the defendant’s indictment. It leaves out the argument of Beasley and the majority of the court: that prosecutors failed to comply with state law when indicting the man involved. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2022/may/25/national-republican-senatorial-committee/nrsc-ad-attacks-2-beasley-rulings-omits-context/

Fact-checking Sen. Chris Murphy on the ages of mass shooters
","Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., has worked to enact restrictions on guns ever since the Sandy Hook school shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, an area he then-represented in the U.S. House of Representatives. After another elementary school shooting — this one in Uvalde, Texas, on May 24, 2022 — Murphy gave an impassioned speech on the U.S. Senate floor to urge redoubled efforts to curb gun violence. The speech made the rounds of news shows and was widely shared on social media. In an interview with CNN the day of the shooting, Murphy focused on the young age of the shooters in Uvalde and a May 14 mass shooting in Buffalo. ""I want to get rid of these assault weapons,"" Murphy said. ""But maybe we can find common ground on just limiting who can get access to them, maybe say you have to be 21 instead of 18, seeing that most of these killers tend to be 18, 19 years old."" This fact-check will focus on whether ""most of these killers tend to be 18, 19 years old."" When we checked with Murphy’s office, they pointed to a database project undertaken by The Washington Post that tracks every act of gunfire at a primary or secondary school during school hours since the Columbine High School massacre April 20, 1999. The Post found more than 200 incidents that met the project’s criteria. When the Post analyzed these shootings, it found that more than two-thirds were committed by shooters younger than 18. The analysis found that the median age for school shooters was 16. So, using this criteria, Murphy is correct, even slightly understating the case. For overall mass shootings — not just school shootings — academic studies have found that about a quarter of shooters were younger than 25. A large-scale RAND study found that 26% of mass public shooters between 1976 and 2018 were younger than 25. Another study from the University of Alabama found that 27.2% were younger than 25, and that 6.8% were younger than 18. A final point: Murphy referred to ""killers,"" but the Post analysis he relied on included both incidents that resulted in deaths and those that did not. Murphy said after the shooting in Uvalde that ""most of these killers tend to be 18, 19 years old."" That’s largely accurate when looking at school shootings alone, according to a Washington Post database of school shootings since 1999. The database did include shootings that did not result in a death, and the share of teenagers committing mass shootings overall is smaller.  We rate the statement Mostly True.

He died at the scene.  Ramos was a Uvalde resident and was ""reported to have been a student"" at Uvalde High School, Abbott said. Abbott also said that Ramos is a U.S. citizen.  We found no evidence to corroborate claims that Ramos was transgender. That rumor appears to stem from photos of an artist who was misidentified as Ramos in some social media posts.  The artist identifies as a transgender girl and uses the pronouns she/her. We also found no information about Ramos’ politics. The New York Times reported that Ramos’ acquaintances said he was a high school senior who regularly missed class, struggled to get along with classmates and had few friends. Some said that Ramos, who had a speech impediment, was bullied, and that once after he posted a photo of himself wearing black eye liner he was ridiculed using a derogatory term for a gay person, the Washington Post said.   Ramos got into screaming matches with his mother, and often retreated to his grandmother’s house after a big fight, according to the Times. At the time of the shooting, Ramos was living with his grandparents and shot his grandmother before going to the elementary school, Texas DPS Lt. Chris Olivarez said in an interview with Fox News.  Olivarez said authorities haven’t identified any gang affiliations or criminal history. Social media posts claim that the Uvalde, Texas school shooter was a ""transsexual leftist illegal alien named Salvatore Ramos.""  Officials and news reports have said that the shooter was Salvador Ramos, a U.S. citizen and Uvalde resident. We found no evidence to corroborate claims that Ramos was transgender or a leftist.  We rate this post False. ",/factchecks/2022/may/25/facebook-posts/fact-checking-misinformation-about-uvalde-texas-sc/

""This news is fake!"" wrote Markus Walser, a spokesperson for police from the Grisons canton, or district, where the World Economic Forum is held. Police in the Grisons canton did not arrest any journalist in Davos, Walser said. When asked if Posobiec was detained, Walser said it’s clear from the video that he was not. In his video, Trump says, ""Yesterday in Davos, Jack Posobiec, an American journalist, was detained there for a matter of time,"" speculating that it was because Posobiec was ""going against their agenda."" In the footage, Posobiec was on the patio outside a restaurant and initially appeared to be speaking with uniformed police officers and other people wearing plain clothes who are not identified. Then, a person off camera began questioning the officers about why they were ""detaining"" Posobiec, and the remainder of the video was focused on the interaction between the person off camera and the authorities. The officers did not provide a reason why police were talking with Posobiec. In the footage, Posobiec was not physically restrained. One person with the police group said they were doing a normal patrol and that they had a reason for interacting with Posobiec, but would not provide the reason. The person said ""everything is clear now"" and that they were about to leave the area. Walser, the police spokesperson, said that before and during the World Economic Forum, police officers carry out security checks on people and vehicles. Conservative news outlet the Daily Caller reported that Posobiec was ""briefly surrounded"" by Swiss police. ""Posobiec was not handcuffed or arrested, and was not taken into any physical detainment in any of the footage shared online thus far,"" the story said.

As evidence, the narrator credits a ""Professor Chen Horin, CEO of the Beijing Military Hospital."" (Screenshot from Facebook Messenger) We’ve fact-checked several chain messages about the coronavirus, as well as bogus cures, on apps like iMessage, Snapchat and WhatsApp. So we looked into this one, too. There is no evidence that drinking hot lemon juice kills COVID-19. Health officials have debunked the hoax, and a similar version has been shared in India and Italy. There are a couple of things wrong with the video right off the bat. First, the narrator claims to be based in China. But Zanjan University is in Iran. We found no evidence that the university has anyone on its medical faculty named Jiao Shenme Minzi, at least not as of September 2017, when its webpage says it was last updated. In fact, ""Jiao Shenme Minzi"" is one letter off from ""jiao shenme mingzi,"" a popular phonetic pronunciation of a phrase used in Chinese when asking someone for their name. Second, there is no evidence that vitamin C is effective against COVID-19. We rated a similar claim False in February. Third, we could find no trace of a researcher named Chen Horin. The name has been used for similar hoaxes in the past.

"['Elections', 'Illinois', 'Coronavirus', 'JB Pritzker']","
Did Pritzker lack authority to postpone the Illinois primary?
","The coronavirus pandemic has governors grappling with the implications of holding primary elections even as some are insisting everyone stay at home until the public health crisis subsides. Of 23 states that have not yet held primaries, at least eight  are now postponed, according to news reports. Illinois was one of three states that allowed voting to continue as scheduled on March 17, even after Gov. J.B. Pritzker closed schools, barred restaurants from serving dine-in customers and prohibited mass gatherings. Ohio, which was also scheduled to vote that day, shuttered polling places hours before they were set to open by declaring a public health emergency. Following Ohio’s 11th-hour move, Pritzker responded to criticism from Chicago’s city election board over why he did not act to postpone in-person voting in Illinois. At an Election Day news conference, Pritzker said the city’s board had asked him a week before ""to do something that is unquestionably not within my legal authority."" ""They wanted me unilaterally to cancel in-person voting on March 17, convert Illinois to an all-vote-by-mail state, and extend vote by mail to May 12,"" Pritzker continued. ""They could not even begin to explain the legal basis for their request."" It’s impossible to say what would have happened had Pritzker’s administration forced a delay like Ohio’s, so calling it ""unquestionable"" is a bit of an exaggeration. But experts told us the governor’s on firm legal footing to claim he cannot — on his own — interfere with the democratic process. During a state of emergency, which Pritzker declared earlier this month, public officials have broad authority to make drastic changes that may alter people’s daily lives and undercut businesses’ ability to operate. For example, Illinois’ Emergency Management Agency Act allows the governor to control the movement of people within a ""disaster area,"" which in this case covers the entire state. It also permits him to seize property and suspend the sale of items such as alcohol or firearms. But it says nothing about postponing elections. In Ohio, Gov. Mike DeWine acknowledged he also lacked the authority to delay an election, according to the Columbus Dispatch. So he backed an attempt to get a court to change the date. When a judge denied that request, his public health director ordered all polling places closed. That action prompted a legal challenge, but Ohio’s supreme court dismissed it, declining to stop the state from shuttering the polls. Experts told us Pritzker’s administration may have been able to try something similar, potentially forcing the Illinois General Assembly to sort out a new date, as Ohio’s is now doing. But the experts warned that doing so could have set a troubling precedent for future elections. ""You can say that even though the motivations here (in Ohio’s case) were completely pure and even though the decision here was completely reasonable, this is a dynamic that is not particularly healthy to have a situation where a person who is elected himself is deciding not to hold elections,"" said Nadav Shoked, a local government expert at Northwestern University’s law school. Indeed, Pritzker made a similar point during his press conference, warning ""it is exactly in times like these when the constitutional boundaries of our democracy should be respected above all else."" When we asked his office why the governor’s administration had not tried to close polls like Ohio’s did, spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh responded in an email that ""breaking the law and then hoping the Supreme Court agrees with you isn’t how this administration prefers governing."" So who can set a new election date or shift voting entirely to mail-in ballots in Illinois? Abudayyeh told us state lawmakers would have to pass legislation in order to make that happen. The legislature was not in session the week before the election. The state’s election board also said it could not act unilaterally, noting in a March 16 press release that moving the election would require either a court order or legislative action. ""The Election Code is silent on the issue of canceling or postponing an election,"" spokesman Matt Dietrich told us in an email. ""It would require the General Assembly amending the Election Code to give us (or some other official or entity) such authority."" Dietrich said the same goes for mandating election authorities send mail-in ballots to voters. Experts said it stands to reason that state lawmakers must take action in order to alter how elections are conducted. ""Who represents the people of the state? It’s the state legislature,"" said Jaime Dominguez, an urban politics expert at Northwestern University. ""Voters are indirectly involved through their representative in the legislature."" Pritzker said it was ""unquestionably"" not within his ""legal authority"" to postpone Illinois’ primary election by changing the date or shifting the election to vote-by-mail. While there are too many hypotheticals to be certain Pritzker’s administration could not have delayed the election in any way, experts told us the governor spoke correctly in describing the limits of his powers under state law.

Jacobs’ ad exaggerates McMurray’s views on immigration
","Republican Chris Jacobs focuses on immigration in a television ad against his rival, Democrat Nate McMurray, for New York’s 27th Congressional District. Jacobs claims McMurray ""wants to reward illegals with amnesty.""  ""They illegally stream across the border,"" the ad’s narrator says. ""Instead of stopping them, Nate McMurray wants to reward them with amnesty.""  Jacobs and McMurray are competing in a special election scheduled for April 28.   McMurray condemned the ad for its ""lies and hating foreigners.""  The Jacobs campaign provided us a screenshot from McMurray’s archived 2018 campaign website. The website references Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. In 2012, President Barack Obama began the DACA program.    The archived webpage states: ""McMurray supported 'a Clean DACA bill.'""  ""I am 100% in favor of a Clean DACA bill. I further recognize that immigrant communities have always been an asset for New York’s 27th District,"" the site quotes McMurray.  A ""clean DACA bill"" generally refers to legislation that would allow those who arrived in the United States as minors without legal status, so-called ""Dreamers,"" to stay in the country or even provide a path to citizenship, without funding for other security initiatives, such as a wall on the southern border.  Jacobs campaign spokesman Cam Savage sent us a link to an article from the conservative Heritage Foundation that equates DACA with amnesty.  We asked the McMurray campaign about the ad, specifically the claim that he ""wants to reward illegals with amnesty,"" which appears as text on-screen during the ad.  The campaign provided us a statement from McMurray: ""I support efforts to create pathways to citizenship for DREAMers and to increase the number of visas for workers. Immigrants are important contributors to our community and help drive our region's industries, especially agriculture."" Five immigration experts we spoke with for this fact-check disagreed on whether providing a legal way for ""Dreamers"" to stay in this country or create a pathway to citizenship for them constituted ""amnesty.""  Sarah Pierce, a policy analyst with the Migration Policy Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, said amnesty is a grant of legal status with no strings attached. DACA requires having a clean criminal record, paying back taxes and attaining certain educational outcomes, she said.  At the Center for Migration Studies, a nonpartisan think tank that supports immigrants' rights, Director of Programs Daniela Alulema said children who arrived with their parents did not commit an offense. To be eligible for the DACA program, applicants have to go through a vetting process and be contributing members of society. DACA recipients are ""not getting a freebie,"" she said.  Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors reduced immigration, said he favors a legislative fix for DACA. He said amnesty applies to the program, because it would allow students who otherwise wouldn’t have legal status to get legal status.  Matthew J. O’Brien, director of research at the Federation of Americans for Immigration Reform, which opposes DACA, cited the Black’s Law Dictionary definition of amnesty as ""a sovereign act of forgiveness for past acts, granted by a government to all persons (or certain classes of persons) who have been guilty of crime or delict, generally political offenses - treason, sedition, rebellion, draft evasion - and often conditions upon their return to obedience and duty within a prescribed time."" ""A ‘clean DACA bill,’ the purpose of which would be to forgive illegal aliens for their unlawful entry into the United States would be a clear example of an amnesty,"" O’Brien said.   In a 2017 op-ed for the Los Angeles Times, Alex Nowrasteh, of the libertarian Cato Institute, wrote that the DACA program offers amnesty and also noted that ""Dreamers"" constitute just 7 percent of the population of approximately 11 million immigrants who are in the country illegally.  In 2017, PolitiFact ruled that conservative commentator Ann Coulter’s claim that Trump had granted amnesty to ""nearly 100,000 Dreamers"" to be Mostly True. Her number was correct, but the fact-check noted that there is not agreement among experts on whether the Trump administration’s action constituted amnesty. It should be noted that what Trump did early in his term in continuing to accept DACA applications is not necessarily the same action that Congress would authorize in a ""clean DACA bill.""     A Jacobs television ad said McMurray ""wants to reward illegals with amnesty.""  McMurray favors creating a pathway to citizenship for young immigrants who arrived as children with their parents or guardians. This population makes up  7 percent of the approximately 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country.   The Jacobs campaign cites an archived 2018 McMurray campaign website that referenced his support for a ""Clean DACA bill."" The Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, or DACA, would create this pathway for ""Dreamers."" Experts disagree on whether a clean DACA bill constitutes amnesty, and the commercial gives the impression that McMurray favors amnesty for all people who cross the border illegally. The commercial does not even mention DACA. When the narrator talks about McMurray supporting amnesty, ""votemcmurray.com, 5/17/18,"" flashes across the screen. It’s a reference to McMurray's campaign website that is no longer live and must be accessed through the Wayback Machine, or internet archive.  McMurray's statement on the archived website that he recognizes that immigrant communities have always been an asset for New York’s 27th District is hardly evidence that he ""wants to reward illegals with amnesty."" Jacobs' claim contains an element of truth - McMurray's support for DACA - but makes a sweeping conclusion about his rival's broader position on amnety without sufficient evidence.  We rate Jacobs’ claim Mostly False.   ",/factchecks/2020/mar/24/chris-jacobs/jacobs-ad-exaggerates-mcmurrays-views-immigration/

Neighbors app spreads false rumors about military helicopters, pesticide and the coronavirus
","Not even neighborhood social networking apps are safe from misinformation about the COVID-19 pandemic. A recent post on Neighbors, an app created by Ring — the company that makes video doorbells — claims that the United States military is using helicopters to ""spray pesticide against the Corona virus in the skies all over the country."" A map on the post indicates that the user shared it in San Diego. ""So you must stay indoors after twelve o’clock at night and remove all clothes which are outside,"" the post reads. ""When you hear the sounds of airplanes at night, it is for you to know that it is related to this matter (COVID-19)."" A reader sent us a screenshot of the post, which was subsequently shared on Snapchat, on March 23. The text of the post has also been shared on Facebook. (Screenshot from Snapchat) We’ve seen several other chain messages that make false claims about the military’s actions against the coronavirus, so we decided to check this one out, too. There is no evidence that the U.S. military is using helicopters to spray coronavirus-killing pesticide on American communities. A similar hoax has been passed around in Pakistan, India, Malaysia, Egypt, the Philippines and the United Arab Emirates. On March 22, President Donald Trump said during a press briefing that the federal government is deploying additional National Guard assistance to New York, California and Washington to help slow the spread of the coronavirus. During the same briefing, Vice President Mike Pence said the government is also working with the military to charter flights for Americans abroad.  Meanwhile, Navy ships have been sent to New York and California to provide additional health care support. The Army Corps of Engineers is building more medical facilities. And, according to the Military Times, more than 8,000 National Guard troops have been mobilized in all 50 states. That’s a significant activation of the military within U.S. borders, but it’s a far cry from using helicopters to spray pesticides on cities across the country. RELATED: 7 ways to avoid misinformation during the coronavirus pandemic Still, there is a historical precedent for using helicopters to distribute pesticides. In September, Rhode Island officials approved aerial spraying to kill mosquitoes, which had caused an outbreak of the eastern equine encephalitis (EEE) virus. Other states have taken similar actions, and the U.S. Air Force Reserve has an aerial spray program. But those efforts are aimed at limiting the populations of insects that carry diseases, not the diseases themselves. And while Chinese officials have used drones to disinfect surfaces potentially tainted by the coronavirus, experts told us there is no evidence that spraying pesticide from a helicopter would kill the virus on the ground in the U.S. ""That idea is pretty far-fetched,"" said Murray Isman, dean emeritus of the Faculty of Land and Food Systems at the University of British Columbia, in an email. ""There are no pesticides that specifically target viruses, and general antimicrobials that might have any effect (bleach, alcohol) would have to be applied in ridiculously high volumes."" According to the Environmental Protection Agency, disinfectants qualify as ""antimicrobial pesticides"" since they are used to kill bacteria and viruses.

The majority party traditionally rig the maps to protect its incumbents and draw new districts it can control for the next decade. In Virginia, both parties have been adept with the gerrymander. In the 1970s, when Democrats lost repeated statewide elections, they still controlled about three-quarters of the General Assembly seats. Although Republicans have failed to win a statewide election since 2009, they held about two-thirds of the House seats for much of the last decade. But the 2017 House elections bucked the trend. Democrats, buoyed by suburban population growth and dislike of President Donald Trump, gained 15 seats in the House - shrinking the GOP majority to 51-49.  The Senate, which teetered between the parties last decade, was not up for election that year and had a 21-19 GOP majority. So on Feb. 23, 2019, neither party was assured of having power after the coming fall elections for all House and Senate seats that would determine which party got to draw the maps after the 2020 census. In the uncertainty, Democrats and Republicans moved towards a less partisan way of redistricting that legislators couldn’t dominate. They passed a resolution to put before voters a proposed constitutional amendment that would establish a redistricting commission of eight legislators and eight citizens. The panel would draw the maps and, with the support of 12 commissioners, put them in effect. If it couldn’t agree, the state Supreme Court would draw the districts. The Senate unanimously approved the resolution. In the House, many members of the Virginia Legislative Black Caucus opposed the resolution, saying it did not guarantee minority participation in redistricting. But the measure passed on an 83-15 vote that included the top two Democrats: Minority Leader Eileen Filler-Corn of Fairfax and Charniele Herring of Alexandria, the party’s caucus leader. To get on the ballot, however, the resolution had to be approved two years in a row, word for word, with a legislative election in between. And a lot changed.  In late 2019 elections, Democrats gained control of the House and Senate for the first time this century. In the House, Filler-Corn became speaker and Herring became majority leader. They pushed Democrats to reverse course and defeat redistricting resolution this winter. They embraced Black Caucus criticisms that it didn’t guarantee minority participation and that the state Supreme Court - if called on to draw the maps - might side with the GOP because most of the justices are Republican appointees. Filler-Corn and Herring voted for two unsuccessful bills that would alter Virginia’s redistricting procedures by law, but not enshrine those changes in the constitution. Although both measures set up redistricting commissions, they also allowed the possibility of the General Assembly having the final say on political maps. Then, the two Democratic leaders voted against the resolution they supported in 2019 to let voters decide whether legislators should continue to draw districts. Despite their eforts, It passed the House 54-46, and cleared the Senate 38-2. If signed, as expected, by Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, Virginians will vote on the proposed constitutional amendment this fall.  Filler-Corn, in a statement after the House vote, said, ""We must be vigilant and adhere to an extraordinarily high standard when proceeding with permanently changing the Constitution. In my opinion, this amendment fails to meet that standard."" Herring, during floor debate, acknowledged she had changed positions on the constitutional amendment. She said the resolution, in 2019, was changed many times and she did not have time to fully read the final version in the closing days of the General Assembly session. Several other House Democrats who switched votes offered similar explanations. In addition to Filler-Corn and Herring, 22 House Democrats who voted for the referendum in 2019 opposed it this year. They are: Hala Alaya, Prince William; Betsy Carr, Richmond; Jennifer Carroll Foy, Prince William; Karrie Delaney, Fairfax; Wendy Gooditis, Virginia Beach; Elizabeth Guzman, Prince William; Patrick Hope, Arlington; Chris Hurst, Montgomery; Jay Jones, Norfolk; Mark Keam, Fairfax; Paul Krizek, Fairfax;  Mark Levine, Alexandria; Alfonso Lopez, Arlington; Kathleen Murphy, Fairfax; David Reid, Loudoun; Danica Roem, Prince William; Ibraheem Samirah, Fairfax; Mark Sickles, Fairfax; Marcus Simon, Fairfax; Richard Sullivan, Fairfax; Kathy Tran, Fairfax; Vivian Watts, Fairfax. It should also be noted that two two Democratic senators who backed the referendum in 2019 opposed it this year: John Edwards, Roanoke, and Scott Surrovell, Fairfax.  Our ruling The record is clear. Filler-Corn and Herring supported a referendum in 2019 that could strip legislators of their redistricting powers, and opposed it in 2020.  So did 22 of their fellow House Democrats. That rates Full Flop.  ",/factchecks/2020/mar/24/virginia-house-democratic-caucus/top-virginia-house-democrats-flip-flopped-redistri/

No, companies aren’t giving out free baby formula during the COVID-19 pandemic
","Heart-warming stories about businesses stepping up to help people struggling during the COVID-19 pandemic have flooded the internet. Unfortunately not all of them are true. This Facebook post, for example, claims that families can receive free baby formula during the pandemic. It reads: ""If any parents have run out of formula or are running low - call the number on the back of your canister and explain to them the virus has affected your abilities to find any formula - they will send you a case free of charge!

Several formula producers have released statements addressing the rumor, including the ones mentioned in the text. Infant formula brand Enfamil tweeted about the rumor and released a statement saying it’s false: ""Please also note that contrary to rumors in some online social networks, we are not distributing free cases of formula. We are instead focused on ensuring equitable availability for every baby based on what we know and in anticipation of what might develop in the coming weeks. Gerber, a worldwide producer of baby food and infant formula, did the same on its website: ""We are aware of rumors claiming that Gerber is giving away free formula in response to the out of stocks. While this is not true, we are committed to our goal of supporting babies and families with dependable, affordable nutrition, and you can find information about discounts by visiting https://gerber.com/coupons.""

Aptamil, a formula brand in the United Kingdom, said on its website that the company is unable to send out free formula products due to strict regulations in the UK.

A 100% COVID-19 cure? No, chloroquine effectiveness only anecdotal
","Along with sheltering in place, social distancing and  immunocompromised, you can add this word to the lexicon of COVID-19: chloroquine. The drug ""could be a game changer"" in the fight against the new coronavirus, President Donald Trump has said, raising hopes as the nation ramped up its lockdown.   This post shared on Facebook went even further. It virtually screams of a miracle antidote, claiming:  ""Huge! Results From Breaking Chloroquine Study Show 100% Cure Rate For Patients Infected With The Coronavirus."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There is a new French study that indicates chloroquine might help. But even its authors acknowledged the study is small and the findings are preliminary. And Dr. Anthony Fauci, the most visible U.S. government expert on coronavirus, said evidence for chloroquine is only anecdotal and much more research is needed. Chloroquine tablets are available in the United States by prescription only, sold under the brand name Aralen, as well as generic. The medicine is prescribed to prevent or treat malaria; it is often taken by Americans before they travel to countries where malaria occurs. Another prescription tablet, hydroxychloroquine, sold under the brand name Plaquenil and as a generic, also can be used to prevent malaria, although it is more of an arthritis medicine. The claim on Facebook repeated a headline from, and linked to, an article on TeaParty.org from the Gateway Pundit.  The Gateway Pundit, a conservative website, published its article on March 19, 2020, the same day as the Facebook post. It turns out, the headline goes further than the article does, although the article has its own problems. The article reported on an interview Fox News talk show host Laura Ingraham did three days earlier with Gregory Rigano about a chloroquine study.  The article said a study Rigano co-authored found that ""COVID-19 patients who took hydroxy-chloroquine were found free of the disease in six days,"" and that the drug also ""could act as a preventative."" There are several things about this that are inaccurate.  The article said Rigano is co-author of the study. But Rigano tweeted it and is not listed as a co-author. The article identified Rigano as a doctor, but he is not. Rigano’s website identifies him as a lawyer in Melville, N.Y., whose ""experience includes advancing various pharmaceutical assets through laboratory, animal, formulation, manufacturing, clinical trials (Phase I - III) as well as commercialization."" Rigano’s website also says he is an adviser to a drug program at the Stanford University School of Medicine. But Stanford denied in a WIRED article that Rigano is an adviser.  Unlike the headline, the article does not state there is a 100% cure for coronavirus. As for the French study itself, it does indicate chloroquine has some promise for treating the coronavirus.  The authors included researchers from universities in France and Vietnam. They reported a few days before the article was published on their study of 20 people in France with COVID-19. They concluded that the use of chloroquine sped up healing, and the effect was reinforced by adding azithromycin, an antibiotic. Six of the patients were treated with both hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin. After six days, all six were ""virologically cured."" But U.S. government experts quickly put the possibilities for chloroquine in perspective. The day after the article was published, Trump and other federal officials held a news conference about the coronavirus. A reporter posed a question about chloroquine to  Fauci, who has served as director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases since 1984. The question referred to a coronavirus news conference the previous day, when Trump had spoken positively about chloroquine. In his answer, Fauci made reference to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Here was the exchange: Reporter: ""Dr. Fauci, it was explained yesterday there has been promise with hydroxy-chloroquine, this potential therapy for people who are infected with coronavirus. Is there any evidence to suggest that, as with malaria, it might be used as a prophylaxis against COVID-19?"" Fauci: ""The answer is no. And the evidence that you’re talking about, John, is anecdotal evidence. So, as the commissioner of FDA and the president mentioned yesterday, we’re trying to strike a balance between making something with a potential of an effect to the American people available, at the same time that we do it, under the auspices of a protocol that would give us information to determine if it’s truly safe and truly effective. But the information that you’re referring to specifically is anecdotal. It was not done in a controlled, clinical trial. So, you really can’t make any definitive statement about it."" The FDA also tempered expectations, saying in a news release is is working closely with other government agencies and academic centers that are studying chloroquine ""to determine whether it can be used to treat patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 to potentially reduce the duration of symptoms, as well as viral shedding, which can help prevent the spread of disease. Studies are underway to determine the efficacy in using chloroquine to treat COVID-19."" Based upon limited data, chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine are currently recommended for treatment of hospitalized COVID-19 patients in several countries, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A Facebook post claimed results from a chloroquine study show a ""100% cure rate for patients infected with the coronavirus."" The French study of the drug on 20 patients with COVID-19 indicates it could help with treatment, but it is no sure cure. U.S. health experts stress the results are preliminary and much more research is needed.  We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2020/mar/23/facebook-posts/100-covid-19-cure-no-chloroquine-effectiveness-onl/

What a Kushner-linked company has to do with coronavirus testing
","A health care startup linked to the family of Jared Kushner recently launched a website to help Americans assess their symptoms for the novel coronavirus and locate nearby testing centers. The timing of Oscar Health’s testing locator coincided with President Donald Trump’s surprise announcement of a partnership with Google to build a similar website for the Bay Area. Perhaps it’s not surprising, then, that a rumor circulating on social media claims that Trump ""tapped"" his son-in-law’s company for a testing-related project. ""So Oscar Health, the company tapped by Trump to profit from COVID tests, is a Kushner company,"" the March 15 Facebook post says. ""Imagine that, profits over national safety."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The company does have a Kushner-family connection, and Jared Kushner has played a role in the White House’s coronavirus response efforts. But the Facebook post goes slightly too far in claiming that Trump ""tapped"" Oscar Health to profit from COVID-19 testing.  Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law and senior adviser, is connected to Oscar Health through his brother Joshua, a co-founder and investor in the health insurance start-up. Mother Jones reported that a 2013 report from the New York State Department of Financial Services showed Jared Kushner was also a big player in Oscar early on. The state report showed that, as of 2013, Oscar’s parent corporation was partly owned by Thrive Capital Partners III LP, which in turn was owned by Thrive Partners III GP LLC. The report listed both Jared and Joshua Kushner as owners of Thrive. ""Jared Kushner and Joshua Kushner are deemed the ultimate controlling persons in Oscar’s holding company system,"" the government report said. Mother Jones also identified a 2018 New York State Department of Financial Services report, which said that as of December 2015, Joshua Kushner was ""the ultimate controlling person."" Public financial disclosure forms for Jared Kushner and his wife, Ivanka Trump, show that the couple owned and received capital gains from shares of Thrive in 2017 and 2018 but divested from Thrive-associated funds in 2017. Their 2019 disclosures show no earnings from Thrive.  Jared Kushner did seek advice from Joshua Kushner’s father-in-law, a physician, when helping to craft the White House’s coronavirus response, according to the New York Times. It’s too soon to tell how much Oscar Health could profit off the coronavirus crisis. As an insurer, the company is not manufacturing or conducting tests, as far as we could tell.  Oscar Health did not respond to multiple requests for comment. But we were able to complete Oscar’s risk assessment free of charge, and the page for locating testing centers said ""the cost of COVID-19 testing for Oscar members at any facility is $0."" On March 18, Trump signed into law a relief package that makes coronavirus tests — and health care provider visits that result in the ordering of coronavirus tests — free for patients. It’s possible that Oscar could still charge customers for health services associated with seeking a coronavirus test when a test isn’t ultimately produced, however. We found no evidence that Trump formally tasked Oscar Health with helping to ramp up testing for the coronavirus, or that the company’s testing website was created at the White House’s request. (The White House declined to comment on the record.) Business Insider reported that the company agreed to share the code it used to power its online portal for free with the HHS Department, which is building a similar website. ""Last week, the Oscar team built a COVID-19 risk assessment and testing center locator for our members,"" a spokeswoman for Oscar told Business Insider. ""The U.S government asked if we could share our code so that they could customize it for the website they are developing."" HHS reached out to Oscar about the code on March 13, according to Business Insider. That’s the same day that Oscar rolled out its online portal in a press release. It’s also the same day that Trump announced a partnership with Google to build a similar website.  It’s important to plan for COVID-19, even if you’re not currently experiencing symptoms. We’ve created a survey and the country’s first testing center locator to help you understand your risk and make a plan for you and your family.

Dr. Deborah Birx, White House coronavirus response coordinator, speaks during a news conference about the coronavirus at the White House on March 13, 2020, in Washington.

Facebook claim on Sen. Joe Manchin miscasts his remarks on stimulus aid
","As the coronavirus pandemic forces indefinite business closures, lawmakers are deciding what they can do to keep the economy afloat. One proposal is to send Americans $1,000 checks.  A March 18 Facebook post, shared more than 6,000 times, takes aim at Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and his views on the proposal. The post, in a public Facebook group called West Virginia Citizens Against Joe Manchin, says the senator does not believe that West Virginians should receive these checks. The post says, ""Senator Joe Manchin hit (an) all time low saying seniors and the disabled did not need the relief package $1000 on Fox News."" Did Manchin say he doesn’t want seniors and disabled people in West Virginia to receive the relief checks?  Not quite. The post leaves out important context. Manchin did say he believes the aid should be targeted to workers and businesses suffering a financial hit, such as lost income, due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Manchin was interviewed on Fox News on March 18. In the interview, he shared his view about the best way to target federal expenditures. He said that instead of sending $1,000 to those already receiving money from the government through worker’s compensation, disability, Social Security, Medicare and welfare — people who will not be seeing their incomes cut — it would be better to invest in existing programs designed to support families who have lost their paychecks due to the economic crisis, especially through unemployment insurance.  Here’s what Manchin told Fox News anchor Bill Hemmer: ""They don't need to send me $1,000, and I hope, Bill, they don't need to send you $1,000. There's a lot of people still working who have paychecks. There's people getting their workers' compensation, there are people getting their disability from Social Security, Social Security checks, Medicare, people on welfare. None of their lives are going to change from what it's been, except the inconvenience of not being able to socialize.  ""The people we've got to get money to, Bill, (are) the people who have no paychecks now because we shut down everything. That's where we need to go. And it has to be through the unemployment comp(ensation) programs we already have in place. That does more for a long-term period than anything we do with a short-term check we send one time."" Manchin’s office pointed us to a press release in which the senator explained that sending $1,000 checks to government employees who are still being paid does not solve the problem that unemployed workers are facing.  In the release, Manchin said, ""We can support American workers by removing the waiting period for those applying for unemployment, raising the dollar amount, and creating a small-business stimulus. But we do not need to be in the business of sending $1,000 checks to individuals like myself who are continuing to get a paycheck and not seeing negative financial impacts."" The Facebook post in the public group West Virginia Citizens Against Joe Manchin said, ""Senator Joe Manchin hit an all time low saying seniors and the disabled did not need the relief package $1000 on Fox News."" That’s misleading. Manchin said that federal government compensation should be targeted at those who have suffered a direct financial hit due to business closures, including the newly unemployed. Manchin said that workers who remain employed would not fit those criteria for receiving checks. Nor would people whose income consists of government checks that remain steady and reliable, such as those who live on Social Security and/or disability checks. This is a nuanced position involving how to structure government aid, rather than a shot at seniors and the disabled, as the post suggests.
