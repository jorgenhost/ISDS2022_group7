One ex-presidential candidate's attack on another: Scott Walker left school under 'ethical cloud'?
","In a post-mortem a week after the presidential election, former Vermont Gov. Howard Dean, the onetime chairman of the Democratic National Committee, offered a biting assessment of why Donald Trump won. ""What this was, was basically a populist revolution,"" Dean said Nov. 15, 2016 on National Public Radio’s ""Morning Edition."" ""Luckily we have a democracy here, so nobody got killed."" Dean’s views are relevant because he ran for president in 2004 and because he is running again to be chairman of the Democratic National Committee, which says needs a strategy to win over the white, working-class voters who were pivotal in Trump’s defeat of Hillary Clinton. But what caught our attention was the interview’s surprising turn toward Wisconsin, when host David Greene asked about Gov. Scott Walker, who briefly ran for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination before dropping out in September 2015. Dean responded with a claim we want to check: Greene: You made some news in early stages of the campaign. You suggested that Wisconsin’s governor, Scott Walker, would not make the best presidential candidate or president because he hadn’t gone to college. That feels like the kind of thing that might really alienate the kinds of working-class voters who the Democratic Party needs to get back. Dean: I think I was referring to the way that he left college, which was under an ethical cloud for having tried to fix the presidential election for the presidency of his college. Greene: So, that was misreported, you’re saying. Dean: No, it wasn’t misreported. I said he wasn’t fit to be president because he didn’t finish college because he cheated, basically. So, Dean claims Walker left college ""under an ethical cloud for having tried to fix"" the election for student body president.   It’s an attack similar to others we’ve evaluated before. Walker’s college days The definitive piece on Walker’s time at Marquette University is a PolitiFact Wisconsin article from 2013 that examined questions about how Walker left the Catholic university in Milwaukee. The election Dean referred to was for student body president in 1988, when Walker was a sophomore. The winner would not only preside over the government, but get a scholarship and expense money. Among other things, Walker pledged safer streets around campus and bringing in cool bands like INXS and REM. The ""cheating"" Dean alluded to occurred after the Marquette Tribune student newspaper endorsed Walker’s opponent, though it said Walker was qualified. Students said they’d seen Walker campaign workers and/or College Republicans emptying editions of the Tribune from racks in high-traffic buildings. And Walker’s camp plastered campus with an election-eve flier criticizing his opponent’s political tactics. In turn, the Tribune published an election-day editorial headlined, ""Walker unfit,"" and he lost in a landslide. But there was no evidence that the election tiff, or anything else, led to Walker being forced out of Marquette, or that he was barred from participating in campus elections. Marquette confirmed that he was a student in good standing throughout his time at Marquette, including when he left school two years later, as a senior, without getting his degree. He has said he left to accept a job offer from the American Red Cross to do marketing and fundraising. Prior False claims Aside from the article, we’ve also fact checked three statements regarding Walker’s college days. You might see a pattern here. December 2013: We rated False a claim by the Wisconsin Democratic Party that Walker dropped out or was kicked out of college ""not long after"" he was ""kicked out of student elections"" at Marquette. March 2015: We rated False Walker’s own claim that he had ""unsealed"" his Marquette records. He took only the very limited step of authorizing the school to confirm that he was in good standing during his time at Marquette and that he voluntarily withdrew. We haven’t seen any transcripts or other records. August 2015: We rated False a claim in Facebook posts that Walker ""had a 2.3 GPA when he was asked to leave Marquette University for cheating."" We noted that because Walker had not released his transcripts, some still questioned his move to leave college early, but there was no evidence to prove any part of the claim. Dean’s staff, meanwhile, did not respond to our requests for information to back his claim. Our rating Dean said Walker left college ""under an ethical cloud for having tried to fix"" the election for student body president. When Walker was a student at Marquette, there were allegations that his supporters confiscated copies of a student newspaper that endorsed Walker's opponent for student government president. But the available evidence shows no action was taken against Walker regarding the newspaper incident. And Walker was officially in good standing throughout his time at Marquette, including when he left school early, without a degree, to take a job. We rate Dean’s statement False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2af1ef0a-e990-409c-b995-61c993c2e5e2",/factchecks/2016/nov/18/howard-dean/one-ex-presidential-candidates-attack-another-scot/

Rand Paul says John Bolton still thinks Iraq War was right decision
","It's speculated that one of Donald Trump’s potential nominees for secretary of state is former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations John Bolton. Bolton received some hostile fire this week from a senator on his own side of the aisle. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., blasted Bolton in a column on the media platform rare.us: ""Rumors are that Donald Trump might pick John Bolton for Secretary of State. Heaven forbid."" Paul is a libertarian who has often expressed skepticism about the United States launching wars overseas. Bolton is a staunch hawk who served as part of the national security brain trust of then-President George W. Bush during the launch of the Iraq War. In his column, Paul said Bolton was ""one of the loudest advocates of overthrowing Saddam Hussein and still stupefyingly insists it was the right call 13 years later. ‘I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct,’ Bolton said just last year."" In recent years, many Americans have turned against the war -- 51 percent in Gallup’s most recent poll, taken in June 2015 said it was a mistake, and Trump himself repeatedly argued that he was against the war. (He actually wasn’t, we and other fact-checkers found.) So has Bolton really remained steadfast about the wisdom of the decision to go after Saddam Hussein? Apparently, the answer is yes. We did not hear back from either Bolton’s office or from Paul’s office. However, Paul’s column included a link to his evidence. Paul pointed to a Talking Points Memo article, which in turn referenced an article in the Washington Examiner. In the Examiner article, published on May 14, 2015, senior congressional correspondent David Drucker quoted Bolton saying, ""I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct. I think decisions made after that decision were wrong, although I think the worst decision made after that was the 2011 decision to withdraw U.S. and coalition forces. The people who say, ‘Oh, things would have been much better if you didn't overthrow Saddam,’ miss the point that today's Middle East does not flow totally and unchangeably from the decision to overthrow Saddam alone."" This supports Paul’s assertion. Before drawing a final conclusion, we looked at two additional questions. First, did Bolton complain after the fact that the article misquoted him? We asked Drucker, who said, ""No, they never complained -- him or his people."" And second, has Bolton said anything else since then that would make his comment in the Examiner interview outdated? The answer here seems to be no, as well. We searched in both Google and Nexis and found no contrary comments by Bolton in the subsequent year and a half. The only relevant quote we found in our searches was published on the same day as the Examiner article. It was a blog post in the Washington Post that quoted Bolton saying, ""My answer would have been: 'If you knew everything you do today, of course you'd make different choices, but I'd still overthrow Saddam Hussein, who was a threat to peace and stability in the region.' "" This only supports the gist of what Paul said. Our ruling Paul said Bolton was a supporter of the Iraq War who said last year, ""I still think the decision to overthrow Saddam was correct."" Bolton did indeed say that to a reporter for the Washington Examiner, and he also made a similar comment published in the Washington Post on the same day. We were not able to find any published comments in which Bolton offered a substantially different opinion. So we rate Paul’s statement True.",/factchecks/2016/nov/17/rand-paul/rand-paul-says-john-bolton-still-thinks-iraq-war-w/

No, someone wasn't paid $3,500 to protest Donald Trump; it's fake news
","Donald Trump has suggested that paid protesters targeted his rallies during the 2016 campaign, and even stronger charges from conspiracy websites such as Infowars have flooded the Internet. If such claims piqued your interest and you plugged ""paid protesters"" into Google at mid-day on Nov. 17, at the top of the list is this one: ""Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally.' ""  The link cites not one but two seemingly mainstream media outlets. It’s credited to ""abcnews.com.co"" and includes the abbreviation ""(AP),"" which is how the Associated Press marks its stories. But the story doesn’t have anything to do with ABC News, and it doesn’t have anything to do with the Associated Press. It is 100 percent fake.  It was created by Paul Horner, who posts fake news on a variety of websites. Some of his posts go viral, presumably boosting his standing with Google’s news algorithm. The fake news posts typically earn Horner -- according to an interview with the Washington Post -- $10,000 a month in ad sales. In the Post interview, Horner took credit for the fake news item about the protester being paid $3,500. ""His followers don’t fact-check anything — they’ll post everything, believe anything,"" Horner said. Referring to then-Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Horner said, ""His campaign manager posted my story about a protester getting paid $3,500 as fact. Like, I made that up. I posted a fake ad on Craigslist."" Here’s a screenshot of Lewandowski’s since-deleted tweet:  Asked by the Post’s Caitlin Dewey why he posted the fake story, Horner responded, ""Just ’cause his supporters were under the belief that people were getting paid to protest at their rallies, and that’s just insane. I’ve gone to Trump protests — trust me, no one needs to get paid to protest Trump. I just wanted to make fun of that insane belief, but it took off. They actually believed it."" The story’s high position on Google search results after the election likely stems from Horner’s decision to re-date the post, which originally ran in March. The current version is dated Nov. 11. Automated algorithms may not be able to tell fact from fiction, but a human with minimal understanding of typical news articles might have noticed, after clicking into it, that the article eventually degenerates into a rant against Snopes.com, the urban-legends site that has regularly debunked articles from websites operated by Horner. Horner even quoted himself by name in the fake story, something he does in many of his posts. PolitiFact has also debunked at least three fake Horner stories in recent years. PolitiFact was unable to reach Horner independently. Our ruling A web posting headlined, ""Donald Trump Protester Speaks Out: 'I Was Paid $3,500 To Protest Trump's Rally,' "" ranks high on Google searches for the phrase ""paid protesters.""

Sid Miller says Texas university offers 'safe spaces' for students fearing Donald Trump
","Two days after the November 2016 elections, Texas Agriculture Commissioner Sid Miller took note on his Facebook page of a web post suggesting a Texas A&M University campus was offering counseling and ""safe spaces for students who are afraid of President-elect Trump."" Did the cowboy-hatted Republican, who was Donald Trump’s most-cited Texan in the days before the vote, highlight accurate information? Trump unexpectedly defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton on Nov. 8, 2016, after more than 18 months of a bitter campaign--and nationally after the election, at least 43 colleges and universities offered support services, according to news reports, with some reporting spurts in students seeking counseling. Miller, who gleefully received news on Nov. 9, 2016, that he was among individuals under Trump’s consideration for U.S. secretary of agriculture, carries a reputation for provocative social media posts, including a Facebook post suggesting a nuclear strike on ""the Muslim world"" and a Twitter post he later deleted and attributed to an outside employee calling Clinton a vulgar name. For our part, we noticed that on Nov. 10, 2016, Miller shared an article from the website IAmATexan.com, headlined ""Texas university offers counseling, safe spaces for students who are afraid of president-elect Trump;"" five days later, Miller’s pass-along had been shared by others more than 4,400 times. Web post refers to 'pinko-commie-coddling letter' ""I never thought I’d see this in Texas,"" said the post from I Am A Texan, a right-leaning news blog that posts daily articles on Texas culture and national issues. The website’s article said that an email with an attached ""pinko-commie-coddling letter"" had been sent to the entire student body at Texas A&M University - Commerce. The university, which enrolled about 12,300 students in fall 2015, is in Hunt County, which Trump carried with 76 percent of the vote to Clinton’s 20 percent. And according to I Am A Texan, the letter offered counseling services to students with election-related stress, ""outlining all the ways that the university was prepared to help its fragile students who can’t bear the thought of living now that Donald Trump has won the election."" Administrator: No intent to focus on fears of Trump And did the university spell out ways for students to deal with fears of Trump? To get a fix on that, we reached out to Tomás Aguirre, the university's assistant vice president and dean of students; Aguirre’s digital signature was stamped on the email that included the attached letter. By phone, Aguirre confirmed the authenticity of the posted email, which was blank save this subject line: ""An Open Letter to Students: How to De-Stress from Election."" Aguirre also insisted there was no administration intent to focus on students fearful of the president-elect, who was not mentioned in the letter. Miller spokesman bemoans student 'wusses' We also emailed Miller’s office, and got a phone call in response from spokesman Todd Smith, who said, ""Who else would they be offering emotional counseling to if not people opposed to Donald Trump being president?"" Smith’s point: Trump fans would have been happy--not in need of counseling--after election day.   ""Commissioner Miller believes that the mere fact that college students need counseling after a presidential election is a sad commentary on the state of our nation and many of its young people,"" Smith said. ""Commissioner Miller thinks they’re a bunch of wusses."" University's letter So exactly what offer did the university make? By email, Aguirre sent us a copy of the original ""open letter,"" pictured below, which he said was emailed to students on Nov. 10, 2016.                          The letter doesn’t mention Trump or any candidate by name. It opens by calling the national election cycle ""a particularly stressful one."" Next, it says the Counseling Center staff ""wants to acknowledge a range of reactions you might be experiencing Including excitement, joy, relief, fear, sadness, anger, dread, hopelessness, anxiety, and numbness."" The letter’s second paragraph opens: ""We are here to listen and support you as our nation works through this election transition."" It goes on to offer services especially to students ""struggling with the impact of the election or the tone of the national discussion"" and students who have experienced negative treatment because of ""race or ethnicity, sexual orientation, gender identity, religious affiliation, country of origin or other aspects of your identity."" The letter closes with tips for students at ""this highly emotional time for our nation"" to remain productive. That comes after a sentence stating the center ""provides a safe space for discussions on identity, empowerment, intercultural competency, and the impact of the election."" By phone, Aguirre described the letter as a reminder of services available year-round. Also, he said, it was similar to letters distributed to students through the school year such as at mid-term exams and around Valentine’s Day. Aguirre said he put the letter in motion after the election because the school’s Counseling Center had seen an uptick in student visits during the fall 2016 semester. Aguirre said, though, that he he didn’t know if the spike related to the election; confidentiality constraints bar the university from saying why students seek counseling. A student's comment We wondered if students saw eye to eye with Aguirre regarding the undertones of the open letter. So we messaged the Facebook page for the College Republicans at Texas A&M University - Commerce, and got a response from Michael Faz, the group’s vice president. Faz, a senior majoring in political science, said by phone that Aguirre ""sends those emails out all the time,"" up to a few times a month. Faz said he read the letter himself but doubted that most students did. The College Republicans on campus, Faz said, did not feel the reminder of support services was a message catered to students fearful of Trump. ""We didn’t think anything of it,"" Faz said. Our ruling Miller posted an article saying Texas A&M University - Commerce was offering counseling and ""safe spaces for students who are afraid of President-elect Trump."" After the election, the university sent a letter to students describing its counseling center as a ""safe space."" Yet that letter didn’t specifically mention Trump while offering services for students experiencing varied reactions. We rate Miller’s statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

"['Health Care', 'Government Regulation', 'Polls and Public Opinion', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
With Donald Trump and Paul Ryan threatening to repeal and replace, just how popular is Obamacare?
","From Donald Trump to Paul Ryan to Ron Johnson, ""repeal and replace"" has been the mantra of national Republicans almost since Obamacare became law in 2010. With Barack Obama or Hillary Clinton in the White House, of course, the Affordable Care Act wasn’t going anywhere. But now, with the GOP not only in control of Congress but having won the presidency, Obamacare is in jeopardy -- even if repeal isn’t necessarily easy and the replacement not entirely clear.  During the campaign, Trump pledged to ask Congress to repeal the law the first day he takes office in January 2017. But in recent days, he has indicated a willingness to perhaps amend the law, rather than repeal and replace it. So, where does the rest of the country stand on Obamacare? On Nov. 9, 2016, the day after Trump defeated Clinton and Ryan and Johnson were re-elected, Ryan held a news conference in his hometown of Janesville, Wis. Asked about repealing and replacing, the House speaker reaffirmed that that is his aim, and he made this declaration: ""This health care law is not a popular law."" Is he right? For the most part, yes. When Americans are asked about the Affordable Care Act, more generally disapprove than approve of it. That’s true in the latest polling and in surveys done throughout 2016. But there is more to consider in the numbers. Overall popularity To back Ryan’s claim, his office cited a Politico/Harvard poll of likely voters from late-September 2016. We found two more-recent polls, takne in late-October 2016 of registered voters, that found similar results. Politico/Harvard poll How well is the Affordable Care Act working? Very poorly/Somewhat poorly: 54% Very well/Somewhat well: 43% New York Times/CBS News poll Approve/disapprove of the 2010 health care law? Disapprove: 54% Approve: 39% Pew Research Center poll: Approve/disapprove of the 2010 health care law? Disapprove: 53% Approve: 45% Averaging the 16 national polls taken throughout 2016 that have asked about Obamacare produces similar results, according to Charles Franklin, director of the Marquette University Law School poll: 47 percent said they have an unfavorable opinion or disapprove of it, while 41 percent said favorable or approve. So, it’s fair to say that if the question is about Obamacare overall, more Americans have a negative view than a positive one. At the same time, it’s not clear that Americans want repeal. When Pew asked what Congress should do with the law, 51 percent said expand (40 percent) the law or leave it as is (11 percent), while 45 percent said repeal it. And the picture changes a bit if you go deeper, particularly with polls done by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a research center widely seen as a source of objective data that has surveyed on Obamacare since 2010. Other views In Kaiser’s mid-October 2016 poll, 45 percent of adults said they had a favorable opinion and 45 percent said unfavorable. That tie reflects the partisan divide in the country. ""Everything that you hear from the public about the ACA is seen through a partisan lens,"" said Mollyann Brodie, Kaiser’s head public opinion and survey research, referring to Kaiser’s seven years worth of polling on the law. Indeed, the poll found that 76 percent of Democrats had a favorable opinion of the law and 83 percent of Republicans had an unfavorable view. It’s worth noting, though, that like the Pew poll, there was some sign of popularity when respondents were asked by Kaiser what the next president and Congress should do with the law: 49 percent said expand it or implement it as is, compared to 41 percent who said repeal it or scale it back. (That’s not a new sentiment. In April 2014, PolitiFact National gave a Mostly True to this claim: ""One thing that is much more unpopular than the Affordable Care Act is repealing the Affordable Care Act."") Two more Kaiser questions were not clear one way or the other, in terms of the law’s popularity: A final point before we close: Some parts of the law get high ratings, although the data isn’t as recent on this. Kaiser’s December 2014 poll asked about five features of the law and three were rated as very or somewhat favorable by 75 percent or more of the respondents: The exchanges, where people who don’t get employer-provided coverage can shop for insurance; financial aid to help lower-income people not covered by employers to buy insurance; the option for states to expand Medicaid to cover more people. (Sixty-four percent had a very or somewhat unfavorable view of the requirement to have insurance or pay a fine.) Our rating Ryan said: Obamacare ""is not a popular law."" A majority in two national polls done in late-October 2016 say they have an unfavorable opinion of the Affordable Care Act. Those findings track polls taken throughout 2016 -- unfavorable or disapprove leads favorable or approve. Similarly, the majority in a September 2016 poll say the law is working somewhat or very poorly. But it’s worth noting that in one October 2016 poll, favorable and unfavorable tied. And in two polls, expanding or keeping the law as-is was favored by more people than repealing it or scaling it back. Overall, Ryan’s statement is accurate, but needs more information – our definition of Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/1eeb5445-8689-49d1-97a0-300a30fa3225",/factchecks/2016/nov/17/paul-ryan/donald-trump-and-paul-ryan-threatening-repeal-and-/
"['Education', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Donna Howard']","
Donna Howard says 31 percent of Texas school districts getting less per student than in 2011
","A Democratic legislator maintains lawmakers in 2017 can step up spending on education and other necessities partly by tapping the state’s so-called rainy day fund. As things stand, Donna Howard of Austin wrote in a September 2016 commentary in the Austin American-Statesman: ""Thirty-one percent of school districts are still receiving less funding per pupil than they did prior to the dramatic budget cuts of 2011."" We wondered if that was so. 2011, to refresh, was when the Republican-led Legislature addressed a projected revenue shortfall in part by revising school funding formulas. Those changes and other cuts resulted in school districts getting $5 billion less in state aid through August 2013 compared to what districts likely would have fielded otherwise. Aide: Howard drew on state prediction Asked how Howard reached her 31 percent conclusion, Jacob Cottingham in her office told us she relied on a Legislative Budget Board staff projection. Cottingham forwarded a Sept. 21, 2016, email from Andy MacLaurin, a board manager, containing a splash of the state’s legendarily acronymic funding formulas. M&O refers to school maintenance and operations funding and WADA refers to the ""weighted average daily attendance"" student counts used by the state to calculate how much a district stands to get in state and local aid, taking into account varied student needs. MacLaurin wrote that according to the 2015 projection, 31.3 percent of the state’s 1,000-plus school districts ""were projected to have a lower M&O revenue per WADA"" in fiscal 2016 ""than they did in fiscal year 2011 while in fiscal year 2017,"" MacLaurin said, ""23.8 percent of districts were projected to have a lower M&O revenue per WADA than in fiscal year 2011."" So, there’s Howard’s stated 31 percent. Then again, the projection indicated, fewer districts (nearly 24 percent) were expected to get less aid per student in fiscal 2017 (the current fiscal year) compared with 2011. Also, MacLaurin’s email signaled more analysis to come, stating: ""However, please note that these figures are based on the model the LBB has used since the end of last session; this fall, we'll be updating the model with new student counts and property value estimates which are likely to change these percentages."" Next, we followed up with LBB staff spokesman R.J. DeSilva who emailed us district-by-district aid projections behind the information sent to Howard. DeSilva also noted that the cited projection, developed in May 2015, indicated that on average, school districts were projected to field more aid per student in fiscal 2016 ($6,149) and 2017 ($6,098) than the districts got in fiscal 2011 ($5,734). Actual spending data Enough of projections; we hunted up-to-date spending data. We initially queried the Texas Association of School Boards, which advocates at the Capitol, where Dax Gonzalez referred us to the Texas Association of School Business Officials, which trains school finance and operations professionals. Later, at our request, Tom Canby of TASBO developed and emailed us a spreadsheet, drawing on audited revenues reported to the Texas Education Agency. The spreadsheet, which adjusted for inflation, indicates that compared with fiscal 2011, 395 of the state’s 1,024 districts, or 38 percent, fielded less state and local funding per student in fiscal 2015, the latest year of available data. Canby said he focused on M&O aid, leaving out aid related to debt service or capital projects. Also, when applicable, he said, he did not take into account ""Robin Hood"" payments from property-wealthy districts to others as required by law. We spotted another way to break down the figures. Again adjusted for inflation, the districts fielding less per-student state and local aid in 2015 served 1.1 million students, or 22 percent of nearly 5 million students statewide. Flip side: More than 3.8 million students, 78 percent, attended schools in districts that got more such aid per student. According to the spreadsheet, the Austin, North East, Frisco, Round Rock and Clear Creek districts were the largest districts that drew less state plus local aid per student in 2015 compared with 2011. Highest-enrollment districts fielding more of such per-student aid in 2015 were the Houston, Dallas, Cypress-Fairbanks, Northside and Fort Worth districts. Canby, asked why certain districts were getting less aid per student than four years before, replied that how school funding works in Texas is so convoluted, ""there is no simple plain English explanation."" Why do some districts get less than before? We reached a sanded-down explanation after hearing more from Canby and eliciting the detailed emailed analysis of Amanda Brownson, research director for Raise Your Hand Texas, an advocacy group that says it focuses on giving every student access to high-quality public education. Basically, some districts have remained short of making up for plummets in local revenue touched off by state lawmakers a decade past. In that 2006 special session, members voted to drive down local school property tax rates as championed by then-Gov. Rick Perry. Lawmakers also agreed to shore up districts by filling the self-created revenue gaps with state aid but that move was accompanied by a stipulation that a district would no longer draw the shore-up or ""hold harmless"" aid once oft-tweaked state education funding formulas delivered enough money to make up the difference. One more pivot: in 2011, revenue-strapped lawmakers shaved the shore-up or ""hold-harmless"" money--a move that remains in effect--delaying full recovery for some districts. Our ruling Howard said 31 percent of Texas districts are receiving less funding per pupil than they did prior to the 2011 ""budget cuts."" Howard’s assessment was based on a 16-month-old projection while actual results appear to have been worse. Inflation-adjusted data suggest 38 percent of districts fielded less state and local aid per student in fiscal 2015 than before the 2011 reductions.

Gavin Newsom understates California’s big drop in gun homicides
","California voters added to what are considered the nation’s strongest gun control laws on Election Day by approving Proposition 63. The measure imposes background checks on ammunition sales; bans possession of large-capacity ammunition magazines; and forces owners to give up their weapons as soon as they can no longer legally possess them. Lt. Governor Gavin Newsom, who is running for governor in 2018, helped author the initiative and led the campaign for it. The measure had received nearly 63 percent approval as of mid-November, with some votes still uncounted. In a press conference the day after Prop 63 passed, Newsom made several claims about the effectiveness of California’s gun restrictions. ""We have significantly reduced the gun-murder rate because of our progressive gun policy,"" Newsom said, adding that California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate since we started to step up and step in and lead the nation in common sense gun safety laws, background checks, restricting large-capacity clips and the like.""  Gavin Newsom makes his claim about California's gun murder rate at about the 6:30 minute mark in the video above. We decided to focus on Newsom’s claim that California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since it began imposing tough gun laws in the 1990s. Whether those gun laws are the driving force behind such a drop is a matter of mixed opinion. Gun rights groups say tougher criminal penalties, not gun laws, have led to the decline. PolitiFact does not fact-check predictions or opinions.  A Glock 30SF .45 Auto semi-automatic pistol with a Glock 13-round extension magazine installed, and 13 rounds of hollow-point ammunition are seen in Alexandria, Va., Wednesday, Feb. 10, 2016. (AP Photo/Cliff Owen) Our research The gun murder rate measures the number of gun-related homicides per 100,000 residents in a geographical area. A separate measurement, the gun death rate, takes a broader look including homicides, suicides and accidental shooting deaths. Based on our research and contact with Newsom’s campaign spokesman, it appears the lieutenant governor mixed up the two rates and ended up understating the drop in California’s gun murder rate by more than 10 percentage points. The state’s gun death rate -- not the gun murder rate -- dropped 56 percent from 1993 to 2013, according to figures provided by Ari Freilich, an attorney at the San Francisco-based Law Center for Gun Violence Prevention. The attorney cited age-adjusted data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The nonprofit law center advocates for gun control laws and is considered an authority on gun crime statistics. The law center’s figures do not include data from 2014, a year in which gun deaths and gun homicides continued to fall in California. Nor do they include statistics from 2015 and 2016, which are not yet available. Still, the 20-year span is the approximate period during which California imposed strict new gun laws, spurred by mass shootings years earlier on a Stockton schoolyard and inside a San Francisco law office. This meant the rate of deaths by any kind of shooting declined from 17.48 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 7.68 per 100,000 residents. Larger drop in gun murder rate During this same period, California’s gun murder rate declined even faster: By 65 percent, according to a review of the CDC’s fatal injury reports by PolitiFact California. If 2014 is included, the rate dropped by 67 percent. Data from these reports have been cited by both gun control and gun rights groups to describe California’s decline in gun violence. They show gun murders fell from 9.60 per 100,000 residents in 1993 to 3.14 per 100,000 in 2014. In raw numbers, this means nearly 2,000 fewer people in California died in gun homicides in 2014 (when 1,233 were killed) compared with 1993 (when 3,183 were killed). Nationwide, the gun murder rate fell 45 percent during much of the same period. Between 1993 and 2000, it dropped from 7.0 homicides to 3.8 homicides per 100,000 people, according to a Pew Research analysis in 2015 of available federal data. Since then, Pew reported, the rate has remained relatively flat. Our ruling California Lt. Gov. Gavin Newsom said California has seen a ""56 percent decline in the gun murder rate"" since it enacted strong gun control laws in the 1990s. Newsom appears to have mixed up the gun murder rate with the gun death rate. California’s gun murder rate dropped 67 percent between 1993 and 2014, according to a review of fatal injury report data from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A similar, though somewhat smaller, drop in the gun murder rate took place nationwide during this period. Newsom’s overall point is correct: Gun deaths, including gun homicides, have dropped significantly in California since the state imposed the new laws.   We are not fact-checking the cause of this drop. Gun rights and gun control groups have different opinions on this. What is clear is that gun homicides have declined significantly, and even faster than what Newsom stated.

Giuliani: President Trump will be exempt from conflict-of-interest laws
","How President-elect Donald Trump will handle his extensive businesses and financial holdings — and the potential conflict of interest that comes with them — when he gets into the Oval Office remains an open question. Trump has said his children will manage his business dealings. Many presidents in the past have put their assets in a blind trust, which is when an independent trustee manages another person’s assets without the person’s input. But Trump doesn’t actually have to do any of this because the financial conflict-of-interest laws don’t apply to him as president, said former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who is reportedly on the short list for a seat on Trump’s cabinet. ""Well, first of all, you realize that those laws don't apply to the president, right?"" Giuliani told CNN’s Jake Tapper Nov. 13. ""So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust. For some reason, when the law was written, the president was exempt."" Giuliani has the law pretty much right. Trump, as president, has no legal obligation to detach himself from his businesses and financial interests. The law at issue is Title 18 Section 208 of the U.S. code. It says federal executive branch employees can’t participate in government matters in which they or their immediate family has a financial interest. Because of this law, some federal employees put their investments in a blind trust. This allows them to sidestep the regulation and participate in a matter that might otherwise pose a conflict of interest. But the president and the vice president, despite being executive branch employees, are exempt. According to the law’s definitions, Title 18 Section 208 does not apply to them, nor does it apply to members of Congress or federal judges. ""It appears that presidents have mostly escaped the normal web of ethics and conflict-of-interest laws,"" said Scott Amey, general counsel at the Project on Government Oversight, a nonpartisan government accountability watchdog. Amey added that presidents are allowed to accept gifts in many cases, too. It’s been this way since at least 1974, when the Justice Department issued a letter saying Title 18 Section 208 did not apply to the president. Congress expressly codified the exemptions in 1989. In the 1974 letter, the Justice Department said the legislative history of this conflict-of-interest provision indicated that it was never intended to apply to the president. Additionally, the Justice Department said placing conflict-of-interest laws on the president could constrain him in a potentially unconstitutional manner, though it did not give specific examples. ""As the head of the executive branch, the president may not be able to — and arguably under the Constitution it might not be possible to require the president to — recuse from government decisions,"" said Richard Briffault, a professor of legislation at Columbia Law School. While Title 18 Section 208 is the primary conflict-of-interest provision, there are other relevant rules, including a couple that don’t exempt the president. Trump and Vice President Mike Pence will have to disclose their finances, which is required of all high-level federal employees, Briffault said. But the disclosures are not as detailed as federal tax returns, which Trump has not released. Then there’s the Constitution’s Emoluments Clause, which bans U.S. government employees from accepting presents or compensation from foreign governments, noted Kathleen Clark, an expert on legal ethics and a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis. The Trump Organization has numerous foreign ties, including several overseas real estate deals with possible foreign government connections. In 2012, for example, Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan attended a ribbon cutting ceremony for Trump Towers Mall in Istanbul. ""If any of Trump’s business arrangements involve the receipt of payments from foreign governments, I believe that he, or his entities from which he receives money, would have to forgo those payments, or he would have to detach from those entities,"" Clark said. But it's not fully clear that presidents are bound by the Emoluments Clause, and no court has weighed into answer this question. The way the clause is constructred —  that it doesn't specify the president, unlike other provisions in the Constitution, for example — and the fact that President George Washington himself took gifts from the French government without asking Congress for permission, together make a good case that it doesn't apply to presidents, said Seth Barrett Tillman, a professor at Maynooth University in Ireland who has studied the clause. Our ruling Giuliani said financial conflict-of-interest ""laws don't apply to the president, right? So, the president doesn't have to have a blind trust."" The president is, in fact, exempt from the primary conflict-of-interest provision in the U.S. code. So presidents do not have any legal obligation to put their financial holdings in a blind trust or to detach themselves from their financial interests in any way. As president, Trump will have to comply with financial disclosure requirements, however, and it's possible he is constrained by a clause in the Constitution regarding income from foreign governments. We rate Giuliani’s claim True. Update Jan. 12, 2017: We have updated this story to add more information about the Emoluments Clause. Our rating remains unchanged.  ",/factchecks/2016/nov/16/rudy-giuliani/giuliani-president-trump-will-be-exempt-conflict-i/

Newt Gingrich has said he favors using the popular vote to pick a president
","Newt Gingrich, a loyal Donald Trump surrogate and former Georgia congressman who became speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, is poised to play a key role in the 45th president’s new administration. But if Gingrich, who is a key player on the Trump transition team, had gotten what he wanted not so long ago, things would be different. According to news reports, Gingrich just a few years ago backed electing U.S. presidents through the so-called popular vote and not the Electoral College, which propelled Trump to victory last week over Democrat Hillary Clinton. Clinton is still leading the popular vote count. But under our current system that is irrelevant. It is the candidate who gets 270 Electoral College votes who wins. That is the way it has been throughout U.S. history.   PolitiFact was curious. Had Gingrich backed vanquishing the Electoral College in favor of the popular vote -- a change that might have shoved him into political obscurity instead of where he stands now at center stage. The easy answer: Yes, he did. U.S. citizens only indirectly vote for the president and vice president. The U.S. Electoral College was established by Article II of the United States Constitution. Under that system, voters in each state choose a slate of ""electors"" pledged to vote for a party's candidate. In the 2016 election, Trump is expected to get 306 electoral votes to Clinton’s 232. In a Nov. 10 article, Mother Jones pointed to a 2014 letter to the group National Popular Vote by Gingrich. The nonpartisan group promotes legislation that would guarantee the presidency to the candidate who receives the most popular votes nationally. In the letter, Gingrich writes, ""America would be better served with a presidential election process that treated citizens across the country equally."" We reached out to Gingrich spokesman Joe Desantis. He pointed us to a statement made by Gingrich on Sunday’s ""Face The Nation."" When asked whether he was still a fan of getting rid of the Electoral College, Gingrich said, ""I think, in the long run, you want to find a way to have the whole country represented."" But for now, the only competitions that matter are the ones in the swing states. The GOP, Gingrich said, all but writes off traditional Democratic states such as California, which have huge popular vote totals. ""Remember, in 49 states, he (Trump)  had a 2.2 million-vote majority, and then there’s California,"" Gingrich said during his Sunday interview. ""We don’t compete in California.   He said GOP strategists don’t invest in California because they assume the party will not carry the state. ""So it gets worse every year,"" he said.  ""If this had been a general election, where the total vote mattered, we would have competed in California"". Kerwin Swint, a political scientist at Kennesaw State University in metro Atlanta, said Gingrich and a number of others, both Republican and Democrat, have voiced support for the National Popular Vote Compact. Under that compact, member states would pledge to cast its electoral votes for the winner of the nationwide popular vote. ""The compact kicks in when enough states join the agreement that would equal 270 electoral votes,"" Swint said in an email  ""So far, enough states have joined that would equal 165 electoral votes, and they are all Democratic states."" Swint said abolishing the Electoral College would require a two-thirds vote in both houses of Congress. Then comes the really tough part -- 38 out of 50 states would have to ratify it. ""Not bloody likely, at least not in our lifetimes,"" he said. ""Even Donald Trump criticized the Electoral College in 2012, but I bet he wouldn't now!"" University of Virginia political scientist Larry Sabato said he doubts there is any new momentum to abolish the Electoral College by the party soon to be in charge of the White House and both chambers of Congress. ""Not only have two GOP presidents been elected in the past 16 years by the College, despite losing the popular vote, but all five cases in history of the popular vote winner being denied the Presidency disadvantaged Democrats (1824, 1876, 1888, 2000, 2016),"" Sabato wrote in an email. ""Somehow I don't think reforming or abolishing the Electoral College will be a high priority going forward, even though Gallup has repeatedly shown that large majorities of Americans want the popular vote to pick the President."" Our ruling Several media outlets have recently reported that Newt Gingrich previously advocated for electing U.S. presidents by popular vote instead of the Electoral College. Our research shows Gingrich was definitely an advocate of the popular vote option.

"['Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Is Paul Ryan right that the federal tax code has not been updated in 30 years?
","Paul Ryan clearly knows his constituents. To bring to life his ideas for tax reform, the Wisconsin congressman employed a video in which he compared the current U.S. tax code to a block of cheese. ""Right now, our tax code looks like a block of swiss cheese,"" he said in the video posted on his website. ""It’s got all these carve-outs and loopholes, and the IRS is the one calling the shots."" Ryan has made clear he wants to drastically simplify the tax code. Consider this tweet posted on his Twitter account in late September: ""FACT: America’s tax code hasn’t been updated in 30 years. We’re past due for a #BetterWay."" With Republicans in full control in Washington, D.C., come January, many of Ryan’s ideas -- including on taxes -- may move to the front burner. If it’s been three decades since the tax code was updated, that certainly supports his case. Is he right? Remodeling or repainting? Ryan was referencing The 1986 Tax Reform Act, the second of two major tax cuts passed while Ronald Reagan was president. Enacted just over 30 years ago in October 1986, this major overhaul of the tax code took lawmakers several years to put together. They sought to simplify the tax code and redistribute the tax burden more fairly. Changes included consolidating income levels into fewer groups and closing loopholes that allowed people to evade taxes. The law lowered the tax rate for the highest earners and corporations and raised the rate for the lowest earners while eliminating from the tax roll earners below the poverty line. It’s true we haven’t seen a drastic overhaul of U.S. tax laws since then. But Ryan’s claim was the tax code hadn’t been ""updated."" Since 1986, the tax code has more than doubled in size. The Tax Foundation, a nonprofit group advocating for a simplified tax code, found that the tax code grew from 30,000 pages to 70,000 pages during that time. (A previous PolitiFact item confirmed Republican U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz’s claim that the tax code is several times longer than the Bible.) A 2013 Tax Foundation analysis found the amount of credits, loopholes and deductions in the tax code increased by 44 percent since 1986. A corresponding report authored by foundation president Scott A. Hodge detailed some of the changes: ""Over the decades, lawmakers have increasingly asked the tax code to direct all manner of social and economic objectives, such as encouraging people to buy hybrid vehicles, turn corn into gasoline, purchase health insurance, buy a home, replace that home’s windows, adopt children, put them in day care, purchase school supplies, go to college, invest in historic buildings, spend more on research and the list goes on."" In an email, Hodge said though the code grew, the 40,000 additional pages ""did not change the basic structure of the 1986 system."" ""It's the difference between remodeling your home and repainting,"" he said. ""1986 remodeled the tax code, while everything since repainted it."" But Ryan’s statement could easily be understood to mean the code hasn’t been touched at all, which is clearly not the case. In fact, revisions to tax code became more frequent after 1986. ""There are updates to the tax code all the time,"" said Fabio Gaertner, an accounting professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Business who specializes in taxation. Gaertner said while it’s true there hasn’t been a major overhaul in 30 years, in his view Ryan’s use of the word ""updated"" goes too far. When we asked for input from the IRS, which enforces the tax code, spokesman Matthew Leas recommended we ask the Department of Treasury, which collects tax revenues through the IRS. But we didn’t hear back from either. Our rating Ryan said the tax code ""hasn’t been updated in 30 years."" The statement hinges on how a listener interprets the word ""updated."" While Ryan’s camp said he meant ""reformed,"" the statement could just as easily be understood to mean tax law hasn’t been touched at all, when there have been around 40,000 pages worth of updates, many of which are commonly-used credits and deductions. For a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2016/nov/16/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-right-federal-tax-code-has-not-been-upda/

Trump misleads in number of criminal immigrants illegally in country
","In his first interview after winning the 2016 election, President-elect Donald Trump had to answer whether he would keep his word on his campaign promises or change in any way. Trump said he wanted to keep a couple provisions of the Affordable Care Act, which he had pledged to repeal, and he said he would be open to a part wall, part fence perimeter along the U.S.-Mexico border instead of a massive concrete structure. ""What about the pledge to deport millions and millions of undocumented immigrants?,"" asked CBS' Lesley Stahl of 60 Minutes. ""What we are going to do is get the people that are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers, we have a lot of these people, probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million, we are getting them out of our country or we're going to incarcerate,"" Trump responded. ""But we're getting them out of our country, they're here illegally."" Also, after securing the border ""and after everything gets normalized,"" the fate of ""terrific people"" who remain in the country illegally will be decided, Trump said. We wondered about Trump’s reference to 2 million to 3 million immigrants with criminal records in the United States illegally. Trump was referring to a Department of Homeland Security report covering fiscal years 2011-13. That report said U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement estimated there were 1.9 million ""removable criminal aliens"" in the United States at the time -- not 3 million. And the report says the 1.9 million total includes immigrants who are here both legally and illegally. ‘Criminal alien’ doesn’t necessarily mean illegal The term ""criminal aliens"" is generally used by law enforcement to identify ""noncitizens who are residing in the United States legally or illegally and are convicted of a crime."" It is misleading to say the 1.9 million outlined in the DHS report are all here illegally -- though they may be ""removable."" An individual living in the United States legally may be subject to deportation under certain circumstances, including the conviction of crimes such as cocaine possession. The report did not specify how many ""criminal aliens"" are here illegally. An ICE official said the agency was not able to confirm the percentage or number of immigrants in the country illegally with criminal convictions. Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring stricter immigration policies, said her research shows the majority of the criminal immigrants are here illegally and backed up Trump’s statement. Trump cited her research during his campaign. ""Based on my review of various sets of data and records from ICE that includes the exact immigration status of sets of ICE removal cases, I am confident in saying that most of this population of criminal aliens is here illegally,"" Vaughan said of the 1.9 million in the federal report. ""Under the law, criminal aliens who at one time had legal status generally would become disqualified for that legal status upon conviction of certain crimes."" Adam Cox, an expert on immigration law and professor at New York University, said a criminal conviction itself does not alter the immigration status of a lawful immigrant, such as a green card holder. ""These immigrants are not stripped of their status the moment they are convicted,"" Cox said. If a convicted green card holder is placed in deportation proceedings, he or she would lose the green card only at the end of immigration proceedings if an immigration judge rules that the criminal conviction makes the person deportable, Cox said. Trump’s claim that ""it could be even 3 million"" criminal immigrants in the country illegally also surpasses calculations from a group estimating it could be less than 1 million. The Migration Policy Institute, a think tank analyzing the movement of people and policies that affect them, in July 2015 estimated that 43 percent, or 820,000, of the 1.9 million noncitizens convicted of crimes were unauthorized immigrants. The institute analyzed estimates of the unauthorized population and the number of noncitizens lawfully in the country and estimated that both groups commit crimes at similar rates. The precise number of unauthorized immigrants convicted of crimes may be higher or lower, with a margin of error in the low tens of thousands, the institute said. Trump’s plan to deport 2 million to 3 million parallels the number of total immigrants deported under President Barack Obama. More than 2 million people have been deported over the course of Obama’s presidency. Our ruling Trump said there are ""probably 2 million, it could be even 3 million"" criminal immigrants in the country illegally. Trump’s slightly hedged numbers stem from a federal report that said there are about 1.9 million ""removable criminal aliens,"" but that includes people here legally and illegally. Trump’s claim that it could even be 3 million is based on an assumption. He's in the ballpark but misses important details.

No evidence that COVID-19 vaccines causing the summer surge in COVID-19 cases
","In a video from a school board meeting gone viral, an Indiana family doctor claims that this summer’s surge in COVID-19 cases is caused by COVID-19 vaccines. More specifically, Dr. Dan Stock blames ""antibody mediated viral enhancement,"" a phenomenon he claims the vaccines caused. The video, shared in Facebook posts like this one, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Antibody-dependent enhancement, as it is more commonly known, is a real but rare phenomenon in which people who are vaccinated can experience more severe symptoms if they are later infected by a virus. What has borne out this summer is the opposite of what Stock claims — the vast majority of people who are hospitalized because of COVID-19 or die from it have not been vaccinated. ""There is no evidence that (antibody-dependent enhancement) is responsible for this surge,"" said Dr. David Relman, a professor in medicine, microbiology and immunology at Stanford University.  ""All epidemiological data on this surge from across the United States and the world clearly show that this surge is happening in non-vaccinated people,"" he said. ""Furthermore, vaccinated people with breakthrough delta variant infections have less severe disease than non-vaccinated people with delta infections."" Stock spoke at the Aug. 6 meeting of the board of the Mt. Vernon Community School Corporation in Fortville, about 20 miles northeast of Indianapolis. He described himself as a ""functional family medicine physician,"" saying that means he is ""specially trained in immunology and inflammation regulation."" First, he said that recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Indiana Board of Health are ""actually contrary to all the rules of science."" Then Stock made his claim about ""the condition that is called antibody mediated viral enhancement. That is a condition done when vaccines work wrong.""  A vaccine that is ""done the wrong way"" for a respiratory virus, Stock continued, ""causes the immune system to actually fight the virus wrong and lets the virus become worse than it would with native infection. And that is why you are seeing an outbreak right now.""  Stock, who sells supplements on his website, did not respond to a voicemail message. His voicemail greeting said research information he gave to the school board is on a blog for the Hancock County Indiana Patriots, a group that says it advocates for ""liberty and other conservatives issues like life, guns, medical freedom, etc.""  The page lists 21 documents, but none of them address his claim about antibody-dependent enhancement and the COVID-19 surge. Melissa Brown, a professor in microbiology/immunology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said that people who are vaccinated, ""if they get sick, generally have mild disease. If (antibody-dependent enhancement) were playing a major role, we would expect the vaccinated to be sicker."" The reason for the new outbreaks is the delta variant is much more contagious, ""so, it is spreading like wildfire in unvaccinated individuals — not in vaccinated people."" Some statistics to consider: More than 164 million people in the United States had been fully vaccinated and, based on reports from 49 U.S. states and territories, there were 7,525 breakthrough cases in which the person was hospitalized or died, according to the latest figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That comes out to less than one-hundredth of 1%. According to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, among 25 states that report data on breakthrough cases, hospitalization rates among fully vaccinated people ranged from effectively 0% to 0.06%; and death rates ranged from effectively 0% to 0.01%. Seven states, including some with the lowest rates of people who are fully vaccinated, accounted for about half of new cases and hospitalizations in the previous week, the White House said at a briefing Aug. 5. They include Florida (49.7% fully vaccinated), Texas (44.6%), Missouri (42.3%), Arkansas (37.7%), Louisiana (37.7%), Alabama (35%) and Mississippi (35.2%). As of Aug. 10, according to Mayo Clinic, 50.5% of the U.S. population is fully vaccinated. Dr. Matthew Laurens, a pediatrics professor at the University of Maryland School of Medicine and a faculty member of its Center for Vaccine Development and Global Health, said people who are vaccinated ""are much less likely to experience enhanced disease that would cause them to be hospitalized, admitted to intensive care, or die. ""We also have evidence that the delta variant is more likely to spread in communities with low vaccination rates, which provides additional proof that vaccines are not enhancing virus spread but are actually slowing it down."" A doctor in a viral video says the surge in COVID-19 cases is caused by ""antibody mediated viral enhancement"" from the COVID-19 vaccines. There is no evidence that the rare phenomenon known as antibody-dependent enhancement, is causing a surge. In fact, evidence shows the opposite: that the vast majority of COVID-19 cases are occurring among people who are not vaccinated. The post is false and ridiculous.

DeSantis’ executive order misleads about the lack of scientific support for masking in schools
","On July 30, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis issued an executive order stating that schools couldn’t mandate that their students wear masks, and that it should be up to parents to decide whether they want their children masked in school buildings. The order also said the state can deny funding to districts that don’t comply. One part of the order particularly caught our attention because of what it said about masks: ""WHEREAS, despite recent Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) ‘guidance,’ forcing students to wear masks lacks a well-grounded scientific justification; indeed, a Brown University study analyzed COVID-19 data for schools in Florida and found no correlation with mask mandates."" RELATED: Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis mischaracterizes the efficacy of face masks The executive order came on the heels of the CDC guidelines for reopening K-12 schools, which recommended that everyone age 2 and up should wear masks whether they are vaccinated or not. In addition to universal indoor masking, CDC recommends schools maintain at least 3 feet of physical distance between students within classrooms to reduce transmission risk. When it is not possible to maintain a physical distance of at least 3 feet, such as when schools cannot fully re-open while maintaining these distances, it is especially important to layer multiple other prevention strategies, such as screening testing.This guidance was issued partly because of the increase in COVID-19 cases due to the delta variant, which is more contagious than other versions of the virus. It was also issued because COVID-19 vaccines have not yet been authorized for use in children under age 12. During the pandemic, DeSantis, a Republican, has consistently taken positions contrary to public health guidance from experts and said he wants Florida to remain open. ""In Florida, there will be no lockdowns, there will be no school closures, there will be no restrictions and no mandates,"" DeSantis said during a speech introducing the executive order, which drew immediate pushback. President Joe Biden criticized his position and a group of Florida parents filed a lawsuit to block the order. But the state is currently considered a COVID hot spot. The Florida Department of Health reported there were 134,506 new cases of COVID-19 from July 30 to Aug. 5. That’s compared to 11,837 new cases over the earlier week-long period beginning June 4, before the delta variant surge. Hospitalizations have also increased. Total COVID-related hospitalizations were at almost 14,000 on Aug. 9, compared to a seven-day average of 229 hospitalizations as of June 6. DeSantis’ executive order cites a Brown University study to support his argument that schools can’t mandate masks. We reached out to DeSantis’ office to confirm the role of that study and to ask if any other research was involved in the development of the executive order. Press secretary Christina Pushaw replied with an emailed statement reiterating the governor’s position that studies have shown COVID-19’s spread in schools is typically less than within the larger community and that science has yet to substantiate the effectiveness of masks in reducing what she said was ""an already very low risk of COVID-19 in children."" She acknowledged that the delta variant has been shown to be more transmissible — which means it could increase children’s risk — ""but that is only a working theory as no studies have shown that conclusively."" That made us wonder about key elements of the executive order — specifically, whether the Brown study indeed illustrated that mask mandates didn’t prevent transmission of COVID-19 and if it’s correct that ""forcing students to wear masks lacks a well-grounded scientific justification."" We reached out to Emily Oster, a professor of economics at Brown University, and the lead author of the study that DeSantis’ order references. Oster became well known during the pandemic for issuing data-driven recommendations on parenting and schooling. Some experts, though, have taken issue with her being an economist and not an epidemiologist. Oster told us she couldn’t participate in a direct interview about the study, but she sent us this statement: ""We did not consult with Gov. DeSantis on these issues. Our paper is currently a pre-print, undergoing peer review. It relies on data from the 2020-2021 school year, prior to the emergence of the more contagious delta variant. Current CDC guidance, taking into account the current virus situation and all available data on masking, suggests masking for all K-12 students and staff, regardless of vaccination status."" The study analyzed whether mask mandates in school districts in Florida and other states influenced the number of COVID-19 cases among students and staff members by looking at mitigation strategies as well as COVID-19 case counts. The researchers found that staff rates of COVID-19 were slightly higher in districts without mask mandates, but the difference was not statistically significant. Overall, no correlation was found between mask mandates and COVID cases in students. But within the study itself, the authors wrote about the limitations of their methods. For instance, the study looked only at whether mandates existed at particular schools — not at the mask-wearing behavior of students and staffers. The study also didn’t account for mitigation measures that might have been in place in the surrounding community, which would influence case counts. At the end of the study, the authors offer a conclusion that undermines the executive order: ""We would emphasize that in general this literature suggests in-person school can be operated safely with appropriate mitigation, which typically includes universal masking. It would be premature to draw any alternative conclusions about this question based on this preliminary data."" Justin Lessler, an epidemiology professor at the University of North Carolina, who led a peer-reviewed study that found masking in schools was associated with a significantly reduced risk of COVID-19 transmission, said he didn’t think this Brown study showed any strong conclusions to support the governor’s position. ""I think the lack of correlation with mask mandates at the population level is pretty weak evidence,"" Lessler wrote in an email. ""Also, mechanistically, it is a little hard to believe masking would not have some effect."" Dr. Lynn Goldman, dean of the Milken Institute of Public Health at George Washington University, said masks are absolutely effective in reducing COVID-19 transmission in children. ""What the science actually shows is that for children ages 2 and above, masks are not only protective but needed,"" said Goldman, who is also a pediatrician. Since ""those kids who are below the age of 12 cannot yet have the vaccine so they don’t have that layer of protection."" Goldman also said studies show masking is effective in preventing COVID-19 transmission in schools. The CDC guidance also cites several CDC-led studies that show the benefits of masking in schools, while independent researchers have shown similar results. Masking was often combined with other efforts to reduce spread, including improved ventilation and filtration systems.  These points counter a claim central to DeSantis’ executive order: that the CDC school-reopening guidance ""lacks a well-grounded scientific justification."" ""I think this ‘whereas’ of DeSantis’ executive order is just false, it’s just patently false,"" said Dr. Jeffrey Goldhagen, a pediatrics professor at the University of Florida Health in Jacksonville. Though studies early in the pandemic did seem to indicate children were less likely to get COVID than adults, current CDC data suggests that no longer seems to be the case. CDC data through March 2021 shows that COVID-19 infection and symptomatic illness in children ages 5 to 17 was comparable to infection and illness in adults ages 18 to 49. Studies have also shown that even if children have mild or asymptomatic cases of COVID-19 they can spread the disease to adults who may then develop more severe cases — meaning children can be significant vectors of disease. Children also are susceptible to the delta variant, which is more transmissible than the alpha variant. Goldhagen said he has already anecdotally heard and seen the spread of the delta variant among children in camps and in schools that have started their semesters. Pediatric COVID-19 hospitalizations have also been increasing in Florida in the past week, likely due to the delta variant, and there are reports that some children are experiencing serious symptoms. ""The increase in the number of patients that we have in our children’s hospital due to COVID-19 has increased 500%,"" Goldhagen, who is also a pediatrician at Wolfson Children’s Hospital in Jacksonville, told us on Aug. 5. DeSantis’ July 30 executive order missed the mark with its claim that ""forcing students to wear masks lacks a well-grounded scientific justification."" It also cited a Brown University study as scientific evidence that there is no correlation between mask mandates and reduced COVID-19 spread. However, while that study didn’t show a correlation, its authors noted the study’s limitations and concluded that appropriate mitigation typically includes universal masking. It flatly stated it would be premature to draw other conclusions based on the researchers’ preliminary data. Multiple studies also show masking in schools does have an effect on preventing COVID-19 transmission. DeSantis’ executive order cherry-picked a study that offers little basis for his position and includes a variety of elements that are not accurate. We rate this False. UPDATE, Aug. 11: This story has been updated with newly released numbers on COVID-19 case counts from the Florida Department of Health for the week ending Aug. 5. The fact check originally cited a CDC one-day case tally that has since been lowered to 19,584, which the health department disputes, citing its own tally of 15,319.

CNN clip about Andrew Cuomo doesn’t include Jeffrey Toobin
","New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Aug. 10  announced plans to resign amid ongoing criminal investigations. The state’s attorney general, Letitia James, had recently released a report finding that Cuomo had sexually harassed 11 women.  Cuomo has denied the charges. For weeks the sexual harassment allegations against Cuomo have drawn scrutiny, as have conflict-of-interest questions concerning CNN and anchor Chris Cuomo, who often had his governor brother on his show. On Aug. 3, conservative commentator Clay Travis called out the network for another apparent conflict of interest.  ""CNN currently has Zoom masturbator Jeffrey Toobin on analyzing the Andrew Cuomo sexual harassment allegations as their legal expert,"" he tweeted. ""Amazing.""  Chris Stigall, a conservative radio host, tweeted something similar that day alongside an image of a CNN broadcast with a panel of four guests. The man in the bottom left corner resembles Toobin, who spent eight months on leave from CNN after exposing himself to his New Yorker magazine colleagues during a Zoom call. Toobin returned to CNN as the network’s chief legal analyst in June.  But that wasn’t Toobin discussing the attorney general’s report about Cuomo. It was CNN political director David Chalian. You can watch a clip of the segment here.  Travis and political commentator Megyn Kelly issued corrections. Stigall also tweeted a follow-up saying that it wasn’t Toobin.

Wisconsin’s working-age population drops while population in general grows
","There is a worker shortage in Wisconsin. Look no further than the proliferation of ""help wanted,"" ""we’re hiring"" and ""apply within"" signs across the state.  Joblessness from the pandemic fallout can be blamed for much of the problem; Republicans and allies have pointed toward enhanced federal unemployment benefits, which they say are keeping would-be workers on the sidelines. In a June 27, 2021 appearance on WISN TV’s ""UpFront,"" Kurt Bauer, president and CEO of Wisconsin Manufacturers & Commerce, pointed to another factor: Demographics. ""The demographics are such that we are not having replacement birth rates,"" Bauer said. ""We have had more people leaving the state than coming in over the last 30 years."" It’s a particularly timely claim, with more census numbers rolling out in the coming days and months. Is Bauer right that over the past 30 years more people have left Wisconsin than moved here? When asked to provide back up for the claim, WMC spokesman Nick Novak said Bauer was making the point that ""Wisconsin has work to do on attracting and retaining workers."" ""If we are to keep growing our economy, we will need to reverse both recent and long-term trends of attracting more working-age people to Wisconsin, retaining our workers here and increasing birth rates to no longer be below replacement levels,"" Novak wrote in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. Novak referred to two reports: A 2019 Forward Analytics report ""Falling Behind: Migration Changes & State Workforce"" and to information from the University of Wisconsin- Madison’s Applied Population Lab.  We’ll turn to both of them, and some additional sources, as we dig into the claim. Bauer talked about the past 30 years, so that means the period from 1990 to 2020. Changes in population are a dynamic thing, but are based on four fundamental factors: How many people are born, how many people die, how many people move in and how many people move out. You can also measure different portions of the population, for instance breaking it down by age group. In this case, Bauer is mixing together multiple things, when he references both ""replacement birth rates"" and working-age people moving away. The big picture is this: The state’s population in general is growing, while it’s working age population is falling. According to the UW population lab, from 1990 to 2020, the state gained 362,899 people. That includes gains in each decade:  1990s: 227,637  2000s: 79,938  2010s: 55,324 So, when looking only at the population in general, Bauer’s claim starts off on the wrong foot. It suggests we are losing population in some form. ""The state grew by 9.6% in the 1990s, 6.0% in the 2000s, and 3.6% in the 2010s,"" said John Johnson, research fellow in the Lubar Center for Public Policy Research and Civic Education at the Marquette University Law School.  ""So the issue is a declining rate of growth. We are still growing, just at the slowest pace in the state's history."" That said, Bauer is focused on the working-age population, generally considered those between age 15 and 64. When you look at working-age population, the picture differs. According to  Forward Analytics demographer Dale Knapp, in 1990, some 3,148,742 people fell into the working age category. In 2000, that figure had risen to 3,536,228. In 2010 it had risen to 3,801,879, but by 2020, the number had dropped to 3,745,350. In other words, the working age population saw increases in the two decades from 1990 to 2010, but a decrease from 2010 to 2020. But what happens when we look strictly at migration patterns? That is, people moving in and moving out. Remember, this was the underlying point of the claim -- that our workforce is suffering because not enough people of working age are moving here. Knapp, director of research and analytics at Forward Analytics, which is affiliated with the Wisconsin Counties Association, examined age-group migration over five-year periods. He looked at the population of a cohort in one year, and then looked at the population of that same group when they were five years older. Knapp adjusted for deaths, and that gave him a net migration number.  The approach has limitations. ""That means that I can't look at the 15-64 group in both years,"" Knapp explained. ""That 15-64 year old group in the base year becomes 20-69 five years later."" In any case, here are five-year migration numbers for the 15-59 year old groups as they age to 20-64 over five years:   1990-1995:  +91,850 1995-2000:  -8,345 2000-2005:  +16,392 2005-2010:  -29,237  2010-2015:  -30,953 Knapp said he couldn’t provide the 2015-20 numbers yet because he doesn’t have deaths for those years. However, he said, ""the ‘before deaths’ number for that period is -118,034 (that compares to a ‘before death’ number of -78,571 during 2010-15). That tells me that we likely had a large net outflow of working age people during those years."" So, generally speaking the pattern over the past 30 years has been losses, not gains. That’s in line with Bauer’s claim. Bauer said ""We are not having replacement birth rates. We have had more people leaving the state than coming in over the last 30 years."" There are a lot of ways to analyze the data, but here is the bottom line: Overall state population has continued to grow, albeit by one of the slowest rates in history. The working-age population fell over the past 10 years -- not the past three decades, which is the timeframe Bauer offered. And when the impact of people moving in and out is isolated, the picture is one of ups and downs -- but more downs than ups, including in recent years. For a statement that is partially accurate, our rating is Half True.    ",/factchecks/2021/aug/10/kurt-bauer/wisconsins-working-age-population-drops-while-popu/

""FDA has not approved ivermectin for use in treating or preventing COVID-19 in humans.

Youngkin offers little proof critical race theory is in 'all' Virginia schools
","Republican gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin says critical race theory has become pervasive in Virginia schools and must be expunged.  ""We actually have this critical race theory moved into all of our schools in Virginia,"" he said during a July 9 campaign speech in rural Wytheville. ""We’re actually watching this critical race theory move its way into all schools across Virginia,"" he told conservative radio host Hugh Hewitt on July 23. ""Critical race theory has moved into our school system and we have to remove it,"" he told Fox News on Aug. 5. Critical race theory — a broad set of ideas about systemic bias and privilege — has become a political flashpoint across the nation. It holds that racism is part of a broader pattern in America: It is woven into laws, and it shows up in who gets a job interview, the sort of home loans people are offered, how they are treated by police, and other facets of daily life large and small. There is a movement by some educators to incorporate critical race theory into instruction, particularly in U.S. history which they say has been taught from a white vantage point.  A central complaint of critical race theory is that, because it focuses on race, the approach is itself racist. Critics say it presents solely a negative picture of the United States and is designed to make students feel bad about their country. At least 12 states have banned critical race theory teaching, and bills barring such instruction have been introduced in at least 15 states. The Virginia General Assembly has not considered a bill to ban critical race theory from schools. But the topic has roused emotions in a number of localities and become a key issue in Youngkin’s campaign.  So we fact-checked his claim that ""critical race theory has moved into all our schools in Virginia,"" and found it to be highly exaggerated. Critical race theory is not mentioned in Virginia’s Standards of Learning, which set baselines of knowledge students are expected to master in different grades and subjects. Although the standards are set by the state Board of Education, local school systems set the teaching curricula to reach those goals. So there is no statewide count of how many schools teach critical race theory. There’s no specific definition of critical race theory curricula that would allow an objective count. Contrary to Youngkin’s statement, however, a number of localities have issued statements saying they do not teach critical race theory. Here’s a sampling: Virginia Beach Colonial Heights Hanover County  Gloucester County  Tazewell County Loudoun County Chesterfield County Powhatan County We asked Youngkin’s campaign to back up his statement that critical race theory has ""moved into all of our schools in Virginia."" Only a smattering of the evidence it offered pointed to individual school systems or schools. Most of it shows that Virginia educators have discussed — but not endorsed — the theory at seminars and have been encouraged to read about it.  The Virginia Department of Education holds an annual two-day seminar on improving equity in schools. Equity, as defined by the department, is not a teaching theory. It’s ""a commitment to eliminating the predictability of student outcomes based on race, gender, ZIP code, ability, socio-economic status, and/or languages spoken at home,"" said Ken Blackstone, executive communications director. The goal, in simple terms, is to make schools more ""welcoming"" and ensure fair policies. Youngkin’s campaign says critical race theory has been promoted at these conferences. It notes that: In 2015, there was a presentation on critical race theory at a two-day conference on improving school disciplinary practices in Virginia. Brenda L. Walker, an education professor at the University of Central Florida, urged educators to ""embrace critical race theory"" among other recommendations. Gov. Ralph Northam, in closing remarks at the 2020 conference, said Virginia needs to ""build anti-racist school communities."" Speakers at the 2021 conference included Wendi Manuel-Scott, who teaches critical race theory at George Mason University; and Muhammad Khalifa of Ohio State and Gholdy Muhammad of Georgia State University, who advocate the theory. Here’s the other evidence cited by Youngkin’s campaign: The Virginia Department of Education has a web page titled ""Anti-racism in Education."" It cites the book ""How to be an Antiracist,"" by Ibram X. Kendi, a professor at Boston College and advocate of critical race theory. A 15-book reading list posted by the department’s Office of Equity and Community Engagement includes ""Foundations of Critical Race Theory in Education,"" written by three academics. The same book was recommended to local superintendents in a February 2019 memo by State Superintendent of Public Instruction James Lane. He sent a list of resources to help the local leaders achieve ""the ultimate goal of enhancing a climate that is welcoming, socially supportive, just, caring, nurturing, and respectful for all students, families, and school personnel.""  A Fox News report on July 2, which falsely stated that Loudoun County public schools ""spent $34K on critical race theory coaching for administrators."" In fact, receipts show the school system spent $34,167 on equity training in 2020, with $3,125 going to ""coaching support"" for leaders in critical race theory. A video of Beth Barts, a Loudoun school board member, saying that critical race theory probably influences the county’s equity efforts. ""While we are not teaching critical race theory necessarily in classrooms, I will say probably that there are portions of critical race theory that we may be applying when we give the lens to look at some of our policies,"" she said at a June 1 board meeting. A July 23, 2020, memo from Amanda Voelker, principal of James River High School in Chesterfield County. Voelker promised to promote ""a culture of inclusion that supports students of all backgrounds."" As Younkin’s campaign notes, she attached an article by Ohio-based educator Jamilah Pitts that urges teachers to let students ""apply critical lenses, such as critical race theory and Marxist theory, to the reading of news articles to allow students to think more deeply about who is being most affected and why."" A Sept, 6, 2020, tweet by John Cosimano, vice principal of Green Run High School in Virginia Beach, supporting The 1619 Project to improve teaching about the consequences of slavery and the contribution of African-Americans to U.S. history. Blackstone, the Education Department’s executive spokesman, emphasized that critical race theory is not mentioned in Virginia’s learning standards. He said opponents of the theory sometimes conflate teaching it with the state’s goals of ensuring racial equity in school policies. ""Simply put, to equate all the VDOE’s educational equity work with critical race theory is inaccurate and unfair,"" he wrote in an email. Blackstone said that discussion of critical race theory at seminars does not mean the department embraces it. ""Outside resources referenced by the department, and speakers selected for department-sponsored conferences and workshops represent a variety of viewpoints, and the inclusion of a particular author or speaker who is not a VDOE employee does not necessarily represent a department endorsement of all expressed views and opinions,"" he wrote. Youngkin said, ""We actually have this critical race theory moved into all our schools in Virginia."" Critical race theory is being widely discussed by educators across Virginia. But there's a difference between educators learning about the theory and actually teaching it to students. On that front, Youngkin cites a collection of memos and seminars, but no evidence that critical race theory is being taught in each of the state’s 1,825 public schools. Critical race theory is not mentioned in the state’s Standards of Learning. A growing list of localities say they do not teach it.  We rate Youngkin’s statement False.  ",/factchecks/2021/aug/10/glenn-youngkin/youngkin-offers-little-proof-critical-race-theory-/

Old story about Pfizer CEO’s Israel trip spreads out of context — and he’s now fully vaccinated
","Some social media users have recently been posting that the CEO of Pfizer couldn’t make a planned trip to Israel because he wasn’t fully vaccinated. The unspoken allegation: That the man in charge of a company that created one of the COVID-19 vaccines wants you to inoculate yourself against the disease but he won’t inject himself.  ""The CEO of Pfizer had to cancel a planned trip to Israel because he was not fully vaccinated,"" Newsmax writer Emerald Robinson tweeted on Aug. 5. ""Let me repeat: BECAUSE HE WAS NOT VACCINATED."" Robinson tweeted a link to a Jerusalem Post article with a similar headline: ""Pfizer CEO’s Israel visit canceled because he is not fully vaccinated""   A screenshot of that headline is also now spreading online.  ""Wait… what,"" one Aug. 6 Instagram post said. ""So he don’t even believe in his own product."" The headline is authentic.

Several hours after tweeting about the article, Robinson posted an update: ""The CEO of Pfizer announced on social media that he got his second vaccination shot on March 10,"" she said.  Albert Bourla, Pfizer’s chairman and CEO, did tweet on that day that he was ""excited"" to receive his second dose of the vaccine.  ""There’s nothing I want more than for my loved ones and people around the world to have the same opportunity,"" he said, sharing a photo of himself receiving the vaccine. ""Although the journey is far from over, we are working tirelessly to beat the virus.""  The Jerusalem Post story about Bourla canceling his trip was published online a few days earlier. The newspaper reported that ""Bourla said in December that he has not yet received the vaccine yet because he does not want to ‘cut in line,’ and would wait until his age group is next in line for getting vaccinated. As such, he has received the first dose but not the second one yet.""  This is old news that is being recirculated in a way that’s misleading, suggesting that Bourla today has not received a COVID-19 vaccine that is now widely available in the United States.

New York City requirement for COVID-19 vaccination proof not for ‘anything indoors’
","A viral image goes too far in lamenting New York City’s new requirement to show proof of COVID-19 vaccination. The image says: ""Ok so let me understand this.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) By order of Mayor Bill de Blasio, starting Aug. 16, people will be required to provide proof of COVID-19 vaccination for indoor dining, indoor fitness, and indoor entertainment and performances. The order requires at least one dose of vaccination for patrons and employees of those establishments. The order is limited to those three types of indoor venues. It does not apply, for example, to grocery stores and other essential businesses, though the city will consider adding other types of businesses, de Blasio said. It’s the first such order in the U.S., according to the New York Times. De Blasio said in announcing his order that he targeted those venues to persuade more people to get vaccinated. ""It's time for people to see vaccination as literally necessary to living a good and full and healthy life,"" he said. More than 72% of New York City adults have received at least one dose, according to the city. As for voting, registered voters in New York State do not need to show identification to vote, unless they did not provide identification with their registration. First-time voters must provide identification information either on or with their voter registration application. The proof of vaccination requirement does not apply to polling places. The same day as de Blasio’s announcement, Sen. Kevin Cramer, R-N.D., announced he would introduce legislation to require states that mandate vaccine passports, or cards showing proof of vaccination, also mandate voter identification. ""If states that take federal money for elections feel the need to make residents verify a piece of information as private as their vaccination status just to return to normalcy, then they should have no problem requiring people to prove they are who they say they are when they go to vote,"" he said in a statement. A viral image claimed that ""I will need to show proof to do anything indoors in"" New York City, ""but not when I vote?"" In New York State, including New York City, you don’t need to show identification to vote — if you are a registered voter. And proof of vaccination is not required to vote.

No truth that VAERS system shows 6,000 “died because of” COVID-19 vaccines
","A TikTok video liked more than 936,000 times claims that COVID-19 vaccines have killed some 6,000 people in the United States.  ""The Vaccine Adverse Event Recording System shows that 5,946 people have died because of the vaccine,"" the user states, referring to a government database called the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, or VAERS. The TikTok post was shared on Facebook and flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s not what VAERS shows.  In fact, there have been no established or proven cases of a COVID-19 vaccine causing death in the U.S. VAERS is run by two federal agencies, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Food and Drug Administration. It is designed so that any person can report an adverse event that occurs after a vaccination, and anyone can scour the reports. The system helps researchers collect data on vaccine after-effects and to detect patterns that may warrant a closer look. But VAERS accepts reports without verifying whether a vaccine actually caused that incident. That makes VAERS a breeding ground for misinformation that spreads quickly on social media and elsewhere. For more than 30 years, VAERS data has been misused to justify broad conclusions that vaccines are harmful.  As for COVID-19, more than 346 million doses of vaccines were administered in the U.S. from Dec. 14, 2020, through Aug. 2, 2021, according to the CDC.  During that period, VAERS received 6,490 reports of death (0.0019%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine.  But VAERS reports alone do not indicate whether a vaccine causes a particular adverse effect. They indicate only that a particular event occurred after a vaccination. Researchers can use that data as a starting point to study whether the event is linked to the vaccine. ""A review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines,"" the CDC says.

Unvaccinated people ‘not dead or sick’? False. COVID-19 is hitting them hard
","Breakthrough cases of COVID-19, in which the virus infects people who have been vaccinated, have led to confusion and even despair.

That comes out to less than one-hundredth of 1%. Similarly, according to the nonprofit Kaiser Family Foundation, among 25 states that report data on breakthrough cases, hospitalization rates among fully vaccinated people ranged from effectively 0% to 0.06%; and death rates ranged from effectively 0% to 0.01%. It’s not known how many breakthrough infections were caused by contact with an infected person who was unvaccinated. But it’s clear that unvaccinated people are being hit much harder by the virus than those who have been inoculated. Seven states with some of the lowest vaccination rates — Florida, Texas, Missouri, Arkansas, Louisiana, Alabama and Mississippi — accounted for about half of new cases and hospitalizations in the previous week, the White House said at a briefing Aug. 5.

Group falsely claims there are less than 2,000 current COVID-19 hospitalizations
","A conservative group that focuses on exposing what it describes as leftist bias in the news media misled its Facebook audience by claiming that fewer than 2,000 people are currently hospitalized in the United States with COVID-19. The post is from the Media Research Center, which runs the website Newsbusters.org. The post includes an image, which starts with ""Should this induce media panic?"":  
""What the media aren't showing you: COVID hospitalizations have decreased dramatically since last summer,"" wrote the Media Research Center, which has nearly 1.8 million Facebook followers. The chart describes laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations. It shows somewhere between 1,000 and 2,000 hospitalizations, down from a peak of more than 6,000 hospitalizations in January. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The chart cites the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as its data source.  And while the Media Research Center copied the CDC data accurately, it failed to include a very important CDC-issued disclaimer. The data in the post is drawn from just 14 states — a pool that accounts for less than 10% of the U.S. population. It includes no data from states where cases have spiked, such as Florida, Louisiana or Texas.  It’s a wildly low undercount. Let’s look at Florida by itself. The seven-day average of new hospital admissions with confirmed COVID-19 was 1,936 for July 31 to Aug. 6 — a 29.7% increase from the previous week, according to the CDC. As of Aug. 9, 13,977 inpatient beds in Florida were in use by COVID-19 patients in 251 of Florida’s hospitals — one-quarter of the inpatient beds in those hospitals, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. The number of hospitalizations is a record for the pandemic, according to the Miami Herald, which relied on data the state reports to the CDC. In Texas, more than 8,100 people were hospitalized as of Aug. 4, according to the Texas Tribune, which relies on data from the Texas Department of State Health Services. More than one-third of new COVID-19 hospitalizations came from Florida and Texas, according to the White House. None of that data is accounted for in the Media Research Center chart. So what is that CDC data? According to the CDC, it represents The Coronavirus Disease 2019-Associated Hospitalization Surveillance Network (COVID-NET). ""The current network covers nearly 100 counties in the 10 Emerging Infections Program (EIP) states (CA, CO, CT, GA, MD, MN, NM, NY, OR, and TN) and four additional states through the Influenza Hospitalization Surveillance Project (IA, MI, OH, and UT). The network represents approximately 10% of US population (~32 million people),"" the CDC writes.  The Emerging Infections Programs is a ""collaboration between CDC and 10 state health departments working with academic partners to conduct active population-based surveillance and special studies for several emerging infectious diseases with special emphasis on infectious diseases related to the key EIP activities."" The bottom line: It’s a snapshot of some data. But it’s not what the Media Research Center described. The CDC’s COVID tracker says the current seven-day average of people hospitalized with COVID-19 sits at 50,502. And the CDC notes that because of reporting delays, that figure should be repeated with caution. A chart from the Media Research Center claims there are less than 2,000 confirmed COVID-19 hospitalizations. The group looked at a sampling of data from 14 states.

Facebook post misleads on cases and outcomes among Israel’s fully vaccinated
","Israel led the world with its early and speedy vaccination campaign, but with COVID-19 infection rates on the rise there, the country now finds itself in the crosshairs of vaccine skeptics.  ""Pfizer vaccine now completely worthless in Israel as >80% of all COVID-19 patients were previously vaccinated,"" read one viral Facebook post.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post misleads by saying the vaccine is ""completely worthless"" in Israel, where cases are a fraction of the peak number in January and vaccines have been shown to protect against hospitalization and severe illness. And the claim that more than 80% of COVID-19 patients were previously vaccinated is not supported by published reports that include information from Israel’s Ministry of Health. The post is an image of a tweet from a group called COVID-19 Evidence Based Clinical Response Panel, whose Twitter account has been suspended for violating Twitter’s rules. Several news reports from U.S. and Isreali media indicate that beginning in late June and continuing until now, about 50% of new infections in Israel are in people who have been fully vaccinated.  The 50% figure appears high, but it’s not necessarily unexpected. Researchers typically expect that in places with high vaccination rates, vaccinated people will constitute a relatively high percentage of new cases.  ""The more vaccinated a population, the more we'll hear of the vaccinated getting infected,"" epidemiologist Katelyn Jetelina, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, wrote in June.  For the percentage of COVID-19 cases in vaccinated people, the post cites a chart with data for June 27 to July 3 that it says comes from the Israel Ministry of Health Dashboard. The post’s chart includes age groups, number of cases in the vaccinated, number of cases in the unvaccinated and percentage of cases in the vaccinated. We were unable to locate that chart or any single chart on the ministry’s dashboard that contains similar categories of data.  While COVID-19 infections have been on the rise in Israel, the average number of cases reported each day is currently at 38% of the peak on Jan. 16, when the highest daily average was reported, according to Reuters. Among Israelis who were fully vaccinated and experienced breakthrough infections, COVID-19 vaccines were 88% effective in preventing hospitalization and 91% effective against severe illness.  Also, among the fully vaccinated, 8 in 10 of those who had breakthrough infections did not spread the virus to others in public places such as concerts, restaurants, gyms or event halls, Health Ministry data indicated.  Misinformation about vaccine performance in Israel has been plentiful. PolitiFact recently debunked another claim that misleadingly compared COVID-19 reinfection rates among the unvaccinated and vaccinated to gauge protection against the virus.
