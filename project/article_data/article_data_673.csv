Don’t hold your breath. This isn’t a credible way to test for coronavirus
","Coronavirus test kits may be in short supply, but advice being shared on social media — including by actress Debra Messing — wrongly claims we can check ourselves for COVID-19.  ""How can one know if a person is infected?"" an image with the advice asks. ""By the time he has a fever and/or a cough and goes to the lung hospital, the patient may have 50% fibrosis, and then it’s too late! Taiwanese experts provide simple self-monitoring that we can do every morning: Take a deep breath and hold your breath for more than 10 seconds. If you can do this successfully without coughing and without difficulty, without anxiety or chest tightness, it shows that you do not have fibrosis and generally indicate no infection.""

""The only way to test for COVID-19 right now is via laboratory testing."" Loren Rauch, an ER doctor in Los Angeles, told Mother Jones that a breath test can check ""if you are anxious or have respiratory compromise,"" but not COVID-19. Robert Legar Atmar, an infectious disease specialist at Baylor College of Medicine, told the Associated Press that such a breath test could be helpful in identifying whether someone has a ""more serious lung disease.""

Sanders backed a waste-dump plan in Texas that didn’t happen
","A new video ad from a dark-money group reprises a years-old attack on Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., about one attempt to dispose of his state’s nuclear waste. The 15-second ad, which is being shared on Facebook, opens with a silent clip of Sanders speaking. A female narrator and words on the screen make this claim against the Democratic presidential candidate: ""Sen. Bernie Sanders led the effort to dump Vermont's nuclear waste on a poor Latino community in Texas."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim accurately describes Sanders’ role in leading the legislative effort. But it gives the false impression that the waste was dumped in the community. The ad is from United We Succeed, whose website describes its opposition to Sanders and contains more details about the claim we’re checking. United We Succeed calls itself a partner of the Big Tent Project Fund, which Politico described as a Democratic dark-money group aimed at boosting moderates and bashing Sanders. Dark-money groups are political nonprofits that don’t have to disclose their donors. United We Succeed did not respond to our requests for information. We reported on a similar claim during Sanders’ 2016 run for the Democratic nomination, finding: In 1998, the House approved a compact struck between Texas, Vermont and Maine that would allow Vermont and Maine to dump low-level nuclear waste in Texas. Sanders co-sponsored the bill and actively ushered it through Congress. It was widely expected the site would be in Sierra Blanca, a community about 16 miles from the Mexico border. At the time, the community was about two-thirds Latino, and its residents had an average annual income of $8,000, according to an article in the Bangor (Maine) Daily News. The low-level nuclear waste was to include ""items such as scrap metal and worker’s gloves … as well as medical gloves used in radiation treatments at hospitals,"" according to the Bangor Daily News.  Sanders’ campaign pointed out that Sierra Blanca was not specified as the site in the federal legislation, and that the legislation had overwhelming support of the legislatures, governors and voters in Texas, Maine and Vermont.  But it’s clear Sanders did help lead legislation that won approval in Congress. In reviewing the issue in 2016, when it was raised during Sanders’ first presidential run, Texas Monthly concluded that ""it’s fair to characterize Sanders’ support for the project as driven largely by a desire to see a Vermont problem resolved far from his own backyard."" Authorities in Texas ultimately rejected Sierra Blanca as the site because of safety concerns over its proximity to a geologic fault line. No nuclear waste was dumped there. In 2012, a site in Andrews County in West Texas, about 200 miles from Sierra Blanca, opened to accept the Vermont waste.  
A Facebook ad said, ""Sen. Bernie Sanders led the effort to dump Vermont's nuclear waste on a poor Latino community in Texas."" Sanders supported legislation that allowed for the dumping of nuclear waste from Vermont in Texas; the exact site wasn’t specified in the legislation, but it was widely expected to be Sierra Blanca, a low-income, largely Latino community.  But the post leaves the impression that dumping was done there, when it wasn’t.

‘Leaked documents’ don’t prove US hospitals preparing for 96 million coronavirus cases
","In a U.S. population of 329 million, is it possible that 96 million of them will suffer COVID-19? Yes, according to an infectious diseases expert who presented a webinar to members of the American Hospitals Association. But a story being shared on social media ominously refers to ""leaked documents"" and carries an alarmist headline that makes it sound as though hospitals are secretly preparing for an outbreak of that size: ""U.S. hospitals are preparing for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal,"" reads a March 7, 2020, headline on an article from the Daily Mail, a British newspaper. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) One expert addressing an American Hospital Association webinar estimated there could be 96 million coronavirus cases and 480,000 deaths in the United States. But there isn’t evidence to indicate that American hospitals are covertly preparing for an outbreak of this magnitude, as the original headline implies.  The Daily Mail says the ""leaked documents"" were obtained by Business Insider. When we contacted the Daily Mail for this fact-check, a spokesman said the headline would be changed. The headline was changed to: ""US hospitals should prepare for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal."" That is, ""are preparing"" was changed to ""should,"" but the leaked documents reference remained. Business Insider, a U.S.-based news website, also used ""leaked"" in the headline of its article, which requires a subscription to access.  Business Insider reported that it obtained slides from a webinar on COVID-19, the disease caused by the current coronavirus, that was hosted by the American Hospital Association on Feb. 26, 2020. The article said one slide, presented by Dr. James Lawler, an infectious diseases expert and internal medicine professor at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. He is director of international programs and innovation at its Global Center for Health Security.  Lawler, who has treated patients infected with the coronavirus who have been evacuated from China, estimated there could be as many 96 million coronavirus cases and 480,000 deaths in the United States.  ""Overall, the slide points out that hospitals should prepare for an impact to the system that's 10 times a severe flu season,"" the Business Insider story says. The hospital association confirmed to Business Insider that the slides it reported on were authentic. It said that the information represented the views of the experts who participated, not the association. The association told us the same thing. It did not respond to our questions about whether hospitals are preparing for coronavirus in the numbers estimated by Lawler. No other American mainstream news media have reported on the estimates, according to a Nexis search. Though clearly, with such guidance, hospitals are preparing for a large outbreak. A separate March 7, 2020, story about Lawler’s estimates in another United Kingdom-based newspaper, The Independent, said Lawler ""advised hospitals to prepare"" for an outbreak of this size. That’s a different tone than is implied by the Daily Mail headline. ""I HOPE hospitals are preparing for this,"" Lawler told PolitiFact by email. ""Word is percolating through groundswell of professional networks as people hear ground truth from Italy, but I am afraid official sources for information are way behind."" The original post said, ""U.S. hospitals are preparing for 96 million coronavirus infections and nearly half a million deaths, leaked documents reveal."" One expert estimated at an American Hospital Association webinar that there could be 96 million coronavirus cases and 480,000 deaths in the United States.  But these supposedly ""leaked"" documents were slides presented by one epidemiologist during a webinar to members of the American Hospital Association. They don’t represent some official attempt to conceal information, as the original Daily Mail headline, later changed, suggests. They also don’t provide evidence that hospitals are preparing for coronavirus cases in those numbers, though clearly this information is being used as guidance for hospitals’ preparations.

Fox & Friends host says now is ‘the safest time to fly.’ It’s not
","Since the outbreak of COVID-19, airline stocks have plummeted. Companies like Delta, American and United have cut or reduced flights. Photos show empty airport terminals around the world. On March 13, Fox & Friends co-host Ainsley Earhardt took those signs to mean that now is a great time to take a trip. ""It’s actually the safest time to fly,"" she said during the Fox News morning show. ""Everyone I know that’s flying right now, terminals are pretty much dead — ghost towns."" As of March 12, more than 125,000 people have been infected with COVID-19 in 117 countries, with 4,613 deaths. In the United States, there have been 1,629 confirmed cases in 46 states, with 41 deaths. In a March 11 address, President Donald Trump announced a sweeping ban on travel from 26 European countries. While the White House maintains the move will slow the spread of the coronavirus, some experts doubt the restrictions will have much of an effect. PolitiFact wanted to know whether Earhardt was correct to say that now is the safest time to fly.  We reached out to Earhardt for evidence, but we haven’t heard back. Official guidance on COVID-19 contradicts what she said on Fox News. Officials are advising older Americans and those with chronic health conditions to reconsider their domestic and international travel plans to avoid COVID-19. On its website, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says there are ""several things you should consider when deciding whether it is safe for you to travel"" in the U.S., including: Is COVID-19 spreading where you’re going? Will you or someone you’re traveling with be in close contact with others during your trip? Are you or someone you’re traveling with at risk of severe illness if you get COVID-19? Do you live with someone who is older or has a severe chronic health condition? Is COVID-19 spreading where you live? If the answer to any of those questions is yes, then you may want to reconsider your travel plans to avoid potentially spreading or contracting the virus. ""CDC’s recommendations differ depending on the location,"" said agency spokeswoman Leslie Dorigo in an email. ""CDC recommends that older adults and people of any age with serious chronic medical conditions should consider postponing nonessential travel because they are at increased risk for severe disease."" That’s because older and immunocompromised people, as well as those with chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension, are more at risk of suffering complications from COVID-19. Younger people, even though they may not be as susceptible to the coronavirus, can still serve as carriers for the virus, potentially infecting new communities through travel. RELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump’s mistakes about European travel due to coronavirus The World Health Organization has similar guidance for international travelers, although it advises against travel bans like the one implemented by the Trump administration. ""It is prudent for travellers who are sick to delay or avoid travel to affected areas, in particular for elderly travellers and people with chronic diseases or underlying health conditions,"" read its recommendations. ""General recommendations for personal hygiene, cough etiquette and keeping a distance of at least one metre from persons showing symptoms remain particularly important for all travellers."" The U.S. State Department is advising all citizens to reconsider travel abroad due to the spread of COVID-19. Other countries have issued similar travel warnings. Since January, the State Department has issued several travel advisories related to the COVID-19 outbreak. As of March 13, China and Iran had ""Level 4: Do Not Travel"" advisories — the highest issued by the State Department — while countries like Azerbaijan, Italy and South Korea were labeled as ""Level 3: Reconsider Travel."" On March 11, the State Department also issued a global health advisory asking Americans to reconsider traveling abroad. Source: WHO ""Many areas throughout the world are now experiencing COVID-19 outbreaks and taking action that may limit traveler mobility, including quarantines and border restrictions,"" reads the Level 3 advisory. ""Even countries, jurisdictions, or areas where cases have not been reported may restrict travel without notice."" Other countries, such as the United Kingdom and Australia, have issued similar travel advisories. ""It may not be safe to fly, especially if you’re going to one of the COVID-19 hotspots,"" said Richard Watanabe, professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, in an email. ""Generally speaking, it is just unwise to be traveling in any form right now."" If you do have to travel via airplane, you’re unlikely to get sick while on board, officials say — as long as you practice good hygiene. The WHO says there is little risk of disease transmission during a flight, mostly due to the way cabin air is filtered. During the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), another human coronavirus, in 2003, the risk of disease transmission on airplanes was found to be very low. Plus, airlines are taking extra steps to clean airplanes and slow the spread of COVID-19. ""Airlines are being more cautious about passengers, they’re doing extra cleaning and disinfecting and they are restricting flights,"" Watanabe said. ""So one might consider flying to be safer than ever."" Still, it is possible to catch something from an infected person seated in the same area as you. RELATED: Stop sharing myths about preventing the coronavirus. Here are 4 real ways to protect yourself According to the CDC, COVID-19 spreads in two primary ways: close person-to-person contact (within about six feet) and respiratory droplets in coughs and sneezes. If someone with the virus sneezes, those germs could land on surfaces around them, such as airplane seats and armrests. Then, an uninfected person who touches that same surface and then touches their nose, eyes or mouth could contract the virus. If you do need to travel by plane, public health officials advise practicing good personal hygiene. The ways to prevent the spread of the coronavirus include washing your hands with soap and water, covering coughs and sneezes, disinfecting frequently touched surfaces, and avoiding people who are sick. ""We are trying to understand the ‘rules’ that govern transmission of COVID-19 and relative risk from people at different stages of disease, and/or contaminated surfaces and more,"" said Dr. Myron Cohen, director of the Institute for Global Health and Infectious Diseases at the University of North Carolina, in an email. ""It seems unwise for commentators to offer travel advice until we who are more expert know far more."" Earhardt said that ""it's actually the safest time to fly."" Officials from the CDC and WHO are advising older people and those with chronic health conditions to reconsider travel in order to prevent the spread of the coronavirus. The State Department has issued travel advisories for several individual countries, as well as a global health advisory, related to the disease outbreak. Other countries have taken similar steps. While the disease transmission on airplanes is thought to be a low risk, it is still possible to contract the coronavirus through close personal contact and respiratory droplets.

Video doesn't show Joe Biden promising to 'take away Americans’ guns'
","The day before Super Tuesday, Beto O’Rourke said he is endorsing former Vice President Joe Biden in the Democratic presidential primary. At a Dallas rally, Biden thanked O’Rourke, a former rival for the nomination, for his support and told attendees: ""This is not the last you’ve seen of this guy."" ""You’re going to take care of the gun problem with me,"" Biden told O’Rourke, the former Democratic congressman from El Paso, on stage. ""You’re going to be the one who leads this effort. I’m counting on you."" During his own presidential campaign, which ended in November, O’Rourke called for mandatory buybacks of assault style weapons. He famously said during the Sept. 12 debate in Houston: ""Hell yes, we are going to take your AR-15, your AK-47."" Opponents of the proposal have taken O’Rourke’s endorsement, and Biden’s comments about a possible leadership role for O’Rourke, to mean that Biden now supports mandatory buybacks of assault style weapons — a policy he has not backed in the past. Conservative-Daily, an online platform featuring articles with a conservative slant, said in a recent post that Biden has been explicit in his support of the buyback program, which has been equated with ""confiscation"" by gun rights advocates. The post is titled ""Watch: Biden Looks Into The Camera And Promises To Take Away Americans’ Guns"" and includes a 15-second clip cut from a longer Facebook live video of Biden and O’Rourke talking with O’Rourke’s wife Amy O’Rourke at a Whataburger after the Dallas rally. In the clip, Biden says: ""This guy can change the face of what we’re dealing with, with regard to guns, assault weapons, with regard to dealing with climate change. And I’m just warning Amy: If I win, I’m coming for him."" The post states that the video shows Biden agreeing to adopt O’Rourke’s ""most radical gun control proposals."" ""This is a video of Joe Biden looking directly into the camera and promising to take away Americans’ guns if elected,"" the post reads. ""And he had the audacity to make this promise in Texas …"" When asked for clarification, Max McGuire, author of the post, said he heard Biden differently in the video. Instead of saying ""I’m coming for him,"" McGuire said Biden can be heard saying, ""if he wins he is coming for ‘em,’ which we interpreted to mean guns, given the fact that seconds earlier he was praising Beto's gun control advocacy re: assault weapons."" For the record, multiple viewings of the video confirm that Biden is directing his remark to O’Rourke’s wife when he says: ""If I win, I’m coming for him."" He also gestures toward O’Rourke. FactCheck.org also reviewed the video and reported that Biden said ""I’m coming for him,"" in reference to O’Rourke. The footage has been fact-checked by Reuters, which came to the same conclusion about Biden’s remarks. No role for O'Rourke in Biden's camp But McGuire said if Biden had said ""I’m coming for him,"" that means he plans to hire O’Rourke to be part of his administration. ""If he said 'coming for him,' we contend that there is no difference in intention,"" he said. ""Beto O'Rourke has made his gun control intentions clear. If he had been elected, he promised whole-heartedly that ‘hell yes’ he would be coming for Americans' guns. Joe Biden has since made his intention clear to have Beto run his campaign's and/or administration's gun control policy."" But that is inaccurate. Biden did say O’Rourke would work with him on gun policy, but in an interview O’Rourke said he does not have a role in Biden’s campaign and that he has not spoken with Biden or his team about what role he could play in a future administration. O’Rourke also said Biden has not expressed support for his gun safety policies. ""I have not heard him say he would support a mandatory buyback of assault weapons,"" O’Rourke said. Biden’s campaign did not respond to multiple requests for comment, so we turned to his platform on guns and recent public remarks he has made to assess whether his position on mandatory buybacks has shifted. Biden’s platform on guns calls for a ban on the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high capacity magazines and the establishment of a voluntary program to buy back those weapons already in peoples’ possession. ""This will give individuals who now possess assault weapons or high-capacity magazines two options: sell the weapons to the government, or register them under the National Firearms Act,"" his website reads. In a heated exchange with an auto worker in Detroit on Tuesday, a week after receiving O’Rourke’s endorsement, Biden rejected the idea that he supported taking guns away from people. In a video of the exchange, the man can be heard telling Biden: ""You are actively trying to diminish our Second Amendment right and take away our guns."" Biden told the man that he was ""full of shit"" and added, ""I'm not taking your gun away — at all."" The man cited a video circulating online that shows Biden saying he is ""trying to take our guns."" Biden responded: ""I did not say that. I did not say that. It’s a viral video like the other ones they’re putting out that are simply a lie."" Our Ruling A blog post from Conservative Daily says a video of Biden and O’Rourke at a burger joint in Texas shows Biden ""looking directly into the camera and promising to take away Americans’ guns if elected."" Biden does not say this in the video included in the blog post. The video shows Biden issuing a joking warning to Amy O’Rourke, Beto O’Rourke’s wife, that if Biden is elected, he will be ""coming for him"" — meaning Beto O’Rourke. O’Rourke said he has no formal role in Biden’s campaign and has not spoken with Biden’s team about a job in a potential future administration.

The facts behind Joe Biden’s claim on deportations under Obama
","Since former Vice President Joe Biden is proud of the working relationship he had with President Barack Obama, does Biden also take responsibility for Obama-era deportations? Univision’s Jorge Ramos asked Biden that during an interview aired live Feb. 14 on the ""Real America with Jorge Ramos"" Facebook page. Biden, who is seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, said the deportations were a ""big mistake"" and that they ""took too long to get it right."" But he also claimed that deportations under Obama weren’t as high as they were under the two prior presidents George W. Bush and Bill Clinton. Here’s part of their exchange: Biden: ""Look, you had the last two administrations deport twice as many people as we deported — twice as many."" Ramos: ""Your administration deported 3 million people. More than ever."" Biden: ""No, no, no, because you had more people deported in the W administration, Bush and the Clinton administration."" Ramos: ""I’m sorry, Mr. Vice President, but the numbers that I have from the Department of Homeland Security, you deported more than 3 million people, 1.7 (million) of them with no criminal record."" Biden: ""But there were 5 million deported in the Bush administration, and more than that in the administration of Clinton."" Ramos: ""I got to check those numbers."" PolitiFact also decided to check Biden’s numbers. We found that Biden is right by one method of counting and wrong by another. Biden is right that Bush and Clinton deported twice as many people — if one is counting the number of people formally removed plus the number of people turned away at the southwest border in a less formal process. But Biden is wrong if one only looks at the number of people deported under a removal order, a formal process that may involve a court order — and that’s the number that Ramos was citing. Biden’s campaign told PolitiFact that Biden was referring to the broader deportation number. Immigration experts told us both metrics can be used to quantify deportations. They just tell different stories. ""Biden’s statement is (either) an exaggeration or an understatement depending on how you want to look at it,"" said Bill O. Hing, a professor and director of the Immigration and Deportation Defense Clinic at the University of San Francisco. The Migration Policy Institute in January 2017 published a report on the immigration enforcement records of Obama, Bush and Clinton. (Fiscal years in the analysis: Clinton, 1993-2000; Bush, 2001-2008; Obama, 2009-2016.) The nonpartisan research group collected data from the Department of Homeland Security and tallied about 5.3 million total deportations during the Obama administration, around 10.3 million during Bush’s tenure, and about 12.3 million under Clinton’s presidency. Those numbers are the sum of removals and returns. ""Removals"" refer to the formal deportation of individuals, they include court-ordered removals and expedited removals without judicial review. The removals data includes people who lived in the United States and got picked up by immigration authorities within the country. ""Returns"" refer to a procedure that allows individuals at the border to be returned to their home country without being placed in formal removal proceedings. It does not carry the same penalties as a removal. ""If you want to look at total deportations, it's absolutely true that Clinton and Bush had  more than the Obama-Biden administration,"" said Randy Capps, director of research of U.S. Programs at the Migration Policy Institute. ""However, the vast majority of deportations under Clinton and Bush were at the border,"" Capps said. ""During the Obama-Biden administration, there were far more interior arrests and deportations of people who were already in the country."" The MPI report defines deportation as ""a general, nontechnical term describing the movement of a noncitizen out of the United States through either a formal removal or a return."" The Department of Homeland Security defines deportation as ""the formal removal of an alien from the United States when the alien has been found removable for violating the immigration laws."" The MPI found that Obama’s administration made around 3.1 million removals, compared with about 2 million under Bush and about 870,000 under Clinton. Returns at the border were much higher under Bush and Clinton because there were more apprehensions, Capps said. When Bush and Clinton were in office there were usually more than 1 million apprehensions per fiscal year. They began declining in 2007 around the recession; during Obama’s tenure there were on average 400,000 apprehensions a year. During the Bush and Clinton administrations, almost all of the people arrested at the southwest border were Mexican and were returned without a formal deportation charge. During Obama’s presidency, there was a surge in Central American families and unaccompanied children arriving at the border seeking asylum and placed in formal proceedings. By the time Obama got to the White House there was also a more robust deportation system in place set up by the Bush administration and continued by Obama. Those enforcement programs included 287(g), Secure Communities, the Criminal Alien Program, and Operation Streamline. After being criticized as ""deporter in chief"" in 2014 by immigrant advocates, the Obama administration set new deportation policies, making people without criminal records and those who had been in the country for a long time lower deportation priorities. Biden said, ""You had the last two administrations deport twice as many people as we deported — twice as many."" Biden is accurate by one metric, but wrong by another. The number of people sent back to their countries based on returns at the border and formal removal orders was at least twice as high during Bush and Clinton. But deportations based only on formal removals were higher under Obama compared with Bush and Clinton.

The Japanese film Akira did not predict the coronavirus outbreak
","The coronavirus is a global pandemic, according to the World Health Organization. But it is not one that was predicted by the 1988 Japanese thriller ""Akira."" A viral post circulating on Facebook claims that a conspiracy theory surrounds Katsuhiro Otomo’s 32-year-old animated film.  ""‘Akira’ is a 1988 movie about an apocalyptic event taking place months before Tokyo 2020 Olympics, showing the WHO advising Japan to postpone the Olympics because of a pandemic risk,"" reads the first panel of the image. The post, which had been shared more than 32,000 times as of March 11, makes it seem as though ""Akira"" predicted an outbreak like that of the coronavirus decades ago. But almost none of its claims are true. Yes, in ""Akira"" the city of Neo Tokyo is scheduled to host the 2020 Olympic games. Neo Tokyo is the name of the city built after Tokyo was destroyed by a massive bomb in 1988 at the very beginning of the film. At one point, a scene identifies that the Olympics’ Opening Ceremonies are 147 days away, but the Olympics are only mentioned a handful of times throughout the movie. In fact, the final battle takes place at the Olympic stadium, but the Olympics are not central to the plot of the film.  The film, which is available to watch on Hulu in both an English-dubbed version and a Japanese version with English subtitles, is an adaptation of Otomo’s popular comic book series. It tells the story of a teenage biker gang that roams the streets looking for trouble, until the group accidentally gets caught up in a secret government experiment that involves children with psychic abilities.  The plot is complex and culminates in an epic battle against an overwhelming energy force, but there is no outbreak of disease. The WHO was not present and not mentioned at any point in the film. The topic of canceling the Olympics was never discussed on screen, though when Mashable Southeast Asia looked into this conspiracy, they reported that some of the graffiti on the sign that counts down to the opening ceremonies reads, ""Just cancel it,"" in Japanese. Furthermore, the ""apocalyptic event"" the post seems to refer to occurs within the first two minutes of the film. A massive explosion destroys Tokyo, but this takes place in 1988 before the film jumps in time to 2019.   Our ruling A social media post claims that the film ""Akira"" shows ""the WHO advising Japan to postpone the Olympics because of a pandemic risk."" In the film, there is no outbreak of disease, the WHO never makes an appearance, and the Olympics aren’t canceled due to a pandemic risk.

","A Facebook post critical of illegal immigration — comparing two construction workers, ""Joe legal"" and ""Jose illegal"" — has been shared more than 222,000 times since it was created in July 2018, and it’s still circulating.   But the post is rife with inaccuracies. You can read the full text of the 553-word post here. But here’s a sampling: ""Joe legal works in construction, has a Social Security number and makes $25.00 per hour with taxes deducted. ""Jose illegal also works in construction has no Social Security number and makes $15.00 per hour cash, under the table. ... ""Joe legal pays medical and dental insurance with limited coverage for his family at $600.00 per month, or $7,200.00 per year. Joe legal now has $24,031.00. ""Jose illegal has full medical and dental coverage through the State and local clinics and emergency hospitals at a cost of $0.00 per year. Jose illegal still has $31,200.00. ""Joe legal makes too much money and is not eligible for food stamps or welfare. Joe legal spends $500.00 per month for food or $6,000.00 per year. Joe legal now has $18,031.00. ""Jose illegal has no documented income and is eligible for food stamps, WIC and welfare. Jose illegal still has $31,200.00. ... ""Now, when they reach college age... ""Joe legal's kids may not get into a State school and may not qualify for scholarships, grants or other tuition help, even though Joe has been paying for State schools through his taxes, while... ""Jose illegal's kids go to the, 'head of the class' because they are a minority. ... ""Its way PAST time to take a stand for America and Americans!"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Much of the post is wrong. Here’s an analysis of the major points. Actually, many undocumented immigrants do pay taxes. This has been especially true in recent years, as most key immigration bills included provisions that would require paying taxes as a prerequisite for securing legal status. The most common mechanism may involve the Individual Taxpayer Identification Number, or ITIN. Since 1996, people in the United States who do not have a Social Security number, and who therefore aren’t eligible to be employed, have been able to get an ITIN. Many, though not all, ITIN filers are undocumented immigrants, experts say. In 2013, 4.3 million people filed tax returns using ITINs. ITIN filers paid $9 billion in payroll taxes in 2014. A 2013 report by the conservative Heritage Foundation found that the average undocumented immigrant household paid $10,334 in taxes, or $17.6 billion paid overall. Experts estimate that half of all undocumented workers pay federal income taxes, Kim Rueben, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, told PolitiFact in 2016. That’s not much below the rate of Americans as a whole, since many Americans earn too little to owe federal income taxes. Then there are payroll taxes. The Social Security Administration estimated that in 2009, 3.1 million unauthorized workers paid into Social Security via payroll tax, even though most will not be able to collect those benefits. Beyond that are state and local taxes. A 2016 study by the liberal Institute on Taxation & Economic Policy estimated that in 2013, undocumented immigrants paid $11.64 billion in state and local taxes, such as sales and excise taxes, property taxes, and income taxes. This is largely wrong, though there are a few exceptions. In July 2019, California approved state-funded Medicaid coverage for low-income, undocumented adults age 25 and younger. A half-dozen states and the District of Columbia use state funds to provide Medicaid to children regardless of immigration status. Elsewhere, and for other age groups, undocumented immigrants only have access to emergency care. In 1986, Congress responded to concerns that emergency rooms were refusing to treat indigent and uninsured people — a practice known as patient dumping — by approving the Emergency Medical Treatment and Active Labor Act. The act, signed by President Ronald Reagan, requires hospitals with emergency rooms that participate in the Medicare program to medically screen, treat and stabilize any patient (including illegal immigrants) who shows up with an emergency medical condition. The law doesn't require that hospitals offer preventive or follow-up care. (Joe legal can get emergency care this way, too, should he need it.)  Undocumented immigrants are unable to obtain federal premium subsidies on the Affordable Care Act marketplaces. So in most states, short of an emergency situation, they’re going to have to pay in full for private medical insurance if they want to get routine or preventive care, just like Joe legal would. Undocumented immigrants are ineligible for most federal benefits. There are a few exceptions — including the emergency disaster assistance and Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children, or WIC. They are barred from programs such as Supplemental Security Income or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families. Not even individuals protected with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status — that is, those who came to the United States without authorization as children and who remain undocumented — qualify for these benefits. There are two asterisks to note.  FIrst, an undocumented immigrant may have a spouse or relatives who are citizens and who are eligible for such programs. But any benefit to the undocumented immigrant would be indirect, and it is legal for a citizen to receive those benefits. Second, it’s possible that an undocumented immigrant could fraudulently apply for such benefits. Ruth Wasem, a professor at the University of Texas’ Lyndon B. Johnson school of public policy, said there are no good estimates of the rates of fraud in these programs by undocumented immigrants. However, she’s skeptical that they are especially high. ""Do people commit fraud? Of course,"" she said. ""But why is someone who is trying to keep a low profile to avoid deportation going to risk that kind of behavior? And to the extent that there is fraud and identity theft in these programs, it’s nothing that U.S. citizens aren’t doing in abundance."" Experts could not think of any way in which an undocumented immigrant would get a leg up in college admissions or financial aid. The only possible exception would be generalized affirmative action preferences — but even this is not as simple as the Facebook post puts it. Specifically, under affirmative action, ""Jose illegal"" would be on the same footing for attending and paying for college as legal immigrants of color and U.S. citizens of color.  Indeed, ""Joe legal"" could be a person of color, putting him on the same affirmative action footing as ""Joe illegal."" The Facebook post compared two construction workers — ""Joe legal"" and ""Jose illegal"" — and said ""Jose"" pays no taxes yet gets free medical care, food stamps, welfare, and ""head of the class"" priority for his children in applying for college. The post ignores that many undocumented immigrants do, in fact, pay income taxes, payroll taxes, and state and local taxes. It also ignores that most undocumented immigrants cannot legally claim federal benefits, such as food stamps and welfare. Finally, experts said there’s no way an undocumented immigrant would get placed at the head of the line for college admissions or financial aid compared with U.S. citizens and even legal immigrants. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2020/mar/13/facebook-posts/post-comparing-joe-legal-and-jose-illegal-rife-ina/

Yes, auto theft is up in most large Wisconsin counties, though down statewide
","The issue of reckless driving has gained urgency as lawmakers, police and residents grapple with how to get a handle on increasing danger on neighborhood streets.  One approach: Crack down on auto theft. In Milwaukee and elsewhere, the police pursuit of stolen vehicles has led to accidents, including a Feb. 1, 2020 incident in Wauwatosa, when a stolen car being pursued by Milwaukee police crashed into a tree. State Sen. Chris Kapenga, R-Delafield, introduced a bill to address auto theft that, among other things, increases penalties for reckless driving, fleeing an officer and vehicle theft. The measure won Senate approval Feb. 19, 2020 on a 19-14 vote and was sent to the Assembly.  In a news release that day, Kapenga argued: ""Reckless driving and car thefts have been a major issue not only in Milwaukee County but also across the state with car thefts increasing in 8 of the 10 most populous counties.""  Is Kapenga right? When asked for backup, Kapenga’s chief of staff Kyle Koenen pointed to the Wisconsin Department of Justice’s  Uniform Crime Reporting Database.  Based on the database, here’s a look at the state’s 10 most populous counties and their motor vehicle theft counts in 2014 and 2018 -- a five-year period: So two of the top 10 counties -- Milwaukee and Kenosha -- had decreases in car thefts, while eight had increases.  At the same time, Kapenga is doing a bit of cherry-picking in terms of the data he is citing to boost support for his bill. He describes auto theft as a statewide problem, but a look at statewide figures for motor vehicle thefts shows a 14.2% drop -- from 9,811 in 2014 to 8,416 in 2018.  Law enforcement officials and experts consider auto theft a ""gateway"" crime that is often tied to other criminal activity. Here is a quote from the 2006 book ""Forensic Investigation of Stolen-Recovered and Other Crime-Related Vehicles,"" which is described as a reference guide for auto theft investigators: ""Auto theft is often the first crime engaged in by juvenile offenders who go on to a career of committing other crimes. Stolen vehicles are often used in burglaries, armed robberies and other crimes."" In a 2018 interview with the website Pursuit Response, Chris McDonold, chair of a committee of the International Association of Chiefs of Police that focuses on vehicle crimes, said ""97 percent of car thieves also face other serious charges."" ""The first step of violent crime and high-impact crime begins with stolen vehicles,"" he said. ""You need stolen vehicles for crimes like shootings, robberies, homicides, drug dealing and insurance fraud."" In seeking support for a bill he introduced, Kapenga said ""car thefts (are) increasing in 8 of the 10 most populous counties.""  State data shows that, among the most populous counties, only Milwaukee and Kenosha saw a drop in a recent five-year period. But in choosing those counties to make his point, Kapenga is sidestepping the fact statewide data shows vehicle thefts are down. Our definition of Mostly True is ""the statement is accurate, but needs clarification or additional information."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2020/mar/12/chris-kapanga/yes-auto-theft-most-large-wisconsin-counties-thoug/

Can Europeans get around Trump travel ban by going to England first? Not so simple
","House Speaker Nancy Pelosi questioned whether it made sense for the Trump administration to stop travel from certain countries in Europe — but not the United Kingdom — in order to stop the spread of the coronavirus. At Pelosi’s weekly press conference, a reporter asked if she thought the administration’s travel ban was ""wise."" Pelosi said she had spoken with Vice President Mike Pence and Dr. Anthony Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, and was told it was a ""scientific medical decision."" ""I have great confidence in Dr. Fauci. It's just strange, because they're saying it's because it's easy to travel among these countries. But they're separate from the U.K.,"" Pelosi said. ""Well, you can just get in the Chunnel, and you'll be in the U.K. Again, it's a decision they made. It has its ramifications. We'll see whether it's worth the trouble."" Pelosi said she wasn’t there to criticize President Donald Trump’s decisions, but emphasized that testing would be ""the only way"" to learn how the virus is spreading. PolitiFact wanted to take a closer look at Pelosi’s comments about travel in Europe and how it relates to the details in Trump’s proclamation. Trump’s proclamation seeks to restrict ""all aliens who were physically present within the Schengen Area during the 14-day period preceding their entry or attempted entry into the United States."" U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents and their close relatives are exempt from the ban. So are numerous categories of other people. The Schengen Area covers European states that agree to free movement among their nations without border checks. Countries in the zone include Austria, Belgium, and France (here’s the full list). The United Kingdom — England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland — is not part of the Schengen Area. (Neither is the Republic of Ireland, a member of the European Union that borders Northern Ireland.) When Pelosi said ""well, you can just get in the Chunnel, and you'll be in the U.K,,"" she was referring to the Channel Tunnel (Chunnel is the short name) that runs under the English Channel linking England and France. People move from one country to the other via trains. However, even if someone gets from France to the United Kingdom, they can’t get on a plane right away and come to the United States, since Trump’s proclamation bars people who had been in Schengen Area two weeks before. People from the United Kingdom who traveled to a Schengen Area state in the two weeks before their attempted travel to the United States would presumably be barred entry, unless they qualify for the exemptions. Pelosi didn’t say that a person could cross the Chunnel and then immediately travel from the United Kingdom to the United States, said Henry V. Connelly, Pelosi’s deputy communications director. ""The point is that, with the ease of travel between the U.K. and the continent, there’s not a meaningful difference in risk of the community spread of coronavirus between the two — and thus, not much difference in the coronavirus risk from a person from the U.K. or from inside Schengen Area,"" Connelly said. Speaking of Trump’s Europe travel restriction exempting the United Kingdom, Pelosi said, ""Well you can just get into the Chunnel, and you’ll be in the U.K."" It isn't that easy to get around the restrictions by taking a train linking England and France. The travel ban applies to people who were in the Schengen Area 14 days before their attempted travel to the United States. So someone in France who traveled to England would not be immediately exempt from the restrictions.  Pelosi’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Sanders’ misleading Social Security attack on Biden
","Leading up to the primary in Florida, with its many retirees, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., is pressing Joe Biden hard on his past stands on Social Security.  Sanders’ current ad in heavy rotation in Florida has a picture of Biden under the words ""Biden has advocated cutting Social Security for 40 years."" The ad plays audio of Biden from 1995 saying, ""When I argued that we should freeze federal spending, I meant Social Security as well. I meant Medicare and Medicaid. I meant veterans benefits. I meant every single solitary thing in the government. And I not only tried it once, I tried it twice, I tried it a third time, and I tried it a fourth time."" We’ve reviewed Biden’s past statements on Social Security before. Our focus here is on the specific claim that he has pushed for cuts for 40 years. A plain reading of that would be that Biden consistently sought to reduce benefit payments for most of his career. The reality is that Biden’s position has changed over time.  In roughly 10-year hops, starting in the 1970s, he went from calling for a 7% increase, then for a one-year freeze, then floated raising the retirement age, then backed a change in how benefits would increase, and has ended up today calling for higher benefits.  In 1973, as a first-term senator, Biden co-sponsored a bill to increase monthly benefits by 7%. During the 1980s and 1990s, Biden spoke in favor of freezes to Social Security as part of an effort to rein in all spending to reduce the deficit. ""The only way that Congress will ever be able to come to grips with deficits is by dealing with all federal programs as a package,"" Biden said in 1984. In 1984, Biden co-sponsored a proposal with two GOP senators to broadly freeze federal spending. The proposal would have meant no Social Security cost-of-living adjustments for one year, but it was defeated. In 1995, Biden voted in favor of an amendment to exclude reducing Social Security benefits in any legislation to implement a balanced-budget amendment. But Biden ultimately supported the balanced-budget amendment when its final form didn’t include the exemption. In 1996, Biden suggested cutting the cost-of-living adjustment by one percentage point. He also supported a balanced-budget amendment that many saw as a backdoor to cuts in Social Security. In 2003, Biden sponsored a Senate resolution opposing cuts in the cost-of-living increases for Social Security benefits. When he ran for president in 2007, in an interview with NBC, Biden said the retirement age and cost-of-living adjustments had to ""be on the table"" in negotiations on stabilizing Social Security.  But a few months later during a Democratic presidential debate, Biden backed away from changing the retirement age. He said he would support raising the income cap for the Social Security tax, which was then $97,500; that would be enough to avert other changes, he argued. ""The truth is, you’re either going to cut benefits or you’re going to go ahead and raise taxes above the first $97,000,"" Biden said Sept. 26, 2007. As vice president, Biden was drawn back into fights over the future of Social Security amid efforts to reduce federal deficits. A 2010 presidential commission on the deficit had proposed Social Security cuts that President Barack Obama rejected. The 2011 Budget Control Act set deficit reduction targets. If they were not met, automatic cuts, called sequestration, kicked in. In hammering out that bill, the Obama White House and Democrats ensured that sequestration would not touch Social Security.  In 2012, Biden promised voters in Virginia: ""I guarantee you, flat guarantee you: There will be no changes in Social Security. I flat guarantee you.""  But during the Obama years, Biden did have a hand in a proposal that would have reduced Social Security benefits over time. It involved a different way of calculating inflation, using something called chained CPI. According to a recent report from the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank, such a change today would reduce the mean Social Security benefit by about 4.5% over a span of 45 years. In deficit reduction negotiations with a Republican-controlled Congress, the Obama White House said it was ready to accept a shift to the chained CPI as part of a larger budget deal. Opposition from Democratic lawmakers killed the proposal in 2011 and 2014, and it never went forward.  In this election, Biden has called for ""urgently needed action to make the program solvent and prevent cuts to American retirees."" Biden would increase the minimum benefit for lifelong workers and make payments for the oldest people more generous. To shore up Social Security’s finances, he would raise taxes on upper-income households, although his plan doesn’t say by how much. ""We should be increasing, not decreasing, Social Security,"" Biden said at an AARP Iowa forum in July.  Recently, the Sanders campaign argued that in 2018, Biden had endorsed proposals by former Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan to cut Social Security benefits. We rated that False, but in his complete remarks at the time, Biden did say Social Security ""still needs adjustments."" The Sanders ad drew on an article that said the word ""adjustments"" is ""a Washington euphemism for cuts."" If that’s the case, the same could be said of Sanders. The Associated Press found that in 1996, Sanders said the aging of America’s population would require changes in Social Security. ""It is clear that we will have to make incremental adjustments in Social Security taxes and benefits — as Congress has done in the past,"" Sanders wrote in an op-ed. Sanders said that Biden advocated for Social Security cuts for 40 years. The record is much more nuanced than that. Over his decades in the Senate, Biden generally pushed to protect Social Security, but he also supported ideas that would reduce Social Security benefits over time. The audio in the Sanders ad of Biden calling for a total freeze on government spending dates back 25 years. About 13 years ago, Biden said he was open to benefit reductions, and then a few months later, said increasing taxes was better than reducing benefits. During the Obama administration, he was on board with a proposal that would have reduced benefits about four percentage points over four decades. That was in the context of a sweeping budget deal, and ultimately, it went nowhere. But also during those years, Biden was part of efforts to protect Social Security from automatic cuts under sequestration. Biden’s current policy is to increase Social Security benefits. The claim contains elements of truth, but leaves out important facts that would give a different impression.

‘The View’ co-host Joy Behar wrongly says Trump shut down 37 global anti-pandemic programs
","Joy Behar, a co-host of ABC’s ""The View,"" accused President Donald Trump of dismantling anti-pandemic programs the Obama administration set up across the globe. Barack Obama ""set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus, exactly,"" Behar said during the March 9 episode of the show. ""Do you know that Trump closed 37 of them?"" The TV host’s claim is wrong, and it’s not entirely clear how she got her numbers, either.  Trump did fail to replace top national-security officials in charge of coordinating the U.S. response to pandemics, and he unsuccessfully sought to cut funding for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. But he never slashed the programs Behar was referring to, however. As the Washington Post noted, there were concerns among global-health leaders that U.S. funding for an initiative known as the Global Health Security Agenda was running out, and that some U.S.-run pandemic-prevention programs would have to be downsized as a result.  But the Trump administration never pulled the plug on those programs, although it did propose smaller budgets. Congress has injected more money into them in recent budget requests. One day after we reached out to ABC for comment, Behar made a tongue-in-cheek correction on air. ""The other day, I mistakenly said that Trump shut down anti-pandemic programs that Obama had set up in nearly 40 countries,"" Behar said. ""I’m happy to say, he only attempted to cut funding for them, but that did not ultimately go into effect. Isn’t that good?"" The CDC has been operating public-health programs in a number of foreign countries as part the Global Health Security Agenda, which the United States helped launch in 2014. The initiative — which now includes 67 countries — is a global effort to help countries reduce the risk of infectious diseases.  The bulk of its early funding came from a one-time, five-year emergency spending bill that Congress approved in late 2014 to respond to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa. The package appropriated almost $600 million for the CDC ""to support national public health institutes and global health security."" The CDC had hoped those funds would be replenished once the five-year supplement expired in October 2019, according to reports. But as the expiration date approached, it looked like the agency could be left with just the core annual budget to pull from. National news outlets reported in the spring of 2018 that the CDC was bracing for a possible funding drop-off. The CDC planned to scale back operations in 39 of 49 countries and focus on 10 ""priority countries,"" according to emails reviewed by the Wall Street Journal. In the end, however, Congress provided enough funding to sustain the programs, experts told us. (The White House and CDC did not respond to our requests for comment. The CDC told Factcheck.org it ""did not have to cut back its work"" to 10 countries.) ""The president's budget proposed slashing funding for CDC's (global health security) initiatives,"" added Claire Standley, an assistant research professor at Georgetown University’s Center for Global Health Science and Security. ""In the end, that didn't happen.""  The worry in early 2018 was that the budget for the CDC’s global disease-prevention programs would be just over $50 million, as it had been in past years, when the supplement from 2014 was still the primary funding source. Trump’s 2018 budget proposal put it in that ballpark. But the budget Congress ultimately passed bumped the appropriations for ""global disease detection and other programs"" up to $108.2 million. The same amount was provided in 2019. In November 2018, the Department of Health and Human Services pledged an additional $150 million ""to support capacity strengthening in high-risk countries around the world"" at a meeting in which the U.S. affirmed its commitment to the next phase of the Global Health Security Agenda. The Trump administration’s 2021 budget request appropriated $225 million for the same global-health programs, up from $183.2 million in 2020. As we’ve reported, Trump has consistently proposed cuts to certain CDC budgets, but the bills Congress ultimately passed — with Trump’s signature — have steadily increased funding for the CDC’s infectious-disease activities. Experts said the administration’s wavering support has likely made it difficult for the CDC to plan out its activities. ""I don't think the 37 out of 47 statement is accurate,"" Standley said. ""But I do think that the Trump administration, in failing to provide consistent funding and clear indication of the priority placed on global health security capacity building, has made it difficult for the CDC to sustain the programs and successful efforts put into place since 2014."" ""Programs weren’t shut down in the end, but you can also say that the administration didn’t prioritize them in the proposed budget,"" added Jennifer Nuzzi, an associate professor of public health at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. It’s not clear why Behar referred to a shutdown of 37 of 47 programs when the 2018 news reports said the CDC was considering scaling back 39 of 49 operations.  It’s possible she pulled from a tweet by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., whose claim that Trump ""shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs"" was debunked by other fact-checkers. But however you crunch the numbers, it’s hard to get to 47 countries — or 49, for that matter.  Trump has put no one in charge of Coronavirus.He is pushing cuts to the budgets of all the agencies that fight pandemics. He shut down 37 of 47 global anti-pandemic programs. Trump made a choice to make us vulnerable...to this pandemic and the next one and the next one. A 2019 annual report on the Global Health Security Agenda says the CDC provides financial support and technical assistance to 17 priority countries, plus technical assistance for 14 countries and CARICOM, a group of 15 Caribbean countries and dependencies. One CARICOM country is Haiti, which is already listed among the countries receiving technical assistance from the CDC. Another is Montserrat, a British territory.  That adds up to 44 total countries, or 50 if you include six other countries that Standley said received some early support specifically related to the Ebola outbreak.  Behar said Obama ""set up anti-pandemic programs in 47 vulnerable countries as a way to protect against something like the coronavirus"" and ""Trump closed 37 of them."" News reports in 2018 said the CDC was planning to shrink its operations to help foreign countries prevent infectious diseases because it didn’t expect to receive new funding once the supplement it received in 2014 ran out. But the programs didn’t shut down in the end. The spending bill that lawmakers ultimately passed that year provided more money for those CDC programs than Trump’s budget request originally asked for.

Chris Christie's false claim that Democrats are going to raise taxes to 70 or 80 percent
","New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie may have gotten bumped to undercard debate, but that didn’t deter him from aiming above the GOP field and targeting the other side instead. Don’t worry about his fellow Republican rivals, Christie said, worry about the Democrats and Hillary Clinton, who is ""coming for your wallet."" ""If anybody believes the stuff they heard from that Democratic debate a few weeks ago, there’s nothing for free,"" Christie said. ""What they forgot to tell was that they’re going to raise your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent in order to provide all of that stuff."" Several of you asked us to look into whether Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O’Malley want to hike up taxes to 70 or 80 percent. The Christie camp told us that it’s been widely reported that Sanders ""doesn’t flinch"" over returning to a 90 percent top marginal tax rate. But that’s not the same thing as a tax increase of 70 or 80 percent for the average taxpayer (Christie earned a Pants on Fire for his statement last debate that Sanders wants a 90 percent rate for ordinary Americans). Nor does that prove that Clinton and O’Malley also want a tax rate, top marginal or otherwise, of 70, 80 or 90 percent. None of the three Democrats have released formal tax plans, but spokespeople for Clinton and Sanders said Christie’s statement is ""ridiculous"" and ""completely false."" Tax analysts also told us that there’s nothing in what Clinton, Sanders and O’Malley have said so far that suggest rates that high. The tax plans Here’s what each candidate has proposed so far, according to analysis by the free market-oriented Tax Foundation and the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, as well as our own research: Clinton’s tax plan Sanders’ tax plan O’Malley’s tax plan • Makes the higher education tax credit permanent and creates a credit for out-of-pocket health care costs   • Repeals the Cadillac tax in the Affordable Care Act   • Creates medium-term capital gains rates between 24 and 39.6 percent (current short-term rate is 39.6 percent and long-term rate is 20 percent) • Creates a 15 percent tax credit for companies that share profits with workers   • Creates a high-frequency trading tax   • Eliminates carried interest loopholes • Raises the top marginal income tax rate from 39.6 percent to above 50 percent   • Creates a net investment income surtax of 10 percent   • Raises capital gains and dividends tax rates to the level of income taxes   • Raises the top estate tax rate from 40 percent to 65 percent (estates under $3.5 million would be exempt)   • Repeals the Cadillac tax in the Affordable Care Act   • Raises the payroll tax of 12.4 percent to 12.8 percent • Eliminates deferral on foreign income   • Creates a $20 per ton carbon tax   • Creates a financial transaction tax   • Creates a Wall Street speculation tax • Eliminates the cap on Social Security taxes   • Repeals the Cadillac tax in the Affordable Care Act • Creates a financial transaction tax Compared to the Republicans’ tax plans, the Democrats’ proposals are less detailed and make minor changes to the current system, said the Tax Policy Center’s Roberton Williams. He and other experts emphasized that no Democrat has offered a detailed tax plan with specific rates, let alone rates as high as Christie says. ""It does not seem likely that the Democratic candidates intend to levy very high rates on the median American household,"" said Scott Greenberg, an analyst with the Tax Foundation. ""Christie’s claim is more of a statement of ‘there’s no such thing as free lunch,’ "" observed Bill Smith, the managing director of the tax consulting firm CBIZ MHM, adding, ""But I don’t think any of one of (the Democrats) in their wildest dreams would raise taxes to 70 or 80 percent across the board."" Not exactly ‘your tax rates’ Both Greenberg and the Williams pointed out that it’s plausible that the Democratic candidates would increase the rate on top earners. But that’s not the same thing as raising ""your tax rates to 70 or 80 percent.""   ""It may be necessary to raise top individual tax rates to levels such as 70 or 80 percent to fund Democratic candidates’ spending proposals without increasing the deficit or taxing middle- and low-income Americans,"" he said, referring us to a Wall Street Journal analysis of the price tag of Sanders’ proposals. As we’ve previously noted, Sanders has said he doesn’t think a top marginal tax rate of 90 percent would be too high. And he’s specifically proposed to raise the top rate from its current rate of 39.6 percent to above 50 percent. In other words, for individuals making more than $400,000 a year (roughly the threshold for the top 1 percent of incomes), any amount they make above $400,000 would be taxed at 50 percent. The income earned below $400,000 is taxed at lower rates. Sanders has also proposed to raise the top estate tax to 65 percent, which would affect estates worth more than $1 billion (there are 537 individuals with that much wealth in the United States today). Again, both of those top rates would affect just a tiny fraction of Americans. Sanders’ proposal to increase the federal payroll tax from 12.4 to 12.8 percent would hit everyone — but that’s nowhere near 70 or 80 percent. Clinton and O’Malley, for their parts, haven’t said anything specific about raising income or estate tax rates. But like Sanders, their proposals would mostly affect the wealthy and still not at the levels Christie is suggesting. Take for example, Clinton’s proposal to raise taxes on capital gains, the profits that come from selling an asset like a stock or property. In 2014, 42 percent of these investments, about $305 billion out of $722 billion, came from the top 0.1 percent, reported PolitiFact Virginia. Currently, the short-term rate is 39.6 percent (the same as income), but it decreases to 20 percent once you’ve held on to that stock for longer than a year. Clinton’s plans adds four additional brackets for investments held between one and six years. The highest rate proposed by Clinton, 39.6 percent, still doesn’t come close to Christie’s purported 70 or 80 percent. Our ruling Christie said the Democrats plan ""to raise your tax rates to 70 to 80 percent."" We understand the spirit of Christie’s statement, but that doesn’t make it accurate. None of the three Democrats running have proposed raising rates to 70 or 80 percent for the average taxpayer or is it likely that they will. Christie is exaggerating the rate hikes proposed by the Democrats, the amount of people they’ll affect or both.

Bernie Sanders says over half of black workers earn less than $15 an hour
","During an all-candidates’ Democratic forum in Rock Hill, S.C., on Nov. 6, 2015, host Rachel Maddow of MSNBC asked Bernie Sanders how he could win the support of African-American voters, a crucial Democratic voting group in the early primary state of South Carolina. Maddow noted that Sanders was polling at 8 percent in a recent poll in South Carolina and asked if he would be able to convince African-American voters that he could press for their issues. Sanders responded in part by citing his economic platform, which he said would positively impact African-Americans. ""I have the economic and social justice agenda now that, once we get the word out, will, in fact, resonate with the African-American community,"" Sanders said. ""We're talking about raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. … Over half of the black workers in this country earn less."" We wondered whether Sanders was right that ""over half of the black workers in this country earn less"" than $15 an hour. So we took a closer look. We turned to the most recent data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which, among other things, tracks the median weekly earnings of full-time wage and salary workers by race. The bureau’s data for the third quarter of 2015 shows that the median weekly earnings for African-American workers was $624. If you divide that by the standard 40 hours in a workweek, it works out to $15.60 per hour. That means that half of African-American workers earned less than $15.60. So Sanders was close on this but exaggerated slightly. His claim is off by a little more than 4 percent. When we asked Sanders’ campaign for their source, they pointed us to a report issued earlier this month from the National Employment Law Project that found that 54.1 percent of African-American workers earned less than $15.00 an hour. The group calculated that figure using data from 2012 through 2014. That’s a reasonable measurement, but while our figure covers a briefer period of time, it’s also more current, reflecting the continued economic growth since the end of 2014. Our ruling Sanders said that ""over half of the black workers in this country earn less"" than $15 an hour. Depending on the time frame used, the data shows that roughly half of black workers earn less than $15. The most recent data shows that half earn less than $15.60, which is a little higher than what Sanders said, but his number is not far off.

Electricity rates here are high, but not the highest
","Over the next four to five years, New England’s power grid is expected to lose thousands of megawatts of electricity as power plants, such as Brayton Point in Somerset, head into retirement. The planned shutdowns, including the closure of Plymouth’s Pilgrim Nuclear Generating Station, will heighten demand for electricity from other sources, including plants fueled by natural gas. And some say New Englanders could see higher electricity prices without an ample supply of natural gas. This is where Richard Paglia and his company, Houston-based Spectra Energy, come in. An upgrade to gas pipelines and gas storage capacity would expand supply and lower electricity prices, says Paglia. Some critics of Spectra’s various infrastructure projects, including two men who locked themselves to the front gates of the company’s Burrillville compressor station over the summer, oppose greater use of fossil fuels. ""Without that project going forward, we will really be constrained,"" Paglia said during an appearance on WPRI’s Executive Suite. ""We already pay the highest electricity prices in the country here in New England."" The costliest electricity in the country? We thought this was worth a check. Our research found that the average cost of electricity in New England is higher than other regions of the continental United States. But an emphasis on the words ""region"" and ""continental"" is important. In August 2015, the average price of electricity for New England’s six states was about 18.1 cents per kilowatt hour, according to a price monitoring report issued by the U.S. Energy Information Administration on Oct. 27. The average price for electricity in the state of California, 18.2 cents, slightly exceeded New England’s average. But California’s averages were lower during the winter of 2015. Also, in August, California’s region, which encompasses Oregon and Washington, had less expensive electricity than New England. Washington state’s average of 9.4 cents – the lowest in the country – helped hold the average price in its Pacific coast region to 15.7 cents. In comparison, the average for Rhode Island this past August was 18.7 cents. In the region that encompasses New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania, the average was 16.5 cents. In general, electricity was significantly less expensive elsewhere in the continental United States, away from the northeast and California coast. But in a region that the EIA refers to as ""Pacific Noncontiguous,"" which encompasses just Alaska and Hawaii, the average price of electricity was almost 27 cents. Hawaii’s average electricity price was about 30 cents while Alaska’s was 21 cents. A spokesman for Spectra, Creighton A. Welch, acknowledged that the New England region’s electricity prices are only highest in the continental United States. ""The main message here,"" said Welch, ""is that it’s a shame New England’s electric costs are so high relative to nearby regions – especially when practically next door sits a vast supply of affordable, domestic natural gas – that they are limiting economic competitiveness and growth in the region. It’s critical that we solve this energy challenge."" Our ruling New England had the priciest electricity in the continental United States according to a government report that compares New England to other regions of the country. The same report shows that California’s electricity was more expensive than electricity in four of six New England states. Meanwhile, Hawaii and Alaska are U.S. states and electricity within both of those states was more expensive than the New England region’s average. The average for the region that both states are grouped in was more expensive, too. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details. For this reason, we rate it Half True",/factchecks/2015/nov/12/richard-paglia/electricity-rates-here-are-high-not-highest/

Carly Fiorina says 'Obamacare isn't helping anyone'
","The Affordable Care Act -- Obamacare to some -- is a perennial target of Republicans. But at the GOP presidential debate in Milwaukee, Carly Fiorina made a particularly strong statement about the law’s ineffectiveness. ""Look, I'm a cancer survivor, okay?"" Fiorina told moderator Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network. ""I understand that you cannot have someone who's battled cancer just become known as a pre-existing condition. I understand that you cannot allow families to go bankrupt if they truly need help. But, I also understand that Obamacare isn't helping anyone."" Fiorina’s staff did not respond to an inquiry, but during the debate, she listed a number of problems she has with the law. ""It is crony capitalism at its worst,"" she said. ""Who helped write this bill? Drug companies, insurance companies, pharmaceutical companies. … Health insurance has always been a cozy, little game between regulators and health insurance companies."" Fiorina also said that ""Obamacare is crushing small businesses, it is not helping the families it was intended to help. So, let us allow states to manage high risk pools. Let us try the one thing in health insurance we've never tried, the free market. Let us ensure that as patients, and customers, that we have information to shop wisely for our health care."" Reasonable arguments can be made against the law and its many provisions. But is no one at all getting any actual help from the law? We decided to take a closer look. Here are some of the provisions of the law and estimates of how many people have benefited from each. The estimates are from Charles Gaba, who has spent several years crunching the numbers for usage of the law at the blog ACAsignups.net. Gaba’s estimates are current through November 2015 unless noted: • Americans currently enrolled in policies bought on the ACA’s online exchange: 9.5 million, of which roughly 8 million are receiving subsidies under the law. Another 2.5 million were enrolled in such policies during 2015 but have since dropped their coverage. • Net number of Americans added to Medicaid due to the law: 15 million. This includes 10 million added through direct expansion of Medicaid under the law, 4 million new but previously eligible beneficiaries who signed up for Medicaid after the ACA passed, and about 1 million transferred to Medicaid from existing, state-based programs. • Number of young adults age 19 to 26 who have been able to stay on their parents’ insurance due to the law: Possibly 1 million to 3 million, but the numbers change so often it’s hard to get a solid number. Of the 25 million-plus total from these three categories, Gaba estimates, roughly 17 million are newly insured specifically because of the law -- approximately 5 million through the exchanges, 11 million through Medicaid, and 1 million assorted others. Here are a couple of more ways people are benefitting: • Americans no longer at risk for coverage denial due to pre-existing conditions: As PolitiFact has previously reported, between 19 percent and 50 percent of Americans fall into this category, or between 60 million and 160 million people. • Americans no longer at risk of being kicked off policies for developing expensive medical conditions: Smaller than the previous categories, but unknown. There is some overlap between these categories. But whatever the number is, it’s in the tens of millions -- and most of those people, Gaba said, ""would disagree that it's ‘not helping anyone.’ "" Jonathan Oberlander, a professor in the Department of Health Policy and Management at the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, added two additional categories of Americans who have benefited from the ACA: • Medicare Part D beneficiaries, who are getting better prescription drug coverage: 39 million Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in the program. These and other Medicare beneficiaries are also getting such new benefits as free preventive screenings and an annual wellness checkup.   • Americans with private insurance who now have access to preventive services at no charge: Unknown, but likely in the millions. Another way to look at it holistically is to gauge the net impact on national uninsurance rates. They have fallen sharply since the law has been put into practice, as this chart from the Kaiser Family Foundation illustrates:  ""The statement is utter nonsense. Put simply, it is a wild exaggeration that amounts to a lie,"" Oberlander said. ""You can certainly debate the overall impact and desirability of Obamacare. But to say it isn’t helping anyone is to ignore both reality and overwhelming evidence to the contrary."" Policy experts who have mixed feelings about the law or oppose it outright say that some of these benefits have come at too high a cost, or have left more people significantly hurt than significantly helped. For instance, Gail Wilensky, who ran Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush and who has provided unofficial advice to Jeb Bush’s 2016 presidential campaign, said the law has squeezed out many of the more limited-benefit and catastrophic-coverage plans that beneficiaries may have liked, forcing them to pay for more expensive policies. ""This has been a problem for people above 300 percent of the poverty line who get small subsidies, and it’s been a real problem for people above 400 percent of the poverty line who get no subsidy,"" Wilensky said.   Michael Tanner, a scholar at the Cato Institute, said there have been both winners and losers, and that he expects that ""the losers far outnumber the winners."" That said, both Wilensky and Tanner agreed that Fiorina went too far in saying that ""Obamacare isn't helping anyone."" ""People on expanded Medicaid or who were previously uninsured and substantially subsidized in the exchange are better off than they were,"" Wilensky said, even if ""they may or may not be as well off as they could be."" Tanner added that, despite his qualms with the law, ""you can’t truthfully say that no one has benefited. Even if you believe that the previously uninsured are paying too much for crummy policies under the ACA, as I do, I don’t think you can say that none of them have benefited at all. That’s a pretty low bar, of course. If you flew across the country dumping money from an airplane, some people would benefit."" Our ruling Fiorina said that ""Obamacare isn't helping anyone."" Even taking the low end of estimates, tens of millions of Americans have benefited from the ACA, in big ways (such as securing insurance for the first time) or smaller ways (paying less for drugs under Medicare Part D). One does not have to buy into every aspect of the law or feel comfortable with its overall price tag to acknowledge that lots of people have benefited from it. We rate Fiorina’s statement Pants on Fire.  ",/factchecks/2015/nov/11/carly-fiorina/carly-fiorina-says-obamacare-isnt-helping-anyone/

Trump: Eisenhower deported 1.5 million immigrants
","Real estate mogul Donald Trump reiterated his proposal to deport the country’s illegal immigrants at the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Wis. History says his plan would work, Trump said. ""Let me just tell you that Dwight Eisenhower, good president, great president, people liked him. ‘I like Ike,’ right?"" Trump said in the Nov. 10 debate hosted by Fox Business Network. ""Moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country, moved them just beyond the border. They came back. Moved them again beyond the border, they came back. Didn’t like it. Moved them way south. They never came back."" Eisenhower did oversee a 1950s campaign that deported undocumented immigrants. But did he really move that many in one operation? The dragnet Beginning in World War II -- during a severe shortage of workers on the home front -- the federal government instituted the Bracero program, which brought Mexican workers into the United States to fill jobs that would not otherwise be filled. The Braceros were in the country legally, but the government often looked the other way when companies illegally brought their own Mexican workers into the country. In 1954, workers brought in outside the Bracero program, combined with Mexicans who had crossed the border illegally on their own, were the targets of a program called -- and this is really what it was called --  ""Operation Wetback."" The intention was to target illegal immigrants, though some U.S. citizens of Mexican ancestry were also caught up in the dragnet. Determining the number of people who were deported in ""Operation Wetback"" is tricky because some people who would have otherwise been subject to deportation were expected to leave the country ""voluntarily"" (or self-deportation). We came across estimates of forced removals ranging from 250,000 to 1.3 million. ""The (U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service) claimed as many as 1.3 million, though the number officially apprehended did not come anywhere near this total,"" according to the Texas State Historical Association’s online handbook, produced in partnership with the University of Texas at Austin.   The case of California is a good example. The INS (which was reorganized out of existence in 2003) said 540,000 people were to be deported from California alone during the campaign, said Don Mitchell, a geography professor at Syracuse University. But at least 485,000 would have had to deport themselves, and there’s no evidence that they actually returned to Mexico in those numbers. Kelly Lytle Hernandez, a history professor at the University of California Los Angeles, puts the maximum number of people actually deported during the operation at 250,000. The vast majority of the program took place during fiscal year 1955, which registered just about 254,000 apprehensions total, she wrote in a 2010 report. Re-entry What about Trump’s point that authorities deported people to more southern locations in Mexico to stop them from easily re-entering the United States? In earlier 20th century immigration control efforts, Border Patrol found that deporting immigrants at the U.S.-Mexico border allowed them to easily cross back into the United States, according to Hernandez’s paper. Starting in the 1940s, the United States would take deportees to the border, and from there Mexican authorities would take them to the country’s interior either by train or boat, primarily. This continued during Operation Wetback, so Trump has a bit of a point there. It’s worth noting that transportation conditions for the deportees bordered on inhumane in some cases. According to historian Mae M. Ngai, 88 people died in a July deportation round-up because of the heat. But attempts to relocate people to the Mexican interior did not always stop them from returning to the United States, Mitchell said. Many returned illegally or legally as guest workers. ""It is absolutely the case that sending folks to the interior did not stop them from returning,"" he said. ""It might be the case that some were discouraged, but others returned."" Further, the operation was more about policy changes that actually allowed more opportunities for immigrants to gain legal status through work visas than it was about deportation, Hernandez told PolitiFact. The campaign would have been ""a complete failure"" had it not been for the guest worker program that accompanied it, wrote Alex Nowrasteh, immigration policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. Nowrasteh noted that low levels of undocumented immigration in the 1950s was more likely a result of the guest worker program, rather than the 1954 deportation campaign. The guest worker program ended in 1965. ""On the whole, though, Trump’s comments are undoubtedly an exaggeration and a bit of a twist on the facts,"" Mitchell said. Our ruling Trump said President Eisenhower ""moved 1.5 million illegal immigrants out of this country."" Trump is referring to a 1954 campaign known as ""Operation Wetback."" While the idea that the operation resulted in more than 1 million deportations is not pulled out of thin air, historians widely cite that number as far too high for a variety of reasons -- including the fact that hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants would have had to self-deport. Also, it wasn’t just a deportation program. The campaign accompanied more legal immigration opportunities. We rate Trump’s claim Half True.

Ben Carson says Hillary Clinton gave conflicting accounts about Benghazi
","In Ben Carson’s playbook, a good defense is a good offense. Media reports have raised questions about Carson’s account of being violent as a child and whether he was offered a West Point scholarship. So the retired neurosurgeon got a question on his biography at the Nov. 10 debate. ""Are you worried your campaign -- which you've always said, sir, is bigger than you -- is now being hurt by you?"" asked Fox Business Network debate moderator Neil Cavuto. Carson switched the topic to call Hillary Clinton a liar for her comments as secretary of state about the attack in Benghazi. ""When I look at somebody like Hillary Clinton, who sits there and tells her daughter and a government official that no, this was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video. … Where I came from, they call that a lie."" We decided to fact-check Carson’s account of conflicting statements by Clinton and whether that shows she was lying. Carson has a point that Clinton privately told a few people the attacks were the work of terrorists. But he’s not accurate when he says she told ""everybody else"" that it was a video. Her public remarks were much more measured than Carson suggests. What Clinton said about Benghazi We’ve based our fact-checking of the Benghazi attacks on news accounts, government press releases and congressional investigations, as well as information we’ve received from the Carson and Clinton campaigns. As we have noted before, there was initial confusion about the cause of the attack at the time it happened. One key question was whether Ambassador to the United Nations Susan Rice purposefully downplayed the idea that it was a terrorist attack when she spoke on five Sunday talk shows days after the incident, instead suggesting that it a spontaneous reaction to a movie that mocked Islam. That movie had drawn protests around the Middle East at about the same time that the Benghazi attack happened.   Here are Clinton’s key comments: Sept. 11, 2012: The attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound begins at 3:40 p.m. ET (9:40 p.m. in Benghazi); an attack on a CIA mission annex begins at 6 p.m. ET. Four Americans die in the attacks. Sept. 11, 2012: During a phone call with Libyan President Mohamed Magariaf around 8 p.m. ET, Clinton said she understood Ansar al-Sharia, an al-Qaida-affiliated group, claimed responsibility for the attacks, according to notes from that conversation documented in a State Department email. However, Ansar al-Sharia soon retracted the claim. Clinton issued a public statement at 10:08 p.m. that didn’t indicate a cause for the attack but said, ""Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. ..."" At 11:12 p.m., Clinton sent an email to her daughter Chelsea saying: ""Two of our officers were killed in Benghazi by an al Queda-like (sic) group. The ambassador, whom I hand picked and a young communications officer on temporary duty w a wife and two young children. Very hard day and I fear more of the same."" Sept. 12, 2012: In a call with Egyptian Prime Minister Hesham Kandil, Clinton said, ""We know that the attack in Libya had nothing to do with the film. It was a planned attack — not a protest. Based on the information we saw today we believe the group that claimed responsibility for this was affiliated with al-Qaeda."" Sept. 13, 2012: In public remarks with Moroccan Foreign Minister Saad-Eddine Al-Othmani, she condemned the video, saying, ""I also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these protests in a number of countries.. ...."" Clinton did not say, though, that the video sparked the attack in Benghazi. Sept. 14, 2012: At a ceremony, Clinton said, ""This has been a difficult week for the State Department and for our country. We’ve seen the heavy assault on our post in Benghazi that took the lives of those brave men. We’ve seen rage and violence directed at American embassies over an awful Internet video that we had nothing to do with. The people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen, and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob."" So she mentions Benghazi in one sentence and then more broadly ""American embassies"" in the next sentence. Sept. 20, 2012: During a press conference Clinton talked about ""protests in several countries around the world"" and then said, ""And as I have said the video that sparked these protests is disgusting and reprehensible, and the United States government, of course, had absolutely nothing to do with it."" Clinton didn’t specify Benghazi in these comments. Sept. 21, 2012: Clinton talked at a press conference about protests in several cities in Pakistan and then said: ""We found the video that’s at the core of this series of events offensive, disgusting, reprehensible. But that does not provide justification for violence, and therefore it is important for responsible leaders, indeed responsible people everywhere, to stand up and speak out against violence and particularly against those who would exploit this difficult moment to advance their own extremist ideologies. Yesterday afternoon, when I briefed the Congress, I made it clear that keeping our people everywhere in the world safe is our top priority. What happened in Benghazi was a terrorist attack, and we will not rest until we have tracked down and brought to justice the terrorists who murdered four Americans."" It would be possible for a listener to conflate her comments about the video and Benghazi, but if you look closely at her statement she doesn’t do that. She blames the video on protests in Pakistan, but when she talks about Benghazi a couple of sentences later, she blames it on terrorism.   One more note: Charles Woods, father of Ty Woods who died in the attack, shared diary notes he took after meeting Clinton Sept. 14, 2012, for a Fox News report that aired on Oct. 23, 2015. Woods was in Washington for her testimony about Benghazi and had previously testified himself before a House committee in 2013. ""I gave Hillary a hug and shook her hand. And she said we are going to have the filmmaker arrested who was responsible for the death of my son,"" the entry said. Woods had previously recounted the same conversation to the media starting in 2012. Our ruling Carson said Clinton told her daughter and a government official that Benghazi ""was a terrorist attack, and then tells everybody else that it was a video."" But he’s oversimplifying multiple statements from Clinton during the month of the attacks. He has a point that Clinton told her daughter that terrorists attacked in Benghazi, and she told the Libyan president that a terrorist group had taken responsibility. But those were private comments made hours after the attack.   Carson misleads when he said that she told everybody else that it was a video. On the day after the attack, she told the Egyptian prime minister it had nothing to do with the film.  At other times, Clinton talked about the video but didn’t say it caused the attacks. At other times, she blamed the video more broadly for protests in various places. A family member of a victim said Clinton blamed the video for his son’s death, but we didn’t find that same sentiment expressed in any of her public comments. Carson is oversimplifying and distorting Clinton’s comments to portray a complex situation in the worst possible light. We rate his statement Mostly False.

In the video, Feuerstein bemoaned the absence of the word ""Christmas"" on the cups. ""Do you realize Starbucks wanted to take Christ and Christmas off of their brand new cups?"" he said. ""That’s why they’re just plain red. In fact, do you realize that Starbucks isn’t allowed to say Merry Christmas to customers?""

We asked Feuerstein and Starbucks for comment but did not hear back. If a picture as as good as a thousand words, we thought we’d let the pictures tell the story. We searched year by year, mainly on the photo sharing site Flickr, and were unable to find any previous cups that said Christ or Christmas. Here is what we found: 2013 cup  2012 cup  2011 cup  2010 cup  Then we skipped a few years. 2006 cup  2005 cup (the reusable version, we think)  2004 cup  We found no evidence that Starbucks ever put the word Christmas on its holiday cups. All the images we found included generic winter and holiday themes. Furthemore, the word Christmas is hardly banned at Starbucks. The caffeine purveyor’s 2015 annual blend drives home that point.  An investigative field trip to a Starbucks on L Street in Washington revealed that the coffee company also sells gift cards that say ""Merry Christmas"" (second row from top, right hand side).  Our ruling Feuerstein said Starbucks took ""Christ and Christmas"" off their cups. Feuerstein’s prank suggested he meant the word Christmas literally.

Marco Rubio said wrongly that welders make more money than philosophers
","Florida Senator Marco Rubio is a fan of vocational training. At the Fox Business Network GOP debate in Milwaukee, Rubio made a pitch for young Americans to put down the textbooks and pick up a blowtorch. ""For the life of me, I don’t know why we have stigmatized vocational training,"" Rubio said. ""Welders make more money than philosophers. We need more welders and less philosophers."" It was a big moment for Rubio, but was he correct? Philosophically and statistically speaking, no. It’s hard to know exactly how many philosophers there are in America, as many don’t have the title ""philosopher"" in their job descriptions. For this fact-check, we will look at those who majored in philosophy in college. According to Payscale, a company that collects salary information, philosophy majors make an average first-year salary of $42,200. The average mid-career pay for philosophy majors is even better: $85,000 per year. Additionally, the median pay for philosophy professors is nearly $90,000 per year, according to salary.com. The top 10 percent of philosophy professors make more than $190,000 a year. Rubio will be hard-pressed to find a welder who makes a comparable salary. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the median wage for welders, cutters, solderers and brazers is $37,420 -- about $18 an hour. The top 10 percent of welders earn $58,590 or more. That’s significantly less than the top 10 percent of philosophy professors, who earn $190,000 or more. We haven’t heard back from the Rubio campaign yet, but it’s possible that Rubio read something along the lines of this 2014 Wall Street Journal column, which cites a few cases in which welders bring home annual salaries exceeding $150,000. While this might be the case for some extremely high-level welders -- just as some philosophy professors make significantly more money than others -- the labor and salary data suggests these cases are the exception, not the norm. Our ruling Rubio said, ""Welders make more money than philosophers."" It made for a great sound bite, but neither salary nor labor statistics back up Rubio’s claim. Statistically, philosophy majors make more money than welders -- with much more room to significantly increase pay throughout their careers.

What we do know is only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian,"" Huckabee said. ""Are we  going to open the door so ISIS people can come on in, and we’ll give them a place to stay and a good sandwich and medical benefits?"" We were curious about Huckabee’s claim that the majority of the refugees don’t come from Syria. Huckabee’s spokesperson Hogan Gidley told us his source was the Eurostat, the European Union’s official statistical agency. He also forwarded us an article in the Daily Mail that said ""four out of five migrants are NOT from Syria."" (The article’s findings were repeated by some conservative American media outlets.) We found that the Daily Mail’s and Huckabee’s statistic represents the situation in the three months before the Syrian migrants actually began arriving in Europe in bulk. Looking at the whole picture, asylum seekers from Syria represent half of all refugees. According to the Daily Mail, the European Union ""logged 213,000 arrivals in April, May and June but only 44,000 of them were fleeing the Syrian civil war."" Those figures are lifted from Eurostat’s latest asylum quarterly report. But the Daily Mail’s use of data is flawed, and Huckabee’s extrapolation even more so. First, the four out of five non-Syrian migrants are not falsely claiming to be Syrian as Huckabee’s phrasing —  ""so-called Syrian refugees"" — suggests. There is anecdotal evidence of people using fake or stolen passports, but the refugees in Eurostat’s tally hail from other countries that are experiencing or recovering from conflict, like Afghanistan, Albania, Iraq and Kosovo. The Guardian explains why this distorts the refugee situation: ""If you lump this group in with those who crossed the Mediterranean to claim asylum, the number of Syrians will naturally seem smaller. But this is to conflate two largely separate phenomena: the Mediterranean crisis and internal migration between different European states."" (Huckabee’s point was that media reports conflated the the Syrian refugees and those who were not, Gidley told us.) And last and most importantly, the 44,000 figure only represents a three-month period. This is ""particularly problematic"" as the largest spike in Syrian arrivals occurred after June, pointed out the Guardian. Here’s a chart with data from the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees’ Syria page to that point:    If we look at all of 2015, Syrian refugees account for 52 percent of nearly 800,000 Mediterranean sea arrivals, according to the UN High Commissioner for Refugees. Afghanistan and Iraq were the next two top countries of origin of refugees, accounting for 19 percent and 6 percent of refugees respectively. Our ruling Huckabee said, ""Only one out of five of the so-called ‘Syrian refugees’ who went into Europe were actually Syrian."" While the claim isn’t pulled out of thin air, it’s flawed. The statistic represents the three months before the actual influx of Syrian refugees, and the four out of five non-Syrians are not purporting to be Syrian. Rather, they came from war-torn countries. Overall, Syrian refugees account for half of all refugees arriving in Europe in 2015 so far. We rate Huckabee’s claim Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2015/nov/11/mike-huckabee/huckabee-most-syrian-refugees-are-not-syrian-free-/

Ted Cruz says U.S. tax code has more words than the Bible
","During the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Ted Cruz compared two volumes -- one beloved by many, the other loathed by almost everybody. ""There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible -- and -- and not a one of them is as good,"" Cruz said. Our New Jersey affiliate checked a similar claim on length in 2013, so we’ll apply their research to Cruz’s claim here. How long is the tax code? A 2010 report by the Internal Revenue Service’s Taxpayer’s Advocate Office found that the tax code contained 3.8 million words. That calculation was made by downloading a zipped file of the code, unzipping it and running it through Microsoft Word’s word count feature, according to a footnote in the report. A 2012 version of the report puts the number of words in the code at ""about 4 million."" We also reached out to CCH, the Riverwoods, Ill.-based publisher of the two-volume 2013 Winter version of the tax code and was told the best estimate of word length was 4 million. That was two years ago, but we think it’s a safe bet that the length of the tax code has only increased since then, not decreased. How long is the Bible? Dennis Olson, the Charles T. Haley professor of Old Testament Theology at the Princeton Theological Seminary, told PolitiFact New Jersey that a fair approximation of the Bible’s length is 800,000 words for the Old and New testaments combined. ""The King James Version would be 823,156 while the more recent New Revised Standard Version would be 774,746 words,"" Olson said. Hellen Mardaga, an assistant professor of New Testament at Catholic University in Washington, agreed that estimates that put the Bible at 800,000 words were credible. Put it all together and the tax code is roughly five times as long as the Bible. So Cruz is correct. Our ruling Cruz said, ""There are more words in the IRS code than there are in the Bible."" It’s generally accepted that the tax code is about 4 million words long and that the Bible is about 800,000. That’s five times as long. So Cruz’s claim is True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/11/ted-cruz/ted-cruz-says-us-tax-code-has-more-words-bible/

At debate, Rand Paul says income inequality is worse in cities run by Democrats
","Where do you find income inequality? In cities run by Democrats, said Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. ""I think we ought to look where income inequality seems to be the worst,"" Paul said during the fourth Republican presidential debate, hosted by Fox Business Network Nov. 10. ""It seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats."" We fact-checked a similar claim Paul made last year and found it to be Half True. Let’s revisit what we uncovered. We used a 2014 study by the Brookings Institution that ranked the top 10 and bottom 10 cities by income inequality. Brookings updated the report in March 2015, and there were a couple changes to the rankings (based on 2013 data). We’ll go with the updated list. There appears to be something to what Paul said. Of the study’s 10 most unequal cities, nine have Democratic mayors. They are Atlanta, San Francisco, Boston, Washington, New York, Dallas, Chicago, Los Angeles, and Minneapolis. Only one, Miami, has a Republican mayor. By contrast, five of the 10 most equal cities have Republican mayors -- Albuquerque; Oklahoma City; Mesa, Ariz.; Colorado Springs, Colo.; and Virginia Beach, Va. The other five either have a nonpartisan mayor (Raleigh, N.C.; Las Vegas; and Arlington, Texas) or a Democrat (Columbus and Nashville). So on the numbers, Paul has a point. The question is, does this factoid mean anything? Experts we spoke to urged taking the claim with a grain of salt -- if not a whole shaker. Here are a few reasons why. Mayors aren’t all-powerful players in the local economy. Where claims of this sort are made, PolitiFact tries to establish whether credit or blame is deserved. In this case, then, is it reasonable to attribute patterns of inequality exclusively, or even primarily, to a mayor? No -- many factors play into a city’s economic success. The mayor of Detroit doesn’t have much power over the international market for automobiles, and no mayor of New York can take all the credit for the economic juggernaut of Wall Street. While mayoral policies may have an effect on the margins, such factors as the state and national business cycle, broad demographic patterns and international business trends tend to have a much greater impact on economic inequality in cities. In addition, it’s worth remembering that ""cities attract people on the basis of many factors, of which the party of their political leaders is probably a minor one,"" said William Frey, a senior fellow in Brookings’ Metropolitan Policy Program. Inequality patterns in cities may be at least as much about population size and geographic patterns as they are about partisan leadership. Focusing on the partisan differences obscures a more fundamental difference between the most and least unequal cities. The more unequal cities tend to be very big, and the less unequal cities tend to be more modestly sized. The median population of the 10 most unequal cities on the Brookings list is more than 700,000, compared to about 430,000 for the most equal cities. (If you use the mean instead, the average population of the 10 most unequal cities would be even higher -- 1.9 million versus 500,000.) So it’s not exactly apples-to-apples if you compare the attributes of New York, Los Angeles and Chicago on the one hand with those of Colorado Springs, Virginia Beach and Arlington on the other. All other things being equal, larger cities tend to have a wider distribution of incomes on both extremes, since they have more residents. That, almost by definition, means larger ratios between the top and the bottom. In the meantime, big cities tend to attract more wealthy people -- i.e., people who can choose to live anywhere they want -- because megacities are likelier to have world-class amenities. ""The real wealth ‘peaks’ tend to be in the big cities, so they have high tops as well as lower bottoms, while the income profiles of smaller localities are typically more ‘compressed,’ "" said Jamie Peck, a professor of geography at the University of British Columbia who has studied urban and political patterns in the United States. How old a city is can matter, too, said Jed Kolko, the chief economist and vice president of analytics at the real estate website Trulia. In older cities many middle-income residents have relocated to the suburbs, leaving behind higher levels of inequality. By contrast, newer cities -- such as Mesa (which is near Phoenix) or Arlington (which is near Dallas) -- often contain many suburban areas or are, in effect, suburbs themselves, Kolko said. Such cities tend to have more modest income ranges. Why does all this matter? It undercuts the notion that partisan leadership has much to do with why certain cities become relatively unequal and certain become relatively equal. Causation may actually run the opposite way. It’s always important to remember that correlation does not necessarily mean causation. In this context, it’s not necessarily that Republican leadership creates greater equality, as Paul’s comment presumes. Rather, it could be that greater equality prompts people to vote Republican. Or it could be unrelated. ""I think it runs more in the direction that inequality provides conditions for Democratic success, rather than Democrats causing inequality,"" said Michael McDonald, a University of Florida political scientist who specializes in electoral patterns and geography. And any explanation other than political leadership causing greater equality weakens Paul’s point. The pattern holds only if you look at cities, not metropolitan areas. If you look at Kolko’s research -- which studied inequality in broader metropolitan areas, rather than in cities per se -- Paul’s pattern falls apart. As of 2014, of the 10 metropolitan areas with the most equality, only one has a Republican mayor -- Colorado Springs. The other nine either have a Democratic mayor, a nonpartisan one, or no mayor at all because they’re an unincorporated area. This list includes Lakeland-Winter Haven, Fla.; Allentown, Pa.; Salt Lake City; Bethesda-Rockville-Frederick, Md., Tacoma, Wash.; Las Vegas; Cape Coral-Fort Myers, Fla.; Raleigh; and Palm Bay-Melbourne-Titusville, Fla. What Paul’s office says Brian Darling, a former spokesman for Paul, told PolitiFact last year that the senator was not simply casting aspersions on Democratic mayors’ handling of their cities’ economies. ""What he was saying is that Democrats are not solving the problem,"" Darling said. ""It may be an unsolvable problem. Democrats love to talk about the issue and have been allowed to position themselves as the warriors for those harmed by income inequality, yet they are not a party of action"" on this issue. That’s a reasonable point, but we think a typical listener hearing Paul’s comment would have assumed that he was arguing that Republican policies have promoted greater equality in cities than Democratic policies have. And as we’ve found, that’s far from clearcut. Our ruling Paul said that income inequality ""seems to be worst in cities run by Democrats."" He has a point that one credible study shows a fairly strong correlation between low inequality and a Republican mayor. But experts say it’s a stretch to draw conclusions from this. The claim inflates the actual powers of mayors to shape inequality in their cities and it ignores the role of population size and suburbanization in driving inequality. It also glosses over the fact that metropolitan areas, as opposed to cities, show no such relationship. The claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details, so we rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2015/nov/11/rand-paul/debate-rand-paul-says-income-inequality-worse-citi/

Ben Carson said raising the minimum wage will increase joblessness
","At the Fox Business Network debate, it didn’t take long for the topic of the minimum wage to come up. During a back-and-forth with the moderators, Republican presidential candidate Ben Carson urged caution on raising the minimum wage, saying, ""People need to be educated on the minimum wage. Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases."" We checked a similar claim by Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md. In November 2014, Cardin made the opposite case, claiming that ""every time we've increased the minimum wage, we've seen a growth in jobs."" We rated Cardin’s claim Mostly False, after determining that during the 12 months following each of the 11 minimum wage increases since 1978, about half produced a net gain in jobs and about half produced a net loss of jobs. In this case, we decided we couldn’t rely on the exact same data, since Cardin referred to a growth in jobs, while Carson referred to an increase in joblessness. Those aren’t exactly the same things, though the Bureau of Labor Statistics calculates both metrics. So we used the same methodology to look at the 12-month changes in unemployment level after those 11 minimum-wage hikes. The chart below shows what we found: Year of minimum wage increase New minimum wage Change in number of people unemployed over next 12 months Was a recession going on during the 12-month period? 1978 $2.65 Down 380,000 No 1979 $2.90 Up 574,000 Yes 1980 $3.10 Up 1,388,000 Yes 1981 $3.35 Up 1,326,000 Yes 1990 $3.80 Up 1,642,000 Yes 1991 $4.25 Up 976,000 No 1996 $4.75 Down 577,000 No 1997 $5.15 Down 356,000 No 2007 $5.85 Up 1,788,000 Yes 2008 $6.55 Up 5,664,000 Yes 2009 $7.25 Down 89,000 No The headline here is that joblessness rose after a minimum-wage hike more than half the time -- seven out of 11 occasions -- but fell four times. Since joblessness fell some of the time, it means that Carson’s sweeping claim -- that joblessness rises ""every time"" the minimum wage goes up is off-base. But there’s another factor that casts additional doubt on his assertion. As it happened, there was a recession under way during six of the 11 periods we studied. During each of those periods, joblessness rose after the minimum wage went up. This is not surprising -- but it does cast into doubt the cause and effect behind the rise in joblessness. The impact of a recession does, at the very least, raise questions about whether a minimum wage hike in and of itself caused joblessness. If you look instead at the five wage hikes that occurred when a recovery was under way, joblessness declined four of those times. The only exception was the 1991 wage hike, which took effect soon after a recovery began. Finally, we should note that economists are split over what effect a minimum wage hike has on job growth. There’s some research that shows raising the minimum wage negatively impacts job growth, and a lot that shows it has an insignificant effect. Our ruling Carson said, ""Every time we raise the minimum wage, the number of jobless people increases."" If you look at the 12-month period following every minimum-wage hike since 1978, joblessness did rise on seven occasions, but it fell on four occasions, undercutting his sweeping claim. In addition, it’s not at all clear that a minimum-wage hike was the primary culprit for the periods in which joblessness rose, since those periods also coincided with broader recessions in the economy. We rate his claim False. ",/factchecks/2015/nov/11/ben-carson/ben-carson-said-raising-minimum-wage-will-increase/

For comparison, a $343 billion trade gap is roughly the entire Gross Domestic Product of Denmark. So far, the trade deficit for 2015 has been calculated through September 2015, totalling almost $274 billion. Over the last 12 months of available data, the trade deficit has totaled $364 billion.

Bobby Jindal says he's the only one who's cut spending, offers Christie a juice box
","Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal went on the attack during the Nov. 10, 2015, Fox Business debate, at one point offering New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie a theoretical blue ribbon and a juice box for talking the conservative talk. But Jindal said only he has been doing the conservative walking. ""Here’s the dirty little secret,"" Jindal said. ""You’re gonna hear a lot of Republicans tonight in this debate and the next one talk about cutting government spending. It’s gonna sound great. There’s only one of us who’s actually cut government spending -- not two, there’s one and you’re looking at him."" Jindal has previously boasted that he’s the only one to cut government spending. Is it true? The answer: it depends on the analysis. Jindal’s evidence Jindal also makes the claim that he’s ""the only candidate to actually cut spending"" on his website, citing a report by libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. (When we last looked into this claim in August, a spokesperson for Jindal confirmed that this is what he was referring to.) According to Cato, Jindal is indeed the only governor out of the six running to have cut spending (Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and former Texas Gov. Rick Perry dropped out after the Cato report was published). During his seven-year tenure as Louisiana's chief, Jindal reduced spending by an average of 1.76 percent every year. Every other governor increased spending, Cato said. Here’s a graph from Jindal’s campaign, which is based off of Cato’s analysis:  ""Bobby Jindal shows the most fiscal restraint,"" the Cato report concludes. Much of the reduction, reported the Times-Picayune in 2011, is ""explained by waning hurricane recovery appropriations and the end of federal stimulus aid."" However, the Cato report is just one way, and something of a simplistic way, to look at the state budget picture. It fails to consider the different per-capita income levels across different states (higher incomes bring more government services and thus spending), different approaches to handling federal money (Ohio Gov. John Kasich, for example, took the Medicaid expansion while Jindal did not), and different time periods, lists Alan Auerbach, a professor of public finance at the University of California at Berkeley. Unlike Jindal and other sitting governors, Jeb Bush, Mike Huckabee and George Pataki weren’t leading their states through economic downturns. Auerbach explains: ""During recessions, balanced-budget requirements have typically forced states to cut spending, in addition to legislating tax increases."" Kasich himself takes issue with Cato’s analysis, arguing that Cato focused on a specific pool of money known as the general revenue fund. Kasich prefers instead to look at the all-funds budget, a much larger pot of federal and state money. (Cato’s response: ""Our data is correct, and so is his. Kasich seems to pick the dataset that shed the best light on him."") Chris Edwards, Cato’s director of tax policy, argued that the general fund data is more recent and perhaps more relevant than the all-funds. ""Governors have more direct control over the general fund budget,"" he said. ""A lot of the non-general fund budget comes from the federal government, which governors don’t have much control over."" Another way to run the numbers Others have looked at this question and come up with different results. If we look at all-funds and adjust for the time differences, four governors actually out-cut Jindal, according to a fact-check by Fox News, which compared each governor’s budgets to their contemporaries (in other words, how Bush stacked up against other governors in the 2000s, and how Jindal is doing compared to sitting governors). The two top spenders by Cato’s count, Bush and Kasich, actually ranked best in Fox News’ analysis. Bush and Kasich slashed spending by 3.66 percent and 1.76 percent respectively. Jindal, meanwhile, came in at No. 5 on the Fox News analysis, with an average reduction of 0.25 percent per year. Here’s Fox’s breakdown: This is still an imperfect way of comparing the budget records of the various governors, but to an extent, it’s fairer, Auerbach said. ""Controlling for what other states did at the same time certainly is better than not controlling for time period,"" he said. ""One might do better still by controlling for relative economic conditions in the different states but … the controls are reasonable."" Our ruling Jindal said, ""There’s only one of us who’s actually cut government spending -- not two, there’s one and you’re looking at him."" To his credit, a Cato report backs his claim. However, there’s more than one way of looking at spending cuts. One other approach that an expert said is valid suggests that Jindal was out-cut by four other governors.

Christie: The U.S. is in the worst recovery since WWII
","The central theme of the Republican presidential debate in Milwaukee, Wis., was business and economics. Fox Business moderator Sandra Smith laid out a bleak employment picture for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. She said there are 90 million Americans unemployed or not in the workforce at all. For those that are working, Smith said wages aren’t budging. Christie responded with an anecdote of a woman he met in New Hampshire who told him how she worried each month that she wouldn’t have enough to pay her bills. ""There are tens of millions of Americans living that way after the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II,"" Christie said. Is the United States in the middle of ""the worst recovery from an economic recession since World War II""? Conveniently, the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis website has a tool that allows you to compare recessions back to 1948. Here’s what the Fed’s site tells us. This recovery is not the worst when it comes to jobs. The Federal Reserve measures the cumulative percentage gain in employment from the point when each recession ended and the recovery began. During the recovery from the 2001 recession, employment didn’t crawl out of negative territory for about 28 months. By comparison, in the recovery following the 2007 recession, at the 21-month mark, the United States began adding jobs beyond the number that existed at the start of the recovery. The following chart measures the jobs picture following every recession since World War II. The red line is the current recovery:  Seventy-six months from the start of the recovery, the economy today has produced a cumulative jobs gain of 8.9 percent. After 76 months in the recovery from the 2001 recession, the cumulative gain was 5.4 percent. There is another way to measure job trends. You can look at gains compared to the pre-recession employment peak. By that yardstick, it took 76 months to match the number of jobs in the economy before the 2007 downturn, which was the worst since World War II. It took 46 months for the recovery after the 2001 recession to reach the same point. But the job losses in 2001 were much smaller, so that recovery had less ground to regain. Economic output But Christie does have a point if you look at economic output,  as measured by the Gross Domestic Product, or GDP. Looking at GDP growth, the current recovery is indeed the slowest since the Depression. Again here’s the chart:  For a few quarters, the current recovery did better than the one that followed the 1980 recession, but while the current recession generally has showed slow gains, the 1980 recovery took off. The cumulative increase in real Gross Domestic Product for the present recovery is 14.2 percent. That is worse than the 17.2 percent for the 2001 recovery. Tara Sinclair is chief economist at Indeed and economics professor at George Washington University. ""We've just passed 61 months of consistent employment growth, and longer if you just look at private employment,"" Sinclair told PolitiFact. ""On that metric, the recovery is the longest since WWII, so that hardly seems the worst. On the other hand, the recovery has been notably slow, and we are not back to the trend level of GDP or employment that we would have expected without the recession."" Sinclair added that even in terms of GDP it’s hard to call this the worst recovery because the country is emerging from what economists count as the deepest recession since World War II. Our ruling Christie said the United States is in the worst economic recovery from a recession since World War II. Christie’s campaign did not respond to our request for comment. The truth is it depends on what you measure. Looking at GDP growth, he’s right. Looking at the employment picture, the 2001 recovery was worse. Christie’s claim is partially accurate.

Did the Obamacare insurance co-ops fail faster than average? We run the numbers
","It’s sign-up time for Obamacare and while the website is clicking along and the program has succeeded in reducing the ranks of the uninsured, there is one notable sore spot: A $2.4 billion effort to provide low-cost insurance through consumer owned insurance cooperatives is in deep trouble. Out of the 23 co-ops largely funded through Obamacare by federal loans, 12 will no longer offer policies after this year. Republican critics of the president’s signature health care law have focused on these failures. But a staunch defender of the Affordable Care Act, Zeke Emanuel, brother of President Barack Obama’s former chief of staff and bioethicist at the University of Pennsylvania, downplayed the bad news on MSNBC. ""When you start businesses in America, at the fifth year, half of the businesses have closed,"" Emanuel said on Nov. 3, 2015. ""The idea that some of these co-ops are going to work and some aren’t should be expected. That's what business is about. The idea that 100 percent will succeed is a false metric we don't hold the private sector to."" We decided to dig into Emanuel’s notion that a 50-percent failure rate after five years for businesses applies to these insurance co-ops. Where the co-ops came from When Congress passed the Affordable Care Act, it included $6 billion in loans to launch Consumer Owned and Oriented Plans. The vision was to create nonprofit health insurance companies that would provide low-cost, high quality policies to individuals and small businesses. Without the need to produce a return on investment, these enterprises would, in theory, be able to compete against the major generally for-profit players in the market. In fact, in places where competition was scant, these co-ops would help the market deliver better value for all consumers. Throughout 2012 and 2013, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department approved loans to get the co-ops up and running. After a series of budget cuts, program funding was capped at $2.4 billion. In 2013, the co-ops began selling policies to provide coverage in 2014. The dates are important because it’s doubtful any of these co-ops were five years old as of 2015. If they weren’t five years old, then Emanuel’s benchmark might not be as suitable as he suggested. Emanuel told us that the co-ops launched before 2012. ""Many of these co-ops were started in 2011 and were doing a lot of work to get ready,"" Emanuel told PunditFact. ""To apply for a loan, you had to do some serious analysis about the market and costs. You needed to have a business plan."" On the other hand, Emanuel said there isn’t any perfect comparison data to work with. His real point he said was ""to give some context for the closures,"" and ""to focus on when they began is to miss the forest for the trees."" ""Their age? They were somewhere north of three years old,"" he told us. Scott Harrington is a business professor who focuses on health care finance at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School.  ""Some of the co-ops didn’t even last two years,"" Harrington said. We looked at the data to help resolve this. Failures accumulate For several decades, the U.S. Census Bureau has tracked the births and deaths of firms in the Business Dynamics Statistics database. We crunched the numbers in two ways -- for all firms and for firms in the finance, insurance and real estate business. That industry group -- known by the acronym FIRE -- is broader than you would want but it’s the closest match to see how the insurance co-ops stack up against approximately similar kinds of firms. The bottom line is that after five years, about 44 percent of all businesses have disappeared. So Emanuel was pretty close when he said about half have closed. But as you might expect, the younger the companies, the lower the failure rate. Here are the average rates from 2000 to 2007, based on Census business data. (We didn’t include 2008 or 2009 because closings spiked during the Great Recession.) Average firm failure rate 2000-2007 After 1 year After 2 years After 3 years After 4 years After 5 years All firms 17% 27% 34% 40% 44% FIRE industry 16% 26% 34% 40% 45%   So Emanuel’s comparison ultimately boils down to how old the co-ops were. There is no perfect answer. Emanuel said they existed when they began doing the research to apply for a federal loan. You could say they were born on the day Washington approved their loans. We used the Census Bureau definition. The Census Bureau said it treats the first year a company shows employment in its payroll tax records as the year it was born. We looked at CoOportunity Health in Iowa. It was in the first wave of loan recipients on Feb. 17, 2012. The company’s former Chief Financial Officer Stephen Ringless told us the loan award took the co-op to the next step of securing a state insurance license. When that came through, it hired a few consultants. ""When the company was able to develop a payroll system in early June 2012, those consultants became full-time employees,"" Ringless said. Almost exactly two-and-half years later, on Jan. 29, 2015, the Iowa insurance commissioner moved to liquidate CoOportunity Health. The firm was about $50 million in the red. While some employees were retained as the firm was wound down, as a going concern, its days ended in early 2015. We did not dig into the details of all of the failed co-ops but the CoOportunity timeline seems more or less to apply to many of them. A June 2013 Inspector General’s Office report looked at the 18 co-ops funded in the first half of 2012. The federal auditors said that by the end of 2012, all of the firms were still ""hiring staff, obtaining licensure, and building necessary infrastructure."" By the third quarter of 2015, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services reported that 12 co-ops would no longer be in business as of 2016. Given all this, it would be reasonable to say the co-ops were three years old when they failed. That would run from mid-way through 2012 -- approximately the time of funding -- until mid-way through 2015 -- approximately the time the closure process was underway. The failure rate was over 50 percent. The corresponding failure rate at the three-year mark for all American businesses and for the broader finance, insurance and real estate sector is 34 percent. The co-ops fared significantly worse than the U.S. average, failing at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than is typical. Harrington at the University of Pennsylvania noted one other significant difference between the co-ops and the typical American start-up. ""How many firms launch with heavy subsidies from the government?"" he asked. Our ruling Emanuel said the Obamacare insurance co-ops failed at a rate that’s typical for American businesses over a five-year period. The underlying comparison is flawed. While the age of each co-op is subject to debate, we used the Census Bureau’s definition to determine when they were born. Interviews with experts, government audits, and regulators’ actions point to three years as the typical lifespan of a failed co-op. About 50 percent of the co-ops shut down. Compared to the three-year failure rate in America, the co-ops have done much worse -- cratering at a rate that is about 40 percent faster than average. But Emanuel could turn out to be right. We won’t know the five-year rate for the entire group until late in 2016 or early 2017. If the remaining co-ops are still running, then the group’s failure rate will be close to the national average. Emanuel’s statement is accurate regarding the five-year-average but leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.  ",/factchecks/2015/nov/10/ezekiel-emanuel/did-obamacare-insurance-co-ops-fail-faster-average/

Fact-checking Martin O'Malley's claim that Bernie Sanders sought primary challenger to Obama
","Bernie Sanders didn’t have Barack Obama’s back in 2012, Maryland Gov. Martin O’Malley suggested at the First in the South Democratic Presidential forum. ""When President Obama was running for re-election, I was glad to step up and work very hard for him, while Sen. Sanders was trying to find someone to primary him,"" O’Malley said on Nov. 6, adding that he’s ""a lifelong Democrat"" unlike Sanders, a former independent, and Hillary Clinton, a former Republican. That’s ""categorically false,"" Sanders said on ABC’s This Week two days later: ""Somebody asked me years ago, do you think there should be a primary opponent to Barack Obama? And I don't know exactly the words that I -- I'm not sure -- what's wrong with a primary situation?"" So who’s right? The Sanders campaign didn’t get back to us, but O’Malley’s spokesperson sent us several examples of Sanders saying a primary challenge wouldn’t be a bad idea. We also searched Google, Nexis and CQ for comments Sanders made on the topic of a primary challenge. Here’s what he said: • March 16, 2011 WNYC: ""If a progressive Democrat wants to run, I think it would enliven the debate, raise some issues, and people have a right to do that. I've been asked whether I am going to do that. I'm not. I don't know who is, but in a democracy, it's not a bad idea to have different voices out there."" • July 22, 2011 Thom Hartmann Radio Program: ""I think one of the reasons that the president has been able to move so far to the right is that there is no primary opposition to him, and I think it would do this country a good deal of service if people started thinking about candidates out there to begin contrasting what is a progressive agenda as opposed to what Obama is doing. … At this point, I have not (encouraged anyone), but I am now giving thought to it. There are a lot of smart, honest, progressive people who I think can be good presidents."" • Aug. 12, 2011 C-SPAN: ""If you’re asking me, do I think at the end of the day that Barack Obama is going to be the Democratic nominee for president in 2012? I do. But do I believe that it is a good idea for our democracy, and for the Democratic Party — and I speak, by the way, as an independent — that people start asking the president some hard questions about why he said one thing during his previous campaign and then is doing another thing today on Social Security, on Medicare? I think it is important that that discussion take place."" • Nov. 13, 2011 Politico: Sanders refused to say whether he would back the president in 2012, but said he hopes ""the president never forgets who elected him to the White House. It was not Wall Street, although they contributed. It was not the big money interests. It was working families, lower-income people and the middle class."" He also urged Obama to ""stop reaching negotiated agreements with Republicans that are extremely weak and disadvantageous to ordinary people. ... I certainly hope and expect to be supporting the president, but it’s a little bit early in the process."" So it’s clear that Sanders was suggesting a primary challenge to move Obama to the left, experts said, but not exactly the way O’Malley phrased it. ""I'm not sure if he was actually actively ‘trying to find someone,’ but it is clear that he thought it would be a good idea if someone did decide to challenge him,"" said Jennifer Mercieca, a historian of American political discourse at Texas A&M University. (Sanders’ comments sparked a rumbling in the media as well as the question of whether that someone would be Hillary Clinton.) Kathleen Kendall, a communications professor at the University of Maryland who specializes in presidential campaign rhetoric, noted that Sanders was expressing strong dissatisfaction with Obama’s policies -- a point that didn’t go unnoticed by the White House. Four anonymous senior officials for Obama’s 2012 campaign told BuzzFeed that Sanders was ""either attacking the president from the left or doing little to get him elected."" ""Every indication we had was that he was considering a primary challenge,"" one unnamed official said in the BuzzFeed story. Sanders eventually endorsed Obama over Mitt Romney, telling CNN in May 2012, ""I think Obama is by far the preferable candidate. Is Obama doing everything I want? Absolutely not, and among other things, he has not been as strong as he should standing up to Wall Street."" Our ruling O’Malley said, ""When President Obama was running for re-election … Sen. Sanders was trying to find someone to primary him."" As a sitting senator, Sanders' comments at a minimum were provocative: He didn't think it was a bad idea for a candidate to run against Obama in the primary. He spoke positively of such a scenario several times. When Sanders endorsed Obama, Sanders said it was because Obama was preferable to Romney. That doesn’t mean Sanders was actively searching for a candidate to actually run against Obama.
