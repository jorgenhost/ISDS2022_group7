Rep. Elijah Cummings says new financial protection bureau will have budget equal to just 1 percent of industry's fees
","
During a contentious hearing on May 24, 2011, members of a congressional oversight subcommittee sparred with Elizabeth Warren, who is President Barack Obama’s pick to head a new federal agency charged with protecting consumers from abusive practices in the financial services sector.

The hearing attracted media attention for a testy exchange between the subcommittee’s chairman, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C., and Warren, who has become a champion of those who want to see stricter oversight of Wall Street. Her official appointment as director has been blocked by Republicans, who want to see changes in how the new agency operates, though she has been working to get the agency up and running as assistant to the president and special adviser to the Treasury Secretary.

A reader pointed us to one statistic presented at the hearing that purported to show the imbalance between federal regulators and Wall Street.

Rep. Elijah Cummings of Maryland, the top Democrat on the full oversight panel, said that the new agency’s ""budget is only about 1 percent of the amount banks generate just from late fees and overdraft fees. … I have to ask you: How in the world will you be able to compete against this Goliath when you are so mismatched?""

We wondered whether there was such an imbalance.

We were able to track down sources for both types of fees.

R.K. Hammer, a privately held bankcard consulting firm, tracks credit card penalty fees. The firm found that card penalty fees assessed by the industry during 2010 totaled $22.5 billion.

We should note that the figure we’re using from R.K. Hammer -- what the firm calls ""penalty fees"" -- is an umbrella category that includes various types of fees. However, the firm says that late fees -- the category specifically cited by Cummings -- account for more than 90 percent of penalty fees. So we’ll reduce the amount slightly, to an estimated $20.3 billion in late fees.

Meanwhile, the economic research firm Moebs Services tracks data on overdraft fees. The firm projected that for 2010, overdraft fees will total $35.4 billion.

If you add these two figures, the total is $55.7 billion. To make sure we weren’t double-counting, we checked with both firms, and they confirmed that the two estimates do not overlap.

What about the agency’s budget? We turned to the agency’s website for the answer.

Budget documents posted there say that the agency’s estimated budget for fiscal year 2011 is $142.8 million, a number that Obama wants to increase to $329 million in fiscal year 2012.

Using the 2011 figure, the agency’s budget is three-tenths of 1 percent of the industry fee totals. Using the larger figure for 2012 -- which is only a proposal -- it works out to six-tenths of 1 percent.

Both figures are well under the 1 percent threshold Cummings cited. And the fees in Cummings’ comparison are just a small slice of the resources available to financial institutions. According to the Department of Commerce, profits in the finance and insurance sector for 2010 -- not revenues, just profits -- amounted to $366.8 billion.

We’ll note here that we're not ruling on whether a budget that’s equal to 1 percent of penalty and overdraft fees is too little (or too much) to carry out the agency’s tasks. But on the specific comparison Cummings made, we found that he was accurate and even understated the disparity slightly. He’s correct that the new agency’s budget is ""only about 1 percent of the amount banks generate just from late fees and overdraft fees."" So we rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA9FE00>],/factchecks/2011/jun/08/elijah-cummings/rep-elijah-cummings-says-new-financial-protection-/

California attack ad links Craig Huey to Sarah Palin, says both would ban a woman's right to choose
","
A new campaign video from California congressional candidate Janice Hahn, a Democratic Los Angeles city councilwoman, is remarkable not so much for its attacks on her opponent Republican Craig Huey -- it's fairly standard abortion and the-Republicans-want-to-end-Medicare fare -- but rather for its efforts to tie Huey's positions to that of former Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin.

""Sarah Palin and Craig Huey. Which would ban a woman's right to choose in every case? Both Palin and Huey,"" the narrator begins.

""Which supports a radical plan to end Medicare, but wants to give tax breaks to the wealthy? Palin and Huey again.""

""But which one called Planned Parenthood a 'murder mill'? Only Craig Huey. We don't need Craig Huey's extremist right wing agenda.""

The Palin cameo is an intriguing political strategy, one that appears to bank on Palin's negative baggage.

""They clearly see Palin as a polarizing figure,"" said Nathan Gonzales, political editor of the independent Rothenberg Political Report in Washington, D.C. ""And so the more closely they can tie Huey to Palin the better."" The ad appears to be aimed at sparking larger voter turnout in the heavily Democratic Los Angeles district, he said.

Huey, a business consultant and political commentator, and Hahn are facing off in a July 12 special election to replace former Democratic Rep. Jane Harman, who retired in February.

We’re fact-checking two claims in this ad. In a separate item, we looked at whether Huey called Planned Parenthood a ""murder mill."" Huey claims a campaign staffer actually wrote that phrase on his political blog, but since it’s his website, he’s standing by it. We rated the claim True.

In this item, we will focus on whether both Palin and Huey ""would ban a woman's right to choose in every case.""

Is it true that both Palin and Huey ""would ban a woman's right to choose in every case?""

Let's start with Palin's position on abortion, which was well-established during the 2008 elections. The Hahn campaign pointed us to a Dec. 4, 2009, article in POLITICO describing Palin as an ""anti-abortion star.""

Palin spelled out the nuances of her position clearly in an ABC News interview with Charles Gibson on Sept. 13, 2008:

Gibson: Roe v. Wade, do you think it should be reversed?

Palin: I think it should and I think that states should be able to decide that issue... I am pro-life. I do respect other people's opinion on this, also, and I think that a culture of life is best for America... What I want to do, when elected vice president, with John McCain, hopefully, be able to reach out and work with those who are on the other side of this issue, because I know that we can all agree on the need for and the desire for fewer abortions in America and greater support for adoption, for other alternatives that women can and should be empowered to embrace, to allow that culture of life. That's my personal opinion on this, Charlie.

Gibson: John McCain would allow abortion in cases of rape and incest. Do you believe in it only in the case where the life of the mother is in danger?

Palin: That is my personal opinion.

Gibson: Would you change and accept it in rape and incest?

Palin: My personal opinion is that abortion (should be) allowed if the life of the mother is endangered.

So Palin's lone exception to her hard-line stance on abortion is when the life of the mother is in peril.

Huey takes a similarly conservative view of abortion. ""His personal opinion on abortion is that he opposes it,"" said Dave Gilliard, a consultant to the Huey campaign. Huey was adopted, he said, so this is ""a very personal issue for him.""

However, Gilliard said, Huey ""understands that the Supreme Court has ruled on this issue and that Congress cannot change that and cannot ban abortions.""

So it's wrong, he said, for the ad to claim that Huey would ban abortions.

""He has said specifically many times that he understands the Supreme Court has made its decision,"" Gilliard said. ""He thinks it's a bad decision and wishes they would change their mind. But Congress cannot ban abortions.""

As backup for ad's claim, Hahn's campaign manager Dave Jacobson pointed to several blog postings on electionforum.org, a website that Huey manages as an outlet for his political beliefs.

In one of them, on Jan. 28, 2011, Huey sent out a note of thanks to those who attended a March for Life rally in Washington D.C. 
""During this time of reform in Washington, we cannot ignore the unborn or forget about the immoral, twisted Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision,"" he wrote. 
Other posts to the website (hereand here) make clear Huey’s hard line on abortion.
 
We think there's a bit of hair-splitting in the debate over the ad's claim. Huey’s position on abortion appears to be very similar to Palin’s. Whether they ""would ban"" a woman’s right to choose, depends a bit on how you interpret the phrase ""would"" and whether they make any exceptions. It's true that Congress does not have the power to overturn Roe v. Wade -- which Huey’s campaign says he understands and respects. But we also think it's fair game to say what your opponent ""would"" do if they could. However, we think the word ""ban"" is too sweeping, since Palin, at least, makes an exception for the life of the mother.  We rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC867C40>],/factchecks/2011/jun/08/janice-hahn/california-attack-ad-links-craig-huey-sarah-palin-/

We have dealt with similar Democratic claims that Republican support for dramatic reforms to Medicare means they want to end Medicare, and we have concluded those claims go too far.

This comes from a post to electionforum.org, on May 5, 2011:

The murder mill keeps churning

This makes me sick.

Planned Parenthood gets $350 million in tax dollars each year—nearly $1 million dollars a day. For this, it kills more than 325,000 babies annually. A thousand dollars per abortion…

When we first put that quote to Dave Gilliard, a spokesman for Huey's campaign, he said Huey did not recall ever having used that language to describe Planned Parenthood, though he does want to end federal funding of Planned Parenthood because it provides abortions.

When presented with a link to the post, Gilliard consulted with Huey and said it appeared a staffer for Huey wrote the post.

""From what we can tell, that was posted on his website,"" Gilliard said. ""It's not his language. But he's standing by it, because it's on his website.""

Gilliard said you won't hear Huey using that phrase, but ""he's fine with it. It was on his site.""

It remains to be seen whether linking Palin to an opponent can be an effective political strategy (much as many tried to tie Republican presidential candidates to George W. Bush in the 2008 campaign) but as for the claim that Huey called Planned Parenthood a ""murder mill,"" it's on Huey's website, and he stands by it. We rule the ad's claims True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA04200>],/factchecks/2011/jun/08/janice-hahn/are-craig-hahn-and-sarah-palin-cut-same-political-/
"['Public Safety', 'Transportation', 'Texas', 'Waco Tea Party']","
The Waco Tea Party says the federal government threatened to impose a no-fly zone if Texas bars TSA officials from performing pat-downs
","
Supporting legislation to bar federal officers from ""groping"" passengers during airport security screenings, the Waco Tea Party said in a May 25 email blast: ""The federal government has threatened Texas lawmakers with a no-fly zone if they pass"" the proposal.

House Bill 1937, which stalled in the Senate before the end of the regular session May 30, would make it a misdemeanor offense for public servants, such as Transportation Security Administration officials, to intentionally, knowingly or recklessly touch the private parts of passengers seeking access to public buildings and transportation.

We wondered if the feds really threatened to stop airplanes from flying over Texas if the ban passed.

To our request for backup, Toby Walker, president of the Waco Tea Party, pointed us to a May 24 letter from the U.S. Department of Justice posted online by the Lone Star Report, a weekly newsletter published by the conservative-leaning Lone Star Foundation.

Daryl Fields, a spokesman for the U.S. attorney’s office in the western district of Texas, sent us a copy of the letter, which was addressed to Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst, House Speaker Joe Straus, Robert Haney, chief clerk of the Texas House, and Texas Senate Secretary Patsy Spaw.

In it, U.S. Attorney John Murphy of San Antonio writes: ""This office, as well as the Southern, Northern and Eastern District of Texas United States Attorneys, would like to advise you of the significant legal and practical problems that will be created if this bill becomes law.""

The letter says it appears the intent of the bill is to prevent TSA officials from barring passengers ""who otherwise would have been subjected to a pat down"" from entering the secure area of the airport. It urges lawmakers to ""consider the ramifications of this bill before casting your vote.""

If enacted, the bill would ""directly interfere with the Transportation Security Administration’s responsibility for civil aviation security,"" the letter says. ""The federal government would likely seek an emergency stay of the statute. Unless such a stay were granted, TSA would likely be required to cancel any flight or series of flights for which it could not ensure the safety of passengers and crew.""

Would that make Texas a no-fly zone? 
Generally, a no-fly zone prohibits aircraft from flying in airspace without special permission. Recently, for example, the United Nations signed off on a no-fly zone over Libya to protect Libyans against the government forces of leader Moammar Gadhafi, according to March 18 CNN news article. A March 17 UN press release says the no-fly zone bans all flights except those for humanitarian aid, the evacuation of foreign nationals, or those ""deemed necessary for the benefit of the Libyan people.""

We also found examples of more localized no-fly zones. In February 2010, Connecticut secured a temporary no-fly zone over the site of a power plant explosion due to the instability of the damaged building, according to a Feb. 7, 2010 press release.

When a Wyoming municipal airport opened in 2003, according to the National Park Service, a permanent no-fly zone was created to steer planes clear of Devils Tower National Monument, a sacred site to more than 20 American Indian tribes located near the airport.

And according to a Oct. 15, 2009, news post by a California ABC affiliate, the Federal Aviation Administration imposed a temporary no-fly zone for aircraft within the 10-mile radius where President Barack Obama was staying in Oakland for the duration of a fundraising trip.

Fields, with the U.S. attorney’s office, declined to comment. ""The letter speaks for itself,"" he said.

According to a May 24 Texas Tribune news article, state Sen. Dan Patrick said two TSA officials, not identified in the story, visited him and said it ""could close down all the airports in Texas.""

Dewhurst spokesman Mike Walz said the lieutenant governor ""certainly felt the Department of Justice’s position was threatening.""

John Pike, director of the private Virginia-based company Global Security, which specializes in defense and military background information, speculated that the legislation would effectively grind flights to a halt depending on how many passengers need to be patted down each day — and how many flights would be affected if TSA agents were prohibited from doing so.

Responding to our query, TSA spokesman Luis Casanova told us that approximately 3 percent of airline passengers receive an ""enhanced pat-down."" To put that in context, at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, the state’s largest, TSA screens approximately 50,000 people a day, Casanova said. So some 1,500 receive a pat-down.

We asked if not patting down those people could cause the airport to cancel all flights. Casanova said he couldn’t speculate, but said that TSA shut down one DFW terminal after a person passed security checkpoints without the proper screening.

What earns some passengers extra scrutiny? Casanova said TSA agents must administer a pat-down to any passenger who declines to pass through a metal detector or body scanner, or if the metal-detector alarm continues to sound after the passenger has gone through and agents can’t tell why. According to a TSA blog post updated May 27, TSA officers must resolve each alarm before allowing the related passenger and their baggage on an airplane.

Also, Casanova said, some passengers are randomly subjected to pat-downs — a move designed to deter terrorist activity.

Truth-O-Meter says? The feds raised the specter of canceled flights if the Texas bill passes and if a court doesn’t keep it from taking effect. Exactly how those cancelations would play out, the feds declined to say. In any case, that eventuality is not quite the same as threatening to impose a no-fly zone.

We rate the statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB9BC500>],/factchecks/2011/jun/08/waco-tea-party/waco-tea-party-says-federal-government-threatened-/
"['Florida', 'Tom Rooney']","
Rooney claims $1 spent on disaster mitigation saves $4 later
","
A day after the June 1 start of hurricane season, U.S. Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican whose Florida district includes parts of both the east and west coasts, introduced three bills related to insurance premiums or mitigation from hurricanes and other disasters. In a June 2 press release, he summarized the bills. One of them, the National Disaster Mitigation Act, would provide a tax credit up to $5,000 for homeowners who prepare their homes to reduce the risk of damage from hurricanes and other disasters. That mitigation could include roof repairs or adding shutters, for example.

""Mitigation must be a priority,"" Rooney wrote. ""Too many families and homes remain unnecessarily vulnerable to natural disasters like hurricanes. While mitigation will never eliminate the risk to homeowners, it could reduce loss and, in many cases, save a family’s home. For every $1 spent on mitigation, $4 in post-storm cleanup and rebuilding is saved. These tax credits would provide an important incentive for families to proactively protect their homes from natural disasters.""

For this Truth-O-Meter, we wanted to check if Rooney's figure was correct: For every $1 spent on mitigation, is $4 in post-storm cleanup and rebuilding saved?

We contacted Rooney spokesman Michael Mahaffey to ask for Rooney's source. He told us the claim came from a 2005 study by the National Institute of Building Sciences commissioned by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The study was conducted by the Multihazard Mitigation Council of NIBS, which aims to improve communication among entities involved in disaster mitigation and provide credible information for public policy.

The goal of the study, based on the work of more than 50 national experts, was to ""assess the future savings from hazard mitigation activities.""

The preface of the report gets to the heart of Rooney's claim: ""This study shows that money spent on reducing the risk of natural hazards is a sound investment. On average a dollar spent by FEMA on hazard mitigation (actions to reduce disaster losses) provides the nation with about $4 in future benefits.""

But let's look a little deeper at the study. The purpose of the study was to quantify future savings from mitigation related to losses from earthquake, wind and flood through three major FEMA mitigation programs: Hazard Mitigation Grant Program, Project Impact and the Flood Assistance Mitigation Program -- federally-funded programs that help mitigate future disasters after they happen or ahead of time. (The hazard mitigation and flood assistance programs still exist while Project Impact has since ended -- although FEMA now has other similar programs. For more about these programs, look at FEMA's website.) Two types of mitigations were addressed: ""project"" mitigations such as relocating homes and improving drainage, and ""process"" mitigations such as policies that reduce risk by developing strong building codes, for example.

From page 115 of the full report: ""The total benefits of FEMA hazard mitigation benefits between mid-1993 and mid-2003 are $14.0 billion compared with $3.5 billion in costs. This yields an average cost-benefit ratio of 4.0.""

The study looked at a statistically representative sample of FEMA-funded mitigation grants between 1993 and 2003 and assessed future savings from such mitigation. Benefits were defined as losses avoided, including property damage, business interruption and reduced cost of emergency services.

We interviewed three experts involved in the 2005 study: chair Brent Woodworth, who at the time headed up IBM's crisis response team and is current CEO of the L.A. Emergency Preparedness Foundation; Dennis Mileti, senior research scientist at the National Hazard Center in Boulder, Colo.; and Timothy Reinhold, senior vice president of research and chief engineer at the Institute for Business and Home Safety in Tampa. All three said they believe the statistic would still hold true in 2011 -- though it's an average that could vary depending on the type of mitigation project and location.

The study focuses on FEMA-funded mitigation.

""The study's conclusions are for the nation as a whole and not for individual homeowners,"" Mileti wrote in an e-mail. ""Taking all disaster events into account and all mitigation projects studied into account (some mitigation projects will not experience a disaster and others will), the benefit is 4 to 1 when extrapolated out into the future. Some individuals will reap the benefits (at a greater level than 4 to 1), others will not because they may not have a disaster and the general outcome for the nation as a whole is 4 to 1.""

In a telephone interview, Mileti explained:

""You can't tell a person -- one homeowner in one town who spends thousands on shutters -- that they will end up saving $4 for every $1 they may spend.""

For starters, after the shutters are added, the house may not get hit with a hurricane.

To study all mitigation projects -- including those funded by private companies, individual homeowners, states, counties and cities -- would be ""very, very expensive and unrealistic,"" Mileti said.

We ran the 1:4 ratio by hurricane or mitigation experts in Florida, and all of them said they either cite it, agree with it or thought it might even be higher. We checked with Miles Anderson, Florida's chief of mitigation; Chuck Lanza, director of the Broward County Emergency Management Division; Ricardo Alvarez, mitigation consultant based in Miami; and Sheridan ""Butch"" Truesdale, Senior Mitigation Planner for Palm Beach County.

""I think it's that or greater, depending on the type of project or where it is,"" Anderson said.

We also found the statistic cited in an August 2007 U.S. Government Accountability Office report. And when we asked FEMA, we received an unsigned e-mail from the agency's News Desk that the agency still ""accepts this statistic.""

Rooney claimed that ""for every $1 spent on mitigation, $4 spent on post-storm cleanup and rebuilding is saved."" Rooney took that claim from a valid national study worked on by dozens of experts. But the ratio referred to FEMA-funded mitigation projects -- not necessarily home upgrades paid for by individual homeowners targeted in Rooney's bill. However, the ratio is widely considered to be an industry standard. We rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6D0740>],/factchecks/2011/jun/08/tom-rooney/rooney-claims-1-spent-disaster-mitigation-saves-4-/
"['Crime', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin Professional Police Association']","
Assaults on police have surged, but mostly in Milwaukee County
","
Punched, kicked, pushed, stabbed, shot.

Lobbying against state cuts that could trim local law enforcement funding, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association recently trumpeted a disturbing trend: Assaults against officers in the state have more than doubled in the last five years.

""1,588 Wisconsin officers were assaulted in 2010. Part of a growing trend, the 2010 statistics represent an astonishing increase of 224 percent over the 492 assaults recorded in 2005,"" Jim Palmer, executive director of the group, said in a news release issued May 31, 2011.

""These disturbing figures demonstrate that our state’s law enforcement community is facing a crisis caused by the state’s repeated cuts to the funding it provides to cities to pay for police services.""

The connection between assaults and budget cuts is Palmer’s opinion -- a linkage even he told us is difficult to directly establish. But what about the numbers themselves?

Has there really been a big spike in assaults on police, even as major crime has dropped? We can check that -- and try to get at what lies behind the numbers.

Before we jump in, we should note that assaults are broadly defined. A few  are deadly, and draw the most attention, but about one in five incidents results in injury to an officer. Most involve fists and feet rather than weapons.

Palmer pointed us to state Office of Justice Assistance data that is based on local crime statistics reported to the FBI.

The overall increase cited is on target (though, for the record, the state report we say showed 490 assaults in 2005, not 492). The 224 percent increase moved the state from way below average to average in number of assaults per officer.

But we obtained the county-by-county reports and drilled down.

More than half of Wisconsin’s counties actually reported fewer assaults in 2010 than in 2005, we found. And outside Milwaukee County, assaults were up only 24 percent in the period.

The Milwaukee County numbers, in contrast, were off the charts and driving the statewide increase -- a nearly fivefold increase (486 percent) in the period looked at.

To put that huge leap in focus, consider that Milwaukee County is reporting an increase of more than 1,000 assaults on officers in just six years -- from 212 incidents in 2005 to 1,243 incidents in 2010.

So, while it’s the state union citing the number to bolster its position, it’s more of a Milwaukee-only trend. The association does not represent Milwaukee cops; the separate Milwaukee Police Association does that.

Is it a one-year blip -- or a true ""trend,"" as Palmer said?

The numbers show it has been a steady climb up, year by year, since 2005. In fact, they have been heading up gradually since the mid-1990s.

Palmer called the increase ""astonishing."" Nationally, we found, the number basically has been flat for at least a decade.

Does the huge jump in assaults of officers reflect a growing number of incidents or some change in the way assaults are accounted for -- or a combination of both?

Palmer of the WPPA doesn’t have an answer. He said the state should launch a study of what’s behind the increase.

Milwaukee County District Attorney John Chisholm thinks the trend is real. Criminals are more aggressive, less likely to surrender and are under less intense scrutiny because of cutbacks in federal grants for special crime-fighting efforts, he said.

Milwaukee Police Chief Edward Flynn said lax treatment of young offenders and weak penalties for illegally carrying weapons could explain the trend.

""We have a critical mass of undeterred juvenile offenders entering the adult system,"" Flynn said, ""and now they are carrying firearms because they have learned there is not a great risk of serious sanction.""

Milwaukee Police Association President Mike Crivello says manpower cuts have weakened the show of force necessary to discourage attacks on officers.

Tami Jackson, spokeswoman for the state office that collects the data, said no change in reporting method was apparent in the Milwaukee figures.

Let’s return to the statement and the bottom line:

Lobbying to save funding for law enforcement in communities across the state, the Wisconsin Professional Police Association highlighted an upward surge (224 percent) in reported assaults against law enforcement officers since 2005. The statistics are on point, but while framing it as a statewide problem, the group didn’t note the jump is really centered in the city of Milwaukee. In many other parts of the state, assaults are down.

So, it needed some clarification. That rates a Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECAD7DC0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/08/wisconsin-professional-police-association/assaults-police-have-surged-mostly-milwaukee-count/
"['Georgia', 'Islam', 'Religion', 'Herman Cain']","
Cain denies claims he said he would not appoint Muslims
","
Former pizza CEO and talk show host Herman Cain loves to say he’s not politically correct. Now, his brash words have pushed him to correct the political record.

On ""The Glenn Beck Program"" radio show May 24, the Republican presidential hopeful tried to rebut accusations that in March he said he would not appoint Muslims to Cabinet positions or federal judgeships in a potential Cain administration.  

""I did not say that I would not have them in my Cabinet. Because if you look at my career, I have hired good people regardless of race, religion, sex, gender or orientation and this sort of thing,"" Cain told Beck.  

This statement, made just three days after Cain’s May 21 announcement that he is running for president, was only his latest attempt to put the controversy to rest. Reporters have dogged him on the issue for two months.

""People are trying to push me in a corner,"" he groused in April to The Daily Caller, a news website founded by conservatives.

No one puts Herman Cain in a corner. But fact-check him? We can’t resist.

What did he say in March about appointing Muslims to his Cabinet?

We called and emailed the Cain campaign for comment. It did not respond, so we proceeded without it.

Metro Atlantans are accustomed to Cain as an agitator. He’s been goading liberals for years as a conservative talk show host on AM 750 and 95.5FM News/Talk WSB.

Cain’s comments about Muslims barely made news locally, but with the growth of his support, he faces more scrutiny than ever before.

Now we’re learning whether what plays with metro Atlanta conservatives works on the national stage.  

The controversy began in February in a Milner church. Cain talked about his bout with stage four liver and colon cancer and suggested he was uncomfortable when he learned his surgeon’s name was ""Abdallah.""

The evangelical publication Christianity Today asked Cain about his comment in a March 21 article. Cain replied that Muslims should stop trying to convert others.

""And based upon the little knowledge that I have of the Muslim religion, you know, they have an objective to convert all infidels or kill them,"" Cain said.

Five days later, a blogger for liberal ThinkProgress.org questioned him at the Conservative Principles Conference in Des Moines, Iowa.

""Would you be comfortable appointing a Muslim either in your Cabinet or as a federal judge?"" the blogger asked.

""No, I will not,"" Cain replied. ""And here’s why. There is this creeping attempt, there’s this attempt to gradually ease Sharia law and the Muslim faith into our government. It does not belong in our government.""

By that Monday, Cain was explaining his comments to national media outlets. He’s been at it ever since.

This brings us back to Beck’s radio show, where Cain said his statement was ""misconstrued.""

""[The reporter] said, would you be comfortable with a Muslim in your Cabinet?"" Cain told Beck. ""And I immediately said, without thinking, ‘No, I would not be comfortable.’ I did not say that I would not have them in my Cabinet. Because if you look at my career, I have hired good people regardless of race, religion, sex, gender or orientation and this sort of thing. ""

Indeed, the question the ThinkProgress.org blogger asked Cain was whether he would be ""comfortable"" with a Muslim in his Cabinet, not whether he would appoint one. If you take the video on its face, the explanation Cain gave on Beck’s show seems reasonable.

The problem is that it contradicts what Cain said about his own comments.  

The Monday after the news broke, Cain recounted what he said on Fox News’ ""Your World with Neil Cavuto.""

""A reporter asked me ‘Would I appoint a Muslim to my administration?’ I did say ‘no,’ "" Cain told Cavuto.

""And here’s why ... I would have to have people totally committed to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. And many of the Muslims, they’re not totally dedicated to this country,"" he said.  

In April, Cain repeated he would not hire a Muslim to radio host Bryan Fischer, who is also a conservative. We found an excerpt from the show on a website critical of the political right:

""[T]he comment I made that became controversial, and my staff keeps hoping will die, is that I wouldn’t have Muslims in my administration. And it’s real simple. The Constitution does not have room for Sharia law ... and to introduce that element as part of an administration when we’ve got all of these other issues, I think I have the right to say that I won’t,"" Cain said.  

Cain’s opposition to Muslims in his Cabinet is not ironclad. After some prodding, he told Cavuto he might consider a Muslim who’s loyal to the Constitution but never met one he would choose for his Cabinet.

Still, contrary to his claim on Beck’s program, Cain did say he would not have Muslims in his Cabinet. Not once or twice, but three times in as many weeks to ThinkProgress.org, Cavuto and Fischer.

When scrutiny grew stronger, Cain backtracked. During Beck’s program, he parted ways with the truth. The heat is on, and Cain’s Pants are on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDD82200>],/factchecks/2011/jun/08/herman-cain/cain-denies-claims-he-said-he-would-not-appoint-mu/

Chain e-mail accuses Barack Obama of hypocrisy in raid on Osama bin Laden
","
A reader recently forwarded us a chain e-mail that’s been making the rounds, accusing President Barack Obama of hypocrisy over the raid that resulted in the killing of al-Qaida leader Osama bin Laden on May 1, 2011. A Google search also indicated that the text of the e-mail has been popping up widely in blogs and comment threads. 
Here’s the full text of the version we received:

""Here are the facts, you be the judge. These words were spoken by the same man in 2008 and then again in 2011.

""Short and  sweet…

""OBAMA'S OWN  WORDS TRAP HIM:  

""2008: ‘Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.’
""2011: ‘I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.’

""2008: ‘Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty, and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.’
""2011: ‘I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.’

""2008: ‘Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.’
""2011: ‘Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.’

""I HOPE THIS  GETS SENT AROUND TO PEOPLE WHO CARE ABOUT THE  TRUTH!""

We thought we’d look into whether the quotations in the e-mail were accurate. We did extensive searches on Google, in the Lexis-Nexis news database and the White House’s own website, as well as checking with a few experts. The White House did not respond to our query.

While it’s impossible to prove a negative, we found no evidence to support the notion that Obama said any of these things. In fact, several of the statements are directly contradicted by the evidence we found.

We’ll take the quotes one by one.

2008: ""Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team.""

We found occasional references in the media to ""assassination teams"" that were answerable to Vice President Dick Cheney, but no evidence that Obama ever said anything of the sort.

In a March 11, 2009, speech at the University of Minnesota, veteran investigative reporter Seymour Hersh referred to the Joint Special Operations Command -- a ""special wing of our special operations community that is set up independently,"" as he put it. ""They do not report to anybody, except in the Bush-Cheney days, they reported directly to the Cheney office. ... Congress has no oversight of it. It’s an executive assassination ring essentially....""

Later, during the July 15, 2009, edition of Countdown with Keith Olbermann -- a now-defunct nightly show on MSNBC -- the liberal host introduced a segment by saying that it was ""time to look at what we know about the Bush-Cheney assassination teams."" The segment addressed purported assassination efforts under both the CIA and the Pentagon. The latter ""sent killing teams into the field, where they actually killed people,"" including those affiliated with al-Qaida, Olbermann said.

Almost two years later, such comments became somewhat prescient, when details of the bin Laden raid became known. The counter-terrorist team that carried out the raid was the Naval Special Warfare Development Group, or DevGru for short. (The team is popularly, though incorrectly, known by one of its several former names, SEAL Team Six."") DevGru has been around since the early 1980s, usually shrouded in secrecy given its sensitive work. According to globalsecurity.org, it is a ""component"" of the Joint Special Operations Command.

From what’s been reported, it’s unclear whether DevGru truly was answerable to Cheney during his two terms as vice president. But the group existed, and the bin Laden raid certainly suggests that it has the ability -- at least in some cases -- to act as an ""assassination team.""

Still, the e-mail is wrong to suggest that Obama ever said or wrote that ""Navy Seal Team 6 is Cheney's private assassination team"" before he became president (or, for that matter, after).

2011: ""I put together Seal Team 6 to take out Bin Laden.""

During his May 1, 2011, announcement of bin Laden’s death, Obama detailed his role in ordering the bin Laden raid. But he never claimed that he had created the unit that carried out the raid (which he didn’t, in any case).

Obama said in his announcement that shortly after he took office, ""I directed Leon Panetta, the director of the CIA, to make the killing or capture of bin Laden the top priority of our war against al-Qaida, even as we continued our broader efforts to disrupt, dismantle, and defeat his network. … Last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.

""Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability. No Americans were harmed.  They took care to avoid civilian casualties.  After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.""

In a lengthy interview conducted on May 4, 2011, Obama sounded a similar note.

""Obviously we have extraordinary guys,"" Obama told Steve Kroft of the CBS newsmagazine 60 Minutes. ""Our Special Forces are the best of the best. And so I was not involved in designing the initial plan. But each iteration of that plan they'd bring back to me. Make a full presentation. We would ask questions. We had multiple meetings in the Situation Room in which we would map out -- and we would actually have a model of the compound and discuss how this operation might proceed, and what various options there were because there was more than one way in which we might go about this.""

We did not find any evidence that Obama had claimed to have created the special forces team that carried out the raid.

2008: ""Bin Laden is innocent until proven guilty and must be captured alive and given a fair trial.""

Obama never said this. In fact, he took the opposite stance in one of the presidential debates in 2008.

""If we have Osama bin Laden in our sights and the Pakistani government is unable or unwilling to take them out, then I think that we have to act, and we will take them out,"" Obama said. ""We will kill bin Laden. We will crush al-Qaida. That has to be our biggest national security priority.""

After the raid, we rated his promise to ""kill bin Laden"" as a Promise Kept.

The closest we could find was a comment -- quickly retracted -- that was made in 2003 by Howard Dean. Dean, the former governor of Vermont, was running for the Democratic presidential nomination at the time.

In December 2003, Dean told the Concord Monitor that he had ""resisted pronouncing a sentence (on bin Laden) before guilt is found. I still have this old-fashioned notion that even with people like Osama, who is very likely to be found guilty, we should do our best not to, in positions of executive power, not to prejudge jury trials.""

After a flurry of condemnations, Dean reversed course just a few hours later. He told the Associated Press that, ""as an American, I want to make sure he gets the death penalty he deserves."" He also issued a statement that said in part, ""Bin Laden has admitted that he is responsible for killing 3,000 Americans as well as scores of men, women and children around the world. This is exactly the kind of case that the death penalty is meant for.""

2011: ""I authorized Seal Team 6 to kill Bin Laden.""

Obama didn’t use the phrasing cited in the chain e-mail, but as we indicated earlier, there’s no question that he took responsibility for ordering the raid.

There is evidence that U.S. forces would have accepted a surrender by bin Laden, rather than killing him, under certain circumstances. After the raid, according to ABC News, State Department legal adviser Harold Koh wrote in a blog post that forces were prepared to capture bin Laden if he had ""surrendered in a way that they could safely accept"" in accordance with the laws of armed conflict which require the acceptance of a ""genuine offer"" of surrender, ""clearly communicated by the surrendering party"" under circumstances where it would be feasible for the forces to accept the offer of surrender.

Still, Koh wrote that bin Laden was a lawful target under the Authorization for Use of Military Force passed by Congress in 2001. It allows military force against those that have ""planned, authorized, committed or aided the terrorist attacks"" of Sept. 11, 2001.

2008: ""Guantanamo is entirely unnecessary, and the detainees should not be interrogated.""

This statement has a grain of truth, but it is exaggerated.

During the campaign, Obama made no secret of his disagreement with elements of the Bush Administration’s national security policy. He promised to ""close the detention facility at Guantanamo"" (which we have rated a Promise Broken) and to ""end the use of torture without exception"" (which we have rated In the Works).

Obama’s desire to close Guantanamo could be construed as him believing that the facility is ""entirely unnecessary,"" but it’s wrong to say that he believed that detainees shouldn’t be interrogated. Interrogation is a standard procedure in law enforcement and intelligence. Obama wanted to end the use of torture.

We also found no evidence that Obama uttered these words.

2011: ""Vital intelligence was obtained from Guantanamo detainees that led to our locating Bin Laden.""

Some, including Cheney, have suggested that the Bin Laden raid benefited from intelligence gained through interrogation techniques that Obama has criticized as torture. This question has not been definitively settled, although the White House downplayed the possibility.

""Reporting from detainees was just a slice of the information that has been gathered by incredibly diligent professionals over the years in the intelligence community,"" White House spokesman Jay Carney said on May 3, 2011. ""And it simply strains credulity to suggest that a piece of information that may or may not have been gathered in -- eight years ago somehow directly led to a successful mission on Sunday. That's just not the case.""

John Pike, the director of globalsecurity.org, said that the words attributed to Obama on Guantanamo ""are ludicrous. It is not something he would have said, and there is no evidence that it is something that he did say.""

And in this case too, we found no evidence that Obama uttered the words attributed to him. 
""As you may know I have been critical of Obama's national security policies,"" said Professor Jeff Addicott, director of the Center for Terrorism Law at St. Mary's University School of Law. ""That said, I have never heard him make the 2008 remarks, and I follow him very closely.

Our ruling 
A few of the sentiments have some link to reality – Obama did order the raid to kill bin Laden, and he did oppose Guantanamo, even though he ultimately failed to carry through on his promise to close it. The critics may have wished Obama had made these statements, but appears the statements have no basis in reality. It's clear from our research that all six quotes are fabrications. Once again a widely circulated chain e-mail is spreading ridiculous falsehoods about Obama. We rate this e-mail Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBFBF80>],/factchecks/2011/jun/07/chain-email/chain-e-mail-accuses-barack-obama-hypocrisy-raid-o/
"['Abortion', 'Florida', 'Marjorie Dannenfelser']","
Abortion opponents claim Planned Parenthood had $300 million 'profit'
","
A debate in Congress earlier this year about whether to yank millions of dollars in federal funding for Planned Parenthood spawned a whole slew of claims by politicians about abortion. The Truth-O-Meter weighed in on several claims: everything from a claim by Republican presidential candidate Herman Cain that Planned Parenthood's early objective was to ""help kill black babies before they came into the world,"" which got a Pants on Fire, to Richard Corcoran, a Florida state representative, who claimed that ""90 percent of babies with Down syndrome are aborted,"" which received a True rating.

Before we delve into a new claim about Planned Parenthood, here is a summary about the debate from an April 21 fact-check by our colleagues at PolitiFact National:

""Even though Planned Parenthood cannot use federal money to provide abortions, Republicans passed an amendment in the U.S. House in February that would block all federal funding to the group. Republicans contend that any support for Planned Parenthood can provide indirect support for abortions. The amendment, which did not have sufficient support to pass the Senate, was a key issue in the budget debate that nearly led to a government shutdown on April 8, 2011. It was not included in the budget agreement that prevented the shutdown.""

Planned Parenthood receives about $363 million a year from the federal government, which can be used for cancer screenings, annual exams, birth control and other preventative services.

Now, a leader of an organization that advocates for pro-life legislation claims that Planned Parenthood is a money-maker. The claim comes from a U.S. News and World Report Washington Whispers blog on May 26 about U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz -- the Democratic National Committee chair who represents part of South Florida -- who called the GOP ""anti-women"" after the vote to de-fund Planned Parenthood. In response, Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said: ""The truly ‘anti-woman’ organization here is Planned Parenthood and the party that continues to defend its taxpayer funding when it has raked in more than $300 million in profits over the past four years. Fifty-four percent of Americans don’t want to be coerced into contributing to an organization they don’t believe in just by paying their taxes — nor should they be.""

For this Truth-O-Meter, we wanted to check Dannenfelser's claim that Planned Parenthood ""raked in more than $300 million in profits over the past four years."" We'll focus on two parts: Is the dollar figure right, and is 'profit' the right word?

We contacted SBA List spokeswoman Mallory Quigley, who referred us to ""excess of revenue over expenses"" listed in Planned Parenthood's annual reports. Here is what those reports show:

2005-06: $55.8 million
2006-07: $114.8 million
2007-08: $85 million
2008-09: $63.4 million

Total: $319 million.

Although Planned Parenthood doesn't dispute the numbers pulled from the annual reports, a spokesman says it's not that simple. Spokesman Tait Sye notes that the full text of that line in the annual report for 2008-09 is ""excess of revenue over expenses excluding investment losses."" He points to the next line showing that the organization lost $78.1 million in investments that year, which should be subtracted from the four-year total. He also says that the group sometimes receives multi-year grants that show up as revenue in one year but are really spread out over several years. 
In the reports from other years, the financial data does not refer to investment losses or gains, and Sye said those amounts were simply included in the totals for those years. The extraordinary losses when the markets plunged for almost all investors, presented differently in the 2008-09 report, makes it awkward to combine the four years since Planned Parenthood didn't detail its investment losses or gains previously. Subtracting the $78 million would leave the group with about $240 million in revenue over expenses in the four-year period. But how much more or less is unknown since we were unable to obtain the actual investment income for the other years. 
We asked the SBA List why it didn't factor in the investment losses. Quigley responded: ""We added up the bottom-line numbers that Planned Parenthood listed for excess revenue."" 
We think the number is somewhat overstated because of those 2008-09 losses, but we can't tell by how much. 
In the second part of our fact-checking, does the ""excess revenue over expenses"" constitute a ""profit""?

We sent Dannenfelser's claim to experts in nonprofit management and heard back from four. Three disagreed with using the term ""profit"" to describe excess revenues over expenses: Christopher Stone, faculty director of the Hauser Center for Nonprofit Organizations at Harvard University; Herman B. ""Dutch"" Leonard, professor of public management at Harvard Kennedy School of Government and at the Harvard Business School; and Beth Gazley, assistant professor at Indiana University School of Public and Environmental Affairs.

""Bottom line: a nonprofit’s surplus should not be confused with profit,"" Stone wrote in an e-mail. ""Profits are generated by businesses to reward investors. Businesses also use profits to provide additional compensation (bonuses tied to profits) for employees who help generate the profits for investors. Because nonprofits may not use their surpluses for either of these purposes, these surpluses should not be confused with profits. All surpluses must be devoted to the charitable purposes of the organization.""

And Gazley wrote: ""But more to the point, the 'taxpayer'-funded portions of the Planned Parenthood affiliates’ budgets are either program grants or reimbursements for services eligible for Medicaid. So the government-funded parts of the (Planned Parenthood) budget would NOT be generating a 'profit' – they would be used in full each year. This means any excess of revenues over expenses (AKA 'profit') would have come from other sources – private donations, endowment income, etc. So Ms. Dannenfelser’s argument that the taxpayers are somehow subsidizing this 'profit' is misleading.""

We asked Gazley how she knew the taxpayer portions were not the source of the excess revenue.

She cited her 16 years of experience as a fundraiser and management consultant for nonprofits, and her service as both a board member and past president of a developmental disabilities agency that is primarily Medicaid funded. ""Based on my experience with other NPOs, it is very hard (to carry a surplus of federal funding from year to year) given the care that is taken in the calculation of formulas to reimburse only for real costs,"" she wrote.

Sye, the Planned Parenthood spokesman, also said the federal funds are not part of the excess of revenue over expenses -- in fact, he said, the government money never covers the full cost of services.

Back to whether we can call that excess of revenue over expenses a ""profit.""

Terri Renner, longtime CPA and lecturer at Indiana University's school of Public and Environmental Affairs, argued that ""the excess of revenues over expenses is the accounting definition of profit.""

""Any time an organization of any kind has revenue that exceeds expenses - it's making a 'profit,' "" Renner wrote in an e-mail. ""NPOs don't like that word - so they use different vocabulary ('revenues over expenses'). The key difference is that for-profit organizations usually distribute part of the excess to the owners as compensation for their investment and reinvest the rest back into the company. NPOs reinvest all of the money back into the organization - theoretically."" 
Planned Parenthood, of course, disagrees with characterizing the sum as a profit.

""To be clear, Planned Parenthood is a nonprofit entity and so we do not generate a profit,"" Sye said. ""Obviously the reserves are reinvested to meet the health care needs of women we serve. Every healthy nonprofit will have reserves.""

We asked Quigley of the SBA List, why refer to this figure as a ""profit"" for a nonprofit?

She responded by e-mail:

""We feel the point is clear — we’re not saying nonprofits shouldn’t have a profit, but rather wish to point to excess in profit and question why this organization would need to be supplemented by American taxpayers. Planned Parenthood does not need to receive $363 million in taxpayer funding per year.""

Let's return to Dannenfelser's claim:

""The truly ‘anti-woman’ organization here is Planned Parenthood and the party that continues to defend its taxpayer funding when it has raked in more than $300 million in profits over the past four years.""

We said we'd examine both the dollar figure and the word ""profits."" We think the ""more than $300 million"" description is off base because of the $78 million in losses, but neither Planned Parenthood nor the SBA List is saying definitively what the investment gains or losses were for the four-year period. Still, there is some element of truth in that it's at least scores of millions of dollars. 
In the second part of our ruling, we looked at whether ""excess revenue over expenses"" for a nonprofit is the same as ""profit."" Most of the experts we consulted say no. And the one who would call it profit agrees that it's not treated the same way as profit for a corporation. Companies distribute their profits to shareholders and owners, while nonprofits put their excess revenues back into the organization's work. We think the real sting in this claim comes from the word ""profits,"" so we weighed that more heavily than the vague dollar figures in our ruling. We rate this claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDAE580>],/factchecks/2011/jun/07/marjorie-dannenfelser/abortion-opponents-claim-planned-parenthood-had-30/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'Charlotte Nash']","
Best school district? Not so fast.
","
Georgia officials sure do like to brag about where they live.

DeKalb County has proclaimed itself the ""greenest county in America."" We reviewed that claim in December and rated it Barely True.

Now comes this from Charlotte Nash, the new chairwoman of the Gwinnett County Commission.

""We have the best schools in the United States,"" Nash said in her May 18 State of the County address.

How could we resist doing our homework about this claim?

Gwinnett government spokeswoman Heather Sawyer said Nash based her statement on Gwinnett County Public Schools winning the 2010 Broad Foundation Prize as the nation’s best large, urban school district. The County Commission, by the way, has no direct involvement in the management of Gwinnett’s public schools.

The prize, which Gwinnett won in October, is considered one of the most prestigious awards in education. It also comes with $1 million in scholarship money for high school students. Fifty-one Gwinnett students received scholarships. The eight-member selection jury included three former U.S. secretaries of education.

Some might question how a county with cow pastures is considered an urban school district, but it met the foundation’s qualifications in two key categories. Nearly 50 percent of Gwinnett students are eligible for free or reduced lunch (the Broad requirement is at least 40 percent). Also, nearly 70 percent of Gwinnett students are black, Latino or Asian(the Broad requirement is at least 40 percent).

The foundation cited several factors for awarding Gwinnett. They included: 
Gwinnett school officials provided us more information. It included: 


Jorge Quintana, the Gwinnett school district’s media relations director, noted that the county was a finalist for the Broad Prize in 2009.

""The fact that Gwinnett was a finalist for the same prestigious award the year before indicates that the district has been successful in sustaining success over time,"" Quintana told us in an email.

Those factors suggest Gwinnett gets high marks in Georgia. But is Gwinnett the best district in the country?

""[The Broad Prize] certainly would put you in that category,"" said Dan Domenech, executive director of the American Association of School Administrators, a 13,000-member organization that aims to assist the nation’s public schools.

Still, Domenech, who said Gwinnett has an ""excellent"" reputation, said it is difficult to determine the nation’s best school system.

""There probably isn’t a best school district in the country,"" he said. ""There are a lot of good school districts in the country.""

The Washington Post compiles a widely discussed annual list that ranks the nation’s best public high schools in terms of college preparedness. In 2011, the Gwinnett and Fulton school districts each had six schools among the top 500 on the Post’s list, tying for the most in Georgia. Gwinnett was behind a district in Houston, Texas, (10 schools among the top 500), the Hillsborough County, Fla., district (nine schools among the top 500) and a district in Dallas, Texas, that had the top two schools on the list and an additional six among the top 500.

The Post determines the ranking by dividing the number of Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate or other college-level tests a school gave in 2010 by the number of graduating seniors.

Domenech suggested we use several criteria in our research, such as exams like the SAT, graduation rates, dropout rates and parent reaction.

On the SAT exam, the average score for Gwinnett students (1,532) was higher than the state and national averages, but it was lower than the averages for Fulton and Fayette counties.

The state Education Department recently released data outlining how each school district fared on the high school graduation tests. In Gwinnett, 83.8 percent of students passed all the exams, easily above the statewide average of 73.7 percent. Gwinnett finished behind the Cherokee, Cobb, Fayette and Forsyth school districts. Gwinnett, it must be noted, had more students than those other districts and is the state’s largest school system. The Gwinnett School of Math, Science and Technology in Lawrenceville had a 100 percent passing rate on four portions of the graduation test on English/language arts, math, science and social studies, The Atlanta Journal-Constitution reported Monday.

Nash has some reasons to brag about the schools in her county. Students, teachers and parents have reason to be proud. Nash, however, made a bold statement based on Gwinnett winning the 2010 Broad Prize for the best urban school district. Seventy-five districts in the U.S. qualified for consideration for the prize in 2010. That’s less than 1 percent of the nation’s 14,000 school districts.

Her claim also omits some critical facts, such as Gwinnett’s average score in some key academic categories. The county was behind some other Atlanta-area districts. Also, Gwinnett had fewer schools than some other U.S. districts on the Washington Post’s list. As Domenech told us, it’s tough to say there is one school district that is the nation’s best.

Under our guidelines, Nash’s claim rates as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBADDC0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/07/charlotte-nash/best-school-district-claim-gets-red-marks/
"['Ohio', 'State Budget', 'William G. Batchelder']","
Ohio House Speaker William G. Batchelder says the consumers' council office has 74 lawyers on staff
","
Absent a dramatic reversal, the Office of the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel will be classified a budget loser once lawmakers finalize the state’s two-year spending plan in the coming weeks.

Republican Gov. John Kasich and Republican lawmakers have taken direct aim at the office, which is charged with protecting Ohio consumers in utility cases.

The GOP-controlled House of Representatives supported Kasich’s proposal to cut 51 percent of the agency’s funding and added provisions to muzzle the office on issues related to natural gas markets and to eliminate the counsel’s call center, a repository for consumer complaints.

National consumer groups sharply criticized the proposals, claiming they would prevent the office from fulfilling its mission.

House Speaker William G. Batchelder, a Republican from Medina, was asked recently about the proposed cuts.

Batchelder, echoing similar reasoning from Kasich, said the cuts are justified because the agency is overstaffed and because it plays a role similar to the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio.

Supporters of the consumers’ counsel say the office plays a watchdog role separate from the PUCO, which decides whether to approve rate increases the utilities propose.

""There are 74, I believe, attorneys in that office,"" Batchelder said on the Ohio News Network’s ""Capitol Square"" on May 29. ""Is that duplicative? Is it wasteful? And I think since the legislature was busy with an axe on everything else, it makes it pretty hard to sell having the duplication or having 74 lawyers. I don’t know how many the attorney general has.""

PolitiFact Ohio thought 74 seemed awfully high and decided to check out the speaker’s claim.

It didn’t take long to conclude Batchelder was wrong.

The agency has a total of 82 employees, according to a staff listing the OCC provided. Of those workers, only 14 are attorneys. Some workers are part-time, meaning the office’s staffing level equates to 72 full-time workers.

""We currently have 12 attorneys on staff assigned to case work and two vacancies. In addition to the 12 staff attorneys, the Consumers’ Counsel Janine Migden-Ostrander and the Deputy Consumers’ Counsel Bruce Weston are also attorneys,"" OCC spokeswoman Beth Gianforcaro wrote in an e-mail.

Other departments at the OCC include the analytical department, communications, operations and the call center. Migden-Ostrander has said a 51 percent budget cut – from $8.5 million to $4.1 million, as Kasich and the House proposed – would result in layoffs and the elimination of the call center.

But cutting the agency’s budget won’t save the state money. The office is entirely funded from fees levied on the state’s utilities, not tax dollars. Spending less money on the OCC would only put money back in the utilities’ pockets.

On May 31, the Senate unveiled its budget proposal, which reduced the OCC’s cut to 34 percent and removed the prohibition on the counsel talking about natural gas markets, which some called a ""gag order.""

A spokesman for Batchelder said the speaker misspoke about the number of attorneys in the office.

""He was trying to assert there were 74 employees at the office of the consumers’ counsel and not 74 attorneys,"" Batchelder spokesman Mike Dittoe said. ""We apologize for the slip of the tongue there.""

We’ll allow that the speaker may have misspoke, rather than purposefully misused the statistics he cited. But he did repeat the inaccuracy, and wondered aloud how that number of lawyers compared with the staff of Attorney General Mike DeWine, Ohio’s top lawyer. And the number itself is so overstated that it ecllipses the total staffing level of the consumers’ counsel office.

Furthermore, his complaint about duplication of services and wasteful spending when the state is ""busy with an axe on everything"" is misleading because funding for the Ohio Consumers’ Counsel doesn’t come from general tax revenues. Rather, it is raised through fees levied on utilities.

PolitiFact Ohio has noted before that as speaker, Batchelder is one of the most influential politicians in the state and Ohioans listen to what he says. In this case, he made the claim on a television broadcast on a statewide news network.

And in this case his statement is not just inaccurate, but also makes a ridiculous claim.

When that happens, the Truth-O-Meter points to one rating: Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB844300>],/factchecks/2011/jun/07/bill-batchelder/ohio-house-speaker-william-g-batchelder-says-consu/
"['National', 'History', 'Pundits', 'Sarah Palin']","
Was trash-talking the British part of Paul Revere's ride?
","In another weird twist to her family vacation bus tour, Sarah Palin got herself in a bit of a press dust-up when she dabbled in a folksy version of early American history. The subject: Paul Revere.

Here's the quote in question:

""He who warned the British that they weren't gonna be takin' away our arms by ringing those bells, and makin' sure as he's riding his horse through town to send those warning shots and bells that we were going to be sure and we were going to be free, and we were going to be armed.""

Many media outlets quickly pounced, saying Palin needed a history lesson.

We were frankly going to let this one go. It seemed to us like perhaps an impromptu slip up.

But then Palin doubled down in a June 5 interview with Chris Wallace on Fox News.

""You realize that you messed up about Paul Revere, don't you?"" Wallace asked.

""I didn't mess up about Paul Revere,"" Palin said. ""Here is what Paul Revere did. He warned the Americans that the British were coming, the British were coming, and they were going to try to take our arms and we got to make sure that we were protecting ourselves and shoring up all of our ammunitions and our firearms so that they couldn’t take it. But remember that the British had already been there, many soldiers for seven years in that area. And part of Paul Revere’s ride — and it wasn’t just one ride — he was a courier, he was a messenger. ""Part of his ride was to warn the British that were already there. That, hey, you’re not going to succeed. You’re not going to take American arms. You are not going to beat our own well-armed persons, individual, private militia that we have. He did warn the British. And in a shout-out, gotcha type of question that was asked of me, I answered candidly. And I know my American history.""

We don't remember anything about Revere trash-talking to the British in the version of events from the Henry Wadsworth Longfellow poem ""Paul Revere's Ride."" But it's probably not wise to go with a poem for the last word on history.

Not at all wise, according to a Maine Historical Society website account of Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's famous poem.

""The basic premise of Longfellow's poem is historically accurate, but Paul Revere's role is exaggerated,"" the historical group states. ""The most glaring inconsistencies between the poem and the historical record are that Revere was not the only rider that night, nor did he make it all the way to Concord, but was captured and then let go (without his horse) in Lexington, where he had stopped to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock of the impending attack.

""Longfellow's intention was not to write a history; it was to create a national hero, and he was successful at doing so.""

So let's go to accounts from Revere himself.

The Massachusetts Historical Society has two accounts of the night of April 18, 1775, from Revere. The first came via a deposition, likely prepared at the request of the Massachusetts Provincial Congress to prove who fired the first shot at Lexington. The second, in which he provides a similar account, comes from a letter Revere wrote in 1798.

In both accounts, Revere recounted that he received instruction from Dr. Joseph Warren, a leader among the Patriots, to ride to Lexington to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock that English troops were moving toward Lexington and/or Concord. The historical society notes that Revere recounted that he ""secured a horse in Charlestown, avoided British officers near Charlestown Common, and reached Lexington (where he conveyed the message to Adams and Hancock). He set out for Concord with William Dawes and Samuel Prescott, but halfway there, he was captured by British soldiers.""

We'll pick up here with Revere's own words from the 1798 letter, explaining that after he was captured, a British commander began to question him:

""He asked me if  I was an express. I answered in the affirmative. He demanded what time I left Boston? I told him; and added, that their troops had catched aground in passing the River, and that there would be five hundred Americans there in a short time, for I had alarmed the Country all the way up.""

In the 1775 deposition, Revere simply said ""500 men""  -- rather than 500 Americans -- were gathering to face the ""Regulars"" (the British).

In his 1994 book, ""Paul Revere's Ride,"" author David Hackett Fischer relied on historical documents to recount this passage:

With six pistols pointed at him, Revere spoke with a spirit the British officers found infuriating in a provincial prisoner, who seemed not to know his place, or to care about the danger he faced. One of the prisoners, Elijah Sanderson, listened at a distance and later remembered, ""I heard him pick up with energy to them.""

""Gentlemen,"" Revere told them, ""you've missed of your aim.""

""What of our aim?"" one answered in a ""hard"" tone. Another insisted that they were out after deserters, a frequent employment of British officers in America.

""I know better,"" Paul Revere boldly replied. ""I know what you are after, and I have alarmed the country all the way up.""

So Palin is correct about one point: Revere did warn the British that they were going to face armed resistance from some 500 colonists.

But Palin's comment suggests Revere was ""running around ringing bells and warning the British,"" said James Giblin, author of The Many Rides of Paul Revere.  ""He wasn't, of course.""

""He was captured by the British and never made it to Concord,"" Giblin said. ""While he was a prisoner of the British, he warned them they might meet a strong force of Americans. He was sort of boastful, telling them, 'You don't know what kind of force you're going to encounter at Concord.' He was propagandizing for the rebels.""

""She really needed a fact-checker before she spoke,"" Gilbin said.

Again, here's what Palin said in her Fox News interview, after she'd been challenged on her initial account of Revere's ride. ""Part of his ride was to warn the British that were already there that, ""Hey, you're not going to succeed. You're not going to take American arms. You are not going to beat our own well-armed persons, individual, private militia that we have...He did warn the British.""

Again, it so happens that after he was captured, Revere did ""warn"" (or boast) that armed Americans were awaiting the British militia. Palin's comments touch on this little-known part of history. But Palin's comment clearly suggests that one of Revere's aims that night was to warn the British. It was not. His aim -- in his own words -- was solely to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock of British troop movement. We rate Palin's comment Barely True.   
Editor's note: This statement was rated Barely True when it was published. On July 27, 2011, we changed the name for the rating to Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEC7600>],/factchecks/2011/jun/06/sarah-palin/was-trash-talking-british-part-paul-reveres-ride/

Austan Goolsbee says current recovery beats job creation record of George W. Bush recovery
","
On the heels of a disappointing jobs report, Austan Goolsbee, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Barack Obama, shined the best light he could on the administration’s economic record during the June 5, 2011, edition of ABC’s This Week with Christiane Amanpour.
   
Two days before his appearance, the government announced that the economy had created a net of only 54,000 jobs in May -- a number well below expectations, and also below the number of jobs created in the previous few months.

""I would just emphasize, the president's plan is putting us on the right track,"" Goolsbee told Amanpour. ""Over the last 15 months, we've added more than 2 million jobs in the private sector. That's far in excess of what it was in the comparable period after the last recession.""

We thought it was worth checking whether the current recovery is strong by historical standards. So we turned to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the government’s official source for employment numbers.

Between February 2010 and May 2011 -- the 15-month period Goolsbee was referring to -- the U.S. economy created 2.1 million private-sector jobs. By contrast, following the previous recession, the economy actually lost 60,000 private-sector jobs during the equivalent period, which ran from August 2002 to November 2003.

So Goolsbee’s statistic was factually correct. But the Truth-O-Meter also gives weight to context, and we think there are some important bits of context that Goolsbee left out.

One concern we have is why Goolsbee offered the time frame he did. According to the official arbiter of recessions -- the National Bureau of Economic Research, a nonpartisan group of academic economists -- the most recent recession ended in June 2009. But Goolsbee’s statistic starts counting eight months later, in February 2010.

Why does this matter? It doubles the amount of jobs created during the Obama recovery. ""In effect, he's saying let's forget all those bad months and just look at the good ones,"" said J.D. Foster, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation.

As we noted, using Goolsbee’s 15-month calculation, the economy produced a net of 2.1 million private-sector jobs. But if you count the full 23 months since the recovery officially began, this number shrinks to 980,000. (Using private-sector jobs in the first place also produces a more favorable number to the administration; over the full 23-month period, only 550,000 total jobs were created, due to major job losses in the government sector.)

Our second concern has to do with using the George W. Bush recovery as a point of comparison.

There’s little question that the Obama recovery is stronger than the George W. Bush recovery -- in large part because the Bush recovery was so anemic. Not only did the Bush recovery produce job losses during the 15-month period Goolsbee cited, but it also produced job losses over the full 23-month period. Over the first 23 months of the Bush recovery, the economy actually lost 757,000 private-sector jobs and 577,000 total jobs.

But comparing the Obama recovery to other recoveries in recent decades results in a more mixed picture. We looked at the aftermaths of recessions that ran from July 1990 to March 1991, President George H.W. Bush; from July 1981 to November 1982, under President Ronald Reagan; and from January 1980 to July 1980, under President Jimmy Carter.

The recoveries following the George H.W. Bush and Ronald Reagan recessions were more notably robust in both private-sector and total jobs created than the current recovery has been. The recovery after the Reagan recession was especially strong, with 6.5 million private-sector jobs created.

For additional context, it’s also worth looking at what percentage of the recession-related job losses were gained back during the first 23 months of the recovery.

By this measure, the Obama recovery has gained back 12.7 percent of the private-sector jobs lost during the recent recession (and 7.3 percent of all jobs lost in the recession). This is far better than the George W. Bush recovery -- which, as we noted actually produced job losses -- but when it comes to private-sector jobs, the current recovery has been weaker than the three earlier recoveries.

You get a similar assessment if you compare job creation statistics during the recovery to the size of the labor force. The total job gain over the first 23 months of the current recovery amounts to about one-third of 1 percent of the size of the labor force at the start of the recovery. Once again, the George W. Bush recovery produced job losses, and the recovery from the Carter recession was also low, at two-hundredths of 1 percent.

But the recoveries from the Reagan recession (6.1 percent of the labor force) and the George H.W. Bush recession (1.1 percent) were significantly stronger than the current recovery.

Where does this leave us? Goolsbee’s facts are correct -- job creation during the past 15 months far exceeds the job creation seen in the previous recovery. He compared the current recovery only to the prior one, which was easily the weakest in recent U.S. history. But while this is somewhat misleading, Goolsbee was careful to make a very specific claim. More worrisome is that he used cherry picking to help make his point. He ignored the first eight months of the current recovery, in which a significant number of jobs were lost. On balance, we rate Goolsbee's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC918EC0>],/factchecks/2011/jun/06/austan-goolsbee/austan-goolsbee-says-current-recovery-beats-job-cr/

McCaskill's campaign says Hawley broke his promise but public corruption team exists
","Editor's note, Dec. 7, 2017: The Missouri Democratic Party asked us to take another look at the evidence after this fact check ran in November. The party’s spokeswoman provided us with examples of other units that Josh Hawley created with dedicated staffs. She argued again that the attorney general’s reference to a public corruption ""team,"" rather than ""unit,"" showed Hawley had not fulfilled his promise. We have added those examples, as well as more information from Hawley’s camp. After further review, our rating remains the same. *** Democrats have accused Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley of breaking more than one promise. Now, incumbent Sen. Claire McCaskill’s campaign says he has broken another. McCaskill campaign manager David Kirby released a statement in response to Hawley’s announcement for Senate, addressing a vow to prosecute public corruption. ""He broke his promise to create a Public Corruption Unit to crack down on the pay-to-play culture of Jefferson City,"" Kirby said. You can see the full statement below. But Hawley’s office says he has kept that promise. Who’s telling the truth? Let’s find out. Hawley’s campaign During his attorney general campaign, Hawley promised to create a public corruption unit that would ""take a more aggressive role in aiding local and federal prosecutors investigating allegations of corruption."" On the attorney general’s website, Hawley says he’s fulfilled his promise. The page defines the group as a team that ""actively investigates and prosecutes official abuses of power and other corruption to keep Missouri government honest and clean."" Hawley also referred to problems with ""pay-to-play culture"" in Jefferson City on the campaign trail. Pay-to-play is usually defined as money in exchange for services. What Democrats say When we reached out to McCaskill’s campaign for evidence, it pointed us to the Missouri Democratic Party. The party sent us language it said was from Hawley’s campaign website that specifically promised to use the public corruption unit to end pay-to-play in Jefferson City. ""In addition to a public corruption unit, my ethics reform plan would prevent public officials from getting rich off the system, increase transparency, attack the pay-to-play politics of Jefferson City and ban lobbyist gifts to employees within the A.G.’s office — a ban that should be extended to the Missouri Legislature."" We couldn’t verify that ourselves because that passage no longer exists on Hawley’s website, but the party also pointed us to a quote from a debate Hawley did on 93.9, the Eagle. ""I have a plan to clean it up. I've announced that I would create a public corruption unit in the office of the Attorney General to coordinate local law enforcement, federal law enforcement, to prosecute, investigate and prosecute these public corruption crimes that have come to characterize Jefferson City and it's time that we took these measures,"" he said on May 17, 2016. Team vs. Unit Hawley’s website says he has a public corruption ""team,"" not a ""unit."" Meira Bernstein, a party spokeswoman, pointed us to six other units in Hawley’s office that have dedicated staff. They are the Federalism Unit, the Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, and four units in the Public Safety Division. ""There is absolutely no reason he would call the Public Corruption Team a ‘team’ rather than a ‘unit,’ other than the fact that it is different than a unit,"" Bernstein said. Here’s where we have to go back to the original promise. Hawley did not promise to create a public corruption unit ""with dedicated staff."" He promised to create a public corruption unit to ""take a more aggressive role in aiding local and federal prosecutors investigating allegations of corruption."" Whether he calls it a team or a unit, Hawley’s office provided substantial evidence proving he has done that. When asked about the team versus unit argument, Hawley’s deputy chief of staff Loree Anne Paradise said, ""When you look up the word ‘team’ on Thesaurus.com, ‘unit’ is listed as a synonym."" Does it matter? Though Hawley made some indications he would use the group to address pay-to-play in Jefferson City, it doesn’t necessarily prove what Democrats are claiming. Why? Because a public corruption team exists. The group is led by Deputy Attorney General Darrell Moore. Other lawyers working on the team include First Assistant John Sauer and Deputy Attorney General Michael Martinich-Sauter. Paradise said attorneys within the Public Safety Division also provide support, such as Greg Goodwin, Travis Lilly, Steven Kretzer and Locke Thompson. At the time of Kirby’s statement, the website page listed three cases the team has worked on. It now lists four cases, with the most recent press release dated December 1, 2017. Paradise said there are several other ongoing investigations that are not yet public. Hawley’s office said they find these public corruption cases in three primary ways. They receive tips from government officials and law enforcement, find cases themselves by actively looking for them and receive complaints issued by the Missouri Office of Constituent Services. After identifying a public corruption case, Hawley’s office said the investigation process requires complex analysis by a number of attorneys (depending on the case) and takes at least a couple of months. Democrats say the group didn’t exist until the Missouri Democratic Party started asking questions. Bernstein said the party made a Sunshine Request on July 12 for any emails regarding a public corruption unit. The next day, according to the Democratic Party’s timeline, Hawley sent a request that a page be created on his official website. Paradise did not specify when the webpage was created but said the team was in play months before Democrats’ accusations. The news release for the first case is dated April 5, 2017. The corruption team has prosecuted officials in Mississippi, Cooper and Cass counties. No state legislators or other Jefferson City officials have been prosecuted. Our ruling McCaskill’s campaign manager said Hawley ""broke his promise to create a Public Corruption Unit to crack down on the pay-to-play culture of Jefferson City."" Although Democrats contest when it was born and say he hasn’t used the team to crack down on ""pay-to-play"" in Jefferson City, the bottom lineis Hawley has prioritized prosecuting public corruption and created a team to make it happen. Regardless of whether the group is a team or unit, Hawley’s office still has a working group of lawyers who have already prosecuted four officials for public corruption. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC624900>],/factchecks/2017/nov/24/claire-mccaskill/mccaskills-campaign-says-hawley-broke-his-promise-/
"['Transportation', 'Wisconsin', 'Wisconsin Department of Transportation']","
Are Wisconsin's driver licenses ""most secure in the nation""? Expert: Yes.
","When it comes to driver’s licenses and state-issued ID cards across the nation, one size fits all. The cards all follow what is known as the ID-1 format, which specifies a size of 85.60 × 53.98 mm ( 3 3⁄8 inch ×  2 1⁄8 inch) and rounded corners with a radius of 2.88–3.48 mm (roughly the same size as a bank card). But size is the only equalizer. Each state uses its own design, colors, data and text font. They also differ in their level of security. How secure are licenses in the Badger State? ""Wisconsin’s driver licenses and identification (ID) cards are currently the most secure in the nation,"" said Corey Kleist, Department of Motor Vehicles section chief, in a news release a while back. To be sure, all licenses and ID cards must be in compliance with federal standards established under the REAL ID Act of 2005. So, is the ""most-secure"" claim from the state Department of Transportation correct? Enhanced security The statement by Kleist came after the state DOT added what is known as the eNotify security feature to the system. It sends an email and/or text notification whenever certain activities happen, such as a request for a duplicate driver license or a change of address. If the license-holder doesn’t recognize the transaction, DMV staff can help to identify the origin of the transaction and offer guidance to help resolve any issues, according to the DOT. When asked to provide backup for the most-secure claim, DOT public affairs director Rebecca Kikkert noted the department has been making the ""most secure in the nation"" claim since switching to new cards in 2015. As part of the department's compliance with the REAL ID Act, all employees with access to key systems are fingerprinted and subject to federal background checks. Additionally, their work is subject to audits to determine whether applications are processed according to DMV procedures and state laws. Other changes included moving from having the cards printed at each DMV Customer Service Center, where they were laminated, to a centralized printing facility which uses a different technique -- polycarbonate cards. The new cards, made by CBN Secure Technologies, feature black-and-white laser-engraved photos and ultraviolet ink on intricate images of the Capitol and state flag. Other features include a raised signature, date of birth, expiration date, driver's license and ID numbers and U21 (under 21). Those pieces of information can be felt when holding the cards, which makes them harder to copy. The new cards are expected to be completely phased in by 2023, as old licenses expire. ""We were the first in the nation to deploy many of the security features our current cards carry; some of which have since been adopted by other states,"" said Kikkert. Brian Zimmer of Keeping IDentities Safe, an expert on security of ID cards, said Wisconsin was among the first 10 states determined to be REAL ID compliant. In the 10 years since, photo copying technology and photo-manipulation tools have become more sophisticated. So the bar for prevent counterfeiting of driver’s licenses has gotten much higher. ""Wisconsin DMV officials aimed at exceeding that bar in designing the current driver’s license, benchmarking the most recent designs and security features of other states, and coming up with superior card stock composition and advanced security features,"" Zimmer said. ""At this date, it is the most advanced among those issued in the United States."" He also gave Wisconsin high marks for adding the eNotify feature, calling it ""a very useful identity theft prevention service."" Keeping IDentities Safe, according to its website, is a non-partisan, not for profit crime prevention and education organization based in Washington, D.C. Its primary purpose is to raise public awareness about the importance of ID security. Our rating A DMV official said  ""Wisconsin's drivers licenses and identification (ID) cards are currently the most secure in the nation.""

Former NC Gov. says state hasn't really repealed controversial bathroom bill
","It might seem like House Bill 2 – the controversial law that regulated transgender bathroom access – has been repealed and tossed into the annals of North Carolina’s political history. A new law, House Bill 142, was passed. The NCAA ended its boycott of the state. The NBA, which last year relocated its All-Star game from Charlotte to New Orleans upon passage of HB2, plans to hold the game in Charlotte in 2019. And protests that occurred in front of the governor’s mansion in Raleigh when former Gov. Pat McCrory was in office have dissipated. All this, McCrory contended in a recent interview with WBT radio in Charlotte, has happened despite the fact that HB2 ""was really never repealed,"" he says. HB2 is a touchy subject for McCrory, who faced immediate backlash from corporations, advocacy groups and sports organizations after signing it into law in spring 2016. Democrat Roy Cooper beat McCrory, a Republican, last November in a tight race where Cooper campaigned on the idea that state leaders should focus less on social issues and more on teacher pay and health care. McCrory told WBT that the media are biased because they haven’t reported that ""all of the restrictions that were in place last October are in place this October."" ""Nothing's changed, but it is one of the best kept secrets in the media and in politics,"" McCrory said. ""Everyone's pretending the problem's solved and we're going to move on,"" he continued. ""It was a fake issue in many ways all along, and this is one issue where it's fake news that a bill was signed and very little changed except for the public perception."" This is one subject where McCrory and some of his former adversaries in LGBT advocacy groups basically agree. Ben Graumann, communications director for Equality NC, referred to new law HB 142 as ""a continuation of HB2."" And Chris Sgro, communications director for the Human Rights Campaign, said HB 142 ""while purported to be a 'repeal' of  HB2, simply replaces one discriminatory anti-transgender bill with another."" So we wondered if McCrory was on to something. What didn’t change HB2 required people in schools and other government buildings to use the bathroom that corresponded with their birth certificate. The law also banned local governments from passing local laws that protect LGBT people from discrimination within their boundaries, and prevented governments from making local rules raising the minimum wage, requiring paid leave policies and more. Republicans had contended that HB2 protected safety and privacy in bathrooms by overriding a Charlotte ordinance that had allowed transgender people to use bathrooms matching their gender identity. On March 30, the legislature approved and Cooper signed HB 142, which removed HB2’s name from the books. The new law received bipartisan support in the legislature but harsh criticism from conservative Christian groups that said it endangered women and equal rights groups that said the bill didn’t go far enough. HB 142 repealed just one of four HB2 sections. The other three sections re-established modified versions of some of the most controversial parts of HB2. As PolitiFact’s promise-tracking Coop-O-Meter points out, HB 142 added back HB2's bans on local anti-discrimination ordinances, but gave them an expiration date: Dec. 1, 2020, after the next gubernatorial election. The new law left regulation of bathrooms, showers and changing facilities to state lawmakers, not the local school systems, universities, community colleges and other state agencies that had been setting their own policies. But, since the state steered clear of creating new regulations, the new bill creates ""widespread uncertainty about whether and where transgender people can use restrooms in government buildings,"" said Chris Brook, legal director for the ACLU of North Carolina. ""Asking if House Bill 2 is repealed doesn’t tell the whole story,"" Brook said. ""The more important question is, does North Carolina law continue to discriminate against LGBT people and transgender people in particular? And the answer is yes."" What changed The most controversial part of HB2, and the part that drew the most national attention, was the requirement that people in government facilities use the bathroom matching their birth certificate. The cornerstone of HB 142 was the elimination of that requirement. Rather than allow transgender people to use the bathroom matching their gender identity, North Carolina rejoined 48 other states that have no explicit law about bathroom access for transgender people. One state, Washington, has gone the other direction and explicitly allowed allowed transgender people to use the bathroom of the gender with which they identify. In a statement explaining its willingness to resume placing events in North Carolina, the NCAA said: ""We have been assured by the state that this new law allows the NCAA to enact its inclusive policies by contract with communities, universities, arenas, hotels, and other service providers that are doing business with us, our students, other participants, and fans. Further, outside of bathroom facilities, the new law allows our campuses to maintain their own policies against discrimination, including protecting LGBTQ rights, and allows cities’ existing nondiscrimination ordinances, including LBGTQ protections, to remain effective."" The new law dissolved a ban on cities and counties imposing anti-discrimination ordinances on their contractors. Norma Houston, a lecturer for the UNC School of Government, described the changes in a post on the Coates’ Canons blog. Can a city or county require a contractor to have an anti-discrimination policy relating to the contractor’s suppliers or subcontractors that includes nondiscrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, transgender, or gender identity? Pre-HB2: Yes HB2: No Post-HB2: Yes On Oct. 18, Cooper signed an executive order that aims to prohibit discrimination (on the basis of race, gender, National Guard or veteran status, sexual orientation or gender identity) in government agencies and by state contractors. ""Governor Cooper said when he signed HB 142 that it represented a first step and he will continue to work to provide non-discrimination protections for all North Carolinians,"" Cooper’s spokesman, Ford Porter, wrote.   Along with Josh Stein, the N.C. attorney general, Cooper also announced a proposed settlement that if approved by a judge would allow transgender people in North Carolina facilities run by the Cooper administration to use public restrooms and other facilities that match their gender identity. ""By taking these steps, North Carolina is sending a clear message to the world that we are a welcoming state that is open for business,"" he said. ""Claiming that no progress has been made is completely and objectively false."" The proposed settlement, known as a consent decree, was proposed and agreed upon by Cooper and challengers of the lawsuit ""because of the significant constitutional harms H.B.142 has caused transgender North Carolinians,"" the ACLU said in an email. ""If entered, the consent decree would alleviate some of the sweeping harms that vulnerable transgender North Carolinians suffered from the H.B. 2 and H.B. 142 saga."" It’s unclear whether the judge will approve the settlement. Our ruling McCrory said HB2 ""was really never repealed."" The bill named HB2 was indeed trashed and the most controversial part of it is gone. Advocates point out that parts of the repeal bill are still restrictive. But it’s incorrect to suggest, as McCrory did, that ""nothing’s changed.""

Did House committee bar Democratic witnesses on GOP tax bill?
","Critics of the House Republicans’ tax bill have not only gone after its substance, but its process. During a markup of the bill by the House Ways and Means Committee, one Democratic committee member -- Rep. John Larson of Connecticut -- gave a stemwinder of an indictment that gained some currency on social media. Comparing the House consideration of the current Republican tax bill unfavorably with the process that led to the landmark 1986 tax bill, Larson said that ""no one was allowed to come forward. ... No one from the administration will even sit in front of us. We are the oldest committee in Congress, many would argue the most prestigious, and members on this side of the aisle aren't even entitled to bring an expert witness on any aspect of the tax code that affects 100 percent of our economy."" When we took a closer look, we found that both parties have valid arguments to air. Rep. John Larson, D-Conn., speaking at a House Ways and Means Committee markup of the Republican tax bill.   Republicans argue that the committee has addressed many of the issues in the bills in previous hearings this year, all of which included opportunities for the minority to call one witness. (For Ways and Means hearings, the majority typically picks a few witnesses and the minority chooses one; sometimes the majority and minority agree to jointly appoint a witness.) Here are four Ways and Means hearings from 2017 that addressed issues at stake in the tax bill, along with the minority’s choice of witness: • May 18, 2017: Subcommittee hearing on ""How Tax Reform Will Grow Our Economy and Create Jobs."" Minority witness: Steven Rattner, former leader of the Obama administration’s effort to revive the automobile industry. • May 23, 2017: Full committee hearing on ""Increasing U.S Competitiveness and Preventing American Jobs from Moving Overseas."" Minority witness: Kimberly Clausing, professor of economics at Reed College. • July 13, 2017: Subcommittee hearing on ""How Tax Reform Will Help America’s Small Businesses Grow and Create New Jobs."" Minority witness: Chye-Ching Huang, deputy director for federal tax policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. • July 19, 2017: Subcommittee hearing on ""How Tax Reform Will Simplify Our Broken Tax Code and Help Individuals and Families."" Minority witness: Eric Rodriguez, vice president at UnidosUS, a Hispanic research and advocacy group formerly known as National Council of La Raza. Donald Wolfensberger, a former Republican staffer on the House Rules Committee who now studies Congress at the Woodrow Wilson Center, said it would be typical for committees and subcommittees to debate bills and ideas with witnesses, and then hold a markup -- at which point new witnesses would not typically testify. In addition, it’s worth noting -- as the video of Larson makes clear -- there was one witness present at the markup, Thomas Barthold, the chief of staff of the Joint Tax Committee, the nonpartisan panel that does independent analysis of tax bills under consideration. The committee’s staff director is almost always invited to weigh in before Ways and Means when considering a bill the committee has analyzed. Wolfensberger said that, based on his own limited viewing of the markup in question, Barthold may have been a more effective witness for Democrats than they could have invited. ""The Democrats were certainly aiming a fair amount of tough questions at him, which he seemed to be answering in a very professional and knowledgeable manner,"" Wolfensberger said. ""I suspect they got more truthful and informative responses from him than they would have from partisan economists invited by both sides to put their best faces on the Democratic or GOP policy positions."" That said, Larson also has some reasonable points to make. Daniel Rubin, a spokesman for the Ways and Means Committee’s Democratic staff, said that the earlier hearings had addressed theoretical possibilities for the tax bill, not the elements that made it into the bill the committee marked up. The bill that was ultimately considered was ""much different than any of the outlines they had floating around earlier in the year,"" Rubin said. ""Democrats, including Mr. Larson, I presume, are frustrated that we never had a hearing with expert witnesses on how a repeal of the (state and local tax) deduction affects local economies, or how capping the mortgage interest deduction would hurt local housing markets, or … how $1.7 trillion in deficit spending might or might not drag down the economy."" Clausing, the Reed College professor who served as a witness for the minority, agreed. She said she testified ""based on the prior legislative proposals, focusing in particular on the border tax, which is not part of this legislation."" In general, she said, the process for the GOP bill has been ""way too quick for changes of this magnitude. No prior tax major tax bill has been done in such a rushed manner, with so little time for deliberation and understanding."" For instance, the official version of the bill was introduced on a Thursday, with markup beginning the following Monday. ""This was not as egregious as, say, the Senate's handling of the health bill, which ignored the core committees entirely, but it was a real and major deviation from what we think of as the regular order,"" said Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Richard E. Cohen, a congressional reporter and author of a biography of the late Ways and Means chairman Dan Rostenkowski, said that both sides have raised fair points. ""No doubt, the hearings were an opportunity to explore multiple aspects of the tax code, and it appears that Democrats had an opportunity to invite their own expert witnesses,"" Cohen said. ""It's also true that those hearings were months ago before many details of the current legislation had been filed, and that the current legislation was pushed through the House on an unusually expedited schedule with minimal bipartisanship."" Larson said that Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee weren’t ""even entitled to bring an expert witness on any aspect of the tax code that affects 100 percent of our economy."" Committee Democrats did have an opportunity to invite witnesses to a series of earlier hearings on issues related to the tax bill. However, those hearings were held before the official version of the bill was unveiled, and the final bill included a variety of provisions that were not discussed in those prior hearings.

Claim on Georgia child care picks its numbers to make case
","While announcing her child care plan, Georgia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams claimed that the average cost of childcare in Georgia is more than the average in-state tuition. The claim first appeared on Nov.15 in a Tweet promoting ""The Bold Action for a Bright Future Plan"". ""The average cost for infant care in GA is almost $7,700/yr – more than average in-state college tuition,"" read the post. The Abrams campaign pulled this information from the Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank that researches economic trends. The EPI's data says that in Georgia, infant care costs an average of $7,644 a year, 15.6 percent more than the state’s annual average in-state tuition.   The EPI’s estimated infant costs come from Child Care Aware of America’s 2015 ""Parents and the High Cost of Child Care"" report. The report calculates the averages of two types of infant care, care offered at a facility and care offered at someone’s home.The $7,644 used by the EPI is the more expensive type of infant care, care offered at a facility. According to the report, the average cost of childcare provided in a caregiver’s home in Georgia is $5,980 a year. According to EPI, Georgia's average in-state tuition estimate was taken from a 2014 survey conducted by the National Center of Education Statistics, a division of the U.S. Education Department. The total cost of tuition and required fees in a public university in Georgia averages out to $6,614 a year. So Abrams' number is accurate if the comparison is between child care at a facility and in-state college tuition. But it’s not correct if the comparison is with child care provided in a home. Abrams is not the first, and possibly not the last politician to make this type of comparison. Back in 2014, PolitiFact checked President Barack Obama's claim that in 31 states ""decent"" childcare cost more than college tuition. Back then, Obama also used Child Care Aware of America as a source. We rated his claim as Mostly True. Abrams tweeted, ""The average cost for infant care in GA is almost $7,700/yr – more than average in-state college tuition."" Abrams is correct if the comparison is between child care at a facility and college tuition, at $7,644 vs. $6,614. But child care offered in someone’s home -- at $5,980 -- is less that in-state college tuition. The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important facts.

The House tax bill contains language about unborn children, but is it an attempt to ban abortion?
","On the morning of Nov. 15, 2017, readers who clicked on the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s home page were confronted by a large pop-up ad attacking U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan that linked a Republican tax reform proposal to abortion:  The ad was from NARAL Pro-Choice America, formerly the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League. If you clicked on an image at the bottom that said ""Call Rep. Ryan Now,"" a link sent you to a page with more information. That page contained a statement that began with this: House Republicans are quickly moving to pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan. This is another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights. Leading the charge has been House Speaker Paul Ryan. NARAL made similar claims on social media. And the group said that, besides Ryan, the online ads targeted eight other House Republicans: Rod Blum of Iowa, Steve Knight and Darrell Issa of California, Erik Paulsen of Minnesota, Mike Coffman of Colorado, Barbara Comstock of Virginia, Karen Handel of Georgia and Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania. Let’s look at each of the three parts of the attack on Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican. 1. ‘Ryan is leading the effort’ The House tax bill was introduced on Nov. 2, 2017, and was approved by the House on Nov. 16, 2017, the day after NARAL’s ad on JSOnline.com. Ryan has long been touting a GOP tax reform proposal, describing it as the first major tax reform since 1986, and promising that its tax cuts and other tax changes would stimulate the economy. A spokeswoman in the speaker’s office told us Ryan supports the provision that is targeted by NARAL, which would change so-called 529 college savings accounts. But she said she wasn’t aware of any public statement Ryan has made on that provision, and we couldn’t find any, which indicates Ryan hasn’t taken the lead on pushing that particular provision. So, this part of the claim is partially accurate. 2. ‘Conception language disguised as savings plan’ People use 529 accounts (529 refers to that section of the tax code) as investment vehicles to save money for college expenses. The savings are for -- as the Internal Revenue Service explains it -- ""a designated beneficiary, such as a child or grandchild."" A key attraction is that earnings on investments are not subject to federal tax. The House tax bill would allow 529 accounts to be opened explicitly for unborn children. That provision says: Nothing shall prevent an unborn child from being treated as a designated beneficiary or an individual under this section. The term ""unborn child"" means a child in utero. The term ""child in utero"" means a member of the species homo sapiens, at any stage of development, who is carried in the womb. The provision is ""disguised"" in the sense that adding the unborn child language doesn’t enable savers to do anything they can’t already do for future children -- a point U.S. Rep. Judy Chu, D-Calif., raised during a hearing. Expectant parents and other savers can already open a 529 in anyone’s name, including their own, and later change the beneficiary -- for instance, after a child is born. Meanwhile, it’s clear the provision is divisive. NARAL is among a number of groups that opposes it; meanwhile, anti-abortion groups support the provision, with one, the Susan B. Anthony List, saying: ""It's a small increment in the momentum that we're building to ensure that one day every child is welcomed and protected under the law."" So, this part of the claim is mostly on target. 3. ‘Another attempt to ban abortion’ The third part of the claim, however, goes too far. The 529 provision would not ban abortion; it strictly deals with college savings accounts, not any restrictions on abortion. In fact, in announcing its ads, NARAL itself labeled the provision as merely a beginning step, saying: The sole purpose of this provision is to codify the radical, anti-choice idea that life begins at conception into law and begin the process of banning abortion altogether ….This is the first time ‘personhood’ language has made it into tax reform legislation, leaving the door open for future laws to use the same, ideological definition of when life begins … There is evidence that, as the New York Times reported, ""the provision accomplishes what anti-abortion activists have long sought: It enshrines into federal law the recognition of the unborn."" The anti-abortion group March for Life said in a statement: ""We are heartened to see this bill promote the personhood of an unborn child … and see this as a huge stride toward expanding the child tax credit to recognize life beginning at conception."" Snopes fact checked whether the tax provision attempts to codify ""fetal personhood"" — the legal theory that a fetus has the same legal rights as a person -- and found the claim largely accurate. Two experts, echoing others, told us that inserting an unborn child definition into federal law is part of a broader strategy to limit abortion rights in the future. ""It is part of the anti-abortion strategy to work on all fronts to establish fetal personhood/citizenship claims,"" said Yale Law School professor Mindy Roseman, whose specialties include reproduction rights.   The ""unborn child"" or human ""from moment of conception"" language is also in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services’ strategic plan, said University of Wisconsin-Madison law and bioethics professor Alta Charo, whose specialties include reproductive health. Such efforts are aimed, she said, ""at building an impression that everywhere in federal law the embryo and fetus is considered morally and perhaps legally equal to a live-born child. It is like building a wall. At the end, abortion stands out as a singular exception, a single missing brick in the wall, and seems harder and harder to justify either morally or constitutionally."" Ryan’s response Asked to respond to NARAL’s ad, Ryan’s office referred us to a statement about the provision issued by House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. The statement says in part: Today, our tax code doesn’t recognize children with eyes, ears, noses, arms, legs, fingers, and heartbeats as children just because they haven’t yet left the womb ….So our tax plan adds clear language that allows parents to start a college savings account before their son or daughter is born by explicitly and unambiguously declaring these sons and daughters ""unborn children."" Our ruling NARAL says Ryan is leading the effort to ""pass a tax bill with divisive conception language by disguising it as a college savings plan"" in ""another attempt to ban abortion and rob women of their reproductive rights."" Ryan is leading the effort to pass the tax bill. But while he supports the college savings plan provision, he hasn’t spoken out publicly to push that provision. Conception language in the provision is divisive among anti-abortion and abortion-rights groups. And it is ‘disguised’ in the sense that it inserts the concept of unborn children into federal law without making any material change to what are known as 529 college savings plans. The provision would not, however, ban or even restrict abortion rights -- although advocates fear that inserting unborn children language into federal law could be used to erode abortion rights in the future. NARAL’s statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details -- our definition of Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC74AC00>],/factchecks/2017/nov/22/naral-pro-choice/house-tax-bill-contains-language-about-unborn-chil/

Fake news: Civil war erupts in Sweden
","The Swedes are fed up with the ""Muslim invasion"" in their country and have fought back with fire, according to a news account on Facebook. ""Civil war erupts in Sweden as irate Swedes burn nine Muslim refugee centers to the ground,"" states the headline in Pipo News, which linked to a similar 2015 article in JewsNews, a fake news website. We found no contact information on the Pipo News website. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story and the photo are misleading. However, Muslim refugees have been the targets of suspected arson attacks in Sweden in recent years. Pipo News states that the multiple arsons have been at facilities that house or are slated to house immigrants. But the photo is actually a of a fire of a recycling station in Malmo Sweden in 2013, our fact-checking friends at Snopes noted in 2015. Pipo News cites arson incidents at a children’s summer camp in the Swedish town of Eskilstuna that planned to host asylum seekers and in a refugee center in the town of Munkedal. Fires did occur in those two towns, according to credible news articles. On Christmas Day in 2014, five people were injured in a fire in a mosque in Eskilstuna, near Stockholm, which the authorities also suspect may have been arson, the New York Times reported. (Nothing in the New York Times stated that the site was a children’s camp.) Reuters reported in November 2015 that in the town of Munkedal, a center housing 14 asylum seekers went up in flames. ""The Munkedal blaze was just one of more than a dozen at centers across Sweden in the past month -- some confirmed as arson attacks and others suspected as such -- that the police are struggling to solve as the country expects to take in up to a record 190,000 asylum seekers this year,"" Reuters reported. The fires occurred while a far-right anti-immigrant party, the Sweden Democrats, was gaining more traction, the New York Times wrote in 2015. Sweden had previously been known as a welcoming country for refugees, but that philosophy was tested as an influx of refugees strained government services. Omar Mustafa, president of the Islamic Association of Sweden, told the New York Times in January 2015 that the fires at mosques followed a year of rising anti-Islamic attacks which included vandalism of mosques. ''It is a scary development in Swedish society,'' Mustafa said. ''It is a big movement that is moving from the Internet to the real world.'' Suspected arson incidents have continued in 2017 at Sweden's largest Shiite Muslim mosque and a mosque near Stockholm. While the Pipo News article gives the impression that Muslim immigration has led to civil war, Reuters reported in 2015 that opinion polls showed most Swedes supported welcoming refugees. Pew Research Center surveyed European views of refugees in 2016 and found that in Sweden 57 percent were concerned that refugees would increase terrorism in their country, slightly above the median among the 10 countries surveyed. But of the 10 countries, Sweden had the lowest percentage that viewed refugees from Syria and Iraq as a major threat. Pipo News’ headline states ""civil war erupts in Sweden as irate Swedes burn nine Muslim refugee centers to the ground."" The story uses a misleading photo of an unrelated fire and portrays the situation in Sweden as a war, which is a gross exaggeration. There have been multiple fires at Muslim sites, but there is no evidence that a civil war has erupted as nine Muslim refugee centers burned to the ground.

Misleading headline says 412 Michigan Muslims busted
","Hundreds of Muslim doctors in Detroit were arrested by the federal government in a record-breaking bust, stated an article on Facebook. ""The largest bust in U.S. history: 412 Muslims arrested from Michigan,"" stated a headline we saw in November on Fresh Media News. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. While the headline is fake, because it describes all of the suspects as Muslims from Michigan without evidence, a key element of the story is based on real events: The federal government did charge 412 people nationwide in a health care bust in July. Fresh Media News calls itself a website that provides ""daily updates of the hidden things."" We found no disclaimer or contact information on the website and sent a message via Facebook and did not get a reply. Similar articles ran on other websites in July. The article portrays Michigan Muslims as rampant criminals. ""The state of Michigan is clearly turning into a Sharia swamp, thanks to the reckless immigration policies of Obama over the last 8 years,"" stated the article. Fresh Media News claims that federal officials made a bust in a $1.3 billion fraudulent scheme involving Medicare fraud, ripping off insurance companies and prescribing opioids. Some of the basic details are muddled -- the headline says the 412 suspects were from Michigan while part of the article says officials arrested 412 people nationwide. Here is what actually happened: On July 13, U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the ""largest health care fraud takedown operation in American history."" Federal authorities charged 412 defendants across about two dozen states, including doctors, nurses and other licensed medical professionals, for their alleged participation in health care fraud schemes involving approximately $1.3 billion in false billings. Thirty-two of the defendants were from the Eastern District of Michigan. Fresh Media News cited some accurate details in the case, including that the FBI raided medical offices in Detroit’s historic Fisher building and named one of the actual Michigan defendants: Mashiyat Rashid. Prosecutors allege that Rashid ran a conspiracy starting in 2008 that involved six other defendants and various companies in which they recruited homeless people as patients and sent phony bills to Medicare, according to The Detroit News. The Detroit News described Rashid as a ""Muslim businessman, who moved to the United States from Bangladesh and is a U.S. citizen."" While Fresh Media News wrote without evidence that the 412 suspects were Muslims, nothing in the federal documents we reviewed, including Sessions’ remarks, mentioned the religion of the defendant. We contacted Sessions’ press office and did not get a reply. It’s not surprising that a fake news story would target Muslims in Michigan. The Muslim population has been growing in Michigan for decades and is now about 2.75 percent of the state’s population as of 2015, according to a report by Muslims for American Progress, a project by the Institute for Policy Studies and Social Understanding that aims to educate the public about Muslims. (A Pew study estimates that Muslims comprise about 1 percent of the U.S.) Michigan Muslims comprise more than 15 percent of the state’s medical doctors and more than 10 percent of the state’s pharmacists. Fresh Media News wrote in a headline "" ‘The largest bust in U.S. history’ 412 Muslims arrested in Michigan!"" The federal government announced the bust of 412 people in a health care fraud scheme in July, but the suspects were from across the nation. We found no evidence that all the suspects are Muslims.

Florida Gov. Rick Scott says he's cut taxes 75 times, creating 1.3 million jobs. Did he?
","For years, Republican Gov. Rick Scott has touted an ever-growing pile of tax cuts he has achieved for the state. In 2013, he claimed he cut taxes 24 times. In 2014, that number grew to 40. Now, as Scott rounds out his last full year in office (and ponders a run for the U.S. Senate), the tally has been raised once more. ""We’ve cut taxes 75 times, cut $7.5 billion worth in taxes, and as a result we’ve added over 1.3 million jobs,"" Scott said Nov. 9 during a news conference in Tampa. Scott's past boasts rated Half True, because Scott relied on some creative math to reach his tax cut total. He did that again in this claim, but he went even further when he said those tax cuts resulted in the creation of 1.3 million jobs. Experts say the cuts may be a factor in job growth, but they're likely not the most critical one. ""The governor takes credit for all the jobs created since he took office, but with so many other driving factors at play, it's difficult to attribute these jobs to the tax cuts,"" said Joe Pennisi with the Florida Policy Institute. Scott’s team sent PolitiFact Florida a list of 82 ""tax cuts"" that reduced government revenues by a combined $7.7 billion. (You can see the list from 2011-16 here; the 2017 list is here.) As in times past, the list counts Florida's mostly annual sales tax holiday, includes reductions in fees such as lowering the cost to obtain a concealed weapons permit, and counts a measure that stopped an automatic fee increase to obtain a hunting or fishing license. Many of the measures are extremely targeted and many only affect businesses. However, they do reduce state government revenue, which is why Scott broadly defines them as a tax cut, even if they aren't. Asked to back up the governor's statement, his office sent us a more nuanced statement about how the tax cuts ""helped"" contribute to positive economic growth — it did not as directly link the cuts to jobs. ""As the governor has said for the past seven years, cutting taxes has helped turn around Florida’s economy, made our state more business-friendly, and has allowed job creators to invest more in creating new opportunities — all of which has helped Florida businesses create more than 1.3 million new jobs,"" said Scott spokeswoman Kerri Wyland. We organized the list into four broad categories: targeted breaks (21 items), sales tax reductions or exemptions (25), breaks for businesses (17), and fee reductions (12). The largest chunk of tax cuts reduce the amount of taxes collected on a very specific good, service or industry. Examples include tax exemptions for first responders and surviving spouses, eliminating the sales taxes on repairs to planes between 2,000 and 15,000 pounds, and increasing financial assistance for businesses to donate to community development and housing projects for low-income residents. Also counted is a renewable energy tax exemption that exempts 80 percent of the value of a renewable energy source from tangible personal property tax for all applicants, residential and nonresidential. One thing to remember about sales tax exemptions and reductions: You have to consume the goods to get the break — and most offered temporary relief. The tax cut package from 2014 included several exemptions, including a temporary cut for the purchase of cement mixing drums for cement trucks. Scott’s list also counts about $20 million worth of sales tax exemptions for child car seats and youth bike helmets, prescribed diet pet food, and prepaid college meal plans. These last until the end of 2017. The agriculture industry has also seen sales tax breaks, such as the 2015 exemption that was extended for trailers and irrigation equipment related to production. The manufacturing industry also got a permanent exemption on mechanical equipment. Exemptions in 2017 include health products for livestock poultry and aquaculture, construction building materials, feminine hygiene products and medical marijuana delivery devices. Scott counted the mostly annual tax-free shopping holiday around seven different times since 2017. From 2011-17 there was a tax-free holiday in the month of August for shoes, clothing and school supply purchases. It also exempted sales taxes on laptops and tablets, up to $750 in four of the years. Most of the holidays were three days, but in 2015, there was a 10-day period for the break. The state has offered the holiday since 1998 except in 2002, 2003, 2008, 2009. Kurt Wenner, Florida TaxWatch vice president of research, pointed out that several tax cuts on Scott’s list aim to build a more competitive business climate, such as the permanent sales tax exemption for manufacturing equipment. He said targeting capital expenses, particularly in industries with high wages, stimulates the economy. Scott and the Legislature have worked to expand tax credits for businesses for areas such as research and development; cleaning up contaminated sites known as brownfields; and increasing the amount of money available for credits under a ""new market"" program. Per Scott’s wishes, the Legislature expanded the exemption for corporate income taxes from $5,000 to $25,000 in 2011, and again in 2012 to $50,000, sparing thousands of businesses from paying the tax. The hit to the state budget for both is about $30 million a year. Another notable example in this section came in the most recent legislative session when lawmakers pared the sales tax on the total rent paid for any commercial property from 6 percent to 5.8 percent, a loss of $25 million in tax revenue in 2017. The Legislature has targeted fees for specific licenses during Scott’s tenure. Lawmakers blocked an automatic inflation adjustment for hunting and fishing license fees costing the state almost $20 million from 2013-17. They also reduced the cost of licenses renewal for concealed weapons from $60 to $50, and then again in 2017 to $45. One significant fee reduction came in 2014 with SB 156, which rolled back motor vehicle registration fee increases, saving motorists about $25 a year per vehicle registration. No doubt, Scott has cut taxes in his seven years as governor. Our quibble is with the claim that he did it 75 times, which is an inflated statistic. His claim that those tax cuts created 1.3 million jobs, however, is on shakier ground. ""It’s hard to determine exactly how many jobs the tax cuts produced; however, it's economically expected that spending more is going to help the economy and in turn create jobs,"" Wenner said. Experts said a bulk of the tax cuts (especially the sales tax holidays and narrow sales tax exemptions) have a minimal effect on the economy. ""What causes businesses to hire more employees is demand for their services,"" said Jonathan Hamilton, an economic professor at the University of Florida. ""The (tax cuts) on Scott’s list all account for a relatively small reduction in their costs."" Pennisi pointed to research from left-leaning organizations that show tax cuts and business incentives fail to have a significant impact on economic activity and job creation. Businesses don’t necessarily use extra savings to hire more employees. ""Hiring is driven by the demand for a business’ goods and services rather than the presence in the owner’s pocket of a few more dollars made available through tax cuts,"" Pennisi said in a 2016 brief. He said the bulk of the governor’s tax cuts would not be expected to create that demand. Looking for more evidence Scott's tax cuts can't solely be the reason the state added 1.3 million jobs? In July 2010, before Scott was elected governor, state economists predicted that the national economic recovery would mean 1 million new jobs for Florida by 2017. That was before Scott was elected or ever cut a tax. Scott said, ""We’ve cut taxes 75 times, cut $7.5 billion worth in taxes, and as a result we’ve added over 1.3 million jobs."" Scott is including anything that reduces government revenues to claim he's cut taxes 75 times. But, as we've said before, the list includes things that are clearly not tax cuts. In addition, Scott is claiming those tax cuts have resulted in the creation of 1.3 million jobs. The fact is, state economists predicted Florida would add 1 million jobs in over the same time period before Scott was even elected governor and had an opportunity to enact his policies. Experts say tax cuts may be a reason the state has seen jobs rebound, but it's not the sole or even most important reason. Scott’s claim is partially accurate and overplays the connection to more than 1 million jobs. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB2BB80>],/factchecks/2017/nov/21/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-he-cut-taxes-75-times-created-13-m/

Moore's wife coins new anti-abortion term to attack his Democratic opponent
","As Alabama Republican Senate nominee Roy Moore wrestles with accounts of sexual encounters with underaged teens, his Democratic opponent faces political attacks about abortion. Doug Jones is unabashedly pro-abortion rights, and Moore’s wife Kayla spoke at a rally in Montgomery, Ala., about his position. Reading from a prepared statement, Moore called Jones ""an ultra-liberal."" ""Who was an Obama delegate,"" she said of Jones on Nov. 17. ""Who is for full-term abortion? Who is for more gun restrictions? Who is for transgender bathrooms? Who is for transgender in the military?"" The list continued, but we wanted to look at whether Jones is for full-term abortions. First of all, while the phrase ""late-term abortion"" is familiar, ""full-term abortion"" is not. We asked the Moore campaign what Kayla Moore meant. ""Kayla was referring to Doug's statement on Chuck Todd (on Meet the Press) where he refused to support an abortion ban after 20 weeks,"" said Hannah Ford, deputy campaign manager. We’ll take a look at that Meet the Press segment, as well as another interview Jones gave to Alabama newspapers when he talked about late-term abortion law. Regarding ""full-term abortion,"" Moore has used a phrase that virtually didn’t exist before she said it. Jones appeared on MSNBC’s Meet the Press in late September. Near the end, host Chuck Todd pressed him on abortion. Here’s the full exchange: Todd: ""What are the limitations that you believe should be in the law when it comes to an abortion?"" Jones: ""I am a firm believer that a woman should have the freedom to choose what happens to her own body. And I’m going to stand up for that, and I’m going to make sure that continues to happen. I want to make sure that as we go forward, people have access to contraception, they have access to the abortion that they might need, if that's what they choose to do. I think that’s an issue that we can work with and talk to people about on both sides of the aisle."" Todd: ""So you wouldn't be in favor of legislation that said, ban abortion after 20 weeks or something like that?"" Jones: ""I'm not in favor of anything that is going to infringe on a woman's right and her freedom to choose. That's just the position that I've had for many years. It's a position I continue to have. But I want people to understand that once that baby is born, I’m going to be there for that child. That’s where I become a right-to-lifer."" Jones added more detail to his position on abortion in a Nov. 2 interview with AL.com. ""I fully support a woman's freedom to choose to what happens to her own body,"" Jones said. ""Having said that, the law for decades has been that late-term procedures are generally restricted except in the case of medical necessity. That's what I support. I don't see any changes in that."" Jones had said largely the same thing in mid October in a statement released by the campaign. ""This is a deeply personal decision,"" the statement said. ""I support the current law on a woman’s freedom to choose, which has been in place for decades, where late-term abortions are permitted to protect the life or health of the mother."" While Jones spoke of late-term abortions, the phrase itself has no fixed legal definition. Broadly speaking, the term refers to a dividing line set at different points in different states. Before that point (20 weeks post-fertilization in Alabama, for example) a woman can have an abortion for any reason. After that point, she can have one only if her life is endangered or her physical health is severely compromised. So Jones has said he supports laws that allow abortions beyond a certain number of weeks in order to protect the health of the mother. The Moore campaign’s definition of what qualifies as a full-term abortion — meaning, abortions that occur after 20 weeks — does not match the medical definition. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a full-term pregnancy falls between 39 weeks of gestation to 40 weeks and six days. That span falls well beyond the 18 to 25 weeks set by state law that determine when abortion restrictions apply. From the earliest days when the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed abortion’s legality based on the rights of the mother, fetal viability has helped define the dividing line. But as medical knowledge has pushed back the time when a premature infant can survive, the breakpoint has changed. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists focuses on the period in which independent life outside the womb is at tipping point. In 2017, a panel of doctors determined that period ranges from as early as 20 weeks after fertilization to just under 26 weeks. In that span, ""outcomes range from certain or near-certain death to likely survival with a high likelihood of serious morbidities."" In common parlance, anything beyond 20 or 25 weeks is often referred to as a late-term abortion. So where does Moore’s use of full-term abortion fit? And Jones’ use of late-term? ""I have not heard the phrase ‘full-term abortion’ used in the debates over abortion, but neither have I heard the phrase ‘late-term’ abortion used without specifying gestational limits,"" said O. Carter Snead, associate professor of law at the University of Notre Dame. ""They are both speaking in more colloquial terms rather than using terms of art deployed in the legal and political debates."" That said, the use of the phrase late-term abortion empirically is far more common. A Nexis search for it between New Year’s Day 2017 and the day before Moore gave her speech produced 569 hits. The same search for full-term abortion produced one. It was in a letter to the editor that appeared in a Maine newspaper. Law professor I. Glenn Cohen at Harvard University said he hadn’t heard the term and found it ""puzzling."" Lisa Harris, a physician who studies abortion practice, law, policy and ethics at the University of Michigan Medical School, said "" ‘full-term abortion’ is not a term I have heard before, and doesn’t exist as a matter of routine practice."" ""If there's a reason someone needs to deliver early, then you induce labor, or you perform a C-section,"" she said. Harris said the only situation that might match Moore’s ""full-term abortion"" are rare cases of third trimester abortion. ""Third trimester abortions are incredibly infrequent,"" Harris said. ""My understanding is that these are difficult and unusual situations that generally involve a fetal anomaly that makes life untenable for the fetus."" At its roots, abortion law sorts out the moral rules during the time when the baby depends on the mother for survival. The idea of full-term abortion lies beyond that window of time. By definition, at full-term a baby without significant anomalies is able to survive outside the womb. Kayla Moore said Jones is for full-term abortion. The language of the abortion debate is imprecise, but the phrase ""full-term abortion"" had virtually no track-record before Moore said it. Jones said he supports laws that allow abortions after 20 weeks or so of gestation, commonly known as late-term abortions, to protect a mother’s life or health. He hasn’t addressed a situation that, in the view of a leading medical researcher, doesn’t exist in practice. Moore measured Jones against a term that is disconnected from reality.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Steve Mnuchin']","
Steve Mnuchin uses partial data to say GOP tax bill favors middle-income households
","Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin, one of the White House’s leading advocates for the Republican tax bills pending in the House and Senate, took to the Sunday-morning airwaves to promote the measures. On Fox News Sunday, host Chris Wallace cited an analysis by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation on the House version of the tax bill. ""They say it delivers 80 percent of its cuts to corporations, businesses, and wealthy families,"" Wallace said. Mnuchin responded, ""Chris, these numbers are very complicated, and it depends on how you allocate them. So one of the things they're doing is they're taking a pass-through allocation, which is all about small and medium-size businesses, and they're allocating it back to the wealthy. And the same thing with the corporate tax cuts. We don't believe that."" Instead, Mnuchin said, ""if you look at this simply, and people just look at, are their personal taxes going up or down, on the personal tax side, middle income people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts or, in certain cases, increases."" As it turns out, Mnuchin has a point that many middle-income Americans stand to benefit from the tax bills. However, his suggestion that ""rich people"" will somehow draw the short straw is questionable and based on a selective reading of the data. Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin appeared on ""Fox News Sunday"" on Nov. 19, 2017.   The White House pointed us to analysis by the Tax Foundation, an independent group that leans conservative. Two tables -- one each for the House and Senate -- show the impact the bills would have on taxpayers in a range of income levels. For the Senate bill, the Tax Foundation model found that every income group except one -- taxpayers between the 90th and 95th percentile in income -- would see an increase in after-tax income due to the bill. That would hold for both in 2018 and in 2027. And in terms of percentage increases, some of the highest would come for groups in the middle of the income distribution. The story is much the same for the House bill. A few more upper-income groups would see incomes fall after the House bill than after the Senate bill, but the general pattern would hold -- that is, as Mnuchin said, middle-income earners would fare the best. That’s not the whole story, though. Remember that Mnuchin framed his statistic as referring to ""the personal tax side."" The data from the Tax Foundation cited above comes purely from the personal tax side. But that’s a bit cherry-picked. The House and Senate bills would not only change personal income taxes; they would also change how other types of taxes are levied, including corporate and estate taxes. ""A big part of the bill is slashing taxes on business income, which disproportionately affects high-income earners, as does eventually repealing estate tax,"" said Len Burman, who co-founded the Tax Policy Center. Since these taxes are not factored into the personal-taxes-only data we cited above, this data underplays the positive impact the bill as a whole would have on wealthy households. Once you add in the business and estate taxes, the benefits of the bill become a lot less geared toward middle-income earners. In the Senate bill, the highest percentage increases in income would accrue to those in the top 20 percent (a 3.1 percent increase in 2018) and the top 1 percent (a 7.5 percent increase in 2018). Those two groups would also fare the best in 2027. In the House bill, the difference between middle-income and wealthier income groups is somewhat more muted, but the top 20 percent would still gain 3.6 percent in income in 2018 while the top 1 percent gained 7.5 percent that year. By 2027, the top 20 percent would gain 1.1 percent and the top 1 percent would gain 3.3 percent. The Tax Foundation report acknowledges this pattern, saying, ""Much of the increase in after-tax incomes for higher-income earnings is attributable to changes in business taxation, such as the lower corporate income tax rate and the lower pass-through business income tax rate."" (We also confirmed with the foundation that the estate tax is not factored into the tables reprinted above.) So, the very same report shows that the bill as a whole -- not just the personal tax changes -- is tilted a lot more heavily towards wealthier Americans than Mnuchin indicated. Other groups paint a similar picture. It’s worth emphasizing that these other analyses show that many Americans would indeed see a tax cut under the GOP bills. According to an analysis by the nonpartisan Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, in 2018, the 20 percent of households in the middle of the income spectrum -- known as the ""middle quintile"" -- would get, on average, $830 in savings, or about 1.4 percent of their income. That’s not nothing, though, contrary to what Mnuchin suggested, it’s smaller than the gains for richer Americans. The top 20 percent of households, the ""top quintile,"" would get a $4,860 tax cut in 2018, worth about 1.9 percent of their income. And the top 1 percent would save $37,100 in 2018, or 2.4 percent of their income. By 2027, the middle quintile would see its cut shrink to $360, or 0.5 percent of their income. For the top quintile, the cuts would stay roughly similar between 2018 and 2027-- $4,590, or 1.3 percent of their income. And for the top 1 percent, the tax savings would go up by 2027, reaching $62,300, or 2.6 percent of their income. We should note that not every taxpayer in those groups would see a cut. But in all the income ranges we cited, and in both years, a clear majority of taxpayers in that income group would see a decrease, according to the Tax Policy Center analysis. Another analysis, by the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, found that the $1-million-and-up income range saw an overall, cumulative cut in each of the years studied. Mnuchin said, ""On the personal tax side, middle-income people are getting cuts and rich people are getting very little cuts or, in certain cases, increases"" under the Republican tax bills. Mnuchin's suggestion that middle-income Americans would do better than richer Americans stems from an analysis that looks only at the bills’ change to personal taxes, not at other types of taxes being rewritten in the bills, such as business and estate taxes. Once the proposed changes to these other taxes are taken into account, the bills’ tilt towards middle-income earners flips to become a tilt towards wealthier Americans.

"['Taxes', 'New York', 'Brian Higgins']","
Not all state and local tax deductions eliminated in House Republican plan
","Rep. Brian Higgins, D-Buffalo, claimed the House Republican tax reform bill could slash middle-class incomes as much as 9 percent. New York state taxpayers would lose money if Congress decides to end the federal deduction of state and local taxes, he said. ""The elimination of income and sales taxes in New York is equal to 9 percent of taxable income, meaning that if you make $100,000 a year you lose $9,000,"" Higgins said at a hearing. ""If you make $50,000 a year, you lose $4,500."" About 3.3 million people in New York state take advantage of the state and local tax deduction, according to the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a tax policy and research organization. More than half of those who take the deduction make $100,000 a year or less. Is Higgins right that those taxpayers could lose as much as $9,000? Explaining the SALT deduction The current tax code allows taxpayers to deduct their state and local taxes from their federal taxes. About one-third of filers do this in New York state. That helps residents in states like New York where property taxes are higher. Filers can also deduct either their state income tax or sales tax, but not both. The House Republican tax plan would cap the maximum property tax deduction at $10,000 and end the deduction for state income and sales tax altogether. About two-thirds of filers choose instead to take the standard deduction, a fixed amount set each year. Where’s the number from? What Higgins said is different from what he meant to say, said Theresa Kennedy, the congressman’s spokeswoman. He meant to say filers would no longer be able to deduct $9,000 -- not lose $9,000 outright. Higgins supports that claim with data from the Government Finance Officers Association. The group said the average state and local tax deduction in New York state is equal to 9 percent of a filer's income. That's where Higgins get the $9,000 figure from. Nine percent of $100,000 is $9,000. That’s in the ballpark. People making between $75,000 and $100,000 deduct $9,949 on average in state and local taxes, according to data from the Tax Policy Center. ""How much they'll actually save depends on the tax rate,"" said Frank Sammartino, a senior fellow at the center. Couples making $100,000 are currently taxed at 25 percent. That wouldn’t change under the Republican plan. A $9,000 tax deduction could save that couple $2,250 in tax, according to the IRS. One caveat Even if Higgins had said deduction in his statement, he would still be wrong. Higgins made his claim after House Republicans decided to keep the deduction for property taxes. The deduction would be capped at $10,000. If someone’s property tax bill is more than that amount, the difference could not be deducted. The Senate bill does not include that proposal. Sammartino said Higgins’ claim would hold up if there isn’t a compromise. ""Nine thousand would be true if it was a complete repeal,"" Sammartino said. ""But it would be something less than that"" with the deduction for property taxes. The average property tax deduction is $6,522 for someone making between $75,000 and $100,000 in New York. That falls below the cap. ""People would be protected to some degree,"" Sammartino said. Kennedy, the spokeswoman for Higgins, said the bill still affects residents in his district, regardless of the final numbers. ""We can debate the exact numbers which will be different for each taxpayer, but the bottom line is that hardworking Western New Yorkers have a lot to lose in both the Senate and House legislation which continues to change by the minute,"" Kennedy said. Our ruling Higgins said New York state taxpayers could lose as much as 9 percent of their taxable income if state and local tax deductions end. Higgins meant to say residents would no longer be able to deduct 9 percent of their income from their federal taxes, not that they would lose that money outright. But even if he said what he meant, that would still be inaccurate. House Republicans came to a compromise on property tax deductions that refute the numbers in his statement.

No, NASA Antarctica study didn’t discredit climate change science
","The public has been misled by climate change advocates about the real reason behind the melting of Antarctica’s western ice sheet, claims the website American News. ""BUSTED: NASA Accidentally destroys every climate change advocate by exposing massive truth behind Antarctica,"" states a Nov. 8 headline. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially misleading, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We emailed American News but did not get a reply. The American News story refers to a real study by NASA, but the headline falsely suggests that the study debunks climate change advocates. A NASA scientist involved in the study told us the headline is inaccurate. Here’s the real story: On Nov. 7, NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, Calif., issued a summary of the study about the heat source under West Antarctica. The paper, ""Influence of a West Antarctic mantle plume on ice sheet basal conditions,"" was published in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Solid Earth. According to the NASA press release, the study ""adds evidence that a geothermal heat source called a mantle plume lies deep below Antarctic Marie Byrd Land, explaining some of the melting that creates lakes and rivers under the ice sheet."" The heat source isn’t new or increasing, but may help explain why the ice sheet collapsed so rapidly in an earlier area of climate change and remains unstable. Some 30 years ago, a scientist at the University of Colorado Denver suggested that heat from a mantle plume under Marie Byrd Land might explain regional volcanic activity and a topographic dome feature, NASA wrote. Recent seismic imaging has supported this concept. The American News story used an actual quote from the NASA press release by the first author of the study, Hélène Seroussi. When she first heard the idea, she said, ""I thought it was crazy. I didn't see how we could have that amount of heat and still have ice on top of it."" To study the concept, NASA scientists used a numerical depiction of the physics of ice sheets  to capture natural sources of heating and heat transport from freezing, melting and liquid water; friction; and other processes. Mantle plumes are thought to be narrow streams of hot rock rising through Earth's mantle and spreading out like a mushroom cap under the crust, NASA wrote. The Marie Byrd Land mantle plume formed 50 million to 110 million years ago, long before the West Antarctic ice sheet came into existence, NASA wrote. ""At the end of the last ice age around 11,000 years ago, the ice sheet went through a period of rapid, sustained ice loss when changes in global weather patterns and rising sea levels pushed warm water closer to the ice sheet -- just as is happening today,"" NASA said. Erik Ivins, a scientist and the second author on the study, told PolitiFact that the study didn’t address climate change. ""The study itself is about steady state conditions that would exist at the bottom of the ice sheet for many many millions of years,"" he said. ""We think of climate change as occurring 10 years, 100 years, maybe 500 years -- our study has nothing to do with those time scales."" The NASA study is about the bottom of the ice sheet. Climate change has had an impact on the top of the ice sheet. Warmer ocean waters intruding on the ice shelf causes the ice shelves to break up. When grounded ice sheets exit the land and go into the water that causes sea level rise ""This study doesn’t discredit that,"" he says. ""Nothing in our paper has anything to do with climate change."" We interviewed a few experts on climate change including Ben Strauss, vice president for sea level and climate impacts at Climate Central, a news organization that focuses on climate change. ""It merely suggests the presence of a natural contributor to West Antarctic ice sheet melt and instability,"" he says. ""It does not prove that this is the only factor. It does not state that it explains all of West Antarctic mass loss. Saying that a natural heat source disproves any effect of human-caused climate change is just as ridiculous as saying that natural moonlight disproves illumination from a streetlamp.""

Out-of-context comments inflate stabbing statistics
","Mass shootings are on the rise. This year has seen the Las Vegas massacre and two church shootings occur and spur lots of discussion in media, legislature and households. The topic of gun laws continues to be a partisan issue. ""FBI Uniform Crime Report for 2016 shows more than four times as many people were stabbed to death than were killed with rifles of any kind,"" Schroer wrote on Twitter on Oct. 17. The tweet featured a Breitbart article with the information and a link to FBI crime data. We weren’t sure about stabbings killing more people than rifles, so we decided to check the numbers for ourselves. Schroer’s office pointed us to the same data as the Breitbart article, so we started there. First, it appears that the Breitbart article is talking about national numbers, so we assume Schroer is doing the same. Schroer uses the term ""rifles."" The data provided by the FBI breaks down murders by types of firearms, and rifles is a subsection of all firearm murders. When totaling the data from the FBI crime report, we see that 374 people were killed by rifles, while 1,604 were killed by knives or cutting instruments. That means about 4.3 times as many people were killed by knives or cutting instruments as were killed by rifles. ""He is comparing a full set of cutting instruments to a partial set of guns which makes cutting instruments look more deadly,"" said Dr. James Nolan, a sociology professor at West Virginia University. Nolan used to work for the FBI as a unit chief in the Crime Analysis, Research and Development Unit. ""The real story from the data is that the odds of being murdered by a firearm are nearly seven times higher than the odds of being murdered by a knife or cutting instrument,"" he said. When you look at firearms murders overall, the number is staggeringly different: 11,004 murders out of 15,070 total murders were committed with firearms. That is, 73 percent of U.S. murders were committed with firearms — 3.4 percent of firearm murders were committed with a rifle. The other categories are shotguns, handguns and ""type unknown."" The FBI acknowledges the data are not comprehensive: Not all homicide data is submitted to the FBI. The page holding the data has a disclaimer that says, ""The data are based on the aggregated data from agencies within each state for which supplemental homicide data (i.e., weapon information) were reported to the FBI."" It also points out that Florida’s data didn’t meet regulations and is not included, and Illinois and Alabama submitted limited data. That means a few large cities, like Chicago, may not be perfectly represented in this data. Also, murders in the ""type unknown"" category could include rifles but were not identified as such when submitted to the FBI. That could change the comparison of rifles to stabbings. Schroer said that more than four times as many people were stabbed to death than were shot and killed by rifles in 2016. Schroer is cherry-picking data by comparing all people who were stabbed to death versus a small percentage of those that were shot to death. In 2016, 73 percent of U.S. murders were committed with firearms, but while 10.6 percent were committed with some type of knife or cutting instrument, just 2.5 percent were committed using rifles.

Mike Collier leaves out context in claim that Dan Patrick, Republicans snatched retiree benefits
","In a Halloween email blast, a Democrat hoping to deny Dan Patrick a second term as Texas lieutenant governor charged Patrick and his fellow Republicans with harming Texas teachers. Mike Collier of Houston said: ""Earlier this year, Dan Patrick and Republican leadership snatched millions of dollars in benefits from retired teachers, claiming that they couldn't afford to pay for the benefits they'd promised."" Were millions in benefits taken away? We asked Collier for his factual backup. By email, a campaign adviser, Chaille Jolink, pointed to news stories describing actions by the 2017 Texas Legislature expected to leave more than 260,000 retired educators and dependents with fewer health plan choices and greater out-of-pocket costs. That result--fewer health plan choices and higher costs starting in January 2018--remains undisputed, we found. Before the legislative actions, for instance, retiree health care premiums, deductibles and other benefits had been frozen, at legislative direction, since 2005. A June 2017 Houston Chronicle news story quoted state Sen. Joan Huffman, R-Houston, saying, ""There's no getting around that there's an increased cost to the retirees. I can only say that we'll continue to watch it and continue to hope there's a solution that will drive down the costs."" Then again, lawmakers did not take back any benefits in place for all of 2017 and the spending and other steps they ultimately approved, by bipartisan unanimous votes and with the backing of a group representing retirees, may have spared the TRS-Care program from shuttering for lack of funds. Interim report warned of collapse Before lawmakers came together in 2017, an interim Senate-House committee said inaction wasn’t a reasonable option. The panel’s November 2016 report noted that several times since the 1985 Legislature created state-supported health coverage for public school retirees, legislators had shored up TRS-Care. The health plans, overseen by the Teacher Retirement System of Texas, draw funding from retiree premiums and percentages of active-employee payrolls contributed by the state, school districts and existing school employees. The interim report went on to say lawmakers had yet to find a permanent way to sustain the health care benefits in the face of escalating medical costs and the addition of about 20,000 participants a year--including more costly retirees not yet 65 and eligible for Medicare. ""As of April 2016, the TRS-Care shortfall is projected to be from $1.3 (billion) to $1.5 billion for the 2018-2019 biennium,"" the report said. ""Even more alarming, the shortfall for the following biennium is expected to range from $4 (billion) to $6 billion. Absent ""drastic"" steps, the report said, the TRS board would be forced to cover the projected shortfalls by driving up retiree premiums, copayments, deductibles and other out-of-pocket expenses--moves likely to lead retirees to flock to the system’s zero-premium catastrophic health plan, which had 28,964 enrollees as of December 2016. The report said that such a shift in enrollment, in turn, would reduce needed revenues and ultimately lead the TRS board to close the TRS-Care plan and start phasing out participants. Retirement system confirms risks of inaction In November 2017, we asked the TRS if a shutdown of TRS-Care seemed likely in the event of legislative inaction. By email, Merita Zoga told us the system had testified as much with nearly all presentations indicating that without legislated changes or additional funding, TRS-Care ""would have quickly become unsustainable."" Zoga pointed us to a January 2017 TRS presentation to legislators showing possible cost ripples for retirees if legislators didn’t act. For a retiree alone, that chart suggests, monthly premiums for two TRS-Care plans offering more than basic coverage would escalate by 43 percent to 337 percent. Some greater increases are indicated for a retiree and spouse; a retiree and child; or a retiree and family.              SOURCE: Presentation to Texas Senate Finance Committee, Teacher Retirement System of Texas, Jan. 24, 2017 (received by email from Merita Zoga, director of governmental relations, TRS, Nov. 14, 2017) Zoga said TRS did not project other out-of-pocket expenses (such as deductibles and copayments) because actual expenditures would depend on how often a person draws on the coverage. Legislators spent more, authorized insurance changes Next, legislators in the 2017 regular session agreed to spend more on TRS-Care in the state budget, Senate Bill 1, in part by inching up the state’s contribution to the program to 1.25 percent of active school workers’ payroll and school districts’ contribution to 0.75 percent of active employees’ payroll. The budget also includes another $182.6 million in what’s described as a one-time appropriation to shore up the program. Together, the streams of funding generated $483.9 million in additional TRS-Care funding for 2018-19. Members also advanced, by unanimous floor votes, House Bill 3976, also signed into law by Gov. Greg Abbott. In part, that measure ended the longstanding requirement that TRS offer retirees the zero-premium basic catastrophic health plan known as TRS-Care 1. It also directed the system to start offering a high-deductible plan for retirees not yet 65. The action further enabled TRS to pare available health care plans from three plans to one for each age group--retirees 65 or older and retirees younger than 65. Legislators softened increases ahead After the session, the predicted higher costs for reduced offerings touched off an outcry from retirees, perhaps leading Abbott to fold improved TRS-Care benefits into his July 20, 2017, expansion of the agenda of a summer special session. Legislators subsequently sent for Abbott’s signature two measures, HB 21 and HB 30. The measures provided another $212 million in 2018-19 supplemental funding intended, in part, to reduce the TRS-Care cost hikes for retirees, including spending on premiums, deductibles and prescription drugs set in motion during the regular session. One upshot, TRS said, is the 2019 Legislature could face a projected 2020-21 TRS-Care shortfall of $500 million to $700 million. By all accounts, the summer actions lessened the pending pinch on retirees. According to a fall 2017 TRS presentation to retirees, the legislative intent was to reduce deductibles and out-of-pocket costs from what they would have been through 2019. An example from the presentation: Retirees not on Medicare would newly face an annual deductible for family coverage of $3,000, compared to $6,000 before the summer session, while such retirees would face maximum out-of-pocket deductibles of $11,300 compared to $13,300 before the actions. A chart in the presentation shows retiree premium costs before the changes and after (the middle column revealing expected premiums before legislators acted in the special session):  SOURCE: Presentation to Texas Retired Teachers Association fall meeting, Teacher Retirement System of Texas, undated (accessed Nov. 14, 2017) Consulting a retired teachers advocate To our inquiry about Collier's claim, Tim Lee of the retired teachers association told us by phone that he hadn’t characterized any benefits as ""snatched"" but also didn’t know if that’s the wrong descriptive. ""These are benefits these people had before that are not there now,"" Lee said, adding by email that "" ""the benefits went down, the costs went up, and the plan is still on shaky ground."" Lee also said the group endorsed the legislative actions and remains grateful that a state-supported health plan will survive. Gauging effects for retirees not yet 65 Asked to be specific, Lee said by email that retirees not yet 65 would no longer have a zero-premium plan. Zoga, of the TRS, confirmed that contrast, though she noted by email that the zero-premium plan that’s soon to be history carries a $5,250 deductible; as of 2018, retirees not yet 65 will pay a $200 monthly premium and have a $1,500 deductible. Lee said too that retirees younger than 65 have counted on traditional benefits including copays for medical and pharmaceutical coverage. Zoga agreed copays will no longer be offered though she said that once such a retiree fulfills her or his deductible, the plan will pay 80 percent of subsequent costs, the retiree 20 percent. Checking effects for retirees 65 and older Retirees 65 and older, Lee wrote, ""have lost access to a traditional Medicare supplement plan under TRS. They will now have access to a Medicare Advantage plan only."" Lee called the new offering a reasonable plan though he said it will impose ""markedly higher premiums, deductibles and out-of-pocket costs."" Zoga confirmed that most retirees will see an increase in premiums though she said a few will pay less than before. Retirees in one of the current TRS-Care plans, she said, would see an $800 decrease in their deductible for 2018 to $500. Lee also told us that many medical providers say they’ll refuse to accept the new plan and retirees are weighing whether to commit to the new TRS plan or shop for a plan accepted by their provider. Zoga didn’t confirm that many doctors have said they won’t take the new plan. By one analysis, she said, 96 percent of existing TRS-Care providers had at least already billed the insurer that will be providing the new plan. In addition, Lee said, retirees 65 or older are seeing costs for coverage for spouses nearly doubling. ""Many retirees simply cannot afford the $394/month for spousal coverage,"" Lee wrote. ""Again, the Legislature’s actions in the special session did provide more help to these retirees by lowering the new premium amounts (about a $50 reduction for spousal premium),"" a figure confirmed by Zoga. Still, Lee said, ""these amounts are still a heavy burden as the average TRS pension is $2,000/month. And, many do not receive any Social Security."" Zoga advised that 95 percent of retired Texas school workers didn’t qualify for Social Security retirement checks. What was Dan Patrick’s role? Lee, asked about Patrick’s role in driving the changes, said: ""During the special session, he took a strong personal interest in trying to make the situation better."" We also shared Collier’s claim with Patrick, who oversees the Texas Senate, and didn’t hear back. Our ruling Collier said Patrick and Republican leadership this year ""snatched millions of dollars in benefits from retired teachers."" Benefits are shrinking: Starting in 2018, retirees enrolled in TRS-Care will have access to fewer health plans and they’ll mostly face greater costs. But this claim leaves out details and vital context. That is, legislators agreed to this course across party lines. In addition, inaction could have left TRS to phase out retiree health plans entirely. Meantime, TRS forecasts another funding shortfall likely demanding legislative attention in 2019. On balance, we rate this claim Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.
