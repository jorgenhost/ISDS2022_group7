Paul Krugman compares projected shortfalls for Texas, California, New York and New Jersey
","
Texas, a model of fiscal soundness? Not so, writes Paul Krugman, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and liberal op-ed columnist for the New York Times.

In his Jan. 6, 2011 column, titled ""the Texas Omen,"" Krugman opines that the Texas-style ""modern conservative theory of budgeting"" ain’t all it’s cracked up to be, now that fiscal reality has intruded. Though he notes that ""comparing budget crises among states is tricky,"" Krugman does just that, writing that ""data from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities suggest that the Texas budget gap is worse than New York’s, about as bad as California’s, but not quite up to New Jersey levels.""

We wondered if Krugman’s comparison was on target. In response, he pointed us to a table in a Dec. 16, 2010 report by the Washington-based center, which studies the impact of state and federal budget decisions on low-income Americans. The report, headlined ""States Continue to Feel Recession’s Impact,"" says the national recession has caused the steepest decline in tax receipts on record, resulting in ""a state fiscal crisis of unprecedented severity.""

Table 3 in the report lists nearly every state confronting a projected fiscal 2012 budget shortfall and compares each shortfall to the state’s fiscal 2011 budget. The table says Texas faces a $10 billion shortfall, amounting to 22.3 percent of its 2011 budget. The New York budget gap equals $9 billion, 9 percent of its 2011 budget, while the expected gaps for California and New Jersey equal $19.2 billion (22.2 percent) and $10.5 billion (37.4 percent), respectively, of each state’s 2011 budget.

So, the 2012 Texas shortfall appeared to be worse than New York’s, about as bad as California’s, but not quite up--actually, hardly close--to New Jersey’s level.

The report says the center’s sources for the Texas breakdown includes an analysis of state agency budget requests and other information by the Austin-based Center on Public Policy Priorities, which advocates for programs that serve low-income Texans. The two similarly-named organizations occasionally collaborate on projects.

We called Eva DeLuna-Castro, the Austin center’s senior budget analyst, who said the shortfall figure cited for Texas reflected her earlier research indicating that the state would need about $20 billion in additional revenue to extend current programs and services through 2012-13. One year’s worth of the shortfall estimate is $10 billion. DeLuna-Castro noted that at the time of the Washington center’s research, Texas state government expected to spend $45 billion in fiscal 2011, a figure since reduced to $42.6 billion to account for agencies’ spending cuts last year.

DeLuna-Castro said she has studied the California shortfall projection and thinks the Washington center’s research is solid there. She said she hasn’t studied projected shortfalls for New York or New Jersey. Finally, she cautioned that comparisons might overlook the fact that Texas lawmakers could tap billions of dollars in the state’s rainy day fund. She said other states, which budget annually, may have already dug into such funds.

That seems a reasonable point. The Texas rainy day fund could ease the state’s shortfall--a fact not mentioned in Krugman’s column. Then again, tapping the fund requires a two-thirds vote of the GOP-majority Legislature, and some Republican legislators have said the fund is off-limits.

Finally, the lead author of the state-by-state comparison, Elizabeth McNichol, a senior fellow with the Washington center, told us the comparison would soon be updated to reflect increases in projected shortfalls for Texas and California. ""The problem that Texas is facing is on a similar level to these other states,"" McNichol said.

As we noted recently, the Center for Public Policy Priorities now estimates that Texas needs nearly $27 billion more than the state expects to raise from taxes and other sources to maintain current government services and programs through 2012-13. McNichol told us by e-mail that the Washington center consequently considers the updated 2012 Texas shortfall to be $13.4 billion, equal to nearly 30 percent of the 2011 budget.

At the time of Krugman’s column, the projected Texas shortfall was nowhere near New Jersey’s level. The comparisons of expected shortfalls in Texas, New York and California were accurate.

"['Labor', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Chain email']","
A chain e-mail claims Gov. Scott Walker hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to raid the state employee retirement system to balance the state budget
","
In some circles in Wisconsin, especially government workers, an e-mail has been ricocheting from in-box to in-box making an eye-popping claim.

In short: Gov. Scott Walker hired convicted Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen to oversee a raid on the state employee retirement system to help balance the state budget.

The claim is presented in what appears to be a news article by Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reporter Lee Bergquist. it is meant to mimic an online story, complete with a Jan. 13, 2011 date and a tally of reader comments.

At one point, it jumped from e-mails to the Internet, briefly appearing on a Little Chute teachers union website.

The story is a fake. And the statement is false, ridiculously so.

But the episode gives us a chance to explore, as best we can, how the piece -- apparently an attempt at satire -- made it into the public sphere.

In some ways, this is a political version of e-mails we see -- and pass along -- all the time.

You know, jokes about why the Chicago Bears still suck, or silly pictures taken of customers at Walmart.  

This one left some people taking the claim seriously -- calling the governor’s office, state union leaders and the Journal Sentinel newsroom. The item reached other teachers union locals and workers in other professions, including the state Department of Corrections.

And it has become a flash point between Walker and union leaders, who already have a rocky relationship.

Here’s the gist of the non-news.

The fake story claims Walker has hired former Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen (not true). And that Jensen plans to use the state retirement system to help Walker balance the state budget (again, not true). It also includes this over-the-top (yet again, not true) statement:

Jensen assured police and fire officials that their pensions are safe under Governor Walker but that public employees and teachers who never put their lives on the line nor contributed to the fund ought to be worried. ""Those folks need to take a long hard look in the mirror and reflect on what they have taken away from the people of Wisconsin.""

The fake story goes on to ""quote"" Jensen comments from a (never occurred) appearance on Charlie Sykes’ radio talk show on WTMJ-AM (620).

We don’t know for certain where the fake story came from, though there have been accusations, which we will explore below.

We do know when it jumped to the Internet.

How did the item get on the Little Chute Education Association site? Union president and Little Chute High School science teacher Chris Choudoir took the blame.

He said the fake story came to him in an e-mail on Jan. 14, 2011.

He posted it on the site, which was launched in November and aimed at the union’s 130 members. In less than an hour he learned he had been punked.

""It’s not a legitimate article, so I removed it from the blog,"" Choudoir said. ""My intention was not to propagate a false article."" He sent an e-mail apologizing to his members for the posting. The item was on the site 50 minutes, he said.

He added: ""That’s the problem with things in type - you don’t pick up on the sarcasm.""

Choudoir said traffic for the site was high that day -- some 499 hits when he took the article down. Some of those hits came from Walker’s office, which said it received three phone calls and five or six e-mails about the matter.

Walker’s office blames the Wisconsin Education Association Council, the statewide teachers union, for spreading the false e-mail. Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie noted that some copies of it bear the name of an employee who appears to work for the union and sent it to ""all,"" including district chapters of the union.

In one response to a teacher who contacted Walker’s office, Werwie wrote: ""Scott Jensen has no role in the Walker Administration and Governor Walker is not going to raid the pension fund.""

Werwie concluded: ""It is unfortunate that instead of working to be part of the solution the union who represents you, which claims to have your best interests in mind, spends its time spreading lies and making up fake news stories.""

WEAC denied responsibility for the e-mail.

""We can’t confirm where the e-mail came from,"" said spokeswoman Christina Brey. ""We didn’t generate it.""

Brey said union  leadership told its regional directors about the item and told them ""no, this is not right. It’s a hoax."" She added: ""We’ve taken internal action to make sure that news articles are authenticated.""

Let’s take a deep breath.

Someone -- it’s unclear who -- tried to give the  ""Weekend Update"" fake news treatment to a topic that clearly has public employees concerned. Walker has promised that cuts will be made in public employee benefits and suggested the state could reduce union bargaining rights. It may have been a bit of satirical venting, but not everyone got the joke.

PolitiFact’s national site has evaluated 90 chain e-mails, and found many of them to contain simply ridiculous claims. This fake news story joins the heap.

Feel free to forward these words: Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/jan/21/chain-email/chain-e-mail-claims-gov-scott-walker-hired-convict/
"['Ohio', 'History', 'State Budget', 'Taxes', 'Jay Hottinger']","
Rep. Jay Hottinger's assessment of this Founding Father unfounded
","
None of the Founding Fathers is more quotable than Benjamin Franklin.  

Arguably the greatest mind of the founding generation, he was a printer, journalist, scientist, inventor, financial thinker, statesman, diplomat and musician -- among other things. His range of interests and prolific writing over his 84 years produced a shelf of memorable maxims, thoughts and observations.

One of the most famous was quoted in the Ohio House of Representatives when Republicans introduced a plan to repeal the state's estate tax.

""Ben Franklin once quipped that only two things in life were certain: death and taxes,"" said Rep. Jay Hottinger, a Republican from Newark. ""I think even he didn't envision that the tax man would visit on the day of your death -- and that's something that needs to end here in the state of Ohio.""

PolitiFact Ohio was intrigued, mostly because we wondered if there really was anything that Franklin could not envision. So in a week where we marked the 305th anniversary of Franklin’s birth (Jan. 17, 1706), we looked to see what history might reveal.

Ohio wasn’t yet a state during Franklin’s lifetime. The federal estate tax wasn’t enacted until 1916, during the Progressive Era, partly as a way to break up large accumulations of wealth. Inheritance taxes, levied on those who receive property from an estate, were imposed as an emergency revenue measure three times before that.

The first was in 1797, the same year that Thomas Paine’s essay ""Agrarian Justice"" was published. In the essay, Franklin's friend and protege proposed creating a sort of national social security fund, financed by a 10 percent tax on inherited property.

Franklin died in 1790, but ""Agrarian Justice"" does contain echoes of his writing.

In a letter to Robert Morris in 1783, Franklin wrote about the right of the public to regulate property passing to heirs: ""All Property, indeed, except the Savage's temporary Cabin, his Bow, his Matchcoat, and other little Acquisitions, absolutely necessary for his Subsistence, seems to me to be the Creature of public Convention. Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it.""

Basic property necessary for  man to live should be left alone, Franklin wrote. But he continued that ""all Property superfluous to such purposes is the Property of the Publick, who, by their Laws, have created it, and who may therefore by other Laws dispose of it, whenever the Welfare of the Publick shall demand such Disposition.""

We thought one sentence has particular relevant here:  ""Hence the Public has the Right of Regulating Descents, and all other Conveyances of Property, and even of limiting the Quantity and the Uses of it.""

In the book ""Wealth and Our Commonwealth,"" William H. Gates Sr. and Chuck Collins write: ""The nation’s founders and populace viewed excessive concentrations of wealth as incompatible with the ideals of the new nation. Revolutionary era visitors to Europe, including Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Paine, John Adams, and Ben Franklin, were aghast at the wide disparities of wealth and poverty they observed. They surmised that these great European inequalities were the result of an aristocratic system of land transfers, hereditary political power, and monopoly.""

If you Google ""death and taxes,"" you'll find Franklin's quote cited frequently in arguments against the estate tax, often called the ""death tax"" by opponents. Franklin, 83 and ailing, made the quip to friend Jean Baptiste Le Roy, a French physicist, in one of the letters whose tone Isaacson calls  ""inappropriately lighthearted.""

Franklin wrote: ""Our new Constitution is now established, and has an appearance that promises permanency; but in this world nothing can be said to be certain, except death and taxes.""

We sought further guidance from Franklin authority Dr. Michael Zuckerman, professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania, which Franklin founded. There is ""nothing whatever in that quote pertinent to estate taxes,"" he responded.

But Franklin, he told us, did not view taxes negatively. Rather, Zuckerman said, he was ""mistrustful of great wealth, and quite supportive of inheritance taxes.""

Even today, the ""tax man"" does not literally ""visit on the day of your death,"" and we take Rep. Hottinger's quip as a figurative expression for the reality of a tax being imposed on the deceased person's estate. And that, he said, was something Franklin likely couldn’t envision.

But to the contrary, biographers, historians and even Franklin’s own writings suggest pretty clearly that it was a concept he would have supported.

For that reason, we rate the statement as False.

Deal healthcare prediction seems close, but needs more details
","
Georgia Gov. Nathan Deal, like many conservatives, is sickened by the federal health care legislation that passed last year.

""When you start talking about the financial obligation this bill will place on this state and every state, it's huge,"" Deal said in a December interview with The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

Deal said earlier this week to the Georgia Healthcare Association that the bill will cost the state government an additional $250 million a year in Medicaid costs, beginning in 2014.

We're well aware of the ongoing debate about whether the bill is a good piece of legislation. Most Democrats and progressives praise the legislation, saying it expands health care to more Americans. They also note that the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said the health care legislation will reduce the deficit by $124 billion over 10 years. Most Republicans and conservatives argue the bill is a classic example of government overreach, dispute the deficit estimates and say it will hurt small businesses.

We're not here to argue the merits of the bill. Our curiosity was piqued by Deal's claim about the legislation's impact on the Peach State. Will it, as Deal said, have a ""huge"" impact on Georgia? Or is he scaring us?

""When you expand eligibility for a program, you enlarge costs,"" said Stephanie Mayfield, a spokeswoman for the governor. ""Under new regulations, a family of four earning $30,000 a year can join the Medicaid rolls. You multiply how many new recipients will come on the state rolls by the amount the average recipient costs the state and you're talking about a huge cost. There's no debate on this issue.""

So how much will this cost Georgia taxpayers?
There will be many health cost reductions and cost increases as a result of the bill. Many of those will be determined by regulations yet to be written. But one of the biggest costs will be for Medicaid, the health program for low-income Americans. And those costs have already been widely calculated.

In 2014, anyone with an income below 133 percent of the federal poverty level, currently about $30,000, will be Medicaid eligible. There were about 1.4 million Georgians on Medicaid in 2010, according to the state Department of Community Health. One widely used estimate, by the Urban Institute for the Henry F. Kaiser Family Foundation, suggests an additional 774,000 Georgians will be eligible under the new plan. Deal estimates an additional 650,000 Georgians would be eligible.

The Kaiser Foundation estimates Georgia will spend an additional $714 million to $1.2 billion on Medicaid between 2014 and 2019 as a result of the legislation. The conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation estimates the Peach State will spend $1.3 billion during federal fiscal years 2014 to 2020. The Heritage Foundation based its estimate on data from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. The annual average of both projections is about $200 million a year.

The state Department of Community Health's budget says its budget for Medicaid and Peachcare, the state's program for uninsured children, is about $1.4 billion. An additional $200 million in spending would result in about a 14 percent increase.

Karen Minyard, executive director of the Georgia Health Policy Center, said including Medicaid, there are about 10 changes involving the federal legislation that may have an impact on state finances. They include the health insurance exchange, where people can buy insurance policies that meet minimum standards for coverage. An estimated 1.7 million Georgians who do not have health insurance and 387,000 residents with nongroup insurance will be able to buy coverage through the health insurance exchange, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

Minyard also said the state may have to spend more money to cover its own employees, hire people to implement the program, provide additional immunization and oral care, and cover other costs.

Minyard, whose center is based in Georgia State University's Andrew Young School of Policy Studies, said many of the costs will not be known until additional details are worked out by state and federal lawmakers.

""When I think of the magnitude of this change, it is going to be a very big change,"" she said. ""There is no way to get around it.""

The state's Department of Community Health estimated the additional cost in 2013 could be anywhere from $100 million to $200 million, according to one state report. It could rise to $500 million a year between 2014 and 2019, according to a September 2010 report put together by the Georgia Senate's research office. Most of the cost to care for new Medicaid recipients will come from the federal government, experts say. The state's costs do not accurately reflect the state's costs under the final version of the bill, the Senate report said.

Georgia's current fiscal year budget is about $18 billion. The highest annual projections of the impact of the health care legislation, $500 million, would be approximately a 2.8 percent increase to the state budget. Deal's projected increase in Medicaid costs amounts to an average of $250 million a year, which is a 1.4 percent budget increase. The governor's number does not include other projected costs.

The percentages may seem small, but considering the state's grim financial state, an additional $500 million to the budget would be significant. However, those projections are not as solid as the studies by Kaiser and the Heritage Foundation.

Considering that the precise impact of the legislation on Georgia is yet to be determined, we think it's somewhat early for Deal to say exactly how big the impact will be on state finances. But every indication is that it will be significant. The governor's statement is largely correct but needs clarification.

Still, in a financially struggling state where the budget, by law, must be balanced and where Medicaid consumes a significant portion of that budget, the governor makes a valid point.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Health Care', 'Eric Cantor']","
The health care law a ""job killer""? The evidence falls short
","
Poll after poll shows Americans' top concerns are the economy and jobs, which explains why Republicans have labeled the health care law as ""job-killing."" On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives approved a repeal measure that Republicans formally titled the ""Repealing the Job-Killing Health Care Law Act."" It is sponsored by House Republican leader Eric Cantor.

We've read a number of critiques that say the law isn't quite the ""job killer"" that Republicans claim it is, so we wanted to investigate for ourselves and evaluate the evidence. The Republican leadership recently published a document titled, ""Obamacare: A budget-busting, job-killing health care law,"" which cites several pieces of evidence for its job-killing claim:

""Independent analyses have determined that the health care law will cause significant job losses for the U.S. economy: the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office has determined that the law will reduce the 'amount of labor used in the economy by … roughly half a percent...,' an estimate that adds up to roughly 650,000 jobs lost. A study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses (NFIB), the nation's largest small business association, found that an employer mandate alone could lead to the elimination of 1.6 million jobs, with 66 percent of those coming from small businesses.""

We first turned to the Congressional Budget Office report. The CBO is a nonpartisan agency that provides economic analyses to members of Congress on how legislation will impact the federal budget and the economy as a whole. In August 2010, it published a new outlook that considered the jobs impact of the new health care law.

The Republican report is right that the CBO has determined that the law will reduce ""the amount of labor used in the economy,"" but the GOP report leaves out many important qualifiers. The CBO report actually says:

""The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that the legislation, on net, will reduce the amount of labor used in the economy by a small amount—roughly half a percent—primarily by reducing the amount of labor that workers choose to supply. That net effect reflects changes in incentives in the labor market that operate in both directions: Some provisions of the legislation will discourage people from working more hours or entering the workforce, and other provisions will encourage them to work more. Moreover, many people will be unaffected by those provisions and will face the same incentives regarding work as they do under current law.""

Basically, the CBO is saying that some people right now are working mostly to keep their health insurance. Once they have other options -- to enroll in Medicaid, or to qualify for tax breaks to buy insurance from a health exchange -- they might choose to work less. The CBO describes this as a ""small segment"" of the population. And, because the CBO is describing reduced hours rather than lost jobs, it never uses the 650,000 number that the Republican document cites. The Republican extrapolated that number from the CBO's estimate of one-half percent of the labor supply. Finally, we should point out that a person who voluntarily chooses to work less is not having their job ""killed"" by federal legislation.

Now let's turn to the other piece of evidence, the study that claims that the health care law will result in 1.6 million lost jobs. That number comes from a study by the National Federation of Independent Businesses.

The problem with this study is that it isn't based on the law that passed. It was published on Jan. 26, 2009, before a finalized House or Senate bill had even been proposed.

In the NFIB study, ""Small Business Effects of a National Employer Healthcare Mandate,"" the authors made hypothetical assumptions based on what they thought the law might include. Specifically, the study assumed that all companies would be required to offer private health insurance to their employees, and that the employers would have to pay for at least half of the cost of the insurance premiums.

""The results indicate that without major reductions in the cost of healthcare, the employer mandate would cause the economy to lose over 1.6 million jobs within the first five years of program implementation. Small firms would be most adversely affected by the mandate and account for approximately 66 percent of all jobs lost,"" the report said.

But the report's assumptions don't match up with the final version of the health care law. The law actually exempts companies with 50 or fewer workers from any mandate, so many of the small firms ""most adversely affected"" in the NFIB study are not required to offer insurance.

According to the study, firms with 19 or fewer jobs accounted for 467,182 of the 1.6 million job losses. Those companies would be exempt from the mandate, so the 1.6 million figure is at least inflated by 467,182. The next category was firms with 20 to 99 employees, estimated to shed 420,600 jobs as a result of a hypothetical employer mandate. Presumably a good percentage of those are companies with 50 or fewer employees, and again, are exempt from the health care law.

One of the authors of the NFIB study, Michael J. Chow, acknowledged there are ""material differences"" between the assumptions made in the study and what actually became law. The NFIB did not produce an updated study based on the realities of what ended up in the health care law. The organization continues to oppose the health care law.

""We still have concerns about the employer mandate and the final law in general,"" Chow said.

We should note here that the final law did not include a direct mandate. Rather, it enacted a fairly complicated way to fine employers if any of their workers qualify for new federal tax credits aimed at helping people buy insurance. Health care experts we've interviewed conclude that most large employers will be fined if they do not offer insurance.

In evaluating this statement, we should reiterate that the health care law is a complicated piece of legislation. Large employers who do not currently offer insurance or who offer limited coverage will see greater costs under the bill, either because they will have to buy their employees new or additional coverage or they get hit with fines. 
We asked Cantor's office about whether the bill was ""job-killing."" A spokesman insisted that it was, pointing to individual business owners who said they would face increased costs under health care. He also pointed us to a letter organized from the American Action Network, a conservative think tank. The letter, signed by 200 economists, said, ""The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act contains expensive mandates and penalties that create major barriers to stronger job growth. The mandates will compete for the scarce business resources used for hiring and firm expansion."" 
To be clear, the health care law will cost some employers money, particularly large ones. The CBO says that  fines imposed on large employers will affect low-wage workers the most. But it also says the effect will be somewhat limited.

We should also note that the major part of the legislation does not go into effect until 2014, and even after that, it will take time for workers and employers to see how it plays out. 
""To the extent that changes in the health insurance system lead to improved health status among workers, the nation’s economic productivity could be enhanced,"" the CBO said in its report. ""It is not clear, however, whether such changes would have a substantial impact on overall economic productivity or output. Moreover, many of the effects of the legislation may not be felt for several years because it will take time for workers and employers to recognize and to adapt to the new incentives.""

Republicans have used the ""job-killing"" claim hundreds of times -- so often that they used the phrase in the name of the bill. It implies that job losses will be one of the most significant effects of the law. But they have flimsy evidence to back it up.

The phrase suggests a massive decline in employment, but the data doesn't support that. The Republican evidence is extrapolated from a report that was talking about a reduction in the labor supply rather than the loss of jobs, or based on measures that weren't included in the final health care law. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2011/jan/20/eric-cantor/health-care-law-job-killer-evidence-falls-short/
"['Health Care', 'Texas', 'Michael Burgess']","
Michael Burgess says 2010 was worst year ever for doctors in Medicare
","
A Texas doctor in the U.S. House, Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Lewisville, closed out 2010 by telling a Fox Business Network interviewer that the year was awful for physicians participating in Medicare, the federal program that helps cover medical costs for the elderly.

""This is the worst year ever for America’s doctors who are reimbursed under the Medicare system,"" Burgess said Dec. 28. ""2010 will go down as a year in infamy. It may have gotten a little bit better right at the end of the year, but it’s ... a system that itself is on life support.""

In an interview, Burgess told us his gloomy take reflects delays by Congress last year in stopping a formula-driven reduction in what Medicare pays physicians, fueling uncertainty among doctors counting on the payments to stay level. He said improvement came late in 2010 when Congress extended a 2.1 percent rate increase through 2011.

Some background: In 1997, according to the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, Congress voted to tie Medicare physician payments to a complex formula based on the number of Medicare beneficiaries, the overall growth in the economy, changes in law or regulation affecting the utilization of services and a special factor – the Medicare Economic Index – that reflects the rate of inflation in physicians’ costs.

Spokeswoman Ellen Griffith said via e-mail that if the annual rate of growth in Medicare spending for physician services is greater than the target, then payment rates must be cut. And, she said, only Congress can override the cut or change the formula. Under the formula, Medicare rates went up from 1998 through 2001, but went down about 5 percent in 2002.

From 2003 through 2005, Griffith said, Congress intervened to stop or reverse formula-driven rate cuts. In 2006 and 2007, Congress froze physician rates at the 2005 level. In 2008, Congress overrode the formula-driven cut to approve a .5 percent increase, later voting to increase rates by 1.1 percent for 2009, she said.

In June 2010, the Texas Medical Association characterized the rates as""stagnant"" for the past decade while the cost of running a medical practice increased 28 percent.

Meanwhile, some doctors have fled the Medicare program. According to a May 17, 2010 Houston Chronicle news article, more than 300 Texas doctors ended their involvement with Medicare in the previous two years, including 50 in the first three months of 2010. Before 2007, only a handful (for instance, seven in 2006) annually opted out, the newspaper said.

In 2007, 70 doctors notified Trailblazer Health Enterprises, the state's Medicare carrier, they would no longer participate. The number was 151 in 2008, 135 in 2009 and was on pace to reach 200 in 2010, the newspaper said.

Hold the stethoscope. So Medicare rates actually went down in 2002 and stayed flat from 2005 through 2007 -- yet Burgess ranks 2010, when rates eventually rose, as the worst year ever for doctors. How come? 
Burgess told us his assessment has to do with how Congress dealt with the issue last year -- in fits and starts.

According to a timeline compiled by the medical association, Congress voted March 3, 2010 to delay a 21 percent rate cut to April 1. While the cut was then supposed to take effect, the centers instead stopped processing physician claims to carve time for Congress to intervene, Griffith said. On April 15, Congress stepped in, delaying the 21 percent cut until June. 
In June, the cut  took effect, meaning some reduced-rate payments went out, though Griffith said those were reprocessed after Congress in late June put a 2.2 percent rate increase in effect through November, retroactive to June 1. 
Before the end of the year,  Congress delayed the formula-driven rate twice more, finally voting to extend the 2 percent increase through 2011.

Burgess told us the pauses in Medicare payments made things difficult for doctors who were counting on them: ""The electric company is not going to say we understand, pay that light bill when you get around to it. Your nurse doesn’t come in one morning saying you don’t need to pay me this week. Drug companies... still send the bills, your fixed costs still run. So where is the only place that you give in a small doctor’s office? The doctor doesn’t get a paycheck that month... That is what no one in Congress understands. When we jack around with this stuff, we are hurting people on the front lines who are taking care of patients.""

Steve Levine, spokesman for the Texas Medical Association, said Congress created ""a formula that is not viable in terms of covering the costs of providing care to people on Medicare. Both parties are to blame. Leaders and at-large leaders of both parties have told medicine year after year after year, we feel your pain and want to fix it. Both parties have had opportunities to do so and have not.""

On whether 2010 was ""the worst year ever,"" Levine said ""most Texas physicians would say the constant threat of a 20 (to) 25 percent cut was what made this year so exasperating."" He added later by e-mail: ""The constant uncertainty over a much, much larger cut combined with five weeks of held payments made it bad, very bad. What we're talking about here is physicians' perceptions, which can't be measured as objectively as you're trying to do.""

Our finding: Hitches in congressional action on an anticipated big cut in Medicare rates surely contributed to physicians’ financial worries in 2010. However, their rates increased slightly at mid-year and the increase is scheduled to hold through this year. It’s difficult to see how that makes 2010 the worst year ever for Medicare doctors compared to 2002, when rates went down, and some subsequent years when rates were frozen.

""92 percent"" of the Obama administration has no private sector job experience, freshman Florida congressman claims
","
Steve Southerland successfully campaigned on a message that Washington and the Panhandle incumbent he ousted, Allen Boyd, were out of touch with mainstream American thinking.

Now in Congress, Southerland isn't letting up.

In a speech on Jan. 17, 2011, before the Liberty County Chamber of Commerce, Southerland described what he calls the ""Serengeti principle"" of personal responsibility -- ""wherein the gazelle wakes up every morning knowing he must outrun the fastest lion, or he will die, and the lion wakes up every morning knowing he must outrun the slowest gazelle, or he will starve."" Southerland, according to coverage provided by the Tallahassee Democrat, said the federal government ""picks winners"" through a maze of subsidies and social programs that have saddled future generations with massive debt and stifled business with over-regulation.

""It is ugly,"" he said. ""If you look at the finances of this nation, going forward, it terrifies me, the tsunami of debt, the tsunami of financial obligations we're staring at. And yet, they want more — an administration where 92 percent have never worked outside government.""

Southerland, like many Republicans, has argued that Congress needs to work to reduce government spending and repeal the federal health care bill passed in 2010. But in this fact check, we wanted to analyze Southerland's claim about the Obama administration, that part of the reason it is out of touch is that so many of its highest officials have been solely government workers.

It turns out this is the case of a bad political myth being recycled.

Fox News talk show host Glenn Beck seized on the same claim in November 2009. It started on the Internet, based on a study by Michael Cembalest, the chief investment officer for J.P. Morgan Private Bank.

In a column titled ""Obama's Business Blind Spot"" and published on Forbes.com, Cembalest wrote, ""In a quest to see what frame of reference the administration might have on this issue (of creating jobs), I looked back at the history of the presidential Cabinet. Starting with the creation of the secretary of commerce back in 1900, I compiled the prior private-sector experience of all 432 Cabinet members, focusing on those positions one would expect to participate in this discussion: secretaries of State; Commerce; Treasury; Agriculture; Interior; Labor; Transportation; Energy; and Housing & Urban Development.""

He continued, ""Many of these individuals started a company or ran one, with first-hand experience in hiring and firing, domestic and international competition, red tape, recessions, wars and technological change. Their industries included agribusiness, chemicals, finance, construction, communications, energy, insurance, mining, publishing, pharmaceuticals, railroads and steel; a cross-section of the American experience. (I even gave [one-third] credit to attorneys focused on private-sector issues, although one could argue this is a completely different kettle of fish.) One thing is clear: The current administration, compared with past Democratic and Republican ones, marks a departure from the traditional reliance on a balance of public- and private-sector experiences.""

In an accompanying chart, Cembalest reported that in the Obama administration, fewer than 10 percent of the Cabinet appointees counted under those rules had private sector experience. (The chart has since been updated -- more on that in a second.) According to the chart, all other administrations going back to Theodore Roosevelt's had rates in at least the high 20s, with the Eisenhower and Reagan administrations approaching 60 percent. (Cembalest wrote in a footnote that the data came from a number of sources, including capsule biographies of Cabinet members posted on the website of the University of Virginia's Miller Center for Public Affairs.)

The chart — reprinted by itself, without Cembalest's accompanying narrative — circulated in the conservative blogosphere for a couple of days before eventually being picked up by Beck.

PolitiFact writer Louis Jacobson looked into Beck's claim back then, and found much lacking.

In Obama's Cabinet, at least three of the nine posts that Cembalest and Beck cite — a full one-third — are occupied by appointees who had significant corporate or business experience. (The Cabinet technically includes 15 department heads and Vice President Joe Biden.) 
Shaun Donovan, Obama's secretary of Housing and Urban Development, served as managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co., where he oversaw its investments in affordable housing loans. Energy Secretary Steven Chu headed the electronics research lab at one of America's storied corporate research-and-development facilities, AT&T Bell Laboratories, where his work won a Nobel Prize for physics. And Interior Secretary Ken Salazar, in addition to serving as Colorado attorney general and a U.S. senator, has been a partner in his family's farm for decades and, with his wife, owned and operated a Dairy Queen and radio stations in his home state of Colorado.

Three other Obama appointees had legal experience in the private sector.

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke spent part of their careers working as lawyers in private practice. Clinton and Vilsack worked as private-sector lawyers at the beginning of their careers, while Locke joined an international law firm, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, after serving as governor of Washington state. At the firm, Locke ""co-chaired the firm's China practice"" and ""helped U.S. companies break into international markets,"" according to his official biography. That sounds like real private sector experience to us.

Finally, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm that advises international corporations on political and economic conditions overseas.

The occupants of the two remaining Cabinet posts cited in the chart do not appear to have had significant private-sector experience: Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood.

Obama's Cabinet has even more private-sector experience if you go beyond those nine positions. Vice President Joe Biden, officially a Cabinet member, founded his own law firm, Biden and Walsh, early in his career, and it still exists in a later incarnation, Monzack Mersky McLaughlin and Browder, P.A. And Office of Management and Budget then-director Peter Orszag -- that position too has Cabinet-level rank -- founded an economic consulting firm called Sebago Associates that was later bought out by a larger firm. (Orszag stepped down in July and the agency is now being run by acting director Jeffrey Zients -- who has his own private-sector experience as a managing partner for an investment firm focused on business and health care services companies.)

Now Southerland used the term ""administration,"" which has a much broader context than just Obama's Cabinet.

National Journal examined a larger group of senior Obama administration appointees in June 2009, and found that more than one in four have experience as business executives. That compared with the 38 percent the magazine found eight years earlier at the start of George W. Bush's administration. Still, the numbers for Obama are at least three times higher than the level claimed by Southerland.

The author of the chart quoted by Beck and requoted by Southerland, Cembalest, told PolitiFact that any effort to address the topic is heavily subjective, and he expressed regret that his work had been used for political ends, saying that it was not his intention to provide fodder for bloggers and talk show hosts.

Cembalest said he has ""written 250,000 words in research over the last decade, and every single thing I've ever done — except this one chart — was empirically based on data from the Federal Reserve"" or another official source. ""This is the one time I stepped out into making judgment calls, and I assure you I won't do it again. ... The frightening thing about the Internet is that people copy one chart from what you write and then it goes viral. So I've learned a lesson here that these kinds of issues are best left addressed by the people who practice them day in and day out.""

After the controversy in 2009, Cembalest updated his chart to reflect that more than 20 percent of Obama Cabinet appointees had private sector experience.

That brings us back to Southerland. He said that ""92 percent"" of Obama's administration has ""never worked outside government."" While rating someone's degree of private-sector experience is an inexact science, Southerland at the least is guilty of failing to keep up with Cembalest's own opinion on the matter. Cembalest now says that of Obama's Cabinet appointees that he studied, more than 20 percent have private sector experience. But more than that, the study itself is highly subjective, first because it cherry picks what Cabinet appointees to consider, and second because it unilaterally tries to define private sector work. On top of that, Southerland didn't single out the Cabinet, but instead said ""administration,"" which is a far wider pool of people.

"['Health Care', 'Wisconsin', 'Jim Sensenbrenner']","
Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner says Americans have ‘emphatically’ rejected the federal health care reform bill
","
As Republicans in the U.S. House of Representatives planned their January 2011 vote to repeal the health care reform bill, members turned to the results of the November election for support.

In Washington, Republicans swept to power in the House and narrowed Democratic majorities in the Senate. In Wisconsin, the GOP won a U.S. Senate seat, the governor’s office and both chambers of the Legislature. Repealing health reform -- ""ObamaCare,"" as they label it -- was a part of Republican campaigns at all levels.

In the run-up to the House repeal vote, U.S. Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wisconsin, appeared Jan. 16, 2010 at a town hall meeting. In comments to reporters, including WTMJ-AM (620), he discussed the rationale for pursuing repeal of the law. (On Jan. 19, the Republican-led House voted 245-189 largely along party lines to repeal the health care reform bill, but the effort is likely to die in the Senate.)

""The House of Representatives -- and this representative -- has listened to the American people,"" Sensenbrenner said. ""We had a debate on whether ‘ObamaCare' was the way to go to fix up health care and the American voters said no -- emphatically.""

Of course, public opinion can be a moving target. And election mandates can grow over time, especially in the eyes of the winners.

So we decided to take a look at Sensenbrenner’s statement, including at what current polls are showing.

Asked for support for Sensenbrenner’s position, aides noted he held 101 town hall meetings in his district last year.

""At these meetings, the overwhelming majority of attendees (public from the 5th District) were opposed to the healthcare bill and/or supported the law’s repeal,"" said communications director Wendy Riemann.

She added that 70 percent to 75 percent of those who called or wrote Sensenbrenner’s office since last February ""have been opposed to the law and would like to see it repealed.""

Sensenbrenner’s staff also pointed to a Jan. 17, 2011 Rasmussen Reports poll, the day after he spoke. That poll said 55 percent of likely voters favor repeal of the health care law, while 40 percent oppose repeal.

Here’s the question Rasmussen asked: ""A proposal has been made to repeal the health care bill and stop it from going into effect. Do you strongly favor, somewhat favor, somewhat oppose or strongly oppose a proposal to repeal the health care bill?""

On the face of it, 55 percent does not seem ""emphatic."" Indeed, according to the firm, the percentage strongly favoring repeal has fallen.

The firm’s summary said: ""Just 40 percent strongly favor repeal, matching the lowest level found since the health care bill became law. Thirty percent strongly oppose repeal.""

We found some other fresh polls, which provide a murkier picture than the one painted by Sensenbrenner.

The Associated Press conducted its own poll and reported Jan. 17 that ""strong opposition to the law stands at 30 percent."" The figure was close to the lowest level found in AP surveys dating back to September 2009.

""The nation is divided over the law, but the strength and intensity of the opposition appear diminished,"" the AP reported. ""The poll finds that 40 percent of those surveyed said they support the law, while 41 percent oppose it. Just after the November congressional elections, opposition stood at 47 percent and support was 38 percent.""

The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 4.2 percentage points.

As for repeal, only about one in four said they want to do away with the law completely.

Meanwhile, the Kaiser Family Foundation conducts a health tracking poll and in January 2011  issued an update about public opinion about reform.

""The last Kaiser Health Tracking Poll of the year found that 42 percent of Americans held a favorable view of health reform, 41 percent an unfavorable view and 18 percent offered no opinion. This pattern has been roughly stable over the eight months since passage, suggesting that neither side has been able to make a definitive case for or against the bill.""

Kaiser’s report added that 26 percent of those surveyed want to repeal the law in its entirety; 25 percent want to repeal parts of the law and keep other parts; one in five want to
leave the law as it is; and one in five want to expand the law.

Finally, a Jan. 7, 2011 Gallup poll concluded that Americans ""do not strongly endorse"" House Republicans’ efforts to repeal the bill.

Gallup found  that 46 percent of Americans want their representative in Congress to vote to repeal the health care law, 40 percent want their representative to vote to let the law stand, and 14 percent have no opinion.

That’s the view today. What about at the time of the election?

PolitiFact Wisconsin addressed this topic last fall, during the race for U. S. Senate. We looked into a television ad by Ron Johnson that claimed,  ""A majority of Wisconsinites opposed the government takeover of health care"" and rated the claim False.

In that case, the polling was more mixed than Johnson presented and, in some cases, respondents opposed the law not because it went too far, but because it did not go far enough.

Where does all of this leave us today?

Sensenbrenner said American voters had ""emphatically"" rejected the federal health reform changes. District residents may have felt that way, though calls to a congressman’s office are hardly scientific -- and Sensenbrenner’s statement cited national opinion on the issue. Also, numerous polls after the November election indicated that voters had one issue foremost in their mind: the economy.

Of four fresh looks at how Americans feel about repealing health care reform, his staff chose one -- Rasmussen’s poll of likely voters -- that supported his position. But that sentiment is not shared by the public at large, according to multiple other polls. And in the Rasmussen poll, the percentage strongly supporting repeal has fallen.

"['Ohio', 'Guns', 'Sherrod Brown']","
Sen. Sherrod Brown laments system failure that allowed Jared Loughner to buy a gun
","
Jared Loughner, the 22-year-old Tucson man accused of killing six people and injuring 13 others including Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, scared community college classmates even before his alleged rampage. He should have been diagnosed, treated and kept in a mental health institution as long as he was a danger to others, or so goes the national conversation.

But that never happened. 
And the shameful irony is that under a bill that President George W. Bush signed, ""if he had been identified with this mental illness, he would not have been able to buy this gun,"" U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown said in a discussion of the mental health safety net during an appearance on MSNBC’s ""Morning Joe"" program. ""I mean, the laws were there, but he fell through the system, he fell through the cracks, because he wasn’t identified because when he left the community college, nobody approached him, apparently.""

The system’s failure will be discussed by others for some time, but Brown, an Ohio Democrat, caught our attention for his other point on the Jan. 11 TV segment -- that ""laws were there"" already to prevent Loughner from buying a firearm, if only he had been diagnosed.

So we checked with the FBI, the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, the Ohio attorney general’s office, a group called Legal Community Against Violence and the Buckeye Firearms Association, a pro-Second Amendment group. There was no disagreement: A federal law passed in 1968 made it illegal to possess a firearm if you had been found by a court or legal authority to be a ""mental defective."" The prohibition also applied to anyone involuntarily committed to a mental institution.

Enforcement was strengthened with the Brady Handgun Protection Act of 1993, which established the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, or NICS, to conduct electronic background checks when individuals purchase guns. Another measure, signed by President George W. Bush, improved the reporting system as it pertained to mental health issues after the Virginia Tech massacre in 2007. Individuals may be released from the federal gun ban if they have deemed rehabilitated and are discharged from all monitoring.

Under Arizona law, it would not have been hard to get Loughner committed, according to reviews by news organizations. ""Arizona has one of the least restrictive laws when it comes to detaining apparently mentally ill people against their will,"" Reuters, a wire service, reported on Jan. 13. ""Under the state's broad involuntary-commitment statute, the government can mandate in-patient treatment for anyone determined to be ‘persistently or acutely disabled.’ That could include a broad range of seemingly troubled individuals.""

But the federal gun law has exceptions. 
The big one: Those who voluntarily get institutional treatment and bypass the need for court action aren’t barred from gun ownership, according to the groups with which we checked. That means that if community college officials, counselors or Loughner’s parents had convinced Loughner to check in on his own, he still would have qualified to buy a gun. ""Just being mentally ill is not going to be the triggerer"" for the prohibition, said Becca Knox, the Brady Center’s director of research.

For reasons that most agree are good, this country doesn’t keep a registry on mental illness. Mental illness is stigmatized enough already, and the majority of people who seek treatment ""will never commit a crime,"" said Jim Irvine, chairman of the Buckeye Firearms Association. ""We have talked about this and looked at it, and none of us at Buckeye have come up with a good solution. I don’t know how you deal with it, because you will have problems on all sides.""

Yet there’s another problem, gun control advocates say. Some people who have been forced into psychiatric treatment by state courts -- and therefore have a record at the state level -- still don’t show up in the NICS system. Only 26 states have statutes authorizing or mandating that their mental health adjudications be sent to the federal system, according to the Legal Community Against Violence.  Arizona does not have such a law, but it is one of nine states that provide the information to NICS anyway, said Robyn Thomas, executive director of Legal Community Against Violence.

Ohio, too, provides the information voluntarily -- but it didn’t until the state passed a concealed carry law that took effect in 2004, according to Toby Hoover, executive director of the Ohio Coalition Against Gun Violence and a Brady Center board member. This was confirmed by Lisa Peterson Hackley, spokeswoman for Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. The bill that Bush signed provided financial incentives for all states to participate, but no federal laws make participation mandatory.

So we come back to Brown’s claim that if Loughner ""had been identified with this mental illness, he would not have been able to buy this gun.""

Brown’s statement was generally correct. We’ll concede that  Brown was speaking as a guest on a fast-moving TV program where four other people were jumping in with opinions -- not exactly a forum for discussing the nuances of federal gun law.

Nevertheless, his statement lacked the caveat that if Loughner had been diagnosed but had committed himself voluntarily and was not adjudicated by a court, he still could have bought a gun legally. That’s a point of clarification important for a full understanding of his statement.

We rate his claim Mostly True.

Rep. Chris Van Hollen says insurance company profits quadrupled
","
As the debate over a Republican effort to repeal the health care reform law kicked into high gear on Jan. 18, 2011, Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., argued against repeal and began by citing a couple of statistics to set the stakes.

""I'm interested to hear my colleagues say that they can identify with all the problems in the health care system,"" Van Hollen said from the floor of the House. ""Between the year 2000 and 2006, premiums in this country doubled, health insurance company profits quadrupled, and this Congress did nothing.""

This statistic is nothing new in the health care debate.

In fact, we first visited a very similar claim when Sen. Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., wrote a Sept. 21, 2009, opinion piece for the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call in which he said, ""Insurance companies have seen their profits soar by more than 400 percent since 2001, while premiums for consumers have doubled.""

As we did then, we'll break this into two fact-checks. We'll deal with the claim about premiums in a separate item.

Here we'll address Van Hollen's claim that health insurance company profits quadrupled between 2000 and 2006. And we'll borrow heavily from our fact-check of that similar claim made by Rockefeller in September 2009. 
Rockefeller took his numbers about insurance company profits from a study sponsored by Health Care for America Now. Researchers for HCAN looked at financial data submitted by 10 large, publicly held health insurers to the Securities and Exchange Commission, covering the years between 2000 and 2008. The 10 companies are Aetna, Amerigroup, Centene, CIGNA, Coventry, Health Net, Humana, UnitedHealth Group, Universal American Group and WellPoint.

HCAN is a liberal group that supported the Democratic health care reform efforts, so we checked a few of HCAN's numbers by looking at some of the original disclosure forms on the SEC website and found no notable discrepancies. So the study appears sound.

The researchers found that the collective profits of these 10 companies rose from $2.41 billion in 2001 to $12.87 billion in 2007 — a 466 percent increase, meaning that, over that period of time, they more than quadrupled.

We dinged Rockefeller a bit for cherry-picking years, because, if you used, instead, the years 2001 through 2008, the data show that profits rose from $2.41 billion to $8.40 billion — a 249 percent increase. That's still a whopping jump, but it's not as high as the increase Rockefeller cited. The general dropoff in the economy had a lot to do with the lower profits in 2008, said Alex Lawson, a health care researcher for Campaign for America's Future, a liberal group, who co-authored the HCAN study, in a 2009 interview with PolitiFact.

Meanwhile, there's another caveat for HCAN's study. The group didn't adjust the profit statistics for corporate takeovers. When big companies absorb smaller ones, the net effect may be to enlarge the profits of the biggest companies (including many of the 10 giants in HCAN's study) even as the total size of the health insurance industry — the broader entity that Rockefeller seemed to be referring to — stays roughly the same. While doing such adjustments would have been logistically difficult, and maybe even impossible, the fact that they weren't done puts limits on how this data can be interpreted. 
A health industry analyst, Steve Shubitz of Edward Jones, told us in 2009 that consolidation is ""a very large part of this overall increase"" in the higher profits by the remaining 10 companies. ""Of course, these companies have increased profits, too, outside of acquisitions, but nowhere near to the extent that's implied by those stats,"" Shubitz said. 
Lawson acknowledged that the HCAN chart on profits does not address how much of an impact consolidation had on profits. But he added that the table actually comes from a study that specifically addressed the harm to competition caused by consolidation, so the group hardly ignored that issue. In addition, he defended the decision to use numbers unadjusted for consolidation. ""That's what the market reacts to, and that's what they put in their annual report,"" Lawson said. 
The insurance industry, for its part, argues that total health plan profits are less than one penny of the total national health expenditure dollar. ""The data is clear that profits are not what is driving rising health care costs,"" said Robert Zirkelbach, a spokesman for America's Health Insurance Plans, the leading health insurance trade group.

Back in 2009, we rated Rockefeller's claim Half True, noting that if he had carried the data forward to 2008 — an admittedly somewhat atypical year — the increase fell short of his stated quadrupling. But Van Hollen had a clearer reason to set the parameters between 2000 and 2006. Democrats regained control of the House in 2007. So it's fair for him to stop short of the 2008 figures. But as we noted when Rockefeller made a similar claim, the numbers Van Hollen used reflect 10 of the biggest companies as opposed to ""insurance companies"" in general. And the study did not adequately account for consolidation. But on balance, we rate Van Hollen's statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/19/chris-van-hollen/rep-chris-van-hollen-says-insurance-company-profit/

Here we'll address Van Hollen's first claim that between 2000 and 2006 premiums in this country doubled. The time frame cited by Rockefeller is a little different, but the source for fact-checking it isn't.

The Employer Health Benefits Survey, published by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust, is considered the definitive source for health benefits cost information, and its most recent data stretch from 1999 to 2010.

In 2000, average annual premiums for single people were $2,471, a number that rose to $4,242 by 2006 — a 72 percent increase. The amounts for family coverage rose over the same period from $6,438 to $11,480 — a 78 percent increase.
 
We also looked at just the portion of premiums paid by employees, because that's the number most consumers really care about. For individuals, the average premium paid by the employee went from $334 to $627; and for families, the employee contribution went from $1,619 to $2,973. That's an increase of 87 percent and 83 percent, respectively.

Those numbers get pretty close to Van Hollen's claim about doubling, but not quite. And so we rate his claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/19/chris-van-hollen/rep-chris-van-hollen-says-insurance-premiums-doubl/
"['Georgia', 'Food Safety', 'Jack Kingston']","
Georgia Congressman says food supply extremely safe
","
Congress has passed major legislation aimed at making food safer, but that doesn't mean it will pay for it.

Widely considered to be the first major overhaul of the agency's food safety provisions since 1938, the Food Safety Modernization Act tightens safety rules and boosts Food and Drug Administration inspections at an estimated price of $1.4 billion over the next five years.

That's way too high a price, some say. The nation's food is just fine to eat, said Republican U.S. House Rep. Jack Kingston of Savannah.

""We still have a food supply that's 99.99 percent safe,"" Kingston told The Washington Post. ""No one wants anybody to get sick, and we should always strive to make sure food is safe. But the case for a $1.4 billion expenditure isn't there.""

Kingston spokesman Chris Crawford repeated the claim in a Jan. 4 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.

The food supply is 99.99 percent safe? That sounds great, but is it true?

Kingston has a big say in whether food safety legislation gets funded. He is chairman of the subcommittee of the House Appropriations Committee that holds the FDA's purse strings.

""I would not identify it [funding] as something that will necessarily be zeroed out, but it is quite possible it will be scaled back if it is significant overreach,"" Kingston told The Post.

Crawford told us this is how Kingston and his staff determined the food supply is almost completely safe:

They took the Center for Disease Control and Prevention's latest estimate for the number of food-borne illnesses each year and divided it by the number of times people in the U.S. eat each year.

The CDC said that in 2011, just under 48 million people will contract a food-borne illness.

There are about 310 million people in the U.S. If they eat three times a day, that's 339.45 billion meals. And 48 million is roughly 0.01 percent of that. 

So Kingston's math is accurate. But does that mean his overall point is correct?

We found Kingston was comparing apples to oranges. He used CDC data that measured a person's risk of getting ill to measure the risk of the food safety supply. But those are not the same thing.  

The CDC's figure came out as part of an announcement that one out of six people in the U.S. will contract a food-borne illness in the coming year. In other words, about 16.66 percent of the population will have problems this year ranging from a bad stomachache to deadly kidney failure because of dangerous pathogens in their food.

We talked to Elaine Scallan, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Public Health who formerly worked for the CDC. She did research on which the CDC results are based.

Kingston's calculation measured the risk that your next meal will make you sick. But it is ""definitely not a good indicator of the safety of our food supply,"" Scallan said.

Each time you eat a meal, you take that same risk again. Over time, that risk adds up, Scallan said.

Robert Scharff, a professor at Ohio State University and a former economist with the Food and Drug Administration, calculated that food-borne illness costs the U.S. $152 billion annually.

His report described food-borne illness as ""a large problem that deserves the attention of policymakers."" He also noted in an e-mail interview with AJC PolitiFact Georgia that Kingston's approach only covered the risk of eating a single meal.

Other criticism was more blunt. Barbara Kowalcyk, director of food safety for the Center for Foodborne Illness Research and Prevention, expressed similar concerns and said Kingston's measure ""just doesn't make sense.""

New York University professor Marion Nestle, a well-regarded food safety and nutrition expert, had similar concerns.

""Isn’t 48 million people getting sick or dying unnecessarily worth doing something about? I think so,"" Nestle said. 

So experts think Kingston's method has a crucial, if not fatal, flaw. But we decided to dig deeper. We looked at a sampling of food safety tests to see whether their results resembled Kingston's.

A recently completed nationwide survey on young chickens by the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Food Safety and Inspection Service found some 7.5 percent tested positive for salmonella and 46.7 percent for campylobacter, which the CDC describes as ""one of the most common causes of diarrheal illness in the United States.""

The federal government also looked at fruits and vegetables at processing plants in 2008 and found that while 5 percent had e. coli bacterial levels that suggested they came into contact with unclean water, only 0.3 percent of samples tested positive for the form that can make you sick. It reported 16 of nearly 11,700 samples tested positive for salmonella. 

Consumer Reports magazine tested for salmonella and campylobacter in chicken it bought from grocery stores. Its results, published in the January 2010 issue, were that campylobacter was present in 62 percent and salmonella was in 14 percent. Both were present in 9 percent.

The magazine's publisher, the nonprofit consumer advocacy group Consumers Union, backed the food safety bill. 

To sum up:

Kingston's calculation mixed up its apples and oranges. He said his calculation showed that the food supply is ""99.99 percent safe."" But his numbers described something very different: the risk that your next meal will make you sick.

The problem is that you have to eat far more than your next meal to survive. And with each meal, your risk increases. Your risk of getting sick is actually much greater -- predictions say one in six people will get sick in 2011 from food-borne illness.

In other words, while Kingston's math is correct, his results didn't say what he claimed they did. Studies that do measure the safety of certain foods contradict him.

Since his statement has an element of truth but ignores crucial facts, his statement meets our definition of Barely True.",/factchecks/2011/jan/19/jack-kingston/georgia-congressman-says-food-supply-extremely-saf/

Gov. John Kasich hasn't dismissed privatizing Ohio Turnpike, if the numbers are right
","
Privatizing the Ohio Turnpike did not become an issue in last year's gubernatorial campaign, mainly because it was a subject on which incumbent Democrat Ted Strickland and Republican challenger John Kasich seemed to agree.

Neither candidate advocated it.

In contrast, four years earlier, GOP candidate J. Kenneth Blackwell proposed leasing the turnpike to a private entity for 99 years. The proposal echoed a deal by Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels, earlier in 2006, to lease the 157-mile Indiana Toll Road for 75 years to a Spanish-Australian consortium for a one-time payment of $3.85 billion.

Strickland, who had called Blackwell's plan ""irresponsible"" and ""a gimmick,"" said: ""I don't think the people of Ohio want to take a critical major infrastructure and turn it over to a private entity and thereby relinquish control over decisions regarding that infrastructure going forward for 50 or more years.""

The question was put to Kasich when Daniels joined him campaigning in Cleveland last July. Kasich said that privatizing the turnpike ""doesn't make a lot of sense"" because it would not be financially wise.

He said, ""The problem right now with considering privatizing the turnpike is you don't get any money for it. The capital markets are very terrible.""

Significantly, Kasich did not reject the concept as a matter of principle. But saying that the idea didn't make sense, and that there were problems with even considering it, he seemed to take the issue off the table.

Recently though, now-Gov. Kasich has again discussed the idea.

Exactly a month after being elected, he said he and his advisers were studying the idea,
although the timing was probably not right.

""Everything's on the table,"" he told reporters Dec. 2 after speaking at the annual meeting of the Ohio Farm Bureau Federation. ""You could do a lease of the turnpike. That's an entity up there that has had a life of its own. We of course are going to look at that.""

He said the sort of payment received by Indiana would be ""beyond reach,"" and ""So what? It would be billions, it would be more than one.""

Kasich knew the suggestion would raise eyebrows -- ""This will get me a lot of nice phone calls,"" he said -- and spokesman Rob Nichols pushed the idea to the breakdown lane to defuse it. Leasing the turnpike ""could have made sense years ago,"" Nichols said. ""It would be foolish now. We wouldn't get our money's worth in this market.""

Early this month, however, shortly before being sworn in, Kasich again was talking about leasing the 241-mile turnpike, which ended 2010 with a record $250 million in revenue.

""If we look at the turnpike and find out we’re in a bad market and we’re not going to get the number we want — and I have a number in my head as to what will work — if we don’t get the number, then we’re not going to do it,"" he told reporters at a news conference.

By saying he has ""a number in my head as to what will work,"" Kasich showed the idea isn’t dead.

He made it sound like for the right price, a deal could get done.

So has the governor changed his position?

Kasich downplayed the idea of privatizing the turnpike last summer during the campaign (while explicitly endorsing privatization in other areas), and he said the time was not right to consider it. But it’s important to note he didn’t completely dismiss the idea. Rather, he noted that the market wasn’t ripe for such a move.

His post-election remarks indicate the idea is clearly in play. But he’s still noting that certain conditions would have to exist --  ""If we don’t get the number, then we’re not going to do it.""

To us that seems pretty consistent.

That's why we rate his position on privatization of the Ohio Turnpike as a No Flip on the Flip-O-Meter.

Scott Walker hasn't done any public events in 2013, Democratic state senator says
","Gov. Scott Walker has so cocooned himself from regular folks, state Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson contends, that he ""hasn't done a public event in this entire year."" Wait, what? Larson made the statement Aug. 27, 2013, on Madison-area radio station WEKZ-FM (93.7), then quickly told liberal talk show host John Sylvester what he meant. ""Just to be clear, Sly. His events, they're open to press, donors and for invited guests. I wouldn't consider that a public event,"" Larson said. ""A public event, I would consider something where folks, the working class, can actually make it, where it's not working hours and it's something where it's not invite-only."" So, the Milwaukee Democrat has his own idea of what constitutes a public event, although we’re not bound by that definition in rating his claim. Narrow definition When we asked Larson to back his statement, he elaborated by saying that, besides being open without invitation and held outside of regular working hours, a public event should allow ordinary citizens to express opinions to or ask questions of the governor, he said. But that’s not evidence of what Larson said in the interview and it’s an even more narrow definition of public event. By that definition, most meetings of legislative committees -- typically scheduled during business hours -- are not ""public events."" And it suggests that when the governor visits a factory or business and talks to workers, it shouldn’t count simply because someone off the street couldn’t walk in and participate. So, Larson doesn’t exactly back off his claim. He just aims to shift it to more favorable terms for himself. Larson also pointed to a series of public hearings he held on evenings and weekends on the 2013-’15 state budget, saying Walker has appeared at no such events this year. There's no question that access to the governor -- really, any governor -- is limited. Walker typically gives a day’s notice to news media of what some of his appearances will be the following day. Indeed, he doesn't release detailed daily itineraries until weeks after the fact, a practice followed by Walker’s predecessor, Democrat Jim Doyle, for most of his time as governor. Yet, just a few weeks before Larson made his claim, there was Walker addressing folks along with Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, to open the Wisconsin State Fair, and attending the Governor’s Red, White and Blue Ribbon Livestock Auction. The fair, obviously, is about an accessible public an event as there is. So, let's take a closer look at where Walker has been. Events in 2013 Walker spokesman Tom Evenson sent us a list of more than 100 Walker events in 2013 that Evenson described as public. Some were easily accessible to the general public; others, because of cost, membership requirements or other reasons, weren't. Here's a sampling: The World Championship Snowmobile Derby in Eagle River, an event that attracted thousands. Television news coverage showed Walker delivering opening remarks and shaking hands with folks wearing snowmobile suits. A Martin Luther King Jr. ceremony in the Capitol rotunda in Madison. Hundreds of people attended the 33rd annual event, including a few who booed during Walker’s remarks, according to the Wisconsin State Journal. The annual State Education Convention at a Milwaukee hotel. Hundreds of school district officials and school board members heard Walker speak, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported. The three-day Governor’s Conference on Economic Development in Madison. Registration cost a minimum of $250 for Wisconsin Economic Development Association members and up to $340 for non-members. The National Rifle Association state convention in Wausau, where Walker gave a speech. A South Suburban Chamber of Commerce awards dinner in Oak Creek. More than 220 people attended, according to the chamber. The dinner cost $50. Military-related ceremonies in Pewaukee, at Camp Douglas and elsewhere. TV coverage of one event, at the Experimental Aircraft Association in Oshkosh, showed Walker speaking to a large gathering of Army National Guard members and their families. Independence Day parades in Menomonee Falls and Wauwatosa. A number of government meetings in Madison, including Walker presenting his state budget proposal and giving his ""state of the state"" address. In criticizing Walker’s availability to the general public, a progressive blogger pointed out that an upcoming meeting of the state Building Commission, which the governor is a member of, would be open to the public. An open house held by Pierce Manufacturing near Appleton to mark the firetruck maker’s 100th anniversary. Hundreds heard Walker speak, according to one account. Walker spoke to an audience of predominantly students in a speech at St. Norbert College in De Pere, the student newspaper reported. He also mingled with students and posed for pictures with them, according to images from a local TV station. The governor’s annual prayer breakfast. Tickets were priced at $30 and up. The annual Greater Milwaukee Law Enforcement Memorial Ceremony. Walker was among the speakers at the outdoor event, near the Milwaukee County Courthouse. News conferences, including one at the University of Wisconsin-Superior. TV news coverage showed an opponent of Walker’s state budget plan talking with the governor at the event. So, attendance is limited at some public events Walker attended, but not at others. In any case, Larson’s claim was absolute. Our rating Larson said Walker ""hasn't done a public event this entire year."" Larson may believe Walker needs to be more open, but it’s ridiculous to say Walker hasn’t done even one public event in 2013. We rate the statement Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2013/sep/08/chris-larson/scott-walker-hasnt-done-any-public-events-2013-dem/

Offshore wind power critic James O'Neil says wind power is the most unreliable type of renewable energy
","The debate over Deepwater Wind’s plans to build two wind energy projects in the waters off Rhode Island and Massachusetts has raised several issues. Critics say the energy from the five turbines the Providence company initially plans off Block Island and the more than 100 turbines to be built farther offshore would be unnecessarily expensive. Former Rhode Island Attorney General James O'Neil, a lawyer who is fighting the projects, also questioned the reliability of wind energy when he appeared on the ""10 News Conference"" program that aired Sept. 1. ""It's not about the green movement. It's about what I call the Green Bucks Movement,"" O’Neil said. ""You have to consider the economic consequences of embarking on a mission which is going into the unknown. We do know a couple of things. We know that wind power is the most undependable form of renewable energy."" That claim caught our ear. We know the wind doesn't blow all the time. But, then again, it does blow at night, when renewable solar energy can't produce electricity. So which form is less dependable? When we asked O'Neil for his data, he offered some documents that didn't actually compare the various forms of energy. One unpublished analysis offered no basis for that comparison. He also suggested some people to interview. As we learned, there's a lot of debate over the matter. When you ask the experts about dependability, they talk about several issues, among them the likelihood of mechanical breakdown, the availability of what we will loosely call ""fuel"" (which includes wind and sun), whether a source can generate power when it is most needed and, from a broader perspective, whether the power grid can quickly tap power from other sources to compensate when one source fails. Fossil fuel plants break down all the time, said Willett Kempton of the University of Delaware and coauthor of a 2012 study on integrating renewable energy into the power grid. When it comes to breaking down, ""generally, wind turbines are more reliable than thermal plants"" such as those powered by natural gas, coal or nuclear, he said. Solar cells, with few, if any, moving parts, are least prone to mechanical breakdown, giving it an edge over the renewable forms O'Neil was talking about. So a more relevant issue for renewable sources is the availability of fuel, particularly wind and daylight, which vary by location. (That's not a problem with renewable energy such as geothermal because the Earth is always giving off heat.) O'Neil, like other critics, argued that a key problem with wind power is its unpredictability, but Kempton said you can predict when the wind will be blowing. We note that the National Weather Service predicts both the amount of cloud cover and the average sustained wind on an hourly basis six days in advance. That brings us to a third element of dependability: whether the power is produced when you need it. William P. Short III, a New York renewable energy consultant who has testified against Deepwater’s Block Island project, said that's why wind is less dependable than solar. Solar usually produces power when the demand is highest, while winds kick up, at least on land-based wind farms, after dark, when demand is lower. But Michael Womersley, a professor of human ecology at Unity College in Maine, disagreed. ""You tend to get more wind during the day than at night."" The other experts we consulted said that's not important because other parts of the power grid can ramp production up or down to compensate. The ability of power plants to throttle up or down to respond to demand, and to do it quickly, is a fourth issue surrounding dependability. It's what experts call dispatchability, said  Paul Roberti, a commissioner with the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission. Fossil fuel plants are much more adept at that than wind or solar. In the end, we turned to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which regularly analyzes various forms of electrical generation to assess cost and capacity. Its latest report, which looks at projects expected to be working by 2018, is billed as ""a convenient summary measure of the overall competitiveness of different generating technologies."" The report includes a measure of capacity, which spokesman Jonathan Cogan said is a way to gauge the reliability or dependability of the latest technologies. The higher the number, the more you should be able to depend on it for power, although the actual percentage will vary by region when it comes to renewable resources. Nuclear and fossil fuel plants typically have capacity factors ranging from 85 percent to 90 percent. But O'Neil was talking about renewable energy. In the EIA ranking, geothermal comes in at 92 percent, biomass is at 83 percent, hydroelectric power is at 52 percent, offshore wind is 37 percent, onshore wind is 34 percent, solar panels that generate electricity directly are at 25 percent and solar-thermal, where the sun heats a substance to generate power, is at 20 percent. So on a nationwide basis, wind power -- whether it's onshore or offshore -- operates at a higher capacity than solar, according to the EIA. In response, O'Neil said his ""statement that wind is the most undependable form of renewable energy remains my opinion"" and, in the competition between wind and solar, ""it is rather a close call as neither is the most reliable form of renewable energy."" Our ruling In terms of energy, dependability can mean different things to different people, and both solar and wind have their strengths and weaknesses. And the actual dependability of each technology is going to rely -- to quote the old real estate joke -- on three things: location, location and location. The only national ranking we found was done by the U.S. Energy Information Administration, which takes various dependability measures into account. In that ranking, wind is less dependable than hydro, geothermal or biomass but more dependable than solar cells and solar-thermal. O'Neil made an unequivocal and over-arching assertion, but provided no useful support for it. The most convincing evidence we found says he's wrong. We rate his statement False.

Have gun-related homicides, other serious crimes decreased dramatically in the last 20 years?
","State Sen. Doug Whitsett recently took to the Internet to warn Oregonians that the Legislature was within a single vote of passing legislation that he said would have eroded the Second Amendment right to bear arms. We disagreed with Whitsett on the way he described the votes, in another fact check, but he said something else about gun-related homicides and crimes that we thought merited its own analysis: ""Unfortunately, too many people are simply unaware of the facts regarding the possession of guns, and the commission of gun related crimes. In fact, most families have been convinced by media reports that gun related crimes are on the increase in America. That simply is not true! Over the past twenty years, the number of homicides committed with a firearm in the United States has decreased by nearly 40 percent. The number of other crimes involving the use of a firearm has also plummeted, declining by nearly 70 percent … … All indicators point to the fact that our society becomes safer as more responsible families own guns."" We’ll be upfront: We have no idea if society is safer as a result of more responsible families owning guns. It’s not certain who owns firearms or how responsible they are. Also, some people would chalk up a decrease in firearm related homicides and crimes to better policing or to a decline in the crack cocaine epidemic of the 1980s and 1990s, or to other factors. Others would add that we should look at suicide and other statistics to get a fuller picture of how to address firearms policy. For example, more than 30,000 people die from firearms a year, including suicide. There are too many variables and opinions to make a definitive statement on safety and guns and society. But what we can fact check are the statistics Whitsett cites. Has the number of homicides committed with a firearm decreased by nearly 40 percent in the last two decades? Are other crimes involving firearms down nearly 70 percent? The Republican state senator from Klamath Falls said he based his remarks on a Bureau of Justice Statistics report from May 2013, which used statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. There were 11,101 firearm homicides in 2011, down from 18,253 in 1993, according to the BJS report. That is a 39 percent decline. Nonfatal crimes involving firearms declined 69 percent, from more than 1.5 million victims in 1993 to 467,300 victims in 2011. Those numbers back up Whitsett. The Pew Research Center released a separate report in May, also highlighting CDC numbers. It gives the same percentages and offers other calculations that back up the drops, including rates per 100,000 people. The Pew report noted that many Americans are unaware of the declines. The reports do not state definitive reasons for the decreases, but do point out that decreases were much steeper in the 1990s than in the 2000s. Apparently, 1993 was a peak year for homicides and the country has fared better since then. The numbers between 2000 and 2011 have gone up and down. Homicides and other violent crimes involving firearms have declined over the last two decades. Whitsett picked the numbers and years straight from a federal report issued in May, based on CDC statistics. The Pew Research Center, which is nonpartisan, used the same statistics. Readers can argue over what the declines mean, but they can’t take issue with the accuracy of his numbers.

URI faculty union director Frank Annunziato says professors low-paid among peers in New England, nationally
","For years, officials at the University of Rhode Island have complained that the state has underfunded the university, leaving academic salaries stagnant and forcing excessive tuition hikes. Frank R. Annunziato, executive director of the URI chapter of the American Association of University Professors, touched on the former issue in an interview with The Providence Journal in August. ""If you look at the other land grant universities in New England, we are last [in faculty salary] except for the University of Maine in Orono,"" he said. ""Our national organization does a survey every year. Of all the major research institutions, we are in the lowest quintile (20 percent) across the board. It’s a dire situation here."" In effect, Annunziato doubled down on something URI president David Dooley had said. In April 2012 PolitiFact Rhode Island ruled True on Dooley’s statement that URI salaries on average were second to last among major public universities in New England. The source of the data is the same this time as it was then: an authoritative annual survey by the AAUP made public in its magazine, Academe. AAUP gets its information by surveying the leadership of the institutions, not its member chapters. The most recent survey, for the 2012-13 fiscal year and published in the March-April issue of Academe, broke down the average full-time salaries by position for 1,251 U.S. institutions of higher education. The positions include full, associate and assistant professors, and, for institutions that have the position, instructor. When we broached the subject to Annunziato, he said that he was talking about averages for individual academic ranks as well as across ranks. And he said he was merely quoting Dooley from our previous fact-check on university salaries. We’ll break Annunziato’s statement into two parts. First, is it still correct -- about 1½ years after Dooley’s representation -- to say URI salaries on average are second to last among public land grant universities in New England? The short answer is yes. URI is one of six public land grant universities in New England. For those states with multiple campuses and varying salaries for each, salaries at the campus where faculty is the highest  paid were used for comparison. The AAUP database for 2012-13 shows URI’s salaries at each teaching level are lower than all the other New England institutions except for the University of Maine. That also holds true for the average salary for all ranks combined.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      At URI, according to the AAUP, full professors are paid an average of $105,100; associate professors, $78,700; assistant professors, $67,400; and instructors, $61,400. For all ranks, the average salary is $83,000. The highest salaries are paid at the University of Connecticut: $136,800 for full professor, $91,900 for associate professor, $73,900 for assistant, $67,900 for instructor, and for all ranks, an average of $101,400. (We should note that even though Annunziato relies on the AAUP data to make his argument that pay at URI is too low, he complains that the AAUP overstates average pay at URI because its survey omits ""lecturer"" -- the university’s lowest-ranking teaching position.) As for the second half of Annunziato’s statement, he said that he derived his conclusion that URI’s salaries ranked in the bottom 20 percent among major research institutions from the AAUP data. Annunziato said that when he mentions ""major research institutions,"" he is referring to so-called Category I institutions in the AAUP data. John W. Curtis, national AAUP director of research and public policy, told us that Category I includes major research institutions but is ""quite a bit broader than that."" The AAUP categorizes universities according to the number and variety of Ph.D.s the universities award. Annunziato also acknowledged that he cited all Category I institutions, including public and private, for his comparison. In effect, that would broaden the pay gap because private institutions generally pay better than public ones. When we looked at the data, we found that URI actually is in the 20 percent to 40 percent range in average salary in Category I institutions -- not, as Annunziato contends, the lowest 20 percent. The AAUP’s Curtis confirmed our finding. Admitted Annunziato, ""I will stand corrected."" Our ruling Frank Annunziato said salaries for URI faculty are second to last among New England land grant universities and in the lowest 20 percent of major U.S. research institutions. He is right on the first point and wrong on the second. The judges rule Half True.

Chain email claims Dee Dee Myers says Amb. Chris Stevens and her relative were killed by mob abuse in Benghazi attack
","A reader recently forwarded us a chain email about the attack on U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on Sept. 11, 2012. Similar emails have been circulating for months, speculating about how U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans were killed by Islamic extremists in the attack. But this email caught our eye because it was purportedly written by Dee Dee Myers, who once served as White House spokeswoman for President Bill Clinton. The email played up the significance of a well-known Democrat breaking with President Barack Obama over what had happened in Benghazi. The reader wondered if it was actually written by Myers, and so did we. Moments after we contacted Myers’ office, she emailed us back, saying she had nothing to do with the account. ""No, I didn't write it, don't have any relatives in the Benghazi Guard, didn't have any of the conversations or meetings described in the letter,"" she told PolitiFact. ""There is no truth to it whatsoever."" What the email said The email opens by falsely claiming that the account is directly from Myers and that one of her cousins was guarding the ambassador on the night he died. (Read the full text of the email.) The email then purports to tell a disturbing story about what happened that night. In the email's version of events, the cousin dies as well: ""... Ambassador Stevens was brutally murdered. His genitals were cut off, he was sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned. He was dragged thru the streets and left for dead. This is eyewitness testimony of a local Dr. who found the Ambassador in a ditch and tried to save his life.  He had no idea who he was. The other 3 men, including my cousin, met similar fates. ""Death due to smoke inhalation is a 100% fabricated LIE. ... The next week I drove my aunt and uncle and 2 others to DC to receive his body. We met with Hillary, whom I remain friends with, Panetta, and Susan Rice. All apologized saying it was a protest gone bad over a video and exited the area. Next Obama entered with the same story and made no apology and offered little sympathy."" The email ends with a lament for the Clinton years: ""The leadership of our country has reduced to lies and deception.......what has happened to us? How I long for President Clinton."" Myers herself told us she was not the author of the email and that its details concerning her or supposed relatives are fabricated. We still wondered whether there was any other evidence to support the email’s claims about how Stevens died. Was he ""sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned""? What we know about the night of the attacks After the attacks, the administration empowered an Accountability Review Board headed by former Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Mike Mullen and veteran diplomat Thomas Pickering. In its unclassified final report, the board said the scene was chaotic on the night of Stevens’ death. Officials lost track of Stevens around 11:30 p.m., until he arrived at the Benghazi Medical Center around 1:15 a.m. But the report makes no mention of any kind abuse to Stevens. Instead, it says he was brought to the emergency room by ""six civilians .. but to the best knowledge of the Board these were ‘good Samaritans’ among the hordes of looters and bystanders"" who arrived on the scene after the American personnel had left. The death, the report said, was due to ""apparent smoke inhalation."" Another group that reviewed the attack and its aftermath, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee -- controlled by Republicans -- made no mention of abuse either. Their report concluded that ""local Libyans found the remains of Ambassador Stevens in the main diplomatic building at the Benghazi Mission and transported him to the hospital. The Libyans apparently did not realize who the Ambassador was, but they alerted the State Department of his location by using the cell phone that was in the Ambassador’s pocket. Libyan doctors tried unsuccessfully to resuscitate Ambassador Stevens upon his arrival at the hospital."" These accounts also track with contemporary reporting. An Associated Press report included an interview with Ziad Abu Zeid, a Libyan doctor who treated Stevens. Abu Zeid told the AP that Stevens was unresponsive when he arrived at the hospital, but that ""we tried to revive him for an hour and a half but with no success."" Abu Zeid said Stevens had bleeding in his stomach because of the asphyxiation but no other injuries. A CNN reporter was told by Libyans that they found Stevens and brought him to the hospital. That report too made no mention of any kind of abuse, and a doctor said Stevens was covered in soot when he arrived. The CNN report includes amateur video that shows rescuers pulling Stevens through a window, a detail that tracks with what the Accountability Review Board concluded. Meanwhile, the rare published reports that supposedly back up the chain email have been the subject of strong pushback. A Lebanese news outlet, Tayyar.org, published a report soon after the attack that cited Agence France Press reporting that Stevens was raped before being murdered. However, the AFP subsequently released a statement saying that the Tayyar.org report ""falsely quoted our news agency and has no truth whatsover to it. AFP promptly sent a strongly worded complaint to that website and they removed the report and published a denial, saying that AFP did not report such a thing."" One key piece of evidence has not yet been made public: autopsy results. The FBI was charged with investigating the attack, but it has not yet produced a final report, which would presumably include an autopsy report. A call to the FBI on Sept. 6, 2013, confirmed that no report has been released yet. We will update this report when that information is publicly released. Our ruling The chain email forwarded an account purportedly written by Dee Dee Myers of how her cousin and Ambassador Chris Stevens were killed in the Benghazi attack, including being ""sodomized and beaten and cut and stabbed and burned."" Myers told PolitiFact that she had nothing to do with the email, and that anything it said about her was false. As for the email’s claims about Stevens’ being violently attacked and violated rather than killed by smoke inhalation, two government reports and several contemporary journalistic accounts cast strong doubt. The one Web report that supports this scenario was recanted by the website after the mainstream media source it had cited, Agence France Presse, said it had reported no such thing. The email is a combination of fabrication and unsupported speculation. We rate it Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2013/sep/06/chain-email/chain-email-claims-dee-dee-myers-says-amb-chris-st/

","Florida’s CEO-turned-governor has a big crush on businesses. Republican Gov. Rick Scott loves them so much that the majority don’t have to bother paying business taxes, he told a conservative crowd at the Americans for Prosperity Foundation conference in Orlando. Scott told the crowd that during his tenure the state has cut taxes five times (we noticed he pared down his claim quite a bit from earlier this summer when he said he cut taxes 24 times.) ""We cut property taxes for homeowners and businesses. We cut business taxes so today 70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax. And we got rid of a sales tax on machinery and equipment so we will have more manufacturing jobs."" Do nearly three-quarters of Florida businesses not pay a business tax? Corporate income tax exemptions grew under Scott  PolitiFact Florida has been tracking Scott’s promise to eliminate the corporate income tax rate over seven years. The tax is paid as a percentage of the incomes of Florida businesses. Scott initially wanted the Legislature to reduce the corporate tax rate, but that didn’t work out. So he took a different route: relieving businesses of paying the tax by upping the amount of income exempt from the tax. In his first year, Scott lobbied to exempt the first $25,000 worth of taxable income, up from $5,000. In 2012, he got the Legislature to raise the exemption to $50,000. Scott wanted to then raise the exemption to $75,000 but the Legislature didn’t go along with it in 2013. We turned to Florida Department of Revenue data to show what percentage of businesses don’t pay corporate income taxes. There were 49,562 corporations in total and 38,060 would have been exempt from the tax -- or about 76.8 percent in 2011. The tax exemption for those businesses adds up to $12.6 million. That left 11,502 businesses that paid about $166 billion in corporate taxes. These numbers represent the 2011 tax year, filed in 2012. The exemption has increased since then, so the number of exempt corporations may be slightly different. We should note that many of these small businesses didn’t have to pay the corporate income tax before Scott’s tenure, too. Department of Revenue data shows of the 38,060 exempt businesses, about half earned less than $5,000 and therefore were exempt before Scott took office. We interviewed two experts about Scott’s claim: Kurt Wenner of Florida TaxWatch and Sam Staley, managing director of Florida State University’s DeVoe L. Moore Center, which aims to increase public understanding about the role of government in a market economy. Both Wenner and Staley pointed out that large businesses have always paid the lion’s share of the corporate taxes -- and continue to do so after Scott’s exemptions. (The large businesses get that exemption, too, but for them it means they don’t pay the tax on a small slice of their income.) ""Small businesses don’t contribute that much to overall revenue,"" Staley said. Therefore, the state is ""not losing that much by exempting them."" However, even small businesses could be paying several other taxes or fees, such as property or sales taxes or in some cases, licensing fees. To assess a state’s business climate, ""you have to look at an entire portfolio of taxes and regulations,"" Staley said. ""Even if they don’t have to pay state corporate income tax, it might not be enough to compensate added costs of permitting at the local and county level,"" Staley said. Wenner said that anytime the state can reduce taxes it will increase Florida’s attractiveness for businesses. However, ""Florida’s corporate income taxes have never really been that high."" Our ruling Scott said ""70 percent of our businesses don't pay a business tax."" His general point was that during his tenure, he’s been cutting all sorts of taxes. State data for 2011 taxes shows that 76.8 percent of businesses don’t pay the corporate income tax due to the exemption. Scott is including some very small businesses here in his calculation and omitting that many of them were exempt from paying this tax before he took office. We rate this claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/06/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-majority-businesses-are-exempt-bus/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'Dan Patrick']","
Dan Patrick, who called Ted Cruz a fighter who wasn't getting facts straight in 2012, lately salutes senator's Reaganesque presidential potential
","In June 2012, conservative Dan Patrick of Houston charged Ted Cruz with airing mistruths in his U.S. Senate bid against Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst. Patrick, a Republican state senator, subsequently said he would vote for Dewhurst in the Dewhurst-Cruz primary runoff. Patrick, now challenging Dewhurst and others for his party’s 2014 lieutenant governor nomination, recently complimented Cruz by describing him as Reaganesque. In an Aug. 20, 2013, Texas Tribune interview, Patrick also said he would support Cruz for president should he seek that office. Has Patrick flip-flopped on Cruz? Chris Elam, spokesman for Republican Jerry Patterson’s lieutenant governor campaign, suggested as much. Elam was quoted Aug. 30, 2013, on the Dallas Morning News Trailblazers blog as calling Patrick’s recent ardor for Cruz ""a complete 180″ from Patrick’s criticisms of Cruz when the pair traded shots on a radio talk show June 28, 2012. ""Today he equates Cruz with Reagan?"" Elam said. ""A year ago, he sounded very different."" By telephone, Patrick told us that much changed between the described moments. ""The fact is, this time last year, Ted was not yet a proven commodity on the political stage,"" Patrick said. ""He had not held office."" Patrick also said: ""At that time, I thought"" Dewhurst ""was more qualified."" Cruz, a former state solicitor general who hadn’t previously run for office, upset Dewhurst for the Republican Senate nomination, before going on to win the general election. Patrick told us he was among Republicans who wholeheartedly supported Cruz once he was the nominee. Patrick and Cruz repeatedly clashed on the June 2012 radio program noted by Patterson’s camp. For instance, Patrick objected to Cruz’s descriptions of state Senate actions related to spending and unsuccessful measures related to so-called sanctuary cities and in-state college tuition for the children of illegal immigrants. According to a recording of the show posted online by commentator Scott Braddock, Patrick said several times Cruz was not getting his facts straight, including one exchange that started with Cruz saying Patrick had already endorsed Dewhurst in the Senate primary runoff. ""Time out, Ted,"" Patrick replied. ""That’s a lie… You’re just flat-out wrong."" Patrick went on to say he planned to vote for one of the two. Cruz also said Patrick was asking questions planted by Dewhurst’s campaign. ""That’s just not true,"" Patrick replied. After Cruz said a study indicated some Texas Senate Democrats had more success than conservative Republicans in passing proposals on Dewhurst’s watch, Patrick said the cited researcher didn’t understand the legislative process ""and I am beginning to think you don’t."" Then again, Patrick also said positive things about Cruz, calling him a good orator and a fighter. ""Both of you are good people,"" Patrick said in reference to Cruz and Dewhurst. On July 26, 2012, Patrick said in a Facebook post that he was voting for Dewhurst: ""He is well qualified based on the job he has done in Texas helping us pass the most conservative legislative package in the nation, limiting spending, and creating the best economy in the country,"" Patrick wrote. Patrick also wrote: ""Cruz is a bright and talented lawyer who is also a fiery orator. I respect those who see it differently. I'm not going to be critical of Cruz. He may well win and if he does we will rally around him in November."" By phone, Patrick recently called Cruz the Republicans’ best communicator since President Ronald Reagan. He told us that as a senator, Cruz ""has walked the talk. He has taken on the establishment. Our party needed this kick in the pants."" Patrick also suggested his aired support of Cruz for president is distinct from his declared vote for Dewhurst in the 2012 primary runoff. ""You’re dealing with three different races--U.S. Senate, lieutenant governor and president,"" Patrick said. Our ruling Patrick sparred with Cruz in June 2012--even deeming one Cruz claim a lie--and later revealed he was voting for another Republican for the Senate seat that Cruz later won. But Patrick also praised Cruz at the time as an orator and a fighter. Some 14 months later, Patrick saluted Cruz as a communicator, going so far as to invoke Reagan, while saying he would support him for president should he run. Patrick said this reflects his judgment of Cruz as a stick-to-his-guns officeholder. Our sense is it's incorrect to say Patrick has suddenly boarded the U.S.S. Cruz. Still, we see a substantive gap between accusing someone of lying and otherwise mangling facts and then committing to their possible presidential candidacy.

Rick Scott says next year's record tax collections result of 'conservative, pro-growth policies'
","Florida is set to collect more tax money next year than ever before, state officials say. And not only is Florida Gov. Rick Scott proud of the accomplishment, he is taking credit. ""After right-sizing government and cutting taxes, this year we had our first budget surplus in six years,"" Scott told conservatives gathered in Orlando for an Americans for Prosperity Foundation summit on Aug. 30, 2013. ""It gets better: Our state revenue estimating conference says we will have the highest general revenue in state history next year. Conservative pro-growth policies work in our state."" Scott’s right: State economists (the wonkishly called revenue estimating conference) say tax collections in the 2014-15 fiscal year will be higher in sheer dollars than ever. But crediting ""conservative pro-growth policies"" for the extra flow of money is a conclusion that ignores trends nationwide, as PolitiFact Florida found out. Future tax collections The state’s revenue estimating conference, one of 10 consensus estimating conferences, is comprised of members from the governor’s office, the Legislature and its research arm, the Office of Economic and Demographic Research. They meet throughout the year to come up with a best guess for how much money the state can spend. It’s an important job because Florida is required to balance its budget each year, so lawmakers need to have a good accounting of how much money is available. You can think of the state budget, which has grown to over $74 billion, as a three-legged stool. The first leg is what we’re talking about in this fact-check, general revenue. That money can be spent pretty much on anything because it’s the money the state most directly controls. The second leg is trust funds, or money that is collected for a specific purpose. A good example is the tolls you pay on Florida roads that are then earmarked specifically for road projects. The third leg is money that comes from the federal government and also has a specific purpose (Medicaid funding, for example). Amy Baker, director of the Office of Economic and Demographic Research, confirmed Scott’s claim about general revenue for fiscal year 2014-15. According to projections, the state is expected to collect a record $27.3 billion. The pot has not been this large since the 2005-06 budget year, when collections totaled $27.07 billion. However, it's not a record when adjusted for inflation. Revenue projections for 2014-15 are significantly lower than revenues in the 2005-06 fiscal year and slightly lower than revenues in the 2007-08 fiscal year, said Chris Mai, a research assistant at the State Fiscal Project at the left-leaning Center for Budget Policies and Priorities. ""That same amount of money in nominal terms is not enough to provide the same services -- education and health care -- as in 2008,"" said Elizabeth McNichol, a senior fellow at the center. Where does that money come from? Most states collect an income tax, but Florida does not. It leans heavily on its 6 percent base sales tax. Other big taxes that go into state general revenue include the corporate income tax, beverage and tobacco taxes, and documentary stamp taxes, which are based on real estate transactions. Florida’s sales tax collections are climbing primarily because of growth in personal income, population and tourism, Baker said. Even though year-over-year population growth is not as high what it was before the recession, it’s finally going up. That means there are more people to spend money on big-ticket items, such as houses, cars, appliances and, yep, Disney World tickets. That includes the first wave of baby boomers retiring nationally, many of whom are young, have cash to spend and are moving to Florida, said Karen Woodall, executive director of the left-leaning Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy. To try to associate that tax revenue growth with Scott’s conservative policies, the governor’s office directed us to a Moody’s Investors Services report that praised Florida’s fiscal management, including building up rainy-day reserves. The report predicted the state would likely outpace the nation in long-term growth because of its climate and low cost of living, ""as well as strong demographic and economic fundamentals, driven by the tourism, health care, and education sectors."" Yet, Moody’s said, the construction and real estate markets remain a drag on Florida’s economy, and the state is more vulnerable than the rest of the country if a new housing bubble emerges from outside investors. ""Florida’s difficulty in the last few years doesn't stem from its tax code,"" said Lyman Stone, a state tax economist at the business-backed Tax Foundation. ""It stems from having a real estate- and construction-driven economy in a real estate- and construction-driven recession."" So what does more revenue mean? Collecting a record amount of money is a sign Florida’s economy is en route to normalcy, which in Florida, translates to more people moving into the state and good tourism figures. But in the larger picture, Florida is not that special. The slow-and-steady recovery story is the same for most of the country, experts told us. In fact, several other states -- and plenty run by Democrats -- are doing better. Most states returned to or exceeded 2008 revenue levels by the 2012-13 fiscal year, said Todd Haggerty, policy analyst for the Fiscal Affairs program at the National Conference of State Legislatures. The growth continued for 33 states in 2013-14, though at a more modest clip. Not every state has released 2014-15 revenue expectations. Of those that have, 26 states and D.C. project revenue growth between 0.1 and 5 percent, Haggerty said. That's where Florida falls, along with New York and Texas.  That's behind a group of 11 -- Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Idaho, Maine, North Dakota, Ohio, Oregon and Vermont -- that expect growth between 5 and 10 percent. The NCSL does not examine in-depth why revenue is growing in each state, Haggerty said, though he noted some states (California) increased tax rates while others benefited from an energy boom (North Dakota). ""Given that the revenue recovery is happening in almost every state, it’s pretty clear that it’s a general trend,"" McNichol said. No one can fault Scott for talking up the state as a tourism and business mecca. But could he bring about record-setting tax collections through a toolbox of tax cuts and shrinking government, or as he put it, ""conservative pro-growth policies?"" Even economists on the conservative side are skeptical. ""We think certainly he’s doing the right things from an economic standpoint,"" said Kurt Wenner, vice president of tax research at Florida TaxWatch. ""But it’s certainly hard to dial a direct relationship between how much revenue comes from that."" Stone of the Tax Foundation pointed to a few examples of tax breaks passed under Scott that are ""straight-up revenue losses,"" such as the four-day sales tax holidays and an assortment of tax credits. Other longer-lasting, pro-business cuts are more likely to have economic benefits in the future, he said, such as temporarily removing a sales tax on machinery and equipment for manufacturers, removing businesses from the corporate income tax roll, and reducing unemployment compensation taxes. (The temporary tax cut for manufacturers won’t even take effect until 2014.) ""I’m skeptical that these changes drove a big enough economic recovery in revenue changes,"" Stone said. Our ruling Scott said that Florida ""will have the highest general revenue in state history next year. Conservative pro-growth policies work in our state."" Scott's statistic is wrong if you account for inflation. But the bigger issue is that Scott overreaches by connecting the revenue resurgence with conservative policies. The trajectory is not unique to Florida, or conservatives. There’s an element of truth to this statement but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

Mayors' group says Frank Wolf voted to let terror suspects buy guns
","U.S. Rep. Frank Wolf, R-10th, was recently targeted by the Mayors Against Illegal Guns, a group led by New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. ""Rep. Frank Wolf voted to allow terror suspects to buy guns,"" the group proclaimed on a web ad. We decided to look at this claim, which clashes with Wolf’s tough-on-terrorism record. The 32-year congressman has accused the Obama administration of covering up details about a terrorist attack last September on an American diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. He has vehemently opposed efforts to close the Guantanamo Bay prison and allow civilian trials for 9/11 terrorists. Kelly Steele, a spokesman for the mayors’ group, said the ad is based on a July 17 vote in the House Appropriations Committee on an amendment to the nation’s Commerce, Justice and Science appropriations bill. The amendment, introduced by Rep. Nita Lowey, D-N.Y., would have allowed the attorney general ""to deny transfer of firearms to persons known or suspected to be engaged in conduct related to terrorism."" It failed on a largely party-line 29-19 vote. The mayors’ group has targeted each of the representatives who voted against the amendment. ""Under current law, someone can be too dangerous to board an airplane -- but can still legally buy guns and explosives,"" the group says in a web posting. ""This dangerous loophole in our gun laws is called the Terror Gap."" The group is focused on an omission in the National Instant Criminal Background Check System, which the federal government and most states use to screen those buying firearms from licensed dealers. People may be barred from buying guns for a number reasons, including felony convictions, fugitive status, drug addiction, adjudication as mentally defective, status as an illegal immigrant, stay in the U.S. on a non-immigration visa, dishonorable discharge from the Armed Forces, a domestic violence conviction and criminal indictment. But the ban does not extend to those who are suspected of terrorist activity and are on the FBI’s terrorist watch list. That could include U.S. citizens, people in the U.S. on immigrant visas and people here from about 40 allied nations for which the U.S. does not require a visa. Since 2004, the federal government has kept data on the number of prospective firearm purchasers who are on the terrorist watch list. The 2011 cumulative figures showed of 1,453 people on the terrorist watch list who sought to purchase firearms or obtain an explosives license, 132 were denied for other reasons, while 1,321 were allowed to proceed. The FBI could not determine whether the purchase was actually made. The Bush administration in 2007 asked Congress to pass legislation to allow the attorney general to deny a firearm purchase or explosives license ""when the background check reveals the purchaser is a known or suspected terrorist and the attorney general reasonably believes that the person may use a firearm or explosives in connection with terrorism."" Every session since 2007, a bill to that effect has been introduced by Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., and referred to the House Judiciary Committee, where it has never come up for a vote. The National Rifle Association has strongly opposed the legislation, saying it could be used to persecute law-abiding gun owners. A 2009 report by the General Accounting Office said if Congress wants to ban firearm sales to suspected terrorists, it should require the Justice Department to establish guidelines to protect privacy and civil liberties. Wolf is open-minded to closing the ""terror gap"", but believes the thorny issues should be resolved in the Judiciary Committee, according to Dan Scandling, the congressman’s chief of staff. Scandling said the congressman’s vote against the bill reflected his dissatisfaction with the ""gotcha"" procedure of bringing it up in the Appropriations Committee.   Matthew Dennis, a spokesman for Rep. Lowey, said the congresswoman sidestepped the Committee because the it was killing ground for the legislation. ""Members of Congress who support closing this dangerous loophole have tried every avenue possible,"" he said. In 2011, Lowey offered an identical amendment in the Appropriations Committee that was defeated by a 27-18 vote with Wolf voting against it. An article in The Hill said Wolf offered to work Lowey to ""refine the amendment,"" but the congresswoman rejected his offer. The article said, ""Wolf said the amendment affected too many Americans since more than 500,000 people are on the terrorist list, according to the Justice Department. He noted that he regularly helps ordinary constituents get off the no-fly list after being put there by mistake."" A few final notes: Tom Culligan, Wolf’s legislative director, said the congressman supports the federal background check system and has voted to expand its funding. We should also mention that Wolf was endorsed by the NRA in last fall’s elections and received a B+ rating from the organization. Our ruling There’s no doubt that Wolf, sitting in the House Appropriations Committee, voted against an amendments to budget bills that would have allowed the attorney general to deny firearm sales to those suspected of abetting terrorism. Wolf had concerns that the legislation could trample the civil liberties of innocent people and objected to the procedure of bypassing Judiciary Committee -- a panel that has quashed similar bills since 2007. Mayors Against Illegal Guns goes a step further in saying Wolf ""voted to allow terror suspects to buy guns."" That’s an inflammatory statement that suggests Wolf put gun rights ahead of protecting the nation from terrorists. It ignores Wolf’s spurned offer in 2011 to work with the sponsor of the amendment to find a compromise that could keep guns away from suspected terrorists while protecting the rights of those who have been unfairly placed on the government’s watch list. So the mayors’ statement has accuracy, but omits important details about Wolf’s position. We rate it Half True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/06/mayors-against-illegal-guns/mayors-group-says-frank-wolf-voted-allow-terror-su/
"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'John Carter']","
John Carter claim that 40 percent of nation's illegal residents came by plane and overstayed visas draws on 2006 estimate
","A Texas congressman who took a three-day tour of the Rio Grande Valley near the Mexico border stressed afterward that many U.S. residents lacking legal permission to be here do not enter by tromping across the Rio Grande. Rep. John Carter, R-Round Rock, said: ""The reality is that about 40 percent of the people came in on an airplane, with a legal visa, and just overstayed their visa and have never gone home."" His comment appeared in a news story posted online by the Round Rock Leader on Aug. 31, 2013. Carter, who did not respond to our requests for elaboration, was referring to a well-known facet of illegal immigration. A July 2013 General Accountability Office report said: ""Each year, millions of visitors come to the United States legally on a temporary basis either with or without a visa. Overstays are individuals who were admitted legally on a temporary basis but then overstayed their authorized periods of admission."" PolitiFact researchers previously found substance to similar claims. In 2012, PolitiFact New Jersey said that according to most studies, visitors who overstayed visas ranged from about one-third to roughly half of all the country’s illegal immigrants. And relying largely on a 2006 study, PolitiFact in July 2010 rated as Mostly True a claim that 40 percent of the ""undocumented workers in this country"" entered the U.S. legally and ""overstayed their visa."" This is obviously an iffy topic and not just because quantifying the total number of illegal immigrants is tricky--they are, after all, evading detection. Of late, it’s widely estimated that 11 million U.S. residents are unauthorized to be here. According to the GAO, federal law requires the Department of Homeland Security to estimate the number of individuals overstaying their visas, though that has not occurred in recent years. In April 2011, the report said, Homeland Security officials said that they have not reported overstay rates because DHS has not had sufficient confidence in the quality of its overstay data. Also, the report says, then-Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano testified in early 2013 that the agency planned to report overstay rates by December 2013. If such a tally were available, it might reflect those individuals who checked in with immigration officials as they entered the country for whom authorities have no record of their checking out on departure. As of April 2013, Homeland Security had more than 1 million ""unmatched"" arrival records, the GAO report said, meaning those records were not accompanied by indications the individuals had left the country. The report said that some of the records reflected people overstaying their visas. The 40 percent statistic was floated as authoritative by several House members in a May 21, 2013, House subcommittee hearing, according to a transcript by CQ Transcriptions. Among them, Rep. Sheila Jackson Lee, D-Houston, asked James Dinkins, executive associate director for Immigration Customs Enforcement, to estimate how many of these ""millions of individuals"" likely pose security threats. Few, Dinkins replied, adding that the government had checked on about 480,000 names of potential new visa overstays that year. ""And of that 480,000 names, about 3,000 of them actually hit a potential national security or public safety threat,"" Dinkins said, with criminal cases opened on each one of the 3,000. On March 14, 2013, Edward Alden, a senior fellow on the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank, told a Senate committee: ""The commonly accepted estimate is that more than 40 percent of the unauthorized migrants currently resident in the United States did not cross the borders illegally. Instead, they arrived in the United States on a lawful tourist, student, business, or other visa and then violated the terms of that visa by remaining in the United States."" In a footnote, Alden pointed out that the Pew Hispanic Center issued a ""fact sheet"" in 2006 spelling out ""overstay"" estimates that have been deemed credible, a source also previously cited by PolitiFact. On the sheet, the center estimated that ""nearly half of all the unauthorized migrants now living in the United States entered the country legally through a port of entry such as an airport or a border crossing point where they were subject to inspection by immigration officials."" Specifically, the estimate ranged from 38 percent to 50 percent. The center split the difference by proposing a figure of up to 45 percent. Specifically, the center estimated, some 4.5 million to 6 million of the 11.5 million to 12 million unauthorized residents as of 2006 entered legally through ports of entry. The bulk of these entrants came in as tourists or as business visitors, the center said. According to the government, the center said, there were 179 million nonimmigrant admissions in 2004, meaning individual entries by foreigners authorized for temporary stays. The center said its estimate came from modifying a methodology devised by a government demographer who analyzed internal files in the 1990s to estimate the size and key characteristics of individuals who overstayed their visas. In 1997, the demographer, Robert Warren, concluded that the unauthorized migrant population totaled 5 million and that 2.1 million, or 41 percent, consisted of visa overstayers, according to the center, while Homeland Security later estimated that about one third of unauthorized residents in 2000 were visa overstayers and the GAO, drawing on alternate data sources, put the percentage of such overstayers at 27 percent, 31 percent and 57 percent. Of course, the data in the report, in addition to being estimates, are several years old, causing us to wonder what has changed. By email, Jeffrey Passel, the center’s senior demographer, told us the information has not been updated, though he also has seen ""no evidence of a significant change in the makeup of the resident unauthorized population in terms of method of arrival."" Of Carter’s focus on airplanes, Passel said: ""Not all of them ‘fly here,’ although most do. Some come through border ports of entry and some come by ship."" Alden noted in his testimony that while the government has fingerprinted each legal visitor since 2004, it has not taken an electronic approach to checking people heading home. (The Senate-approved immigration overhaul stipulates that electronic exit systems be implemented at all air and sea ports where immigration officers are present, according to a summary by the Immigration Policy Center, an arm of the American Immigration Council, which says its mission is to shape a rational conversation on immigration.) Yet Alden also said the ""scale of the problem may be exaggerated. In May 2011,"" he said, Napolitano ""ordered an investigation into nearly 1.7 million records of individuals that the department believed had overstayed"" since fingerprinting on entry started. The ""review determined,"" Alden said, ""that more than half of those had actually left the country or had adjusted status and were living in the United States legally."" On April 25, 2012, Napolitano testified to a Senate committee that people overstaying their visas may have been accounting for fewer than 40 percent of illegal immigrants. ""That may be a high number, because what we have found is a lot of people who were marked as visa overstays had, in fact, left,"" Napolitano said, according to a transcript. We did not draw any elaboration on her comment from Homeland Security. Next, we asked academic experts about Carter’s cited statistic. Gary Freeman, a University of Texas government professor, said by phone the 40 percent figure is ""widely used and rarely studied in any detail. You can’t say"" Carter is ""wrong,"" Freeman said, ""but we don’t know the right answer."" By email, Frank Bean, director of the Center for Research on Immigration, Population and Public Policy at the University of California-Irvine, suggested that because the cited percentage is rooted in data for the 1990s, it may well be low. ""Since then,"" Bean said, ""the pool of persons"" who are ""candidates to overstay their visas has grown immensely.  Even if the rate at which persons on visas overstay them has remained constant, the raw numbers of those doing so could have increased, and done so disproportionately enough to make the 40 percent figure rise.  Unfortunately, we have no way of estimating this with accuracy."" Our ruling Carter said about 40 percent of U.S. illegal immigrants ""came in on an airplane, with a legal visa, and just overstayed their visa and have never gone home."" That percentage aligns with an oft-repeated estimate, supported by a 2006 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, of the share of unauthorized residents who have overstayed visas. Many presumably arrived by plane, though we found no such breakdown. And the percentage could be off--too high or even too low. Homeland Security’s chief testified that 40 percent might be too high, while another expert told us there may now be more visitors who overstay. A precise up-to-date calculation doesn't seem to exist. We rate this claim, which relies on a seven-year-old estimate and could have used clarification about not all visitors coming by airplane, as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/06/john-carter/john-carter-claim-40-percent-nations-illegal-resid/
"['Georgia', 'Civil Rights', 'Criminal Justice', 'Jimmy Carter']","
Carter's numbers largely on target
","Former President Jimmy Carter joined tens of thousands of Americans last week to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington and its leader, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Carter reflected on the progress America has made since 1963 to achieve King’s dream of racial and economic equality. But Carter, a former Georgia governor, spoke about some issues he believes would pain King, a fellow Georgian. Carter said one trouble spot would be the number of African-American men in prison. Carter included some specifics that made us curious about whether they were accurate. ""I think we all know how Dr. King would have reacted to having more than 835,000 African-American men in prison, five times as many as when I left office,"" Carter told the massive crowd on the National Mall. Carter continued by saying about one-third of black men are ""destined to be in prison in their lifetimes,"" a statistic frequently cited in news reports. PolitiFact Georgia wondered whether the number of black men in prison had increased that much since Carter left the White House. We thought we’d do some research, considering the speech was broadcast live and Carter’s statistics have since been widely reported in various news outlets. When Carter left the White House in January 1981, the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics reported there were 160,442 black men in American prisons. That was nearly the same amount as the number of white men in prison (183,202), although at that time there were more than seven times as many white men as black men in the U.S. The number of black men in the United States increased by more than 45 percent between 1980 and 2010, U.S. Census figures show, from 12.5 million to 18.2 million. Their incarceration rates have been a constant subject of consternation and conversation among many civil rights activists, conservatives and criminologists. One often-repeated claim is that there are more black men in prison than in college. The most recent statistics suggest that assertion is false. Ivory Toldson, an associate professor at Howard University, talked about such claims earlier this year during an interview with NPR, citing numbers that support Carter’s claim concerning how many African-American men are currently in prison. Toldson pointed us to a table from a June 2010 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics report that said about 841,000 African-American men were in prison or in jail in 2009. An estimated 694,000 white men were in prison or jail that year. That is nearly four times the total number of white men in prison or jail  in 1981. Carter, too, based his claim on that report, said Steven Hochman, the director of research for the former president. Case closed? Not entirely. A BJS statistician cautioned us that the number of African-Americans in prison may be misleading as some inmates could be counted twice. For example, a person who served part of the year in jail and part of the year in prison might be counted as two inmates -- one while incarcerated in a local jail, another after a transfer to prison. At the end of 2011, the BJS reported about 555,300 African-American men in state and federal prisons. In 2011, the BJS reported that about 276,400 African-Americans were in local jails. There was no breakdown for how many prisoners in local jails were men. Typically, about 90 percent of incarcerated inmates, regardless of race, are men, BJS statistics show. We must also note another point. Many law enforcement officials will point out that there is a difference between a prison and a jail. ""Jails are designed to house people awaiting trial,"" said Terry Norris, executive director of the Georgia Sheriffs’ Association. Prisons, Norris said, were created to house people once they’re sentenced. Norris noted that some people still sit in county jails after being sentenced, due to a variety of issues, including prison overcrowding. In August, 6 percent of state-sentenced inmates were housed in county jails, according to numbers compiled by the Georgia Department of Community Affairs.  The percentage of state-sentenced inmates in county jails was as high as 13 percent in 2009. Norris believes the percentage will decrease in the future as a result of the state’s recent changes to the criminal justice system. Georgia has removed the mandatory minimum sentencing requirement in some limited cases involving nonviolent offenders. To sum up, Carter said in a speech that the number of African-American men in prison has increased fivefold since he left office in 1981. Carter would have been more accurate if he had said ""incarcerated""  instead of ""prison"" because his count included inmates in jail. In 1981, the number of black men incarcerated was about 160,000. A 2010 federal report said it was 841,000. Federal officials have cautioned that some of those inmates in the 2010 report may have been counted twice. The BJS reported that about 555,300 African-American men were in state and federal prisons as of 2011. That’s about 3.5 times as many as when Carter left office.  But if you add in jail inmates -- prisoners awaiting trial and serving sentences locally -- you approach Carter’s numbers. Carter’s overall point is that the number of African-American men incarcerated has increased substantially since he left office. He’s right about that. But you have to include some context to get the whole picture. We rate Carter’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/06/jimmy-carter/carter-cites-number-argue-kings-dream-not-reality/

Do special legislative sessions set Oregon back $40,000 each day?
","While Gov. John Kitzhaber has been considering whether he’ll call the Oregon Legislature back for a special session to look at further cuts to government pensions, some lawmakers are making their opinions known. Rep. Sal Esquivel, a Medford Republican, thinks a special session is a bad idea and wrote an opinion piece about it, which appeared in The Mail Tribune, a paper in southern Oregon. ""This sounds like a good idea and an admirable goal on the surface, but it also raises any number of questions,"" he wrote. ""The most important is obvious — why wasn’t this done during the five-month legislative session that we just adjourned?"" Esquivel lists a number of arguments, but one caught our attention straight away: ""Every day of a legislative session costs Oregon taxpayers $40,000. That includes paying staff, as well as per diem for legislators. And given the governor’s historically poor track record when it comes to special sessions, that is probably not the best use of our limited resources."" We vaguely remembered the last special session, when lawmakers convened to give Nike a tax break, but we didn’t remember the bill being so high, so we decided to check it out. First we looked through some of The Oregonian’s articles about the late 2012 special session to see what we’d reported as the cost as then. According to politics reporter Christian Gaston, the per-day cost (and it only lasted a day) of that session was $13,000. That’s a long way from what Esquivel quoted.  We shot Esquivel a quick email to see if he could point us toward his sources. The price, he said through a staffer, had come from the ""Legislative Finance Office."" We checked in with Sandra Rierson, the manager of the Financial Services department, who explained that the price depends on the kind of session you’re talking about. The cost per day of the longer regular sessions comes in at $34,901 a day but a special session is considerably less expensive at $13,000. Both numbers do not include the basic costs of keeping the Capitol running, which would get spent with or without lawmakers in the building. So why the difference? Given the short time frame of a special session, there aren’t nearly as many hires. ""We try to use existing staff as much as possible,"" Rierson said. We called Esquivel to get his response. He said he based the statement on numbers he’d been given years ago. ""I was told in the past by LFO that it was $36,000 per day and that was (six) years ago. I am assuming that that number did in fact go up so I concluded $40,000."" The figure we received, however, was the most recent average-per-day cost available from the finance department so we’re sticking with it. In an opinion piece arguing against a possible special legislative session, Esquivel said a legislative session costs $40,000 a day. In fact, it’s closer to $35,000, and that’s for regular legislative sessions. Esquivel, however, was making the argument against a special session. The cost per day for that comes in at a much lower $13,000. Because his opinion piece addresses special sessions in particular, there is no truth to his statement -- not to mention the fact that he didn’t use current numbers for regular sessions. We rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/05/sal-esquivel/do-special-sessions-set-oregon-back-40000-each-day/

Jim Jordan claims Obama health care decision ""exempted Congress and their staff from the full effect of the law""
","The U.S. Office of Personnel Management issued a rule on Aug. 7 that said members of Congress and their staffers ""will continue to have an employer contribution toward their health insurance premiums"" when they buy insurance through exchanges set up under the soon-to-be implemented Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. That greatly upset some foes of the law. Among them was Rep. Jim Jordan, a Republican from Champaign County in west-central Ohio, who wants the law repealed.  He issued an Aug. 8 news release titled ""Jordan Responds to President Obama’s Latest Healthcare Exemptions,""  which protested ""special treatment of Congressional staff under Obamacare"" as it urged delaying the law’s implementation. ""First the President delayed the employer mandate for a year, and now he has exempted Congress and their staff from the full effect of the law,"" Jordan’s statement said. Given that a highly publicized provision of the law requires members of Congress and their staffers to buy insurance through the exchanges, we wanted to examine Jordan’s claim that the new rule would exempt those people ""from the full effect of the law."" By way of background, Iowa Republican Sen. Charles Grassley devised the requirement as a political maneuver when the Senate Finance Committee drafted its version of the health care bill. He thought Democrats who controlled the committee would nix his idea so they wouldn’t have to participate in health insurance exchanges. Instead, they agreed and his provision became part of the law. The relevant part of the law states that:  ""Notwithstanding any other provision of the law, after the effective date of this subtitle, the only health plans that the Federal Government may make available to Members of Congress and Congressional staff with respect to their service as a Member of Congress or congressional staff shall be health plans that are - (I) created under this Act (or an amendment made by this Act); or (II) offered through an Exchange established under this Act (or an Amendment made by this Act). "" Because it goes on to define congressional staff as ""all full-time and part-time employees employed by the official office of a Member of Congress,""  people who work for Congress but not an individual Congress member - like employees of congressional committees - won’t  be required to buy their insurance on the exchanges. That provision makes Congress members and staffers in their personal offices the only employees of a large employer who will have to buy insurance through the exchanges, which were designed to make coverage available to people who must purchase insurance on their own, small businesses, and people who currently lack insurance. As Washington & Lee University health care law expert Timothy Jost noted, most Americans won’t buy insurance on the exchanges because they’ll continue to get insurance through their employer, or through government programs like Medicare and Medicaid. And many of those who do get insurance through the exchanges will qualify for federal subsidies to help reduce their costs. The law itself does not specify how Congress should move employees into the exchanges from their current  Federal Employees Health Benefits program insurance or whether they should be allowed to retain the employer co-pay they get toward their coverage. That co-pay is a significant amount of money. The Office of Personnel Management says the federal government typically pays between 72 and 75 percent of its employees’ health insurance premiums. Before OPM issued its proposed rule this month,  there was speculation that large numbers of congressional staffers would quit their jobs if  the co-pays were discontinued and they had to pay their entire health insurance premiums out of pocket. The newly issued rule states the government’s co-pay toward health plans bought on the exchange won’t be greater than the government’s contribution provided for other federally insured workers. It also says congressional employees on the exchanges won’t be eligible for premium tax credits for insurance bought on the exchanges, like other exchange participants who would be buying insurance on their own. The rule also permits each Congress member to determine which workers are employed by the ""official office,""  rather than the committees on which the Congress member serves, and thus would have to buy insurance from the exchanges. A fact sheet that OPM issued on the decision says that because the legal requirement that Congress members and staffers buy insurance from the exchanges is prefaced with the clause ""notwithstanding any other provision of law,""  the policy it is implementing ""is not subject to the rule in the Affordable Care Act that prohibits an employer from providing a qualified health plan through an exchange as a benefit under its cafeteria plan."" Jordan interpreted the law differently from OPM. He believes the letter of the law requires people to ""pay for their exchange plan on their own,""  and that Grassley’s amendment requires staffers to ""fully participate in the exchange by picking a plan, paying for it on their own, and perhaps qualifying for subsidies,"" said his press secretary, Meghan Snyder. ""The rule change will now allow Members and staff to receive a contribution from their employer toward the exchange plan, unlike other  Americans participating in the exchange,"" Snyder told us in an email. ""Further, members and staff will not qualify for the same subsidies as other Americans. Therefore, Members and staff are treated differently than the Americans who fully participate in the exchange."" Snyder said that the ""rule change reduced the cost of the plan for Members and staff by up to 75 percent and changed how the subsidies are applied as well. Those special exemptions, which apply only to Members of Congress and their staff, allows them relief from the full effects of the law."" She noted that articles written by Reuters and Bloomberg  made the same supposition about the law as Jordan. An April article from Bloomberg called the tax breaks that employers get for providing health insurance to their workers ""hugely inefficient"" and expressed the view that halting employer copays for congressional employees ""may make Congress inclined to save public and private money by restricting the subsidy for employer-provided coverage."" The August Reuters article said the health care law ""contained no language that allowed federal contributions"" toward congressional employees’ health care costs and said the OPM decision ""means that Congress will escape the most onerous impact of the law as it was written."" Other lawmakers - including Grassley - did not believe Grassley’s amendment would stop the federal government from paying part of congressional workers’ health insurance premiums.  When we asked Grassley’s office whether his legislative language was intended to force Congress members and staffers to pay all their insurance costs out-of-pocket, dramatically cutting their compensation in the process, it directed us to Senate report language on the Finance Committee bill that specified employer contributions could be used to pay for health exchange insurance purchases by Congress members and employees.   A 2010 Congressional Research Service report  on the issue also found the law  ""may provide authority for the federal government to make a contribution to the health insurance premiums of Members of Congress and congressional staff."" Washington & Lee University law professor Jost says the Congressional Research Service report shows ""the intent of Congress as to how coverage would be paid for was clear all along."" ""Congressional coverage would be paid for in the same way coverage for other federal employees is funded — through the federal Office of Personnel Management,"" Jost wrote on the Health Affairs blog.  ""The ACA requires the federal government to ‘make available’ exchange coverage to Congress, and Senator Grassley stated at the time he offered his amendment that its intent was ‘to require that Members of Congress and congressional staff get their employer-based health insurance through the same exchanges as … constituents.’ It was only a matter of time until OPM clarified this."" When we went through the 906-page law, we could not find anything that  would ban employer copays for insurance bought through the exchanges or that would ""require people to pay for their exchange plans on their own,""  as Jordan’s office said it did. Snyder did not respond to our request to point out those provisions in the law. Given that Jordan has one of the lowest staff turnover rates in the U.S. House of Representatives and presumably tries to be a fair employer, we also asked Snyder whether Jordan thought it would be fair to gut the compensation package that his staff receives by stopping the federal government from paying part of their insurance premiums. It seemed to us that halting a type of compensation offered by many major employers would single out Congress members and staffers for a raw deal that nobody else in the country would have suffered under the law. Snyder dismissed our question as ""largely hypothetic,"" since Jordan wants to repeal the law. ""Whether it be government handing out a ""raw deal"" or a ""special deal,"" it is still a law that treats members and their staff differently than the average American,"" she said. So where does Jordan’s claim rate on the Truth-O-Meter. There is a kernel of truth in it. We don’t dispute Jordan’s assertion that Congressional employees will get different treatment under the Affordable Care Act than some others who get their insurance from the exchanges. That’s due, in part, to Grassley’s provision makes Congressional offices the nation’s only large employer that will be required to buy insurance through exchanges designed to cover individuals without insurance and small employers. But while the Congressional employees will get an employer contribution toward their insurance, others in the exchanges will also be getting federal subsidies for their insurance. And Jordan's claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression and actually distorts some facts. Although Jordan says the  Affordable Care Act ‘s wording would require the federal government to discontinue the copay for Congress members and employees when they buy insurance through the exchange, the language of the law does not address that question. Authoritative sources like the Congressional Research Service and a Senate report on the health care bill long ago said the Affordable Care Act could allow continuing the employer copay for Congress members and their staffers. So while Congress and their staffs will be treated differently than some others getting health care coverage through the insurance exchanges, Jordan’s claim goes too far when he describes the Office of Personnel Management’s ruling on co-pays as one that ""exempted Congress and their staff from the full effect of the law."" Nothing in the law says that congressional employees should be required to pay the full freight for their health insurance. On the Truth-O-Meter, Jordan’s claim rates as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/sep/05/jim-jordan/jim-jordan-claims-obama-health-care-decision-exemp/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Bill Clinton']","
Bill Clinton says more Republicans than Democrats have signed up to stay on their parents' plans under Obamacare
","During a speech to support President Barack Obama’s health care law, former President Bill Clinton offered a juicy bit of polling data about one of the law’s provisions -- one that allows young Americans to remain on their parents’ health insurance policies up to the age of 26. He said more young Republicans are on their parents’ plans than young Democrats. Clinton, speaking at his presidential center in Little Rock, Ark., on Sept. 4, 2013, said the option to stay on a parent’s policy up to age 26 is a key element of Obama’s law, because it helps keep younger Americans covered. Some young people, presuming they won’t ever get sick, might otherwise be tempted to skip purchasing insurance coverage altogether. Clinton went on to cite data from recent polling by the Commonwealth Fund showing that ""large numbers of young people aged 26 and younger have already enrolled in their parents' plans. And interestingly enough -- if I were you guys, I'd promote this, (saying) these Republicans are the personal responsibility party -- there are more young Republicans enrolled in their parents' plans than young Democrats."" The irony that young supporters of the GOP -- the party that has repeatedly tried to repeal or defund Obama’s law -- are actually using this part of the law more than young Democrats are led to chuckles in the audience. We wondered: Is Clinton’s tidbit correct? We turned to the Commonwealth Fund study in question. The fund is a 95-year-old group that aims to ""promote a high-performing health care system that achieves better access, improved quality, and greater efficiency, particularly for society's most vulnerable, including low-income people, the uninsured, minority Americans, young children, and elderly adults."" The fund is nonpartisan but generally seen as supportive of Obama’s law. The fund conducted two polls of young Americans -- one taken in November 2011, the other taken in February and March 2013. Unlike traditional telephone polls, this survey uses Internet respondents drawn from a sample that, by design, closely mirrors the demographic patterns of the population at large. In 2013, the pollsters invited 3,530 adults aged 19 to 29 to complete the 2013 online questionnaire. More than half responded, producing a margin of sampling error of slightly more than 3 percentage points. Here’s a summary of what the pollsters found in 2013 when they asked whether a survey participant age 19 to 25 had, in the past 12 months, opted to stay on or enroll in their parents’ health plan:
  Party Yes, signed on to parents’ plan No, didn’t sign on to parents’ plan Democrats 45 55 Republicans 63 36 Independents 62 38 So, Clinton was right -- 63 percent of young Republicans, compared to only 45 percent of young Democrats had signed on to their parents’ plan, something they couldn’t have done without passage of Obama’s law. Sara R. Collins, vice president of Affordable Health Insurance for the Commonwealth Fund, provided us with some additional details about the survey. The survey included 1,001 respondents between 19 and 25 who were asked whether they consider themselves Republican, Democrat or Independent. Twenty-eight percent of respondents, or 285 people, considered themselves Democrats, while 26 percent, or 259 people, self-identified as Republicans. Because the question Clinton cited only concerned a portion of the people polled, the answers come with a higher margin of error than the overall poll. Collins said the Commonwealth Fund did not determine a sampling error for this specific question but found the results ""statistically significant."" Put another way, the results are reliable. ""President Clinton’s statement is accurate,"" Collins said. ""The difference between young adults who identify as Republicans and those who identify as Democrats enrolled on their parents' policies is statistically significant in the survey.  A greater share of young adults who identify themselves as Republicans are estimated to have enrolled on their parents' plans than did young adults who identified themselves as Democrats.""  For what it’s worth, the partisan variation was more pronounced in 2013 than it was in 2011. That year, respondents of all three partisan affiliations had much closer rates of signing up for a parent’s plan -- 50 percent of Democrats, 54 percent of Republicans and 55 percent of Independents. Our ruling Clinton said ""there are more young Republicans enrolled in their parents' (health insurance) plans than young Democrats."" Polling data from the Commonwealth Fund supports the claim. We rate the statement True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/05/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-more-republicans-democrats-have-/

Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz says there’s a ‘100-year-old international norm’ against use of chemical weapons
","What’s so special about chemical weapons? As President Barack Obama appeals to Congress to authorize a limited military strike against Syria, he has focused on intelligence that the country killed its own citizens in a chemical attack. Yet far more Syrians have died in the nation’s two-year-old civil war in other ways. What’s the difference? U.S. officials and lawmakers explain that there’s long-standing international agreement that chemical warfare simply isn’t okay. Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, for example, recently described a ""100-year-old international norm not to use chemical weapons."" Have the world’s nations opposed such weapons since the early 1900s? Taboo since before they were fully developed Wasserman Schultz, a South Florida congresswoman, explained the president’s position in an interview Sept. 2, 2013, with CNN’s Wolf Blitzer. He asked her why Obama sought congressional support to punish the Syrians when previous presidents had acted without lawmakers in Grenada, Panama, Somalia, Iraq, Yugoslavia and Libya. ""Why do you believe it’s necessary now?"" he asked. ""Well, let's be clear,"" she said. ""The president … does not believe that he is required to seek Congress' authorization."" Instead, she said, congressional authorization for a targeted strike would help Syrian leader Bashar Assad understand that ""his violation of a 100-year-old international norm not to use chemical weapons against either your own people or as a legitimate weapon of war will have a certain and severe response. And that he has to be held accountable for atrocities like that."" A hundred years ago, the world had yet to face the horrors of World War I, when nearly 100,000 people were killed by grenades and artillery shells loaded with chemicals like chlorine and mustard gas. Nor had they experienced the million casualties that followed from chemical attacks worldwide. Yet, it turns out, some international agreement against gas attacks predated the war — and even full development of the weapons themselves. An early ban Wasserman Schultz’s office sent us a declaration from world powers at an International Peace Conference at The Hague — dated 1899. It banned projectiles designed to spread ""asphyxiating or deleterious gases."" It was binding only among signing countries in the case of a war between two of them, and didn’t apply if a non-signing country jumped into the battle. It was worded as a limited agreement, not a moral condemnation. It came before general use of the weapons themselves. It was signed by more than two dozen countries, and ratified by all the major powers — except the United States. The American representative to the conference didn't agree to the declaration partly because he thought gas warfare, which had not yet been fully developed, was just as humane as other warfare, according to instructions to the American delegates and their official reports. But the Hague Declaration marked the start of international consensus on the topic, says Richard Price, a political scientist at the University of British Columbia who wrote a book called The Chemical Weapons Taboo. ""I think it's fair to say 'international norm' at that point,"" Price told PolitiFact. World War I was the first major test. Nations flunked. Fierce debate broke out over the reach of the ban, Price said, which restricted only projectiles, not all chemical warfare. Countries pointed fingers as thousands died in brutal chemical attacks in which victims choked and burned. Peace treaties, then the 1925 Geneva Conference, went much further than the Hague Declaration. World leaders in Geneva noted that ""the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous or other gases, and of all analogous liquids, materials or devices, has been justly condemned by the general opinion of the civilized world."" They wrote that prohibition of such weapons would be ""universally accepted as part of international law"" and appealed to the ""conscience"" of nations. The Geneva Protocol has since been ratified by 137 states, according to a white paper from the White House Office of Legislative Affairs provided by Wasserman Schultz’s office. But the United States, which pushed for the Geneva Protocol, didn't ratify it until 1975. Since then, chemical attacks have been rare, with just a few notable exceptions — such as Iraq’s use of them in the 1980s against Iran. Those attacks, it turned out, took place with American support. Syria, by the way, was among countries in agreement against chemical weapons, ratifying the Geneva Protocol in 1968. But Syria has been less cooperative since then, as one of the only holdouts to 1992’s Chemical Weapons Convention. (The United States actually ratified that one.) That agreement to entirely eliminate chemical weapons ""for the sake of all mankind"" includes 189 nations that represent about 98 percent of the world’s population, according to the United Nations. It may not be binding law for Syria, but it certainly represents an international norm, Price says. Our ruling Wasserman Schultz mentioned on CNN a ""100-year-old international norm not to use chemical weapons."" An international peace conference at The Hague before World War I did take up the use of chemical weapons, limiting their use between world powers more than 100 years ago. But disagreement about whether their use was humane led the American representative to hold out. Backlash after atrocities during World War I led to even broader international condemnation in 1925, nearly 90 years ago. Yet there weren't votes in the U.S. Senate to ratify that agreement until the 1970s. Now most of the world agrees such weapons ought to be eliminated entirely. But it was a long slog to get there. World powers did reach some international agreement against chemical weapons more than 100 years ago, though the context requires some clarification. We rate Wasserman Schultz’s claim Mostly True. CLARIFICATION: This article was updated to reflect that though gas projectiles hadn't been fully developed for practical use at the time of the Hague Declaration, some use of chemicals as weapons predated the 1899 agreement. Also, Syria didn't ratify the Geneva Protocol until 1968.",/factchecks/2013/sep/05/debbie-wasserman-schultz/rep-debbie-wasserman-schultz-says-theres-100-year-/

Republican National Committee says health insurance premiums have risen 29 percent under Barack Obama
","Just hours before former President Bill Clinton was to give a speech promoting President Barack Obama’s health care law, the Republican National Committee sent a pre-emptive tweet critical of Obama’s stewardship of health care. The Sep. 4, 2013, tweet said, ""The average family premium has increased by 29% under Obama!"" The tweet offered the link to a new RNC website, obamacarecosts.org, and added the hashtag ""#Obamacosts."" Is the tweet’s claim correct? We turned to the leading study of family premiums, an independent, nonpartisan study published annually since 1999 by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research & Educational Trust. The study looks at health premium costs for workers and their employers. The 2008 study -- the last one completed before Obama took office -- found that the average family premium for employer-sponsored health insurance was $12,680. By the time of the 2013 study, that amount had risen to $16,351. That’s an increase of 29 percent -- exactly as the RNC’s tweet had said. That’s well above the rate of inflation overall, which was about 8 percent during that period. Since health coverage premiums provided through a job are typically split between the employee and the employer, the studies also provided a breakdown of who paid what. This data showed that the employee share of premiums actually rose even faster over that period -- 36 percent. So the RNC’s numbers are sound. But we’ll also point out some missing context: The rate of increase between 2008 and 2013 was significantly lower than it was between 1999 and 2008. From 2008 to 2013, premiums rose by an average of 5.8 percent per year. But between 1999 and 2008, premiums rose by an average of 13.2 percent a year -- in other words, twice as fast as premiums rose under Obama. So, contrary to the tweet’s implication that Obama has presided over runaway health care costs, premiums are actually increasing less quickly than previously. How much does that context undercut the tweet? That’s a matter of opinion. Jon Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who advised both Obama and then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney on health care policy, said that the RNC’s fact ""is right, but that is actually good news, not bad news."" Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, agreed that it’s a reasonable bit of context. He acknowledged there are ""differences of opinion"" on why premiums are growing more slowly, including larger economic trends, long-term trends in health care and policies instituted under Obama’s law. However, Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush, cautioned against placing too much weight on the historical trends. ""Premiums rose,"" she said. ""The most relevant point is that Obama and his advisers repeatedly and publicly said premiums would fall by the end of his first term if the ACA was passed. Instead, they rose."" Indeed, we have previously given Obama a Promise Broken for his pledge to ""cut the cost of a typical family's premium by up to $2,500 a year."" Wilensky added that Obama may ultimately have been lucky in his timing. ""Health care prices has been increasing unusually slowly for the last few years,"" she said. ""How much of that is carry-over from the deep recession is unknown."" Whether or not premiums grow more slowly over the long term, she said, will become clearer once the economy recovers more fully and puts upward pressure on prices. Our ruling The RNC said ""the average family premium has increased by 29% under Obama!"" The leading study confirms that rise, which occurred over the course of five years. If you calculate the increases on an annual basis, premiums have risen by about 5.8 percent a year under Obama, which is less than half of the average annual rise during the nine years before Obama took office. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/04/republican-national-committee-republican/republican-national-committee-says-health-insuranc/

Rep. Peter King says Bill Clinton continued Kosovo air campaign after rebuke by House
","Congress is about to debate whether the U.S. should act militarily in Syria in the wake of suspected usage of chemical weapons by the regime of Bashar Assad. After initially sending signals that the military might strike before waiting for approval by Congress, the Obama administration ultimately decided to ask for congressional approval. This set up the possibility that President Barack Obama might feel pressed to pursue military action even in the face of a congressional rejection. And because the NATO air campaign in Kosovo in the late 1990s proceeded along similar lines, the Kosovo experience quickly became a part of the discussion of Syria. On the Aug. 1, 2013, edition of Fox News Sunday, Rep. Peter King, R-N.Y., said, ""The House did vote against engagement in Kosovo, and Bill Clinton kept fighting anyway. And, then, ultimately, a vote did pass. But he had bombing missions being carried in Kosovo after the House of Representatives voted against him taking action."" King is a senior Republican on the House Homeland Security Committee and the House Intelligence Committee. Is King right that there is precedent for a president carrying out military action even after the House specifically voted against authorizing such action? First, some background. The Kosovo conflict erupted in the 1990s between two groups within the former Yugoslavia -- Kosovars, who are primarily ethnic Albanians, and Serbs, who are of Slavic descent. The two groups have long disputed the territory known as Kosovo, and after greater Yugoslavia fractured in the early 1990s, the dispute over Kosovo became violent, pitting the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army against the Serb-dominated government of what remained of Yugoslavia. Seeking to prevent casualties like those that had proliferated in Bosnia between 1992 and 1995, NATO -- the military alliance of the United States and western Europe -- edged in 1998 and 1999 toward action against the Serbs, who it viewed as the aggressors. NATO initiated airstrikes on March 24, 1999, a campaign that would continue for the better part of three months, until agreements were reached for Serb forces to withdraw, for the Kosovo Liberation Army to disarm and for refugees to return home. In 2008, Kosovo declared independence; 100 countries have recognized it, and it has joined the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. However, despite ongoing negotiations by the United Nations and other international officials, its final status remains unresolved. Did the House reject Clinton over Kosovo? During his second term as president, Clinton pressed Congress to authorize NATO military action in Kosovo. On March 23, 1999, the Senate, by a 58-41 vote, passed a non-binding authorization of force. The Senate resolution backed ""military air operations and missile strikes in cooperation with our NATO allies against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro)."" That’s short of a declaration of war -- the method outlined in the Constitution -- but it is similar to what other presidents have sought, and usually received, from Congress in recent decades when they wish to pursue military efforts abroad. (In this article, we take a closer look at the differences between post-World War II declarations of war and authorizations for the use of military force.) The day after the Senate passed this resolution, NATO bombing commenced. But the House of Representatives did not vote on the Senate-passed resolution until more than a month later. On April 28, 1999, the House took up several pieces of legislation on Kosovo. By a 249-180 vote, the House prevented any Defense Department funds from being used on a ground campaign. Meanwhile, by a 139-290 vote, the House defeated an effort to remove U.S. armed forces from the Kosovo conflict. A more traditional declaration of war failed by an even larger margin -- 2 votes for, 427 against. But the most important legislation -- and the one directly relevant to judging King’s claim -- was the Senate resolution that authorized air and missile strikes against the Serbs. It failed the House in a rare tie vote, 213-213. The vote was a stinging rebuke to Clinton, and an embarrassment to House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill., who backed a president from the opposite party. The defections were mixed -- 31 Republicans supported Clinton’s request while 26 Democrats voted against it. The New York Times, which called the debate ""heated and sometimes anguished,"" reported that White House spokesman Jake Siewert brushed off the House vote. ""The House today voted no on going forward, no on going back and they tied on standing still,"" Siewert said. ""We will continue to prosecute the air campaign and to stop the violence being perpetrated by (Serb leader Slobodan) Milosevic."" Indeed, NATO continued airstrikes the following day and for about two months after the failed House vote. Did the House eventually reverse course and authorize the campaign? By saying that ""ultimately, a vote did pass,"" King suggested that the House did ultimately authorize force in Kosovo. But whether that’s true is not as settled as the first part of his claim. On May 20, 1999, the House passed an emergency appropriations bill that funded the Kosovo campaign. By funding military activities that were already under way, the spending bill can be seen as a way for Congress to tacitly back the Kosovo campaign, even though the bill did not explicitly use language that authorized the war. Norman Ornstein, a longtime Congress watcher, said King phrased his statement broadly enough to be accurate. In addition, Ornstein said, it was a narrowly targeted emergency spending bill, rather than an ""omnibus"" bill funding potentially hundreds of programs. That suggested to him that it’s ""a direct vote on continuing to bomb,"" he said. Other experts say ""not so fast."" The War Powers Resolution, passed in the wake of the Vietnam War, was intended to stop presidents from fighting wars without input from Congress. Under the War Powers Resolution, a president can initiate military action but must receive approval from Congress to continue the operation within 60 days. Presidents from both parties have regularly ignored the law, and Congress has often been reluctant to assert itself. But it remains on the books. As it happens, section 8(a)(1) of the resolution addresses the question of whether a spending bill constitutes authorization. It says, ""Authority to introduce United States Armed Forces into hostilities or into situations wherein involvement in hostilities is clearly indicated by the circumstances shall not be inferred … from any provision of law … including any provision contained in any appropriation Act, unless such provision specifically authorizes the introduction of United States Armed Forces into hostilities … and stating that it is intended to constitute specific statutory authorization within the meaning of this joint resolution."" That would suggest that approving spending does not equal authorization. But to make things even more complicated, there is some case law (particularly the 1973 case Mitchell v. Laird) suggesting that appropriations measures might be sufficient as to infer authorization, said Anthony Clark Arend, professor of government and foreign service at Georgetown University. Our ruling King said that ""the House did vote against engagement in Kosovo, and Bill Clinton kept fighting anyway. And, then, ultimately, a vote did pass."" King is right that the House failed to pass an authorization for military action in Kosovo, and that Clinton continued to pursue the air campaign despite the legislative setback. However, it’s not a slam dunk that ""ultimately, a vote did pass."" The House did pass a spending bill covering the costs of the Kosovo campaign, but not an authorization along the lines of what is required by the War Powers Resolution. On balance, we rate the statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/sep/04/peter-king/rep-peter-king-says-bill-clinton-continued-kosovo-/
