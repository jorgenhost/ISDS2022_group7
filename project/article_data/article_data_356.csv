Cruz is right in back-and-forth with Rubio about vote on defense spending
","Sen. Ted Cruz said a string of rival Sen. Marco Rubio’s attacks at the Republican presidential debate in South Carolina were ""flat-out false."" One attack pinpointed Cruz’s record on military spending. ""The only budget you have ever voted for, Ted, in your entire time in the Senate is a budget for (Sen.) Rand Paul that brags about how it cuts defense,"" Rubio said. Cruz shook his head and said Rubio knowingly made an inaccurate claim. ""The attack he keeps throwing out on the military budget. Marco knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion,"" Cruz said. ""What he said, and he said it in the last debate, is simply not true."" Rubio has criticized Cruz’s record on military spending before, as Cruz voted for a proposed Paul budget that would have resulted in lower defense spending than current projections. But on his specific point about voting for Rubio’s amendment, Cruz is right. (We're not fact-checking whether Rubio ""knows full well"" about Cruz's vote.) Trying to counteract defense spending cuts over the past few years, Rubio put forth an amendment to increase military spending in March 2015. If passed, the amendment would have raised projected defense spending outlays through 2022 in Congress’ proposed budget. Cruz voted for the amendment. The measure failed 32-68. Cruz mentioned $697 billion, specifically, but it’s a little unclear exactly how much Rubio’s amendment would increase spending. On the Senate floor, Rubio said defense funds should reflect the Department of Defense’s 2012 fiscal year request, which projected $611 billion in spending in 2016. But Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., who backed the amendment, said it would increase military spending to $697 billion. The very same day, the Senate voted on a Paul amendment that would have increased military spending to a similar level as the Rubio amendment, but it offset those costs with cuts to education, research and more. Cruz and Rubio both voted against the amendment, and it failed 4-96. Our ruling Cruz said Rubio ""knows full well I voted for his amendment to increase military spending to $697 billion."" Cruz did indeed vote for a failed Rubio amendment that would have increased military spending after years of spending cuts.  While the amendment didn’t specifically say spending would be increased to $697 billion, that figure was part of the discussion among the bill’s proponents. Cruz’s point is right on, so we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2016/jan/15/ted-cruz/gop-debate-cruz-says-he-voted-rubio-defense-spendi/

Did former Attorney General Eric Holder say he viewed his mission as 'brainwashing' against guns?
","During the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, re-litigated the background of President Barack Obama’s former attorney general, Eric Holder. One of the debate moderators, Maria Bartiromo of Fox Business Network, asked Cruz for ""the answer"" to stopping mass shootings and violent crime. ""The answer is simple,"" he said. ""You prosecute criminals. You target the bad guys. You know, a minute ago, (co-debate moderator Neil Cavuto) asked, ‘What has President Obama done to illustrate that he wants to go after guns? Well, he appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns. He appointed Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court, someone who has been a radical against the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms."" We raised our eyebrows at Cruz’s mention of Holder and what he said. Is Cruz right? Let’s go to the videotape from back in 1995, a time when there really were such things as videotapes. In January 1995, Holder -- then the U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia -- gave a speech announcing a plan to curb gun violence in the city of Washington, D.C. Here’s a portion of the speech, recorded by C-SPAN. ""What we need to do is change the way in which people think about guns, especially young people, and make it something that’s not cool, that it’s not acceptable, it’s not hip to carry a gun anymore, in the way in which we changed our attitudes about cigarettes,"" Holder said. He later added, ""We have to be repetitive about this. It’s not enough to have a catchy ad on a Monday and then only do it Monday. We need to do this every day of the week, and just really brainwash people into thinking about guns in a vastly different way."" So there’s video proof that Holder did indeed say what Cruz said he did. That said, we’ll offer two caveats. First, the way Cruz phrased his statement might lead listeners to believe that Holder had talked about ""brainwashing"" during his tenure as attorney general or shortly before he was nominated by Obama for the post. That’s not the case -- the remark in question came a full 14 years earlier. Second, Cruz leaves out the context in which Holder was speaking. As the top federal law enforcement official for the District of Columbia, Holder was speaking at a very particular time about a very particular place. At the time, drug-related crime and gun murders in Washington were a serious concern, both locally and nationally. A few years before, D.C. had been dubbed the ""murder capital of the world."" In other portions of the speech, Holder can be heard referring specifically to youth violence in the nation’s capital and referencing local officials such as once-and-future mayor Marion Barry. This D.C. focus by Holder is supported by a Jan. 13, 1995, Washington Post article that preceded the speech but which laid out a general overview of Holder’s initiative. ""U.S. Attorney Eric H. Holder Jr. said yesterday he is completing the details of a massive law enforcement effort to get guns off Washington's streets,"" the article says. ""It will target people carrying and selling firearms in the city's most violent neighborhoods."" In addition to tougher law enforcement, Holder was proposing efforts to change "" ‘romanticized’ perceptions about guns and violence, especially among young black men."" Holder -- the first African American to serve as U.S. attorney in Washington -- was planning to unveil the speech on Martin Luther King Jr.’s birthday. ""As a people, did we fight, did we sacrifice, did we die simply to inherit and then bequeath to our children this kind of America where crimes run rampant and fears stalk our citizens?"" Holder wrote in a draft of the speech, according to the Post. Holder told the Post that the goal of the effort was designed to reduce violence in Washington by the end of the decade to levels prior to 1986, when crack cocaine sent homicides and shootings soaring. ""I believe that if you can really change the way young people, especially young black men, view the possession and use of guns ... you can have a significant impact on the quality of life in this city,"" Holder told the Post. This is a nuance that Cruz’s statement ignores. Our ruling Cruz said Obama ""appointed Eric Holder as attorney general. Eric Holder said he viewed his mission as brainwashing the American people against guns."" Holder unquestionably said the word ""brainwash."" But Cruz leaves out some important context -- how long ago the comment was made, and the fact that it was targeted toward youth during a high-crime era in Washington, D.C., not the overall American public.

Chris Christie says 'I didn’t support Sonia Sotomayor' -- but he did
","Marco Rubio tried to cast fellow GOP presidential candidate Chris Christie as a liberal on many topics, including the appointment of Supreme Court justice Sonia Sotomayor. During the South Carolina debate Jan. 14, Rubio said that Christie endorsed many of the ideas that President Barack Obama supports, ""whether it is Common Core, or gun control, or the appointment of Sonia Sotomayor, or the donation he made to Planned Parenthood."" Christie shot back, ""Let’s get the facts straight. First of all, I didn’t support Sonia Sotomayor."" He then continued to dispute the rest of Rubio’s statement. We decided to focus on the part about the Supreme Court justice. Who is right? Did Christie support Sotomayor or not? Sotomayor Sotomayor, a U.S. Court of Appeals judge, was Obama’s first Supreme Court nominee and the country’s first Hispanic justice. She was confirmed by the Senate on Aug. 6, 2009, in a 68-31 vote. The Rubio campaign did not respond to our inquiry about the claim, but we tracked down some of Christie’s statements through his campaign and news coverage. In 2009, Christie was running for governor in New Jersey, so he didn’t get to vote on her appointment or play any role in her vetting by the Senate. But he did make a series of statements about her in 2009 that a Christie campaign spokeswoman sent to us. It’s not surprising that Christie -- a former federal prosecutor -- was asked to weigh in about a Supreme Court candidate who was from New York and went to college at Princeton in New Jersey. In a radio debate May 27, 2009, Christie was asked: ""Would you have appointed her or even considered her for a top appointment to the bench?"" Christie responded, ""She wouldn’t have been my choice, no."" When asked to elaborate, Christie said, ""Well, no, I mean listen, that’s the question. She wouldn’t have been my choice. Absolutely not. Not my kind of judge. "" But two months later, he made comments that showed some support for her confirmation -- although he again said that Sotomayor would not have been his choice. ""After watching and listening to Judge Sotomayor's performance at the confirmation hearings this week, I am confident that she is qualified for the position of associate justice of the U.S. Supreme Court,"" said Christie, a former federal prosecutor, according to Politicker New Jersey. ""Elections have consequences. One of those consequences are judicial appointments. While Judge Sotomayor would not have been my choice, President Obama has used his opportunity to fill a seat on the Supreme Court by choosing a nominee who has more than proven her capability, competence and ability."" He continued: ""I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination. Qualified appointees should be confirmed and deserve bipartisan support. Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito deserved that support based on their work as Circuit Court Judges. So does Judge Sotomayor. As a result, I support her confirmation. This is a historic moment and her inspiring success story should not only make the Latino community proud, but all Americans."" Our ruling Christie said, ""I didn’t support Sonia Sotomayor."" When Sotomayor was nominated by Obama, Christie said in May 2009,  ""She wouldn’t have been my choice, no."" But two months later, Christie said that she had ""more than proven her capability, competence and ability,"" adding, ""I support her appointment to the Supreme Court and urge the Senate to keep politics out of the process and confirm her nomination."" Christie’s statement that he didn’t support Sotomayor misrepresents his eventual position.

Here's what's wrong with Jeb Bush saying Hillary Clinton is under FBI investigation
","Editor's note: Since this story published, more information has come to light about the FBI investigation into Hillary Clinton's email setup. Read an updated article here. If Hillary Clinton becomes president, she might find herself preoccupied with an FBI investigation, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said at a Republican presidential debate in South Carolina. ""She’s under investigation with the FBI right now,"" Bush said Jan. 14. ""If she gets elected, her first 100 days — instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the court house."" Actually, Clinton is not under FBI investigation. The inquiry to which Bush refers revolves around the private email server Clinton used while serving as secretary of state.  And it is not a criminal investigation. Here are the facts. In July 2015, the Inspector General of the Intelligence Community sent what is called a security referral to members of the executive branch. A security referral is essentially a notification that classified information might exist in a location outside of the government’s possession. In this case, the location was Clinton’s private email server. Soon after, the New York Times incorrectly reported that the inspectors general requested a criminal investigation into Clinton’s email use — as opposed to a security referral. But the newspaper later issued two corrections. The referral was in connection with Clinton’s account, not whether Clinton herself mishandled information, and did not allege criminal activity. Officials told reporters at the time that the FBI was not targeting Clinton specifically. As part of its inquiry, the FBI has looked into the security setup for Clinton’s home server and a thumb drive that has copies of Clinton’s work emails. But most details of the investigation have remained secret. It’s even unclear at this point whether the FBI probe is just a preliminary inquiry or if it has evolved into a true investigation, according to Politico. Describing the inquiry, FBI Director James Comey told Congress in October 2015, ""The FBI is working on a referral given to us by inspectors general in connection with former Sec. Clinton’s use of a private email server."" He declined to give any more specifics. Earlier this month, Fox News reported that the FBI was broadening its investigation to look into whether any connection between the State Department under Clinton and the nonprofit Clinton Foundation violated public corruption laws. Clinton denied that FBI was pursuing this line of inquiry. However, Fox bases its report on unnamed sources, so we cannot independently verify it, nor have any major media outlets. Bush’s campaign and the FBI did not respond to our requests for comment in time for publication. Our ruling Bush said Clinton is ""under investigation with the FBI right now."" Not quite. The FBI is conducting a general inquiry into the security of Clinton’s private email server. But law enforcement officials have said Clinton herself is not the target of the inquiry, and it is not a full-blown criminal investigation. Clinton’s actions are clearly front-and-center in an FBI investigation. But Bush goes too far to claim Clinton herself is under investigation.

Ted Cruz says U.S. has 'lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977'
","During the Republican presidential debate in North Charleston, S.C., Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, took aim at the nation’s economic record under President Barack Obama. ""The millionaires and billionaires are doing great under Obama,"" Cruz said. ""But we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977. Median wages have stagnated. And the Obama-Clinton economy has left behind the working men and women of this country."" We decided to fact-check Cruz’s statement that we have the lowest percentage of Americans working today since 1977. Cruz is on to something. One key employment statistic known as the civilian labor force participation rate is at its lowest level since the 1970s. This statistic takes the number of Americans in the labor force -- basically, those who are either employed or who are seeking employment and divides it by the total civilian population. Here’s a chart going back to the mid 1970s.  When the civilian labor force participation rate is low, it’s a concern, because it means there are fewer working Americans to support non-working Americans. But we’ll offer two asterisks for Cruz’s statement. First, as we’ve noted before, a notable factor in the decline of the labor-force participation rate is the aging of the Baby Boom generation. As more adults begin moving into retirement age, the percentage of Americans who work is bound to decline. When we last looked at this question in 2013, Gary Burtless, a Brookings Institution economist, told us he had estimated that the labor-force participation rate would have fallen in recent years on the basis of aging alone. That said, Cruz has a point that the recession exacerbated that decline. In a weak job market, some people who might otherwise want a job may return to school, become full-time parents or retire early. Second, there’s another way to read Cruz’s words. He said ""the lowest percentage of Americans working"" since 1977, which could also refer to a different statistic, the employment-population ratio. This statistic takes the number of people who are employed and divides it by the civilian population age 16 and above. The difference in this case is that using the employment-population ratio, Cruz’s statement is incorrect. Unlike the labor-force participation rate, the employment-population ratio has actually been improving in recent years, although it’s below its pre-recession highs. Here’s a chart showing this statistic over the same time frame:  If you exclude the Great Recession, the employment-population ratio was last at its current rate in 1984, not 1977.  So by that measurement, he’s close. Our ruling Cruz said, ""We have the lowest percentage of Americans working today of any year since 1977."" He’s put his finger on a trend that worries economists of all stripes, but his wording was sloppy. In addition, it’s worth remembering that this particular trend is being driven at least to a degree by demographic trends beyond the control of any president.

Donald Trump's false claim that refugees, migrants are mostly 'strong, powerful men'
","Donald Trump repeated a false notion Thursday at the South Carolina Republican debate that the flight of Syrian refugees and other migrants is largely men. Trump was asked by Fox Business moderator Neil Cavuto about his proposal to ban Syrian refugees and others from entering the United States. Trump rattled off incidents around the world, including in Indonesia and France, and said that migration could be a ""great Trojan Horse."" ""When I looked at the migration, when I looked at the line … where are the women?"" Trump said. ""There look like very few women. Very few children. Strong, powerful men. Young. And people are looking at that and saying, ‘What’s going on?’ "" Trump made a similar claim in October. It was False then, and it’s False now. We asked Trump’s campaign for more information about his claim but did not hear back. However, there are two databases that track the movements of migrants in Europe and Syrian refugees. Neither supports his statement. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees registers and tracks Syrian refugees in camps spread over several nations, including Turkey, Lebanon, Jordan, Iraq and North African countries. According to numbers as of Dec. 31, 2015, the total comes to more than 4.6 million. Of those 4.6 million, 50.7 percent are female and 51.8 percent are children (boys and girls) 17 years old or younger. So the majority of refugees are: 1. Women; 2. 17 or younger. In all, only 22.7 percent of refugees across the Middle East and North Africa being counted by the U.N. were men older than 18. Looking at the migrant crisis more broadly only slightly helps Trump’s case. The U.N. also tracks so-called ""sea arrivals,"" refugees and migrants who cross the Mediterranean Sea to continental Europe. The counts a little more than 1 million people who have crossed into Europe since the start of 2015, with almost 3,800 dying during the journey. The U.N. breaks those migrants into three categories: Adult men, 49 percent; Adult women, 19 percent; and children, 31 percent. Our ruling Trump said that among Syrian refugees and migrants coming into Europe, ""there look like very few women. Very few children."" The data in no way supports that claim. The majority of more than 4.6 million Syrian refugees entering Europe are women and children 17 and younger. Of migrants arriving by sea -- about 1 million people -- 31 percent are children and 19 percent are women.

Barack Obama says U.S. has 'strongest, most durable economy in the world' during State of the Union
","President Barack Obama presented a range of statistics designed to show his economic record in a positive light during his 2016 State of the Union address. He kicked it off with this assertion: ""The United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world."" A reader asked us to fact-check this after hearing a similar claim by Obama in an interview with Matt Lauer in the run-up to the State of the Union. So we took a closer look.  We should note up front that many of the experts we checked with considered Obama’s claim to be vague and difficult to prove. ""This is the type of braggadocio statement that is hard to interpret in a rigorous way,"" said Barry Bosworth, an economist at the Brookings Institution. However, many of the same experts agreed that if you had to choose one country for the title of ""strongest, most durable economy in the world,"" it would be the United States. White House evidence: GDP and jobs When we asked the White House for their evidence, a spokeswoman said the United States is the world’s largest economy at current market exchange rates. Also, she added, the United States’ gross domestic product -- the sum of all economic activity -- is up by a cumulative 9.7 percent since the first quarter of 2008. That’s about twice as fast as the increase in other industrialized economies, according to a data collected by Haver Analytics from International Monetary Fund and World Bank figures. The White House also pointed to strong job growth. Since 2010, the United States has added as many jobs as all the rest of the advanced economies combined, according to Haver data. (We have rated Half True a claim by Obama in his 2015 State of the Union address, that ""since 2010, America has put more people back to work than Europe, Japan, and all advanced economies combined."" We found that Obama was correct on the numbers but ignored persistent declines in the labor force participation rate.) How fast will world economies grow in 2016 and 2017? Experts told us that these two statistics -- gross domestic product and employment -- are reasonable ones to use as evidence for Obama’s claim, so we took a fresh look at the data. We interpreted Obama’s phrases -- ""right now"" and ""the strongest, most durable economy"" -- to suggest a focus on what’s happening now and into the immediate future, rather than looking at past growth rates. We turned to projections for GDP growth over the next two years released by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a group of economically advanced countries. The group looked at 43 countries, ranging from large, advanced economies to smaller, advanced economies to large, emerging economies. The United States ranked almost exactly in the middle of the OECD’s list -- No. 21. Experts told us, however, that a middling ranking on this list doesn’t necessarily mean the United States’ economic outlook is weak. (The full chart is at the end of this article, ranked in descending order by projected GDP growth in 2016). For starters, many of the countries with higher projected growth rates have significantly smaller economies, making a comparison with the United States apples-to-oranges. These countries include Ireland, Iceland, the Slovak Republic, Poland, Israel, Latvia, Luxembourg, Lithuania and Estonia. In addition, a few countries have much higher projected growth rates, but they are generally considered emerging economies, making for a different but equally questionable type of apples-to-oranges comparison. These include the top three countries on the projected-growth list: India, China and Indonesia. ""Many developing and emerging market countries will surpass the United States in terms of GDP growth, but that's not really a fair comparison,"" said Jon Hoddenbagh, an assistant professor of international economics at Johns Hopkins University. ""It's easier to ‘catch up’ in productivity when you are well below the technological frontier, and more difficult to grow at the technological frontier itself, which is where the United States and other advanced economies find themselves.""   Meanwhile, the recent financial wobbliness in China doesn’t exactly bode well for it being considered ""durable"" despite its rapid GDP growth in recent years. China’s troubles in turn have slowed growth in other emerging-market countries, especially commodity exporters like Brazil and Russia. The United States vs. its G7 rivals The most direct comparisons to the United States are probably the other six members of the elite Group of 7 economies — the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada and Japan. And all of them rank below the United States when measured by projected growth for 2016 and 2017. As for employment, the United States scores well among its closest competitors. Hoddenbagh pointed to data showing only one of the Group of 7 with a lower unemployment rate than the United States’ current 5 percent. Japan’s unemployment rate is 3.3 percent. ""There are small countries like Singapore and Denmark that have even lower unemployment rates, but an unemployment rate of 5 percent is considered near the full employment level,"" Hoddenbagh said. ""Relative to other large advanced economies, the U.S. economy is in a good position."" Hoddenbagh added that the the strength of the U.S. dollar against most other major currencies indicates the relative strength of the U.S. economy compared to other advanced, industrialized nations. He noted that the Trade-Weighted U.S. Dollar Index is at its highest level since 2003. Germany has been an economic bulwark for Europe. But while Germany has a lower debt-to-GDP ratio than the United States does, it’s also grappling with a higher unemployment rate, greater risks from the economic weakness of its European neighbors, and a larger-scale challenge than the United States in integrating refugees into its population, Hoddenbagh said. ""I find it a stretch to argue Germany is leaps and bounds ahead of the United States economically,"" he said. ""Relative to the weak performance of many other countries, the U.S. economy doesn't look so bad."" Other experts agreed that Obama’s proposition is reasonable. Obama’s comment ""should be regarded as substantially correct,"" said Simon Johnson, a professor of entrepreneurship at the MIT Sloan School of Management. Our ruling Obama said that ""the United States of America, right now, has the strongest, most durable economy in the world."" It’s a claim that’s vague and hard to assess, but when comparing the United States to the most advanced economies in the world, one can make a credible case that the United States is in the strongest position, at least ""right now.""

Marco Rubio super PAC says Chris Christie imposed an Internet tax in New Jersey
","New Jersey's Republican governor and presidential candidate Chris Christie is under attack for his tax policies by the Conservative Solutions PAC, a political action committee that supports GOP Sen. Marco Rubio for the presidency. It is not directly tied to the Rubio campaign. In a 30-second TV commercial, the super PAC said that ""Christie could well be (President) Obama's favorite Republican governor."" One reason given by the narrator: ""He instituted an Internet sales tax."" The accompanying graphic, beneath a photograph of Christie with a smiling Obama, shows a Wall Street Journal headline from July 16, 2012, which says, ""Christie Embraces Online Sales Tax."" Republicans tend to be passionately opposed to new taxes so we wondered if that was the whole story. First, some background. Currently, under a 1992 U.S. Supreme Court decision, if a customer lives in a state with a sales tax, online companies only have to collect that tax if the company has a physical presence -- such as a warehouse -- in that state. Otherwise, it's up to the consumer to directly pay the tax to the state in the form of a ""use"" tax. The use tax, which nearly all consumers ignore, will become important later in this fact check. The absence of a sales tax on Internet purchases puts local brick-and-mortar businesses at a competitive disadvantage, which is one reason some states would like to tax Internet sales. Another reason, obviously, is that it brings in extra revenue. But critics point out that it can be a nightmare for companies that do business over the Internet to keep track of the widely-varying rules and rates in all the states, counties and municipalities that have a sales tax. So what's Christie's role in all of this? When we contacted the Tampa-based Conservative Solutions PAC, spokesman Jeff Sadosky sent us several links to articles showing that Christie supports an Internet sales tax, including federal legislation designed to standardize the collection system for all states. We also found the 2012 Wall Street Journal report, cited in the commercial, reporting that Christie was one of several Republican governors pushing for a tax on online purchases to help deal with their fiscal crises. But the super PAC didn't just say he supports the tax. It says he instituted it, and here it gets a bit more complicated. New Jersey started getting serious Internet money when Amazon, the online retail giant, decided to build two distribution centers in New Jersey as part of an effort to improve delivery. But Christie didn't have to do anything to get that revenue. (In fact, the state delayed Amazon's requirement to collect New Jersey sales taxes for two years.) ""By building a warehouse, Amazon then has physical presence in the state and must automatically begin collecting sales tax on sales to residents in the state. This is automatic, unless a state passes legislation to exempt them (as one or two have, for a limited transition period of time),"" said Joseph Henchman, vice president for state projects at The Tax Foundation, a business-backed tax policy group that does state-by-state comparisons of tax issues. Amazon also negotiates deals with individual states. It currently pays sales taxes to 27 of the 44 states with such a tax. What Christie -- and the state legislature -- did was institute was a ""click-through nexus"" tax law, commonly called an Amazon tax. It makes Internet companies responsible for collecting the sales tax from New Jersey customers if they, in essence, have middlemen in the state. Said Henchman: ""These are laws that expand the definition of physical presence to something beyond having employees and property in the state. For example, the New York law said that any non-present retailer, who has contracts with in-state people to refer potential customers for compensation, is physically present."" Nineteen states now have such laws, he said. They're becoming popular after the New York Court of Appeals upheld that state's law and the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. New Jersey's law was part of the 2015 budget signed by Christie. It applies to out-of-state online retailers who meet two basic criteria. First, their cumulative income from sales to New Jersey consumers must exceed $10,000 per year. Second, the retailer must have a referral program. That's where a person or business in New Jersey gets a cut of the profits when sending a consumer to the retailer's out-of-state website and the consumer makes a purchase. A true Internet sales tax, one unencumbered by all of these rules, would require federal legislation. But there's a final twist, as acting state treasurer Ford Scudder pointed out. None of this adds to the tax burden of New Jersey residents. Remember the ""use tax"" we mentioned earlier? Residents were already required to pay that sales tax directly to the state on all Internet purchases. ""From our way of thinking, this is not a new tax,"" Scudder said. ""All this is saying is, rather than putting the onus on individual (to pay the use tax), it's on the company"" to pay the same amount as a sales tax. Henchman of the Tax Foundation agreed, ""It's a different way of collecting an existing tax, albeit a tax that wasn't being paid."" Our ruling Conservative Solutions' attack ad says Chris Christie ""instituted an Internet sales tax."" Internet businesses with a physical presence in the state were required to collect a New Jersey sales tax long before Christie took office. For businesses outside the state, Christie did expand the requirement that online businesses pay taxes when they have an agreement with an individual or a business in New Jersey to promote their products. The ad says ""implemented,"" which implies that Christie imposed a new tax burden on residents. In fact, the money New Jersey is collecting through Internet sales is, by law, already owed to the state -- either through the sales tax collected by the business or the use tax that's supposed to be paid by consumers. Because the statement has an element of truth but leaves out critical context, so we rate it Mostly False..",/factchecks/2016/jan/14/conservative-solutions-pac/marco-rubio-superpac-says-chris-christie-imposed-i/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Chelsea Clinton']","
Chelsea Clinton mischaracterizes Bernie Sanders' health care plan
","Hitting the campaign trail on her mother’s behalf, Chelsea Clinton attacked Democratic presidential candidate Sen. Bernie Sanders’ universal health care plan. ""Sen. Sanders wants to dismantle Obamacare, dismantle the CHIP program, dismantle Medicare, and dismantle private insurance,"" Clinton said in New Hampshire Jan. 12. ""I don't want to empower Republican governors to take away Medicaid, to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans. And I think very much that's what Sen. Sanders' plan would do."" The Sanders campaign and his supporters swiftly called Clinton’s statements inaccurate, so we decided to look into them ourselves — in particular, her claim that Sanders’ plan would ""empower"" governors ""to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans."" Given that Sanders’ proposed plan specifically calls health insurance an entitlement for all, we found that this is a mischaracterization at best. Sanders hasn’t released a health care proposal as a presidential candidate, but his campaign has said a bill he introduced in the Senate in 2013 would serve as the model. Sanders has called the plan ""Medicare for all,"" referring to the the health safety net that covers those over 65. Clinton has a point that enacting the law would disrupt health insurance as we know it, said Gerald Friedman, an economics professor at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst who has analyzed similar proposals. The bill, the American Health Security Act of 2013, specifically strips insurance benefits from the Affordable Care Act, the Children’s Health Insurance Program, Medicare and Medicaid. The bill also bans the sale of private health insurance that duplicates benefits provided by the government program. And she is also right that states would be the primary administrators of the system. The bill calls it a ""state-based American Health Security Program."" However, the assertion that it would empower Republican governors to take away individual’s health insurance is misleading. Sanders’ plan requires states to set up the specifics of their health care system, though they must meet federal standards for various administrative details. For example, states must identify a single agency to manage the program. If a state does not set up a system, or if they refuse to meet the federal standards, the federal government will step in and run that state’s program. Clinton’s comments seem to be based on how many Republican governors have reacted to the Affordable Care Act, a.k.a. Obamacare, deciding not to accept an expansion of Medicaid, the government insurance program for low-income individuals. The Sanders’ campaign said the provision that allows the federal government to step in and run state programs would prevent governors who oppose the law from refusing to provide health coverage for their residents or offering subpar programs. The bill also states that every U.S. resident ""is entitled to benefits for health care services"" and would require auto-enrollment at birth or at the point when someone becomes a legal resident. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s campaign told us that Chelsea Clinton’s point was that the law would get rid of all of the existing benefits — Obamacare, Medicaid, Medicare, CHIP, etc. — for everyone. That may be true, but Sanders’ health care seeks to immediately replace all of these programs, as well as attempt to cover all those currently uninsured. That would be a federal-level change, rather than governors choosing to scrap those federal programs, and Sanders’ bill does make an effort to establish measures to circumvent the states that try to undermine the law. It sounds like Clinton is saying that millions would be left totally uninsured as a result of Sanders' plan giving more authority to governors, which isn't the case. ""Her claim is analogous to saying that Medicare dismantled private insurance for the elderly,"" said David Himmelstein, co-founder of Physicians for a National Health Program and an advocate for a national health insurance system. ""It replaced defective private coverage with something better."" Hillary Clinton’s campaign also emphasized that at the very least, state governments could administer the program in such a way that they provide low-quality insurance compared to other states, such as by limiting reimbursement rates for providers. The campaign noted that Sanders' bill says the federal government must fund between 81 and 91 percent of each state’s program, so if a state doesn't cover the remaining costs, that could affect the services provided. One final note: It’s not at all clear that Sanders’ plan would pay for itself or be practical to implement. (We explored those issues in a separate story.) And his plan would certainly get rid of many existing programs. But Chelsea Clinton attacked the plan for one area that seems pretty clear, and that’s its coverage provisions. The plan’s defining feature is that it offers health insurance coverage to every American. Our ruling Chelsea Clinton said Sanders’ health care plan would ""empower"" governors ""to take away health insurance for low-income and middle-income working Americans."" Under Sanders’ plan, Americans would lose their current health insurance. However, his proposal would replace their health insurance and cover the currently uninsured. The program would auto-enroll every citizen and legal resident, all of whom would be entitled to benefits. While the plan would give governors authority to administer health insurance within their states, it includes provisions to allow federal authorities to take over if the governors refuse to implement it. It’s impossible to predict with certainty how Sanders’ plan would play out in real life. But Clinton’s statement makes it sound like Sanders’ plan would leave many people uninsured, which is antithetical to the goal of Sanders’ proposal: universal health care.

Pelosi wrongly says before nuclear deal, Russia, China had never voted with U.S. on Iran sanctions

Rick Scott: Florida completely funded the critical needs waiting list for first time
","Gov. Rick Scott, a Republican seeking $1 billion in tax cuts this year, portrayed state spending on services for disabled Floridians as solid during his 2016 State of the State address. ""With your help, we have invested Florida taxpayer dollars to make a lasting difference in the lives of Florida families,"" he said during the Jan. 12 speech. ""For the first time ever, we completely funded the critical needs waiting list for persons with unique abilities so they can get the help they need."" Scott is technically right about a specific waiting list for people with disabilities, but he omits important context. Namely, the critical needs waiting list is one component within a bigger waiting list for services. Wait-list rundown People with disabilities can apply through the state to get financial assistance through a Home and Community-Based Services Medicaid waiver, a joint state-federal program. The program serves people with intellectual disabilities, autism, cerebral palsy or other disabilities. The goal is to provide them care in their homes or community instead of sending them to more costly institutions. About 32,000 Floridians have this waiver now, but about 20,000 remain on a waiting list, according to a spokeswoman for the Agency for Persons with Disabilities. The state hasn’t provided enough money to fully empty out the waiting list for home- and community-based care. Florida’s waiting list is the second-highest in the nation behind Texas as of 2014, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation. That’s not surprising considering Florida’s large population, but some states do a better job at clearing off the waiting list than others. It’s important to note that Florida’s ""critical needs"" waiting list is a classification devised during Scott’s administration. So when he says he completely funded this waiting list ""for the first time ever,"" he is referring to something that has only existed for a few years. In 2013, the state Agency for Persons with Disabilities had a work group that met to discuss how to reduce the waiting list. ""We decided to take those with the most critical needs first,"" said agency spokeswoman Melanie Etters. That’s when the agency came up with the idea for a specific ""critical needs"" waiting list. The state assesses those on the waiting list and places them into different categories based on criteria set out in state law in July 2010, a few months before Scott took office. People who end up on this critical needs list face difficult circumstances, such as being a child in the welfare system or a person at risk of losing a caregiver. The state received money to whittle the critical needs list starting in 2013 when it gave waivers to 1,600 Floridians. However, some still remained on the list that year. The next year, 2014, the state emptied out the list for the first time when it gave waivers to 1,200 people. Again in 2015, the agency received enough money to offer a waiver to everyone on the critical needs list, around 2,500 at that time. Although the state has brought the list down to zero twice, it then starts to regrow again pretty much instantly as new babies are born or people with disabilities move to the state, sign up for the first time or move into categories deemed critical. Scott’s budget request for the next year calls for enrolling more than 700 individuals from the critical needs list, which is projected to empty the list. We won’t know the outcome of his budget request until the Legislature concludes the session in March. Advocates for people with disabilities said Scott has a point about working to reduce this specific waiting list, but he left out part of the story by not acknowledging the larger, non-""critical needs"" list for services. ""The governor is correct that he has funded the critical needs waiting list, but that’s not to be confused with the overall waiting list,"" said Suzanne Sewell, president of the Florida Association of Rehabilitation Facilities. Other advocates we interviewed backed up her argument. The last time the waiting list was fully funded was when Jeb Bush was governor, and that was as a result of a lawsuit, said Clint Bower, president of MACTown, or the Miami Achievement Center for the Developmentally Disabled. The advocates noted that while some people on the waiting list are not receiving services, others are getting services through other programs, such as at school. And some sign up on the waiting list although they don’t need services now but anticipate they will in the future. They had little hope for the wait list being completely cleared. It would be difficult to do because every year new babies are born with developmental disabilities, and they end up on the waiting list. ""There will always be more people coming on,"" Sewell said. Our ruling Scott said, ""For the first time ever, we completely funded the critical needs waiting list"" for people with disabilities. Advocates said Scott has a point about working to help around 5,000 disabled Floridians get off a narrow waiting list, but he left out two pieces of important context.   First, the critical needs waiting list is a category that Scott’s administration came up with about three years ago, so it’s not as if he had any historical competition. The state offered services to everyone on the critical needs list in 2014 and 2015, and Scott wants to do it again this year. However, Scott omits that those on the critical needs list are a subset of the overall waiting list of about 20,000 people.

Jeb Bush says as governor, he helped reduce youth heroin use in Florida by 50 percent
","Addiction is a deeply personal issue for Republican presidential candidate Jeb Bush, whose daughter Noelle suffered from addiction and a string of related criminal charges while he was serving as governor of Florida. In a Medium post on Jan. 5, 2016, Bush offered a glimpse into ""the heartbreak of drug abuse"" that his family had experienced, along with policy proposals to better address addiction. In the column, Bush discussed his record on drug policy during his gubernatorial tenure. ""As governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent,"" Bush wrote. Bush took office in January 1999 and left in January 2007. We took a closer look into that statistic. (A few days later, Bush turned Noelle's story into a television ad.) The Bush campaign pointed us to the 2006 Florida Youth Substance Abuse Survey conducted by the Florida Department of Children and Families. (Although several surveys of drug use are released on an annual basis, experts told us that this is the only survey that would speak to the specific numerical claim Bush made.)  For heroin use, the survey offers two measurements -- heroin use at any time of one’s life, and heroin use during the past 30 days. For the first category -- use of heroin in one’s lifetime -- 2.2 percent of respondents between the ages of 11 and 18 had used it in 2000, compared to 1.1 percent in 2006. That’s a 50 percent decrease. And for the second category -- heroin use in the past 30 days -- 0.8 percent reported using it in 2000, compared to 0.4 percent in 2006. That’s also down by 50 percent. So numerically, Bush has a point. Still, experts said it’s worth taking those numbers with a grain of salt. Testing the numbers One concern is that the percentage of youth using heroin is small, meaning the differences from year to year are small -- and this makes them potentially unreliable. Indeed, the report itself cautions, ""Heroin use in a school population is extremely rare. Nationally, no lifetime prevalence rate for heroin has exceeded 2.4 percent in the 8th, 10th or 12th grades in the past decade. … Given the extremely low prevalence rates associated with heroin use by Florida students, analyses that attempt to precisely specify or quantify changes over time are subject to error."" In addition, for both measurements, the biggest drop came between 2000 and 2001, with minimal changes between 2002 and 2006. That seemed curious to Lloyd Johnston, a senior research scientist at the University of Michigan's Institute for Social Research and principal investigator of the Monitoring the Future study, which tracks drug use in the United States. ""While that is possible, I don't think it very plausible,"" Johnston said. ""Rates almost always change more gradually."" One possible explanation for that pattern, he said, is that the 2000 survey collected its data in December and January, whereas the 2001 to 2005 surveys conducted their data in April and May of those years. A further curiosity, Johnston said, is that one would not expect a one-year decline that steep for lifetime heroin use. From year to year, the pool of respondents is mostly the same. In the first year, the survey includes youth who are 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18 years of age. The following year, the 18-year-olds drop out and a new group of 11-year-olds joins, but all the other groups are included again. With such modest changes from year to year in the makeup of the age groups, one would not expect a large change in heroin use over a lifetime from one year to the next, Johnston said. ""That makes the lifetime improvement in 2001 highly implausible,"" Johnston said, adding that a sizable change in the 30-day-rates would be more plausible. What was Bush’s role? There’s also a separate issue: Did Bush’s policies help engineer this decline? That’s hard to say, though drug-policy experts in Florida do praise Bush for his work on the issue. James Hall, a drug abuse epidemiologist at Nova Southeastern University, said that Bush gave the issue high priority, including the creation of a drug policy office out of his own office to coordinate law enforcement, treatment, education and prevention. The office -- which was later eliminated by Gov. Rick Scott -- made a ""very significant contribution"" to drug policy in the state, Hall said. In addition, Bush championed community-based anti-drug coalitions that helped consolidate prevention efforts, Hall said. And his wife Columba was also active in drug- and alcohol-abuse issues, he added. Still, such efforts likely had a ""marginal influence"" on heroin-use rates, Hall said. Often, broader issues such as demographic and social trends have a bigger impact. Indeed, it’s worth noting that heroin use among youth was declining nationally during roughly the same period. Johnston’s own study found that heroin use among youth was declining nationally between 1999 and 2007, the full extent of Bush's term in office. ""For the three grades we study (eighth, 10th, and 12th), the combined prevalence of heroin use during the prior 12 months declined from 1.3 percent in 1999 to 0.8 percent in 2007,"" he said. That’s a drop of about 40 percent -- not far from what the Florida-only survey found. Our ruling Bush said that ""as governor of Florida, I used a combination of strategies to help reduce heroin use among youth in Florida by approximately 50 percent."" The only statistics that directly address his statement offer numeric support. However, the report in question cautions against drawing broad conclusions for such low-frequency events as youth heroin addiction, and experts thought it curious that the drop essentially happened in the first year, with little change after that. Experts praise Bush for his drug policies, but it’s important to note that broader demographic and social factors -- reflected in falling youth heroin use nationally during that period -- likely made a difference as well.

Dan Patrick says only two mass shootings since 1950 occurred outside of gun-free zones
","Dan Patrick of Texas hinted he’d like to ease access to guns, then lofted a historical claim making us wonder. The Republican lieutenant governor appeared on NBC’s Jan. 3, 2016 edition of Meet the Press as the Texas law permitting licensed individuals to openly carry holstered handguns took effect. Patrick told host Chuck Todd he wants to see a day ""when every American citizen can simply have a gun, does not have to go through a long ordeal or pay a high price. We're going to address that in Texas, as well. Because it's the right of every individual under the Second Amendment."" Then came the historical note: ""Having law-abiding citizens having guns is a good thing,"" Patrick said. ""In fact, Chuck, every one of the mass shootings except two in America since 1950 have been"" in ""gun-free zones,"" his implication being that wrongdoers don’t open fire in places where permitted citizens may have loaded handguns. That’s at least a disputed analysis. In April 2013, Mother Jones magazine said its review of more than five dozen U.S. ""mass shootings"" since 1982 hadn’t identified a single case of a killer choosing a target because it barred guns nor had it found an instance of an armed civilian saving the day. ""To the contrary, in many of the cases there was clearly another motive for the choice of location. For example, 20 were workplace shootings,"" the magazine said. ""Or consider the 12 school shootings we documented, in which all but one of the killers had personal ties to the school they struck,"" the story said. Moreover, the magazine said, the majority of mass shootings are murder-suicides, arguably not involving perpetrators ""whose priority was identifying the safest place to attack."" So, how did Patrick determine that only two mass shootings since 1950 occurred in places that weren’t gun-free zones? A spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, declined comment on that, but web searches and interviews identified the likely originator of the two-since-1950 claim as economist John Lott Jr., whose books include ""More Guns, Less Crime"" and ""The Bias Against Guns."" Lott, president of the Crime Prevention Research Center, also is a Fox News columnist. In a January 2013 blog post, Lott said: ""Since at least 1950, with two exceptions, all the multiple victim public shootings in the US in which more than three people have been killed have taken place where guns are banned."" In a 2014 web post, the center said: ""There are only two mass public shootings since at least 1950 that have not been part of some other crime where at least four people have been killed in an area where civilians are generally allowed to have guns.  These are the International House of Pancakes restaurant in Carson City, Nevada, on September 6, 2011 and the Gabrielle Giffords shooting in Tucson, Arizona, on January 8, 2011."" Defining ""mass shooting"" Generally we take a gun-free zone to mean a place where civilians can’t legally carry handguns. That’s in the spirit of the Gun-Free School Zones Act, revised by Congress in 1996, which states it’s unlawful for an individual to knowingly carry a firearm that’s been part of interstate or foreign commerce in a school zone or within 1,000 feet of the grounds of a public, parochial or private school. But ""mass shooting"" has had a range of definitions. In a 1996 paper, Lott and a fellow researcher presented a multi-part definition ruling out incidents connected to other crimes and applying other limits. The paper defined ""a multiple public shooting as one in which two or more people are killed or wounded in a church, business, bar, street, government buildings, schools, public transit, place of employment, park, health care facility, mall or restaurant. We excluded multiple shootings that were byproducts of other crimes (e.g., a robbery or drug deal) or that involved gang activity (e.g., drive-by shootings), professional hits or organized crime. We also did not count as a multiple shooting serial killings or killings that took place over the span of more than one day,"" the authors wrote. There are less restrictive definitions. A 2008 FBI report said that over the previous 30 years, a mass murder was described as four or more murders occurring during the same incident, with no distinctive time period between the murders. A 2013 report by the Congressional Research Service said there’s no agreed-upon definition of ""mass shooting,"" so it would define public mass shootings as ""incidents occurring in relatively public places, involving four or more deaths—not including the shooter(s)—and gunmen who select victims somewhat indiscriminately."" Meantime,  an FBI spokesman, Stephen Fischer, advised us by email that a 2012 law set the threshold for a ""mass killing""  as three or more people killed. Mother Jones magazine, in research last updated in December 2015, employed a four-or-more killed definition to conclude that since 1982, there had been at least 73 U.S. mass shootings--meaning public incidents in which four or more people died and the motive appeared to be indiscriminate killing. Still, in an August 2012 story, Mother Jones suggested that classifying a mass murder based on a death count or lack of ties to other crimes could seem arbitrary. ""Dropping the number of fatalities by just one, or including motives of armed robbery, gang violence, or domestic violence, would add many, many more cases,"" the magazine said. Lott summarizes research We reached out to Lott, who estimated by phone there had been about 200 mass shootings since 1950. By email, he sent spreadsheets that he said show how he and other researchers catalogued incidents from 1977 to the present. A result, Lott said, is the conclusion that just the two mass shootings occurred where civilians could legally carry handguns. No signs barred people from bringing handguns into the Nevada restaurant or the Tucson parking lot, Lott said, and both states permitted licensed citizens to carry handguns. We asked Lott about the Aug. 1, 1966, incident when Charles Whitman shot and killed people from atop the University of Texas tower as residents with rifles fired from below; Whitman died after a police officer subdued him from close range. Civilians wielded weapons that day, no? Lott said he classified UT as a gun-free zone because under Texas law until 1996, residents couldn’t legally carry handguns in public except under limited circumstances. Lott, asked how he delved into incidents from 1950 to 1977, pointed out an April 2000 New York Times news story on 100 U.S. ""rampage killings"" from 1949 to 1999. The 100 cases included 20 shootings at schools, 11 at restaurants or shopping malls and 32 at the killer's workplace, the newspaper reported. There were 102 killers, it said, with 425 people killed and 510 injured. We couldn’t tell if the Times determined whether citizens could carry handguns at the shooting sites. Lott told us his research determined, in each Times-listed instance, if laws allowed civilians in a city or state to get gun permits and to carry handguns. He emailed us a map indicating that as of 1986, 29 states allowed civilians to carry handguns and 21 states (including Texas) did not; by 2003, 44 states allowed civilians to carry handguns. An alternate analysis We spotted a short-term breakdown countering Lott’s all-but-two conclusion, though the center headed by Lott maintains it’s wrong. In a 2014 report, Everytown for Gun Safety, a pro-gun control group, said that from 2009 to July 2014, 18 multiple-victim U.S. shootings--meaning any incident where at least four people were killed with a gun--occurred in places where civilian handguns were allowed. Of 33 incidents in public spaces, the report said, 18 took place wholly or in part where concealed guns could be lawfully carried. Conversely, no more than 15 incidents ""took place entirely in public spaces that were so-called ‘gun-free zones,’"" the report said. Jack Warner, an Everytown spokesman, told us by email that a 2010 shooting incident in a Hialeah, Florida, restaurant later was removed from its count; the establishment was a gun-free zone. Seventeen is far more than two, of course, and the Everytown report covered less than six years, far fewer than the 65 years referenced by Lott. Might it be that far more shootings have taken place in locations where a licensed citizen could legally hoist a handgun? Questioning the report, the Lott-led center charged in a September 2014 web post that nearly half the incidents described as occurring where civilians could carry handguns took place either as parts of other crimes or in non-public locations and so shouldn’t have been deemed mass shootings--or the shootings actually took place in gun-free zones such as a Wisconsin temple where guns weren’t allowed, according to a Fox News report authored by John Lott’s son, Maxim, though Mother Jones in 2013 reported that guns were allowed in the temple. The center’s critique gives a taste of Lott’s investigatory approach. According to the post, Lott followed up the March 2009 shooting deaths of eight people in a North Carolina nursing home by calling the home and hearing that neither the home’s residents or staff had been allowed to bring in guns. In another case, after the 2012 shooting deaths of four people at a Georgia spa, Lott ""spoke with someone at the spa after the attack and was told that the killer knew ‘nobody there had a gun.’  ...While the official policy at the spa isn’t clear because the conversation was very short,"" the center wrote, ""the important thing was that the killer knew that there were no guns for people to defend themselves there."" There’s room for quibbling with the center’s critique perhaps in that one of the center’s declared gun-free zones was the Washington Navy Yard, which is fronted by armed guards. We noticed this note in a Lott spreadsheet summarizing that attack: ""There were armed guards at the Washington Navy Yard, and the shooter was familiar with the premises, so he did not select it as a target on the presumption he would not face armed resistance. In fact, the shooter reportedly used a gun that he took from a guard after killing him."" Regardless, Lott told us by email, the shooter knew that past the guard station, he wouldn’t encounter armed individuals. Lott’s note in his spreadsheet summarizing an August 2010 incident in Buffalo lays out his contention that even if civilians legally may have handguns, that’s often unlikely to occur; the note quotes a police inspector saying local authorities virtually never give out gun permits other than for sportsmen to carry weapons for hunting. In the same vein, the center’s 2014 critique said several shootings tallied by the Everytown group occurred in places -- such as Boston, East Oakland and Los Angeles -- where authorities rarely if ever grant handgun permits. By email, Warner gave no ground, saying state and local laws made it legally possible in each of the cited shootings for a civilian to have been present with a handgun. Also, ""narrowing the definition of ‘gun-free zone’ to exclude locations where armed police were stationed does not make sense,"" Warner wrote. An FBI study A 2013 FBI review of ""active shooter incidents"" since 2000 identified five instances when shooting ended after armed individuals who were not law enforcement exchanged gunfire with the shooters; three shooters were killed, one was wounded, one committed suicide.

Grape juice keeps you from getting sick, even after exposure to stomach flu? We wish
","How not to get the stomach flu — even after you’ve been exposed to it? Simple answer, says the Incredible Recipes Facebook account, which has attracted nearly 7.8 million followers over seven years. ""If you’ve been exposed to the stomach flu drink 3 glasses of 100% grape juice a day for 3 days,"" its post on Facebook says. ""It changes the acidity in your stomach. ...This really works!!"" Not getting the flu after going on that regimen, of course, doesn’t mean the juice stopped you from getting sick. But is there evidence that grape juice prevents the stomach flu — after exposure? This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) In the past couple of years when this claim has surfaced, often on cooking and parenting websites, it was knocked down as unproven in articles by the New York Times, Slate, Men’s Health and the fact-checking site Snopes. Unfortunately for flu sufferers, we found the same. The stomach flu is a ""very contagious virus,"" with its vomiting and diarrhea, and occurs an average of 19 million to 21 million times per year, according to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""People with norovirus illness can shed billions of norovirus particles. And only a few virus particles can make other people sick,"" the CDC says. Leading health authorities such as the Mayo Clinic and the CDC each offer a handful of tips on how to avoid getting the stomach flu. But no mention of grape juice. Why not? Like the experts in the other articles, Baylor College of Medicine professor Mary Estes and Ming Tan, a professor in the division of infectious diseases at Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center told us there is no scientific evidence to back the grape juice claim. Stomach flu is normally caused by a virus infection that occurs in the intestinal tract, not in the stomach, and drinking grape juice will not change the acidity of the stomach anyway, Tan told us.  He added: ""Exposure to stomach flu bugs does not necessarily lead to stomach flu because some factors, like your blood type, can affect the attachment of the bugs to your intestinal cells. This explains why only (some) people get sick in a stomach flu outbreak even if everyone has been exposed."" Moreover, said University of Iowa professor of internal medicine and epidemiology Eli Perencevich, once exposed ""you get sick 12 to 24 hours after, so the three-day day thing is another dubious claim."" A Facebook post says:  ""If you’ve been exposed to the stomach flu,"" you can avoid getting it if you ""drink 3 glasses of 100% grape juice a day for 3 days.

No evidence tying union president, jail guards and Bill and Hillary Clinton to Jeffrey Epstein death
","As we have reported, there is no evidence to back conspiracy theories that Bill Clinton and Hillary Clinton were involved in the death of Jeffrey Epstein. The disgraced financier, who was accused of sexually abusing and trafficking underage girls, committed suicide by hanging himself in a Manhattan jail cell Aug. 10.  Two months later, two guards were charged with felony crimes for allegedly falsifying records that they had made regular checks of Epstein.  Now, a Facebook post is trying to tie the head of the union that represents guards at the jail, J. David Cox, to the Clintons. The post, which misspells ""Jeffrey"" for both Cox and Epstein, says:  ""Say hello to Jeffery David Cox the head of Federal Prison Guards in Manhattan. Jeffery is the boss of the guards who were supposed to keep Jeffery Epstein alive while in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in Manhattan. He also is friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton."" Alongside is a photo of Cox and Hillary Clinton looking toward the camera and shaking hands. The implication of the Facebook post, which was flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed, is that Cox was in a position to have played a role in Epstein’s death. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Both points in the post are highly misleading: 1. Cox is president of the American Federation of Government Employees, a union based in Washington, D.C., that represents 700,000 employees at numerous work sites. He didn’t work in the Manhattan jail, much less have authority to assign work shifts to the two guards or monitor their job performance. 2. Cox supported Hillary Clinton’s 2016 campaign for president and his union endorsed her. But the picture of Cox and Clinton is from a union-sponsored campaign event in 2015, based on a caption published with the photo. We found no evidence of any stronger friendship. A spokesman for Hillary Clinton and a spokesman for Bill Clinton each told PolitiFact that it ""is utter nonsense"" that the Clintons and Cox have a friendship.  A spokesman for Cox referred us to an article by the fact-checking operation Snopes. That article concluded that a theory that Cox played a key role in an alleged Clinton-orchestrated conspiracy to kill Epstein was false. ""We found no publicly available evidence that he has a relationship with either Clinton that goes beyond the cordial dynamic that one would expect between a leading national labor union official and two historically powerful figures within the Democratic Party,"" Snopes wrote. Facebook posts say J. David Cox, ""the boss"" of the jail guards ""who were supposed to keep"" suspected sex trafficker Jeffrey Epstein alive, is also ""friends with Bill and Hillary Clinton."" Cox is president of a Washington-based national union for federal employees; he doesn’t work in a Manhattan jail or have authority over its guards. And though Cox supported Hillary Clinton’s run for the 2016 Democratic nomination, there is no evidence of a friendship beyond that.

Viral Facebook post on number of coal plants is wrong
","If you’re ticked off about the number of coal plants in the world, don’t point your finger at the United States, suggests a misleading Facebook post. The post said that there are ""5,615 projected coal-powered plants in just 8 countries. The USA has 15 - building 0 more."" It arrives at that total number of adding up what it says is the number of existing coal plants and the number of coal plants under construction in multiple countries and the European Union. According to the post, the United States only has 15 plants while China has 2,363 and is building 1,171 more. ""LET'S GO WHERE THE PROBLEMS REALLY EXISTS!!!!!!!!"" states the post. We did not find any numbers to back up the 5,615 total. But the post has a point that there are more plants in China than in the United States.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Similar versions of this post have circulated for months.  For actual data on the number of coal plants in various countries, we turned to the Global Coal Plant Tracker published by the Global Energy Monitor. The group has board members from such environmental groups as Clean Energy Action, Greenpeace, and the Rainforest Action Network. The Global Coal Plant Tracker includes all coal-fired units 30 megawatts or larger. The tracker’s July 29 list of coal fired power stations by country counts 2,459 plants in operation, 256 under construction and 359 planned for construction. That adds up to a total of 3,074, far less than the 5,615 in the Facebook post. For the United States, the tracker shows that there are 296 in operation (nearly 20 times more than what this Facebook post claims) with none under construction. In China, there are 1,032 in operation (less than half of what the post claims), 126 under construction and 76 planned for construction. Generally, the best way to compare capacity is by megawatts, said Anna Mikulska, a fellow for the Center for Energy Studies at Rice University. The global tracker’s data shows China at the highest capacity (987,364) followed by the United States (254,332) and then India (225,638). While we found no evidence to back up the numbers in the Facebook post, it is worth noting that the growth of coal isn’t in the United States.  ""It is true that whatever coal the world is going to add, is going to be mostly in the developing world, India and China as well as Southeast Asia,"" Mikulska said. ""Thus, there is a point to be made that that's where we need to look into to try to act upon climate goals."" The United States and Europe are turning away from coal due to cheap and abundant gas and policy considerations, she said. But the developing world is more likely to rely more on coal because it is cheaper, widely available and easier to store and transport. Related FACT-CHECK: Are 1,600 new coal-fired power plants being constructed today? Related FACT-CHECK: Does China burn seven to eight times as much coal as the U.S.? A Facebook post said there are ""5,615 projected coal-powered plants in just 8 countries. The USA has 15 - building 0 more."" The post stated that the number includes plants in operation and being built, but didn’t cite a source and we found no evidence to back it up.

Viral post is wrong about Australia’s gun laws, violent crime statistics
","A photograph that shows a truck unloading a heap of firearms has been shared thousands of times on Facebook. The image is usually displayed alongside text that claims Australia passed a ""new law"" that forced gun owners to surrender 640,381 firearms and that, one year later, statistics show a national surge in violent crimes such as homicides, assaults and robberies. This chain message has been going around the internet since at least 2009.  The statistics didn’t add up then and still don’t today.  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photograph itself is real and was taken in Australia, but it’s from the late 1990s. We tracked it down using a reverse-image search and found it was taken by photographer David Gray on July 29, 1997.  The caption says the truck was unloading prohibited firearms at a Sydney scrap-metal yard and that they were later destroyed: ""The guns were handed in over the past month under the Australian government's buy-back scheme. A total of 470,000 guns have been collected nationally, with owners receiving a $243 million (US $180 million) in compensation."" The caption continues to explain that the buyback program was set up due to tighter gun laws enacted after the April 1996 Port Arthur massacre, when a gunman opened fire in a cafe in Tasmania, killing 35 people in the worst mass murder in Australia’s history. The Australian government thereafter in 1996 passed the National Firearms Agreement in response to the shooting. The measure outlawed automatic and semi-automatic rifles, as well as pump-action shotguns, and instituted the buyback program, which was funded by a tax levy that raised about $500 million. As a result, approximately 640,000 weapons were turned over to the government and firearm owners were paid around $304 million, according to a 1997 report by the Australian National Audit Office. So, the post is correct that 640,000 weapons were handed over to the government. But this happened nearly 25 years ago as part of a buyback program and those participating received financial compensation. More importantly, though, the post is wrong in its claim that the measure resulted in more violent crime in the country.  The post inaccurately says that one year after the buyback, homicides went up 6.2%, assaults went up 9.6% and armed robberies went up 44%. It also says that, in the state of Victoria, homicides with firearms increased 300%. What really happened is homicides declined about 9% to 333 in 1998 compared with a year prior, according to the Australian Institute of Criminology.   There were 132,297 victims of assault in Australia – a 6% increase from 1997 (not 9.6% as the post states), the organization says. Assaults had been on the rise for years. The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported that armed robberies increased by 20% (not 44%), but the number involving firearms decreased to a six-year low of 19%. If we interpret the post to be referring to today’s numbers, it’s still wrong.  The rates of various types of violent crime (excluding sexual assault) has, depending on the crime, stayed the same or declined over the last several years. To summarize our findings, Australia instituted a buyback program in the late 1990s after passing stricter gun legislation, which resulted in more than 640,000 firearms being turned into the government. Meanwhile, the rates of violent crimes did not and have not dramatically increased, as the post suggests.

No evidence Nicole Kidman blacklisted for comments about Donald Trump
","A 2017 story is getting renewed attention as social media users reshare a NewsPunch.com post claiming movie stars and studios were snubbing actress Nicole Kidman after she voiced her support for President Donald Trump.  ""Nicole Kidman ‘blacklisted’ from Hollywood for vowing to support president,"" reads the headline.  ""Nicole Kidman has had contracts cancelled by two Hollywood studios and has been warned by ‘famous liberal celebrities’ to ‘steer clear of the Oscars,’ according to a source at Creative Artists Agency in Los Angeles,"" the story says. ""Why all the hate? Because on January 10th, Nicole Kidman, a Hollywood A-lister, dared to go against the Hollywood agenda and told an interviewer that ‘we need to support whoever is the president.’""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  It’s true that Kidman said Americans should support then-President-elect Donald Trump.   In a Jan. 10, 2017, interview with Victoria Derbyshire on BBC Two, Derbyshire says that Kidman has dual citizenship and voted in the U.S. elections and then asks what Kidman thinks of Trump.  ""I’m always reticent to start sort of commenting politically, I’ve never done it in terms of America or Australia, I’m issue-based,"" she said, before adding, ""He’s now elected and we as a country need to support whosever the president because that’s what the country’s based on. And however that happened, he’s there and let’s go."" Kidman then pivoted to discussing her commitment to ""women’s issues"" and fundraising for breast and ovarian cancer.  As the Washington Post reported at the time, Kidman was quickly criticized on social media. The newspaper also noted that Kidman’s comments were in stark contrast to those of many other celebrities, including Meryl Streep, who had recently given a speech critical of Trump while accepting a Golden Globe award. Others, including Kelly Osbourne, advocated for giving Trump a chance.  ""We have to give him a chance,"" Osbourne then said. ""And we do it by spreading love, not hate.""  Several days after Kidman’s BBC Two interview, Kidman clarified that her comments were about her belief in democracy, and that she wasn’t endorsing Trump, the Associated Press reported.  ""I was trying to stress that I believe in democracy and the American Constitution, and it was that simple,"" she told Access Hollywood.  But we couldn’t find any credible evidence that Kidman has been blacklisted from Hollywood. She attended the 2017 Academy Awards, where she was a nominee for best supporting actress, and since her comments, she’s appeared in movies including: ""Boy Erased,"" ""Aquaman,"" and ""The Goldfinch."" She’s also been an executive producer on several projects.  She’s also starred in the HBO show ""Big Little Lies"" alongside Meryl Streep. In September, USA Today reported that it was Streep who convinced Kidman to take the role of ex-""Fox & Friends"" host Gretchen Carlson in ""Bombshell,"" which is in theaters now.  If evidence emerges that Kidman was blacklisted from Hollywood because of her support for Trump, we’ll reconsider our rating.

Bloomberg claims gains on carbon footprint as mayor
","As Michael Bloomberg campaigns for president, he reminds Democratic primary voters about what he did as New York City mayor for 12 years. That includes his efforts to combat climate change, work that he continued after leaving office.     ""And I might point out when it comes to climate change, we cut New York City’s carbon footprint twice as much as the rest of the country, and we can do that again,"" Bloomberg told a crowd at the opening of his campaign headquarters in Charlotte, N.C.. ""And we have to do that, or we just don’t have a future."" We wondered if Bloomberg’s claim about New York City’s smaller carbon footprint is accurate.  For evidence of his claim, campaign spokeswoman Julie Wood sent us a city report published in 2017 and data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from 2002 to 2013, the period  Bloomberg served as mayor.  The city report, released under Mayor Bill DeBlasio’s administration, shows the city reduced greenhouse gas emissions by 14.8 percent in 2015 compared with 2005 levels. The city began measuring its carbon footprint under Bloomberg, with the earliest data from 2005. ""Much of these reductions were achieved early on, largely as a result of power plants switching their fuel source from coal to natural gas - a less carbon-intensive energy source; and through the construction of new, highly efficient natural gas power plants, both within and outside the city,"" analysts wrote in ""Inventory of New York City Greenhouse Gas Emissions in 2015,"" published in April 2017.  The city reports its analysis includes all direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions from energy used by buildings and other stationary sources, natural gas distribution within the city, on-road transportation, railways, marine navigation, and aviation within the city’s borders, as well as emissions from wastewater treatment and solid waste from the city, even if it is  disposed elsewhere.     For the country as a whole, data from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data Explorer show that greenhouse gas emissions decreased 6.8 percent between 2002 and 2013, when Bloomberg was mayor.  John Reilly, co-director of the Joint Program on the Science and Policy of Global Change at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, called the city’s report a ""carefully done effort."" Also, the federal data the Bloomberg campaign directed us to is the ""authoritative accounting"" of greenhouse gas emissions for the United States, Reilly said.  Reilly called Bloomberg’s statement ""basically accurate.""  But he added some observers could take issue with the claim. He said that ""carbon footprint"" is more often associated with a broader definition than the one the city uses. The broader definition includes the full life cycle of emissions of all goods consumed in the city, such as emissions associated with steel used to produce automobiles sold or used in the city, and methane emissions from cattle raised to produce beef eaten in the city. However, these emissions are difficult to account for accurately, much less control. For these reasons, Reilly said that the city is better off analyzing its emissions as it does, focusing on the narrower definition.      Observers could also take issue with Bloomberg calling New York City’s emissions lower than the ""rest of the country."" The federal data includes New York City, not the country minus the city. Other places in the United States also performed better than New York City, he said. Bloomberg tells a ""legitimate story"" that New York City ranks among the nation’s leaders for taking climate seriously, Reilly said. The city emerged as a leader because of Bloomberg’s focus on the issue as mayor, and the city makes a serious effort to assess its progress, he said.  We consulted other experts who had other reactions. On the left, Greenpeace noted that the 6.8 percent drop in emissions nationwide covered a different period than the New York City report, which includes years 2014 and 2015, beyond Bloomberg’s mayoral tenure.  We were curious about this as well, and we found the most recent city data show that in Bloomberg’s last year as mayor, 2013, there was a 12.8 percent reduction in greenhouse gas emissions compared with 2005 levels. While close, New York City's reduction between 2005 and 2013 is not quite twice as much as the country's 6.8 percent reduction between 2002 and 2013.     On the right, the conservative Manhattan Institute connected us with an adjunct fellow there, energy industry consultant Jonathan Lesser, who said that Bloomberg’s claim is ""irrelevant - totally, utterly and completely,"" and that emissions reductions in New York City are ""meaningless from the standpoint of global climate change."" He also noted that the city report does not go back to Bloomberg’s earliest years in office.    Bloomberg said his administration cut the city’s carbon footprint twice as much as the rest of the country.  Bloomberg was in office between 2002 and 2013. During a somewhat different timeframe, 2005 to 2013, the city’s greenhouse gas emissions fell 12.8 percent. During the years of Bloomberg’s tenure, greenhouse gases fell nationally by 6.8 percent.  We rate his claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2020/jan/11/michael-bloomberg/bloomberg-claims-gains-carbon-footprint-mayor/

Fact-checking Facebook post about Saudi terrorists and Saudis on 45th floor of Trump tower

Saudi terrorists has killed more Americans on our soil than any other nation. 2. They rent the entire 45th floor of Trump Tower, And pay him in cash. Those are facts."" The role of Saudi Arabian terrorists as part of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks is fairly well known (and we’ll recap it below). But we were intrigued by the second part of the claim about the happenings on the 45th floor of Trump Tower. We found that part of the story misleading. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) About 3,000 people died in the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001 — the largest number of deaths in the United States caused by violent extremism, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office.  The CIA identified 19 men as being the hijackers in the attacks and that the nationality of 15 of them was Saudi. (One was Egyptian, one Lebanese and two were from the United Arab Emirates.) In June 2001 (more than 15 years before he’d become president, and months before the 9/11 attacks), Trump sold — not rented — the entire 45th floor of Trump World Tower in New York City to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, according to multiple reports. The transaction earned Trump $4.5 million, according to the New York Daily News.  So, that’s a cash payment — but not, as the post suggests, handing over actual currency every month. And certainly not in the present tense. The apartments, located near the United Nations headquarters, were converted in 2008 into part of the Saudi Mission to the UN. Fifteen of the 19 hijackers in the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the worst-ever on American soil, were Saudi.  The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, not Saudi terrorists, bought the 45th floor of Trump World Tower, in 2001.

Trump exaggerates spending on U.S. military rebuild
","President Donald Trump touted U.S. military might in a White House address responding to Iranian missile strikes launched against U.S. troops in Iraq.  ""The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost of $2.5 trillion,"" Trump said in the Jan. 8 address. ""U.S. armed forces are stronger than ever before."" ""The fact that we have this great military and equipment, however, does not mean that we have to use it,"" he continued. ""We do not want to use it."" RELATED: Fact-checking Donald Trump's speech after Iran missile strikes on US troops We wondered if Trump really put that much money toward a rebuild, so we decided to put his claim to the Truth-O-Meter. We found that he overstated the degree to which the United States’ military investments have gone toward restoring the military’s equipment and capabilities. The White House did not respond to requests for comment. Experts pointed us to the total defense budgets for the last four fiscal years, which run from October through September. In the 2017 fiscal year, which began under President Barack Obama and extended into Trump’s term, $606 billion was spent on defense. In the 2018 fiscal year, that number was $670.6 billion.  The 2019 fiscal year saw $685 billion enacted for defense. And for the 2020 fiscal year, Trump signed a bill in December — three months after the fiscal year began — that authorized $738 billion for the Pentagon. So, the total amount of money earmarked for defense under Trump comes out to nearly $2.7 trillion, which is slightly higher than his talking point. But counter to Trump’s framing, not all of that money has been spent. Trump lumped the $738 billion for 2020 that he approved in December into his $2.5 trillion cost estimate. At a little more than three months into the fiscal year, that money will take time to serve its purpose. Rebuilding the military would also require new equipment that can take years to build and develop; it isn’t likely that the funds just allocated for 2020 have already been used to assemble new ships, submarines, fighter jets and weapons, as Trump’s claim suggested.   Plus, only some of the money dedicated to defense has gone toward procurement, or buying and upgrading equipment. It hasn’t all been put toward a complete overhaul. The Pentagon spent roughly $419 billion on procurement through the first three fiscal years of Trump’s presidency, and Congress appropriated about $143.5 billion more in the spending bill Trump signed for the 2020 fiscal year, bringing that total to about $562.5 billion. The rest of the defense dollars over the last four years have been directed toward research and development, military personnel, and operation and maintenance costs, among other things. Experts also noted that the bulk of the $2.5 trillion would have been spent anyway, regardless of who was president. ""Most of that money was going to be spent under Obama,"" said Michael O’Hanlon, a senior fellow in foreign policy at the Brookings Institution. ""Trump’s net increases have been about $100 billion each year, or $400 billion total compared with earlier expectations."" The administration’s scaled-up defense spending has helped make troops and equipment more ready for combat, O’Hanlon said. But overall, Trump’s claim of a total rebuild is ""hyperbole.""  ""Most weapons are the same as before,"" O’Hanlon said. ""There is more continuity than change in defense policy from Obama to Trump."" According to an index of the military’s strength by the conservative Heritage Foundation, the military currently receives a grade of ""marginal."" ""The active component of the U.S. military is two-thirds the size it should be, operates equipment that is older than should be the case, and is burdened by readiness levels that are problematic,"" the report concluded. ""The current U.S. military force is likely capable of meeting the demands of a single major regional conflict while also attending to various presence and engagement activities,"" it said. ""It would be very hard-pressed to do more."" Trump said, ""The American military has been completely rebuilt under my administration at a cost of $2.5 trillion."" The military is far from ""completely rebuilt."" The Trump administration has made some strides in improving the military’s operational readiness, but most weapons and infrastructure are the same as they were before Trump took office. The element of truth is in Trump’s $2.5 trillion number, which comes from the total defense budgets for the last four fiscal years.  Still, not all of that money has been spent, and not all of it has gone toward what would be considered a rebuild under any reasonable definition of the phrase.

US Senate candidate Erica Smith gets 'historic' claim half right
","For a sign that North Carolina’s US Senate race is tight, look at the polls. Incumbent Republican Sen. Thom Tillis at one point last year had the lowest approval rating of all senators, according to one poll. On the Democratic side, two of the five candidates appear to be getting the most attention.  Cal Cunningham, who was endorsed by the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, raised more than $1 million in the third quarter of 2019 alone. But in the polls, Cunningham hasn’t separated from NC Sen. Erica Smith, who raised about $40,000 that quarter.  In fact, Smith has polled quite well. In an interview with Spectrum News host Tim Boyum, Smith described her run as historic. And she made a couple claims that caught our attention. Around the 1-minute mark of the interview video, she said, ""There have been five polls that have been conducted since this race began. And in every poll, not only am I ahead of the Democratic challengers, but I’m beating Thom Tillis in all of those polls that show a head-to-head match. I am beating incumbent Senator Thom Tillis and I am beating him by the widest margins."" Around the 6-minute mark, she added, ""There has been no one, no black woman of color who has been running for U.S. Senate in this nation and beating the incumbent in every poll out the gate. We’re making history."" (Actually, there have been six public polls. But we’re not going to focus on that error, since it’s likely unimportant to readers.) Instead, we’ll focus on her two much bigger claims. Is Smith beating both Cunningham and Tillis in the polls? And, is she the first black woman to lead an incumbent U.S. Senator upon entering a race? This is a classic case of cherry-picking. Smith cites polls that are either old or inconclusive to make a sweeping claim that gives a misleading impression. No poll that featured all three candidates showed anyone with a lead that cleared the margin of error. Also, Smith has appeared in only half of the public polls on the race. SMITH POLL RESULTS PolitiFact found six public polls on the race and only three of them mention Smith. Smith’s best performance: getting 46 percent support to Tillis’ 39 percent in an Emerson College poll. This is the only poll where her poll victory was outside the margin of error, which was 3.1 percentage points.  The drawback? The poll was conducted between May 31 and June 3, before Cunningham entered the race. Jason Husser, director of Elon University’s poll, said voters shouldn’t put too much stock into polls conducted so early in a campaign. ""At this early moment, the vast majority of voters tend to rely on party labels when answering survey questions about non-presidential races,"" Husser said. ""That will change when campaigns do more voter outreach over the next couple of months. However, almost all poll numbers for non-presidential primaries are highly volatile at this time."" Head-to-head against Cunningham: there has only been public poll. A Fox News poll conducted between Nov. 10 and 13 found that 18 percent of respondents supported Smith, while 13 percent supported Cunningham. The hangup? Nearly 50 percent of people polled said they were undecided. In other words, more than twice as many people were undecided as chose Smith. (Note: in a similar fact check from 2017, PolitiFact hesitated to label a US Senate race ""neck-and-neck"" because a plurality of voters were undecided.) The only poll that featured Smith, Cunningham and Tillis was conducted by Meredith College between Sept. 29 and Oct. 7. It showed Smith polling less than a percentage point ahead of Tillis, and Cunningham polling less than a percentage point behind Tillis. There are a couple reasons this poll shouldn’t be seen as a reflection of who’s winning  or leading the race. In terms of counting actual people: Smith had only four more supporters than Tillis, and Tillis had only seven more supporters than Cunningham out of 996 people polled. Smith’s results were also within the Meredith survey’s 3 percent margin of error, so poll director David McLennan referred to the race as ""neck and neck."" He added, ""I would not call anything in the margin of error as a lead for Smith."" OTHER POLLS Smith can accurately say she has, at one point, polled ahead of each of her opponents. But she’s not the only one who can claim to be polling ahead of Tillis. Cunningham also scored better than Tillis in not one, but three head-to-head matchups. However, none of those leads were outside each respective poll’s margin of error. A Public Policy Polling poll conducted on June 17 and 18 found Cunningham to be ahead of Tillis by 1 percentage point. The margin of error was 4 percentage points. An AARP poll conducted between July 29 and July 31 also showed Cunningham ahead of Tillis by 1 percentage point. The margin of error was 4 percentage points.  Another PPP poll conducted on Sept. 16 and 17 had Cunningham leading Tillis 45 percent to 43 percent. The margin of error was 3.9 percentage points. OLD POLLING LIMITED Now let’s look at the second part of Smith’s claim. To determine its accuracy, we need to know how many black women have run for US Senate and what their polling numbers were. This part of Smith’s claim is more difficult to check because the crux of her claim is about polling, not whether a black woman went on to win. But it’s difficult to find a comprehensive list or even a total number of African American women who have run for Senate in any state in the last 150 years. Polling records are even more spotty, said Kathleen Weldon, director of operations at Cornell University’s Roper Center for Public Opinion Research.  ""There’s no database of people who have campaigned for an office (and) there are many short-lived campaigns,"" Weldon said. The Roper Center only has comprehensive records for national polls, she said. Comparing state-level polling is even harder to do. The Rutgers University Center for American Women and Politics tracks minorities who have been elected to high-profile offices. But the group only has data back to 2004, said Chelsea Hill, CAWP’s data services manager. At least 31 black women have run for the Senate since 2004, she said. ONE POSSIBILITY Experts struggled to recall off-hand a black woman who definitely polled well against an incumbent early in a race. But they mentioned one possibility: Carol Moseley Braun. Braun is one of only two black women to ever serve in the U.S. Senate. The other is current California Senator Kamala Harris. Harris won an open seat in 2016.  Braun went on to represent Illinois from 1993 to 1999 after defeating incumbent Alan Dixon in the Democratic primary. PolitiFact could find no record of Braun leading in the polls.  The University of North Carolina’s H. W. Odum Institute for Research in Social Science, which has a collection of old polls, found records that Dixon polled ahead of Braun throughout the primary. Author D. Harris also claimed in the book ""Black Feminist Politics from Kennedy to Clinton"" that Moseley Braun trailed in the polls up until the primary. ""The week before the primary, a Chicago Sun Times/Fox News Chicago poll showed Dixon with the support of 41% of Democrats who planned to vote, compared to 29% for Moseley Braun and 21 percent for Hofeld,"" Harris wrote. And the Chicago Tribune called Braun’s win a ""stunning victory."" OUR RULING Smith said she’s polling ""ahead"" of Democratic candidates for North Carolina’s US Senate seat and is the first black, female Senate candidate to be ""beating the incumbent in every poll out of the gate."" Smith appears to be right about the fact that no other black woman has polled ahead of a sitting U.S. Senator. But it’s a stretch for Smith to claim she’s beating Cunningham or Tillis. She did poll higher than Tillis ""out of the gate,"" but that was before Cunningham entered the race. And there’s no poll featuring all three candidates that showed Smith with a lead that cleared the margin of error. Smith’s claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

This claim that Biden revealed the names of Seal Team 6 members is still wrong
","New year, old, debunked claims. A Jan. 6 Facebook post wrongly alleges presidential candidate Joe Biden ""murdered U.S. Navy Seals.""   ""He revealed the names and the unit that killed bin Laden,"" the post continues, ""on May 3, 2011, at a national event in Washington. His reckless action put at risk the lives of every member of Seal Team 6. The Taliban and other jihadists eager to avenge bin Laden now knew which unit to target. Stunned and shocked, Seal Team Six members immediately realized they were going to be hunted by al Qaeda sympathizers. Soon after Biden’s reckless idiotic speech, an American CH47 Chinook was shot down by a rocket propelled grenade in the Tangi Valley, Maidan Wardak Provience, Afghanistan, all 38 aboard were killed including most if not all of Seal Team 6."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  As we previously reported, Biden praised the Navy SEALs in an address two days after the death of Osama bin Laden, al-Qaida’s leader. But he didn’t say the specific SEAL unit or name any of its members. And his speech came after it was already publicly known that the SEALS were part of the operation.  Here’s the timeline: On May 2, 2011, Bin Laden was killed during a military raid carried out by an elite, highly classified unit of the U.S. Navy SEALs called SEAL Team 6. President Barack Obama announced the 9/11 organizer was dead during a televised address, saying ""a small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability."" He didn’t mention the Navy SEALs or SEAL Team 6. After Obama’s address, media outlets, including the New York Times, reported that the SEALs were involved in the operation. The paper didn’t name the individuals who were a part of that team, only reporting that Obama ""gave the final order for members of the Navy SEALs and C.I.A. operatives to strike."" The Washington Post, meanwhile, ran a story with this headline: ""Navy SEALs who killed Osama bin Laden are from the elite ‘Team 6,’ May 2, 2011 On May 3, after news organizations publicly disclosed the SEALs’ role, Biden, then vice president, gave a speech at the Atlantic Council Awards Dinner, where U.S. Navy Admiral James Stavridis received a military leadership award.   ""Admiral Jim Stavridis is the real deal,"" Biden said. ""He could tell you more about and understands the incredible, the phenomenal, the just unbelievable capacity of his NAVY SEALs and what they did last Sunday.""  He mentioned the SEALs again later in his speech, adding that he was ""in absolute awe — awe — of the capacity and dedication of the entire team, both the intelligence community, the CIA, the SEALs."" He didn’t mention SEAL Team 6 or any of its members by name, as the Facebook post claims. Still, his remarks and the Obama administration drew criticism for publicly crediting the SEALs with bin Laden’s killing after a helicopter carrying 30 American military members — including 15 from SEAL Team 6 — was shot down by Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan.  But an investigation concluded there was no evidence the helicopter was targeted as part of a pre-calculated attack. In 2014, Garry Reid, then a deputy assistant secretary for special operations and low-intensity conflict in the Department of Defense, told Congress that officials didn’t think the mission was compromised.  ""There was no external coordination so there’s no possibility of information going up the chain and somehow going out to the Taliban,"" Reid said. Snopes, which fact-checked a similar claim last year, reported that it asked Stavridis by email if he felt Biden’s words put SEAL team members’ lives at risk.  ""The Navy Special Warfare community is generally (and appropriately) tight lipped about their operations,"" Snopes quotes Stavridis as saying by email. ""That said — I did not believe that night in May 2011 — or today — that Vice President’s Biden’s comments were in any way inappropriate or that they put at risk the lives of those who conducted that historic operation.

Milwaukee vs. Flint: Which city leads on lead?
","State Sen. Lena Taylor, one of several candidates for Milwaukee mayor, has taken aim at four-term incumbent Tom Barrett on a series of topics. Among them: Gun crimes, reckless driving and even the end of the city’s residency requirement for its workers -- something Barrett opposed when GOP lawmakers moved to lift it. ""We have a clean water catastrophe with lead levels that are higher than Flint, MI,"" Taylor, D-Milwaukee, said in a Nov. 20, 2019 news release that summed up her gripes with Barrett.  The non-partisan mayoral primary will be held February 18, 2020. The top two finishers will compete in the April 7, 2020, general election. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, even low levels of lead in blood have been shown to cause developmental delays and learning difficulties in children. Lead exposure also harms adults, who may suffer high blood pressure, joint pain, headaches and an increased risk of having a miscarriage or premature birth.  Problems in Milwaukee’s Health Department have been no secret, including concerns over the city’s testing of lead levels in children.  Flint, of course, became a focal point of alarm in 2014, when the city switched its drinking water supply from Detroit’s system to water from the Flint River in a cost-saving move. The change led to a national scandal, with a sudden jump in childhood lead poisoning numbers. Is Taylor correct about a ""clean water catastrophe"" in Milwaukee with lead levels in the water  higher than Flint’s? A tale of two cities When we contacted Taylor’s office, legislative aide Michelle Bryant provided links to various articles on the topic, including a 2018 article by the Observatory, a fact-checking website staffed by students and faculty at the University of Wisconsin-Madison School of Journalism and Mass Communication, and a 2017 Wisconsin Public Radio article titled ""Milwaukee's Lead Problem Is Complex And Could Cost Billions To Fix."" Bryant also said Taylor was ""referring to blood-lead levels."" That presents a problem off the bat, because Taylor’s claim was explicitly about water and the nature of the two situations is vastly different.  First, Flint’s problems emerged after a change in the source of drinking water, so it was easy to trace a jump in numbers to the change as the cause. Milwaukee has not changed its water source; its drinking water has long been drawn from Lake Michigan. What’s more, children are exposed to many sources of lead beyond water, notably in paint dust in older homes and even in the soil.  Even staunch advocates for tackling lead in the water don’t argue that water is the sole cause of elevated lead levels in children. ""Our situation is very different from what happened in Flint -- which involved switching water sources, not using anti-corrosion treatment and criminal negligence,"" Kirsten Shead, co-executive director of Milwaukee Water Commons, said in an email.  Milwaukee Water Commons is a network of groups focused on water quality. Its funding includes grants, such as $150,000 awarded in 2018 by the Kresge Foundation.   In short, Taylor’s claim focused on lead in the water, but by citing the lead levels in children as evidence, she is sweeping in every possible cause for elevated lead levels and using it to bolster a narrower claim.  So, there are three elements we will look at in evaluating this claim: -- Lead levels in the water supply -- Lead levels in the blood of children -- And whether it’s fair to attribute lead levels in children primarily to a ""clean water catastrophe,"" as Taylor does. Let’s dive in. Lead levels in the water supply In Flint, water in the Flint River was naturally high in corrosive chlorine. The problem was that after the switch, water from the river was not properly treated with orthophosphate, which limits corrosion, according to a July 2018 article by the National Review.  In 2015, Flint pediatrician Mona Hanna-Attisha reported that the incidence of elevated blood-lead levels in children citywide had nearly doubled since the water changeover in 2014 — and nearly tripled in certain neighborhoods.  By comparing the two cities, Taylor is suggesting Milwaukee’s water supply is even more scandalous. In Flint, there was bad water introduced into the system at the start, so it potentially affected everyone. In Milwaukee, the dynamic is quite different.  The Milwaukee Health Department notes, ""there is no lead in Milwaukee's drinking water as it leaves our treatment plants, but lead can dissolve into the water as it sits in lead service lines that connect your house to the water main in the street. Lead also may be present in interior plumbing and fixtures.""  In other words, the problem is introduced further down the line -- often, literally, in the water lines that run between city mains and houses.  Milwaukee has 70,000 residential lead-lined service lines, accounting for about 40% of the total in the state. The city treats its water with anti-corrosive material -- something Flint did not do. Nevertheless, lead can still leach into the drinking water before it reaches faucets.  What about the levels in water at homes?  Regular testing is required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, though the approach varies somewhat between the cities. The sampling is from confirmed ""tier 1"" sites -- single-family homes with lead service lines or lead in indoor plumbing.   In measuring for lead in the water, there is no amount that is considered ""safe,"" but federal regulations state that at least 90% of water samples tested under the Lead and Copper Rule must have lead measuring at or below 15 parts per billion (ppb). In Flint, at the height of the problem, results were off the charts.  During 2015 testing at one home, stunned researchers tallied 2,429 ppb lead -- with one reading at an astonishing 13,200 ppb, according to a research team of professors and graduate students at Virginia Tech.  Since then, levels have gone down dramatically.  Flint’s water-lead level was at 6 ppb in a testing period that ended in December 2017, according to the state of Michigan.  Meanwhile, 2017 testing in Milwaukee found lead levels at 7.2 ppb, according to Milwaukee Water Works spokesman Brian DeNeve.  So, by that measure Milwaukee comes out higher than Flint now, but far below Flint’s levels at the height of the crisis. Beyond that, it is important to note that the levels in Milwaukee are more than 50% below the threshold deemed acceptable by the EPA. That, too, undermines the ""catastrophe"" element of Taylor’s claim. Lead levels in the blood of children The CDC recommends public health interventions if a child tests at 5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in blood, or above. The agency has determined children from low-income families, living in older houses or who are ethnic minorities are more likely to have elevated blood-lead levels.  In both cities, testing efforts are focused on children in households that receive Medicaid, or are in low-income areas. Every child is not tested. In 2018, 2,897 children under age 6 in Flint had blood tests for lead.  Of those, 69, or 2.4%, had levels at 5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in blood, according to Lynn Sutfin, public information officer for the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services. For children age 6 to 17, of the 1,117 who were tested, only 7 -- or 0.6% -- had elevated blood lead levels.  In Milwaukee in 2018, meanwhile, 9.1% of those tested had levels at 5 micrograms per deciliter of lead in blood, according to Claire Evers, deputy commissioner of environmental health. She noted levels had improved for all children tested under the age of 6. Still, by this measure as well, Milwaukee’s levels are higher than Flint. But this remains a bit off point, since Taylor’s claim was focused on lead in the water. That said, lead levels in children is a problem Milwaukee health officials have spent decades trying to address. The ongoing policy debate is not whether something should be done, but how best to tackle it. Water vs. paint and other factors In her claim, Taylor put the blame for Milwaukee’s lead levels squarely on water. But there are other major factors at play. According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services, unlike in Flint, where the city’s lead problems were traced to the switch in the city’s drinking water supply, Milwaukee water problems can be traced mainly to the city’s older housing stock, specifically old lead-based paint. ""Wisconsin’s children continue to be affected by lead poisoning,"" a 2016 DHS report said. ""Lead-based paint in older homes is the primary source of lead exposure in children’s environment. Lead-based paint is a particular problem in Wisconsin, due to its high prevalence in older housing stock."" Indeed, maps that show the parts of Milwaukee with the most too-high levels results track with neighborhoods that contain the city’s oldest housing stock. Often, city records show, those houses are not well maintained -- with many subject to fix-up orders from the Department of Neighborhood Services.  To be sure, those same Milwaukee neighborhoods have a high prevalence of lead-lined laterals that go from the city’s water mains to individual properties.  Of note, several other old-line suburbs that receive water from Milwaukee have lead-lined laterals, but do not have nearly the same prevalence of lead levels in children. That underlines the fact that other factors are at play.    Shead, the co-executive director of Milwaukee Water Commons, said that does not mitigate the need to address lead in the water.  ""Exposure to lead in our drinking water through our lead service pipes is a risk and needs to be solved, in Milwaukee and across the State of Wisconsin,"" she said. ""We believe that replacing our old lead infrastructure needs to be prioritized and happen within a generation. And this work can only be done by our city government."" Our ruling Taylor said Milwaukee has ""a clean water catastrophe with lead levels that are higher than Flint, MI."" Milwaukee does top Flint in two key measurements: Water tested at homes and lead levels in the blood of children.  But characterizing the situation as a ""clean water catastrophe"" goes too far. Milwaukee’s situation is far different from Flint as it relates to the water supply, and numbers from tests at homes fall below allowable levels. What’s more, the claim of a ""clean water catastrophe"" ignores the role that lead-based paint and other factors are known to have on children. Our definition of Half True is ""The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2020/jan/10/lena-taylor/milwaukee-vs-flint-which-city-leads-lead/

Iranian missiles aimed at U.S. troops were not funded by American taxpayers
","The Iranian missile strikes launched against U.S. forces in Iraq inspired the spread of false and inaccurate claims on Facebook, with one post taking aim at former President Barack Obama. ""The missiles that were launched at American forces in Iraq from Iran, were funded by Barack Obama, with American tax dollars. Let that sink in,"" said a Jan. 8 Facebook post from a page that calls itself ""Conservative Headquarters.""  A text image posted to Facebook on Jan. 8, 2020 contains a claim that we rate False. The post, with over 19,000 shares, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  It cites a 2016 article from the Washington Free Beacon, a conservative website. But the Free Beacon post – from nearly four years ago – doesn't allege what the Facebook image did. There is no evidence that the Iranian missiles were paid for by U.S. taxpayers.  The Facebook post, like other posts and claims we’ve fact-checked before, misrepresents terms of the Iran nuclear deal that Obama signed on behalf of the United States in 2015.  The deal with Iran was promoted by Obama, but it was also signed by China, Russia, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom, with assistance from the European Union. The deal allowed Iran to regain access to some of its own assets, which had been frozen as an economic sanction levied in retaliation for the country’s pursuit of a nuclear weapon. The United States and other countries lifted the sanctions and freeze on funds after international inspectors verified in 2016 that Iran was doing enough to curb its nuclear program. So the money was Iran’s. It wasn’t handed to Iran by the United States or Obama, nor was it funded by U.S. taxpayers. It’s not clear what ultimately happened to the funds. In January 2016, then-Secretary of State John Kerry said he expected that some of the money would end up with organizations involved in terrorism. But there’s no evidence that the money was behind the strike in Iraq. On Jan. 5, after a U.S. airstrike killed top Iranian military leader Gen. Qassem Soleimani, Iran said it would no longer comply with the limits the deal placed on its ability to enrich uranium. In addition to the unfreezing of assets, the United States did provide Iran $1.7 billion as part of a settlement ending a legal dispute. That money was part of a cash transfer that the Congressional Research Service reviewed. It resolved an arms contract between the United States and Iran that predated the Iranian revolution in 1979. Iran had paid for military equipment, but it was never delivered. As we’ve noted before, there was $400 million in that account as of 1990, and negotiators agreed that accrued interest would add $1.3 billion to the amount. The United States sent the money to Iran in euros, Swiss francs and other currencies. But this was a repayment, meaning the United States was giving Iran its money back with interest. And while the interest came from a government fund maintained by taxpayer dollars, the money being reimbursed originated with Iran, not the U.S. taxpayer. And again, there’s no evidence that this money ultimately went toward the recent missile strikes. A Facebook post said, ""The missiles that were launched at American forces in Iraq from Iran, were funded by Barack Obama, with American tax dollars."" The 2015 Iran nuclear deal was signed by multiple nations, and it did not involve the United States or Obama cutting a check to Iran. The funds Iran received were its own frozen assets. American tax dollars were never part of the deal. A separate payment that went to Iran under Obama was to settle a decades-old dispute over U.S. military equipment that Iran paid for but never received. We rate this statement False. Clarification and update, Jan. 10, 2020: The Washington Free Beacon story cited by the author of the viral image never alleged that taxpayer dollars were used to fund the missiles launched at American forces in Iraq.

According to a BBC News report posted Jan. 7, the same day as the ToddStarnes.com article, the blazes had destroyed nearly 2,000 homes and killed 25 people and millions of animals since September.  As for the cause, the website article claims ""many of the fires were set by arsonists."" The article cites a news story in The Australian that said that more than 180 people have been arrested since the start of the bushfire season and that Swinburne University professor James Ogloff said that about 50% of bushfires were ""lit by firebugs.""  The 180 figure is wrong. New South Wales police reported on Jan. 6 that it has taken ""legal action"" against 183 people for bushfire-related offenses since Nov. 8. But that number includes 24 people charged with deliberately setting bushfires, 53 people cited for allegedly failing to comply with a total fire ban and 47 people cited for allegedly discarding a lighted cigarette or match on land. Not all of these people were arrested, as the Starnes article claims. Moreover, bot and troll accounts are likely involved in a ""disinformation campaign"" exaggerating the role of arson in the fires, according to a social media analysis by a lecturer at Queensland University of Technology in Australia, The Guardian reported. Meanwhile, experts have been widely quoted saying climate change has made the fires worse. A sampling: Associated Press: ""Scientists, both those who study fire and those who study climate, say there’s no doubt man-made global warming has been a big part, but not the only part, of the fires"" — with 2019 in Australia having been the hottest and driest on record. Stanford University environmental studies director Chris Field, who chaired an international scientific report on climate change and extreme events, said this is one of the worst, if not the worst, climate change extreme events he’s seen. BBC News: ""Australia has always experienced bushfires — it has a ‘fire season’ — but this year they are a lot worse than normal … The overwhelming scientific consensus is that rising levels of CO2 are warming the planet. And Australia has been getting hotter over recent decades and is expected to continue doing so."" … Climate change is ""not the cause of bushfires, but scientists have long warned that a hotter, drier climate would contribute to Australia's fires becoming more frequent and more intense.""  USA Today: ""Human-caused climate change is worsening the wildfires scorching Australia, experts say. Climate change is increasing bushfire risk in Australia ‘by lengthening the fire season, decreasing precipitation and increasing temperature,’ according to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology."" A conservative website said: ""The Australia bushfires have nothing to do with climate change; it was arson."" It is widely believed by experts that climate change has made the fires much worse than they otherwise would have been, while the role of arson in causing the fires has been widely overstated.
