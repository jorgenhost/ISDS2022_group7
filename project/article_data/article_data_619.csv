Obama said he got health care insurance for 4 million kids
","
President Barack Obama went on comedian Jon Stewart's ""The Daily Show"" on Oct. 27, 2010, to make his case to younger voters.

Stewart was a tough questioner of the president, saying that despite a campaign that promised audacious change, ""legislatively, it has felt timid at times.""

Obama said he disagreed with that, adding, ""We've done things that some folks don't even know about.""

""What have you done that we don't know about? Are you planning a surprise party for us? Filled with jobs and health care?"" Stewart asked.

Obama then listed a string of accomplishments, including this one: ""Before we even passed health care, 4 millions kids got health insurance that didn't have it before, through the Children's Health Insurance Program.""

You might not remember it, but an expansion to the state Children's Health Insurance Program became law very early in Obama's presidency. The program provides insurance to children in families who aren't poor enough to qualify for Medicaid but can't afford private insurance.

President George W. Bush had vetoed the legislation twice in 2007, on the grounds that it increased tobacco taxes and would expand government-run health insurance programs to the middle class. Obama signed the law on Feb. 9, 2009.

Now, what about the 4 million kids? Was it really that many?

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office calculated in 2007 that the law would expand eligibility to 3.8 million children but that would be after the new law had been in place four years. Obama's bill has been in place just under two years, so it likely hasn't increased by that much. Because the program is administered by the states, the most recently available national enrollment figures on the program are from June 2009. They show, as we would expect, only a modest increase in the program's enrollment.

In ruling on our statement, Obama is correct to claim credit for signing the Children's Health Insurance Program into law after Bush had vetoed it. But he was exaggerating by using the 4 million estimate prematurely. It will take awhile for the program to reach its projected enrollment. So we rate his statement Half True.","[('\nU.S. House of Representatives,  Roll call vote for SCHIP  , Jan. 14, 2009\n\nWashington Post, ""  House Votes to Expand Child Health Insurance  ,"" Jan. 14, 2009\n\nWhite House Web site,  CHIP  , accessed Feb. 4, 2009\n\nThomas,  SCHIP legislation  , accessed Feb. 4, 2009\n\nCongressional Budget Office,  CBO\'s Estimate of the Effects on Direct Spending and Revenues of the House Amendments to the Senate Amendments to H.R. 976, the Children\'s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2007,  Sept. 25, 2007.\n\nCongressional Budget Office, H.R. 2, Children\'s Health Insurance Program Reauthorization Act of 2009, Feb. 11, 2009\n\nKaiser Family Foundation, Monthly CHIP enrollment, accessed Oct. 28, 2010', 'http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll016.xml')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/28/barack-obama/obama-said-he-got-health-care-insurance-4-million-/

Barack Obama says current financial recovery has been less expensive than S&L cleanup of '80s
","
During his Oct. 27, 2010, interview on Comedy Central's The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, President Barack Obama defended the actions taken by the federal government to stabilize the financial crisis -- the source of much voter unhappiness on the campaign trail this year.

Obama said, ""If you look at how we have handled this financial crisis -- if you had told me two years ago that we're going to be able to stabilize the system, stabilize the stock market, stabilize the economy, and by the way, at the end of this thing, it will cost less than 1 percent of GDP, where the (1980s savings and loan) crisis cost us 2.5 percent of our entire economy -- a much smaller crisis -- I'd say, 'We'll take that,' because we saved taxpayers a whole lot of money.""

That's a striking comparison, so we immediately thought it deserved a fact-check.

After a bit of research, we located the federal report that made that exact comparison. It was an October 2010 document from the Treasury Department titled, ""Troubled Asset Relief Program: A Two Year Retrospective."" The TARP, as the program is more commonly known, was created under President George W. Bush in the fall of 2008 to head off what policymakers and business leaders feared was a serious threat to the stability of the nation's financial system.

Initially, independent observers projected that TARP would cost $350 billion or more, but the October 2010 report estimates that the total cost for TARP and related programs will be far lower -- about $29 billion.

""We currently expect that the overall direct fiscal cost of all our financial interventions will be less than 1 percent of GDP,"" the report said. Using the $29 billion figure would easily make the 1 percent cutoff, since GDP for 2009 was just over $14 trillion.

For the purpose of context, the report adds that ""this result is notable compared to past systemic financial crises. An International Monetary Fund study found that the average net fiscal cost of resolving roughly 40 banking crises since 1970 was 13 percent of GDP. And according to the Government Accountability Office, the net fiscal cost of cleaning up the U.S. savings and loan crisis was 2.4 percent of GDP.""

We located the original IMF study cited in the Treasury report and found that it offers two estimates, using different methodology, of the pricetag for the savings and loan crisis, which occurred when thrifts, under lax regulation, made a series of risky investments that eventually turned bad and left depositors holding the bag. One estimate in the IMF report is 2.4 percent, which is very close to what Obama said. The other is 3.2 percent. Since Obama was satisfied with the lower cost estimate -- which wouldn't be in his interest in making this kind of comparison -- then we'll stipulate to using that estimate.

So, Obama can point to a credible source for his statistical comparison. But we still think it's worth a closer look at the context behind the comparison. Here are two broad issues that we think are important to keep in mind:

• The 1 percent may not include all costs. The Treasury report includes the cost of TARP outlays to support banks, carmakers and the housing sector, as well as TARP and Treasury Department funds used to shore up the troubled insurer AIG.

However, it acknowledges several other types of outlays that are not included in its calculations, and adding in these costs would increase the total burden. ""Outside of TARP, we expect to incur substantial losses from Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac (Government Sponsored Enterprises, or GSEs), through capital injections from Treasury to the GSEs through the Preferred Stock Purchase Agreements,"" the report says.

The report adds that some of these additional losses would be made up by gains elsewhere. One source of expected income stems from authority provided by the Housing and Economic Recovery Act, under which Treasury purchased more than $200 billion in mortgage‐backed securities guaranteed by the GSEs. ""Those investments are generating notable returns,"" the report said. ""In addition, as a result of its emergency financial programs, remittances from Federal Reserve operations to the Federal Budget have increased sharply in 2009 and 2010, and they are projected to remain elevated for some time. While considerable uncertainty remains, revenues from these two sources will significantly offset to likely losses elsewhere.""

Also not included in the cost is the added deposit insurance payments under the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. The widely popular decision to increase the level of assets protected by the FDIC from $100,000 to $250,000 means that taxpayers are now on the hook for greater payouts when banks fail.

And unlike during the S&L crisis, the behind-the-scenes role of the Federal Reserve has been huge in the post-2008 recovery. After the 2008 crisis, the Fed acted in a variety of ways to stabilize various financial markets -- securing loans, for instance, or making implicit guarantees of purchases. This amounted to a ""shadow budget,"" says Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- that is, one that's not officially on the books but which has consequences elsewhere in the economy.

Meanwhile, the report acknowledges additional, intangible costs to the financial crisis that are hard to factor into any calculation.

""Our estimates do not reflect the full economic and fiscal costs of this crisis,"" the report said, ""whether measured in the millions of Americans still searching for work, the lost income for business, or the impact of the recession on federal and state budgets.""

Indeed, one obvious exclusion is that the Treasury report doesn't count the cost of the economic stimulus bill, originally estimated at $787 billion. On one level, that may be wise, since it's a cleaner way to compare the current recovery efforts to the S&L debacle, given that the earlier episode was essentially a banking crisis, not an economy-wide crisis. On the other hand, the president's statement -- which included the words ""stabilize the economy"" -- seems to suggest a broader interpretation that includes the cost of the stimulus.

Put all of this together and you have a lot of different ways to calculate the numbers. ""There are so many variables on either side that it's impossible to say whether you can really compare the costs"" of the two episodes, said Kathleen Day, a former journalist and author of S&L Hell: The People and the Politics Behinid the $1 Trillion Savings and Loan Scandal.

While we think the statistic Obama used is legitimate, it's more the start of the argument than the end of it. And it omits a number of costs that reasonable people might think should be included.

• The figure Obama cited is a snapshot in time, but the costs are not over yet. To take but one example: The Treasury estimate relies on the assumption that the value of the federal government's investments -- which are effectively keeping down the TARP's cost -- remain stable rather than declining.

""We expect that TARP investments in the banks and the credit market programs will be profitable,"" the report says. ""The recently announced restructuring of AIG will accelerate the government’s exit on terms that are likely to lead to an overall profit on the government’s support for AIG, including the value of Treasury’s interests in AIG held outside of TARP.""

That may turn out to be true -- but it also may not. And if it doesn't, taxpayers could be on the hook for higher costs.

In fact, if Obama had made the comparison much earlier in the crisis, the federal government would have been on the hook ""for a potentially enormous bill,"" said Arthur E. Wilmarth Jr., a law professor at George Washington University who specializes in business and finance. ""It is fortunate that the ultimate bill will probably turn out to be much lower than the worst-case-scenario."" By the same token, he said, troubles in the housing market could increase the cost of recovery efforts within another year or two. ""In my opinion, it is far too early to conclude that we have successfully contained and resolved the financial crisis.""

So where does this leave us? Obama has repeated a defensible estimate of the cost of the two financial crises. But there are lots of other estimates that would be equally if not more valid, and those wouldn't be as favorable to the White House's case. The figures Obama cited don't include many of the ancillary (and often intangible) costs of the recovery, and there's no way of knowing for sure that current cost estimates won't go up in future years. On balance, we rate his comment Half True.","[('\nBarack Obama, interview on Comedy Central\'s The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, Oct. 27, 2010\n\nU.S. Treasury Department, ""Troubled Asset Relief Program: A Two Year Retrospective,"" October 2010\n\nInternational Monetary Fund, ""The Length and Cost of Banking Crises,"" March 1999\n\nBureau of Economic Analysis, historical table for U.S. GDP, accessed Oct. 28, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Arthur E.

Obama says most job losses occurred before his economic policies took hold
","
President Barack Obama had jobs on his mind when he sat down Oct. 27, 2010, for a pre-election interview on Comedy Central's The Daily Show  with Jon Stewart. 
Under questioning from Stewart, Obama came back to a familiar theme: When he took office, he inherited a mess. 
""We lost 4 million jobs before I was sworn in; 750,000 the month I was sworn in; 600,000, the month after that; 600,000 the month after that. So most of the jobs that we lost were lost before the economic policies we put in place had any effect.""

Candidates have sparred endlessly over who deserves the blame for the nation’s high unemployment rate -- 9.6 percent in the latest tally. After the Daily Show interview, one of our readers asked us to check Obama's numbers. So we decided to take a look.

Obama didn't give a time frame for the 4 million lost jobs other than to say the losses occurred before he took office. We checked with the Bureau of Labor Statistics, official keeper of the jobs statistics, to see if the numbers matched up in some way. 
We found a match: Looking at BLS data on seasonally adjusted non-farm employment from December 2007, when the recession officially began, to January 2009, the month before the stimulus was enacted (a 13-month period), the jobs number declined by 4.4 million. So Obama’s first number was right, although he could have been clearer about the time frame. 
When he refers to his economic policies, we presume he is referring to his main economic stimulus, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. It passed in February 2009, but it took several months before the impact of its spending was felt in the economy. 
Job loss didn’t stop, but Obama is right that it slowed down. In the 19 months from February 2009 through September 2010, the month of the most recent preliminary data, the overall job decline in the private and public sectors was 2.6 million. And the number of jobs lost per month has declined from around 700,000 a month at the beginning of the administration to months in which there were small net gains. Since May, however, the losses -- albeit smaller ones -- have returned, giving Republicans fresh ammunition. For example, payroll employment dropped 57,000 between July and August 2010. 
""I watched the president on Stewart’s show last night, and I thought his basic point about the timing of the employment losses was correct and ought to be noncontroversial,"" Gary Burtless, a labor markets expert at the centrist-to-liberal Brookings Institution said in an e-mail. 
There's still plenty to debate about the stimulus and its impact on the economy, and the recent reversal of job gains is troubling. But the numbers support Obama's statement, so we rate it True.","[('\n\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics Employment, Hours and Earnings from the Current Employment Statistics survey (National)', 'http://data.bls.gov/PDQ/servlet/SurveyOutputServlet'), ('\nE-mail from Gary Burtless, Senior Fellow, Economics, Brookings Institution.', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/28/barack-obama/obama-says-most-job-loss-occurred-his-economic-pol/

Jeff Brandes accuses incumbent state Rep. Bill Heller of supporting taxes
","
Republican Jeff Brandes wants voters to believe two-term state Rep. Bill Heller will be trouble for their pocketbooks and kids' future.

A 30-second Brandes television ad opens at a school, where two girls recognize Brandes from other ads before cutting to the candidate:

""My opponent Bill Heller thinks government is the answer to everything. So he raises taxes. Property taxes. Small business taxes. He even wants to tax the Internet. That's just wrong."" 
The ad, produced with help from the Republican Party of Florida, warns that Heller will drive up taxes and pile debt on children if the Democrat wins the Nov. 2, 2010, election for House District 52. 
""Mr. Heller said no to balancing the federal budget, that puts more debt on our kids.

Florida voters are in a foul mood over taxes and spending, so we decided to check Brandes' claims about Heller's support of tax increases.

Brandes cited an array of votes, including a referendum in Pinellas County and five votes in the Florida House:

On property taxes, Heller did support a 2004 referendum in Pinellas County to raise property taxes to increase teacher pay by providing $26 million at the time in additional revenue. Voters overwhelmingly passed it. Heller wasn't in the House then, but he chaired the campaign supporting the measure. The measure raised taxes 50 cents for every $1,000 of taxable value. At the time, the owner of a $150,000 home with a $25,000 homestead exemption would pay an extra $62.50 a year.

However, Heller also voted for a 2007 measure that voters later approved to cut property taxes by doubling the $25,000 homestead exemption. It was estimated to drop the average tax bill $240 at the time, though savings depended on individual property assessments. (Heller earlier had voted against an initial version of the bill, and a judge later threw it out.) 
On businesses, Heller voted for Senate Bill 810 in 2009 that extended unemployment compensation for Floridians up to 20 weeks. It also raised the tax that businesses have to pay into the fund for unemployment assistance. After Republicans successfully turned back attempts to accept $444 million in stimulus money, the bill passed with a 117-0 vote.

Heller also has supported legislation imposing a state sales tax on Internet transactions. Brick and mortar businesses have to charge sales tax, but Florida does not collect it from online shops such as Amazon. It amounts to hundreds of millions in lost revenue. But the bills in the House and Senate died in committee in 2010 with little debate.

But the other claims that Brandes makes are less grounded in reality.

Heller voted against a federal balanced budget measure in 2010, but it was a non-binding resolution asking Congress to call a constitutional convention for an amendment requiring a balanced federal budget. The measure carried no weight, as the Florida House doesn't have any control over the federal budget, let alone did it add debt on children. The resolution passed the House, 70-42, and the Senate, 28-12. It did not require the governor's signature.

While Heller did vote in 2009 and 2010 against budget bills that included annual 7 percent pay cuts for lawmakers, he actually voted for the cut in 2010 when it was approved as an amendment. The amendment for the 2009 cut was approved without a roll call vote, meaning it had little controversy. The pay cuts were approved in the budget and were signed into law by Gov. Charlie Crist each year.

So while Heller has supported tax increases, Brandes inaccurately describes the gravity and actual effect of Heller's votes on the federal budget. We rate Brandes' claims on taxes Mostly True.","[('\nJeff Brandes campaign ad, ""Dad,"" Oct. 12, 2010, paid for by the Republican Party of Florida\n\nInterviews, Jeff Brandes, Oct. 26 and Oct. 27, 2010\n\nInterview, Bill Heller, Oct. 26, 2010\n\nFlorida House of Representatives, voting records for 2007, 2009 and 2010\n\n""Voters approve higher tax to help teachers, schools,"" St. Petersburg Times, by Tom Tobin, Nov. 3, 2004.\n\n""House rejects stimulus,"" St. Petersburg Times, by Alex Leary, April 30, 2009.\n\n""Florida House District 52,"" St. Petersburg Times, Oct. 22, 2008.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCqVk9aAh6k&NR=1')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/28/jeff-brandes/jeff-brandes-accuses-incumbent-state-rep-bill-hell/

Jeff Brandes says government regulations may close small business
","
In a television ad, Republican Jeff Brandes touts his ability to save jobs in Florida House District 52 with the story of a boat cleaning company threatened with closure by over-the-top government regulation.

""Small business is where the jobs are, like a 30-year-old boat cleaning business employing 18 people,"" Brandes says as he stands near a pier. ""But their jobs are on the line, all because government essentially says if they don't hire a lifeguard to watch their workers, they can't stay open. Even when the water's only a few feet deep.""

The screen flashes briefly to the words ""Government: Do it our way or else.""

But is the government really forcing a business to hire a lifeguard or shut down?

The case in question involves Scuba Clean Inc., a St. Petersburg company that earlier this year was cited for 19 violations by the U.S Occupational Safety and Health Administration. The company faces more than $200,000 in penalties.

OSHA did indeed demand that the company hire a trained tender, someone to stand watch over divers for safety, and the fine for that violation is $49,000. A tender is generally similar to a lifeguard but with much more extensive training.

Owner Phil Secord disputed the violations and contested the fines, but said he is closing his company over the citations. He laid off at least one worker, and turned over his customers to others who work as contract workers, he said.

The three most serious fines stemmed from allegations that the company had workers in the water who weren't trained under the standards for commercial diving, and for using air through a line from the surface without a tender.

However, there were 16 other unrelated violations alleged, including the company not having a supervisor on site, not having written safety procedures and equipment, and improper storage of chlorine and other chemicals.

Secord said the government is indeed killing him with unneeded regulation. For example, he said his divers mostly clean boats in waters four to six feet deep at local marinas. Therefore, he said, employing a tender would be unnecessary and expensive. His case is headed to a Nov. 5 settlement hearing.

It is true that OSHA rules don’t discriminate between people cleaning boat hulls in shallow water and commercial divers who work in deep water to do underwater construction, according to commercial diving trainers.

""It's not a gray area. It's cut and dry. And it's a federal regulation,"" said Geoff Thielst, a 30-year commercial diver and program director of marine technology training at Santa Barbara City College.

But Brandes said the business was threatened ""all because"" Scuba Clean didn't hire a lifeguard – the tender. The bulk of the alleged violations and fines that have put this business' future in doubt involved training of divers, equipment and safety practices, not just the absence of a lifeguard.

Therefore, we rule this claim Half True. ","[('\nInterview, Geoff Thielst, director of marine technology training, Santa Barbara City College, Oct. 25, 2010\n\nInterview, Michael Pauley, admissions representative and commerical diving instructor, Commercial Dive Academy International, Oct. 20, 2010\n\nInterview and e-mail, Melik Ahmir-abdul, spokesman, U.S. Occupational Safety and HealthReview Commission, Oct. 21, 2010\n\nCitation, Occupational Safety and Health Administration, June 9, 2010\n\nCitation, Occpational Safety and Health Administration, June 9, 2010\n\n""St. Petersburg boat cleaning company cited for health and safety violations,"" St. Petersburg Times, by Kameel Stanley, June 11, 2010\n\n""Commercial Diver Training -- Minimum Standards,"" American National Standards Institute, 2009\n\nJeff Brandes campaign TV ad ""Scuba"", Sept. 26, 2010', 'https://docs.google.com/leaf?id=1tYtc0G6orcMkKy299b0OCMW7IGgB6eAgvreN5BZXo4BzcVtsEZGWLeOrvb2K&hl=en')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/28/jeff-brandes/jeff-brandes-says-government-regulations-may-close/

Rick Boucher says Morgan Griffith fought to send education money from Southwest Virginia to Northern Virginia
","
Folks in Southwest Virginia often feel forgotten by the power brokers elsewhere in the state. The region has many of the poorest public school districts in the state and residents often feel wealthier areas of the state get a disproportionate share of government help.

So heads turn when a Southwest Virginia politician is accused of taking money from local classrooms and giving it to prosperous Northern Virginia. That’s the charge U.S. Rep. Rick Boucher, a Democrat, has launched against Republican challenger Morgan Griffith in Virginia’s 9th Congressional District race.

""Morgan Griffith fought for a plan that would have taken money away from our schools and given it to Northern Virginia schools instead,"" says a Boucher TV ad that began running this week.

Did Griffith really push for a reverse Robin Hood policy that hurt his constituents? We checked the facts.

The Boucher ad cites a February 18, 2010, story in the Roanoke Times. The article provided an update on the ongoing debate over changing the formula for providing state aid to public schools.

The formula is based on the wealth of localities. The poorest school systems receive up to 85 percent of their education dollars from the state; the richest systems get as little as 20 percent. State law requires to formula to be calibrated every two years.

For decades, the formula worked against Northern Virginia because soaring real estate prices and development boosted the region’s wealth. In contrast, the formula helped Southwest Virginia,  where the tax base is small and home prices are modest. So Northern Virginia tax revenues went to Richmond and, under the education formula, much of the money went to Southwest Virginia schools.

But the recession changed the balance in the 2010 calibration. Real estate prices plummeted in Northern Virginia, which sharply lowered the region’s wealth and made it qualify for an additional $134 million for schools. The additional money came at the expense of other regions of the state.

Last winter, outgoing Gov. Tim Kaine made an unprecedented recommendation to skip the 2010 reset. Northern Virginia legislators were enraged and Griffith -- as well as incoming Gov. Bob McDonnell -- sided with them. Griffith pointed out that that formula has almost always helped Southwest Virginia.

""If we start saying when it benefits another region of the state that we don’t like it, then in a couple of years they may do away with it and we’ll be getting the short end of the stick,"" he told The Roanoke Times. ""It’s helped us for 30 years. It hurts us this year. But I suspect it will help us for 30 years into the future, and messing with it and playing games with it in a single year is foolish.""

When Griffith made the comment, the 27 school systems in the 9th Congressional District stood to lose a total of $261,000 in state funding over two years. That’s a tiny portion of the $1.25 billion sent to the district -- about 1/50th of 1 percent.  Some of the lost money would have gone to Northern Virginia, but its impossible to say how much because there were a few localities outside Northern Virginia that also would gain from the recalculation.

Did Griffith actually fight to reset the formula, as the Boucher ad says? When we asked Boucher’s spokesperson for proof, she referred us to the Feb. 18 story in The Roanoke Times. Although the article quotes Griffith, it makes no suggestion Griffith was leading a reset effort. We searched the archives of four other Virginia daily newspapers and couldn’t find a single story that implied Griffith was going to war on the issue.

In March, the General Assembly approved a state budget that reset the school formula. It also allocated funds to cover most of the losses localities would suffer in the redistribution of money over the next two years. Schools in the 9th Congressional District will wind up losing about $65,000, some of which will go to Northern Virginia. Griffith, along with many other Southwest Virginia lawmakers, voted for the budget.

Let’s go back to Boucher’s ad. The 9th District congressman says Griffith ""fought for a plan to take money away from our schools and give it to Northern Virginia schools.""

Griffith was on record supporting the reset of the school formula, but Boucher fails to prove that Griffith ""fought for"" it. And contrary to the implication of the ad that the district would suffer a significant loss of education money, the amount lost from the 9th District is actually a small fraction of 1 percent. We find Boucher’s claim to be Barely True.

Barack Obama tells Jon Stewart the health care bill cuts the deficit by over $1 trillion dollars
","
In an interview with President Barack Obama on Oct. 27, 2010, Daily Show host Jon Stewart summed up the president's first two years in office, saying that despite a campaign that promised audacious change, ""legislatively, it has felt timid at times."" Stewart cited the Democratic health care law as an example.

Obama scoffed at ""this notion that health care was timid.""

""You've got 30 million people who are going to get health insurance as a consequence of this,"" Obama said. ""You've got a patient's bill of rights that makes sure insurance companies can't drop you when you get sick if you've been paying premiums, that makes sure there aren't lifetime limits, that makes sure kids who don't have health insurance can stay on their parents insurance until they are 26. And cuts the deficit by over a trillion dollars. This is, what I think most people would say, is as significant a piece of legislation as we have seen in this country's history.""

On the campaign trail, many Republican candidates have lumped the health care bill in with the economic stimulus as examples of Obama administration initiatives driving the country deeper into debt. So Obama's claim that the health care bill would actually cut the deficit by over $1 trillion dollars is significant.

It's a claim Obama has made many times, and we first weighed in on it when Obama said in his State of the Union speech on Jan. 27, 2010, that health care reform ""would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades."" So then it was ""as much as"" $1 trillion and this time it was ""over $1 trillion dollars.""

But the substance is the same: Obama is in pretty speculative territory here.

Obama is correct that the Congressional Budget Office, with its teams of economists and legislative analysts, has found that the health care bill passed in March not only pays for itself but brings down the deficit. That's because the plan includes new tax provisions and cost-savings measures to pay for its spending.

The CBO found the health care reform bill would reduce the deficit by $143 billion over 10 years.

So how does Obama get to over $1 trillion? He's looking way down the road, at a 20-year estimate, which gets highly speculative.

The CBO usually only calculates the impact of legislation's cost over 10 years. But the agency will create calculations for a longer period if Congress requests it.

The CBO doesn't like to calculate longer than 10 years because many variables are difficult to predict. Here's what the CBO had to say about calculating health reform's effect on the deficit between 2020 and 2030:

""A detailed year-by-year projection for years beyond 2019, like those that CBO prepares for the 10-year budget window, would not be meaningful because the uncertainties involved are simply too great. Among other factors, a wide range of changes could occur — in people’s health, in the sources and extent of their insurance coverage, and in the delivery of medical care (such as advances in medical research, technological developments, and changes in physicians’ practice patterns) — that are likely to be significant but are very difficult to predict, both under current law and under any proposal.""

In fact, the CBO wouldn't even present its findings as a straightforward dollar number, but instead as a percentage of the gross domestic product, or GDP, which is a number that measures a nation's economic output. The CBO said that over the second 10 years, the Senate proposal should reduce the deficit ""in a broad range around one half percent of GDP.""

Obama's $1 trillion figure is an extrapolation of what one-half of 1 percent of GDP might be. According to the CBO's latest numbers, GDP will be $22.5 trillion in 2020. You can do a rough estimate and find that you could get to roughly $1 trillion over 20 years.

Back in January, we ran all this by Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst at the conservative Heritage Institution. He said that the numbers aren't phony, but that Obama tries to put a hard number on something that is inherently unpredictable.

""You really can't model GDP 15 years from now,"" he said. Riedl also said he thought Congress would not be able to stick to some of the spending reductions contained in the Democratic proposals, especially in regards to Medicare.

We also spoke to Jim Horney, director of federal fiscal policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, who called Obama's $1 trillion figure "" a little speculative.""

""But if you say in your speech it will reduce the deficit one-quarter to one-half percent of GDP, no one listening to the State of the Union would have a clue as to what you meant, and it would make it sound like a tiny amount when it's not,"" Horney said.

Bottom line, Obama is presenting a highly speculative number as a hard fact. The CBO believes the health care bill will continue to improve the deficit in second 10 years. In an Oct. 22, 2010 presentation on the economic effects of the health care bill, CBO director Douglas W. Elmendorf said the legislation sets up a number of experiments in delivery and payment systems, but ""it is unclear how successful the experiments will be."" For that reason, and others, the CBO noted that the uncertainties involved are too great to create detailed projections. And so now, as then, we rate Obama's statement Half True.","[('\nThe Daily Show website, Interview with President Barack Obama, Oct. 27, 2010', 'http://www.thedailyshow.com/full-episodes/wed-october-27-2010-barack-obama'), ('\nPolitiFact, ""Health care reform \'would bring down the deficit by as much as $1 trillion over the next two decades,\'"" by Angie Drobnic Holan, Feb. 1, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nCongressional Budget Office, Presentation at the University of Southern California: ""Economic Effects of the March Health Legislation,"" by CBO director Douglas W.

Morgan Griffith says Rick Boucher “helped write” the cap-and-trade bill
","The cap-and-trade bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions is dominating the race for the 9th Congressional District seat out in the heart of coal country.

Republican challenger Morgan Griffith is pounding Democratic incumbent Rick Boucher for voting in favor of cap-and-trade. Griffith claims the legislation will kill jobs in the district, already beset with high unemployment.

A recent Griffith TV ad features a repeated clip of President Barack Obama professing, ""I love Rick Boucher."" The narrator says: ""Love the Obama Washington agenda? Rick Boucher does. Obama’s cap-and-trade plan kills our jobs and raises electricity costs. Boucher helped write it.""    

Cap-and-trade has stalled in the U.S. Senate. But PolitiFact Virginia wanted to examine what role Boucher had, if any, in drafting the legislation.  

What exactly is cap-and-trade?

Under the bill, the government would set a limit on how much carbon companies, such as electric utilities or manufacturers, can emit. The government would then issue permits for emissions to companies and allow them to buy and sell the permits with each other. Supporters say the policy would create a free-market system that will reduce emissions. Opponents argue that that it will kill jobs that rely on coal and other traditional fuel sources.

Griffith bases his claim that Boucher helped write the bill to on a story on news website SWVA Today in which Boucher defended his vote for cap-and-trade and acknowledged having a part in amending the bill.

Asked to clarify his role, Boucher explained that the alternative to cap-and-trade was to leave regulation to the Environmental Protection Agency, which he said  would be devastating for companies that rely on coal and their employees.

""That would be the worst possible outcome for the coal industry, coal jobs, for electric utilities that burn coal and electric consumers,"" Boucher told PolitiFact Virginia.

As a senior member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, Boucher said he amended the legislation at the request of the coal and electric power industries in an effort to minimize the impact on coal jobs.  

Boucher’s changes included emissions credits that ensured that power plants could continue to use coal so long as they find ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

""It’s certainly accurate to say that I was deeply involved in the process, but the ad is extraordinarily misleading because it suggests that I was doing this because it was something that the President of the Speaker of the House wanted,"" Boucher said. ""In fact, I took them on to get the deal that I got for coal.""

Boucher’s intentions were defended by Phil Smith, a spokesman for the United Mine Workers of America, who said the congressman went to bat for coal.

""The truth of the matter is that when that bill was originally introduced, there wasn’t one single dime in there in support of the coal industry,"" he said. ""What Rick Boucher did was to get involved in the negotiations and put $180 billion into it for coal.""   

Smith added: ""Without him getting involved, the handwriting would be on the wall for the coal industry at this point.""  

Melissa McHenry with American Electric Power said that the company was supportive of those changes that Boucher had made to cap-and-trade.

""It supports continued use of coal,"" she said. ""The alternative is EPA regulation and he recognized that that would have a significant impact to the detriment of the coal industry.""  

Let’s look back at the details.

Did Boucher help write cap-and-trade? Absolutely. But he did so to add protections for the coal industry and the jobs it provides in his district.

The ad implies that Boucher contributed to a job-killing bill, but his motive was to actually protect those jobs. So while the statement is accurate that he helped write it, the ad leaves out important details. We find the claim Half True.","[('Morgan Griffith for Congress, ""Obama loves Rick Boucher"", Sept. 20, 2010.\n\nInterview with Rick Boucher, Oct. 25, 2010.\n\nThe Energy and Commerce Committee,summary of provisions in HR 2454, accessed Oct. 25, 2010.\n\nThe Richmond Times-Dispatch, ""Boucher, Griffith clash over cap-and-trade legislation at 9th District debate"", Oct. 22, 2010.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal, ""In Virginia House race, Cap and Trade matter"", Oct. 25, 2010.\n\nSWVA Today, ""Boucher defends position on cap and trade"", Feb. 23, 2010.\n\nInterview with Melissa McHenry, American Electric Power, Oct. 25, 2010. \xa0\n\nInterview with Phil Smith, United Mine Workers of America, Oct. 25, 2010.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B7t8b42ZiTo&feature=player_embedded')]",/factchecks/2010/oct/28/morgan-griffith/morgan-griffith-says-rick-boucher-helped-write-cap/

Strickland claim about Kasich giving secret bonuses to corporate friends relies on edited footage
","
Taking words out of context is an old practice in political advertising.

John Kasich, Republican candidate for governor, makes it almost too easy.

A case in point is ""New Plan,"" a TV ad for Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland. It says Kasich ""wants to use our tax dollars to bring his corporate friends to Ohio to be in charge of jobs."" The campaign's online posting for the ad goes even further: ""Congressman Kasich wants to use our tax dollars to give secret bonuses to his corporate friends.""

As evidence, it uses video of Kasich talking with reporters after an Aug. 17 news conference announcing his proposal to replace the Ohio Department of Development with JobsOhio, a nonprofit corporation operated in large part by private money.

The 30-second spot opens by saying that Kasich, as a congressman, ""outsourced our jobs and made millions in bonuses on Wall Street.""

PolitiFact Ohio previously examined the charge about outsourcing jobs and rated it False.

The claim about ""millions in bonuses"" is unproven and speculative. Kasich has not disclosed his pay or bonuses from eight years as a managing director for Lehman Brothers, except for a tax return showing he made $182,692 in salary and a $432,000 bonus in 2008.

""Now,"" the ad says next, ""Kasich wants to use our tax dollars to bring his corporate friends to Ohio to be in charge of jobs.""

Then it shows him saying: ""We won't have any pay restrictions there. If they deserve a bonus, we'll give them a bonus. You all are familiar with bonuses. We will not require them to disclose their bonus.""

The ad asks: ""Wall Street CEO's being paid secret bonuses? Isn't that what got us into trouble in the first place?""

Kasich, on video, chortles, ""It's going to be fantastic.""

PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look at the claim posted with the video; that ""Congressman Kasich wants to use our tax dollars to give secret bonuses to his corporate friends.""

We found a somewhat different sense of his comments and proposal emerges from unedited footage of the media scrum. It was posted on OhioCapitalBlog by Marc Kovac, bureau chief for Dix Newspapers and Youngstown Vindicator.

On it, Kasich says JobsOhio would be ""run like a business,"" with the governor as chairman of an appointed board of directors. Staff workers would not be public employees, to avoid civil service restrictions on pay.

""We won’t have any pay restrictions there,"" Kasich says. ""We’re going to pay them on the basis of how they produce. If they deserve a bonus, we’ll give them a bonus. You all are familiar with bonuses. So anyway, it’s going to be professionalized.""

He gushes that ""it's going to be fantastic"" more than a minute later, after saying, ""We'll have recruiters go all over the country"" to find qualified workers.

His comment that ""you all are familiar with bonuses"" is a quip intended as a joke for reporters and a clutch of nodding aides, and it draws a laugh.

The line that ""we will not require them to disclose their bonus"" is edited in, from minutes later in the session. Kasich says it with a straight face, but campaign press secretary Rob Nichols said, ""It was absolutely a joke. He has been asked about it time and again, and he said the group will be transparent.""

In fact, Kasich's tendency to use deadpan irony or sarcasm is seen more clearly when a reporter asks if the nonprofit group would hold open meetings.

""No, no, no, it's going to be completely secret, it's going to be a secret society like Skull and Bones,"" Kasich responds. Then he adds, ""No, we have an obligation to let people know what's going on. ... It will have a high degree of transparency.""

Kasich admitted that privacy issues were not settled. Questions have been raised whether the state can become an owner of a corporation and whether it is legal or constitutional to privatize a government duty and mingle tax dollars with private money.

He does not suggest paying more than ""necessary expenses"" to board members, who he says would be corporate CEOs.

The nonprofit’s operating staff would be eligible for bonuses and be paid ""very competitive salaries,"" he says. ""We're not hiring political friends or contributors or any of that other crap that's been going on in this state. ... We don't have time for political hacks, which I think we've filled these operations with for too darn long.""

While the words in the ad did come out of Kasich’s mouth, they are from edited video that links statements out of context. Without that context, viewers have no way of knowing that some of the lines clearly were said in jest, and they are instead presented as if Kasich is serious.

And Kasich  clearly says during his conversation with reporters that bonuses would go to workers for JobsOhio and that they could not be secret, but would instead be public.

Taking comments from different parts of conversation and linking them together to bolster a message is more than just false, it’s deceptive to a point of ridiculous.

For a statement like this -- ""Kasich wants to use our tax dollars to give secret bonuses to his corporate friends"" -- there’s only one answer: Pants on Fire!","[('\nStrickland ad ""New Plan""\n\nStrickland ad posting\n\nOhioCapitalBlog video, Kasich with reporters\n\nPlain Dealer, ""Ohio Republican governor candidate Kasich says he will privatize the state\'s economic development efforts,"" Aug. 18, 2010\n\nPolitiFact Ohio, ""Gov.

Group says Wisconsin Republican Assembly candidates want to privatize Social Security
","
Worried about the future of Social Security? A liberal Wisconsin group is betting you are -- or that it can make you worried before election day.

The Greater Wisconsin Committee and its Greater Wisconsin Political Fund are using mailers and radio ads to target Republican candidates in key 2010 races for the Wisconsin Assembly. Democrats outnumber Republicans there, 52 to 46, with one independent.

The central theme of the attacks: The GOP Assembly candidates, like their Washington counterparts, want to privatize Social Security.

Yes, Social Security, that venerable federal program -- one the state Assembly has no control over.

The wording of the attacks varies, but the claims are all similar to this one against Republican Travis Tranel, who is challenging Rep. Phil Garthwaite, D-Dickeyville.

""Travis Tranel,"" a mail piece says, ""sides with those who want to privatize Social Security -- and risk our retirements on Wall Street.""

Lest anyone miss the point, the flier includes a man -- presumably a fat-cat Wall Street banker or investor -- lighting his cigar with a Social Security card that’s been set aflame.

There’s also an image of a magnifying glass inviting readers to ""check the facts.""

Why, thank you. We will.

Asked to elaborate on her organization’s claims, Greater Wisconsin Committee executive director Michelle McGrorty offered two main points: 

At PolitiFact Wisconsin, this is familiar ground.

We gave Pants on Fire ratings to claims that GOP congressional candidates backed privatizing Social Security, when Democrats provided no proof beyond a sliced-and-diced statement and a two-word answer taken out of context.

Now state Assembly candidates? This could get good.

Let’s start with Ryan’s ""Roadmap,"" a plan that has helped put Ryan on the political map, but one that does not have universal support among the GOP leadership in Washington.

PolitiFact National examined the roadmap in August 2010, after President Barack Obama alluded to it in saying GOP leaders are backing privatization plans that would tie Social Security benefits ""to the whims of Wall Street traders and the ups and downs of the stock market.""  

If adopted, Ryan’s plan would enable workers under 55 to, voluntarily, invest a portion of their Social Security taxes in funds managed by the government. As Politifact National noted: ""That's a far cry from privatizing the entirety of Social Security.""

So, the Greater Wisconsin Committee is starting off on the wrong road with its claim about the roadmap.

As for the ties to Ryan, this is old-fashioned guilt by association ... and there ain’t much association, at least when it comes to the Social Security issue. 

We could go on.

A GWC radio ad says some tea party candidates want to eliminate Social Security and ""we have one right here, this guy Jack Cummings."" Cummings, an Endeavor farmer, is challenging first-term Rep. Fred Clark, D-Baraboo. McGrorty’s defense: The ad talks about a number of issues and doesn’t say that Cummings wants to eliminate Social Security.

Hmmm .... ""We have one right here.""

(Assembly Democrat Ted Zigmunt of Francis Creek also uses a flier to accuse his Republican opponent, Andre Jacque, of supporting privatization of Social Security. A campaign aide cited Jacque’s endorsement by the Republican Liberty Caucus, but no statement Jacque has made about Social Security.)

How do the targeted candidates respond to all of this?

Brian Pleva, a spokesman for the Wisconsin Republican Assembly Campaign Committee, said none of them supports -- or has made statements in support of -- privatizing or eliminating Social Security.

Why would they? They’re not running for Congress.

In any case, we could not find any such statements. And the Greater Wisconsin Committee could not provide any.

Indeed, on two of the fliers, one of the check-our-facts citations is a report by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington. The report predicts cuts in Social Security benefits would result from Ryan’s plan, but that doesn’t address the question of privatization, and the report doesn’t mention the targeted candidates.

If you’re sensing a theme here, so are we.

In targeting Republicans in races that could shift the balance of power in the state Assembly, the Greater Wisconsin Committee is taking a page from the national Democratic playbook -- and misusing it. To play to fears of seniors and others, the group labels a proposal from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, as privatizing Social Security.

Even if the plan did privatize Social Security (in our view it does not), the group has offered no evidence that the GOP Assembly candidates back it. The ""proof"" cited borders on absurd: One candidate praised Ryan, one got his picture taken with him and a third had Ryan appear at his campaign fundraiser. Is that cigar still burning?

If not, we need a light, because the ruling is Pants on Fire.","[('\nFred Clark for Assembly campaign website, bio\n\nDennis Clinard for Assembly campaign website, bio\n\nJack Cummings for Assembly campaign website,bio\n\nPhil Garthwaite for Assembly campaign website, bio\n\nHoward Marklein for Assembly campaign website, bio\n\nMark Radcliffe for Assembly campaign website, bio\n\nJohn Simonson for Assembly campaign website, bio\n\nTravis Tranel for Assembly campaign website, bio\n\nE-mail interviews with Wisconsin Republican Party spokesman Brian Pleva, Oct. 22, 25, 26 and 27, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Greater Wisconsin Committee executive director Michelle McGrorty, Oct. 25, 26 and 27, 2010\n\nE-mail interview with Wisconsin Assembly Democratic Campaign Committee director Nicholl Caruso, Oct. 27, 2010\n\nPolitiFact Wisconsin, Politician Reid Ribble wants to phase out Social Security, forcing Wisconsin seniors to fend for themselves, Sept. 19, 2010\n\nPolitiFact Wisconsin, Sean Duffy backed plan to privatize Social Security, Sept. 9, 2010\n\nMilwaukee Journal Sentinel, Ryan’s on the map, and taking heat, Sept. 9, 2010\n\nPolitiFact.com, Sen.

Group says state Senate candidate Monk Elmer voted to exceed spending caps while on Kimberly school board
","
It’s hard to confuse a Bulldog with a Papermaker. And Idaho with Wisconsin. And a school district experiencing a state of emergency with one receiving national praise.

But that’s what the American Federation for Children did in a direct mail piece sent to residents of the 1st state Senate District, which stretches from the Fox Cities northeast to include the Door County peninsula.

The seat is open after the retirement of Sen. Alan Lasee, a Republican who had held it since 1977. Seeking to replace him are Democrat Monk Elmer, a family practice physician and president of the Kimberly school board, and former state Rep. Frank Lasee, a Republican and distant relative of Alan Lasee.

The American Federation for Children, which advocates for school choice, is one of several outside groups active in the race, one of a handful that could determine control of the Senate.

The group sent out a direct mail piece headlined ""Knock Knock, Monk Elmer and Higher Taxes are Calling."" It listed a variety of complaints, each with an official-looking footnote, including this one:

""Monk Elmer just can’t stop spending ... Monk Elmer voted to exceed the spending caps.""

Among those receiving it: Elmer himself.

Elmer, president of the Kimberly school board, didn’t  recognize the name of the reporter or even the newspaper cited in the footnote: Amy Huddleston, Times-News correspondent.

With good reason: The reporter and newspaper are in Idaho.

The April 17, 2010 article from the Times-News in Twin Falls, Idaho, was about the Kimberly School District there declaring a fiscal state of emergency and approving a resolution seeking voter approval for a special $300,000 tax levy.

Yikes. Tough to campaign for higher office when you’re president of that school board.

Of the American Federation for Children, Elmer said: The group ""thinks they can put down any information they want and they don’t think anybody’s checking them.""

We left messages at the group’s national office and for former Assembly Speaker Scott Jensen, who heads the group’s state operation, but received no reply.

Elmer and the State Senate Democratic Campaign Committee complained publicly about the ad on Oct. 19, 2010. But there’s been no evidence that the group has modified the claim. Indeed, Elmer says it has shown up in other pieces of direct mail.

Of course, Elmer is doing some explaining to voters about the school board’s budgets since he’s taken over as president in Kimberly, Wis. (home of the Papermakers, population 6,146) and not Kimberly, Idaho, (Bulldogs, pop. 2,614).

The Kimberly, Wis. tax levy increased 0.2 percent to about $14.5 million in his first budget; for 2009-’10 the levy was up $1.2 million, or 8.4 percent, to $15.7 million. On Oct. 25, the board voted for a 2010-’11 tax levy of $16.67 million, up $989,000, or 6.3 percent.

Yes, tax hikes. But no vote to exceed spending caps -- and no state of emergency.

Elmer defended the tax increases, saying the district faced sharp cuts in state aid, while striving to provide excellent schools. Newsweek recently placed Kimberly (Wisconsin) on its list of the best school districts in the country (No. 1,637 out of 2,000, and 27th of the 32 state schools on the list.)

Let’s conclude with an obvious geography lesson:

In a key state Senate race, the American Federation for Children reached for a great headline and issue to use against Democratic candidate Monk Elmer. They reached all the way to Kimberly, Idaho, which is about 1,641 miles away from the home of Monk Elmer back in Kimberly, Wis. That’s about as far as that claim is from the truth. And that makes the claim ridiculous.

Basic Rights Oregon tries to tie one pollster’s anti-gay views to state Senate Republicans

Campaign donation requests say the darndest things. Take, for instance, a fresh-off-the-keyboard e-mail received from the Basic Rights Equality PAC -- the political finance arm of Basic Rights Oregon -- that ties the views of one pollster to those of the Senate Republicans.

First, the e-mail starts by quoting from a Willamette Week article:
  
""It’s hard to believe. But there it was in bold print in ‘Willamette Week’: an advisor to Oregon Senate Republicans ‘advocates death for gays.’ ""

A quick Google search, and we had before us the article with the perfectly provocative headline   ""Republican Pollster In Oregon Says Slaves ‘Well-Treated’; Advocates Death for Gays.""

According to the article, state filings showed that the campaign arm of the Senate Republicans had paid thousands of dollars to Target Market Strategies for polling over the past few years. Senate Democrats pounced when they learned that Dennis Oliver Woods, the ""company principal"" of Target Market Strategies, had published a book that included the following passages: 
""Some crimes are such a violent assault on the image of God in man or on biblical society that God stipulates that nothing less than death will satisfy His offended sense of justice."" 
And then this one: 
""In addition to murder (see Lev. 24:17), the death penalty is specified for a number of crimes. This is the ultimate form of restitution. These crimes include promotion of witchcraft…Bestiality (see Lev. 20:15), homosexuality (see Lev. 20:13), incest and adultery ..."" 
We decided to give Woods a call directly to discuss his views. He wouldn’t chat with us but instead sent us an e-mail that didn’t do much to address what he actually thought. ""My point of view is really irrelevant now since the Senate Republican caucus has dismissed me and I am no longer working for them,"" he wrote.

PolitiFact Oregon wrote him back, asking for clarification. He never responded.

To learn more, we got our hands on a copy of his book, ""Discipling the Nations,"" from which all this was excerpted.

The book says that ""Part III,"" the section excerpted in Willamette Week, ""offers God’s Blueprint for Civil Government. Chapter 7 holds forth the Word of God as the only adequate rule for civil government.""

Michael Gay, the spokesman for the Senate Republicans, says they did not know about Woods’ book, which was published more than 10 years ago and is not widely distributed. They have since stopped using his services.

""He served no advisory function to the caucus whatsoever,"" Gay said. ""He was merely a vendor who made phone calls.

""We wrote the poll questions, we told him what to ask, he was scripted.""

Maya Blackmun, a spokeswoman for Basic Rights Oregon, argues, ""(I)t's common knowledge that on political campaigns pollsters are a key player in advising and consulting on a campaign, interpreting results, providing cross tab analysis, targeting profiles, connecting messages with key audiences, etc.""

Even if Woods does believe in the death penalty for gays and even if he was an adviser to the Senate Republicans, Basic Rights Oregon asserted that Republican candidates are ""blatantly anti-gay -- even advocating violence.""

PolitiFact Oregon finds no evidence of this claim. Certainly, no member of the Republican Senate caucus has spoken in support of Woods’ views or said anything remotely similar.

Blackmun concedes that the e-mail could have done with a bit of editing. It would have been fairer, she said, had the e-mail read something to the effect of ""it’s shocking that an adviser to candidates in Oregon would be so blatantly anti-gay.""

""We made a mistake,"" Blackmun said. ""The additional words would have made it clearer.""

We find the claim that Senate Republicans are advocating violence against gays False.

"['Elections', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Did Marco Rubio flip-flop on setting Florida's presidential primary date?
","
Why should Iowa and New Hampshire get all the attention when it comes to presidential politics? 
That was the question Florida legislators were asking back in 2007, when they ignored advice from both national Republican and Democratic party leaders and moved Florida’s presidential primary date. By moving it earlier, to January 29, the idea was that presidential candidates would give more time and attention to Florida voters. 
The parties were not amused, and they sanctioned Florida delegates with a variety of penalties, both in 2008 and 2012 
More recently, though, Florida legislators have lost interest in going rogue. 
In the waning days of the 2013 Florida legislative session, lawmakers tucked a provision into an elections bill to move the primary back, so that it’s held ""on the first Tuesday that the rules of the major political parties provide for state delegations to be allocated without penalty."" 
They made the change with the support of one of Florida’s top Republicans: U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio. That jogged our memory: Wasn’t Rubio the one in favor of moving the primary up in the first place? 
We decided to investigate the matter on our Flip-O-Meter. We use the Flip-O-Meter to determine when a political official or candidate has changed position. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gaging whether they did or not. 
• • • 
A look through the archives showed Rubio promoted an early primary date as early as in March 2006. The Miami Republican was then a young state legislator, but a powerful one, as Florida’s Speaker of the House. 
""With all due respect to New Hampshire and Iowa, nowhere are you going to be on a national stage like Florida,"" Rubio told the Tampa Bay Times back then. ""You're going to get questions about Israel, Latin America, immigration. It's the old South, it's Latin, it's Midwestern, it's rural and urban."" 
Rubio included the idea in his book, 100 Innovative Ideas For Florida's Future, which became his game plan for the Florida House in 2007 and 2008, and a checklist he touted when he ran for the U.S. Senate in 2010.  (PolitiFact Florida documented the idea as No. 37 for Rubio, and marked it a promise kept.) 
Rubio won an open U.S. Senate seat in 2010, and since then he has become a rising star in the Republican Party. He’s often mentioned as potential presidential candidate in 2016 and even leads in some polls. (Yes, current polling has little predictive value for a race more than three years away.) 
While Rubio’s been out of the Florida Legislature for years now, he was still credited as a force for getting the primary moved back to a date in 2016 so that the parties don’t apply penalties to Florida delegates. 
Rubio has cited two reasons for his change in position: harsher penalties from the party, and the rise of super PACs. 
The penalties for Republicans would have been notably harsher in 2016 than in 2012, according to an analysis by the Times/Miami Herald Tallahassee Bureau. 
The state’s full complement of delegates is 99. In 2012, Republicans were docked back to 49 for its early primary. In 2016, they would have been bumped down to 12. 
That’s in addition to the indignity of far-flung hotel rooms. In 2012, Florida delegates spent hours waiting for shuttle buses that were supposed to take them from downtown Tampa to hotel rooms in Palm Harbor, nearly 30 miles away. 
The move would also be a dramatic boost to whoever wins the Florida presidential primary in 2016. Maybe Rubio? 
From the Times/Herald report: 
""We would go from being the third-largest delegation to being the smallest,"" said Todd Reid, state director for Rubio. 
Asked about Rubio's potential bid for president in 2016, Reid said the changes had nothing to do with the senator's political future and noted that Democrats support the changes as much, if not more, than Republicans. 
The Times caught up with Rubio himself in Washington. He said the penalties changed the situation, as did the growing influence of super PACs. 
""When we changed the primary when I was in the House, it made sense because at that time these elections were still being decided in three or four early states. In the advent of super PACs, where someone will give you $1 million and you can survive for months at a time, it's changed. If these races are going to go on until April or June, then it behooves Florida to have its full comple­ment of delegates."" 
Finally, we wondered, who benefited the most from Rubio’s change of position? Rubio, or the people of Florida? After all, Florida did get a lot of attention in 2008 and 2012 with its early primary. (In 2012, the major Republican candidates came to Tampa for a nationally televised debate.) 
To help us consider that question, we turned to Steven Tauber, a political science professor at the University of South Florida. 
For Rubio the candidate, it’s unlikely that an 87-delegate penalty would be a make-or-break difference for his presidential aspirations, he said. 
For the state of Florida, though, the penalties are tough enough that it makes sense to follow the rules. And besides, going first isn’t the big advantage that it used to be. 
""When races are close, and the assumption is that the 2016 Republican nomination will be close, the states in the middle are more important,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
There is little doubt that Rubio has changed position on whether Florida should jump the line and have an early primary. Back in 2007, he pushed the change through the Florida Legislature. Just recently, he supported moving the date back. He says facts on the ground have changed: The penalties exacted by the political parties are harsher. Meanwhile, campaign cash from super PACs means candidates are hanging in longer and extending the campaign season. 
Be that as it may, the move is a major reversal of position. We’ll call it what it is: Full Flop!","[('\n100 Innovative Ideas for Florida’s Future, by Marco Rubio, 2006', 'https://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/feb/26/marco-rubio/rubio-claims-57-his-100-ideas-were-made-law-florid/'), ('\nPolitiFact Florida, Rubio claims 57 of his 100 ideas were made law by the Florida Legislature, Feb. 26, 2010', 'No link'), ('\nTampa Bay Times, Florida faces a primary problem, Oct. 7, 2007, accessed via Nexis', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/elections/rubio-urges-legislature-agrees-to-push-back-2016-presidential-primary/2119078'), (""\nTampa Bay Times/Miami Herald Tallahassee Bureau, At Rubio's urging, Florida election reform bill ends early presidential primary, May 3, 2013"", 'No link'), ('\nTampa Bay Times, Rubio says super PACs helped drive his push for moving Florida primary, May 8, 2013', 'http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/rubio-says-super-pacs-help-drive-his-push-for-moving-florida-primary/2119818'), ('\nTampa Bay Times, RNC delegates fume over bus delays; officials work on logistics, Aug. 29, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Alex Conant of Sen.

"['Marriage', 'Florida', 'Charlie Crist']","
After voting for a ban, Charlie Crist now backs gay marriage
","
Charlie Crist, Florida’s once (and future?) governor, posted a note on his Facebook page congratulating two states for legalizing gay marriage. 
""Some great news: On Tuesday, Delaware became the 11th state to allow marriage equality. And just a few days ago, Rhode Island adopted a similar measure, which followed victories last fall in Maine, Maryland and Washington. I most certainly support marriage equality in Florida and look forward to the day it happens here,"" he posted on Facebook on May 8, 2013. 
That doesn’t sound like the Crist we’ve always known. He’s a former Republican who turned independent who turned Democrat. He backed John McCain in the 2008 presidential contest but last year endorsed Barack Obama’s re-election. 
In other words, flip-flopping is in his past. 
At PolitiFact, we put politicians’ consistency on issues on our Flip-O-Meter, rating them from No Flip to Full Flop. The meter is not intended to pass judgment on their decisions to change their minds. It’s simply gaging whether they did. 
So what’s the history of Crist’s position on same-sex marriage? Crist, who is believed to be planning another run for governor in his new party, ""most certainly"" supports it now. Let’s see whether he always has. 
2006 governor’s race 
Back when Crist was a ""Ronald Reagan Republican,"" he led a field of GOP candidates vying to be governor. (He went on to win.) During that race, an effort was gaining steam to put a state constitutional amendment on the ballot defining marriage as a union between ""only one man and one woman."" 
Early in the campaign, Crist said he thought such an amendment was unnecessary because state law already forbids gay marriage. But as the primary rolled on, Crist signed the petition for the ballot initiative and sent mailers declaring his support for traditional marriage. 
By the time the measure went to voters in 2008, Crist was a popular governor whose more socially conservative election opponents were in his rear-view mirror. Crist made it clear he wouldn’t stump for the cause. 
""It's not an issue that moves me,"" he said in late 2007, when it was clear the effort had enough signatures to get on the ballot. ""I'm just a live and let live kind of guy."" 
And yet... 
On Election Day 2008, Crist supported the ban. ""I voted for it,"" he said. ""It's what I believe in."" The measure passed with 62 percent of the vote. 
2010 Senate run 
When one of Florida’s U.S. senators decided not to seek re-election, Crist, who probably would have cruised to re-election as governor, pounced on the Washington opportunity. He ended up in a bare-knuckles battle that forced him to leave the Republican Party and run as an independent. He lost to Republican Marco Rubio. 
During that campaign, he released a position paper on issues affecting gays and lesbians. There, he declared support for civil unions that ""provide the full range of legal protections"" including ""access to a loved one in the hospital, inheritance rights, the fundamental things people need to take care of their families."" He also expressed support for anti-discrimination laws that protect gay people, repeal of Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell in the military and gay adoption. He did not mention same-sex marriage in the statement.   
2014 run for ... ? 
Crist’s exuberant Facebook post, which looks forward to ""the day it happens"" in Florida, certainly isn’t unique among Democrats this year. Notably, Florida’s Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson recently pledged his support for gay marriage. 
And Crist, as a newly minted Democrat, has been under pressure from advocates for gay rights to ""come to amends with LGBT Floridians."" 
Our ruling 
We’re considering whether Crist has flip-flopped on his position on gay marriage. 
Looking back through his political career in Florida, we found that Crist’s opinion has traversed the spectrum. As a Republican gubernatorial candidate in 2006, Crist signed a petition to help get a gay marriage ban on the Florida ballot and said he supported ""traditional marriage."" 
While governor, he appeared to soften on the subject, saying he was a ""live and let live"" kind of person. But he voted for the ban nonetheless. As a Senate candidate, he stopped short of endorsing gay marriage, saying he supported civil unions that afforded the legal benefits of marriage. 
Now, out of office but potentially eyeing a comeback, Crist has made his flip-flop complete, offering full-throated support for gay marriage. 
That’s what we call a Full Flop.","[('\nCharlie Crist’s Facebook page, accessed May 9, 2013', 'https://www.facebook.com/charliecrist?ref=ts&fref=ts'), ('\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""To succeed Jeb, a race to the right,"" March 3, 2005', 'No link'), ('\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""Anti-gay marriage proposal on move,"" Aug. 20, 2005', 'http://eqfl.org/node/470'), ('\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""Crist takes ‘live and let live’ approach to marriage vote,"" Dec. 14, 2007', 'No link'), ('\nSt. Petersburg Times, ""Gay ban poised to pass barely,"" Nov. 5, 2008', 'http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/the-buzz-florida-politics/a-gay-problem-for-charlie-crist/2119216'), ('\nFlorida Department of State, Florida Marriage Protection Amendment Initiative Information, accessed May 9, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEquality Florida, Florida Governor Charlie Crist Releases Position Paper on LGBT Issues, Sept. 12, 2010', 'http://www.tampabay.com/news/courts/civil/bill-nelson-changes-position-supports-gay-marriage/2113230'), ('\nTampa Bay Times, ""A gay problem for Charlie Crist,"" May 3, 2013', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2013/may/09/charlie-crist/after-voting-ban-crist-now-backs-gay-marriage/

Bill Richardson says Hispanic support for immigration reform is almost universal
","
Former Democratic cabinet member and New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson caused a bit of a kerfuffle recently when he knocked Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, for Cruz’s skepticism about immigration legislation that’s pending in Congress. 
During a web interview with ABC News, host Benjamin Bell asked Richardson, ""Do you think he represents most Hispanics with his politics?"" 
""No,"" Richardson responded, ""He’s anti-immigration. Almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform. No, I don’t think he should be defined as a Hispanic. He's a politician from Texas, a conservative state."" 
Critics later took Richardson to task for seeming to judge whether another politician was ""Hispanic"" enough, and the former governor proceeded to clarify in a Fox News interview that while he and Cruz disagree on immigration, ""all I was saying is I don’t consider myself just a Hispanic and he shouldn’t be defined just as a Hispanic. We’re other things. That’s what I said."" 
We won’t wade into the question of what Richardson meant when he described Cruz, but we did think it was worth looking at whether the evidence supports Richardson’s claim that ""almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform."" 
We decided to take a look at the available poll data to determine whether Hispanic support for immigration reform is anywhere close to universal. 
Finding poll data that speaks to this question is actually trickier than one might imagine. A typical national poll -- even one from a major survey firm -- usually doesn’t have enough Hispanic respondents to produce reliable results. So we had to look at polls that are targeted at Hispanic voters, which are much less common. Frequently, these Hispanic-focused polls ask questions in both Spanish and English, which adds to their reliability. 
We’ll also note that Richardson used the term ""immigration reform,"" which has any number of definitions. For this analysis, we will focus on the immigration policies that would allow a path to citizenship or other benefits to illegal immigrants, since those are the highest-profile and in many cases most controversial aspects of immigration proposals currently being discussed. 
We found nine relevant questions over the past few years that polled Hispanics: 
• Pew Research Center, February 2013: ""What should be the priority for dealing with illegal immigration? Better border security and stronger enforcement of immigration laws, or creating a way for illegal immigrants to become citizens if they meet certain requirements?"" 
Among Hispanics, 49 percent said both should be equal priorities and 41 percent said creating a path to citizenship should be the priority, for a combined score of 90 percent supporting a path to citizenship. Eight percent said border security should be the priority. The poll surveyed 149 Hispanics, for a 9 percentage-point margin of error. 
• Pew Research Center, March 2013. ""Should illegal immigrants be allowed to stay in the country legally or not? If yes, should they be granted citizenship or permanent residency?"" 
Among Hispanics, 80 percent said they should be able to stay legally, of which 49 percent opted for citizenship and 26 percent favored permanent residency. Seventeen percent said they should not be allowed to stay legally. The poll surveyed 155 Hispanics, with a roughly 9 percentage-point margin of error. 
• Pew Hispanic Center, October 2012. ""Do you approve of President Obama’s program for unauthorized immigrants brought as children?"" (This policy offers relief from deportation for unauthorized immigrants younger than 30 who were brought into the country as children and who are currently enrolled in school or have obtained a high school diploma or GED.) 
Among Hispanics, 89 percent approved of the policy, compared to 9 percent who disapproved. The poll surveyed 1,765 Latinos with a 3 percentage point margin of error. 
• Pew Hispanic Center, October 2012. ""Thinking about immigrants who are living in the United States illegally, do you favor or oppose providing a way for illegal immigrants currently in the country to gain legal citizenship if they pass background checks, pay fines and have jobs?"" 
Among Hispanics, 86 percent favored the policy as stated, while 8 percent opposed it. The poll surveyed 1,375 Latinos for a 3 percentage point margin of error. 
• Public Religion Research Institute-Brookings Institution, March 2013. ""Should the immigration system allow immigrants currently living in the U.S. illegally to become citizens provided they meet certain requirements?"" 
Among Hispanic Catholics,74 percent supported the policy, as did 71 percent of Hispanic Protestants. The poll surveyed 450 Hispanics. The poll surveyed 450 Hispanics, for a margin of error of 5 percentage points. 
• Public Religion Research Institute-Brookings Institution, March 2013. ""Do you favor allowing illegal immigrants brought to the U.S. as children to gain legal resident status if they join the military or go to college?"" (This is a core part of the DREAM Act.) 
Among Hispanic Catholics, 83 percent expressed support, while 68 percent of Hispanic Protestants did. The poll surveyed 450 Hispanics, for a margin of error of 5 percentage points. 
• Latino Decisions-National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials-America’s Voice Education Fund, April 2013. ""I want to ask you some questions about your views should immigration reform be passed this year. Suppose the law also allowed you to eventually become a United States citizen. Would you become a citizen or not?"" 
Alone among the polls listed here, this is the only one to specifically pose its question to undocumented immigrants. It found that 87 percent of undocumented immigrants would apply for citizenship, a tacit indication that they approve of the policy. The poll surveyed 400 undocumented immigrants, for a margin of error of 5 percentage points. 
• Univision-Latino Decisions, November 2011. ""Do you support or oppose the DREAM Act, which would provide undocumented immigrant youth a path to citizenship if they attend college or serve in the U.S. military?"" 
Among Hispanics, 83 percent supported the policy either strongly or somewhat, compared to 11 percent who opposed it either strongly or somewhat. The poll surveyed 1,000 Latinos for a margin of error of 3 percentage points. 
• Latino Consortium-Latino Decisions, March 2013. ""Congress is considering many different ideas to include in a new immigration reform law. … Which would you support more? The plan that would provide a clear pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, so long as they meet certain requirements, or the plan that would give them probationary status until the border is declared fully secure, and then they could start to apply for citizenship?"" 
Among Hispanics, 70 percent supported a clear pathway to citizenship, while 25 percent favored waiting until the border is secure. Poll surveyed 800 Latinos, for a 3.5 percentage point margin of error. 
Our ruling 
The polls that surveyed enough Hispanic voters to be reliable showed strong and consistent majority support for a variety of policies that might be characterized as ""immigration reform."" In some cases, the level of support reached 90 percent. 
However, saying, as Richardson did, that ""almost every Hispanic in the country wants to see immigration reform,"" overlooks the 8 percent to 25 percent of Hispanics who, depending on how the question is asked, expressed reservations about or opposition to those policies. The level of dissent among Hispanics is small, but it's not as infinitesimal as Richardson’s comment suggests. We rate his claim Mostly True.","[('\nBill Richardson, web interview with ABC News, May 5, 2013', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gd0o6rPt8D4&feature=player_embedded'), ('\nWashington Post, ""Bill Richardson: Ted Cruz should not ‘be defined as a Hispanic,’"" May 6, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nBill Richardson, interview with Fox News, May 6, 2013', 'https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/05/06/bill-richardson-ted-cruz-should-not-be-defined-as-a-hispanic/'), ('\nPew Research Center for the People and the Press, ""If No Deal is Struck, Four-in-Ten Say Let the Sequester Happen,"" Feb. 21, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nPew Research Center for the People and the Press, ""Most Say Illegal Immigrants Should Be Allowed to Stay, But Citizenship Is More Divisive,"" March 28, 2013', 'http://public.video.foxnews.com/services/player/bcpid1826433252001?bckey=AQ%7E%7E,AAABqUACmYk%7E,5yKviwdJq_9DHNwhRj_-biJu8n5uEHPS&bctid=2360217869001'), ('\nPew Hispanic Center, ""Latino Voters Support Obama by 3-1 Ratio, But Are Less Certain than Others about Voting,"" Oct. 11, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nPew Hispanic Center, ""Illegal Immigration Backlash Worries, Divides Latinos,"" Oct. 28, 2010', 'http://www.people-press.org/2013/02/21/section-1-opinions-about-major-issues/'), ('\nPublic Religion Research Institute-Brookings Institution, ""Citizenship, Values, and Cultural Concerns: What Americans Want From Immigration Reform, Findings from the 2013 Religion, Values, and Immigration Reform Survey,"" March 21, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nLatino Decisions-NALEO-America’s Voice Education Fund, ""Survey of Latino Undocumented Immigrants,"" March 2013', 'http://www.people-press.org/2013/03/28/most-say-illegal-immigrants-should-be-allowed-to-stay-but-citizenship-is-more-divisive/'), ('\nUnivision-Latino Decisions, ""National Latino Electorate Poll Results,"" Nov. 2, 2011', 'No link'), ('\nLatino Consortium-Latino Decisions, poll toplines, March 18, 2013', 'http://www.pewhispanic.org/2012/10/11/latinos-and-immigration-policy/'), ('\nEmail interview with Karlyn Bowman, polling analyst for the American Enterprise Institute, May 7, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Charles Franklin, co-developer of Pollster.com and professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, May 7, 2013', 'http://www.pewhispanic.org/2010/10/28/iv-views-of-immigration-policy/'), ('\nEmail interview with Mark Hugo Lopez, associate director of the Pew Hispanic Center, May 7, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview with Matt Barreto, political scientist at the University of Washington and principal with Latino Decisions polling group, May 7, 2013', 'http://publicreligion.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/03/2013-Immigration-Report-Layout-For-Web2.pdf')]",/factchecks/2013/may/09/bill-richardson/bill-richardson-says-hispanic-support-immigration-/

New Chris Christie TV ad touts balanced budgets, job gains
","No new taxes. The best job growth in a decade. All under Chris Christie’s leadership.   New Jersey was a broken state before Christie became governor, but now that he’s here and has made tough decisions, the state is on a more positive and fiscally sound path, a new television ad claims.     ""Four balanced budgets in a row, with no new taxes for anyone. The best job growth in 12 years. Nearly 130,000 new private-sector jobs. Merit pay to reward New Jersey’s best teachers, and the most education funding ever,"" a narrator states as scenes of a gritty New Jersey and the aftermath of October’s Hurricane Sandy, play.     This fact-check looks strictly at the ad’s claims about balanced budgets, new taxes and job growth. Two of the claims are on target. We will fact-check the ad’s education-related claims Sunday.   The governor claims he balanced four budgets and he’s correct. But it’s hardly an accomplishment that distinguishes Christie from any other governor since state law requires a balanced spending plan.     No new taxes for anyone, however, is debatable.     During a 2011 town hall meeting in Evesham Township, Christie ruled out any tax increases, according to a fact sheet for the ad shared by Christie For Governor spokesman Kevin Roberts.     But other actions by the governor could be construed as raising taxes, experts have previously told PolitiFact New Jersey.     Although rates for income, sales and corporate business taxes have not gone up under Christie, Christie has cut funding to several tax credit programs that have the same effect as tax increases.     Here’s one example: New Jersey scaled back the state’s Earned Income Tax Credit -- which the state Treasury Department website said ""reduces the amount of New Jersey tax you owe and may also give you a refund, even if you have no tax liability to New Jersey"" -- in Christie’s first year in office.   Although rates didn’t increase, some homeowners and some low-income individuals received less money to offset tax bills – and that’s a type of increase, professors from the University of California Davis School of Law, and at The George Washington University, told us.   Bill Quinn, a Treasury Department spokesman, said at the time that ""the Earned Income Tax Credit in most cases really represents a subsidy payment to low income citizens,"" pointing out that more than 76 percent of earned income tax credit recipients in 2010 owed no New Jersey tax.   Next, let’s review that claim about New Jersey having the best job growth in 12 years, amounting to about 130,000 new private-sector jobs.   The claim is accurate, according to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. New Jersey saw an inrease of 66,400 total payroll jobs from December 2011 through 2012. There is no other annual timeframe, measured from December to December, that had as high an increase in the previous 12 years, said Joseph J. Seneca, an economics professor at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University.   The state also had the best year-over-year increase in private-sector jobs from December 2011 to December 2012, at 59,100, he said.

Is the idea of one casino per tribe a false one?
","
The Coquille Indian Tribe wants to turn a bowling alley in Medford into a casino with 600 video gambling machines, adding to another casino it operates in North Bend. 
Coquille Tribal Chief Ken Tanner told a reporter that the tribe has the right to build a second casino. ""The idea of one casino per tribe is a false one. Evidence of that is that the governor signed our compact which allows us a second casino,"" he said in a radio report that aired April 24, 2013, on Oregon Public Broadcasting. 
Tanner’s claim was news to PolitiFact Oregon. Is the ""one casino per tribe"" idea a false one, not grounded in reality? We always thought the policy was the norm in Oregon. 
Federal law calls for a tribe and state to negotiate a compact agreement before a casino can be sited. The compact spells out location, security and size. 
There is no federal or state law that limits tribes to one casino each. It is a policy of Gov. John Kitzhaber, who served two four-year terms from 1995 to 2003 and was elected to a third term that began in 2011. Gov. Ted Kulongoski, who served in-between, also adhered to this policy. 
Each of Oregon’s nine federally recognized tribes has a current compact with the state that identifies one casino location: The Grand Ronde has Spirit Mountain Casinoand the Siletz has Chinook Winds Casino. The Warm Springs opened Indian Head Casino in 2012, and in doing so, closed its casino at Kah-Nee-Ta Resort and Spa. 
Coquille  
We spoke with Ray Doering, spokesman for the Coquille Economic Development Corporation, which operates the Mill Casino in North Bend. (Tanner later followed up with an e-mail to PolitiFact Oregon, saying that he stood by his statement.)   
Doering made two points: One, the proposed venture is a different type of casino, one that does not need to go through the compact process. Two, he said, the tribe never agreed to Kitzhaber’s policy, even if it signed a compact in 2000 for the Mill Casino. 
Doering said it doesn’t matter what other tribes say they agreed to because the Coquille did not. 
""There was no agreement to keep it at one facility. What it says in this contract, we agreed to not seek an additional compact for a period of five years and that (provision) ended eight years ago,"" Doering said. 
Indeed, the 52-page agreement signed in 2000 specifies that the Coquille waives any right for a period of five years to even think about negotiating an agreement for another casino unless another tribe is allowed to operate more than one casino. 
Doering points to the compact language as evidence that the tribe could negotiate for a second casino after five years. Kitzhaber’s legal counsel says the language does not entitle the tribe to a second casino. The Burns Paiute, Klamath, Siletz and Umatilla tribes have similar five-year language in their compacts, said a spokesman for the governor. 
The compacts for Cow Creek, Warm Springs and Grand Ronde are more explicit, and the tribes waive any rights they may have to pursue a second casino, regardless of time frame. 
Governor, others 
The Cow Creek Band of Umpqua Tribe of Indians, which operates the Seven Feathers Casino Resort in Canyonville, is at risk of losing money to a 600-machine casino in Medford and opposes the proposed second casino. Cow Creek leaders say Kitzhaber’s one casino, one tribe policy was agreed to by Oregon’s tribes and preserves the balance of casino gambling in the state. 
""We see it as an agreement made in good faith. The governor’s office calls it a policy; we would call it an agreement,"" said Susan Ferris, spokeswoman for Cow Creek. 
There’s another aspect we need to address: Types of casinos. The governor has authority to negotiate compacts for the large-scale tribal casinos currently in Oregon, called Class III. He has no authority over Class II casinos, which the National Indian Gaming Commission defines as casinos offering bingo and ""when played in the same location as bingo - pull tabs, lotto, punch boards, tip jars, instant bingo, other games similar to bingo."" The proposed casino would fall into this category. 
The ruling: 
Tanner is correct that the idea of one casino per tribe is a malleable one. This is Kitzhaber’s policy, and one that might fail in a legal challenge. Also, a future governor could decide on no limits at all. And the governor has no authority over any proliferation of bingo-oriented casinos. 
But it’s not entirely accurate to say that the idea of one casino per tribe is ""a false one,"" or that the idea is non-existent. 
Kitzhaber, in a letter this week urging the Bureau of Indian Affairs to reject the Coquille proposal, wrote, ""My ‘one casino per tribe’ policy direction and the gaming compacts entered into between the State and the tribes provide support for the notion that, as a State, we have consistently attempted to strike a balance between tribal pursuit of economic enterprise and a check on the expansion of gambling in our State.""   
In the eyes of Coquille leaders, the policy does not apply because they did not agree to it. But a policy does exist, in the governor’s stated words and in the compacts of other tribes in Oregon. The Warm Springs closed one casino in order to open another. The Cow Creek believe it to be an agreement made by the tribes. 
The statement is Half True -- partially accurate but missing important details.","[('\nOPB, ""Coquille Tribe Wants Second Casino In Medford,"" April 24, 2013', 'http://www.opb.org/news/article/tribes-planned-medford-casino-would-end-gambling-limit/'), ('\nAP, ""Medford council hears debate over Coquille tribe\'s casino plan,"" April 26, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nGov.

UW System's reserves fair to middling, system president says
","
The late Al McGuire parlayed his 1977 national championship as Marquette University's basketball coach into a lucrative speaking and broadcasting career. Asked at one point if he had enough money, McGuire playfully boasted: ""I have so much now, I don't even count it. I weigh it."" 
Nice. 
Satisfied smiles were harder to find in April 2013 when it was reported that the University of Wisconsin System, after years of tuition hikes, had accumulated reserves of $648 million. 
Incensed state lawmakers, primarily Republicans, suggested the system was so fat with cash, it needed a belt and suspenders to keep its breeches up. 
Not so, countered UW System president Kevin Reilly. 
Defending his institution to lawmakers April 23, 2013, four days after release of the state report that revealed the $648 million, Reilly asserted that the reserve is in the ""mid- to low-range"" of what comparable public university systems have. 
In other words, it didn't weigh as much as the critics claimed. 
Let’s see if he’s right. 
The system 
The UW System describes itself as one of the largest systems of public higher education in the country, serving more than 181,000 students. It is made up of 13 four-year universities, including the flagship UW-Madison, 13 two-year campuses and the statewide UW Extension. 
The system’s total reserve revealed by the state report was $1 billion as of June 30, 2012 (a figure that has since been projected to grow by $150 million by the end of June 2013). 
Of the $1 billion, $648 million is unrestricted. That’s the reserve figure that has received the most focus. The state report said the $648 million -- up 13 percent from one year earlier -- represents about one-fourth of the UW System’s unrestricted budget. 
In the wake of the lawmakers’ furor over the funds, the Chronicle of Higher Education cited data from Moody’s Investors Service saying the median amount of cash that university systems keep on hand is in that range -- 23 percent of their operation budgets. 
But when we asked the UW System for evidence to back Reilly’s claim, spokesman David Giroux provided data from a different calculation, saying it allowed for a better comparison of state university systems. 
Reilly’s evidence 
That data compared the UW System’s ""primary reserve ratio"" to the ratios at five state university systems that are among the institutions the UW System considers to be its peers. 
The UW System said its 25 percent primary reserve ratio, as of June 30, 2012, equals $1.13 billion in expendable net assets divided by $4.5 billion in total expenses. 
That put Wisconsin in the mid- to low range in the UW System’s comparison of primary reserve ratios -- although Giroux acknowledged that the list of five institutions cited by the UW was not an exhaustive comparison, but rather utilized financial reports that were available online. 
Here’s how they ranked: 
1. Texas: 95 percent 
2. Illinois: 34 percent 
3. Minnesota: 29 percent 
4. Wisconsin: 25 percent 
5. California: 21 percent 
6. Georgia: -5 percent 
We asked three experts about those figures: 
Eastern Michigan University accounting professor Howard Bunsis, whose specialties include governmental accounting 
Susan Menditto, director of accounting policy at the National Association of College and University Business Officers, which represents business and financial officers of more than 2,500 colleges, universities and university systems 
Certified public accountant Larry Goldstein, president of Campus Strategies LLC, a Virginia management consulting firm that serves higher education agencies and institutions, including the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee 
Some of the experts calculated different primary reserve ratios for some of the institutions; Bunsis, for example, calculated Georgia’s ratio to be 18 percent, not -5 percent. 
Nevertheless, the experts’ 1-to-6 rankings were the same as the rankings put out by the UW System.   
That would appear to back Reilly’s claim that the UW System is in the middle to low range among its peers in terms of cash reserves. 
But let’s take a closer look at the measure the UW System used. And let’s do a broader comparison. 
Primary reserve ratio 
All three experts agreed the primary reserve ratio is an important and commonly used ratio for determining a university system’s financial strength. 
They said Wisconsin’s ratio of 25 percent indicates that, if the UW System’s income were cut off, it would have enough reserves or ""expendable assets"" to meet its expenses for three months -- three months being 25 percent of one year. 
(What is an appropriate level of cash reserves, of course, is in the eye of the beholder and doesn’t relate to the Reilly claim we’re fact checking. But we’ll note that Bunsis said a primary reserve ratio of 15 to 20 percent is considered prudent, 40 percent ""very solid"" and anything over 50 percent high. Menditto cited a consultant’s report that said 40 percent is advisable.) 
""Peer institutions"" 
The question of which university systems the UW System should be compared to is trickier. 
Unfortunately, the experts told us, there is no large compilation of university systems’ primary reserve ratios. And there are other issues: the experts didn’t necessarily agree that the Illinois, Minnesota, California and Texas state systems, because of their makeup, were truly peers of Wisconsin; and some systems that could be comparable, such as Ohio and North Carolina, produce consolidated financial statements at the campus level, but not the system level. 
We were able, however, to find primary reserve ratios for three other state systems that can be compared to Wisconsin’s. 
Goldstein, the Virginia consultant, said Maryland, though a smaller state university system, is a peer of Wisconsin; and indeed the UW System considers it a peer, Giroux told us. Goldstein said Maryland’s primary reserve ratio is 37 percent. 
The UW System also has long considered the State University of New York system as being a peer and Goldstein agreed. Goldstein told us that, like Georgia, SUNY has a negative primary reserve ratio -16 percent. 
And while the UW System doesn’t consider the Nebraska state system as among its peers, Nebraska system considers Wisconsin as one of its peers. Goldstein said Nebraska’s primary reserve ratio is 67 percent. 
So, here’s how that list looks: 
1. Nebraska: 67 percent 
2. Maryland: 37 percent 
3. Wisconsin: 25 percent 
4. SUNY: -16 percent 
Our rating 
Reilly said UW System's reserves are in the ""mid- to low-range"" of comparable university systems, as though that fact has been clearly established. 
Using a key measure, Wisconsin’s level of reserves is below that of some of its peers. But there is debate about whether some of the state systems the UW System considers to be peers are in fact peers. And figures simply aren’t available for other peer systems. 
With the evidence available, we find Reilly’s statement partially accurate but missing important details -- our definition of Half True.","[('\nWisconsin Eye, video of University of Wisconsin System President Kevin Reilly (quote at 35:45), April 23, 2013', 'http://www.wiseye.org/videoplayer/vp.html?sid=9933'), ('\nEmail interview, University of Wisconsin System executive director of communications and external relations David Giroux, April 26, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nPolitiFact Wisconsin, ""The UW System’s ‘slush fund’ -- $1 billion, $207 million, or what?,"" April 23, 2013', 'https://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/article/2013/apr/23/examining-university-wisconsin-system-slush-fund-i/'), ('\nUniversity of Wisconsin System, peer university systems identified in ""Competitive University Workforce Commission,"" June 2010', 'No link'), ('\nEmail interview, Eastern Michigan University accounting professor Howard Bunsis, April 30, 2013', 'http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lfb/UW_Task_Force/Documents/2012_03_07_CUWC%20Final%20report.pdf'), ('\nInterview and email interview, National Association of College and University Business Officers director of accounting policy Susan Menditto, April 30 and May 1, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nInterview, Wisconsin Rep.

Jim Marston says Texas leads the nation in fatal industrial accidents
","
Five days after the fertilizer plant explosion that killed 14 in West, talk turned to safety regulation at the Texas Tribune’s morning interview series. 
Jim Marston, founding director of the Texas office of the Environmental Defense Fund, opined from the Tribune stage on April 22, 2013, that state regulation should have prevented the deaths. In Texas, ""we lead the nation in fatal industrial accidents,"" he said. 
To support his statement, he referred us to Elena Craft, a toxicologist with the fund, who told us by phone that the information came from a Sept. 20, 2012, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report. 
That report, though, was on 2011 fatal occupational injuries -- including intentional acts such as murder and suicides and spanning, bureau economist Steve Pegula told us by phone, ""every occupation in the U.S."" 
Pegula told us the bureau does not use the term ""industrial accidents"" and has no definition for it. Others we talked with for this story used phrases such as ""an accident that arises out of the course of employment"" or ""workplace event that results in multiple fatalities."" 
""Industrial,"" we found, could be defined as narrowly as manufacturing or as broadly as any business at all. 
The bureau tally, Pegula said, includes deadly events or exposure on or off an employer’s premises during or related to the employee’s job or work status. For example, the deaths of farmers, police or nurses are included if they take place on the job or related to their work. Not included are illnesses or events such as heart attacks or strokes, because onsets can be delayed and it can be hard to prove the connection to employment, Pegula said. 
Via email, Marston told us that although his claim had been based on the total deaths in the bureau’s count, ""I do agree with you that not all fatal occupation injuries listed in the BLS data can be attributed to poor environmental compliance."" Texas, he said, had the most deaths tabulated by the bureau in four areas he described as ""fatal industrial accident categories"": fires and explosions; falls, trips and slips; exposure to harmful substances or environments; and contact with objects and equipment. 
Representatives of groups we spoke with -- the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), the National Safety Council and the Texas-based Workers Defense Project -- told us the bureau’s Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries, which generated the figures Marston relied on, was the most comprehensive source of data on occupational injuries and deaths. 
Pegula said the Sept. 12, 2012, report gave preliminary 2011 data, ""which is going to differ slightly"" from the final numbers, ""but it’s a good guiding post."" 
Of the six types of event or exposure the bureau listed, Texas led in five -- the four Marston tabbed as ""industrial accident categories"" plus the transportation category. California led in deaths caused by violence and other injuries by persons or animals. 
The report showed Texas had 18 of the nation’s 143 work fatalities attributed to fires and explosions; 67 of the total 666 from falls, slips and trips; 43 of the 401 caused by exposure to harmful substances or environments; and 66 of 708 deaths resulting from contact with objects and other equipment. 
California had the second-most in each of Marston’s four categories: 9, 60, 36 and 50 deaths, respectively. Third in fires/explosions was Tennessee with 10; third in falls and slips was New York with 39; third in harmful exposure was Florida with 27; and New York was third in object/equipment contact deaths at 34. 
We looked at preliminary data for 2003 through 2010 and found Texas led those categories about 88 percent of the time. 
Texas’ totals are high, Pegula said, ""because it’s a very large state."" Texas, California, Florida and New York have some of the largest labor forces in the U.S. 
Seeking a way to account for that, we took each state’s 2011 raw numbers of deaths in the four categories Marston tabbed, added them together, then divided by the average number of workers employed in the state in 2011 per the federal bureau. 
Texas ranked 18th, with a rate of 1.7 such deaths per 100,000 workers. Observing that the five states with the ""worst"" rates all employed fewer than 1 million people in 2011, we checked to see how Texas fared among states employing more than 1 million. The answer: 10th place. 
""Worst"" among all 50 states were Montana (3.4 deaths per 100,000 workers), North Dakota (3.3), West Virginia (3), Alaska (3) and New Mexico (2.8). ""Worst"" among states with more than 1 million employed were Arkansas (2.6), Louisiana (2.3), Kansas (2.3), Missouri (2.1) and Kentucky (2). 
Pegula at the federal bureau cautioned against comparing states, especially with such small amounts of data as the fatalities in specific categories. Not only the number of workers but also the industries represented vary widely from state to state, he said. 
The big difference in population sizes, Marston said, causes variability in comparing the rates -- one reason he chose to use raw counts rather than per-capita rates. 
Marston said he stands behind his statement ""as true and accurate using the best available data."" 
Our ruling 
Marston said that in Texas, ""we lead the nation in fatal industrial accidents."" 
Among the states, Texas ranked No. 1 in 2011 in the number of workplace deaths in four federal categories Marston tabbed as ""industrial accident"" deaths. Yet these results drew on raw counts of deaths, unadjusted for variations in state workforces. Our adjustment for each state’s relative workforce suggests that Texas, per worker, ranked 18th among the states in 2011. 
We rate his statement as Half True.","[('\nTexas Tribune event, ""A Conversation about the Environment,"" April 22, 2013', 'https://www.texastribune.org/events/2013/apr/22/a-conversation-about-the-environment/'), ('\nTelephone and email interviews, excerpted, with Jim Marston, Texas chapter, Environmental Defense Fund April 22-May 3, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nTelephone interview with Elena Craft, toxicologist, Texas chapter, Environmental Defense Fund, April 22, 2013', 'https://docs.google.com/document/d/1i0l9KyPP0x7Iv5VMgDi_WUF2huew3pfB9Yhv7U555Q0/edit?usp=sharing'), ('\nU.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics report, ""National Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries in 2011 (Preliminary Results),"", Sept. 20, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nTelephone interviews with Steve Pegula, economist, Bureau of Labor Statistics, April 26-May 3, 2013', 'http://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/cfoi.pdf')]",/factchecks/2013/may/08/jim-marston/jim-marston-says-texas-leads-nation-fatal-industri/
"['Georgia', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'Zell Miller']","
Education spending under Gov. Sanders touted
","
Georgia sometimes gets a bad rap for the amount of money the state invests in education and spends on students.  
Just last month, for example, a study by a national education organization said Georgia fell six spots to 25th out of 40 states in spending on its pre-kindergarten program over two school years since 2010 due to budget cuts.  
But the education funding battles of recent budget years were different 50 years ago. In a recent Atlanta Journal-Constitution article about the 1963 Georgia Legislature, former Gov. Zell Miller recalled the strides made in education by then-Gov. Carl Sanders.  
Miller lauded Sanders for putting 56 percent of the state budget into education -- a figure, Miller said, that has not been achieved since. 
That percentage seemed rather large, even for the largest portion of state government. PolitiFact Georgia wondered if Miller, who later became a U.S. senator, was correct. 
Miller, a North Georgia Democrat and longtime politician, called the 1963 legislative session ""the birth of modern Georgia."" That was the year that the courts ordered that Senate districts be reapportioned to reflect populations, which meant more power for Georgia’s cities and minorities. That 1963 session saw the first African-American senator (Leroy R. Johnson), and the installment of Sanders as governor. 
Sanders, also a Democrat, became governor at age 37, the youngest in the nation at the time, after running on a platform of a new, modern Georgia. He’s known as Georgia’s first New South governor, and the first modern governor elected by popular vote. He served one term, from 1963 to 1967; ran unsuccessfully for the post in 1970 against Jimmy Carter, then left politics to practice law.  
In the book ""Carl Sanders: Spokesman of the New South,"" author and historian James F. Cook repeats a similar statistic about Sanders’ education investment: ""... he (Sanders) made education his first priority and directed nearly sixty cents of every tax dollar into education.""  
The book passage says that under Sanders’ leadership, 10,000 new teachers were added to Georgia’s schools, and more schools and classrooms were built than under any previous administration. The Governor’s Honors program and the junior college network were started, four junior colleges were elevated to four-year status and a new dental school was established. 
As for funding, $176.5 million was appropriated for University System construction, and average faculty salaries increased 32.5 percent, moving Georgia from 10th to fourth place among Southern states.  
""I knew that the more people we could educate in Georgia, the better off the state would be in every capacity, politic wise, business wise, otherwise,"" Sanders said in a 2007 Georgia Public Broadcasting interview. 
The kicker, according to Cook’s book: Despite Sanders’ extensive education spending, the former governor left $140 million in the treasury -- the largest amount ever left to a succeeding governor up to that time. 
In addition to the historical accounts of Sanders’ spending, we also checked with the state Education Department and state budget office for more help. 
Financial reports of all school systems kept by the Georgia Department of Education were available from 1996 to 2012. Those records showed that one year, 1998, the education portion of the state’s budget exceeded Sanders’ 56 percent, by 2 percentage points. For the available reporting years, the data showed four years -- 1996, 1997, 1999 and 2001 -- where the education allocation tied Sanders’ 56 percent figure.  
It must be noted that some of the budgets in the Education Department data included some state funding for Georgia schools that was not available during Sanders’ tenure, such as lottery funds. 
Data compiled and provided by the Governor’s Office of Planning and Budget included information from Sanders’ first year in office, 1963, through fiscal year 2014. The data substantiated Miller’s claim about Sanders’ education allocation reaching 56 percent of the budget, but also showed that the allocation reached 58 percent for schools during his third year in office, 1965.  
The budget office data also showed the education portion of the state budget either equaled or exceeded the 56 percent allocation from 1964 through 1970, and from 2009 to 2011. Agency officials noted that the data included lottery and tobacco settlement funds. Those dollars weren’t available to Sanders. Also of note, the amounts from 1963 to 1974 -- which covered Sanders’ term -- included money for capital projects, like buying land and building facilities. 
How was Sanders able to accomplish his education goals? 
""I had the budget power to put together a package of bills to accomplish what I wanted to accomplish because the (House and Senate) didn’t have their own budget officers,"" Sanders, 87, told PolitiFact Georgia in an interview from his law office. ""I didn’t realize I would be the last governor with that power."" 
So does Miller’s claim get fully funded? 
He said former Gov. Carl Sanders allocated 56 percent of the state budget to education, a level that has not since been achieved. Historical accounts and actual state education and budget data confirmed Sanders’ allocation levels. The data also showed a few years since Sanders when the levels have reached that amount, but those years included funding, such as lottery and tobacco settlement dollars, that were not available to Sanders. 
Overall, it is important to note that over the past 50 years, methods for funding education in the state, the available revenue streams and the definition of what constitutes education have changed numerous times.

Group says that under Perry's plan, Texas cut funding for schools 25 percent
","
Fix Austin Schools, a group advocating voter approval of four bond propositions benefiting the Austin school district, slammed Gov. Rick Perry’s ""education plan"" in a leaflet fielded by local voters in early May 2013.

Under the word ""cut"" in capital letters, one side of the leaflet says: ""Under Rick Perry, Texas has CUT funding for public schools by 25%,"" a conclusion attributed to PolitiFact.

Lynda Rife, a consultant to the group, told us the claim echoed our January 2013 review of Perry’s statement to reporters at the time that Texas public school funding grew at three times the rate of enrollment from 2002 to 2012.

In raw terms, there was a basis for Perry’s claim. However, after adjusting for inflation and the effect of an annual tax swap put in motion by lawmakers and Perry in 2006, we concluded that Texas schools in 2012 were fielding 25 percent less in state aid than what they reaped in 2002. Perry’s claim drew a rating of False.

At the time, we looked at enrollment changes and at both overall school spending, counting dollars from state, federal and local sources, and state education aid alone.

Enrollment

Enrollment increased about 20 percent from 2001-02 to 2011-12, from more than 4.1 million to nearly 5 million students, according to a December 2012 report by the Texas Education Agency. By email, agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us 2012-13 enrollment was expected to exceed 5 million, a figure subsequently confirmed, Ratcliffe told us recently by email.

Overall spending

Overall school expenditures totaled $27.9 billion in 2002 and $44.2 billion in 2012, according to a chart from the Legislative Budget Board, which tracks fiscal issues for lawmakers.

That makes for a difference of 58 percent, though that’s also before adjusting for inflation, which the board’s staff did by converting figures to 2004 dollars using an inflation adjuster devised by the federal government, the Implicit Price Deflator for State and Local Government.

 In 2004 dollars, Texas public school spending in 2002 totaled $30.1 billion. In 2012, the total was $33.3 billion--11 percent greater than in 2002.

By this measure, then, it looks like school enrollment went up faster than spending. Then again, we learned, these figures were not behind Perry’s statement.

State spending alone

Perry’s then-spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, told us by email that Perry was referring to the difference in state education spending alone ""as those are the funds the state has control over.""

The budget board’s chart shows $10.9 billion in state spending on the schools in 2002 and $18.9 billion in 2012, for a 73 percent difference, or a little more than Perry’s declared 70 percent.

Adjusting for inflation, though, reduces the increase to 20 percent, which was still outpacing enrollment growth. In 2004 dollars, such spending was $14.2 billion in 2012, compared with $11.8 billion in 2002.

Another crucial factor

Analyst Eva DeLuna Castro of the liberal Center for Public Policy Priorities and school lobbyist Lynn Moak, a former Texas Education Agency official, each pointed out another wrinkle, suggesting that any consideration of state education spending should take into account changes in law approved in 2006 resulting in the state picking up about $7 billion more in annual costs in return for school districts cutting local maintenance and operation property tax rates.

Castro said by email: ""The property tax cut was $14.2 billion a biennium, or $7.1 billion every year. That means the state had to put in that amount of money a year to offset local property taxes falling by the same amount.""

The shift in funding sources did not, in itself, step up aid received by the schools, Castro said.

Moak said by phone: ""This was simply a source-of-funds transfer.""

To adjust for the annual cost shift, we subtracted $7.1 billion from the state spending in 2012, suggesting a $0.9 billion difference from the 2002 spending. However, adjusting for inflation makes the 2012 state spending equal $8.2 billion in 2002 dollars--25 percent less than the $10.9 billion spent in 2002, which also would mean that spending trailed enrollment growth.

For this article, finally, we weighed the message that the reduced spending was Perry’s education plan. Perry was governor through all the spending decisions, but the reality is that Republican majorities of the 150-member House and 31-member Senate were needed to pass the decisions into law. Perry was key, but he didn't dictate actions. No governor can.

Our ruling

The pro-bonds’ group said that under Perry’s education plan, Texas has cut funding for public schools by 25 percent.

State education spending in 2012 was 25 percent lower than it was in 2002, adjusting for inflation and the real effects of the 2006 law giving the state more responsibility for education revenues.

Yet Perry didn’t cause the reduction by himself; lawmakers acted, too. This clarification is missing from the group’s statement, which we rate as Mostly True.","[('\nTruth-O-Meter article, ""Rick Perry says Texas education spending increased a phenomenal 70 percent as enrollment escalated 23 percent,"" PolitiFact Texas, Jan. 16, 2013', 'https://www.politifact.com/texas/statements/2013/jan/16/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-texas-education-increased-phenomen/')]",/factchecks/2013/may/07/fix-austin-schools/group-says-under-perrys-plan-texas-cut-funding-sch/

State Rep. Ron Maag says employees earn more money in ‘right-to-work’ states
","
Only hours after two Statehouse Republicans unveiled legislation to make Ohio a ""right-to-work"" state, GOP leadership shot it downas a distraction lacking support. 
""We have an ambitious agenda focused on job creation and economic recovery,"" Senate President Keith Faber said in a statement, ""and right-to-work legislation is not on that list."" 
But the legislation's co-sponsors, Rep. Kristina Roegner of Hudson and Rep. Ron Maag of Lebanon, depicted their proposals as a matter of ""workplace freedom"" that would attract jobs. 
And contrary to a frequent argument of opponents, Maag asserted that workersin so-called right-to-work states make more money. 
PolitiFact Ohio wondered how that claim is backed up. 
Maag's staff pointed us to the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, a ""free market"" think tank based in Midland, Mich., that strongly supports right-to-work laws. 
Its ""Michigan Worker Freedom"" website says: ""Workers in right-to-work states make more. When adjusting for cost of living, workers in right-to-work states have 4.1 percent higher per-capita personal incomes than workers in non-right-to-work states."" 
The source for that is a posting by James M. Hohman, assistant director of fiscal policy at the Mackinac Center. He writes that he calculated the adjusted per-capita personal income using a state-by-state cost of living index, and converted personal income figures for all 50 states to the value of Michigan dollars. 
""Right-to-work states have 4.1 percent higher per-capita personal incomes than non-right-to-work states,"" Hohman says. 
That conclusion is not widely held, however, even though the evidence is at best mixed on the effect that right-to-work laws have on paychecks and local economies. 
Noting that it is difficult to isolate the impact of a single policy, two economists for the generally pro-union Economic Policy Institute conducted an analysisof right-to-work laws using a regression model that controlled for more than 40 factors in addition to the cost of living in different states. 
Their analysis found that wages in right-to-work states are 3.2 percent lower than those elsewhere -- for everyone, not just union members. They concluded that the average full-time, full-year worker in a right-to-work state makes about $1,500 less per year than a similar worker elsewhere. 
In states with a right-to-work law, the Wall Street Journal reportedlast December, ""wages tend to be lower, but job growth stronger, than states that don't have the law. But gauging how much of this divergence in paychecks and employment is a result of the laws is difficult to do."" 
The Journal said that employees in right-to-work states earned 9.8 percent less than workers in states without such laws, according to an analysis of Labor Department data that did not include health-care and other benefits -- ""but proving cause and effect on wages is difficult, since many factors influence what workers are paid in a given locale, such as whether the mix of businesses are concentrated in higher-paying industries."" 
The meticulously nonpartisan Congressional Research Service issued a studylast December examining right-to-work laws. 
Using data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, it found that wages in what it called ""union security states"" were 16.6 percent higher than in right-to-work states. 
Among CRS's conclusions: ""Wages are lower in right-to-work states than union security states"" -- and that ""historical research has suggested that right-to-work laws have little influence on these differences."" 
Where does that leave Maag’s statement? 
Some economists who support right-to-work laws say wages are comparable or higher in right-to-work states when cost-of-living differences are taken into account. And Maag correctly cited that research. 
But federal data from a nonpartisan government research arm shows that employees in right-to-work states earn less. So does another analysis that tries to hold other things equal. 
None of it shows a definitive relationship between right-to-work laws and economic outcomes, even though (as the Wall Street Journal noted) the laws were first adopted in the South as part of a larger drive to lure factory jobs from the heavily unionized and better paying North. 
Maag’s statement, like others we have seen surrounding the highly charged right-to-work issue, suggests a cause-and-effect relationship that is not supported by any evidence. 
We rate the statement as Mostly False.","[('\nStatehouse News Bureau, Ohio Public Radio, ""GOP leader signals \'right-to-work\' bills may go nowhere in Ohio,"" May 2, 2013', 'http://www.wksu.org/news/story/35442'), ('\nToledo Blade, ""Ohio Senate tables proposed right-to-work bills,"" May 2, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nInterview with Marisa Myers, for Rep.

Newt Gingrich says rise in unemployment statistic shows weakness of labor market
","On NBC’s Meet the Press, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, R-Ga., pointed to a somewhat obscure labor statistic as evidence that the economy continues to fare poorly more than five years after the onset of the last recession. ""I think it's very dangerous to suggest that this economy's healthy,"" Ginrgich said. He went on to argue that the implementation of President Barack Obama’s health care law could push some companies to turn full-time workers into part-timers in order to avoid providing health coverage. ""The pain level it's going to cause, is going to be enormous,"" Gingrich said of the health care law. ""The number of people who are going to have their jobs reduced to 29 hours, because that way their employer doesn't have to pay for their insurance, is going to be staggering. And if you look at the U-6 number, which was unemployed, under-employed, and dropped out, it actually went up last month to 13.5 percent."" The U-6 number, for the nonwonks in our audience, is a federal statistic that tries to capture a broader picture of labor-market weakness than the more familiar unemployment rate. As Gingrich indicated, the statistic takes into account not just people who are unemployed but also people working part-time who would rather have full-time work, as well as people who have stopped looking for work but would begin to look again if labor-market conditions improved. Because it includes these additional factors, the U-6 rate tends to track the official unemployment rate, but is usually a few points higher. The experts we interviewed didn’t object to Gingrich’s concern about the health of the economy. In general, labor market measures have improved significantly from their weakest point in 2010, but the key measurements are ""still historically very high and not dropping precipitously,"" particularly this long after the beginning of the last recession, said George Washington University economist Tara Sinclair. However, we will focus on whether the rise in the U-6 measurement Gingrich cited supports his point about the health of the economy. As it turns out, Gingrich was actually low when he said the current U-6 level is 13.5 percent. The seasonally adjusted figure -- which is the preferred number when comparing the data across months, as Gingrich is doing -- was 13.9 percent in April 2013. Still, the more important factor given his comment is to look at how the number has been moving. And while Gingrich was right that the number went up in April 2013, there’s less to that fact than meets the eye. The statistic rose from 13.8 percent in March to 13.9 percent in April. The experts we interviewed saw two big asterisks in this rise. • A change of one-tenth of a percentage point is not statistically significant. We checked with Bureau of Labor Statistics, and a spokesman told us that the U-6 measure needs to move three-tenths of a percentage point in a month for the change to qualify as statistically significant. The actual change from March to April was one-third of that, meaning that the change is essentially statistical noise. (Obama supporters note: The 0.1 percentage point fall in the unemployment rate from March to April was also statistically insignificant, so you shouldn’t make too much of that statistic either.) • With the exception of April’s number, the U-6 has generally been falling, not rising. In fact, while there were occasional jogs upward, the statistic has been on a pretty steady decline since it peaked at 17.1 in April 2010. The current level of 13.9 percent is now about where it was in December 2008, a month before Obama was inaugurated. Indeed, since January 2013, the statistic has fallen by half a percentage point -- an amount that is statistically significant, unlike April’s small rise. Gingrich’s portrayal of a small increase like April’s as evidence of a worrisome trend amounts to cherry picking. ""Kvetching about a 0.1 percentage-point change seems a bit silly in the context of other changes in employment, unemployment, and underemployment published in April’s BLS report,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. ""The number of payroll jobs increased by 165,000 in April and has increased 635,000 since January. "" Burtless agreed that ""conditions are improving way too slowly for anyone to think it’s time to break out the champagne,"" but he added that ""it’s ridiculous to suggest April’s employment report contains evidence of a weakening in the trend toward a better job market."" Our ruling Gingrich said that if you count the unemployed, underemployed, and those who’ve stopped looking for work, the unemployment rate ""actually went up last month to 13.5 percent."" Gingrich is correct that the measurement in question did rise. However, that rise was not statistically significant, and it has been more than outweighed by a consistent decline in the numbers over the past three years.

Marco Rubio says Obama shows ‘reluctance’ to enforce immigration law
","
Republican Sen. Marco Rubio is taking a precarious lead on immigration reform within his party, where the vocal conservative wing is wary of any hint of amnesty for people living in the U.S. illegally. 
Rubio is framing his case, in part, by reminding Republicans that they don’t want President Barack Obama leading the way on this issue. 
""We are dealing with 11 million people, but we are also dealing with the future of immigration in this country, and we are dealing with an administration that, quite frankly, has shown a reluctance to enforce the immigration law,"" Rubio told Fox News’ Greta Van Susteren on April 30, 2013. ""Look, if you want to know the single impediment to get things done ... people don't believe the Obama administration or the federal government will enforce the law."" 
As Rubio continues barnstorming for immigration reform, the claim that Obama has gone soft on enforcement has become part of his script. 
Is it true? 
We reached out to Rubio’s spokesman, Alex Conant, the White House and other experts to evaluate Obama's record on enforcing immigration law. 
First, we'll examine points from Obama's critics, evidence that they say shows he is reluctant to enforce immigration law. Then we'll look at the other side, at evidence that some say shows Obama has vigorously enforced immigration law. 
Where enforcement has decreased 
Prosecutorial discretion on deportations. Conant pointed us to the criticism that the Obama administration is choosing not to deport millions of known illegal immigrants. 
In 2011, the administration announced a policy of making deportation of criminals (think violent offenders, gang members and drug traffickers) who are in the U.S. illegally a top priority. Those with no criminal record or threat to public safety became a low priority and would likely be allowed to remain in the U.S. 
These positions are enshrined in the ""Morton memos,"" directives from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director John Morton issued in June 2011. 
""ICE … has limited resources to remove those illegally in the United States. ICE must prioritize the use of its enforcement personnel, detention space and removal assets to ensure that the aliens it removes represent, as much as reasonably possible, the agency's enforcement priorities, namely the promotion of national security, border security, public safety, and the integrity of the immigration system,"" Morton wrote. 
That meant that family members, students and other longtime resident immigrants would not be targeted. 
Deferred action on immigrants brought as children. Conant also cited Obama’s actions on immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children, commonly called ""Dreamers."" 
In June 2012, Obama announced that his administration would no longer deport young undocumented immigrants if they met certain criteria, including having entered the United States as children, having a clean criminal record and attending school. 
Prosecutorial discretion and deferred action no doubt mean that certain segments of immigrants are not being eyed for deportation. But David Martin, an international law professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, argued that doesn’t add up to a reluctance to enforce the law. He said it’s ""choosing different things to enforce."" 
""There’s been an effort since very early to be more serious and more systematic about the priorities,"" Martin said. ""In my view that’s a perfectly appropriately way to operate a law enforcement agency. I see it as more sensible enforcement."" 
Position on ""border triggers."" Many Republicans, including Rubio, want immigration reform to include a ""trigger"" that says the border will be secure before immigrants can begin the path toward legal status or citizenship. The Obama administration opposes such a trigger. 
""I think that once people really look at the whole system and how it works, relying on one thing as a so-called trigger is not the way to go,"" Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said in March 2013. ""There needs to be certainty in the bill so that people know when they can legalize and then when the pathway to citizenship, earned citizenship, would open up."" 
A border trigger, however, is a mechanism of proposed law -- not something currently in place that the Obama administration is declining to enforce. 
A lawsuit against Arizona. Is Obama not only shying from enforcement, but also going after states that are getting tough? 
Conant noted the Justice Department’s 2010 lawsuit against the state of Arizona over its controversial immigration law that grants local police greater authority to check the legal status of people they stop. The law was meant to ""discourage and deter"" illegal immigrants from staying in the state. 
Federal officials said Arizona’s law would flood them with cases of illegal immigrants who pose no danger. 
But the federal government’s lawsuit is a constitutional issue more than an enforcement one. 
""They went after Arizona on a constitutional principle that the federal government is in charge of immigration and it’s the federal government that should be making immigration laws, not Arizona,"" said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration attorney and adjunct professor at Cornell Law School. 
No more 287(g) program. Jessica Zuckerman, a homeland security analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the Obama administration has ""all but abolished"" a program that allows state and local law enforcement to essentially be deputized as immigration agents and be allowed to arrest people for immigration issues. It’s known as 287(g). 
""That program’s been undercut basically to the point that it doesn’t exist anymore,"" Zuckerman said. 
Indeed, this 2012 announcement from Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, says exactly that. 
""ICE has also decided not to renew any of its agreements with state and local law enforcement agencies that operate task forces under the 287(g) program. ICE has concluded that other enforcement programs... are a more efficient use of resources for focusing on priority cases,"" the announcement said. 
Fewer workplace raids. Zuckerman also said far fewer random searches are occurring at workplaces where illegal immigrants are suspected to be employed. 
Large-scale workplace arrests of illegal workers were hallmarks of the George W. Bush administration's approach, and in 2011 arrests from worksite raids had dropped by 70 percent since Bush left office. 
That too reflected Obama’s contrasting priorities, as ICE officials turned their attention to employers. If immigration inspectors found evidence that immigrant workers’ identity documents might be false, managers had to dismiss the workers or risk prosecution. 
But Zuckerman argues that document audits don’t equal enforcement. 
""It needs to be part of other enforcement measures that have decreased,"" she said. ""None of them alone is a silver bullet."" 
Where enforcement has increased 
Experts also told us that Obama has ramped up enforcement on some avenues of immigration law. 
""Secure Communities."" While backing away from the 287(g) program, the Obama administration put renewed emphasis on the Secure Communities program which is meant to identify ""dangerous criminal aliens"" for deportation. Local law enforcement agencies send criminal suspects’ fingerprints to be checked in national crime databases. If an arrestee turns out to be an illegal immigrant with a serious rap sheet, the person can be taken into federal custody. 
Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration policy analyst with the libertarian Cato Institute, said the program was used in about 3 percent of U.S. jurisdictions when Obama took office and is in about 97 percent today. 
Secure Communities, he said, ""is the most effective immigration enforcement tool to date as it conscripts local law enforcement into enforcing federal immigration laws. 
Zuckerman, however, noted that ""it only focuses on criminal aliens and not the broader issue."" 
Deportations are up. It has been widely reported that overall deportations of illegal immigrants have increased during Obama’s term. 
ICE deported 409,949 immigrants in the 2012 fiscal year, up from 396,096 immigrants in FY 2011 and more than 392,000 immigrants in FY 2010. Those figures all show a steady increase over every year of the Bush administration. This chart from the pro-immigrant group America’s Voice shows year-to-year figures. 
Those numbers, however, are disputed by critics who note that deportations at the border are up, while other types -- such as those from the defunct 287(g) program -- have dropped off. 
""They’re doing a different kind of enforcement that results in higher numbers, but there are definitely not more people being removed from the interior of the country,"" Jessica Vaughan, director of policy studies at the Center for Immigration Studies which favors lower immigration levels, told the Washington Times recently. 
At PolitiFact, we have also noted that personnel and other resources to stop illegal crossings at the U.S.-Mexico border have increased dramatically in recent years. The number of border patrol officers more than doubled from about 10,000 to about 21,000 between 2004 and 2012. 
Employer prosecutions. As we noted above, while fewer workplace raids are happening, the Obama administration is focusing more on prosecutions against employers and doing more audits of workers’ documentation paperwork to ensure immigration compliance. 
In 2011, the New York Times reported that ICE started 2,746 workplace investigations, more than double the number in 2008. Fines totaling a record $43 million were levied on companies in immigration cases. 
Our ruling 
Rubio said the Obama administration ""has shown a reluctance to enforce the immigration law."" 
His spokesman pointed out some concrete changes in how Obama has approached immigration, namely a program to allow people brought here illegally as children to seek deferred action on deportation and an emphasis on deporting criminals while leaving many illegal residents who are otherwise law abiders alone. But while Rubio calls that reluctance, others see it as prioritizing. Obama has put new emphasis on some approaches, such as adding border agents, while minimizing others, such as the 287(g) program. 
Whether those priorities represent sound policy is a matter of opinion.

Martina Navratilova says you can be fired for being gay in 29 states
","
One of the biggest news stories of last week came from the world of sports, with NBA player Jason Collins becoming the first active male athlete playing for a major U.S. team sport to come out as gay. Several Sunday public-affairs shows tried to put Collins’ declaration into historical context. 
CBS’ Face the Nation invited retired tennis great Martina Navratilova, among others, to discuss its significance. Navratilova came out as gay more than three decades ago. 
""I think when President (Barack) Obama came in favor of … gay marriage, that really changed the tide. But we have to remember that this has been a long time coming,"" she said. ""We still don't have equal rights. I have been getting (questions) on Twitter, ‘Why does this matter? I don't care.’ Which is kind of code for, ‘I really don't want to know.’ But it does matter because in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay but if your employer thinks you are gay. ... We don't have equal rights."" 
We wondered whether Navratilova was correct that ""in 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay."" 
According to the Human Rights Campaign, a gay-rights group, 21 states plus the District of Columbia explicitly prohibit employment discrimination based on sexual orientation. The remaining 29 do not. (This map shows the legal situation by state.) 
We should note that the 29 states in question are defined by the absence of a law prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, rather than the presence of a law allowing such discrimination. This means employees in these states who believe they are discriminated against would not have grounds to win a lawsuit alleging discrimination. The group said that it’s possible for an employer to discriminate based on the perception, rather than the fact, that someone is gay. 
But while Navratilova gets the number right, our discussions with legal experts produced a few exceptions to the rule: 
• Government employees in those states have protections. Government workers are covered by the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. A public employee can establish a violation if they can show they were subjected to adverse treatment when compared with other similarly situated employees, and that the treatment was motivated by an intention to discriminate on the basis of improper considerations, according to Lambda Legal Defense, a legal organization focused on challenging discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender individuals. Courts have backed the idea that sexual orientation is one of the categories that would permit such a lawsuit. 
In addition, nine other states -- beyond the 21 that currently ban discrimination based on sexual orientation -- have an executive order, administrative order or personnel regulation that prohibits such discrimination against public employees, according to the Human Rights Campaign. 
• Localities may have an anti-discrimination law even if their state does not. To give just one example, Pennsylvania has no statewide law, but many of its cities do, from Philadelphia and Pittsburgh all the way down to Jenkintown and Susquehanna Township, according to the Pennsylvania Diversity Network. According to the group, 12 of the 15 most populous cities in the Keystone State have anti-discrimination laws that cover sexual orientation, meaning a sizable percentage of employees in the state are covered even without a state law. 
• Individual employers may have policies that bar discrimination based on sexual orientation, even if their state or city does not. ""Some employers, through union agreements, company handbooks or other contracts, may have explicitly or implicitly promised to refrain from certain kinds of discrimination, and these provisions, depending on the particulars, might protect some employees against irrational discrimination of this kind,"" said Vik Amar, a law professor at the University of California at Davis. 
• Title VII of the Civil Rights Act provides protection for employees who are subjected to gender-based stereotyping. This is relevant because Navratilova said you could get fired ""if your employer thinks you are gay"" -- not just if you are actually gay. While the Civil Rights Act currently protects only sex discrimination and not discrimination based on sexual orientation, gender-based stereotyping can include elements that overlap significantly with an employer ""think(ing) you are gay."" 
Hayley Gorenberg, deputy legal director of Lambda Legal, cited the 1989 Supreme Court case Price Waterhouse vs. Hopkins. In that case, a woman sued the accounting firm where she worked because she was not offered a promotion after a senior manager told her she should ""walk more femininely, talk more femininely, dress more femininely, wear make-up, have her hair styled, and wear jewelry."" The plaintiff convinced the court that sex stereotyping constitutes sex discrimination, Gorenberg said. This precedent could protect a straight person who appeared to an employer to be ""gay"" and suffered discrimination as a result. 
Gorenberg said that despite these exceptions, Navratilova has a point. She said that calls to her group’s national legal help line include a ""very high percentage"" of workplace discrimination complaints. ""Without specific national protection, people are fired based on their sexual orientation far more easily,"" she said. 
Our ruling 
Navratilova said, ""In 29 states in this country you can still get fired for not just being gay, but if your employer thinks you are gay."" If you frame this statement in the context of blanket protections by states, she’s correct. Still, even in those 29 states, many gay and lesbian employees do have protections, either because they work for the government, because they live in a city that bars such discrimination, or because they work for a company that has pledged not to discriminate based on sexual orientation. On balance, we rate Navratilova’s claim Half True.","[('\nMartina Navratilova, interview on CBS’ Face the Nation, May 5, 2013', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57582939/face-the-nation-transcripts-may-5-2013-benghazi-and-gay-athletes-issa-rogers-ruppersberger/?pageNum=6'), ('\nHuman Rights Campaign, ""Statewide Employment Laws and Policies,"" accessed May 6, 2013', 'No link'), ('\nPennsylvania Diversity Network, summary of local anti-discrimination laws in Pennsylvania, accessed May 6, 2013', 'https://www.hrc.org/files/assets/resources/Employment_Laws_and_Policies.pdf'), ('\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964', 'No link'), ('\nU.S. Supreme Court, Price Waterhouse v.

Chamber leader errs on tort reform claim
","
One of the state’s leading business boosters recently offered some advice he believes will help improve Georgia’s economy. 
The Peach State needs additional measures to ensure businesses get a fair shake in Georgia courtrooms. 
""Other states have passed even better tort reforms,"" Chris Clark, the president of the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, told a group of business leaders at Berry College in Rome. 
Clark offered some statistics to back up his claim. Six years ago, Georgia was first in the nation from the standpoint of a friendly legal climate to do business, said Clark, according to the Rome News-Tribune. Today, Clark said, Georgia ranks 24th. 
A PolitiFact Georgia reader asked us to fact-check the claim, contending that Georgia was not No. 1 six years ago. 
The U.S. Chamber of Commerce compiles research and has released a report on state lawsuit climate in each year during the past decade, except 2009. The rankings are based on a number of factors, including treatment of tort and contract litigation, treatment of class-action lawsuits, punitive damages, judge impartiality and fairness. 
Last year, Georgia was ranked 24th, as Clark said. However, Georgia was ranked 31st in 2007. In 2006, Georgia was ranked 27th. Georgia ranked no higher than 24th in any year since 2002. 
The Georgia Legislature last changed its laws on tort reform in 2005, the chamber noted. 
When contacted by PolitiFact Georgia, Joselyn Baker, a senior vice president for the Georgia Chamber, said that Clark erred in his remarks. 
""Chris did misspeak earlier,"" Baker told us. ""As you can imagine, he gives a lot of speeches that contain a lot of data … and sometimes can make a mistake."" 
She added: ""That said – the point he was making does not change. Georgia made some significant progress with civil justice reform in 2005 that made a positive impact on our business climate. The Georgia Chamber believes that the legal environment is an important factor in location and expansion decisions and that we must continue to look for ways to ensure that businesses are treated fairly in the courts and that our state compares favorably with our economic competition."" 
Our tipster, Chris Kelleher, spokesman for the Georgia Trial Lawyers Association, said he contacted us because some chamber leaders have made similar claims in the past. 
Kelleher said in an email that Georgia is among ""the top 10 most pro-business states in the country."" Kelleher complained ""the chamber continues to perpetuate its myth that our legal climate makes Georgia unattractive to businesses.""  
To sum up, Clark said that in just six years, Georgia had fallen from first in the nation from a legal climate standpoint to do business to 24th. Georgia was most recently ranked 24th, as Clark said. But it has been nowhere near first, based on the study he used for his claim. 
Clark is right about the most recent ranking, but he was way off about Georgia previously being first.

Van de Putte says about 250 Texans killed in action since 9/11
","
Leticia Van de Putte says that thankfully, few Texans stand to benefit from her proposed tax break for surviving spouses of Texans who die in action.

The San Antonio Democrat, who chairs the Senate Veteran Affairs and Military Installations Committee, told colleagues on the Senate floor May 1, 2013: ""According to Department of Defense data, there would only be about 250 killed in action, who were Texans, since 9/11.""

Michael Brick, an Associated Press reporter based in Austin, brought her claim to our attention via Twitter, wondering if that tally was low.

It was, according to a table of figures emailed to us by Van de Putte spokesman Lee Nichols. The table indicates 588 Texans were killed in action from Oct. 1, 2011, to Jan. 24, 2013. It was prepared by the Defense Manpower Data Center, which is the Department of Defense’s ""human resource information source.""

Some 310 of the Texans were married when they died, the table indicates, while 253 were not married; 24 were divorced; and one had an unknown marital status.

By email, Nichols noted that Van de Putte generally focused in her remarks on Texas members of the armed services killed in action with surviving spouses in the state who might benefit from her proposed constitutional amendment, which cleared the Senate and awaits House consideration. Under the proposal, which also would require voter approval to take effect, spouses who have not remarried could be exempt from paying property taxes on their homesteads.

Shortly after declaring the 250 figure, Nichols stressed, Van de Putte clarified by saying: ""So we’re talking probably about 250 folks who would even qualify for this, and that’s since 9/11.""

Nichols said Van de Putte gave the incorrect figure due to staff error. By telephone, Bill Wilson, chief of staff for the Senate committee, told us that as Van de Putte spoke, he gave her the 250 figure by drawing from the wrong column on the table. His intent, he said, was to let her know that 310 of the Texans killed in action since 9/11 were married, which is of relevance to the fiscal impact of her proposal.

Finally, Defense Department spokeswoman Leslie Hull-Ryde guided us to up-to-date online counts of Americans killed in action, enabling us to confirm that as of May 2, 2013, 588 Texans had been killed in action since Oct. 1, 2011. Those Texans comprised 11 percent of the 5,258 Americans killed in action since 9/11, according to the government figures.

Precisely, the government counts indicate, 411 Texans were killed in Operation Iraqi Freedom (which ran through August 2010); 170 in Operation Enduring Freedom (occurring in Afghanistan and other countries); and seven in Operation New Dawn (in Iraq and nearby countries since Sept. 1, 2010)--with all but 11 of the dead being men. According to the information, the deaths occurred from Jan. 4, 2002, through Dec. 24, 2012. We calculated the average age of the victims as 26. (See our breakout, including individual names and other details, here.)

Brick, the AP reporter, responded to Nichols’ email on this topic by tweeting a May 2, 2013, update, followed by a confessional tweet: ""Related: This reporter once spent weeks gathering string on a story,"" as in detail, ""then spelled Sen. VDP's name wrong, so nobody's perfect.""

Our ruling

Van de Putte said about 250 Texans have been killed in action since 9/11.

That’s off by more than half; 588 Texans perished in action from January 2002 through the most recent Texan's death on Dec. 24, 2012, according to the federal government.

The senator likely drew her number from the wrong column on a table. Regardless, what she said rates as False.","[('\nEmail (excerpted), Lee Nichols, communications director, Sen.

Bloggers say Pentagon may court-martial Christian soldiers
","
No more military chaplains? Soldiers court-martialed for their Christian faith? 
PolitiFact readers wanted to know if headlines across websites such as Breitbart.com and MrConservative.com last week were true. 
""Pentagon May Court Martial Soldiers Who Share Christian Faith,"" said Breitbart.com, claiming that ""the Pentagon has released a statement confirming that soldiers could be prosecuted."" 
It could ""effectively abolish the position of chaplain in the military,"" the post said. 
""Pentagon Confirms They May Court Martial Soldiers Who Hold Christian Faith,"" said MrConservative.com, explaining that ""the Pentagon has released an official statement affirming that it will court martial 'proselytization.’"" 
So, did the Pentagon confirm it might ""court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith""? 
Welcome to the latest battle for soldiers’ hearts and minds. 
Pentagon meeting 
The recent hubbub has roots in the early 2000s, when a man named Mikey Weinstein watched his sons follow in his footsteps at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs. 
The Jewish students both faced Christian proselytizing, the family says, and in some cases, anti-Semitic slurs. 
An Air Force task force investigated accusations that the academy created a discriminatory climate, after a 2004 survey showed cadets complained that evangelical Christians had pressured Jews and other Christians. It found a need for policy guidance for commanders and supervisors regarding religious expression, not just at the academy, but across the Air Force. 
In 2005, Weinstein — a former Air Force attorney who worked in President Ronald Reagan's administration — unsuccessfully sued the Air Force for failing to prevent proselytizing. In 2006, he turned his attention full-time to his nonprofit Military Religious Freedom Foundation, saying he was fighting off ""far-right militant radical evangelical religious fundamentalists."" 
(He also writes about ""fundamentalist Christian monsters"" who unite around ""horrific hatred and blinding bigotry,"" which doesn’t exactly endear him to groups he targets, such as the Family Research Council.) 
Fast-forward to a Washington Post blog in late April. Sally Quinn, who writes about religion for the Washington Post's On Faith blog, spoke with Weinstein and others on their way to meet with ""several generals and a military chaplain."" 
Weinstein had asked for months for the April 23 sit-down, which included his board members Larry Wilkerson, a former chief of staff to Colin Powell, and Joe Wilson, a former ambassador. The three planned to exhort the military to punish proselytizing. 
They pointed Quinn to examples such as a chaplain telling troops — including Afghan soldiers — to ""get right with Jesus,"" Marine officers changing the name of their attack squadron to the ""Crusaders"" (Weinstein’s group got them to change it back) and a military contractor putting references to the New Testament on gun sights (again, Weinstein fought to have them removed). 
""It’s a workplace violation,"" Wilson said. ""This is a national security threat,"" Weinstein said. 
Weinstein also got an officer to remove an atheist bumper sticker from his car because it bothered an evangelical Christian. 
But, the men argued, the military itself needed to do more to protect troops who feel their religious freedom is undermined. 
Quinn quoted Wilson: ""You need half a dozen court-martials real quick."" 
Quinn’s post, published Friday, April 26, caught the attention of Fox News Radio commentator Todd Starnes. 
Monday, April 29, he asked the Pentagon: Is there a plan to court-martial chaplains who proselytize? 
Here’s what the Defense Department spokesman Nate Christensen told him: 
""The Department of Defense places a high value on the rights of members of the Military Services to observe the tenets of their respective religions and respects (and supports by its policy) the rights of others to their own religious beliefs, including the right to hold no beliefs. The Department does not endorse any one religion or religious organization, and provides free access of religion for all members of the military services. 
""Court martials and non-judicial punishment are decided on case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome in specific cases. 
""However, religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense."" 
Starnes wrote: 
The Pentagon confirmed to Fox News that Christian evangelism is against regulations. 
""Religious proselytization is not permitted within the Department of Defense, LCDR Nate Christensen said in a written statement. He declined to say if any chaplains or service members had been prosecuted for such an offense. 
""Court martials and non-judicial punishments are decided on a case-by-case basis and it would be inappropriate to speculate on the outcome in specific cases,"" he said. 
The Internet took over from there. 
Weinstein had been ""hired by the Pentagon"" to ""help shape policy on … religious tolerance,"" said Investor’s Business Daily. (Not true.) President Barack Obama’s Defense Department was ""promising to bring criminal charges against any military personnel who express or share their faith,"" said a PA Pundits blogger. (Also not true.) 
And an anonymous blogger at MrConservative.com, citing Breitbart.com, declared, ""Pentagon Confirms They May Court Martial Soldiers Who Hold Christian Faith."" 
PolitiFact reached out to Nate Christensen at the Defense Department, who said his statement ""was grossly taken out of context."" 
On May 2, he clarified: 
""Service members can share their faith (evangelize), but must not force unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others of any faith or no faith to one's beliefs (proselytization). 
""If a service member harasses another member on the basis of race, color, sex, religion, national origin, age, or disability, then the commander takes action based on the gravity of the occurrence. Likewise, when religious harassment complaints are reported, commanders take action based on the gravity of the occurrence on a case by case basis. 
""... We work to ensure that all service members are free to exercise their Constitutional right to practice their religion in a manner that is respectful of other individuals' rights to follow their own belief systems; and in ways that are conducive to good order and discipline; and that do not detract from accomplishing the military mission."" 
Weinstein, he said, wasn’t part of any Defense Department advisory group or committee, nor was he a consultant on religious issues. 
‘There’s a line there’ 
The military has grappled for years with how to balance the rights of people exercising different religious beliefs, or no beliefs. 
Weinstein’s group had urged the Pentagon to enforce a recent Air Force policy on ""government neutrality regarding religion."" 
He wants to see courts-martial under the Uniform Military Code of Justice’s Article 92, ""Failure to Obey Order or Regulation,"" for those who don’t follow orders not to proselytize. 
Rules in place since last year say that Air Force leaders ""must avoid the actual or apparent use of their position to promote their personal religious beliefs to their subordinates or to extend preferential treatment for any religion."" Meanwhile, ""all airmen are able to choose to practice their particular religion, or subscribe to no religious belief at all. You should confidently practice your own beliefs while respecting others whose viewpoints differ from your own."" 
Rules for military chaplains already reflect this tightrope act. They’re affiliated with outside religious organizations, but must support troops of all faiths. 
""They're very careful about how they offer advice,"" said Lori Bogle, an associate history professor at the U.S. Naval Academy who writes about religion and the military. ""They are more like counselors. And if a person expresses a religious interest, they might go there."" 
That’s been the general policy as long as she knows — even back to the 1940s. But in times of ""stress,"" the military has briefly embraced evangelism, such as during the early Cold War, when ""character guidance"" programs and seminars took on an overtly Christian cast in response to an atheist enemy. But that stopped by the mid 1960s, she said. 
So, it’s not necessarily new or surprising the Pentagon would say proselytizing isn’t permitted. 
But groups such as the Family Research Council argue the policy outlined by the Defense Department spokesman last week is ""incoherent,"" asking how the military will distinguish between ""evangelizing"" and ""proselytizing."" It has launched a petition to urge the defense secretary from censoring ""the full solace of the gospel."" Meanwhile, a Coast Guard rear admiral, William Lee, spoke last week of his discomfort with current rules — he wants to be able to hand Bibles to suicidal servicemen. 
Ken Klukowski, director of the Center for Religious Liberty at the Family Research Council, says millions of Christians, including ""evangelicals, devout Catholics and observant Mormons,"" believe they are required by the New Testament to share their faith with others. 
""This is to be done respectfully and peacefully, at appropriate times and in an appropriate manner, but it must be done when such opportunities present themselves,"" he wrote. ""To say that sharing the gospel is a crime under military law … is to say that tens of millions of Americans are not allowed to serve in our military."" 
So, to some, to ""hold Christian faith"" is synonymous with promoting that faith to co-workers and subordinates. Under that interpretation, they could theoretically face court-martial if others found their attempts intrusive or harassing. 
But so far, Weinstein’s urging hasn’t resulted in such a court-martial. 
Our ruling 
Recent headlines and articles offered versions of the claim that the ""Pentagon confirms they may court-martial soldiers who hold Christian faith."" 
Instead, a Defense Department spokesman had explained that proselytizing — ""unwanted, intrusive attempts to convert others"" — wasn’t permitted and that punishment for breaking military rules is decided ""case by case."" 
Conservative religious groups argue this means ""sharing the gospel"" would become a crime. But no policy we saw suggests that the Pentagon would court-martial soldiers ""who hold Christian faith."" Quite the opposite — much of the language from the Defense Department reinforces the right of military members to practice their religion, as long as it’s in a way that respects others’ belief systems. Chaplains already follow such rules.

Democratic Party chair Allison Tant attacks Gov. Rick Scott on teacher pay raises
","
Florida Democratic Party chairwoman Allison Tant attacked Gov. Rick Scott as a feckless chief executive who let the Florida Legislature steamroll his session priorities. 
""He boasted that his No. 1 priority for the 2013 session was a $2,500 across-the-board raise for classroom teachers,"" Tant wrote in an April 30 column for Florida Voices. ""Seven weeks later his abject failure to defend his top issue has allowed Republican legislators to cut that raise by 60 percent with a multitude of strings attached."" 
We detailed the Legislature’s compromise with Scott on teacher pay raises in this fact-check. In this case, we were intrigued by Tant’s claim that legislators cut Scott’s requested pay raise by 60 percent. (Tant’s column ran a few days before the Legislature lifted some of the more controversial strings on the raises, including the requirement that they be paid no sooner than June 2014.) 
Before the session, Scott asked for a pot of $480 million from which to dole out a $2,500 raise to every teacher. The Legislature set aside the amount he wanted, on top of adding $1 billion to education spending. But lawmakers did not exactly follow his request. The raises will not go just to teachers. Principals, vice principals, guidance counselors, social workers, psychologists and librarians are also eligible for raises. 
Scott said every teacher will get a raise. While a raise is likely for most, it is not guaranteed. School districts in negotiations with unions will ultimately decide who gets raises and how much. Lawmakers outlined a merit-pay system but gave districts the choice to implement their own merit plans. 
Adding thousands of noninstructional personnel into the pool for raises is another point of consideration, as superintendents may have to shuffle the amount of raises for teachers or the number of people who get them to make everyone fit. 
Bottom line: The specifics are TBD, to be determined. 
We asked the Democrats to support the 60 percent figure. Did Tant crunch the numbers and find that teachers will get raises of just $1,000, or 60 percent less than what Scott wanted? 
The Democrats: The line was a mistake. 
Tant’s column conflated money for teacher pay raises with money that was set aside for raises for state workers. ""It was an error,"" said party spokesman Max Steele. 
State and university workers will receive a $1,000 or $1,400 raise depending on income (some may earn an extra $600 for performance) for the first time in seven years starting in October. Law enforcement officers will get even higher raises. 
What the Democrats did is divide the $200 million pot for state and university workers by the $480 million Scott asked for. Using that (flawed) math, Scott got about 40 percent of his request -- or, viewed another way, a 60 percent cut of what he asked for. 
Our ruling 
Tant said Scott only got 60 percent of the teacher pay raise he wanted. 
The final budget compromise adds thousands of noninstructors into the pay raise mix, which could affect the number of teachers who get raises or at least how much those raises are. Still, we don’t know what that will mean on a statewide level because teacher pay is worked out by local districts and their unions. 
Still, this isn’t even what Tant was trying to analyze. She just used a mismatched number. 
We give the Democrats props for coming clean with their mistake. 
But we rate Tant’s statement False.","[('\nFlorida Voices column, ""Gov.
