"['National', 'Taxes', 'Mike Huckabee']","
It all depends what you consider average
","Arguing for his Fair Tax plan — which calls for replacing all income tax with sales tax — Mike Huckabee trotted out a familiar arrow in the quiver of IRS bashers.
 
""When you include the built-in tax, the embedded tax in the products we buy, that corporations build in, the average American is paying 33 percent in his or her taxes,"" Huckabee said at the Jan. 24, 2008, Republican debates in Boca Raton. ""The average American is working through the month of May just to pay off the government.""
 
In citing the figure, Huckabee stepped squarely into the middle of an annual debate about the burden of taxation on average Americans.
 
An organization called the Tax Foundation releases a report every year on the projected ""Tax Freedom Day,"" the purported day at which an American pays off federal, local and state taxes.
 
Tax Freedom Day is calculated by dividing the official government tally of all taxes collected in each year by the official government tally of all income earned in each year.
 
Last year, that day was April 30 (two days later than in 2006, and five days later than 2000).
 
According to the Tax Foundation, that means Americans worked for four months, from January 1 to April 30, before they earned enough money to pay their 2007 tax obligations.
 
Every year, as reliably as the Tax Foundation puts out its Tax Freedom Day press release, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities issues a competing press release that calls the Tax Foundation's numbers highly misleading.
 
It's the word ""average"" that irks the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The United States has a progressive tax system, which means people who earn more pay a higher tax rate. Essentially, the wealthy shoulder a larger part of the tax burden.
 
So while the Tax Foundation reports that Americans paid an average of 18.6 percent of their income in federal taxes in 2004, the Center would like you to consider an average taxpayer, someone in the middle fifth of the income distribution. In 2004, that segment of people paid an average of only 13.9 percent of their income in taxes.
 
So, the Center would argue, Huckabee's claim that the ""average American"" works until May to pay off his or her taxes is an exaggeration. The ""typical"" American, they say, would pay off taxes much sooner.
 
It's overstated every year, the Center says.
 
Both sides are right here. The Tax Foundation provides an accurate overall average. And the Center for Budget and Policy Priorities accurately says that figure overstates the impact on an average American.
 
Bottom line, it's mostly a debate over the term average. Had he said ""Americans on average are paying ...,"" Huckabee would have been on more solid ground than ""the average American is paying..."" You follow?
 
We can only give him a Half True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Mike Huckabee']","
His recollections are way off
","At a debate in Boca Raton on Jan. 24, 2008, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee suggested that he was more in touch with how the economy was hurting working people than the other GOP candidates.
 
He said he was the only candidate at a prior debate — the one on Oct. 9, 2007 — to point out that middle- and lower-income Americans were feeling economic pain.
 
""A few months ago, when we were all in Dearborn, Mich., your network was the sponsor, with CNBC and MSNBC, and every one of us were asked, 'How's the economy doing?' "" Huckabee said during the debate in Boca Raton. ""Every one of my colleagues said, 'It's doing great.' And they gave all the numbers. ... The truth is I was the only guy on that stage who said, 'It may be doing great if you're at the top. It's different if you're on the bottom.' ""
 
We find Huckabee's recollections are way off the mark.
 
He is correct that he indicated some sympathy for working people during the Oct. 9 debate. He plugged his proposal for a national sales tax to help the less fortunate regain their footing.
 
""The people who handle the bags and make the beds at our hotels and serve the food, many of them are having to work two jobs, and that's barely paying the rent. And you know what else? They don't think that they can afford for their kids to go to college; they're pretty sure they're not going to be able to afford health insurance,"" he said.
 
But he is wrong about the comments of his rivals.
 
Huckabee might have been the biggest pessimist that night, but Ron Paul, John McCain, Mitt Romney and Fred Thompson each noted that Michigan residents were suffering as a result of their state's battered economy.
 
Paul suggested it was because the nation was living beyond its means while McCain stated the United States was losing industrial jobs and not taking care of those who are left behind.
 
Others qualified their statements, depicting Michigan as something of an anomaly in an otherwise strong economy. Romney said his birth state was ""undergoing a one-state recession."" And Thompson said while pockets of the economy were having difficulty, he had no reason to believe the country was heading for a recession.
 
While Huckabee gets the award for tough-talking realist, he was hardly alone in acknowledging hard times. For that reason, we judge his statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Military', 'Rudy Giuliani']","
The peace dividend began with a Bush
","At a Republican debate in Boca Raton on Jan. 24, 2008, Rudy Giuliani repeated his claim that Bill Clinton is to blame for shrinking the nation's military.
 
""I think we should increase the size of our military substantially to overcome the damage that Bill Clinton did with the peace dividend,"" he said, adding that ""a lot of the cause of (the smaller military force) was Bill Clinton's peace dividend, in which he cut the military 25 and 30 percent.""
 
We've covered this topic in two previous items, one for Giuliani and one for a similiar claim made earlier by Mitt Romney. But because this misleading claim is new to many voters who are just tuning into the campaign, we'll reiterate what we've said before.
 
Romney made his claim in April 2007, saying that, ""Following the end of the Cold War, President Clinton began to dismantle our military. He reduced our forces by 500,000. He retired almost 80 ships. Our spending on national defense dropped from over 6 percent of GDP to 3.8 percent today.""
 
The two Republicans are correct that military forces were reduced significantly under Clinton. The active-duty military totaled 1.8-million at the start of his presidency in 1993 and declined to 1.4-million in 2000. They are also correct that the naval fleet shrank dramatically. The Navy had 454 ships in 1993, but as vessels were retired and not replaced, the fleet was down to 341 by 2000.
 
But they are selectively choosing numbers that make it appear that the military cuts were Clinton's alone. In fact, the cuts were prompted by the end of the Cold War during the presidency of President George H.W. Bush, a Republican.
 
During Bush's presidency, he and Congress agreed to a sharp drop in military personnel. Active-duty military declined from 2.2-million to 1.8-million. Total defense forces also shrank, from 3.3-million to 2.9-million.
 
The Republicans are trying to portray Clinton and the Democrats as weak on defense and to make the peace dividend look like a partisan effort. But contrary to the Republicans' claims, the post-Cold War shrinkage of the U.S. military was very much a bipartisan effort. It began under a Republican president and a Democratic Congress and continued under a Democratic president and a Republican Congress.
 
And so we find, as we did before, that this claim is Half True.

"['National', 'Elections', 'John McCain']","
When first means second
","Pressed on his credentials with GOP voters, John McCain said he won them over in two early primaries.
But he didn't.
 
Exit polls from the Jan. 19, 2008, primary show he narrowly lost to Mike Huckabee among self-identified Republicans in South Carolina, 32 percent to 31 percent.
 
And in New Hampshire, exit polls show Mitt Romney beat McCain 35 percent to 34 percent. However, it should be noted that a few news agencies, including MSNBC, showed McCain narrowly winning among Republicans in their results.
 
The topic is important to McCain because he has often struggled to win over die-hard Republicans. Exit polls show moderate and independent voters powered both of his victories. But when the schedule moves to states like Florida, where primaries are closed to independents, his need for Republican support becomes critical.
 
The exit polls show that McCain didn't lose among Republicans in either state. When you factor in a margin of error, both are statistical ties. But what McCain said was that he ""won the majority"" of Republicans in those states, and we don't find any evidence that that's true. We rule McCain's statement False.

Related magazine, not church, gave award
","An attack e-mail says the church Barack Obama attends, Trinity United Church of Christ in Chicago, gave a lifetime award to Louis Farrakhan. Did it?
 
It may be a small distinction, but the award Farrakhan received came from a magazine connected to the church, not the church itself.
 

Trumpet Newsmagazine

was founded by the church's senior pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., as a church newsletter. Now it's a nationally distributed lifestyle magazine aimed at socially conscious African-Americans. The magazine gave Farrakhan its Lifetime Achievement ""Dr. Jeremiah A. Wright, Jr. Trumpeter"" Award for those who work to ""save the lives of Africans on the continent and in the Diaspora.""
 
The magazine interviewed Farrakhan and quoted Wright in the introduction. Here is the entirety of Wright's remarks on Farrakhan:
 
""When Minister Farrakhan speaks, Black America listens,"" Wright said. ""Everybody may not agree with him, but they listen…His depth on analysis when it comes to the racial ills of this nation is astounding and eye opening. He brings a perspective that is helpful and honest.
 
""Minister Farrakhan will be remembered as one of the 20th and 21st century giants of the African- American religious experience,"" Wright said. ""His integrity and honesty have secured him a place in history as one of the nation's most powerful critics. His love for Africa and African-American people has made him an unforgettable force, a catalyst for change and a religious leader who is sincere about his faith and his purpose.""
 
It's worth noting that Wright appears to be applauding Farrakhan for his message of black empowerment, a philosophy Wright espouses as well. But the two men have different religions: Farrakhan is a Muslim and Wright is a Christian.
 
Obama said he did not agree with the award; for more on that, see a related statement

here

.
 
The magazine award became a campaign issue when

Washington Post

columnist Richard Cohen wrote about the award. To most Americans, Cohen wrote, Farrakhan is racist with a history of making anti-Semitic remarks.
 
Though the church didn't give the award, the magazine was founded by the church's senior pastor and is closely related. For that reason, we find the statement Mostly True.

We checked out the award claim and found it to be Mostly True. A magazine closely related to the church gave Farrakhan an award for lifetime achievement. For more on this, see the statement

But Barack Obama definitely did not remain silent about it. The award received widespread attention after

Washington Post

columnist Richard Cohen wrote about it on Jan. 15, 2008.
 
Later that day, the campaign released a statement in which Obama himself said:
 
""I decry racism and anti-Semitism in every form and strongly condemn the anti-Semitic statements made by Minister Farrakhan. I assume that

made its own decision to honor Farrakhan based on his efforts to rehabilitate ex-offenders, but it is not a decision with which I agree.""
 
Cohen said in his column that he had asked the campaign about the award and received a response from a spokesperson saying Obama did not agree with the award. The blog ""Talking Points Memo"" said it too asked Obama about Farrakhan and received the statement from Obama rejecting the award. After the statement was released, it was reported in other news outlets as well. For these reasons, we find the e-mail's claims about Obama's response to the award to be False.
 

UPDATE:

Magic wands don't exist
","Mike Huckabee makes the Fair Tax sound lovely. But he's glossing over objections raised by a host of critics who say that the Fair Tax is unfeasible and unworkable. The Fair Tax would be a sales tax that would replace all income taxes. Legislation to create it, which Huckabee supports, is introduced annually in Congress; the latest version can be found  here  . It's true that if the Fair Tax were implemented, people would get all of their paychecks (unless their employers decided to cut wages and keep the tax savings for themselves). Getting all your taxes back certainly sounds like a nice release from pain. But there are other potentially painful implications down the road that Huckabee sidesteps. Proponents of the Fair Tax support a 23 percent tax rate that assumes most people would pay the taxes they owe. Economists say that when sales taxes reach that level, the incentive for people to cheat rises. People will try to buy things off the books, and underground economies will develop. To compensate for tax evasion, the tax would have to be raised even higher, which would lead to more evasion. Abolishing the Internal Revenue Service would exacerbate the problem of compliance, said economist Dean Baker, co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington, D.C. ""At the end of this story, when you add in some state sales taxes, we could be close to 50 percent."" he said. ""Almost all the economists who have looked at proposals for relying exclusively on a sales tax have concluded that it is unworkable because the tax rate would have to be very high."" That sounds kind of ouchy to us. The transition process could also cause economic disruptions as people across the country stock up on goods before the sales tax takes effect. ""The economy would experience a surge in demand for goods as the switchover date approached and then demand would collapse,"" wrote David Cay Johnston in his book on tax evasion and enforcement,  Perfectly Legal  . A change-over would also negatively impact people who've saved, especially senior citizens. Retirees, who already have paid taxes on their income, will be taxed again on purchases they make from savings they already paid taxes on. (For a longer discussion of the Fair Tax, read our article on it  here  .) Much of the Fair Tax debate depends on what will happen if the country switches from an income-based system to a consumption-based system, a major overhaul of U.S. tax policy that could have significant unintended consequences. To be clear, we're not ruling on what will happen if the Fair Tax is implemented. Rather, we're pointing out that Huckabee's statement blithely glosses over a number of highly credible objections. It's tempting to give him a pass on his statement as just more overheated campaign rhetoric. But it seems clear to us that such a massive overhaul of the U.S. tax system would not be an end to pain and unfairness ""like a magic wand.""

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'Hillary Clinton']","
A fragment of truth, distorted
","In one of the most heated exchanges of the Democratic debates, Hillary Clinton on Monday night fired off this pointed attack on Barack Obama:
 
""I was fighting against those (Republican) ideas when you were practicing law and representing your contributor, Rezko, in his slum landlord business in inner city Chicago.""
 
Asked later to respond, Obama said, ""Here's what happened: I was an associate at a law firm that represented a church group that had partnered with this individual to do a project and I did about five hours worth of work on this joint project.""
 
The man in question here is Antoin ""Tony"" Rezko, a Chicago real estate developer and fast food magnate now under federal indictment. He's also a longtime friend of Obama who over the years did a good amount of fundraising for him.
 
In April 2007, the

Chicago Sun-Times

reported that Obama did some legal work between 1995 and 1998 on a series of troubled low-income housing deals involving Rezmar Corp., owned by Rezko.
 
Reporter Tim Novak reported that Obama was an associate attorney with the small Chicago law firm, Davis Miner Barnhill & Galland, that helped Rezmar and not-for-profit community groups secure more than $43-million in government funding to rehab 15 apartment buildings for the poor. Four ended up in foreclosure.
 
In all, Novak reported, Rezmar rehabbed 30 buildings, a third of which were in the Illinois Senate district Obama represented between 1997 and 2004. Many of the buildings fell into squalid disrepair and financial straits while Obama was state senator, prompting the city to repeatedly sue over problems, including no heat.
 
Obama's campaign staff told the

Sun-Times

that Obama worked on some of the deals, but that his Rezmar-related work amounted to just five hours.
 
""The senator, relatively inexperienced in this kind of work, was assigned to tasks appropriate for a junior lawyer,'' according to an e-mail from Obama spokesman Robert Gibbs. ""These tasks would have included reviewing documents, collecting corporate organizational documents, and drafting corporate resolutions.''
 
In fact, Gibbs wrote, ""Senator Obama does not remember having conversations with Tony (Rezko) about properties that he owned or any specific issues related to those properties.''
 
Obama told the

Sun-Times

that he often got complaints as a state senator about housing problems but, ""As far as I can tell, we were never contacted by (Rezko) tenants.""
 
It was the latest in a string of embarrassing stories that linked Obama to Rezko, who was indicted in the fall of 2006 on unrelated federal charges that accuse him of fraud, attempted extortion and money laundering. Prosecutors say Rezko's scheme was to get campaign money and payoffs from investment companies seeking to do business with two Illinois state boards. His trial could begin as early as February 2008.
 
In November 2006, the

Chicago Tribune

detailed a 2005 real estate deal in which Obama bought a sliver of vacant land adjacent to his home from Rezko's wife. Although he paid fair market price for the land, Obama later called the deal ""boneheaded"" on his part, as it came at a time when Rezko was widely known to be under federal investigation.
 
Rezko also has been a longtime, key fundraiser for Obama, dating back to Obama's campaigns to become an Illinois senator. In 2003, Rezko even hosted a cocktail party fundraiser for Obama.
 
In an effort to create distance, the Obama campaign has pledged that any money from Rezko or donors linked to him will go to charity.
 
""Mr. Rezko gave me campaign contributions,'' Obama told the

Chicago Sun-Times.

""While I was a state senator, he had buildings in my district that apparently were not managed properly. I had no knowledge of that at the time.''
 
Bottom line, Clinton's claim is Barely True. Obama, by his own admission, did some, albeit very little, legal work that helped Rezko's company obtain properties that would later be neglected. But the allegations that Rezko was a slumlord did not arise, at least not publicly, until years after Obama performed that work.

No evidence she said that
","Trying to depict Hillary Clinton as a flip-flopper on trade, Barack Obama claimed the New York senator considered the North American Free Trade Agreement a plus for the economy, even though she's recently criticized the pact on the campaign trail.
 
""I know that Hillary on occasion has said — just last year said this (NAFTA) was a boon to the economy,"" Obama said during a Jan. 21, 2008, debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C. ""I think it has been devastating, because our trade agreements did not have labor standards and environmental standards that would assure that workers in the U.S. were getting a square deal.""
 
Obama's charge is designed to stoke suspicions among liberals and labor leaders that Clinton is in the thrall of big business Democrats who served in her husband's administration, such as former Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin, chairman of Citigroup Inc., and ex-Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman, her top economic adviser.
 
Clinton, indeed, energetically promoted NAFTA in the past, thanking corporations for furthering its goals during an address to the 1998 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, and adding, ""It is certainly clear that we have not by any means finished the job that has begun.""
 
But even before she formally announced her candidacy, Clinton was expressing increased skepticism about globalization and questioning whether other nations were taking advantage of the United States' liberalized trade policies.
 
The critical tone intensified during the run-up to the Iowa caucuses. During an Oct. 8, 2007, speech in Iowa, she complained that New York apple growers had failed to gain access to Canadian markets while Canadian growers were having no such problems exporting their products to the United States, and blamed the Bush administration for not vigorously enforcing trade agreements.
 
""I think it is time that we assess trade agreements every five years to make sure they're meeting their goals or make adjustments if they are not and we should start with doing that with NAFTA,"" Clinton said.
 
The line attributed to Clinton about NAFTA being a ""boon"" to the economy appears to be based on an issues rundown in the Sept. 11, 2006, edition of

Newsday

in which the Long Island newspaper, in its own words, stated that Clinton believed the trade agreement to be a boon to the economy. The paper also pointed out that Clinton voted against the Central American-Dominican Republic Free Trade Agreement in 2005 because of concerns that it would drive jobs overseas.
 
Since announcing her candidacy, Clinton has, in fact, tried to distance herself from some of the free-trade policies her husband's administration pursued and repeatedly expressed concern and skepticism about the benefits of globalization.
 
In June 2007, she said NAFTA had some positive effects ""but unfortunately it had a lot of downside."" And at a debate in December 2007, she announced her intention to review and reform NAFTA if she were elected.
 
Obama implies Clinton views NAFTA as an unqualified success, but more importantly, he attributes words to her that only appear in a newspaper summary of the issues. We judge his statement to be False.

""While I was working on those streets watching those folks see their jobs shift overseas, you were a corporate lawyer sitting on the board at Wal-Mart,"" Obama said.
 
Obama is referring to the period from 1985 to 1988 when he was a community organizer in neighborhoods on Chicago's South Side. And he is correct that during that period, many employers in that area — particularly in the steel industry — were closing their plants and moving jobs overseas. U.S. Steel, for example, employed 40,000 people there in the 1970s but shut down operations in the mid 1980s.
 
Obama is correct about Clinton's tenure on the Wal-Mart board of directors. She was appointed to the board in 1986 when her husband was the governor of Arkansas and she served until 1992. As a board member, Clinton pushed for more women in management and a better environmental program, according to a

examination of her work on the board.
 
At the time, she worked as an attorney for the Rose Law Firm, which had many corporate clients such as Wal-Mart and Tyson Foods. Clinton specialized in patent infringement and intellectual property cases.

Black and white family net worth disparity true
","During a Democratic debate in Myrtle Beach, S.C. on Jan. 21, 2008, John Edwards elaborated on his vision of ""two Americas"" and showed empathy toward an important bloc of Democratic primary voters by pointing out racial disparities in net worth.
 
It came during a discussion about whether subprime lenders were targeting the most economically vulnerable people. He said he didn't know their motivations, but added:
 
""What they have done is targeted the lowest income, most vulnerable families,"" Edwards said. ""And anybody who's paying any attention to what's going on in America today understands, if you are African-American in this country today, you are likely to have a net worth of about 10 percent of what white families have.
 
""This is not an accident. I mean, we can go put our heads against the wall and pretend that the past never happened, pretend that we didn't live through decades of slavery, followed by decades of segregation, followed by decades of discrimination, which is still going on today.""
 
It appears the former North Carolina senator was relying on figures from the U.S. Census Bureau.
 
In 2000, the median net worth of a household headed by a non-Hispanic white adult was $79,400. The median net worth of a household run by a black adult was $7,500. The figure for Hispanic households was $9,750. These figures are based on a 2003 report.
 
Net worth is measured as the total value of a household's financial assets — such as bank accounts, property and vehicles — minus the household's financial liabilities. Though the measurement is an oft-used indicator of financial health, it doesn't always tell the whole story because the amount of income generated by a household's assets is a key factor in maintaining a desired standard of living.
 
Still, because Edwards correctly cites Census data showing a tenfold disparity between black and white net worth, we judge his statement True.
 
UPDATE: This corrects our first version, which mistakenly used the term family income when we meant net worth.

"['National', 'Military', 'Hillary Clinton']","
Her words are somewhat misleading
","The dig by Sen. Hillary Clinton makes the Bush administration's treatment of wounded veterans seem almost so heartless as to be implausible.
 
""The Bush administration sends mixed messages,"" Clinton said during the Democratic debate in Las Vegas. ""They want to recruit and retain these young people to serve our country and then they have the Pentagon trying to take away the signing bonuses when a soldier gets wounded and ends up in the hospital, something that I'm working with a Republican senator to try to make sure never can happen again.""
 
The Army suggests this issue may all be a tempest in a political teapot, that it simply made a clerical error in asking a wounded vet to return a portion of his signing bonus. But there's another issue, one that may be a bit more legitimate: whether wounded soldiers ought to be guaranteed future installments of enlistment bonuses, bonuses pegged to future years of service they were not able to complete.
 
In 2007, nearly 39,000 army recruits received an average of $16,500 in enlistment bonuses, according to Maj. Nathan M. Banks Sr. of the Department of the Army Public Affairs.
 
The issue Clinton addresses was first raised in July 2007 by the bipartisan Dole-Shalala Commission, when, in the course of work with veterans and their families, they noticed that ""service members' remaining enlistment bonuses were not being paid when they were injured and medically retired or separated from active duty."" The Defense Department assured the problem was fixed.
 
In October 2007, Rep. Jason Altmire, D-Pa., introduced the Veterans Guaranteed Bonus Act to formally ensure that wounded veterans are paid the entirety of any signing bonus they were promised within 30 days after discharge for combat-related wounds.
 
A Senate version of the bill was introduced by Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Ala., in November 2007. The Senate bill has 18 co-sponsors, including Clinton.
 
The issue gathered steam that month when a Pittsburgh television station reported the story of Jordan Fox, an army private who was partially blinded in one eye from the explosion of a roadside bomb in Iraq. After Fox returned home with a medical discharge, he got a letter from the Army asking him to repay $2,800 of a $7,500 enlistment bonus.
 
While Fox was held up by many politicians as Exhibit A in the case for the new legislation, his case also may have muddied the waters.
 
The Army says it simply made an ""error in pay processing.""
 
Defense Department policy is clear: Bonuses already paid should not be recouped if ""injury or illness of the service member was not the result of the service member's misconduct.""
 
The Army contends Fox's was an isolated case. In fact, when it set up a hotline for pay problems, it received just two calls on that issue.
 
So are we talking about legislation to fix a problem that may have affected just three people? As it relates to wounded soldiers having to return portions of paid bonuses, perhaps. And certainly a lot of politicians made a lot of political hay about that.
 
But that's different than unpaid, future installments of bonuses. Say a soldier who got a $10,000 up-front bonus, and was promised an additional $5,000 at the end of each of three years of completed duty. If he was injured and medically discharged in his first year of service, would he get the final two years of unpaid bonuses?
 
Defense Department policy there is less clear. The secretary of the Military Department may decide to pay the soldier unpaid installments if he or she determines that not paying would be ""against equity and good conscience, or contrary to the best interests of the United States.""
 
The legislation Clinton co-sponsored would require the military to pay all future installments upon medical discharge.
 
No one knows, still, how many wounded veterans this may affect. The Congressional Budget Office informally told congressional staffs that the proposed legislation — to include unpaid installments — might cost about $1-million a year. That may seem like a lot of money, but considering the number of wounded vets, it doesn't suggest they think this is a widespread, institutional problem. The Senate bill seeks an accounting by the military to find out.
 
So while Clinton highlights a legitimate issue — paying future installments of enlistment bonuses even after wounded veterans have been discharged — her wording is somewhat misleading, suggesting wounded veterans are being forced to return bonus money. There is little evidence to suggest that happened to more than a couple veterans, and the Army admitted its mistake.
 
Also misleading is her suggestion that there was some kind of Bush administration effort to deny future bonus payments promised to wounded vets.
 
But she may be right that some were denied future bonus payments (although it is far from clear that this is still happening), and the legislation co-sponsored by Clinton would make it crystal clear they are to be paid. And so we rate her statement Half True.

Obama not a Reagan Democrat
","Stumping for his wife, Bill Clinton made an eyebrow-raising attack on Sen. Barack Obama, suggesting Obama's allegiance is with Republican ideas. What?
 
""Her (Hillary's) principal opponent said that since 1992, the Republicans have had all the good ideas,"" Clinton told a crowd in Pahrump, Nev., on Jan. 18, 2008. ""…So now it turns out you can choose between somebody who thinks our ideas are better or the Republicans had all the good ideas.""
 
At a campaign rally two days later in Buffalo, N.Y., Bill Clinton revisited the attack: ""[Obama] said President Reagan was the engine of innovation and did more, had a more lasting impact on America than I did. And then the next day he said, 'In the '90s, the good ideas came out from the Republicans.' ""
 
Here's what Obama actually said:
 
""I do think that, for example, the 1980 election was different,"" Obama told the editorial board of the

Reno Gazette-Journal

on Jan. 14. ""I mean, I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that, you know, Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not.""
 
And a little later...
 
""I think it's fair to say the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years, in the sense that they were challenging conventional wisdom.""
 
Hillary Clinton also twisted Obama's words.
 
""I have to say, you know, my leading opponent the other day said that he thought the Republicans had better ideas than Democrats the last 10 to 15 years,"" she said at an economic roundtable in Las Vegas on Jan. 18.
 
Clinton said she didn't consider it a better idea to privatize Social Security, eliminate the minimum wage, undercut health benefits, shut down the government or drive the country into debt.
 
John Edwards piled on, too: ""Ronald Reagan, the man who busted unions, the man who did everything in his power to destroy the organized labor movement, the man who created a tax structure that favored the richest Americans against middle class and working families... we know that Ronald Reagan is not an example of change for a presidential candidate running in the Democratic Party.""
 
Instead of a long point-by-point comparison of the politics of Obama versus Reagan, let's just put this to bed by giving Obama's comments a fuller context.
 
During the 49-minute editorial board meeting, Obama was essentially asked how long his coattails might be for other candidates in House and Senate races. His response lasted a few minutes, but here's a bit of what he said:
 
""I think that we're shifting the political paradigm here. And if I'm the nominee, I think I can bring a lot of folks along on my coattails. You know, there's a reason why in 2006, I made the most appearances for members of Congress. I was the most requested surrogate to come in and campaign for people in districts that were swing districts, Republican districts where they wouldn't have any other Democrat.
 
""That was based on their read of the fact that, you know what, this is somebody who can reach out to independents and Republicans in a way that doesn't offend people. … I don't want to present myself as some sort of singular figure. I think part of what's different are the times.
 
""I do think that, for example, the 1980 election was different. I mean, I think Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that, you know, Richard Nixon did not and in a way that Bill Clinton did not. He put us on a fundamentally different path because the country was ready for it. They felt like, you know, with all the excesses of the '60s and the '70s and government had grown and grown but there wasn't much sense of accountability in terms of how it was operating and he tapped into what people were already feeling. Which is, people wanted clarity, we want optimism, we want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that had been missing, all right? I think Kennedy, 20 years earlier, moved the country in a fundamentally different direction. So I think a lot of it just has to do with the times.
 
""I think we're in one of those times right now. Where people feel like things as they are going aren't working. We're bogged down in the same arguments that we've been having, and they're not useful.""
 
And does this next part sound like a Republican sympathizer?
 
""And, you know, the Republican approach, I think, has played itself out. I think it's fair to say the Republicans were the party of ideas for a pretty long chunk of time there over the last 10, 15 years, in the sense that they were challenging conventional wisdom. Now, you've heard it all before. You look at the economic policies when they're being debated among the presidential candidates and it's all tax cuts. Well, you know, we've done that, we tried it. That's not really going to solve our energy problems, for example. So, some of it's the times. And some of it's, I think, there's maybe a generation element to this, partly ... I didn't come of age in the battles of the '60s. I'm not as invested in them.
 
""And so I think I talk differently about issues. And I think I talk differently about values. And that's why I think we've been resonating with the American people.""
 
Steve Falcone, opinion editor for the

Reno Gazette-Journal,

who led the interview, said he didn't give the comment much thought until it blew up with Bill Clinton's retort.
 
 
""I was surprised by the way it got spun,"" Falcone said.
 
""To me, it was in the context of the need for change and leadership,"" he said. ""It was an example that a lot of people can appreciate, that Reagan created a coalition because he had ideas. I didn't think at the time that he was aligning himself with any Republican ideas. It never occurred to me listening to it that he (Obama) was agreeing with the politics of Ronald Reagan.""
 
Four days after he visited, the paper endorsed Obama in the Democratic primary.
 
Our take, Obama may want to think twice before invoking the R-word again any time soon. But in this case, it was little more than a sound bite taken out of context and twisted. Obama never said Republicans have all the good ideas. We rate Bill Clinton's statement False. Hillary's too, for that matter.

Did Hillary Clinton have her name on only three laws in eight years as Jeb Bush says?
","As Jeb Bush reels off his accomplishments as governor cutting taxes and slashing state jobs, he says he’s ready to put his record up against Hillary Clinton’s. A day after his announcement speech at Miami Dade College, Fox News’ Sean Hannity asked Bush to comment on the Democrat’s record. Hannity: ""Can you name in a serious way one specific Hillary accomplishment, or what would you say that's good about her?"" Bush: ""She's smart. I think she's smart. I think she loves her country. I don't ascribe bad motives for people that I don't agree with. But as a senator, I think she passed -- she has her name on three laws in eight years."" There is some truth to Bush’s claim about laws passed, but it doesn’t tell the full story about her legislative accomplishments as a senator. Laws with Clinton’s name Clinton was first elected as a senator from New York in 2000 and re-elected in 2006. She resigned to become secretary of state, so her Senate tenure was from January 2001 to January 2009. Bush’s spokesman sent us a list of three bills Clinton sponsored that became law. These laws were uncontroversial matters that passed by unanimous consent in the Senate and voice vote in the House and then were signed by President George W. Bush: S. 1241:  A bill to establish the Kate Mullany National Historic Site in the State of New York. Bush signed the bill Dec. 3, 2004. S. 3613: A bill to name a post office the ""Major George Quamo Post Office Building."" Bush signed the bill Oct. 6, 2006. S. 3145: A bill to designate a highway in New York as the Timothy J. Russert highway. Bush signed the bill July 23, 2008. But there are other ways that Senators can influence legislation even if they don’t end up as the sponsor of the final version: Co-sponsored bills: There were 74 bills that became law that Clinton co-sponsored. For example, she was one of 54 cosponsors on the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, signed in January 2009 by President Barack Obama. (The fact that she co-sponsored these bills doesn’t tell us much about her role in their passage, but Bush referred to bills that ""she has her name"" on, so it’s worth noting those she co-sponsored.) She co-sponsored one version but another version passed: For example, she co-sponsored S.1, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act in January 2009 while the version that passed was H.R. 1. Sponsored amendments: She put forward amendments that influenced laws sponsored by others. She sponsored three amendments on a bill for security and disaster funding. The amendments passed in 2007 and the bill passed in 2008. Two experts who study Congress -- Norman Ornstein, a scholar at American Enterprise Institute, and Sarah Binder, a political science professor at George Washington University and Brookings Institution scholar -- said that the number of sponsored or co-sponsored bills signed into law isn’t a thorough measure of effectiveness or productivity for a member of the Senate. ""Offering amendments on the floor, holding hearings, contributing to oversight, helping to negotiate agreements, pushing federal agencies to be responsive to constituents back home -- all of these might contribute to making a senator ‘effective,’ but none of these endeavors of course would show up in a count of bills sponsored or passed or enacted,"" Binder said. As for Bush’s claim about the number of laws ""she has her name on,"" Binder said that it’s fair game to also look at the number of bills Clinton co-sponsored. ""Because ‘have her name on’ is so vague, I don't see the grounds on which to exclude co-sponsored bills,"" she said.   Ornstein said that the names that go on bills of any real significance are the committee chairs -- for example the Dodd-Frank 2010 banking reform bill. Sen. Chris Dodd and U.S. Rep. Barney Frank were the major figures behind the law, but other senators also had roles and don’t have their names on the bill. Meanwhile, the Affordable Care Act ""does not have Al Franken's name on it, but a really important provision, the medical-loss ratio, was his handiwork,"" Ornstein said. ""Effectiveness can be a behind-the-scenes role, adding a serious amendment, working inside to get the language exactly right. By any reasonable standard, including the private comments of her colleagues on both sides of the aisle when she was in the Senate, she was very effective."" Our ruling Bush said that as a senator, Clinton had her name ""on three laws in eight years."" Bush used vague language here, so it’s fair game to look at the three sponsored bills and the 74 co-sponsored ones that passed. Also, congressional experts warn that legislative influence goes beyond having your name as a sponsor or co-sponsor. Senators weigh in with amendments, debate and negotiations. The statement is partially accurate, but leaves out important details so we rate this claim Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/57684e12-55f1-4abd-aa03-85984b69d701",[<zip object at 0x000002809702E240>],/factchecks/2015/jun/23/jeb-bush/did-hillary-clinton-have-her-name-only-three-laws-/
"['Georgia', 'Public Safety', 'Guns', 'Hank Johnson']","
Johnson errs describing airport gun, right about capacity
","When Jim Cooley carried his AR-15 rifle fully loaded with a 100-round drum into Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport last month, it revived a Georgia congressman’s efforts to restrict weapons in airports nationwide. U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson, D-Lithonia, cited the incident in again proposing the Airport Security Act, which would ban loaded weapons outside airports’ security areas. Federal law already bans carrying weapons through airport security checkpoints. ""Two weeks ago, a man entered the world’s busiest airport in Atlanta, Georgia, carrying a loaded AR-15 automatic weapon with an extended capacity, 100-round magazine,"" Johnson said in a House floor speech June 15. ""Mr. Speaker, actions like this, which follow shootings at airports in Los Angeles and Houston, undermine public security in the same way as yelling ‘fire’ in a crowded theater."" Johnson’s proposal has been assigned to the House Homeland Security Committee, where the political battle over gun control will continue. But something in the rhetoric caught our eye for a closer look. Was the rifle in question at our airport an automatic weapon? THE HISTORY The AR-15 that Cooley carried is most likely the most popular such rifle on the market today. That is in part because several variants have been made since Colt started selling its version of the rifle as a semi-automatic weapon to civilians in the early 1960s. One modified version of the firearm was adopted as the M-16 rifle, deployed by the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War era. Several different manufacturers have since made versions of the rifle for private use. But the term ""AR-15"" has consistently been used to refer to the semi-automatic version Colt made popular. A fully automatic version is not sold directly to civilians. The federal assault weapons ban prohibited some versions of the AR-15 – such as those with collapsible stocks and bayonet lug – sold to civilians between 1994 and 2004. However, AR-15s built before the ban were legal – as were versions designed to comply with the federal law. Those loopholes effectively kept various forms of the AR-15 in production. For instance, admitted movie theater shooter James Holmes used a version of the AR-15 in the Aurora, Colo., massacre in 2012 that would have been illegal under the federal ban. But similar versions, including the Colt Match Target rifle, would have been legal, according to a 2004 University of Pennsylvania study funded by the National Institute of Justice. AUTOMATIC VERSUS SEMI-AUTOMATIC So, it’s clear the rifles can be deadly. In fact, semi-automatic weapons are often more deadly than the scarier sounding automatic versions, said Jay Corzine, a sociology professor at the University of Central Florida. That boils down to the difference between the two: Automatic weapons fire continuously when the shooter pulls the trigger once. The firing stops only when you release the trigger. Semi-automatic weapons will automatically reload, but the shooter must pull the trigger for each shot fired. Many law enforcement agencies that use small arms rifles, such as for SWAT teams, prefer semi-automatic weapons because there is less recoil in firing them. That allows for better aim, Corzine said. Nearly all AR-15 rifles are manufactured as semi-automatic weapons, in part because of that accuracy. However, gun shops do sell converter kits and manuals, which allow the rifles to be turned into automatic weapons that wouldn’t differ at a glance from the semi-automatic version, Corzine said. ""An automatic firing mechanism is not more lethal in number of people killed, but you will end up with more people hit,"" Corzine said. ""If you are shooting into a crowd, you’re going to hit a lot of people."" IN GEORGIA The 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting that killed 26 children and school staff prompted Connecticut, Maryland and New York to join three other states with heavy restrictions or outright bans on the AR-15. But Georgia is not one of the states with restrictions. Likewise, Cooley was legally able to sling his AR-15 over his chest because of a 2010 state law that allows weapons in areas not covered by airport security. Cooley, who lives in Winder, said he brought his gun and the high-capacity magazine for safety when dropping off his daughter for a flight. His weapon, he said, is a semi-automatic rifle. ""If you look at the video, the officer called my rifle an automatic weapon, and I had to correct her,"" said Cooley, who posted a video of his visit to the airport while carrying the weapon. ""It is a semi-automatic rifle. To say it’s not is untrue. You can’t just say anything you want on the House floor."" In his floor statements, Johnson cited the economic role that airports, especially Hartsfield-Jackson, play in communities as a reason to regulate guns for safety concerns. Johnson was at meetings in the United Nations when we reached out to him. Ben Waldon, his director of intergovernmental affairs, told us the congressman concedes he misspoke in calling Cooley’s weapon an automatic rather than a semi-automatic weapon. Waldon added that the 100-round drum also was a concern, regardless of the status of the weapon. Studies indicate limiting high-capacity magazines can affect gun violence since they are involved in more crimes (about 25 percent) than automatic and semi-automatic weapons (2 percent to 8 percent). Small-capacity magazines require the shooter to reload, which gives bystanders a chance to intervene as they did in the 2011 shooting of U.S. Rep. Gabby Giffords that killed six. ""Mr. Cooley’s weapon was a semi-automatic. But it is an assault rifle, with a high-capacity magazine,"" Waldon said. ""The congressman feels these kinds of weapons stoke fear, not civility, and the incident in Atlanta demonstrates the extremes of allowing these kinds of guns in airports."" OUR RULING U.S. Rep. Hank Johnson cited a recent incident of a man carrying his AR-15 rifle in Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in reviving his efforts to ban weapons from all areas of airports. Johnson called the gun an ""automatic weapon,"" something he and his staff concede was incorrect. The gun owner has confirmed he owns the semi-automatic version of the rifle. That is the more common make of this weapon, although all sides and experts acknowledge the weapon can be converted to an automatic weapon. The bigger concern was the 100-magazine drum. Even in a semi-automatic weapon, that would allow a shooter to fire 100 rounds before reloading, the scary prospect that Johnson appeared to want to reference in his statement. Johnson got the gun wrong, the magazine for the weapon right. For that reason, we rate Johnson’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D11F40>],/factchecks/2015/jun/23/hank-johnson/johnson-errs-description-airport-gun-right-about-c/

Barack Obama tweets that U.S. gun-homicide rate is much higher than in France, Israel, Japan
","Ever since nine people were killed by a gunman at a historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C., President Barack Obama has taken to various forums to discuss the issue of gun violence in the United States. In a tweet sent from his @POTUS account on June 20, 2015 -- three days after the killings -- Obama said, ""Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel."" The tweet clearly struck a nerve; within the first three days, Obama’s message was retweeted almost 40,000 times and favorited almost 30,000 times. The data appear to come from a credible source, a study by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime. The Guardian, a British newspaper, used raw data from that U.N. report to create a streamlined, country-by-country table showing selected measurements. One of the metrics included in that table was homicide rate by firearm per 100,000 population. Here are the rates for the four countries Obama cited, according to the Guardian: United States: 2.97 per 100,000 Japan: 0.01 per 100,000 France: 0.06 per 100,000 Israel: 0.09 per 100,000 Using this data, the United States has a rate 297 times higher than Japan, 49.5 times higher than France and 33 times higher than Israel -- precisely as Obama said. We will note a few caveats, all of them common for this kind of claim. The data is a bit old. It's from 2007 (for the United States, France and Israel) and 2008 (for Japan). The data is not ideally standardized. The data is culled from various international sources that have different standards and degrees of quality control. There is at least one different data set. A website produced by the University of Sydney in Australia, gunpolicy.org, has data from the World Health Organization and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that is slightly different. The ratio was 3.4 times higher than Israel in 2011, and almost 18 times higher for France in 2010. (Japan can't be easily calculated because its rate approaches zero.) Still, the broad patterns held. David Hemenway, a professor of health policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, urged caution in making international comparisons, but he added that Obama seems to use the available data responsibly. ""The exact numbers change every year and can change a fair amount since the number of homicides from these other countries are so low each year,"" he said. Still, he added, ""the story the data tell is largely the same whichever source or year is used."" Our ruling Obama tweeted, ""Here are the stats: Per population, we kill each other with guns at a rate 297x more than Japan, 49x more than France, 33x more than Israel."" It’s always worth being cautious of international comparisons of crime statistics, given technical limitations with the data. But even if some data sources produce different numbers than the ones Obama cited, the general pattern is the same -- the United States has firearm homicide rates many times higher than those in the three countries mentioned. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DC2E00>],/factchecks/2015/jun/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-tweets-us-gun-homicide-rate-much-high/

Confederate flag wasn't flown at South Carolina statehouse until 1961, pundit claims
","The Confederate flag flying outside of South Carolina’s statehouse has sparked debate across the nation following the brutal shooting at Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston. At the center of much of the fervor is what the flag stands for. For some, the flag is a symbol for a shared Southern heritage. For others, the flag is linked to the Confederate War Memorial, which sits next to it and honors fallen Confederate soldiers. And yet others, such as Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson, see the flag as a symbol for racial oppression and prejudice. ""Do you know when that flag was first flown at the Columbia statehouse in Columbia?"" he asked during an interview on Meet the Press June 21. ""1961 … it was a middle finger directed at the federal government. It was flown there as a symbol of massive resistance to racial desegregation. Period."" ""It was only after Brown vs. Board, after Little Rock, after desegregation began, that South Carolinians put up the flag on the statehouse, that other states in the South adopted the battle flag as part of their state flags,"" Robinson said. ""So it was massive resistance."" Here we wanted to to answer two questions. One is simple, when did the Confederate battle flag first fly above the South Carolina statehouse? And second, why? The first time it flew Daniel Hollis, a member of the commission responsible for planning South Carolina’s Confederate War Centennial, recalled the exact day the flag was first hoisted during an interview published in 1999. Hollis said the flag itself went up on April 11, 1961, for the opening of the Civil War centennial ""at the request of Aiken Rep. John A. May."" ""May told us he was going to introduce a resolution to fly the flag for a year from the capitol. I was against the flag going up,"" Hollis said, ""but I kept quiet and went along."" The resolution was approved in 1962, but never included a date for the flag’s removal. ""It just stayed up,"" Hollis said. ""Nobody raised a question."" Hollis died in 2008. The flag’s changing meaning So, yes, the flag didn’t start flying until 100 years after the start of the Civil War. But why the flag was flown is -- like the flag itself -- subject to some debate. Robinson cited a study conducted by the state Senate of Georgia to help make his case. Although the study focuses on the history and evolution of Georgia’s state flag, it also explores the different Confederate flags that have existed and how those flags have been used by states. The study pays special attention to what the different flags mean. ""It must be understood how the meaning of the battle flag has changed since the Civil War and explore what it meant at the time Georgia and other states adopted it or paid homage to it,"" the report reads. The study says that ""from the end of the Civil War until the late 1940s, display of the battle flag was mostly limited to Confederate commemorations, Civil War re-enactments, and veterans’ parades. The flag had simply become a tribute to Confederate veterans."" However, in 1948, the meaning of the flag began to change. That year, Dixiecrats flew the flag at their convention in Birmingham, Ala., as ""a symbol of Southern protest and resistance to the federal government."" In 1954, the Supreme Court ruled in Brown vs. Board that segregation in education was unconstitutional. Georgia changed its state flag to embody the Confederate battle flag two years later. The period also saw Rosa Parks refuse to give up her seat on the bus (1955), the forced integration at Little Rock, Ark. (1957), and student sit-ins across the South (1960). We asked K. Michael Prince, author of Rally 'Round the Flag, Boys: South Carolina and the Confederate Flag, if he could pinpoint the root cause behind the raising of the Confederate battle flag in South Carolina. ""As far as I've been able to determine, the bare facts … provide no clear evidence either way,"" Prince said. ""It's possible that nobody had anything else in mind other than commemorating the war. But we would be remiss not to take the larger context into consideration in judging the meaning of the display,"" Prince said. Specifically, Prince cites arguments that broke out between a New Jersey centennial delegation and South Carolina. The National Civil War Centennial Commission meeting was to be held at a segregated hotel in Charleston, and a black delegate from New Jersey was denied admittance. New Jersey threatened to boycott all Charleston events in response. Eventually, a compromise was reached through the efforts of President John F. Kennedy. The meeting was moved to Charleston Naval Base where segregation was not in effect. ""The official opening of the Civil War Centennial became a divided event, with dual headquarters and dual programs,"" Prince wrote in his book. ""Except for a few luncheon speeches and the events held at Fort Sumter, centennial function followed separate (but equal) tracks."" The dispute between New Jersey and South Carolina would go on to become the ""Number 1 Story of the Year"" in South Carolina’s Sumter Daily Item. Our ruling Robinson stated that when the Confederate flag was first flown over South Carolina’s statehouse in 1961, and it was hoisted as a symbol of ""massive resistance to racial desegregation."" Robinson is right on the date. The flag first flew over the statehouse to mark the opening ceremonies of a Civil War Centennial celebration. Whether it was raised as a deliberate symbol of a ""resistance to racial desegregation"" is not completely clear. Experts and research find a circumstantial link between the spread of the flag and the racial divisions of the 1950s and 1960s.

Beyer says more than half of moms under 30 are unwed
","Rep. Don Beyer says the U.S. needs to help young moms raising children on their own.   ""A growing percentage of women are single mothers; more than half of women under 30 who give birth do so outside of marriage and consequently serve a significant economic role for that child,"" Beyer, D-8th, says on his congressional website.   We wondered if it’s true that most women under 30 having babies are unwed.     Tia Shuyler, Beyer’s spokeswoman, pointed us to a series of reports and news articles on births to single mothers. But none of the sources provided a definitive source for the claim, so we went to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which keeps detailed records on births in the U.S. and mothers’ marital status.   The proportion of babies born to unmarried mothers has generally risen during the last 75 years, according to CDC figures. In 1940, 3.8 percent of all births were to unmarried women. By 2009, 41 percent of all births were to unmarried moms.   But Beyer’s statement required deeper research because it focused on women under 30. CDC records show that in 2005, 49 percent of babies born to women under 30 were born out of wedlock. They crossed 50 percent for the age group in 2006 and reached 54 percent in 2009. Amid the halting recovery from the Great Recession, the number has remained essentially flat.   So the bottom line is that the proportion out-of-wedlock births -- both for all mothers and those under 30 -- has recently been stagnant, but historically has increased.   Isabell Sawhill, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, offered a couple of reasons for the the long-term increases. One is that women have more opportunities to provide for themselves and their children outside of marriage and don’t feel the need to have a husband to support them, she said.   ""Marriage is on the decline is the simple explanation,"" Sawhill said. ""Each generation is marrying less than the previous one. If you take the women under the age of 30, you are talking about the youngest generation, so the proportion having children outside of marriage is larger because they are the most recent generation.""   Social norms could also be playing a part, Sawhill said.   ""It used to be if you had a baby outside of marriage, you were stigmatized,"" she said. ""That is no longer true. It’s so common now, it is quite accepted.""   The U.S. Census Bureau, in a 2013 report , also examined the proportion of unmarried moms under 30. It found about half of such mothers who gave birth in 2010 and 2011 were unwed.   The younger the mother, the higher chance of her being single. Of mothers age 15 to 19 with a recent birth, 86.1 percent of them had their babies out of wedlock. Among women age 20 to 24 with a recent birth, 61.5 percent of them weren’t married, and 31.9 percent of mothers age 25-29 had their babies outside marriage.   Many reports, including from The New York Times and The Urban Institute, have noted that for unmarried women under 30, their birth rate has been declining in recent years. Many analysts attribute the fall-off at least partly to the economy as some mothers put off having babies or decide not to have them at all.   For mothers of all ages, the birth rate has been going down, but preliminary CDC figures for 2014 showed an uptick.   Our ruling   Beyer said ""more than half of women under 30 do so outside of marriage.""   Government figures back up his assertion. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097ACEF80>],/factchecks/2015/jun/22/don-beyer/beyer-says-more-half-moms-under-30-are-unwed/

""When Mexico sends its people, they’re not sending their best,"" Trump said as he announced his White House bid. ""They’re sending people that have lots of problems, and they’re bringing those problems (to) us. They’re bringing drugs. They’re bringing crime. They’re rapists. And some, I assume, are good people."" That last phrase hardly counterbalanced the rest. Mexican officials took serious offense. The interior minister said the charge was absurd and prejudiced, and that it served only to generate controversy. The Daily Show’s Jon Stewart had a go at Trump with former President Bill Clinton on June 17, 2015. Clinton: ""What he said about the Mexicans, which was …"" Stewart: ""Bizarre."" Clinton: ""Not only that, just wrong. Basically between 2010 and 2014, there was no net in-migration from Mexico. That surprise you all?  All we read about is the violence and the drug war. The truth is that the previous president built 140 tuition free universities. Two years ago, the Mexicans produced 113,000 engineers. We produced 120,000. They’ve had very brisk growth, and except in the narco-centers, the crime rate, the murder rate has gone down. It’s a very interesting country."" There’s plenty of interesting statistics there, but we’ll focus just on the one about zero net in-migration. We asked the Clinton Foundation for the data behind that claim but didn’t hear back. Still, we were able to reach experts who were able to walk us through the numbers. One way to measure net migration (the number of new arrivals versus the number who leave) is the count of people living in America who were born in Mexico. The Census Bureau tracks this. We used two sets of numbers from the American Community Survey -- an estimate based on three years of surveys and an estimate based on just the year the survey took place. Year Born in Mexico 3-year average estimate (1,000s) 1-year estimate (1,000s) 2013 11,604 11,585 2012 11,650 11,563 2011 11,700 11,673 2010 11,642 11,711 Source: American Community Survey While there’s a little variation, both estimates show a drop from 2010 to 2013. Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, a group that favors reduced immigration, told us that the Mexican-born figures are a valid indicator of the overall trend. ""This strongly implies zero net (migration),"" Camarota said. Another researcher, Marc Rosenblum at the Migration Policy Institute, echoed that point. What about 2014? That’s the end point for Clinton’s comparison, but finalized numbers aren’t out yet. To get a sense of what the numbers might say, Camarota dug into the raw monthly counts from the Current Population Survey. These figures are less reliable, but they too show a consistent decline for Mexicans living in the United States in each of the first quarters of 2012 through 2014.  (Camarota did find a rise in the first quarter of 2015, but that is outside Clinton’s window.) We should note that using a population count isn’t a perfect yardstick. In theory, a higher death rate could drive the numbers down, but that’s unlikely. First, it would be headline news if thousands of people started dying like that. Second, Rosenblum noted that Mexican immigrants tend to be in their prime working years and younger people are healthier. A more complete study of net migration from Mexico came out in 2012. The Pew Research Center reported back then that based on census data from both sides of the border, from 2005 to 2010, more people moved from America to Mexico than the reverse. That study raised the possibility that the net migration rate wasn’t just zero -- it might actually be negative. Rosenblum thinks that’s probably still true because some factors behind the shift show no sign of letting up. In short, Clinton is right on the general trend experts agree, though we don’t yet have the numbers for 2014 to completely confirm his point. Four reasons for the decline Demographics is possibly the biggest driver of the change in migration. The birth rate in Mexico has fallen steadily since at least 1990 and now stands at 2.2 children per woman. Rosenblum said that translates into fewer people coming into the workforce. ""In the 1980s, there was a surge of teenagers,"" Rosenblum said. ""With the birth rate having been down for several decades, we’re now seeing many fewer Mexicans entering the prime working age group."" Rosenblum said apprehensions at the border strongly suggest that fewer people are trying to sneak into the country. Data from the U.S. Border Patrol show a drop of more than 50 percent since 2009. It used to be border agents stopped over half a million people coming in from Mexico. Last year, it was about 230,000. Not all of those people were Mexican, but the numbers are in line with the picture Clinton paints. Rosenblum also believes that more surveillance, stiffer penalties and more barriers at the border have had the intended effect. ""All that enforcement has begun to pay off,"" he said. Other drivers include the hit on the construction industry during the recession. That was a sector that drew many immigrants and while it has recovered a bit, it is not nearly as robust as it once was. Plus, according to one survey, Mexicans who return to their native country generally find that they make more money than when they left. Our ruling Clinton said that between 2010 and 2014, there was zero net in-migration from Mexico. The census data to prove that is not in for 2014, but the numbers up to 2013 support his point, as do very preliminary 2014 data.The population of people living in America but born in Mexico fell by about 40,000 since 2010. That’s not a perfect measure, but the experts we reached said it is a strong indication of a prevailing trend. The experts we reached said that other data, including a rapid decline in apprehensions at the border and changing demographics in Mexico add weight to the conclusion that Clinton was correct. With a caveat for the missing year of survey information, we rate this claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C162080>],/factchecks/2015/jun/22/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-zero-net-migration-mexico-2010/

Is Barack Obama correct that mass killings don't happen in other countries?
","After a gunman shot and killed nine worshippers in a historic African-American church in Charleston, S.C., President Barack Obama took to the White House podium the next day to ""express our deep sorrow over the senseless murders."" In his June 18, 2015, remarks from the White House, Obama said, ""Now is the time for mourning and for healing. But let’s be clear: At some point, we as a country will have to reckon with the fact that this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency. And it is in our power to do something about it."" A flurry of PolitiFact readers -- some of them prompted by articles objecting to Obama’s claim -- wrote to us to ask us to check it, so we did. An important point to make right off the bat is that many of the critics have pointed to the first part of Obama’s claim -- that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" As we’ll explain, the critics have a point here -- mass violence, including mass shootings, happen in a wide variety of countries. However, the critics have truncated the quotation, leaving off the next sentence -- that ""it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" That’s also not fully correct, but it’s not quite as wrong as the first claim. The White House argues that Obama's second sentence qualifies the first, and added that PunditFact rated Mostly True the claim that ""Americans are 20 times as likely to die from gun violence as citizens of other civilized countries."" However, that claim refers to gun violence generally, not mass killings specifically, the topic of Obama's comment. For a look at the statistics, we checked with two researchers, Jaclyn Schildkraut of the State University of New York in Oswego and H. Jaymi Elsass of Texas State University. They have been collecting and analyzing mass-shooting incidents in 11 countries, covering the period from 2000 to 2014. Aside from the United States, the countries they studied are Australia, Canada, China, England, Finland, France, Germany, Mexico, Norway and Switzerland. (They also looked at less-developed countries, but we will exclude those since Obama specifically mentioned ""advanced"" countries.) Schildkraut and Elsass shared the summary information from their database with PolitiFact. Here’s their table:  The chart does show that the United States has more mass shootings -- and more people cumulatively killed or injured -- than the other 10 nations combined, partly because it has a much bigger population than all but China. Still, using this data, it’s easy to dispense with the first claim Obama made -- that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" Over the decade and a half studied, the researchers found 23 incidents of mass shootings in the other 10 countries, resulting in 200 dead and 231 wounded. In the United States over the same period, there were 133 incidents that left 487 dead and 505 wounded. Here are a just a few examples of mass shootings in other countries: • On July 22, 2011, a total of 80 people were killed in Norway when Anders Behring Breivik, a political extremist, bombed a government building in Oslo and then went on a shooting rampage on the island of Utoya, just outside the city. • On March 11, 2009, in Winnenden, Germany, a teenage gunman killed 15 people. The majority of the victims were children and teachers killed when the shooter opened fire in three classrooms in a local secondary school. The gunman shot two other people before killing himself after being cornered by the local police. • On Sept. 23, 2008, in Kuahajoki, Finland, a gunman shot 10 people to death after opening fire on a classroom in the Kuahajoki School of Hospitality. After killing the students, the shooter burned the victims’ bodies. In sum, then, Obama is wrong to say that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" Clearly it does happen elsewhere, and not in trivial numbers. Seven of the countries saw double-digit numbers of people killed in mass shootings during that period. By contrast, the second part of Obama’s claim -- that ""it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency"" -- isn’t entirely off-base. We compared mass shooting incidents across countries is to calculate the number of victims per capita -- that is, adjusted for the country’s total population size. Calculating it this way shows the United States in the upper half of the list of 11 countries, ranking higher than Australia, Canada, China, England, France, Germany and Mexico. Still, the U.S. doesn’t rank No. 1. At 0.15 mass shooting fatalities per 100,000 people, the U.S. had a lower rate than Norway (1.3 per 100,000), Finland (0.34 per 100,000) and Switzerland (1.7 per 100,000). We’ll note that all of these countries had one or two particularly big attacks and have relatively small populations, which have pushed up their per-capita rates. In Norway, that single attack in 2011 left 67 dead by gunfire (plus additional bomb casualties). Finland had two attacks, one that killed eight and one that killed 10. And Switzerland had one incident that killed 14. Still, while the United States did rank in the top one-third of the list, the fact that three other countries exceeded the United States using this method of comparison does weaken Obama’s claim that ""it doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" In at least three countries, the data shows, it does. Elsass warned PolitiFact of a few caveats about the data. While they believe their database ""to be among the most exhaustive compilations available,"" Elsass noted that it may not include every instance of mass shootings. It also doesn’t include every example of mass killings -- just those committed by firearms, even though mass stabbings are not uncommon in such places as China. Finally, their database doesn’t include acts generally considered to be terrorism, such as the attack in Paris on the satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo. ""If these were included, we are likely to see something much different statistically as there have been a number of very high-profile terrorist attacks in Europe, some including the use of firearms, that are excluded from the current analysis,"" she said. But in all likelihood, this would only make the case against Obama’s claim stronger. The bottom line is that it’s unwise to take these numbers as gospel -- but the figures from this database are clear enough to cast significant doubt on the accuracy of the specific claim Obama made. Our ruling Obama said after the church shootings in Charleston that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries. It doesn’t happen in other places with this kind of frequency."" The data shows that it clearly happens in other countries, and in at least three of them, there’s evidence that the rate of killings in mass-shooting events occurred at a higher per-capita rate than in the United States between 2000 and 2014. The only partial support for Obama’s claim is that the per-capita gun-incident fatality rate in the United States does rank in the top one-third of the list of 11 countries studied. On balance, we rate the claim Mostly False. EDITOR’S NOTE, June 22, 2015: We heard from several of you regarding Obama's use of the word ""frequency,"" and that frequency could refer to the incidents of mass shootings, not deaths as we examined. Looking at Obama's claim by incident, the United States has a higher rate of incidents than Finland, Norway and Switzerland. We agree that there is no preferred comparison and each is valid, and we've changed some language in this article to reflect that. We also agree that China has a larger population than the United States, a fact we weren't initially clear about but have since fixed. That said, we are sticking with our rating of Mostly False, in large measure because of Obama's claim that ""this type of mass violence does not happen in other advanced countries."" That is incorrect. We know some of you will disagree, and we'll be sure to air out some of your objections in our next reader mailbag.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D6D540>],/factchecks/2015/jun/22/barack-obama/barack-obama-correct-mass-killings-dont-happen-oth/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Military', 'Jeb Bush']","
Jeb Bush says Democrats 'responsible' for 'swift, mindless' cuts to defense spending
","The size and scope of the U.S. military is already becoming an issue on the presidential campaign trail. During his presidential campaign kickoff speech, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush criticized the Obama administration for leaving the military to wither. Among the bad decisions being made by ""the party now in the White House,"" Bush said, was ""the swift, mindless drawdown of a military that was generations in the making."" We decided to take a closer look at his claim. We’ll break it down into two key questions. Has there been a ""swift, mindless drawdown"" of the military? And are the Democrats ""responsible""? Has there been a 'swift, mindless drawdown' of the military? The Bush campaign confirmed that the candidate was referencing the military budget, so we’ll look there. The unified ""national security"" budget -- which includes both the Pentagon and related spending such as nuclear-weapons work by the Energy Department -- rose in 2010 and 2011, but has fallen every year since then, by a cumulative 15 percent over the four-year period. Other ways of looking at the question show declines as well. National security spending was 20.1 percent of the federal budget in 2010, but an estimated 15.9 percent in 2015. And over the same span, national-security spending fell from 4.6 percent of gross domestic product to 3.3 percent. These are genuine declines, in a fairly rapid time frame. There are two main reasons for this. The first is the Obama administration’s decision to start removing U.S. troops from Iraq and Afghanistan. This is clearly visible in the chart below, published by the Congressional Budget Office. To understand the chart, it’s important to know that in recent years, the defense budget has been divided into two categories -- the ""base budget,"" which funds basic, ongoing military needs, and the ""overseas contingency operations"" budget, which funds specific deployments, such as those in Afghanistan and Iraq. The lighter of those two lines, the overseas contingency operations budget, has fallen more dramatically during the past few years.      As the chart shows, the base budget has also been going down, partly because of a process known as sequestration. What’s sequestration? In 2011, the federal government was nearing its legal debt limit, which meant that Congress had to authorize a higher level for borrowing. House Republicans insisted that actual spending cuts be passed along with an increase to the debt limit. House Speaker John Boehner led negotiations with the White House, and at first the sides seemed to be moving toward a wide-ranging overhaul of the federal budget, dubbed the ""grand bargain."" However, the closed-door negotiations fell apart, and Republicans and Democrats came to a less ambitious debt-limit agreement, enacted as the Budget Control Act of 2011. The law included approximately $1.2 trillion in budget cuts spread over 10 years. But it also directed Congress to find another $1.2 trillion through a 12-member panel known as ""the super-committee."" As an incentive to action, the law included an unusual budget threat: If the super-committee couldn’t agree on a package, or if Congress voted it down, then automatic, across-the-board cuts would go into effect, with half of those cuts hitting defense. These automatic cuts are known as ""sequestration."" Sequestration was intended more as an incentive to get the two sides to negotiate than as a realistic policy alternative. However, when the super-committee failed to agree on a deficit-reduction package, sequestration cuts kicked in. These were across-the-board cuts -- not reductions to particular programs carefully selected by lawmakers -- and they included both domestic and military programs. While the defense budget had already been drifting downward under Obama, the impact of the sequester was noteworthy. ""The cut in defense spending in 2013, when sequestration went into effect, was the largest, single-year percentage cut in the Defense Department budget since the end of the Korean War, so I think that counts as ‘swift,’ "" said Todd Harrison, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments. ""And because the cut was initially through a sequester, which cuts all accounts by the same amount, it was also ‘mindless.’ "" So Bush has a point when he says the cuts have been ""swift"" and ""mindless."" But is the Obama administration solely to blame? No The Obama administration has already proposed spending increases for future years. The most recent Obama budget proposed a 7.8 percent increase in the base Defense Department budget between 2015 and 2016 -- clear evidence that he is seeking increased defense spending despite the continuing threat of sequestration. And the increase isn’t fleeting. CBO projections based on Defense Department requests show rising defense spending over the next five years. Taking account of inflation, defense spending is projected to rise by 8.8 percent between 2015 and 2019. The CBO also predicts increases above the rate of inflation as far in the future as 2030. ""Defense spending is rising modestly now even at Budget Control Act levels,"" said Mackenzie Eaglen, a resident fellow in security studies at the American Enterprise Institute. The Bush campaign argues that author Bob Woodward’s detailed book about fiscal negotiations has described the sequester as a Democratic invention. They also note that when House Republicans sought to use overseas contingency funding to go around the budget caps on military spending, Obama threatened a veto. However, a cross-section of experts told PolitiFact they see the two parties as co-owners of sequestration. Republicans in Congress voted for the law that set up its possibility. In the House, 174 Republicans and 95 Democrats voted for the law, while 66 Republicans and 95 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 269-161.) In the Senate, 28 Republicans and 45 Democrats voted for it, while 19 Republicans and 6 Democrats opposed it. (Final tally: Passed 74-26.) Two other laws that modified the terms of the sequester were also passed on a bipartisan basis -- the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 and the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013. ""The Budget Control Act was adopted by bipartisan majorities with a Republican House, Democratic Senate, and signed into law by a Democratic president,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""The failure of the super-committee was a bipartisan failure. This falls on both sides."" While Eaglen acknowledged that the White House initially came up with sequestration, she added that ""both parties are responsible for the drawdown. Many members of Congress voted for these military reductions, and the president signed them into law."" Harrison agreed. ""In a divided government, I don’t think it’s ever completely accurate to say that one party or the other is responsible for something,"" he said. ""What happened is that both parties took the defense budget hostage in the budget debate, and when both sides have the same hostage, it doesn’t work out well for the hostage."" He added that the administration has proposed a defense budget each year that was higher than what Congress ultimately enacted, with the exception of 2015, when Congress enacted spending at close to the level Obama proposed. ""So Congress has been providing less to the Defense Department than the administration has requested, but the president has signed each of those appropriations bills into law,"" he said. ""So I think the blame has to be shared."" Is the level of funding today, and in the near future, adequate for the military’s needs? Perhaps not surprisingly, there is less consensus on this question. Even taking into account sequestration, current defense spending is high by historical standards. As we noted, defense spending is estimated to be 3.3 percent of gross domestic in 2015. That’s higher than in the period immediately before 9/11 -- the years 1997 to 2002. Additionally, the current round of cuts ""are consistent with other post-war drawdowns, including Korea, Vietnam, and the Cold War,"" said Christopher A. Preble, the vice president for defense and foreign policy studies at the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank that favors lower defense spending. ""I believe that we are extraordinarily safe and secure, both by historic standards, and relative to any other country on earth,"" Preble said. To be sure, Eaglen said that military chiefs and civilian leaders have repeatedly said sequestration poses an intolerable risk to U.S. forces. ""I would agree,"" she said. At the same time, she added, the military brass has said that Obama’s proposed budget levels ""are acceptable. Putting aside how it’s funded -- through the overseas contingency budget or not -- the GOP Congress is giving the president"" what he wants. Our ruling Bush said Democrats are ""responsible"" for ""the swift, mindless drawdown of a military that was generations in the making."" There has certainly been a decline in military spending during much of Obama’s presidency, and to the extent that sequestration has contributed to this, it’s not unreasonable to call the cuts ""swift"" and ""mindless."" But to pin that solely on the Obama administration is wrong. Obama has proposed increases for defense spending beyond the rate of inflation lasting years into the future, and Bush’s decision to exclusively blame the Democrats for past cuts isn’t justified. It has taken two to tango, experts say. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D5E440>],/factchecks/2015/jun/22/jeb-bush/jeb-bush-says-democrats-responsible-swift-mindless/

Scott Walker says he has unusually strong appeal among young voters
","As Gov. Scott Walker moves closer to launching his presidential campaign, he’s working to distinguish himself from a crowd of contenders for the 2016 Republican nomination. Walker, one of the younger contenders in the field,  often reminds audiences he has successfully faced statewide voters three times since 2010. He took that talking point a step further June 2, 2015 when responding to a question in Florida about how the party can appeal to younger voters, especially after the dismal showing of Mitt Romney among young voters in 2012. President Barack Obama took 60 percent of the 18- to 24-year-old vote, compared with 36 percent for Romney. ""Last year, when I was up for election -- again, for the third time -- we won again,"" Walker said. ""But we carried -- one of the polls, exit polls -- showed we went 49-48 amongst 18- to 24-year-olds. That's largely unheard of for a Republican."" Was Walker’s performance among young voters in 2014 unusually strong for a Republican? Behind the numbers In November 2014, Walker defeated Democrat Mary Burke, 53 percent to 46 percent, to win a second term. He previously won a recall election in 2012. In 2014, Edison Research conducted an exit poll for a number of news organizations based on responses from voters after they left the polling place. In his claim, Walker specifically referenced voters 18 to 24 years old and said he ""carried"" that group. But Walker had the numbers reversed: Burke won 49 percent, while Walker had 48 percent, according to the exit poll. AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Our American Revival, Walker’s campaign exploratory group, said the governor misspoke. In the 2012 recall, Walker won that age group by 51 percent to 48 percent. Strong said he was thinking of that when he made the ""carried"" comment and mistakenly combined the 2012 edge with the 2014 numbers. However, it is important to note that the 18 to 24 year old segment in the 2014 exit poll included only 191 voters -- about 8 percent of the overall sample of 2,319 voters. That means it carries a large margin of error, said Joe Lenski, executive vice president for Edison. And that kind of margin of error for the subgroup makes analysis of that portion of the poll difficult. ""There’s really not much you can say other than among 18 to 24 year olds they were really close,"" Lenski said of Walker and Burke. How Walker compares But what about Walker’s broader point, that his appeal to young voters in 2014 was unusually strong for a Republican candidate? That’s difficult to measure as well, according to Lenski and Charles Franklin, a respected pollster and director of the Marquette Law School poll. Franklin suggested comparing Walker’s performance with young voters to that of other Republican governors who were up for re-election in November 2014. Here’s a look at three such races: Florida: Among 18 to 24 year olds, the exit poll showed Republican Gov. Rick Scott had 38 percent, while Democrat Charlie Crist and Libertarian Adrian Wyllie had a combined 62 percent. So Scott, who won reelection, did not fare as well as Walker. When you look at the broader group of 18- to 29-year olds, Scott had 41 percent. Michigan: In the 18 to 24 group, the exit poll showed Republican incumbent Rick Snyder had 46 percent, while Democrat Mark Schauer had 52 percent. Again, Walker fared a bit better than Snyder, who won reelection. Among 18- to 29-year olds, Snyder had 48 percent. Ohio: Numbers were not available for the 18 to 24 group, but  the exit poll showed Republican incumbent John Kasich won 56 percent of the 18 to 29 year olds, compared with 41 percent for his challenger, Ed Fitzgerald. In Wisconsin in 2014, Walker had 47 percent of the votes in that broader group, compared to 51 percent for Burke. So, Kasich fared better than Walker, but it should be noted he won reelection in a landslide, 64 percent to 33 percent. That points to another challenge with a claim such as the one made by Walker. Candidates don’t run by themselves. For voters, it is a choice between two (or even more) contenders. Lenski said younger voters nationally -- especially in the 25-29 year old group -- tend to lean Democratic, in part because of the excitement stirred by Obama’s first campaign in 2008. Strong, the Walker spokeswoman, pointed to a Nov. 7, 2014 story in The College Fix, a right-leaning web site that is written by college students. The story noted that in the 2014  election, ""overall, exit polls found voters age 18 to 29 favored Democratic candidates by a margin of 54 percent to 43 percent in U.S. House races, a trend often mirrored in Senate and gubernatorial races as well. Yet the youth vote was key in several of the battleground states where Republicans won."" So, generally speaking, Walker’s performance was better than that of a typical Republican among young voters. Our rating Walker said his performance in 2014 indicates that he appeals to young voters in a way ""that’s largely unheard of for a Republican."" He based his claim on a narrow group of voters -- 18 to 24 year olds. When we measured his claim against the performance of three other Republican governors for the same election he  fared better than two and not as well as the third, who won in a landslide. In any case, the data comes with a wide margin of error and should be used cautiously. As poll director Lenski said: the best we can say is that it was close. We rate Walker’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280978B7C40>],/factchecks/2015/jun/22/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-he-has-unusually-strong-appeal-a/

James Clyburn says original Confederate flag compromise was to move it out of public view
","The Confederate flag has returned as a flashpoint in South Carolina politics. While the flags of the United States and the state itself hang at half-staff over the state capitol in honor of the nine victims at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, the Confederate battle flag on the statehouse grounds remains at full-mast. As part of a 2000 law, it remains on statehouse grounds. That law itself was the result of protests and an economic boycott aimed at getting the Confederate flag off of the capitol dome. Over 46,000 people marched in Columbia, and the South Carolina Chamber of Commerce lobbied lawmakers to remove the flag. In what was billed as a compromise, the symbol of the South’s battle against the Union ended up alongside a monument to Confederate soldiers located in front of the statehouse. Rep. James Clyburn, D-S.C., said that law and that placement effectively betrayed an earlier deal. ""The compromise was to put that flag in front of the Wade Hampton office building next to the Wade Hampton statue,"" Clyburn said on NBC’s Meet the Press on June 21, 2015. ""What happened was when some people rejected the compromise, the Legislature, out of defiance, put that flag where it is today in front of the statehouse. That is not what the compromise was. The compromise was to put it on the back side of the statehouse, out of public view so it would not have any appearance of sovereignty."" We decided to see if the bill that passed in 2000 undermined a package that had emerged from previous negotiations. To get started, it helps to get a feel for where things are on the statehouse grounds in Columbia. Here’s a map of the statehouse area. From this, Clyburn’s characterization of his preferred location seems pretty accurate. The next question is, did that spot represent a consensus plan? Several ideas in play We reached out to Clyburn’s office and did not hear back by the time we published. However, we did talk to Rep. Gilda Cobb-Hunter, the South Carolina House Democratic minority leader in 2000. Cobb-Hunter remembers the plan Clyburn had in mind, but she also remembers that there were several ideas on the table. ""There were a number of conversations back in 2000 held by a number of different people,"" Cobb-Hunter said. ""It would not be accurate to say that there was one plan that had reached a consensus."" Cobb-Hunter and a top House Republican lawmaker had co-sponsored a proposal for a new installation on the statehouse grounds that they called the Circle of Flags, in which the Confederate flag would have been one of several from South Carolina’s history. Another approach suggested the flag move to the state’s Confederate Relic and Military History Museum. The plan to place it by the Wade Hampton statue (Hampton was a Confederate Civil War general who served as governor and U.S. senator in the 1870s and 1880s) did have significant support. In February 2000, then-governor Democrat Jim Hodges got behind the move, and at the time, Cobb-Hunter said it was a viable option. But it never caught on, not with House Republicans, nor with the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP). Angela Ledford co-authored a study on the flag controversy while getting her doctorate at the University of South Carolina. Now a political scientist at the College of St. Rose, Ledford remembers that plan as ""an informal agreement with some of the legislative leadership."" The compromise that emerged -- first in the state Senate and then affirmed in the House -- sent the flag to its present location by the monument to the Confederate Soldier. In a bit of legislative log-rolling, the Senate passed the bill after the House approved making Martin Luther King, Jr. Day a state holiday. South Carolina was the last state in the country to officially recognize MLK Day. The majority of African-American House members voted against the bill, and the NAACP opposed it as well. Our ruling Clyburn said that there was a compromise measure to place the Confederate flag in a more discreet location on the South Carolina state house grounds. Such a proposal did exist and had the backing of the governor and black lawmakers. But it was not the only compromise plan in play and it failed along with other proposals backed by black lawmakers. Clyburn’s claim leaves out that context. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097198600>],/factchecks/2015/jun/21/james-clyburn/james-clyburn-says-original-confederate-flag-compr/

Flying Confederate battle flag in South Carolina at half-staff requires supermajority vote
","The massacre of nine African-Americans at a Charleston, S.C., church June 17 has renewed calls to remove a Confederate battle flag flying at the South Carolina statehouse. The NAACP, which has long requested the flag’s removal from a monument to Confederate soldiers at the statehouse in Columbia, reiterated its call this week, joined by countless politicians and almost 400,000 petitioners. Hundreds marched June 21 in South Carolina cities to protest the flag remaining unfurled on government property. One of the oddities is that while the U.S. and South Carolina flags are flying at half-staff, the Confederate flag remains at full-staff. CNN reporter Jean Casarez explained the situation to viewers on June 21. ""By law, it must fly at a height of 30 feet,"" she said. ""Any changes — taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done — must be passed by a supermajority of the General Assembly."" We’ve seen many versions of this claim, so we wanted to give it a closer look. South Carolina’s Code of Laws allows the governor to order the lowering of the state and U.S. flags flying atop the capitol building to half-staff, which Gov. Nikki Haley has done. But according to her spokesperson, it’s the Legislature, not the governor, who has the legal authority to alter the Confederate flag. Title 1 Chapter 10 of state law spells it out: ""The flag authorized to be flown at a designated location on the grounds of the Capitol Complex is the South Carolina Infantry Battle Flag of the Confederate States of America. This flag must be flown on a flagpole located at a point on the south side of the Confederate Soldier Monument, centered on the monument, 10 feet from the base of the monument at a height of 30 feet."" ""The provisions of this section may only be amended or repealed upon passage of an act which has received a two-thirds vote on the third reading of the bill in each branch of the General Assembly."" The two-thirds vote applies to both permanent changes and temporary adjustments alike, according to the Democratic State Rep. James E. Smith, who doubts the law’s constitutionality and who’s been working on removing the flag since it was first moved to the grounds. The Confederate flag has been displayed at its current location since 2000, when the state passed the Heritage Act, a compromise that removed the flag from its place of sovereignty atop the capitol but allowed it to remain on the grounds. (The same piece of legislation also requires a two-third's vote by the General Assembly to make changes to Civil Rights monuments.) While the flag can be lowered physically, no one we spoke to could recall a time -- be it Memorial Day or 9/11 -- when it wasn’t flying at full-staff. ""It’s not a flag of sovereignty, it’s a veterans’ battle flag. … Should that flag be on the dome, which it should, it would be lowered, but it’s not,"" said Thomas Leland Summers, commander of the South Carolina division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, who noted that the Confederate flag wasn’t lowered to honor Civil War anniversaries. Smith, a Democratic state lawmaker, agreed, but also said: ""That’s beside the point. It shouldn’t be flying anyway. If we were to lower it, it would give it the status of a sovereign flag, a status greater than it deserves. It should just be furled."" Republican State Rep. Norman ""Doug"" Brannon told MSNBC on June 19 that he plans to sponsor a bill to remove the flag in the next legislative session. Most likely, Brannon won’t be the only one, said Statehouse Report editor and publisher Andy Brack. (Smith says he wants to do better than supermajority, he’d like a unanimous vote.) ""These deaths — especially of one of their own (Democratic State Sen. Clementa Pinckney) — might be the best chance in a decade to get the flag out of a place of prominence,"" Brack said. ""If the issue becomes a hot-button issue — so hot that legislators fear they'll lose their seats or face a challenger in the primaries for doing nothing — they could move promptly. They moved with the legislative equivalent of light speed after the death of Walter Scott in April and by June passed a bill to help pay for body cameras for police."" ""The atmosphere is changing it appears,"" said Don Gordon, political science professor at Furman University in Greenville. ""The attempts to remove the flag from visibility off Gervais Street in front of the Capital may gain traction. The pictures on the shooter's Last Rhodesian website and the clearly racist message some feel have moved the flag from a symbol of heritage to one of blatant hate, a shifting symbolism."" Our ruling A CNN reporter said, ""By law, (the Confederate flag at the South Carolina Capitol) must fly at a height of 30 feet. Any changes -- taken down, or even at half-staff, if that can be done -- must be passed by a supermajority of the general assembly."" In 2000, South Carolina passed legislation that mandated the flag’s location, a height of 30 feet, and a supermajority vote to make any changes. The Confederate flag has never been removed or, to our knowledge, lowered since it was raised on the Confederate Soldiers’ Monument on the capitol grounds. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097392600>],/factchecks/2015/jun/21/jean-casarez/flying-confederate-battle-flag-south-carolina-half/
"['Rhode Island', 'Climate Change', 'Congress', 'Sheldon Whitehouse']","
Sen. Whitehouse gets it right: CO2 in air at historic levels
","Sheldon Whitehouse gave his 100th speech on climate change on the floor of the U.S. Senate on May 18, 2015. Over the past three years, the senator has served up several climate claims worth checking during his running series ""Time to wake up."" So we examined his 100th installment and noticed this statement: ""This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years."" Scientists, who see climate change as Whitehouse does, say the concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2)  in the earth’s atmosphere is increasing due, in large part, to the burning of fossil fuels. And they say rising CO2 levels are an indicator that humans are degrading the health of the planet. We went looking for evidence and quickly found a report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration  that seemed right on target. On May 6, NOAA announced that the monthly global average of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere had exceeded 400 parts per million — for the first time since it had been compiling the data in 1979. This seemed to leave only the ""human history"" part of Whitehouse’s claim in question. But when Whitehouse addressed the issue May 18, he did not specify his source. And, confusingly, he spoke of a ""monthly average"" not a ""monthly global average,"" the term used by NOAA. The distinction is relevant: While the NOAA monthly global average had never exceeded 400 over a period of more than 35 years, the agency’s scientists had previously measured monthly average carbon dioxide levels exceeding 400 ppm in several single locations. In 2012, for example, the ""monthly average"" at the NOAA observatory in Barrow, Alaska, exceeded 400 ppm for the first time. Then the agency’s observatory in Mauna Loa, Hawaii, reported that its ""monthly average"" CO2 level had exceeded 400 parts per million in April 2014. These earlier records, which were reported extensively, were based on observations from single locations while the NOAA monthly global average is based on data from 40 different sites. So Whitehouse seems to have been off a bit with his description of the monthly CO2 data. But what about human history? The senator’s spokesman, Seth Larson, referred us to ice-core data from Antarctica.   Scientists take core samples in Greenland and Antarctica and study the CO2 level of air bubbles — some of which have been trapped in the ice for hundreds of thousands of years. Data from Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, which serves as the primary climate-change data hub of the U.S Department of Energy, show carbon dioxide concentrations ranging between 170 and 300 parts per million ""over the last 800,000 years."" That  more than covers Whitehouse’s in-human-history claim as humans have only been around for about 200,000, according to the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. Before we closed the book on this one, we contacted Anthony Watts, an often-quoted global-warming skeptic. Watts claimed Whitehouse was wrong and cited the individual monthly data and a 2005 article in Nature that he said challenged the senator’s statement. We tracked down the lead author of the Nature, Swedish scientist Anders Moberg, and asked him about the Watts challenge. Impossible, Moberg  said, explaining that his study was about temperatures in 1100 AD to 1150 AD — not carbon dioxide. For CO2 data, Moberg and John King, an oceanography professor at URI, pointed us to the ice-core research, the same data cited by Whitehouse’s office. The ice core records ""would support the Senator's statement,"" said King. ""The highest natural levels are around 300 ppm."" Our ruling In his 100th speech on global warming on May 18, Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse said: ""This March, for the first time in human history, the monthly average carbon dioxide in our atmosphere exceeded 400 parts per million. The range had been 170-300 parts per million for hundreds of thousands of years."" He probably could have been more precise if he had used the phrase ""global average,"" because there have been times when the monthly average exceed 400 parts per million at observation sites in Alaska and Hawaii. Beyond that small point, Whitehouse and his staff were on solid ground.  For that reason, we rate his statement True.

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Rick Perry says Texas has second-best high school graduation rate, No. 1 rate for minorities
","America, Rick Perry trumpeted, be like Texas. Declaring his candidacy for president, the former 10-year governor saluted job gains on his watch, then turned to public education. ""Texas now has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country,"" Perry said. ""And it has the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics."" Most everyone likes rankings. We wondered about these because in February 2013, we rated Mostly True a Perry claim that the state’s high school graduation rates were the nation’s third-highest. In 2011, Texas tied with five states with the No. 3 graduation rate of 86 percent. Unsaid by Perry: Three states had higher rates. So Texas could best have been described as fourth-ranked. Also, by another gauge — comparing graduates to the number of students in ninth grade three years earlier — Texas remained among middling states for 2009-10, with a 79 percent completion rate. Perry’s backup information To our inquiry about Perry’s latest claim, his campaign spokesman, Travis Considine, guided us to a U.S. Department of Education web page presenting graduation rates for the states, plus a chart showing such rates by race/ethnicity. By email, Considine said that in 2012-13, the Texas high school graduation rate of 88 percent ranked second nationally. The same year, according to the federal information, Texas graduation rates for Hispanic and black students exceeded the rates in any other state. Government: Graduation rate placed Texas third for 2012-13 We took his cue, finding the government’s January 2015 chart indicating the state’s 2012-13 graduation rate of 88 percent tied Texas for second nationally with Nebraska, New Jersey, North Dakota and Wisconsin. Iowa led with a 90 percent rate. According to a note under the National Center for Education Statistics chart, the government’s four-year ""adjusted cohort graduation rate"" was based on the ""number of students who graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the adjusted cohort for the graduating class."" That is, according to the note, the size of the potential graduating class was adjusted starting the first year of high school by adding students who  subsequently transferred in and subtracting students who transferred out, moved to another country or who died as reported by each state. On this front, we also checked with the Texas Education Agency. Spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised by email that a follow-up federal chart, dated February 2015, presented each state’s graduation rate as a three-digit figure, including tenths of a percentage point. This added detail resulted in Texas landing third nationally, still tied with Wisconsin. TEA said in a March 2015 press release: ""The Texas graduation rate hit 88.0 percent for the second consecutive year, tying Wisconsin for the nation’s third highest. Only Iowa at 89.7 percent and Nebraska at 88.5 percent posted higher graduation rates for the Class of 2013."" To see if there was another way to shake these figures, we rounded each of the rates in the chart to two digits. Nope: Texas still placed third, tied with Wisconsin, North Dakota and New Jersey. Government: Texas No. 1 in graduation of Hispanic, black students The same chart bore out Perry’s claim about Texas having the highest graduation rates for Hispanic and African American students. The 85.1 percent Texas Hispanic graduation rate in 2012-13 was higher than such rate for other states, edging the 82.5 percent rates for Hispanic students in Indiana and the 82 percent rate for such students in Arkansas. Likewise, according to the chart, Texas ranked No. 1 that year for its black graduation rate, 84.1 percent, besting No. 2 New Hampshire, which had an 82 percent rate, and North Dakota, with an 80 percent rate. Another gauge puts Texas in middle of pack From past fact checks, we recognize another method often used to gauge graduation successes. In this vein, we rated as True a 2010 claim by Democratic gubernatorial candidate Bill White that Texas then ranked 43rd nationally for its 61.3 percent graduation rate in 2008-09. That conclusion was based on comparing the year’s number of graduates to the number of ninth-graders four years earlier, an indicator often called ""attrition."" The intent is to get a snapshot of how many students graduate in four years. In 2011-12, the latest year of available data, Texas had an 82 percent ""averaged freshman graduation rate,"" according to a center chart, putting it in a tie with four states. Twenty-one states had better rates; Vermont and Nebraska ranked first with 93 percent rates. To our inquiry, Julian Vasquez Heilig, a professor at California State University Sacramento who has been critical of how Texas achieves its reported graduation rates, urged us to put stock in the attrition indicator because, he said, it shows the substantial dropoffs in student enrollment between ninth grade and the end of 12th grade. The latest Texas example: In 2010-11, according to the TEA, 390,665 students were in ninth grade. Three years later, the agency says, there were 308,851 12th-graders, a 21 percent difference. That same year, 2013-14, 303,109 students graduated, the agency says. That graduating class, by our calculation, was 78 percent the size of the ninth-grade class three years before. By email, Heilig suggested such enrollment drop-offs suggest a soft spot in the calculation of the graduation rates that place Texas among the nation’s best performers. He said that’s probably because the rates are rooted in each school district reporting the progress of each student, making it at least possible for administrators to record dropouts as students who left for legitimate reasons — such as moving to another state. In May 2014, Heilig laid out his own look at how Texas schools apply student ""leaver"" codes here. A TEA spokeswoman expressed confidence in how Texas tracks students. Lauren Callahan said by email that if a district’s reported reasons for students leaving school look suspicious, it can trigger a state review. ""Is some leaver information ultimately inaccurate?"" Callahan said. ""Yes, but it is usually not because someone is intentionally lying. People just change their minds. At the time a student withdrew from public school, the parent signed a document saying the child was being transferred to a private school, for example. Ultimately something happens and the child never enrolls anywhere."" Our ruling Perry said: ""Texas now has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country. And it has the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics."" Almost: In 2012-13, per federal statistics, Texas ranked No. 3 in overall graduation rates and No. 1 for its African American and Hispanic rates. Then again, comparing graduates to the number of ninth graders enrolled three years earlier, Texas in 2011-12 had an 82 percent ""averaged freshman graduation rate,"" tying with four states and trailing 21 states.

Scott Walker changes marker on when he'll announce 2016 plans
","For months, Gov. Scott Walker has said enacting a new state budget is so important that he would not announce whether he will run for president until one is in place. Along the way, Walker has expressed confidence -- with fellow Republicans in control of both chambers of the Legislature -- that the two-year budget will be adopted by June 30, 2015. That’s the end of the state’s fiscal year, though if lawmakers miss the deadline, spending simply continues at current levels. Unlike the federal government, there is no shutdown. But in recent days, GOP lawmakers have struggled to reach agreement over transportation funding, a proposed new arena for the Milwaukee Bucks and other matters -- putting the June 30, 2015 deadline in jeopardy. Walker, meanwhile, is eyeing July 13, 2015 as a potential presidential announcement date, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel has reported. And now Walker is saying his marking point is -- and has long been -- the end of the fiscal year, not the date work on the budget is completed. What gives? Time to roll out the Flip-O-Meter, which tests whether a politician has changed position on an issue. Our requisite reminder: It does not measure whether any change is good or bad policy or politics, only whether the candidate has been consistent.  A recent chronology of Walker’s statements on the budget and a presidential announcement show he has repeatedly said any presidential announcement would only come after work on the budget is completed -- that is, the Legislature approves a budget and he signs it: April 22, 2015: Walker says while visiting a business in Grand Chute, Wis.: ""I won't make any decision until after the budget's complete."" May 7, 2015: The Associated Press reports Walker said he would make no announcement ""of any kind"" about running for president until after the state budget is signed. May 17, 2015: Walker says on CBS’ ""Face the Nation"" he’ll announce whether he’s formally jumping into the race after he completes work on the state budget. May 30, 2015: Campaigning in New Hampshire, Walker says: ""For us, we have yet to make an announcement. We’ll do that after our budget is done, at the end of June."" June 3, 2015: Walker tells ""Fox & Friends"" about a 2016 presidential bid: ""I haven't made an announcement yet and won't until after the budget's done at the end of this month."" Contrast that with what Walker told reporters June 18, 2015 in Ripon, Wis. When asked about his 2016 announcement plans, Walker told reporters: ""For us, my goal has always been to get through the end of the budget year which ends June 30th. We'll see after that. Sometime in July is a pretty good time."" That’s a change -- something immediately picked up on in the media. When we asked Walker campaign spokeswoman AshLee Strong about the change in Walker’s statements, she said by email: ""As the governor has said, he is optimistic an agreement will be reached in the coming weeks. When we have a public announcement, we will let you know."" Our rating Walker has repeatedly said he would not make an announcement on whether he’ll run for president until after work is complete on the 2015-’17 state budget -- with his hope being that the budget would be in place by June 30, 2015, the end of the state’s fiscal year. Now with that deadline in jeopardy, Walker is changing what he said. He claims he always wanted to merely get past the June 30, 2015 deadline before announcing his plans for 2016. In other words, Walker no longer is saying a budget has to be in place before he’ll make his announcement. For that reversal of position, we give Walker a Full Flop.  To comment on this item, go to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel’s web page.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DB1080>],/factchecks/2015/jun/19/scott-walker/scott-walker-changes-marker-when-hell-announce-201/
"['Military', 'States', 'Texas', 'Doonesbury']","
Doonesbury says Greg Abbott activated Texas State Guard in case of federal martial law and more
","Doonesbury, the long-running lefty comic strip, poked at Texas Gov. Greg Abbott in a June 2015 installment presenting Mike Doonesbury and a buddy chatting about Texas and the federal military exercise that led Abbott to alert the Texas State Guard. In the strip published June 14, 2015, buddy Bernie says: ""I wonder how they’re making out with Jade Helm 15 in Texas."" ""What’s Jade Helm 15?"" Doonesbury replies.   ""A military exercise,"" Bernie replies. ""It’s routine, but Gov. Abbott activated the State Guard to monitor it… in case the troops try to impose martial law, disarm innocent Texans, and detain them in tunnels beneath closed Walmart stores.""   Of course, Doonesbury is satirical. Still, we wondered if the strip accurately recapped Abbott’s actions and motives.   Overview: Jade Helm 15   U.S. military officials have described the Jade Helm 15 operations running from July 2015 into September 2015 as a long-planned exercise occurring throughout the Southwest—including parts of Bastrop County near Austin—to include special forces units from multiple armed services, such as Army Green Berets and Navy SEALs.   The Army’s Special Operations Command said in an April 2015 press release: ""The public can expect nothing much different from their day-to-day activities since much of exercise will be conducted in remote areas. The most noticeable effect the exercise may have on the local communities is an increase in vehicle and military air traffic and its associated noise. There will also be economic gain: an increase in the local economy, in fuel and food purchases and hotel lodging.""   Still, some eyebrows squinched in reaction to a map for the exercise that came public labeling Texas, Utah and California as ""hostile"" for training purposes. In April 2015, an Army representative faced numerous hostile questions at a Central Texas meeting. Over two hours, Bastrop-area residents made it clear to Lt. Col. Mark Lastoria of the U.S. Army they had qualms about the exercise being a way for federal forces to take over Texas and much of the Southwest.   Lastoria was told he couldn’t be trusted and was asked whether Jade Helm 15 would involve bringing foreign fighters from the Islamic State to Texas, whether U.S. troops would confiscate guns and whether the Army intended to implement martial law. Lastoria’s answer for all three was no.   The day after that meeting, Abbott announced he’d told the all-volunteer Texas State Guard to monitor the exercise, though aides said he was not buying into conspiracy theories. Amelia Chasse, an Abbott spokeswoman, was quoted in the Houston Chronicle saying Abbott ""deeply trusts and respects the United States military.""   Doonesbury’s basis   By email, Garry Trudeau, the award-winning creator and author of Doonesbury, told us he based Bernie’s statement on Abbott’s directive to the Guard commander that it monitor the exercise ""to address concerns of Texas citizens."" Trudeau said: ""Those ‘concerns,’ expressed in town meetings with the Army, came in the form of highly entertaining conspiracy theories. I included my favorite, although it’s possible the Governor’s actions were prompted by an even nuttier one.""   ""I make no claim as to when or if Guardsmen will report for duty,"" Trudeau further said, ""just that Abbott directed the Guard to be activated for monitor duties, per his letter.""   Abbott’s letter   Abbott indeed wrote a letter, dated April 28, 2015, telling the Guard commander, Major General Gerald ""Jake"" Betty, to keep an eye on the Jade Helm 15 exercise. That day, Abbott’s office released the letter with a press release stating the governor had delivered the same guidance to Betty in person.   Abbott’s letter did not say the Guard was being activated or deployed. It did say:   ""To address concerns of Texas citizens and to ensure that Texas communities remain safe, secure and informed about military procedures occurring in their vicinity, I am directing the Texas State Guard to monitor Jade Helm 15.   ""During the Operation’s eight-week training period… I expect to receive regular updates on the progress and safety of the Operation.   ""During the training operation, it is important that Texans know their safety, constitutional rights, private property rights and civil liberties will not be infringed. By monitoring the Operation on a continual basis, the State Guard will facilitate communications between my office and the commanders of the Operation to ensure that adequate measures are in place to protect Texans.""   Noting U.S. military officials had assured Texas that locations chosen for the exercise would pose no risk to residents or property, Abbott added: ""Directing the State Guard to monitor the Operation will allow Texas to be informed of the details of military personnel movements and training exercise schedules, and it will give us the ability to quickly and effectively communicate with local communities, law enforcement, public safety personnel and citizens.""   His letter closed by stating ""the action I take today"" comes with support and respect for the nation’s troops. ""I remain certain,"" Abbott wrote, ""that our military members will keep America the freest and strongest nation the world has ever known.""   Six days later, Abbott told reporters ""someone has to be in charge with gathering and disseminating information,"" the Associated Press reported. ""We stepped in to play that role, which is a role to be applauded,"" Abbott said. Asked whether addressing the issue legitimized fringe theories, Abbott said no. He said he was responding to citizen questions, which he said the government has an obligation to answer. ""I've seen nothing that would cause anybody to worry about what's going on,"" Abbott said.   Wondering if Abbott’s directive added up to activating the Guard, we left phone messages for Abbott’s press aides and didn’t hear back. Our separate request for an interview with the appropriate Guard official was declined. But the Guard said in an email not attributed to a person: ""The directive from the Governor is designed to expedite his communication with USASOC as well as city and county officials by utilizing Major General Betty and the Texas State Guard as his designated representative for this exercise. They understand military operations as well as what details are important to communicate locally in Texas communities.""   Another Guard email to us indicated its approximately 2,200 troops were not activated in connection with monitoring the exercise: ""The Texas State Guard has been called to State Active Duty three times this year,"" the Guard said, to respond to floods and to support the Texas Department of Public Safety’s Operation Strong Safety near the Texas-Mexico border.   On the whole, we didn’t find independent signs of Abbott having concerns about martial law, guns getting taken or underground detentions. Also, before Abbott wrote the commander, his office tried to reassure scores of people calling and writing about the federal plans, the San Antonio Express-News later wrote. Constituents received an email and letter signed by Dede Keith, deputy director of Abbott’s communications division, stating: ""Rest assured, this is not a martial law exercise.""   Trudeau stands by claim   Trudeau, in a follow-up reply, said he assumed that by telling the Guard to monitor the exercise, Abbott put in motion an activation of troops to occur once the exercise begins. ""While the governor didn't specify which ‘concerns’ he was addressing, his letter was issued in the context of a contemporaneous, well-publicized swirl of conspiracy theories,"" Trudeau wrote. ""What other concerns could he have been talking about?""   Our ruling   Bernie, a Doonesbury character, said Abbott ""activated the state guard to monitor"" Jade Helm 15 ""in case the troops try to impose martial law, disarm innocent Texans, and detain them in tunnels beneath closed Walmart stores.""   Abbott told the Guard to monitor the exercise though far as we can tell, no troops were dispatched or activated. It’s also worth noting Abbott has said Texans’ safety and rights were not threatened by the federal maneuvers.   On balance, we rate Bernie’s statement Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Ron Johnson is against all government-assisted student loans, U.S. Senate rival Russ Feingold says
","One of the first shots Democrat Russ Feingold took at Republican U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, after announcing he would try to retake his old U.S. Senate seat, was over student loans. ""Just because (college) costs keep going up, that doesn’t mean we can allow the four-year degree to become the sole province of the rich,"" Feingold said June 5, 2015 at the Wisconsin Democratic Convention in Milwaukee. ""My opponent is opposed to all government-assisted student loans."" Is he? Feingold’s evidence To be sure, Johnson has been critical of the government’s role in student loans. In May 2014, he said kids from affluent families are ""taking advantage of all these student loan programs and grants,"" while many middle-class families with no connection to college are picking up the tab -- a claim we rated Mostly False. But Feingold’s claim is absolute -- that Johnson opposes all government-assisted student loans. A Feingold spokesman referred us to Max Croes, a researcher for the Wisconsin Democratic Party. He cited three statements that go beyond Johnson criticizing the loan program. ""Should never have gotten involved"" At a May 2015 town hall meeting in Oconto, Johnson said:   ""I think we’ve done a huge disservice to our young people by enticing them into getting into debt. And, of course, college and universities, they’ve loved it. It helped fill their programs, it helped fill their campuses. It helped them build all kinds of beautiful campus buildings."" After an audience member interjected, Johnson added: ""I will say the federal government never should have gotten involved in student loan programs."" ""Shouldn’t be involved"" In a videotaped interview in 2012 with the Daily Cardinal, a University of Wisconsin-Madison student newspaper, Johnson was asked if he supported extending what was then a 3.4 percent interest rate for student loans. (Congress had recently agreed to keep the discounted rate in place for another year on some federal student loans, rather than allowing the rate to double to 6.8 percent.) Johnson replied: ""No. No. Why are we encouraging our young people to get into debt, first of all? Why is the federal government even making money off the loans? Why is the federal government even involved in the student loan program? I have multiple problems with that. ""Again, for all you young people who agree with (former GOP presidential candidate) Ron Paul in terms of the limited constitutional government -- the federal government shouldn’t even be involved in granting student loans."" ""I’d like the government to get out"" At a town hall meeting outside of Madison in May 2014, Johnson blamed the federal government for encouraging college students to take on debt they can’t afford, according to a report from Wisconsin Public Radio.   ""I'd like the federal government, over time, to remove itself from the funding mechanisms of college education,"" he said after the meeting. ""I think it's done a great deal of harm – very unintended negative consequences."" Johnson’s response Johnson’s staff responded to Feingold’s claim by telling us it ""is patently and demonstrably wrong,"" but cited only Johnson’s support of one piece of legislation. In July 2013, Johnson voted for a measure, later signed into law by President Barack Obama, that ties the interest rates on federal student loans to the financial markets. That is, if rates on Treasury notes rise, so would student loan rates.  The upshot was that the law reduced interest rates in the short term, but allows them to rise in future years if market conditions change, although the rates would be capped (at 8.25 percent for undergraduate loans). A New York Times news article noted that many liberals were upset that some Democrats backed the measure, since it eliminated fixed-rate federally subsidized loans. So, Johnson voted for a measure that helped student loan recipients in the short term -- although it took the government out of setting interest rates, creating the likelihood that the rates will rise in future years. Our rating Feingold said Johnson ""is opposed to all government-assisted student loans."" Johnson has said the government never should have gotten involved in student loans, shouldn’t be involved in it and should look to gradually get out of it. But one of his votes helped student borrowers in the short term, though that measure could lead to higher interest rates in future years, since the rates are tied to changes in the financial markets. Feingold’s statement is accurate but needs clarification, our definition of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C150CC0>],/factchecks/2015/jun/19/russ-feingold/ron-johnson-against-all-government-assisted-studen/

Many get HIV diagnosis only after developing AIDS?
","The health departments in Fulton and Dekalb counties are hosting a week of free HIV screenings that ends on National HIV Testing Day, June 27.   The immediate goal of the Test Atlanta campaign, which starts Sunday, is to encourage people from age 13 to 64 to know their HIV status by getting tested, officials with Fulton County Health and Wellness said in a press release on June 16, 2015.   ""Finding out whether you are infected with HIV is the first step to getting connected to life-saving care,"" the release states. "" It’s estimated almost 40 percent of people with HIV are not diagnosed until they have developed AIDS. That can be up to 10 years after they first became infected.""   Those statistics got our attention.   PolitiFact Georgia decided to check further.   We contacted Lyn Vaughn, risk communicator with Fulton County Health and Wellness, to ask the source of those statistics.   She provided with us links to, and excerpts from, two statements, one from the Centers for Disease Control and one she said was from the National Association of People Living with AIDS, the group credited with starting the national testing day.   The report from the CDC, issued in 2010, said nationally, the proportion of patients diagnosed with AIDS at or within 12 months of their HIV diagnosis in 2007 was 32 percent.   We tried to contact officials with the association to ask about the source of their statistics but were unsuccessful. We later learned from the group’s web site that the association filed bankruptcy and closed its doors after 30 years in February 2013.   The CDC, which supported National HIV Testing Day (NHTD) from its founding, continues to promote the annual event and advocate for routine HIV testing.   According to the CDC, more than 1.2 million Americans are living with HIV, and almost one in seven or 14 percent are unaware of their infection. In the past decade, the number of people living with HIV has increased, but the annual number of new HIV infections has remained relatively stable -- at about 50,000 a year, the CDC reports.   So what about that statistic?   Vaughn later sent us additional information, including a recent news report on ongoing HIV testing available to patients who come through the emergency room at Atlanta’s Grady Memorial Hospital.   Not all of the patients agree to be tested. But among those who were diagnosed as HIV infected between July 2013 and February of this year, nearly half had AIDS, according to data we received from Grady.   The physician in charge of Grady’s program said many of the patients in the group that was subject of the report had been HIV positive for several years.   The other data we looked at came from the state Department of Public Health.   In Georgia, 24 percent of all newly diagnosed HIV patients in 2012 already had AIDS, the agency reported. That percentage also held true for 2013 as well, DPH reports show.   We also circled back to the CDC, where the most recent data available is for 2012.   Nationally, also, 24 percent of patients who were initially diagnosed with HIV infection were simultaneously diagnosed with AIDS, the CDC reported in 2012.   Most of those people were likely infected for many years without knowing it, the CDC said.   Our ruling   The press release from Fulton County Health and Wellness promoting the week of testing for HIV states that almost 40 percent of people with the virus are not diagnosed until they already have developed AIDS. And that can be up to 10 years after they first are infected.   That specific statistic reportedly came from a national organization that is no longer in operation and appears high compared to the 24 percent figure reported t by the state and CDC.   But that still supports the health department’s overarching point about the need for early testing and treatment.   For that reason, we rate the statement Mostly True.  ",[<zip object at 0x000002809686F480>],/factchecks/2015/jun/19/fulton-county-health-and-wellness/many-get-hiv-diagnosis-only-after-developing-aids/
