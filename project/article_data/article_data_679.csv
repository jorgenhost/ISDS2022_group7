Retailers overstates the impact of tax holidays
","State lawmakers have struggled this legislative session,  trying to figure out how to raise up to $1 billion a year to fund statewide transportation needs. The House came up with a plan.  But the Senate approved a very different version of House Bill 170, killing more than $200 million in fees associated with the plan. Lawmakers reached a deal late Tuesday that will get close to the original $1 billion goal. The compromise also killed a Senate attempt to elminate Georgia’s tax holidays that nix sales taxes on certain back-to-school and energy efficient items. The president of the Georgia Retail Federation recently wrote an editorial that warned eliminating the popular incentive could curb the state’s economic activity. An association-funded study showed that ""consumers often used the additional savings from their tax-free purchases to buy additional items,"" Rick McAllister wrote in an editorial in the Savannah Morning News. That in turn creates demand for additional workers, he added, either hired as temporary labor or paid through increased overtime. ""We recognize the value these sales tax holidays have in saving families money while also producing needed jobs,"" McAllister wrote. Could it be that those perks exist and wold have been lost in lawmakers’ scramble to find cash for roadwork? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. Luckily, Georgia has a history of years with, and without, the holidays. The state first exempted clothes, school supplies and computers from state and local sales taxes for two weekends in 2002. It added a similar holiday for energy-efficient appliances in 2005. Conventional wisdom held that the breaks were at best a wash for state coffers, while remaining popular among voters. But the state canceled the holidays in 2010, due to worries about revenue declines. McAllister said the association hired the consulting firm, Washington Economic Group, to look at retailers’ books for all of the years to divine the impact. Researchers found that the years with the sales tax holidays showed an increase in all sales, not just on exempted items, for that entire quarter. In the years without the break, sales were generally stagnant or lower. Indeed, the report concluded that sales tax revenue is actually up for governments during holiday years, because of those additional sales. ""There is a stimulus effect in general,"" McAllister said. That runs counter to an annual analysis by the Tax Foundation, a right-leaning nonprofit that examines the tax holidays nationwide by reviewing anecdotal and scholarly reports.  Those findings have never waned: shoppers mostly adjust when they make purchases but rarely buy significantly more or less because of breaks. ""In some states, you will see some element of impulse purchases,"" said Joseph Henchman, the foundation’s vice president of state projects and author of the annual report. ""Generally, it’s just a shift in when people buy things. People don’t typically buy that much more for just 5 or 6 percent off."" In other words, one analysis finds tax holidays prompt shoppers to buy more. A broader study concludes the breaks are ineffective in spurring any significant bump. So which is it? Probably more the latter, said Robert Buschman, a senior research associate at the Fiscal Research Center at Georgia State University. Buschman, an economist, has studied the specifics of the holidays in Georgia. He acknowledged at least one study that found some people do make big-ticket purchases such as computers because of the tax break and sales prices that tend to accompany the holiday. But his 2011 study on the Peach State showed that Georgians behave the way other consumers do during the tax holidays: They buy mostly what they would have bought anyway, just during one weekend. A model that only counts sales in that period would show an increase, the way the association’s report does. But that’s because it assumes there is not an offsetting reduction in another period – which is how most shoppers behave. ""Obviously consumers do go shopping with the sales tax holidays. But if not for the holiday, would they have gone to back-to school sales anyway,"" Buschman asked. ""Most likely they would."" Most studies then, including one specific to Georgia, show that the sales tax holidays do increase sales. But there is not much of an incremental increase over what shoppers would spend anyway, if not for the break. The retail association’s consultants failed to take all of that into consideration. McAllister claimed that the tax holidays spur sales and boost the economy. It’s true that the breaks are popular with shoppers, who do respond to the sales. But the overwhelming evidence is that people are buying what they would need with or without the break.

Does Florida have a Religious Freedom Restoration Act like Indiana's?
","Likely presidential candidates have reacted to Indiana’s controversial Religious Freedom Restoration Act as Gov. Mike Pence, a Republican, has had to defend the law against those who say it discriminates against gays and lesbians. Former Gov. Jeb Bush sided with Pence in a radio interview on Monday. ""I think Gov. Pence has done the right thing,"" Bush said in a radio interview with Hugh Hewitt on March 30. ""Florida has a law like this. Bill Clinton signed a law like this at the federal level. This is simply allowing people of faith space to be able to express their beliefs, to be able to be people of conscience. I just think once the facts are established, people aren’t going to see this as discriminatory at all."" How similar is the Florida law to the Indiana law, or the federal law before that? When we reached out to Bush’s office, they reiterated that Bush was describing the laws as ""very similar."" We decided to delve into the evidence for a complete picture. After federal law struck down, Florida’s law followed Today’s controversy goes back to 1993, when Clinton signed into law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The law’s intent was to protect religious practices from government interference, such as whether a Muslim prison guard could wear a beard, or Native Americans could use peyote as part of the religious practices. In 1997, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the law didn’t apply to states, which kicked off a spree of about 19 states passing their own versions of the law. In 1998, a year before Bush took office, the Florida Legislature passed the Florida Religious Freedom Restoration Act with broad support and little media attention. Both the American Civil Liberties Union and the Christian Coalition backed it. It became law without Democratic Gov. Lawton Chiles signature.  Florida’s law stated, ""the government shall not substantially burden a person’s exercise of religion."" To be clear, it made no mention of same-sex marriage or gay rights. (Neither does the Indiana law.) At the time, state officials seemed most concerned about the protections they would have to provide prisoners. ""We had one prisoner who wanted conjugal visits because he said his religion commanded him to 'go forth and multiply,’ ""' said Marty Moore, deputy general counsel for Florida Attorney General Bob Butterworth, to the Lakeland Ledger. Over the years, churches and ministers have used the law to argue that they shouldn’t be subject to zoning laws or other actions from local government. They haven’t found much success due to ""hostile judicial interpretation,"" said University of Virginia professor Douglas Laycock.   In one case, Temple B’Nai Zion in Sunny Isles Beach -- a city in Miami-Dade County -- used the Florida law to challenge a decision by the city to designate their 1964 building as historic. The temple’s owners said the designation would stifle expansion plans. The lawsuit was dismissed by a Miami federal judge but reinstated by a federal appeals court. In 2014, the temple and the city reached a settlement that kept the historic designation but allowed some expansion. Differences in text and context In 2015, the context for Indiana’s law is different. Courts have been striking down same-sex marriage bans, including in Indiana, and the U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the constitutionality of the bans this year. When Pence signed Indiana’s law in a private ceremony, people who work for groups that oppose same-sex marriage were in attendance. One of the lobbyists, Eric Miller of Advance America, heralded the state’s law as protecting Christian bakers, florists and photographers from penalty ""for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage, among other examples."" In addition to that context, there are differences in the texts of Florida’s 1998 law and Indiana’s recent law. Indiana’s law says the law can be used to protect religious freedom in private disputes, even if the government is not a party. Florida’s law has no such language. Here’s the Indiana text: ""A person whose exercise of religion has been substantially burdened, or is likely to be substantially burdened, by a violation of this chapter may assert the violation or impending violation as a claim or defense in a judicial or administrative proceeding, regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding."" Indiana’s law seems to be written to specifically cover a situation such as the New Mexico photographer who did not want to participate in a same-sex wedding, said Caroline Mala Corbin, a University of Miami constitutional law professor. The New Mexico Supreme Court ruled against the photographer. Indiana’s law follows the Supreme Court case about Hobby Lobby, in which the court ruled that the federal law protects family owned corporations from being forced to offer insurance that covers contraception under the health care law. Under Indiana’s law, a ""person"" is extended to mean ""a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association"" or other entity. ""Unlike the federal and Florida RFRA (Religious Freedom Restoration Act), the Indiana one explicitly covers for-profit corporations,"" Corbin said. ""It’s still an open question as to whether Florida’s RFRA extends to any for-profit corporation."" University of Minnesota law professor Dale Carpenter pointed to two more differences between the laws in Florida and Indiana: • The Florida law specifically excludes claims made under the state's drug abuse prevention and control law (Chapter 893), which means you can’t get a religious exemption to drug laws in Florida. The Indiana law has no such limitation. •  The Florida law requires that a person's religious exercise must be burdened before a claim can be made. The Indiana law says that it need only to be ""likely to be substantially burdened."" Robin Fretwell Wilson, professor and director of the family law and policy program at the University of Illinois College of Law, said Florida and Indiana share something in common: Neither has a statewide ban against LGBT discrimination. Our ruling Speaking of the Indiana law, Bush said that Florida ""has a law like this."" Florida did pass its own version of the 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act. But the laws and the context for their passage are different. Indiana’s law says government doesn’t have to be a party to the case, and it extends protections to corporations, and that’s different from Florida’s law.  Bush's statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details. We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/mar/31/jeb-bush/does-florida-have-religious-freedom-restoration-ac/

Martin O'Malley says U.S. has seen falling wages for 12 straight years
","Assuming she runs, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has assembled a formidable lead in the race for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination. But there’s still a chance she’ll get some competition before the primaries and caucuses start next year. One of those potential candidates is Martin O’Malley, who served two terms as governor of Maryland. O’Malley, like Clinton, hasn’t officially announced a bid yet, but he recently traveled to New Hampshire, home of the first-in-the-nation primary, and he sat for an interview with George Stephanopoulos on ABC’s This Week. During the interview, O’Malley decried the long-term economic fraying of the American dream, saying the United States has had ""12 years in a row of wages declining."" A reader suggested we check out this claim, so we did. We turned to data from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, zeroing in on the annual averages for median, inflation-adjusted, usual, weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers. That sounds like a mouthful -- but when we ran it by two economists, Tara Sinclair of George Washington University and Gary Burtless of the Brookings Institution, both said it was the same metric they would have used. Here’s a summary of the data between 2002 and 2014:   Year Median, inflation-adjusted, usual, weekly earnings for full-time wage and salary workers (annual average) Change from previous year 2002 $ 338 -- 2003 337 $ -1 2004 338 +1 2005 333 -5 2006 333 0 2007 335 +2 2008 335 0 2009 345 +10 2010 342 -3 2011 336 -6 2012 335 -1 2013 333 -2 2014 334 +1 Whole period (2002-2014) -- -4   Here’s where O’Malley has a point: Wages were indeed lower in 2014 than they were 12 years earlier. But here’s where his phrasing is misleading: It’s not accurate to say the United States has had ""12 years in a row of wages declining."" This makes it sound like wages dropped, in lockstep, in each of those 12 years. That’s not the case -- as the chart above shows, wages fell in six of the 12 years, rose in four years, and remained steady in two years. Indeed, over the 12-year period in question, weekly earnings remained in a fairly narrow band -- sometimes rising, sometimes falling, but only deviating by $4 a week over 12 years, a decline of just over 1 percent from where they started in 2002. That’s more accurately described as a sideways trend line than as a steady decline. ""Gov. O’Malley misspoke or simply was in error,"" Burtless said. O’Malley’s office did not dispute the data we found. Spokeswoman Lis Smith said O’Malley has previously used a different formulation -- that ""over the last 12 years, wages have been going down, not up."" He used that phrasing in Iowa recently, for instance. And that wording would have been more accurate than what he said on This Week. Our ruling O’Malley said that in the United States, we’ve had ""12 years in a row of wages declining."" He has a point that, using the most appropriate measure of compensation, weekly wages adjusted for inflation are lower now than they were 12 years ago. But they have not fallen consistently and inexorably, as the phrasing of his claim on This Week suggests.

Barack Obama says health care law has led to 50,000 fewer preventable hospital deaths
","In a recent speech marking the fifth anniversary of the Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama touted a number of accomplishments he credited to the law. ""The work that we’ve been able to do is already spurring the kinds of changes that we had hoped for,"" Obama said. ""It’s helped reduce hospital readmission rates dramatically. It’s a major reason why we’ve seen 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals."" We hadn’t heard the claim about preventable deaths, so we took a closer look. When we asked the White House for its evidence, they pointed us to a report from the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. Prepare yourself for its very wonky title: ""Interim Update on 2013 Annual Hospital-Acquired Condition Rate and Estimates of Cost Savings and Deaths Averted From 2010 to 2013."" The agency is a part of the federal Department of Health and Human Services, and its report takes a preliminary look at a program called Partnership for Patients that was created by the health care law. The program aims to get 3,700 hospitals -- along with physicians, nurses, employers, patients, government officials and others -- to work together to cut preventable hospital-acquired conditions by 40 percent between 2010 and 2014 and to reduce hospital readmissions by 20 percent over the same period. The report found that ""approximately 50,000 fewer patients died in the hospital as a result of the reduction in HACs (hospital-acquired conditions), and approximately $12 billion in health care costs were saved from 2010 to 2013."" This occurred ""during a period of concerted attention by hospitals throughout the country to reduce adverse events,"" the report said. Independent experts said the report is credible. Lucian Leape, an adjunct professor of health policy at Harvard University’s T.H. Chan School of Public Health, told PolitiFact, ""I think these data are reliable, and the ACA (Affordable Care Act) deserves credit."" Leape, who has been studying preventable hospital deaths since the early 1990s, credited improved data collection and the work of Partnership for Patients, ""which has been a serious – and successful – effort to engage hospitals in achieving specific goals, such as reducing infections."" He said it’s the kind of effort he and others called for a decade and a half ago but ""never got before the ACA. Hospitals were improving their safety slowly on their own, and this gave it a big boost. It's the first time we have seen measurable, significant decreases in any of the harms that we cause by treatment failures."" David Nash, dean of the Jefferson School of Population Health in Philadelphia, agreed that the numbers are credible. ""This is in part due to a huge amount of work on the part of hospitals,"" Nash said. We do see two fairly minor caveats. • These numbers are estimates. Obviously, it’s not possible to literally count the number of deaths prevented in the same way you can count actual deaths. So the authors of the report had to use a complicated set of estimating techniques to come up with the 50,000 figure. The authors of the report made a point of including some caveats, including that ""the estimate of deaths averted is less precise than the estimate of the size of the reduction"" in hospital-acquired conditions."" The report also notes ""uncertainty inherent in our statistical extrapolations"" and says that it’s ""clear"" that ""tens of thousands of deaths"" have been averted, which is less specific than the 50,000 figure Obama focused on. • Preventable deaths had already begun falling even before the health care law was enacted. Periodically, the Centers for Disease Control and Protection has analyzed data on inpatient hospital deaths, with its most recent analysis covering data through 2010. That analysis found that the number of inpatient hospital deaths (not just preventable ones) decreased from 776,000 in 2000 to 715,000 in 2010 -- a drop of 61,000 over a decade. In other words, hospital deaths in general were already on a downward slope prior to the health care law’s passage; it’s just accelerated since then. The authors of the report that Obama cited also hedged a bit on the causes for the decline, writing that ""the precise causes of the decline in patient harm are not fully understood."" Our ruling Obama said the Affordable Care Act is ""a major reason why we’ve seen 50,000 fewer preventable patient deaths in hospitals."" Independent experts said the report Obama was using as evidence represents a credible attempt to quantify recent improvements in preventing hospital-patient deaths, even if the numbers are estimates rather than hard figures. They added that it’s reasonable to credit the health care law’s Partnership for Patients program with accelerating the gains, even if the improvements were already under way at the time the law was passed.

In its 'Race Together' campaign, Starbucks says white people hold nearly 90% of the nation's wealth
","Soon after unveiling its ""Race Together"" campaign -- which seemed to get more bad publicity than good, initially -- Starbucks published an insert in 2 million copies of USA Today to explain why it wanted to start a national conversation about one of the nation’s most sensitive topics. The eight-page insert, which appeared March 20, 2015, included a series of statements about race. One of them was: ""White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth."" That number is striking because only 67 percent of households are white, and reports have indicated the U.S. population is shifting toward minority-majority status. With Starbucks chief executive officer Howard Schultz expected in Milwaukee on April 1, 2015, we thought we would check the company’s claim. The campaign In addition to its coffee, Starbucks is known for social awareness. In 2015, it placed fifth in Forbes’ annual ranking of the world’s most admired companies. The rankings are based on nine attributes, and one of Starbucks’ top attributes, according to the business magazine, is social responsibility. ""Race Together"" grew out of concerns over police killings of unarmed black men in Ferguson, Mo., and New York. In announcing the campaign, Schultz called it ""an opportunity to begin to re-examine how we can create a more empathetic and inclusive society – one conversation at a time."" Schultz encouraged his baristas to write ""Race Together"" on Starbucks cups and to engage in conversations while serving their customers. That ended after less than a week, which Starbucks said was as planned, after heavy criticism. Other parts of ""Race Together"" are continuing. Starbucks hasn't confirmed it, but the family of Dontre Hamilton said Schultz would be meeting with them in Milwaukee. Hamilton was shot to death by a Milwaukee officer on April 30, 2014, after Starbucks employees called police to report Hamilton sleeping in a downtown park. The officer was fired. Starbucks’ evidence To back its claim about white wealth, Starbucks cited a November 2013 article in the American Prospect, a liberal magazine. The author said he did calculations on net worth data from the 2010 version of the Federal Reserve System’s Survey of Consumer Finances, a respected source. According to the article: Whites held 88.4 percent of the nation’s wealth; Hispanics, 4 percent and blacks 2.7 percent. The remaining 4.9 percent was listed as other. That category includes Native Americans, Asians, Pacific Islanders and those with a multi-racial background. So, that’s a start. But first let’s take a step back. To be clear, wealth -- commonly measured as net worth -- is different than income. It is the difference between a household's assets, such as savings or a home, and liabilities, such as a mortgage or a car loan. So, you can have a good-paying job but have a negative net worth, if your debts outweigh your savings. Some reports in recent years have said as many as one in four households has zero net worth or negative net worth. More recent data  We were able to get the latest and more detailed breakdown on net worth from the Federal Reserve, for 2013. The nation’s net worth was $65.5 trillion and breaks down this way:
  Race/Ethnicity Net worth  Share of net worth White $58.1 trillion 90 percent Black $1.71 trillion 3 percent Hispanic $1.46 trillion 2 percent Other $3.29 trillion 5 percent   As we close, we'll note that two of our most-clicked fact checks were about disparities in wealth: In 2011, activist and filmmaker Michael Moore said in Madison that 400 Americans ""have more wealth than half of all Americans combined."" We rated the claim True. And in 2013, we rated as True this claim by the liberal group One Wisconsin Now: ""The Walton family, which owns Wal-Mart, controls a fortune equal to the wealth of the bottom 42 percent of Americans combined."" Our rating Starbucks said: ""White people control almost 90 percent of the nation's wealth."" That matches the latest net worth figures from the Federal Reserve System.

Delta spokesman mostly correct about jet fuel taxes in Georgia
","Time is running out for the 2015 General Assembly and for state lawmakers who had a lofty goal this session of raising at least $1 billion for transportation improvements. One of the backstories to the transportation bill (House Bill 170) has been: Will a fraction of the money -- about $23 million -- come from eliminating a controversial state jet fuel tax exemption? That tax break has benefitted hometown Delta Air lines for nearly a decade and was made permanent by that lawmakers and the governor in 2012. To some, eliminating the exemption seems reasonable. ""The loophole is unnecessary since Delta is highly profitable and no longer at risk of bankruptcy, as they were a few years ago (when the exemption was first granted),"" said Wesley Tharpe, analyst with the left-leaning Georgia Budget & Policy Institute. ""Ending their special privileges at a time when we’re asking Georgians for more revenues makes sense."" Delta executives don’t feel the same. They’ve called efforts to remove the exemption ""one of the most business-unfriendly moves"" by the General Assembly in recent years. Among Delta’s arguments is that the existing jet fuel taxes are already high enough and that a further increase could jeopardize Atlanta airport’s competitive status.  ""If approved, this measure would put Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport at an economic disadvantage by making aviation fuel taxes in Georgia some of the highest in the industry,"" Trebor Banstetter Delta spokesman told The Associated Press, referencing House Bill 175, a measure that initially would have eliminated the sales tax exemption just for Delta. Banstetter and other Delta officials have cited information from Airlines for America, the airline trade association, that they say backs ups their claim that Georgia already has one of the nation’s highest jet fuel tax rates. PolitiFact Georgia wondered: Could that be right? Buckle up, and let’s see where the facts take us. The right-leaning Tax Foundation ranked states for jet fuel taxes in June 2014 based on data from Airlines for America. The foundation found Georgia was 11th nationally at 15 cents, based on its combined effective jet fuel tax rate and fees per gallon. Illinois had the highest jet fuel taxes at 32.8 cents -- more than twice Georgia’s -- followed by California with 27 cents and Connecticut with 26.4 cents. Three states -- Texas, Ohio and Delaware -- had no jet fuel taxes. Of the 47 states that have some type of jet fuel tax or fee, Georgia is considered an outlier, said Victoria Day, spokeswoman for Airlines for America.  ""Most states do not apply a retail sales tax to jet fuel, which makes sense because taxing business inputs creates tax pyramiding,"" Day said.  Georgia’s jet fuel sales tax would go from three percent to four percent, if the exemption is eliminated. To show how complicated the jet fuel tax computations are: 19 states don’t include any jet fuel in their sales tax base; 16 states tax private jet fuel purchases but exempt commercial airlines; and 15 states apply the sales tax to commercial jet fuel, although sometimes at a reduced rate. Finally, three states (New Jersey, New York, and Washington) only tax fuel estimated to be burned within their state borders, significantly reducing the burden of fuel taxes, the foundation’s report said. We found another report on jet fuel costs at 12 billion.org, a site run by Unite Here International Union, a group critical of tax exemptions benefitting the airlines.  The report looked at costs at the major airports. It’s data was slightly older than the association’s. It showed fuel costs at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport as sixth highest at 15 cents a gallon and Chicago’s O'Hare International Airport as the highest at 32.75 cents per gallon, numbers identical to those reported by the airline trade association for 2014 for Georgia and Illinois, respectively. Commercial aviation supports more than 350,000 jobs and drives 45 billion in economic activity in Georgia, according to Airlines for America. How the tax break came to be Lawmakers first approved the jet fuel tax break for Delta in 2005, when the airline was headed into Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. They repeatedly extended the tax exemption even as the carrier’s finances improved and its stock soared, making it permanent for Delta and any airlines in 2012. State Rep. Earl Ehrhart, R-Powder Springs introduced House Bill 175 in January, saying it was time Delta ""get off the taxpayer dime."" He said the bill was retaliation against Delta officials for speaking out against a potential second airport in Paulding County or suggesting that lawmakers should not be ""chicken"" about raising taxes for transportation. Delta officials said Ehrhart’s bill, as originally drafted, was illegal because federal law requires jet fuel tax revenues be spent on airports or airport improvements, not go to the general fund, a statement PolitiFact Georgia ruled as True. Ehrhart vehemently denied the bill, which stalled in the House, was illegal, saying a three-year grace period from the feds would give the state a chance to reinstate the tax and spent the money as it wants, at least temporarily. Delta’s Banstetter said last week: ""At this point, all we can say is that if the bill is passed it will be up to the FAA to decide whether the state is in compliance."" In at least two other states -- North Carolina and Illinois -- legislators are considering proposals to remove tax breaks or close tax loopholes for airlines. Our conclusion:  Delta officials are arguing against reinstating a 1-percent tax on jet fuel, which would generate about $23 million a year, mostly from Delta fuel purchases. Delta executives say that Georgia already has one of the nation’s highest jet fuel taxes and would have an even higher rate, if the exemption were eliminated.  Georgia’s jet fuel tax is ranked 11th and is less than half of the tax in No. 1 rated Illinois. That bit of missing context takes this one down a notch on the Truth-O-Meter.

Ted Cruz says today, roughly half of born-again Christians aren't voting
","Declaring for president, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz told a crowd at Liberty University, the Virginia institution founded by evangelist Jerry Falwell: ""Today roughly half of born-again Christians aren’t voting. They’re staying home. Imagine instead millions of people of faith all across America coming out to the polls and voting our values."" At least since Ronald Reagan won the presidency, Republicans have viewed conservative Christians--specifically white evangelical Christians--as pivotal. And in the latest presidential race, in 2012, born-again Christians comprised 26 percent of all voters, most of them saying they voted for GOP nominee Mitt Romney, according to exit polls commissioned by news organizations. By phone and email, Robert P. Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute told us white evangelical Christians vote in equal or larger proportions than other Americans. Still, he said, the share of white Christian voters has declined. In 1992, he said, 75 percent of voters identified that way while in 2012, 57 percent did so. Key factors are increasing ethnic diversity and fewer young Americans affiliating with a religion, Jones said. He noted a fall 2014 institute study breaking down the religious denominations of Americans. So, could it be that that these days, about half of born-again Christians aren’t voting? Political scientists we reached wondered if Cruz was solely talking about voters in presidential elections--seems logical--and if he really meant to emphasize only white evangelical Protestants rather than all born-agains. That seems likely since many African Americans, who tend to vote Democratic, identify as born-again Christians, which loosely refers to individuals who have made or renewed a commitment to Jesus Christ as their personal savior. Cruz’s backup We didn’t hear back from Cruz about his claim until we initially published this fact check. As we’ll detail, available voter surveys suggested born-again Christian turnouts of 58 percent to 63 percent in the 2012 elections--meaning 42 percent of such voters or fewer stayed home. By email, Cruz campaign spokesman Rick Tyler said Cruz reached his ""roughly half"" conclusion starting from a 2007 survey by the non-partisan Pew Research Center indicating 26.3 percent of American adults identified as evangelical Protestants. The center conducted a ""nationally representative sample of 35,556 adults living in continental United States telephone households"" from May 8, 2007 to Aug. 13, 2007. Apply that result to the U.S. Census Bureau’s estimate of adults who were eligible to vote in 2012, 215 million, Tyler wrote, and it looks like nearly 57 million of citizens eligible to vote in 2012 belonged to evangelical Protestant churches. Separately, he pointed out, Pew cited voter exit polls taken for news organizations to conclude 23 percent of the nation’s November 2012 voters were white evangelical Protestants. Given that 129 million voters participated that fall, Tyler said, that means there were about 30 million evangelical Protestant voters, which would have been about half of the evangelical Protestants eligible to vote. Next, we asked political scientists who had already weighed in on Cruz’s claim to assess Cruz’s methodology. Most said Cruz inappropriately mixed apples and oranges by applying the 2007 survey results to 2012 voter exit polls though a University of Texas professor, Daron Shaw, said, ""I don’t know that the Cruz numbers are any less plausible"" than estimates we’d earlier tracked down. We also reached out to Pew researcher Gregory Smith, who declined to comment on Cruz’s methodology though he cautioned generally against reaching any conclusions by relying on different surveys asking different questions taken in different years. Smith said, though, it looks like white evangelical Protestants comprised about as much of the electorate in 2012--23 percent, according to voter exit polls--as they did of the population (19 percent, according to Pew surveys taken in 2012). Smith’s nudge: Given that 54 percent of eligible Americans voted for president in 2012, according to the U.S. Election Project overseen by Michael McDonald of the University of Florida, Smith said, it’s not implausible that about half of white born-again Christians didn’t vote. ""Half of everybody didn’t vote,"" Smith said. Earlier, we looked for independent analyses of born-again turnout. American National Election Studies Experts told us a good way to gauge turnout among born-again Christians is a national project that has surveyed people about voting every presidential election year since 1952. Next, Patricia Luevano of the American National Election Studies, overseen by researchers at the University of Michigan and Stanford University, told us by email that after the 2012 elections, some 83 percent of born-again Christians interviewed in person said they had voted with 78 percent of born-again Christians interviewed online saying so. Gadzooks! Then again, Luevano wrote: ""It should be noted, of course, that this is self-report,"" her point being that individuals sometimes declare they voted even if they didn’t. Don’t run with those figures, Shaw told us, because ""you cannot just put out a self-reported turnout figure without acknowledging that these numbers are significantly inflated."" We didn’t figure out how to accurately shrink those figures. Fortuitously, the national study does so for voters it interviews in person by checking public records, a lead investigator told us by phone. The upshot for 2012, Stanford University’s Simon Jackman said, is that 63 percent of born-again Christians voted. Overall, the survey drew on 2,054 in-person interviews with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.2 percentage points, he said. Some 18 percent of these born-again voters were African American, Jackman said by email. So we pressed Jackman to focus on those voters more likely to vote Republican. He said 68 percent of white born-again Christians voted (again, a conclusion based on checking what people said against voting records). Other analyses We identified a couple of other surveys per turnout by born-again Christians--and noticed an older study indicating half of born-again Christians voting. Stephen Ansolabehere of Harvard University said by email that according to the Cooperative Congressional Election Study, 65 percent of 18,559 born-again Christians said they voted in the 2012 elections. Adjusting for some people saying they voted when they did not, he said, knocks the rate of voting born-again Christians to 58 percent to 59 percent. John C. Green of the University of Akron said its voter surveys indicate 61 percent of born-again Christians voted in 2012. It’s worth noting, he emailed, ""that it takes a lot of effort to mobilize all kinds of voters, including evangelicals. Getting to 61% took a huge effort."" Footnote: A Washington Post news story published after Cruz’s declaration pointed out the University of Akron study covering the 2000 election year. That year, researchers found, 50 percent of white evangelical voters cast ballots--as did half of black Protestants, half of Roman Catholics and 58 percent of mainline Protestants. Our ruling Cruz said: ""Today roughly half of born-again Christians aren’t voting."" This may have been so in the 2000 presidential election year.  But if we’re talking about voting for president lately,  surveys suggest born-again Christian turnouts of 58 percent to 63 percent in 2012--meaning 42 percent of voters or fewer stayed home.

"['Federal Budget', 'Military', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Defense spending has dropped 21 percent since 2010, Rubio says
","Even with combat in Iraq and Afghanistan officially over, potential presidential hopeful Sen. Marco Rubio is calling for a reversal of a shrinking defense budget. On March 24, 2015, Rubio and Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., introduced a budget amendment that would raise the Pentagon’s budget despite legislative limitations and an end to two wars. The defense budget already has gone down too much, Rubio said in a speech on the Senate floor. ""Inflation-adjusted defense spending has declined 21 percent since 2010, and even if we discount the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan, it has still declined by a dangerous 12 percent,"" Rubio said. Those are big numbers in a military budget that is more than $500 billion. We wanted to check his accounting and see what the numbers told us. Sequestration frustration Rubio’s amendment deals largely with the effects of the Budget Control Act, which Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed on Aug. 2, 2011, to end a standoff on the nation’s debt ceiling. That was when Republicans and some Democrats said the White House needed to reduce the nation’s debt in exchange for raising the amount the treasury can borrow, which Congress was required to approve. Had the debt ceiling not been raised, the United States could have defaulted on payments for the first time in history. In response to the showdown, Standard & Poor’s downgraded the nation’s credit rating anyway. Part of the Budget Control Act’s terms was $1.2 trillion in cuts, with a joint House and Senate super-committee responsible to find another $1.2 trillion in cuts by Nov. 23. If they didn’t agree on what to whittle away, across-the-board sequestration cuts would go into effect. Sequestration was essentially a dare that was supposed to threaten Congress into working together to find things to cut. But the super-committee couldn’t agree, and the sequestration began to impose $1.2 trillion in cuts over 10 years -- including $487 billion from defense. Neither the White House nor Congressional Democrats or Republicans like the practice, which (among other things) imposes spending caps on the defense budget. These caps increase a set amount each year, but generally not enough to keep up with inflation. That’s where we get to Rubio’s amendment, which aims to raise the defense budget back to 2012 spending projections without having to comply with the Budget Control Act caps. Drawing down the budget Rubio’s office did not confirm the source of his statistic, but it almost certainly came from the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments’ Analysis of the Fiscal Year 2015 Defense Budget, which was released in September 2014. The 2015 defense budget has three main parts: $495.6 billion in base discretionary funding, which is subject to the sequestration cap, and $58.6 billion for Overseas Contingency Operations, which is not capped. The contingency funding started with the name Global War on Terror under President George W. Bush after the Sept. 11 attacks. Obama changed the name to Overseas Contingency Operations but still used the fund to pay for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. The Iraq war officially ended in December 2010, so Afghanistan gets most of the contingency funding now. Also not subject to the cap is the third portion, $6.2 billion in mandatory funding, which includes retirement and pension payments. There are various other appropriations in the defense budget, such as Haiti earthquake relief in 2010 and Hurricane Sandy assistance in 2013. By comparison, fiscal year 2010 had a $527.9 billion base budget and $162.4 billion contingency budget. (The numbers we’re sharing now won’t add up to the exact same percentages as Rubio had them because of inflation adjustments and the range of appropriations included in the report.) Todd Harrison, senior fellow with the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments and the report's author, said Rubio correctly used his analysis as adjusted for inflation. But while it’s a matter of interpretation whether defense spending should go up, Rubio is lacking context, Harrison said. Today’s military has a little more than half the troops it had in Korea or Vietnam, and it’s relatively normal for spending to decrease this way as wars end. ""If you go back historically, and not even that far, levels now are comparable to 2007,"" Harrison said. ""It’s still above the level of spending during the majority of the Bush years."" Other economic and defense policy experts agreed with Harrison’s data-driven conclusions, but were somewhat split on Rubio’s stance. Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said even sequestration cuts weren’t making much of a dent in the highest relative defense spending since World War II. ""Cherry-picking a historic high to make your point about the level of cuts misrepresents the data, plain and simple,"" Ellis said. Janine Davidson, senior fellow for defense policy at the Council on Foreign Relations, said that even with the end of two wars, the Defense Department still needs to maintain some level of funding that would allow it to retain its status as a global military leader. Equipment needs to be upgraded or replaced, munitions must be restocked and increasingly expensive weapons systems must be replaced, she said. While the number of actual personnel is decreasing, costs are going up and a military presence is required in more and more places, such as backing allies and fighting extremists. ""It’s not just about spending more, it is about spending it wisely,"" she said. Our ruling Rubio said, ""Inflation-adjusted defense spending has declined 21 percent since 2010 and even if we discount the drawdowns in Iraq and Afghanistan it has still declined by a dangerous 12 percent."" While Rubio’s office didn’t get back to us, a Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments economist confirmed it was taken from an analysis he wrote about the fiscal year 2015 defense budget. Experts we talked to said while the conclusion is correct, Rubio doesn’t put the decrease in context of the historic high funding from 2010.

Dave Brat says Obama has issued 468,500 pages of regulations
","U.S. Rep. Dave Brat says President Barack Obama’s inauguration ushered in an era of sticky red tape. ""Since President Obama took office in January 2009, the federal government has issued more than 468,500 pages of regulations,"" Brat, R-7th wrote in a March 17 statement heralding the release of a House GOP budget. Brat said the Republican plan takes aim at the ""overwhelming amount"" of rules enacted under Obama. We wondered if it’s true that the U.S. has issued nearly a half million pages of regulations since Obama took the oath on Jan. 20, 2009. Brian Gottstein, a spokesman for Brat, told us the 468,500 figure comes from the GOP budget. The same page count also was cited in a Dec. 31, 2014 column in the Washington Examiner. The figure refers to the number of pages that were published in the Federal Register, a daily journal of the U.S. government that contains agency rules, proposed rules and public notices. Although rarely read by the general public, the Register is valuable to lawyers, lobbyists and policy wonks tracking the activities of agencies. In each edition, the Register posts a running tally of the pages printed so far the year. The final total at the end of December is often used as a gauge of regulatory activity during the year. Brat’s figure gives the total Register pages from Jan. 1, 2009 through Dec. 31, 2014. We tallied the total from the Jan. 20, 2009 start of Obama’s term through March 17, 2015, when Brat made his statement, and found there were 481,827 pages printed. So Brat slightly underestimated the volume under Obama. During the comparable period of former President George W. Bush’s term, the Register published 465,948 pages. But there’s a catch to these numbers. Many of these pages didn’t contain regulations. That’s because the Register also includes notices about agency meetings and public comment periods, presidential documents and other items that are not considered rules. Over the last 10 years, 58 percent of the Register’s pages have dealt with regulations, according to figures from the National Archives and Records Administration. Of almost 768,000 pages published during that span, 32 percent dealt with final regulations and 26 percent concerned proposed regulations. Overall Register page counts  ""may not be an accurate proxy for regulatory activity or measure of regulatory burden for several reasons,"" the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service said in November 2014 report. CRS noted that many of the pages ""typically have little, if anything to do with federal regulations."" And it said that many of the pages dealing with final rules don’t contain any regulatory language but rather record a ""preamble"" that has lengthy explanations about public comments on the rule. The CRS noted, for example, that a 2013 rule enacted as part of the Affordable Care Act filled 137 pages. But only 16 pages detailed the rule itself. Some rule changes are relatively routine, and some are temporary, CRS said. Any moves an agency makes to deregulate by eliminating a rule or streamlining it also have to be published in the Register. Cary Coglianese, a law professor and director of the Penn Program on Regulation at the University of Pennsylvania, said the Register page count is often cited because it’s easy to find. ""I wouldn’t use it as an indication of the level of regulation because it’s so prone to having so much else in it,"" Coglianese said. ""The other thing to keep in mind is, just because you know something about the number of pages, (that) doesn’t tell you the wisdom of having those pages. It might be those pages are helping to save people’s lives or keeping banks from failing or airplanes from crashing."" Peter Van Doren, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, is also leery of citing the page count, emailing us that it’s his ""least favorite"" way to measure regulation. Other analysts have written op-eds using the overall page count to give an idea of the country’s regulatory environment, including one from the conservative American Enterprise Institute and another from the Cato Institute. James Gattuso, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation, told PolitiFact Virginia for a 2011 article that the annual page count ""as a very broad measure"" indicates more regulatory activity now compared to past years. Here’s some further insight: There have been an average of 6,113 final and proposed rules published each year during the first six years of Obama’s term compared to 6,536 during the same span in Bush’s term. The Government Accountability Office tracks the number of ""major rules"" enacted. These essentially are regulations that have an annual economic effect of $100 million or more. During the first six years of Obama’s term, 485 major regulations were published compared to 333 during the same time period under Bush. Our ruling Brat said under Obama, the federal government has issued an 468,500 pages of regulations. The congressman is referring to the number pages published in the Federal Register since 2009. While Brat is right on the page count, he omits important information. Many of those pages don’t concern regulations at all, but are simply notices, executive orders and statements from agencies discussing public comments about a planned rule. About 58 percent of the pages deal with proposed and final regulations. About 32 percent of the pages detail rules that were actually enacted by the White House. Those who believe Washington is too intrusive may be unswayed these distinctions, but it’s Brat who chooses to describe regulation in terms of pages and his eye-popping number overstates the sheer volume of rules Obama has put in place.

Did Barack Obama vote for Religious Freedom Restoration Act with 'very same' wording as Indiana's?
","Indiana Gov. Mike Pence decried an ""avalanche of intolerance"" directed at his state Sunday after he signed a law that he says protects the religious freedom of Hoosiers. Critics, however, say it is Pence and Republican lawmakers who are promoting intolerance, with civil rights advocates and business leaders of Apple and Indiana-based organizations such as the NCAA and Angie’s List wary of the state’s new Religious Freedom Restoration Act opening the door for discrimination against gays and lesbians based on religious belief. That fear is overblown, Pence said on ABC This Week on March 29, 2015, pointing to support for similar legislation from two of the country’s highest-profile Democrats as evidence: President Bill Clinton, who signed the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act in 1993, and President Barack Obama. Sexual orientation ""doesn’t have anything to do with"" the law, Pence said. ""Then state-Sen. Barack Obama voted for (the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) when he was in the state senate of Illinois,"" Pence said. ""The very same language."" While Pence would not answer if Indiana businesses could refuse to serve gay couples, he repeated his point about Obama a few times. So we wanted to fact-check it. The bottom line: As an Illinois state senator, Obama did vote for a version of the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. It passed the Illinois Senate 56-0 and became law on July 1, 1998. However, the language isn’t the ""very same,"" and the claim is not as simple as lining up one vote next to the other and declaring them equal, experts told us. Then and now The 1993 federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act was signed by Clinton with overwhelming bipartisan support. The bill passed the House unanimously and 97-3 in the Senate. The intent of the bill was to protect religious practices from government interference, such as whether a Muslim prison guard could wear a beard, or if a Jehovah’s Witness needed special coverage for medical procedures because he or she is against blood transfusions, or Native American religious practices. States started passing their own laws when the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1997 that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act signed did not apply to the states. Since then, 19 states have passed their own laws. Many, like Illinois, did so in the initial wave. Fast-forward to the current climate. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to weigh in on the constitutionality of same-sex marriage bans. Meanwhile, same-sex marriage bans in states like Indiana have been struck down by lower courts, dramatically changing the concept of legal marriage at breakneck speed. Conservatives in Indiana and elsewhere see the Religious Freedom Restoration Act as a vehicle for fighting back against the legalization of same-sex marriage.   In 2015, lawmakers in 16 states have introduced legislation that proposes or changes laws protecting religious liberty. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer vetoed a similar but more widely opposed law in 2014. When Pence signed SB 101 in a private ceremony, three people who work for groups that supported the same-sex marriage ban and want to limit civil rights for gays and lesbians were in attendance. One of the lobbyists, Eric Miller of Advance America, heralded the state’s law as protecting Christian bakers, florists and photographers from penalty ""for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage, among other examples."" This is a direct reference to high-profile cases of Christian wedding vendors refusing to provide services for gay couples in other states. In his ABC interview, Pence said Indiana’s law followed the Hobby Lobby case before the Supreme Court last year, in which the court ruled 5-4 that the federal Religious Freedom Restoration Act protects family owned corporations from being forced to offer insurance that covers contraception under the health care law. In one sense, there isn’t all that much difference between the bill that got Obama’s vote in Illinois 17 years ago and the bill that Pence signed into law last week. But how people want the law applied, on top of other legislative changes, has changed the landscape dramatically, said Steve Sanders, Indiana University Maurer School of Law professor of family and constitutional law. ""What has completely changed are the politics around the issue, the symbolism of what voting for one of these laws means,"" Sanders said. In other words, it’s how some conservatives want Indiana’s law to work that fosters fear among civil rights advocates for how it might. Still, constitutional law professors say both sides are misinterpreting the point of these laws. The courts have not approved exemptions to discriminate against gays under religious freedom laws, and likely would not because the government has a compelling interest in protecting civil rights. The two sides are essentially yelling past one another about a non-issue when they should be working on enacting protections based on sexual orientation in Indiana, said Robin Fretwell Wilson, professor and director of the family law and policy program at the University of Illinois College of Law. ""If there’s a license to discriminate in Indiana, it’s the fact there’s an absence of a statewide law that makes a promise to the LGBT community,"" she said. ""RFRA is about minoritarian religion against government, by and large."" LGBT protections Indiana and Illinois are neighbors in geography but strangers in their approach to gay rights. This difference adds another layer of context to consider with Pence’s claim. In 2004, Illinois lawmakers passed anti-discrimination laws based on sexual orientation for housing, employment, public accommodation, credit and other measures. Nine years later, the state passed a same-sex marriage law. These protections did not exist in the state when Obama cast his vote, but same-sex marriage was not part of the discussion as it is now, as it was not yet legalized, Wilson said. Pressed by Stephanopoulos, Pence said he would not seek protections based on sexual orientation in Indiana and would not say whether Hoosiers could refuse services to gays or lesbians. ""To say, ‘We did what Illinois did,’ without acknowledging the fact that Illinois gave protections, really misses the real debate,"" Wilson said. An Indianapolis Star exploration of what the law means for the state suggested LGBT rights may succeed in RFRA challenges in the few cities that have passed nondiscrimination ordinances. But whether the state as a whole has a ""compelling interest"" in protecting LGBT rights over religious beliefs remains to be seen, the report said. Lambda Legal, a nonprofit that fights for gay rights, said Indiana’s lack of protections for gays and lesbians is important because people who do not want to take business from gays and lesbians ""may claim that lack of a statewide law barring sexual orientation and gender identity discriminating means that there is no compelling state interest in enforcing local ordinances providing such protections."" Sanders of Indiana University said the problem is that people in Indiana might think they can discriminate against gays and lesbians now even if a court does not eventually side with them. ""The fine print is that if someone wants to discriminate, they have to be able to argue in court for that right, and the court will eventually decide,"" Sanders said. Difference in wording The wording of each state’s law is similar in that neither mentions sexual orientation or discrimination. But the Human Rights Campaign, which opposes Indiana’s law, says the law is fundamentally different than the federal version and Illinois’ over its definition of ""person."" Under Indiana’s post-Hobby Lobby law, a ""person"" is extended to mean ""a partnership, a limited liability company, a corporation, a company, a firm, a society, a joint-stock company, an unincorporated association"" or another entity driven by religious belief that can sue and be sued. To the Human Rights Campaign, this nullifies Pence’s claim that his law is nothing new from the Illinois law. ""That means a corporation in Indiana has a cause of action to sue the government claiming religious personhood for the purposes of this law,"" said HRC spokesman Adam Talbot. To Wilson, the inclusion of a corporation is not surprising. It was not typical to define ""person"" in religious freedom legislation, she said, which gets to the heart of the Hobby Lobby case. The Supreme Court decided laws could be applied to ""closely held"" companies operating on religious belief. Further, all three laws contain the ""same critical language"" that if someone feels substantially burdened by a regulation or law, the government has to justify a ""compelling government interest"" for it to the court, said Douglas Laycock, a University of Virginia constitutional law professor (Laycock and Wilson co-signed a letter to Indiana Senate Republicans in support of SB 101 not because its effects will be ""radical"" but but because it offered ""more transparent and more secure"" protections of religious liberty.) The Illinois law does not address the ""person"" question because it mirrors the federal law, which was interpreted to apply to corporations because the U.S. Code includes ""corporations"" as a person, Laycock said. ""As a practical matter, there are almost no cases involving corporations because very few are running on religious lines,"" Laycock said. The American Civil Liberties Union, meanwhile, is concerned about another difference in the wording of the two laws. Indiana’s law includes language that allows people to claim a religious freedom exemption ""regardless of whether the state or any other governmental entity is a party to the proceeding."" That language is absent from the Illinois law. ""The Illinois law was written and designed to allow someone to change the government’s burdens on people’s religious beliefs,"" said Eunice Rho, American Civil Liberties Union advocacy and policy counsel. ""The Indiana law specifically says you can use the law in a lawsuit even if the government isn’t a party."" Ultimately, judges will have to interpret the intent of the Indiana law’s language. But that doesn’t change that there are differences between it and the counterpart in Illinois. Our ruling Pence played defense Sunday, saying, that sexual orientation ""doesn’t have anything to do with"" the Religious Freedom Restoration Act,"" adding that ""then state-Sen Barack Obama voted for (the Religious Freedom Restoration Act) when he was in the state Senate of Illinois. The very same language."" A spokeswoman for Pence did not respond. The vote is clear enough, as is the name of the bill, but Pence’s explanation is an oversimplification of the purpose of the law then and the motivation of some pushing the law now. Proponents of this law are pushing the measure as a way that businesses can seek protection ""for refusing to participate in a homosexual marriage."" Whether that argument will win in the courts is up for debate. That was far from an intent of Illinois’ law, or the others passed more than 15 years ago. As for the language itself, Pence is incorrect to say the language is the same. Some pro-LGBT rights groups say the outright inclusion of a corporation or company as a ""person"" is overly broad, though the true impact will likely only really be settled when matters are sent to a court. Overall, Pence’s claim is partially accurate but misses important context. We rate it Half True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/36a68b63-b574-4232-b679-9f90e5b12b9a",/factchecks/2015/mar/29/mike-pence/did-barack-obama-vote-religious-freedom-restoratio/

How many bills has Ted Cruz passed in the Senate? 1
","Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, is known for sticking to his principles, but that might trip him up if he were to become president, a position that requires compromise, said CNN host Dana Bash. ""Give me an example where you have successfully compromised in the United States Senate with Democrats,"" Bash asked Cruz on CNN’s State of the Union March 29. Cruz mentioned his sponsorship of a bill that denied admission to the United States any United Nations representative who poses a national security threat (a response to Iran’s chosen U.N. representative). The bill passed unanimously in both the Senate and the House. But that bill that was non-controversial, and it is the only bill Cruz has passed in his two years in office, Bash added. ""It's fair that there's just one piece of legislation that is now law with your name on it?"" she asked. Just one? Is that right? The laws We looked through Cruz’s legislative history on Congressional Quarterly’s database and found that since he became a senator in January 2013, he has been the main sponsor on 44 bills and a cosponsor on 187. Of those on which he was the primary sponsor, only one passed, as Bash said. This bill, the one Cruz mentioned in the interview, passed unanimously in April 2014 and was intended to stop Iran’s proposed U.N. envoy from entering the United States. Iranian Ambassador Hamid Aboutalebi was involved in holding more than 50 Americans hostage in the U.S. Embassy in Iran in the 1970s. Cruz’s name is on two more laws as a cosponsor. He was one of 80 senators to cosponsor a July 2014 bill to enhance cooperative programs between the United States and Israel. He also joined a bipartisan group of 22 senators behind an August 2014 bill establishing a special envoy to promote religious freedom in parts of Asia. It’s worth noting that many of the bills Cruz cosponsored were Senate resolutions, which are legislative measures that don’t go to the president and don’t carry the force of law, such as a resolution that commemorates the 70th anniversary of the liberation of the Nazi concentration camp Auschwitz. Many of these passed. He’s also had measures pass through the Senate as a sponsor or cosponsor, even if they didn’t eventually become law. So it’s true that Cruz hasn’t had many of his ideas signed into law, but is it the best way to tell if he has been an effective senator? Experts told us it’s an incomplete measurement, so let’s add some context. The context First of all, Cruz has only been in Congress for two years. In 2014, National Journal analyzed which senators have sponsored or cosponsored the most bills that eventually became law and found unsurprisingly that the longer a senator had been in office, the more bills they passed. Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, has passed more than 740 and has been in the Senate since 1977. In his first two years in the Senate, Cruz was a member of the minority party, which put him and fellow Republicans at a disadvantage. It’s expected that the majority leader will schedule bills for his own party more frequently than for the minority, said Joshua Huder, senior fellow at Georgetown University’s Government Affairs Institute. Even within their own party, more junior members’ priorities are at the back of the line. ""First-term senators have a lot of headwinds, particularly when in the minority,"" Huder said. ""Nothing about Cruz's position really sets him up for legislative success."" That said, the Senate’s design allows for individual members to make a difference, even if they’re not in the majority, said Sarah Binder, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and an expert in legislative politics. They make a difference in ways other than just passing laws, which weakens this particular measurement of legislative effectiveness, Binder added. They can sponsor amendments to bills, for example, or their bills can get absorbed into broad omnibus legislation. Cruz successfully sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act that will give Purple Hearts to those killed or wounded in the shooting at Fort Hood in Texas in 2009. Or, they can put a plug in the opposing party’s agenda. Cruz played a role in keeping an International Monetary Fund reform measure out of a bill to give aid to Ukraine. He has also spearheaded efforts to block presidential appointments to push his priorities. Another problem with simply counting the number of bills passed is that it doesn’t account for individual bills’ importance or political salience, Binder added. And the Senate is only one-third of the lawmaking process (the other parts being the House and the president), so much of getting a law passed is out of the sponsor’s hands, Huder said. Bash told PolitiFact she agrees that the number of laws passed is not the only barometer of success for a senator -- particularly a senator like Cruz who is interested in dismantling quite a few laws. She also said she agrees that being in the minority party during a time of excess gridlock put Cruz at a disadvantage. In sum, Cruz’s record is better than Bash makes it out to be, Huder said, but it’s still not great. ""Cruz paints himself as an ideological outsider,"" he said. ""That stance isn't conducive to lawmaking in a chamber built to foster bipartisan consensus.""   In fact, Cruz essentially agreed with Bash in the interview, but blamed former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. ""We passed next to nothing,"" Cruz said. Our ruling Bash said there’s only ""one piece of legislation that is now law that has (Ted Cruz’s) name on it."" Of the bills Cruz has sponsored, only one has been signed into law. However, he has cosponsored two eventual laws, as well as many resolutions that passed but didn’t have to go to Obama’s desk (and don’t carry the force of law). Experts told us that this isn’t a great measurement of a legislator’s effectiveness, and there are other ways to show his impact in Congress. Also, Cruz has had many factors working against him: He is a junior senator, and he spent his first two years as a member of the minority party. Bash’s claim misses that additional information.

Gov. Gina Raimondo says R.I.'s Medicaid costs per enrollee are second highest in the U.S.
","In an effort to bring Rhode Island's budget under control, Gov. Gina Raimondo is hoping to rein in the cost of Medicaid. She has proposed cutting $88 million from the state’s $2.7-billion Medicaid spending in the next fiscal year and has created a task force to ""reinvent"" the program. During the March 13, 2015 taping of WPRI-TV's ""Newsmakers"" program, Raimondo argued that the costs of the joint state and federal program that provides health insurance to the very poor are extraordinarily high in the state. ""You have to remember,"" she said, ""Rhode Island has the second highest per enrollee [Medicaid] cost of any state in the country, which is 60 percent higher than the national average. So we have to do a better job. It's just not sustainable."" She made a similar statement on Rhode Island Public Radio. Paying, on average, 60 percent more for anything seems pretty scandalous. We decided to see if the typical cost of a Rhode Island Medicaid recipient was really that much higher than average, and whether per-patient costs were actually lower in 48 other states. The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation is a reliable source of data on health issues. We got a state-by-state tally of total state and federal Medicaid spending for the 2013 fiscal year and divided it by the number of people in each state on Medicaid in December 2013 in hopes of getting a rough estimate. By that back-of-the-envelope method, Rhode Island ranked fifth, not second, with all the New England states except New Hampshire in the top 10. The cost was 39 percent above the national average. But that's using 12 months of expenses and one-month enrollment totals. Laura Snyder, a senior policy analyst with Kaiser, said that's an apples-to-oranges mix. When we asked Raimondo's office for the source of her numbers, her spokeswoman cited Kaiser as well, specifically a page that directly ranks Medicaid spending per enrollee by state, although it doesn't list actual total spending or enrollment. And it's from  the 2011 fiscal year. Nonetheless, on that list, Rhode Island, at $9,247 per enrollee, does indeed rank second. Only Alaska, at $9,474, spent more. In addition, per enrollee spending in Rhode Island was 60 percent higher than the $5,790 U.S. average. So, by that ranking, Raimondo is correct on both counts. We asked why newer numbers aren't available. Snyder said annual enrollment statistics by state are slow to come out from the federal government, so the 2011 data are the most recent available. Because we wondered if state rankings fluctuate significantly from year to year -- and might be significantly different in 2012, 2013 and 2014 -- we asked Kaiser to see its rankings from some previous years. They gave us data going back to 2000. It turns out that our standing has bounced around a bit, but not a lot. For example, Rhode Island ranked fifth in 2010 and 2009, but ranked first in 2007. Our ruling Raimondo said, ""Rhode Island has the second highest per enrollee [Medicaid] cost of any state in the country, which is 60 percent higher than the national average."" But in making her statement on one of the central elements in her proposed budget, Raimondo didn’t note that the numbers were from the 2011 year. Granted, those are the most recent statistics available, according to Kaiser. But a lot can happen in four years. Because the statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, we rule it Mostly True.

Lindsey Graham says taking 'every penny' from wealthiest 1 percent won't balance budget
","For years, politicians have insisted on the importance of balancing the federal budget. Recurring budget deficits -- with hardly any intervening surpluses -- have created a national debt of $18.2 trillion, and federal spending continues to outpace tax receipts. Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., recently came to New Hampshire to test the waters for a presidential bid, talking about the deficit at a Politics and Pies appearance in Concord. During a question-and-answer session, he said the country needed to simplify the tax code and reform entitlements. To put in perspective just how much money he was talking about, he said, ""If you took every penny of the (richest) 1 percent, including their dog, you wouldn't even begin to balance the budget."" Really? Politifact New Hampshire decided to check it out. We first checked with Graham’s Senate office. His spokesman, Kevin Bishop, sent along a piece from the Wall Street Journal opinion section that talks about the difficulty of balancing the budget solely by taxing the income of the country’s richest people. That may be true, but it’s also not the way Graham phrased it. Graham didn’t single out the income taxes of the richest 1 percent; he said ""every penny of the 1 percent"" (while throwing in their pets for good measure). There’s enough wiggle room in Graham’s statement to allow for three plausible ways to define ""every penny"" --  total wealth, total income and total taxes for the richest 1 percent.  We’ll look at each. Wealth Figuring out how much wealth -- stocks, bonds, income, real estate, and the like -- is held by the nation’s richest 1 percent holds is somewhat tricky because some of those elements are hard to measure. But there have been several estimates. On the low end, the Boston Consulting Group puts the amount of privately held wealth in the United States at $39 trillion for 2012. The group’s figure is based on a proprietary formula and excludes real estate, businesses owned by investors and luxury goods. On the upper end, the U.S. Federal Reserve cited the net worth of all U.S. households and nonprofits at $69.5 trillion for 2012. That number includes the value of real estate and of nonprofit organizations, some of which are closely held by individuals. A middle ground can be found in data compiled for the nonprofit National Bureau of Economic Research by Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman. Their definition of national wealth excludes nonprofits, and comes in at $55.2 trillion for 2012. These estimates all look at the entire nation’s holdings. What about the share owned by the richest 1 percent? In a paper, Saez and Zucman found that the top 1 percent own 41.8 percent of the country’s wealth. Estimates from other researchers showed a somewhat lower percentage -- 35.6 percent and 35.4 percent, depending on the year. Using their own data set, that means the richest 1 percent have holdings worth about $23 trillion. If you apply their 41.8 percentage to the other two estimates, the amount ranges from $16 trillion to $29 trillion. Each figure is easily enough to balance the U.S. budget, which ran a $483 billion deficit last year and which is projected to be $486 billion in the red this year, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Even adding up deficits for the next decade gives us $7.7 trillion -- a total easily covered by that $26.2 trillion that could (at least in this example) be confiscated from our nation’s richest residents. Another way to look at it: All federal spending in 2012 totaled $3.5 trillion. So the richest 1 percent’s wealth could also pay off the year’s entire budget -- six-and-a-half times over. In fact, even the lowest of the three wealth estimates would come close to wiping out the country’s current level of accumulated debt, which stands in excess of $18 trillion. Income Even if you use the income of the 1 percent, it’s still a number far greater than you would need to balance the budget. The data collected by Saez and Zucman show a national income of $14 trillion for 2012. The Federal Reserve reports the same number for the same year. On the low end, the IRS reported $9 trillion in adjusted gross income for 2012. The richest 1 percent’s share of the income for 2012, according to the Paris School of Economics’ interactive database, is 22.8 percent (including capital gains). That means taking the entirety of the group’s income that year would net us somewhere between $2 trillion and $3.2 trillion. In other words, if you use total income of the 1 percent, you don’t even have to raid Fido’s food bowl to do what Graham suggests. Taxes And what of the actual tax burden of the 1 percent? According to estimates from the independent Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, the richest 1 percent paid 27 percent of all federal income taxes in 2012. They had an average income of $1.8 million apiece that year and paid an average of $489,437 in taxes. That works out, roughly, to some $563 billion in taxes collected from the richest in 2012. A tidy sum, to be sure, but it has already been applied to offset our government’s costs. One would have to double the taxes collected from the group to cover current deficits. This is the one scenario in which Graham has a point. Our ruling Graham said, ""If you took every penny of the (richest) 1 percent, including their dog, you wouldn't even begin to balance the budget."" Graham has a point if you take it the way his staff suggests he meant to say it. But the talking point (which, to be clear, no one is suggesting as a real policy) came out more broadly. If you use either total wealth or total income -- interpretations we think are at least as plausible given his ""every penny"" remarks -- Graham is off base.  On balance, we rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/mar/27/lindsey-graham/lindsey-graham-says-taking-every-penny-wealthiest-/

GOP Texas House candidate repeats false claim that FBI agents instigated Jan. 6 attack on US Capitol
","Texas businessman Mauro Garza, who is trying for a third time to win a seat in Congress and facing a crowded field of Republican primary opponents, is airing an ad that repeated a false conspiracy theory about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.   Over images of the attack on the U.S. Capitol, a narrator in Garza’s TV ad said:  ""They call it an insurrection. But what really happened January 6th? Were FBI agents used as political agitators?"" The ad ends with the narrator saying that in Congress, Garza ""will join other pro-Trump patriots to expose the truth, bring justice to political prisoners and take on the Washington swamp.""  “They call it an insurrection. But what really happened January 6th? Were FBI agents used as political agitators?""New TV spot running aired morning from Mauro Garza, one of several Rs running for an open House seat in southern Texas. pic.twitter.com/OK8jur0quR We have repeatedly debunked the claim that the FBI agents instigated or participated in the attack on the Capitol. There was never compelling evidence that the FBI or any other government agency instigated the attack and, with more than 700 people facing charges related to the day’s events, there still isn’t. What the evidence does show is that hundreds of supporters of then-President Donald Trump stormed the U.S. Capitol in a brazen attempt to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden’s victory in the 2020 presidential election.  A House select committee is investigating a range of activities by Trump, his aides and his supporters seeking to disrupt the counting of electoral votes and overturn the legitimate results of that election. Garza’s claim follows a pattern of Republican officials and candidates, Trump sympathizers and right-wing media figures trying to redirect blame for the attack, or play down its significance, a campaign we called our Lie of the Year for 2021. The false-flag theory of FBI involvement in the attack grew out of a misinterpretation of the federal charging documents against the alleged rioters. Because some of the documents also mentioned unindicted, unnamed co-conspirators, the theory went, it would be reasonable to assume that those people were FBI informants or agents.  The theory also raised the issue of whether these figures were ""instigators"" during the storming of the Capitol, suggesting not only that the government was involved, but also that its agents caused violence and damage, rather than stopping it. In June, we reported on why the premise of the theory is wrong. Experts explained that under almost no circumstances can undercover government operatives and informants be described in government filings as co-conspirators. The main reason: A component of criminal conspiracy is the agreement to commit a crime. That isn’t what undercover operatives do. Even so, Trump sympathizers have continued to push the false theory. In November, Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson claimed, without any credible evidence, that federal agents directly incited people on Jan. 6, and ""intentionally entrapped"" American citizens. Our rating was False.  In January, Ray Epps, an Arizona man whom Carlson and others held up as a possible undercover FBI agent or informant, said he had no ties to the FBI; and Rally Runner, another man singled out on Carlson’s show, said on Carlson’s segment that suggesting he was a federal agent was a ""false story."" We sent emails to the address listed on Garza’s campaign website and on his campaign organization statement, but did not receive a reply. Garza describes himself as an entrepreneur in commercial real estate, consumer products and hospitality. A news article on his 2020 campaign described him as the owner of a popular San Antonio nightclub. Garza is vying for an open seat in Texas’ reorganized 15th Congressional District, which includes areas around San Antonio, Corpus Christi and communities to the south. The seat is open because the incumbent, Democrat Vicente Gonazles, chose to run for House District 34 after Republican redistricting made District 15 more competitive. The Cook Political Report, Inside Elections and Sabato’s Crystal Ball all rate the race as ""lean"" or ""tilt"" Republican.  Garza is one of nine Republicans running in the March 1 primary, along with six Democrats.  This is Garza’s third run for the House. In 2018, he won less than 1% of the vote in the GOP primary in the 21st district; in 2020, he won the GOP primary in District 20, but lost to the incumbent, Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro.  Garza’s ad stated: ""They call"" Jan. 6 ""an insurrection,"" but ""were FBI agents used as political agitators?""

But the screenshot is missing context from the article.  In the Vice article, the list of potential ways to improve mask effectiveness follows an explanation of a study that was conducted largely by researchers from the University of Cambridge. The researchers tested a variety of popular approaches to improving mask fit — termed ""fit hacks"" — to see if any would improve the performance of KN95 and surgical masks. The Facebook post screenshot showed the ""fit hacks"" that were tested.  Researchers assessed the fit of surgical and KN95 masks, both with and without the fit hacks, by taking air samples ""to continuously measure the concentrations of particles both inside and outside of a donned mask."" The study found that nearly all of the hacks improved mask fit and made them more effective, and using a layer of pantyhose to hold masks more tightly to the face was the most effective. Individual facial features also impacted fit.   But the researchers said many of the hacks were ""so uncomfortable as to be unusable in some cases."" Eugenia O’Kelly, a researcher at the University of Cambridge and the study’s lead author, acknowledged the limitations of the research. ""Using an effective but uncomfortable hack may make good sense in some high-risk situations, where the discomfort is worth it for the added protection,"" she said, ""but it would be harder to wear these hacks day in and day out."" The researchers called for more study — particularly further research on cloth masks — and testing other fit hacks. ""We hope these results can be used in the design of future masks, in order to ensure that they are as tight to the face as possible, for as many wearers as possible, without making them uncomfortable,"" O’Kelly said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends people wear masks that fit snugly to the face and have layers. For the omicron variant, experts recommend layering cloth masks and surgical masks or wearing even more protective KN95s or N95s. A Facebook post suggested that binding a mask to your face with gauze, wearing a section of pantyhose over your head and mask and other approaches were the newest ""suggestions to make your mask more ‘effective.’"" The post frames the ""fit hacks"" shown in the screenshot as recommendations.

According to the narrator, who describes himself in the clip as a ""lab science director,"" food scientists ""have found a way to cause food crops to grow RNA fragments that can be targeted like bioweapons to interfere with physiological processes of targeted species that might eat the food."" He said it’s called ""RNA interference technology,"" and it’s being touted as a way to eliminate pesticides, because it can kill pests. ""What’s disturbing,"" he continues, ""is that this technology can be fine-tuned to target a specific race of humans who eat the food."" The video’s claims appear to stem from a 2017 article published on the website for Natural News, an outlet that has spread misinformation about COVID-19 and vaccines, and has been banned from Facebook and other major platforms.   But the Natural News article is speculative and draws together a 1969 article from The New York Times about a United Nations conference with a discussion of gene-splicing research from 1998 and 2008, none of which prove what the article is suggesting. We spoke with scientists who have expertise in RNA interference technology in plants, and they all told us that this claim that existing technology can be used to modify food crops and cause infertility in Black people is not accurate. That technology doesn’t exist right now, and might never exist, they said. RNA interference, or RNAi, is a technology that can silence genes and is a natural process, said Sam R. Nugen, professor of food and biosystems engineering at Cornell University. It can potentially be designed to silence undesirable genes for treating genetic disease, and has many potential uses in agriculture, he said.  The technology can be used to alter food crops, fight pests, make food more nutritious, or make it more resilient against climate change impacts, said Neelima Sinha, a distinguished professor in plant biology at the University of California, Davis. But scientists don’t know what genes make up ethnicities, so targeting a specific race through this technology is not possible, Sinha said.  Nugen described at least five technological problems with the claim that Black people could be made infertile with RNAi, not least of which is delivery — the RNAi system would have to get to the body part being targeted.  Some scientific research has shown that human consumption of food that has been altered with this RNAi technology is safe, because the body breaks down the affected RNA during digestion, prohibiting the spread to other organs.  In addition, scientists don’t know how to cause infertility through the food supply, and are not looking for ways to do it, Sinha said. ""Every layer of this is stacked on things that don’t happen,"" Sinha said. Jonathan Lundgren, a scientist who worked for the USDA, said that, to his knowledge, it has never been demonstrated that food including RNA interference affects humans through consumption.  The RNAi would have to be engineered in a way that could bypass the physical, chemical, and cellular defenses of the gut in order to be taken into the body’s cells, said Lundgren, an agroecologist who runs a farm in South Dakota. The RNAi would also have to be at a dose high enough and be ingested consistently enough that prolonged gene expression in the targeted cells or organs would be suppressed. He said that this is all extremely challenging. To include a race-specific component ""seems beyond our capabilities,"" he said, because it’s not clear that a race-specific reproductive gene exists.  A video claims that technology exists that would allow food to be engineered to cause infertility in Black people.  Scientists told us that RNA interference technology does exist in food crops, but that genes indicating race, if they exist, have not been identified. Furthermore, it has not been established that this technology can be used to affect humans through food.  We rate this False.    ",/factchecks/2022/feb/07/naturalnewscom/no-food-cannot-be-engineered-create-infertility-bl/

Jan. 6 attorney defends Oath Keepers with dubious claim that ‘it’s not illegal’ to enter Capitol
","In a verbal sparring match with CNN anchor Brianna Keilar, a lawyer representing Oath Keepers militia leaders charged with some of the most serious crimes involving the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol offered up a new line of defense for his clients. ""I've had lunch in the Capitol for no reason,"" attorney Jonathon Moseley said during the Feb. 1 interview. ""It's not illegal to go inside the Capitol."" ""Did you break through the window to get into lunch?"" Keilar interjected, as the network aired footage of the rioters forcing their way through Capitol doors. ""Hundreds of people do it everyday,"" Moseley said in response. ""We’re getting into a lot of the weeds in terms of whether the signs making an exception that day were visible or not.""  Moseley, an attorney and self-described activist, is representing several Jan. 6 defendants. Keilar introduced him as counsel for Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the far-right Oath Keepers militia, and Kelly Meggs, head of the group’s Florida chapter. Rhodes and Meggs were two of the 11 Oath Keepers indicted on charges of seditious conspiracy for their pre-planning and coordination on Jan. 6, which involved stationing weapons across the Potomac River in Virginia. In an email to PolitiFact, Moseley said his on-air comment was being misinterpreted, and that he was talking on CNN about what’s ""normally"" allowed at the Capitol.  ""You do not need a reason to enter the U.S. Capitol,"" Moseley said. ""You can enter any time you want during business hours just because you feel like."" But the attorney’s comments on CNN came during a back-and-forth about Jan. 6, in response to Keilar’s claim that the way the Oath Keepers and other rioters entered the Capitol was ""clearly illegal."" The implication — and the impression viewers could have come away with — was that it is ""not illegal"" to enter the Capitol as the Oath Keepers and other Jan. 6 rioters did. That’s wrong. The rioters pushed past barricades, scaled walls, fought with police, and broke through windows, storming into the building on a day when it was closed to the general public. That’s why the Justice Department charged approximately 640 of the first 725 people arrested for the attack with entering or remaining in a restricted federal building or grounds. ""When it comes to the violations on Jan. 6, it is not relevant whether or not the U.S. Capitol is a public building,"" the Capitol Police said in a statement to PolitiFact. ""It was not open to the general public that day. First, because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, because of the Joint Session of Congress. The rioters violated the law the moment they crossed the police line."" RELATED VIDEO  There was once a time when the general public could stroll into the Capitol building with no limits, but those days are decades in the past, according to a report from the United States Capitol Historical Society. Security measures ramped up over time, first after bombings in 1974 and 1983, and then with the installation of the $600 million Capitol Visitor Center, which opened in 2008 and followed the fatal shooting in 1998 of two Capitol Police officers. Nowadays, the public’s access to the Capitol is much more restricted, and even that access has halted as the building closed to the public during the COVID-19 pandemic.  Tourists visit the Capitol Visitors Center on Capitol Hill in Washington on March 12, 2020. (AP) ""It's only legal to go into the Capitol buildings when and to the extent that they are open to the public,"" said David Alan Sklansky, a professor of law at Stanford Law School.  Even if the Capitol had been open on Jan. 6, Sklansky said, it would have still been illegal for the rioters to wander as they did into areas off-limits to the public — such as the floor of the Senate Chamber. Before the pandemic, and only during business hours, the public could enter through the Capitol Visitor Center and its associated security checkpoints for guide-led tours requiring a pass, said Jane L. Campbell, president and CEO of the United States Capitol Historical Society.  They could observe House or Senate proceedings from the upper-level galleries that surround the chambers if they got passes by contacting or visiting the offices of their representatives or senators. They could also visit other areas by appointment. Those who stormed the Capitol didn’t enter through the Capitol Visitor Center; they didn’t go through security screenings; they didn’t reserve tour slots, stick to designated tourist zones, and stay with tour guides; and they didn’t get passes to enter the Senate or House galleries.  PolitiFact rated the claim that the attack was a ""normal tourist visit"" Pants on Fire.  Rioters try to break through a police barrier at the Capitol in Washington on Jan. 6, 2021. (AP) In his email to PolitiFact, Moseley argued that there were ""no warning signs"" indicating that the Capitol was closed due to COVID-19. ""Legally, the most public government building in the world is not closed due to COVID-19 unless the public is given notice,"" Moseley wrote. But in the same response, Moseley also acknowledged that the police barricades surrounding the building had signs indicating that the area was closed.  The Justice Department has described in charging documents the permanent and temporary barriers, including bike racks and fencing around the Capitol, that separated the ""restricted grounds"" on Jan. 6 from the areas where the permitted rallies that day were to take place.  A screenshot from Justice Department charging documents in a case related to the Capitol attack shows a description and map of the barriers in place on Jan. 6, 2021. ""Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the U.S. Capitol Building and Congressional Office Buildings remain closed to the public,"" the U.S. Capitol Police’s website said on Jan. 6, 2021. Charging documents alleged that the Oath Keepers brought ""paramilitary gear, weapons, and supplies-including knives, batons, camouflaged combat uniforms, tactical vests with plates, helmets, eye protection, and radio equipment to the Capitol grounds."" Weapons are on the list of items ""strictly prohibited"" inside the Capitol. While Rhodes did not enter the Capitol himself, prosecutors said he orchestrated the Oath Keepers’ attack and ""oversaw two military-style stacks of co-conspirators who, along with other rioters, forcibly breached the Capitol while armed QRF teams stood by, awaiting deployment."" Meggs was a part of one such stack that prosecutors said joined the rioters as they clashed with police and breached the Capitol doors. The stack ""stormed into the Capitol alongside the mob.""  Moseley said that ""it’s not illegal to go inside the Capitol"" as the Oath Keepers and other Jan. 6 rioters did. The public can enter the Capitol when the building is open, assuming they abide by certain procedures and rules governing what’s allowed inside.  But the Jan. 6 rioters violently stormed the building on a day when it was closed to the public. They fought off police and knocked over the barriers that secured the outside before breaking in and entering restricted areas. Many carried weapons not allowed on Capitol grounds.

Milwaukee mayor in ballpark on stolen vehicle figures, but overstates reckless driving fatalities
","Stolen cars and the reckless driving that follows have climbed to the top of the worry list for Milwaukee residents who are now facing the first open mayoral race since 2004. A primary is scheduled for Feb. 15, with the spring election April 5. Acting Mayor Cavalier Johnson, who is among seven candidates, unveiled a plan in a Dec. 21, 2021 news release dubbed S.T.A.N.D. for Safer Streets. City officials say the plan focuses on:  Safe street design  Traffic enforcement  Accountability  Neighborhood Engagement   Demand progress  It includes physical road improvements; stepped-up police enforcement, a new policy for towing unregistered or unlicensed vehicle operators who are caught driving at dangerous speeds; and a staff member in the mayor’s office to coordinate the plan across city departments and work with residents and businesses.  ""As a parent of three children in Milwaukee, and someone who drives these streets daily, I find the statistics around automobile accidents and vehicle thefts unacceptable,"" said Johnson.  To be sure, at the time Johnson was the incoming mayor, since Mayor Tom Barrett – who had been confirmed as U.S. ambassador to Luxembourg – had not yet resigned. Johnson was sworn in as acting mayor two days later. The news release went on to state that ""in 2021, 65 people in Milwaukee lost their lives due to reckless driving accidents, and more than 9,000 cars were stolen, double the amount in 2020.""  Let’s look at both parts of the claim. When asked for supporting data to back up Johnson’s statement, city staffers directed our  attention to Milwaukee Police Department Traffic Safety Unit statistics. According to MPD data, the city saw 66 traffic fatalities in 2021 (as of Feb. 3, 2022, there had been 6). Johnson’s news release cited a figure of 65, so obviously one additional fatality occurred between that date and Dec. 31, 2021. But there is an important factor that gums up the claim: Johnson’s news release is citing reckless driving fatalities, while the MPD statistics simply cite traffic fatalities.   Here is the department’s breakdown on traffic fatalities for 2021: 66 individuals were killed in fatal crashes There were 61 fatal crash incidents But only 38 of the 61 of the crashes involved reckless driving (62%) The 38 reckless vehicle crashes resulted in 43 fatalities.  ""The fact that dozens of people died in such crashes verifies the seriousness of the problem,"" said Jeff Fleming, communications director for the mayor’s office, in an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin. ""Nevertheless, we overstated last year’s reckless driving death toll."" As a point of reference, Karen Domagalski, operations manager at the Milwaukee County Medical Examiner’s Office, said there were 87 motor vehicle accident deaths in 2021 throughout the county, so deaths in accidents in the city accounted for nearly 76% percent of those.  In Milwaukee, residents have increasingly raised concerns about reckless driving. Here is just a sampling of those incidents from 2021: June 16, 2021: A 16-year-old boy was killed and five other teens were hospitalized when police attempted to stop a stolen vehicle on the 9900 block of West Good Hope Road, but the driver instead led officers on a chase and eventually crossed over into oncoming traffic, hitting another vehicle head-on at 50 to 60 miles an hour.  August 15, 2021: A car that was speeding and disregarding red traffic signals at 2:07 a.m. struck a Milwaukee County bus in the 2700 block of West Wisconsin Ave. The passenger of the car, a 38-year-old man, died from his injuries. The driver, a 28-year-old man, was hospitalized in stable condition after suffering life-threatening injuries.  August 15, 2021: A Milwaukee man and woman were killed in a crash after two vehicles were drag racing at North 76th Street and West Silver Spring Drive around 7:10 p.m. and one vehicle struck a vehicle that had not been racing. Inside that other vehicle was a 66-year-old Milwaukee man and a 21-year-old Milwaukee woman. Both died on scene, police said. August 29, 2021: A 16-year-old boy was killed and three other teens, ranging in age from 15 to 17, were critically injured in a single-vehicle crash when the driver lost control and struck a tree about 3:30 p.m. in the 3100 block of North 20th Street, police said. Footage from TV news stations shows the damaged car ended up on the grounds of Union Cemetery.  The second part of the claim is more straightforward. Johnson’s news release said more than 9,000 cars were stolen, double the amount in 2020.  According to Milwaukee Police Department Crime Maps and Statistics, there were 4,508 thefts of motor vehicles in 2020, and the total by year’s end in 2021 was 10,482, an increase of 133%. So he is on the money there. Johnson claimed that ""In 2021, 65 people in Milwaukee have lost their lives due to reckless driving accidents, and more than 9,000 cars have been stolen, double the amount in 2020."" Johnson was correct with the stolen vehicle part of the claim, but was off on the deaths due to reckless driving. The number cited by Johnson was for all traffic fatalities. The actual figures, according to Milwaukee police, are 38 reckless vehicle crashes resulted in 43 fatalities.  For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, our rating is Half True. ",/factchecks/2022/feb/04/cavalier-johnson/milwaukee-mayor-ballpark-stolen-vehicle-figures-ov/

Checking a claim that Facebook oversells the accuracy of climate change models
","People across the political spectrum are critical of the influence Facebook wields over the flow of information. Now, a blog that’s skeptical of humans’ impact on the climate says Facebook is putting a spin on the facts it puts in front of users. The blog, Watts Up With That, said in a recent post that ""Facebook is spamming all climate articles by misleading readers about temperature measurements."" This complaint is aimed at Facebook’s practice of placing a link to its Climate Science Center information page on posts that may deal with climate change. Here’s how the link shows up: The page is a collection of facts, charts and articles related to climate change science, along with links to sources of scientific information. ""These facts from climate researchers correct common misconceptions about global warming and its impact,"" it says. It covers a number of points, among them, the use of climate change models that scientists use to project changes in temperature and analyze other patterns. The Jan. 31 post on Watts Up With That takes issue with Facebook’s assertion that these models are reliable. It argues that Facebook leaves out information that would show you can’t really count on the models.  Is Facebook misleading the public about the accuracy of climate models? We took a look. (PolitiFact partners with Facebook to assess statements posted on its platform and receives payment for that work.) The models at issue are computer models that simulate weather patterns over time to help scientists project how overall conditions will change as more greenhouse gases get into the atmosphere. They apply the basic rules of physics, such as the conservation of energy and mass, to factors such as air temperature, pressure, wind patterns and more.  Each run of a model produces results from those calculations to estimate changes in temperatures, rainfall, ice cover and sea level around the globe. ""The way scientists predict changes in climate patterns has proven to be reliable,"" Facebook’s climate science page says, in a summary that cites NASA as a source.  It notes successes in predicting global temperature increases, the course of Arctic warming and the divergence between temperatures in the upper atmosphere and lower atmosphere.  Eric Porterfield, spokesman for Meta, the company that owns Facebook, said the climate change center aims to cite ""organizations that are coming to independent conclusions and are not politically swayed."" In addition to NASA, the center links to the National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration and the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. The page also addresses skeptics of the models. ""The myth that climate models are not reliable wrongly assumes that they are based on guesses and assumptions,"" it says. ""In fact, they’re based on the laws of physics and have proven records of accuracy."" The blog post from Watts Up accuses Facebook of failing to give readers complete information. It says the social media platform ""conceals"" cautionary words from international climate experts about climate forecasting.  For instance, it cites a passage from the 2013 IPCC report that says, ""The scenarios should be considered plausible and illustrative, and do not have probabilities attached to them."" The post characterizes this as saying the models are ""speculative."" The post goes on to say ""climate models grossly overstate global climate temperature anomaly impacts."" It provides a 2016 chart from a University of Alabama climatologist that shows the results of models for how rising greenhouse gas levels would affect temperatures in the tropical mid-troposphere, at least a mile above the Earth’s surface. The average temperatures predicted by the models were higher than actual observations from satellites and weather balloons. Both examples are misleading. The part of the 2013 report about ""illustrative scenarios"" was talking about the human factors that are always tough to predict, like whether future governments would clamp down on greenhouse gas emissions, or the pace of economic growth. Both would affect levels of atmospheric carbon, but they have nothing to do with the way the models themselves were built. As for the chart — versions of which appeared in a 2017 House hearing and circulate widely online — climate researchers have pointed out a number of flaws and limitations in it. High on the list of issues is the particular slice of the atmosphere it focuses on, the mid-troposphere, where temperatures are difficult to measure. Models for that part of the atmosphere did overshoot the actual temperatures, but not by as much as the chart suggests. Zeke Hausfather, a data scientist at the University of California Berkeley Energy and Resources Group, downplayed the chart’s significance. ""Models are not perfect, but it makes a lot more sense to evaluate their performance on surface temperatures for the globe where we all live, rather than cherry picking a layer of the atmosphere a mile up,"" Hausfather said. It’s much easier to measure temperatures at the surface, which means the data about surface temperatures is more accurate, and there are many more readings to draw on, compared with using satellites and balloons. Better data makes for better model performance. Hausfather co-wrote a study with NASA scientists that measured the results of 17 climate models of global average temperatures against actual readings. They found that 10 models were on target, and another four would have been, if they had known more precisely how much carbon dioxide pollution the global economy would produce. NASA’s page on climate models features this work. In addition, it cites older work by researchers who assessed the accuracy of the models used in 2004. They looked back (called a hindcast) to see how well the models’ results matched the past, and looked forward, to see how well they matched what actually happened after the model was run. The chart below shows the comparison. Remember, this is for average surface temperatures across the globe. The red line is observed temperatures. The black line is the average of the modeled results. The accuracy was generally good.  Source: NASA The IPCC has an ongoing program to assess the accuracy of climate change models.  In their latest report in 2021, IPCC researchers wrote that ""climate models have improved and continue to do so."" While some models do better than others, they found no broad pattern of overestimating or underestimating temperatures. ""Both the current and previous generations of models show that increases in greenhouse gases cause global warming,"" they said. We reached out to the Watts Up blog but did not hear back. The Watts Up With That blog said ""Facebook is spamming all climate articles by misleading readers about"" the accuracy of climate models. The article misrepresented cautionary words about climate change models from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. It shared a chart that relies on cherry picked data to undercut the reliability of models. The great majority of climate researchers worldwide have data that shows models do an increasingly good job of capturing temperature changes at the surface.

Charlie Crist overstates in claim about ‘millions’ of expired COVID-19 tests in Florida
","As COVID-19 deaths in Florida trended upward in late-January, Democratic gubernatorial candidate Charlie Crist attacked Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis over diagnostic tests that expired while stored in a state warehouse. In a video ad placed on Facebook and Instagram, Crist said DeSantis ""keeps pulling right-wing partisan political stunts in Florida, like letting millions of COVID-19 tests expire."" Crist represents Florida’s 13th Congressional district but is not seeking re-election in 2022. The former Republican previously served as the state’s governor.  DeSantis is running for a second gubernatorial term in 2022 and is seen as a contender for the 2024 GOP nomination for president. Florida Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried said on Dec. 30 that Florida had ""a significant number of COVID-19 tests stockpiled that are set to expire imminently."" Fried, another Democratic candidate for governor, called on DeSantis to release the tests immediately to cities and counties. We didn’t find any evidence that the expired tests numbered in the millions. When we asked Crist’s campaign about the ad, which began running Jan. 28, a spokesperson said Feb. 3 that ""millions"" was ""a typo"" and that the ad would be corrected. A new version of the ad, posted Feb. 3, says ""up to a million"" in the text, but the same video is used, in which Crist says ""millions."" Florida emergency management director Kevin Guthrie on Jan. 6 said the state had between 800,000 and 1 million rapid-test kits manufactured by Abbott in a warehouse ""that did expire"" earlier in 2021. DeSantis said the same day the tests were not distributed earlier in 2021 because of a lack of demand from testing sites. He also said they couldn’t be distributed in December — when Floridians were waiting in long lines at community testing sites — because state officials were waiting for federal approval for the tests to be used after their listed expiration. Florida began distributing the tests after a Jan. 7 approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Abbott and the federal government, in effect, gave Florida a three-month extension in September 2021 so that the tests would not be considered expired until late-December 2021, Guthrie said. Abbott made the extension request, as required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The FDA regularly grants requests to extend the shelf life of medical products if the products have been properly stored. But the tests remained in the warehouse after that initial extension. Guthrie said that before the tests expired in late-December, the state asked Abbott to request a second extension. The tests’ December expiration date passed before the FDA granted that additional extension on Jan. 7. On Jan. 12, DeSantis said at a news conference that the FDA’s second three-month extension meant the tests could be used by March 2022.  Florida Health Department spokesperson Jeremey Redfern told PolitiFact on Feb. 2 that 99% of the tests have been distributed to testing sites.  Crist said DeSantis let ""millions of COVID-19 tests expire."" Crist overstated the number of tests that expired, it was up to 1 million, not ""millions."" Crist’s statement leaves the impression that the tests were no longer usable. However, because the tests were stored safely, the FDA has allowed the tests to be used by March 2022. Nearly all tests have been distributed to testing sites, according to the state’s health department. DeSantis has acknowledged the tests twice passed their expiration dates in 2021. He attributed that to little demand from testing sites during most of the second half of 2021 and pending federal approval regarding the tests’ safety.  Crist’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin’s stance on filibuster shifts since 2012 and she now favors elimination
","The filibuster has been a hot topic in American politics over the last several years, with Democrats now the ones working to change – or even eliminate – a tactic that can be used to stall or kill measures that have majority support.  On Jan. 19, 2022, Democrats in the U.S. Senate were unsuccessful in overturning the filibuster in a move to pass a group of voting rights bills. The filibuster is a legislative maneuver that can be used by the minority party to prolong debate, delay or even prevent a vote on a bill or resolution in the Senate. It means, on any measure, supporters effectively need 60 votes to proceed. Over time, various carve outs were made. In 2013, Democrats eliminated the filibuster for votes on most federal judicial nominees in order to break a logjam during Barack Obama’s term. In 2017, Republicans eliminated it for U.S. Supreme Court nominees under President Donald Trump. In the January vote on overriding the filibuster to force a vote on voting rights legislation, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat from Wisconsin, was among those who supported its elimination.  In the weeks since, we’ve heard a question from PolitiFact Wisconsin readers: Has Baldwin flip-flopped on getting rid of the filibuster?  A reminder here: We use our Flip-O-Meter to evaluate whether a politician has been consistent  over time. The Flip-O-Meter does not examine if it is good policy or politics to make any change. Let’s start at the beginning of Baldwin’s time in the Senate.  After being elected in 2012, Baldwin signed on to co-sponsor legislation that aimed to reform the filibuster, according to a Jan. 22, 2013 news release from her office. The bill would have reinstated the ""talking filibuster,"" in which a senator would be required to physically go to the Senate floor and keep talking in order to maintain the filibuster delay. Under the plan, there would have also needed to be at least 41 votes to keep the filibuster going.  ""Recently, the threat of the filibuster has been used far too often and as a result political obstructionism in the United States Senate is now worse than it has ever been,"" Baldwin said in the release. ""The people of Wisconsin and our state’s progressive tradition deserve better.""  Though the bill didn’t pass, Baldwin has continued to take a stand on the filibuster, with a slight change: her stance has shifted from reformation to elimination.  In a June 23, 2021 report from WKOW-TV, after Republicans had blocked a voting rights bill from advancing, Baldwin called for the end of the maneuver.  She said she was in favor of eliminating it entirely, not just in narrower cases. The matter came to a head in the January 2022 vote, in which Badwin voted to end the filibuster. The measure did not pass, nor did an effort to create a carveout for voting-related measures, according to a Jan. 19, 2022 report from the New York Times, so there was no ultimate vote on the package itself. Baldwin started out her career with an aim to reform the filibuster, looking to eliminate what she called ""political gridlock"" in the Senate.  Since then, her stance has shifted away from reforms, to complete elimination of the tactic. In fact, Baldwin voted in support of eliminating the filibuster completely in January 2022.  We consider this a partial change in position, and rate it a Half Flip.  ",/factchecks/2022/feb/04/tammy-baldwin/us-sen-tammy-baldwins-stance-filibuster-shifts-201/

Fact-checking Stacey Abrams on a Texas mail-in ballot denial
","Stacey Abrams, a Democrat running for Georgia governor, said on CNN that state legislators are passing laws to undermine democracy and keep voters from the ballot box Abrams brought up a situation involving a Houston voter, Kenneth Thompson, who had been in the news for his attempts to get a mail ballot. ""In Texas because of the laws they passed, a 95-year-old World War II veteran is being denied the right to vote by mail because he can't produce a registration number he got back in the 1950s,"" Abrams said on CNN Jan. 31. She spoke prematurely. Thompson was eventually able to register to vote by mail, but it wasn’t easy. Thompson, who his daughter said has been voting since the 1940s, had to jump through hoops to apply for a mail ballot for the primary because of a new Texas law. It requires voters applying for mail ballots to provide ID information that matches that on their registration. That was a problem for Thompson because he registered to vote decades ago, back when the registration rules didn’t require such ID. A spokesperson for Abrams’ campaign, Seth Bringman, said the fact that Thompson will maybe be able to vote by mail after being denied twice, his daughter calling election officials and having to update his registration ""is the definition of a denial of his right."" ""The hope that his right is restored after overcoming even more obstacles, and an assumption that everything will work out in the end, does not change that he is being denied this right, and is exactly the type of procedural hurdle — and mindset of those placing the procedural hurdles — applied throughout history to deny the right to vote, especially in states like Texas with a long history of discrimination,"" Bringman said. In 2021, the Texas state Legislature passed a sweeping new elections law that requires voters applying for a mail ballot to include identifying numbers such as those on their driver’s license, state ID or the last four digits of their Social Security Number. If the number doesn’t match the number on file in their voter registration record — or if there is no such number on file — the application for a mail ballot must be rejected. The March 1 primary is the first statewide election under the new law.  The provision has created a lot of confusion, including for voters who don’t remember what ID information they put on their registration — or, if in a case such as Thompson’s, they lack ID information on their registration. As of Jan. 29, Harris County rejected about 10% of mail ballot applications due to the new ID rules.  Thompson’s daughter, Delinda Holland, told PolitiFact that her father filled out an application for a mail ballot in January. When she called Harris County to check on the status, she was told that it was rejected because he didn’t include his driver’s license number, she said. Thompson applied again, and his second application was rejected, too. She then contacted the Secretary of State’s office, where she was directed to have her father re-register.  Harris County elections spokesperson Leah Shah told us that the earliest voter registration record they have for Thompson is from 1976, when the office computerized records. ""He has lived at the same voting precinct the entire 95 years,"" Holland said. After being rejected for a mail ballot, Thompson updated his registration with ID information. Holland sent us a screengrab from the elections office mail ballot tracker showing that his mail ballot application was accepted Jan. 28 and that the ballot was being processed Jan. 29.  The Secretary of State’s office has advised county officials and voters in similar situations to update their voter registration records, said Sam Taylor, a spokesperson for the secretary. As of Dec. 20, there were approximately 100,000 registered Texas voters that had neither identification number on their voter registration record out of more than 17.1 million registered voters, Taylor said. Holland said it’s easier for her father to vote at home than go to the polls, but he will vote in person if that’s his only option. But they both expressed concern that other senior citizens in the same situation may not have a way to sort through the bureaucracy to ensure their ability to vote by mail. ""I’ve been voting for many, many years, and I’ve never missed a vote,"" Thompson told an NBC-affiliated television station in Houston. ""I can get out and move around and go to a regular polling place, but there are lots of people that can’t."" Holland said her father, a World War II Army veteran, instilled in his children and grandchildren that they must vote.  ""You vote, it’s not an option — it’s something you do,"" Holland said. Abrams said, ""In Texas because of the laws they passed, a 95-year-old World War II veteran is being denied the right to vote by mail because he can't produce a registration number, he got back in the 1950s.""  Thompson, the veteran, registered to vote in Houston decades ago when citizens didn’t have to provide ID. He applied for a mail ballot twice in January and received two denial letters. A new state law that requires the ID on a mail ballot application to match that on their registration record. Thompson ended up submitting updated ID information for his voter registration and it appears his application was accepted Jan. 28 and processed Jan. 29. Abrams made her statements after it had been reported that Thompson had re-registered. And there is still time for him to get a mail ballot for the March 1 primary, so Abrams’ comments were premature. But the situation was a new challenge for a man who says he has been successfully voting for decades.

CBS News reported on Feb. 1 that the Biden administration has focused on infrastructure spending, and that some economists have said that the previous stimulus payments have led to inflation.  A senior fellow with the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, a Washington, D.C., think tank that  follows federal economic policy, said that more stimulus payments are not on the way.  Congress has not enacted a fourth round of economic impact payments, also known as stimulus payments, said Janet Holtzblatt. In addition, a fourth round was not included in the Build Back Better legislation, part of Biden’s domestic agenda, which is stalled.   While there are no imminent plans for a fourth stimulus check at the federal level, some states, such as California and Maine, plan to or have recently distributed these payments. The states have different eligibility guidelines, according to a USA Today report in December. In Arizona, a $2,000 one-time bonus was available to people who were unemployed and returned to the workforce. In January, CNBC reported that states have federal funds that they need to distribute, and those distributions could take different forms, such as paid sick or family leave.  Another payment to Americans, the Child Tax Credit, does not appear to be coming back either. Biden said in a news conference with reporters on Jan. 19 that he is not sure he can get it into the Build Back Better legislation. Parents of children born in 2021 can still be eligible for the credit if they did not get it in 2021, according to the IRS.  There has been no movement in Congress to authorize a fourth stimulus check amid the pandemic. Americans did not receive stimulus payments on Jan. 19, and there is no evidence that they will be distributed anytime soon.  We rate this False.

Facebook post wrongly says Pennsylvania mail-ballot court ruling means Biden lost
","A Pennsylvania court ruled that a 2019 change to the state’s mail-in voting rules was unconstitutional, prompting social media users to distort the ruling to falsely suggest that Joe Biden lost the battleground state in 2020. ""Pennsylvania had 2.6 million mail in votes that the court of appeals of PA held to be unconstitutional. Umm that alone means Biden lost PA. Will anything be done about this?"" states a Jan. 28 Facebook post, the same day as the court ruling. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post misstates what the ruling says, and what it means. ""Think of it this way: The court held the law to be unconstitutional, not the votes,"" said Bruce Ledewitz, an expert on the state and federal constitutions at Duquesne University School of Law in Pittsburgh. If the author of the post is asking whether anything will be done related to Biden’s victory, the answer is no. Biden beat Donald Trump in Pennsylvania by about 80,000 votes, and the results were certified by the state and accepted by Congress. That final outcome still stands, regardless of the court ruling. In October 2019, the Republican-led Pennsylvania General Assembly passed Act 77, which added no-excuse voting by mail, a provision pushed by Democrats. Republicans got one of their priorities included, too: elimination of straight-ticket voting.  Amid the pandemic in 2020, mail-in voting was a popular choice in Pennsylvania, where about 2.6 million cast their ballots by mail in the presidential election. Before and after Election Day, Trump and his allies spread falsehoods about mail-in voting, wrongly suggesting it was rife with fraud. After Trump lost, U.S. Rep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., and co-plaintiffs filed a case against state officials arguing that the Legislature illegally adopted an expansion of mail-in voting in Act 77 because it required a constitutional amendment. Kelly asked the court to block the certification of Pennsylvania’s presidential election results, or direct the GOP-controlled state Legislature to choose electors.  The state Supreme Court dismissed the petition as untimely, writing that the plaintiffs filed their case more than a year after Act 77 was enacted and as the final ballots ""were being tallied, with the results becoming seemingly apparent."" They did not rule on the merits of the law, or mail-in voting. The latest ruling stemmed from consolidated cases brought by Bradford County Commissioner Doug McLinko and multiple Republican representatives. The Commonwealth Court of Pennsylvania didn’t rule on the merits of mail-in voting, but decided 3-2 to strike down the law. The judges said that if lawmakers want to change the rules for mail-in voting, they have to put it before the voters as a constitutional amendment. The judges wrote that ""no-excuse mail-in voting makes the exercise of the franchise more convenient"" and that if presented to the people, it is ""likely to be adopted.""  The three judges in the majority who found the mail-in voting law unconstitutional are Republicans, while the two judges who dissented are Democrats. The Facebook post is wrong to suggest that the ruling means anything for the 2.6 million ballots cast or the election outcome, said David Schultz, professor of political science and legal studies at Hamline University in St. Paul, Minnesota. ""It merely says going forward, if the Legislature wants to do this, they are going to have to go by route of constitutional amendment,"" Schultz said. ""Congress has validated the results. No matter what the court said it can’t overturn the Pennsylvania election because Congress essentially said, ‘This is our count. We have accepted the electoral votes in Pennsylvania cast for Joe Biden.’""  Pennsylvania’s governor, attorney general and Department of State appealed the ruling to the state Supreme Court, which means the appellate court’s ruling is on hold.  A Facebook post said, ""Pennsylvania had 2.6 million mail in votes that the court of appeals of PA held to be unconstitutional. Umm that alone means Biden lost PA. Will anything be done about this?""  A court ruled in January that the state’s passage of a law to allow no-excuse voting by mail was unconstitutional, and that such a change would require a constitutional amendment. But the court did not toss out the mail ballots cast or the election results, which were already accepted by Congress.  The ruling on the voting law is on hold pending an appeal, so the fate of the law remains unclear. But we do know that this fact stands: Biden won Pennsylvania. We rate this statement False.  ",/factchecks/2022/feb/03/facebook-posts/facebook-post-wrongly-says-pennsylvania-mail-ballo/

It’s not true that Donald Trump never left the White House
","There’s a brand of misinformation that spreads widely on social media that falsely suggests Donald Trump is not the former president, but the current one. We’ve checked some of it, such as this claim that Trump signed the Insurrection Act and is still president, or that he was secretly inaugurated as the president of the ""restored Republic.""  Neither statement is accurate, and neither is the title of this video shared on Facebook on Feb. 2. ""Trump is in position,"" it says. ""He never left.""  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The video offers no evidence to support this claim. While Trump is active in politics — issuing statements, holding rallies, giving interviews — he is no longer the president. He left the White House on Jan. 20, 2021, and hasn’t returned.

Photo shows a 2021 pileup in Fort Worth, Texas, not a crash in Eminence, Indiana
","With wintry weather striking many regions of the United States, photos are emerging from across the country showing snow plows, icy roads, and big drifts of snow.  But one old picture is being mischaracterized as showing the aftermath of a crash in Eminence, Indiana.  ""This is currently at state road 42 and state road 142 in downtown Eminence, Indiana,"" a Feb. 2 post says, alongside a photo of a treacherous-looking pileup of cars and trucks. ""Black ice! Drive safe folks! Right by the Citizens Bank and Dairyland. Prayers to all involved.""  But this photo was taken last year, and about 900 miles southwest of Eminence.  This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Photographer Lawrence Jenkins took it on Feb. 11, 2021, in Fort Worth, Texas, where 133 vehicles crashed after freezing rain coated the roads there, sending dozens of people to the hospital and leaving at least six dead, the Dallas Morning News reported at the time.  North Texas and Central Indiana are both experiencing wintry weather, but this photo doesn’t show it.  We rate this miscaptioned post False. ",/factchecks/2022/feb/03/facebook-posts/photo-shows-2021-pileup-fort-worth-texas-not-crash/
