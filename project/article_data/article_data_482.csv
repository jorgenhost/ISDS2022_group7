Has construction 'already started' on Trump’s border wall in San Diego?
","Amid chants of ""Build the Wall!"" at a recent rally in Nevada, President Trump repeated the claim that construction has ""already started"" on the border wall in California. Here’s what Trump said, in context, at the Nevada rally on June 23, 2018: ""We have to have strong borders. We’re going to have the (border) wall. We’re gonna have the wall. We’ve already started it ....  (Audience cheers) ""We’ve already started it. You know, we started it in San Diego."" (Audience chants: ""Build that Wall! Build that Wall! Build that Wall!"")  ""Now we’re gonna have the wall. And we started it. We have $1.6 billion. We’ve started it. We’re fixing it. And we’re building new. And we’re starting it. … We’re getting the wall built.""  Has construction really started on Trump’s signature campaign promise: Building ""a big, beautiful wall,"" on the U.S.-Mexico border? Trump has made similar statements in the past. In this fact check, we’ll focus on his claim: ""We’ve already started (the border wall). We started it in San Diego.""  President Trump made his claim during a rally in Nevada on June 23, 2018.  Projects at the border There are projects underway to replace fencing along the border in San Diego and further east in Calexico. Those call for new and taller, bollard-style barriers, which include a comb-like array of steel posts that border patrol agents can see through, some of which were planned long before Trump ran for office. A recent appropriation by Congress of $1.6 billion allows for the replacement of the old fencing, but not for the construction of any sort of concrete wall prototype as Trump requested. ""The one thing we don’t fund is the one issue we all campaigned on — a border security wall — and that is not in the legislation,"" Republican Rep. Jim Jordan, founder of the House Freedom Caucus, said of the omnibus bill, according to an April article by FactCheck.org. In San Diego, the project underway will replace 14 miles of scrap metal fencing that’s now eight-to-10 feet high with the bollard-style barrier. That replacement will be 18-to-30 feet in height and include an anti-climbing plate, according to a U.S. Customs and Border Protection news release announcing the start of construction on June 1, 2018. The press release calls it the third ""border wall construction project,"" which is misleading.   That’s because none of the projects that have already started will produce the solid, 30-foot high concrete barrier Trump promised during his 2016 presidential campaign. More specifically, they won’t include any of the eight border wall prototype designs ordered by the Trump administration. ""... this isn’t Trump’s wall"" The same goes for the 2.25-mile barrier replacement project east of San Diego in Calexico. ""First and foremost, this isn’t Trump’s wall,"" Jonathan Pacheco, a spokesman for the Border Patrol’s El Centro Sector, which includes Calexico, told the Los Angeles Times in March 2018. ""This isn’t the infrastructure that Trump is trying to bring in. … This new wall replacement has absolutely nothing to do with the prototypes that were shown over in the San Diego area."" Plans for the Calexico project, which also include a bollard-style structure, began in 2009 under the Obama administration and were funded in 2017, under Trump, according to the Times. A spokesman for the Border Patrol’s San Diego Sector said they could not specify when planning started for the San Diego project. ""These were funded under FY2017 so planning was before or during that time,"" Ralph DeSio, the agency’s San Diego-based spokesman, wrote in an email. The White House did not respond to a request for evidence supporting the president’s statement. The reality of what’s being built at these sites, and how it differs from Trump’s campaign promise, hasn’t stopped the president from distorting the facts. In April, PolitiFact National rated Mostly False Trump’s similar statement: ""We’ve started building the wall."" It found Trump’s words ""leave the impression that construction is underway for the border wall he promised, and that $1.6 billion is helping pay for it. That’s not the case."" It concluded that ""it’s disingenuous to claim"" the projects underway ""amount to the border wall Trump has long promised."" Our ruling President Trump recently claimed: ""We’ve already started (the border wall). We started it in San Diego."" His statement gives the wrong impression that border fence replacement projects in California, including those in San Diego and Calexico, are the same as the solid, 30-foot-high concrete wall he promised during his run for president. The $1.6 billion authorized by Congress for these projects does not allow for the construction of any sort of wall prototype requested by Trump. Instead, the projects underway include arrays of steel posts, between 18 and 30 feet high, that allow border patrol agents to see through. The planning for at least some of these projects, which will replace shorter scrap metal fencing, started long before Trump ran for office. Congress, however, agreed to pay for them under Trump’s administration. We also grant that Trump at the Nevada rally added: ""We’re fixing it. And we’re building new."" This could be interpreted as a slight acknowledgement that the projects aren’t exactly what he promised, but they don’t add much clarity to what overall is a misleading statement. We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBDB8240>],/factchecks/2018/jun/26/donald-trump/has-construction-already-started-trumps-border-wal/

Did Patrick Morrisey join a lawsuit to allow insurers to deny coverage for pre-existing conditions?
","Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia -- a vulnerable Democratic Senator in a state that Donald Trump won by more than 40 points in 2016 -- is accusing his Republican opponent of seeking to take away health insurance protections for people who have pre-existing conditions. In a tweet, Manchin said that Patrick Morrisey, the state’s elected attorney general and the GOP’s nominee for the Senate seat, ""joined a federal lawsuit to allow insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions."" West Virginians are outraged to learn Pat Morrisey joined a federal lawsuit to allow insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Today, Manchin's campaign launched https://t.co/6W6SsQo3xb to give the people of WV the chance to speak out. #wvsen Historically, getting rid of pre-existing condition protections is an unpopular view. A March 2018 poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, found that 84 percent of Democrats, 68 percent of independents and 59 percent of Republicans favor keeping insurers from charging people with pre-existing conditions more for health insurance, which is the existing policy under Obama’s 2010 health care law. Indeed, Manchin tweeted about the issue several other times recently and launched an online petition effort. So is Manchin correct that Morrisey ""joined a federal lawsuit to allow insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions""? Pretty much, yes. Manchin is referring to a lawsuit filed in a U.S. district court in Texas on Feb. 26, 2018. The lawsuit was signed by 18 attorneys general and two governors, all of them Republicans. The suit challenges the Affordable Care Act, arguing that ""the ACA is unlawful"" and seeking to enjoin, or block, its operation. One of the attorney generals who signed onto the lawsuit is Morrisey:  He is listed as a signatory on a court document in the case dated as recently as June 20, 2018, or two days before Manchin's tweet. We could not find any subsequent statement by Morrisey that he had withdrawn his support for the legal action.  Here’s the gist of the lawsuit’s argument. In 2012, the Supreme Court upheld the law’s individual mandate to purchase health insurance by saying it was enforced by a tax penalty. But in 2017, Congress repealed the mechanism to enforce the individual mandate through the tax code. The lawsuit contends that -- with the tax penalty now gone -- the individual mandate is no longer constitutional and, as a result, the law should be either largely or entirely thrown out. Yes, say health policy specialists. ""There would be much more damage beyond the issue of people with health problems being denied coverage, but that would in fact be one outcome,"" said Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute. Blumberg said that if you got rid of insurance regulations like those in the ACA and then tried to require insurers to cover all comers -- a policy known as ""guaranteed issue"" -- then ""insurers would respond by setting their premiums so high"" that they’d be out of reach for most customers, and/or ""offer extremely high deductibles and other types of out-of-pocket requirements."" The impact of a court ruling would take time to filter through the health insurance system, but the scale is potentially large. A Kaiser Family Foundation analysis found that ""52 million non-elderly adults had pre-existing conditions that would have made them uninsurable prior to passage of the ACA."" ""Manchin is addressing what is probably the major implication of the lawsuit,"" rather than just ""a detail,"" said Christine Eibner, health policy analyst with the RAND Corp. Usually, the federal government would defend an existing law in court, but the Trump administration has decided to take the attorney generals’ side in the case. Morrrisey's camp fired back at what it said was the implication of Manchin's tweet -- that Morrisey opposes protections for pre-existing conditions. He doesn't, and he wants them restored in whatever comes next. While Morrisey believes that law should be repealed, ""help should be provided to those who need it most, including those with pre-existing conditions,"" said Nathan Brand, a spokesman for the Morrisey campaign.  It’s worth noting that the lawsuit is still a long way from success. ""My guess is that the Supreme Court may take a pass on this, and for sure it won’t be going anywhere before the 2018 elections,"" said Gail Wilensky, who headed Medicare and Medicaid under President George H.W. Bush. That said, Manchin’s tweet didn’t say that pre-existing condition protections are going to be eliminated immediately. Rather, he tweeted that Morrisey had joined a lawsuit that sought that end. Manchin said, ""Pat Morrisey joined a federal lawsuit to allow insurance companies to deny coverage for people with pre-existing conditions."" Morrisey told PolitiFact that he supports some form of protection for those with pre-existing conditions. Nevertheless, Morrisey did join a lawsuit filed by numerous state Republican officials that asks a court to rule all or part of the 2010 health care law unconstitutional and to prevent the enactment of rules, regulations or other actions under the law. Various health-policy specialists agreed that such a decision from the court would effectively eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions. The statement ia accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9FC480>],/factchecks/2018/jun/26/joe-manchin/did-patrick-morrisey-join-lawsuit-allow-insurers-d/
"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Wolf Blitzer']","
Majority of undocumented immigrants show up for court, data shows
","Defenders of President Donald Trump’s aggressive approach to illegal U.S.-Mexico border crossings say the country faces a binary choice: hold offenders in detention centers while their cases are adjudicated, or allow them to fall off immigration authorities’ radar. The argument hinges on the belief that undocumented border-crossers released from federal custody are more likely to skip court and abscond than show up for mandatory court hearings. This rationale led the Trump administration to hold border-crossers in detention facilities without the possibility of being released on bond, in a break with the previous administration’s so-called ""catch-and-release"" practice. The acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement Thomas Homan pressed the ""no show"" argument on CNN’s Situation Room, before anchor Wolf Blitzer pushed back. ""They'll say the right thing to get released from detention, then they won't show up in court,"" Homan said June 19. ""But they're already in the United States. They're lost in society. They never get removed. So as long as we send the world this message — ‘Come and say the right thing, get released, never to show up in court’ — you're never going to fix this."" Blitzer countered, ""Most of them do show up in court. They don't necessarily disappear."" Immigrants’ purported low court attendance rate has become a popular talking point, from Trump himself (""When we release the people, they never come back to the judge, anyway — they're gone""), to White House staff and law enforcement officials, to the administration’s conservative media allies.   In absolute terms, more than 100,000 non-detained immigrants have been ordered to be deported in recent years because they failed to appear before an immigration judge. However, as a percentage, most undocumented immigrants do show up for court. According to Justice Department data from the last five available years, around 60 to 75 percent of non-detained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings. That’s determined by subtracting the percentage of judgments entered against migrants in their absence (known as an in absentia ruling) from total judgments entered. So Blitzer is right, in percentage terms: Most of them do show up in court. But it’s worth noting that in absolute terms, that’s nearly 140,000 non-detained immigrants who were ordered to be deported between 2012-16 because they were not present in the courtroom, according to Justice Department data. (Though some immigration advocates say that count is high.)  ""On the overall question of the importance immigration officials should attach to no-shows: the glass is either half full or half empty,"" said Peter Margulies, an immigration law and national security law professor at Roger Williams University School of Law. Despite a majority attending their hearings, he said, ""that still yields a significant number of no-shows (and) noncitizens unaccounted for."" Several experts emphasized that using monitoring devices and providing immigrants with legal counsel correlated with higher attendance. ""I do think having appropriate legal representation for asylum claimants would help a lot,"" Margulies said. ""Many may not know that they have good claims. Better legal advice would further improve the attendance rate."" As the CNN transcript shows, Homan and Blitzer were discussing asylees, so it’s worth distinguishing that group from other migrants. Asylum-seekers flee to the United States out of fear of persecution in their home country due to race, religion, nationality, or because their social or political activities have put a target on their back. One example is the case of an asylee identified in court documents only as M.G.U., who is suing the Trump administration in relation to its family separation policy. M.G.U. fled Guatemala with her three minor-age sons after her husband received death threats for his community organizing efforts there, according the lawsuit. M.G.U. and her sons appeared at the San Ysidro, Calif., port of entry in May to request asylum due to their fear of returning to Guatemala. As a technical matter, M.G.U. and her family’s case is considered an ""affirmative"" application for asylum because the applicants went to U.S. authorities to make the request. In contrast, undocumented migrants requesting asylum during a deportation proceeding make a ""defensive"" application. In either case, immigrants must be found to have a credible fear of persecution to be considered for asylum. As we’ve noted before, there’s been a nearly 1,700 percent increase in U.S. asylum claims over the last 10 years. What’s fueling the increase is growing instability, gang violence and worsening economic conditions in Central America’s ""Northern Triangle"" countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. ""Initially, a lot of migration was single males from Mexico coming for work,"" said Joshua Breisblatt, a senior policy analyst at the American Immigration Council. ""Now you’re seeing a shift to Central American families fleeing record levels of violence in the Northern Triangle."" So what do the court attendance rates of asylees look like? While the data is scarce, they show higher rates, compared to when all migrants are tallied together. One source of data comes from an Obama-era program that released asylees from detention and matched them with case managers who encouraged compliance with court-ordered obligations. As of April, the Family Case Management Program, or FCMP, had 630 enrolled families. Before the Trump administration ended the program in June, participants had a 100 percent attendance record at court hearings. They also had a 99 percent rate of check-ins and appointments with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, according to a Department of Homeland Security Office of Inspector General report. ""According to ICE, overall program compliance for all five regions is an average of 99 percent for ICE check-ins and appointments, as well as 100 percent attendance at court hearings,"" the report said. ""Since the inception of FCMP, 23 out of 954 participants (2 percent) were reported as absconders."" In 2015, the immigration advocacy group American Immigration Council published a report that looked at studies from over the previous two decades that examined how well asylum seekers fulfilled their legal obligations. It found studies showed ""very high rates of compliance with proceedings by asylum seekers who were placed into alternatives to detention."" The report cited a 2000 U.S. government-commissioned study that found an ""83 percent rate of compliance with court proceedings among asylum seekers who were found to have a credible fear in the expedited removal process."" It also showed an 84 percent compliance rate among asylees under minimal supervision, and 78 percent among those who were unsupervised. A 2013 study sponsored by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees that looked at asylees in Toronto and Geneva noted a ""cooperative predisposition"" among asylum seekers. While the study did not look specifically at U.S.-bound asylees, it cited characteristics common among asylees, including an ""inclination towards law-abidingness,"" perhaps in relation to having fled home counties lacking in rule of law. It also noted asylum-seekers ""lack of a plan B"" due to the ""impossibility of returning home."" Blitzer said ""most (immigrants) do show up in court."" Around 60-75 percent of non-detained migrants have attended their immigration court proceedings, according to Justice Department data from the last five available years. Some limited data suggests rates may be higher for asylum-seekers. That said, it’s important to note that in absolute terms, a significant number of migrants have had in absentia deportation orders filed against them for failure to appear in court, which Blitzer’s statement overlooks. We rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC88D00>],/factchecks/2018/jun/26/wolf-blitzer/majority-undocumented-immigrants-show-court-data-s/

""After 2 car accidents in 4 days, one of which injured a father and took the life of his 7-month old baby before the car drove into a house, a Somali native has been arrested, charged, and convicted of aggravated vehicular homicide and was then let free to roam around until her sentencing hearing,"" the story said, adding that the woman, Muhuba Mohamed of Columbus, Ohio, was driving on a temporary permit at the time of the accident.

"['Immigration', 'Florida', 'Adam Putnam']","
Do Florida taxpayers pay tens of millions of dollars a year on undocumented immigrants in prison?
","In an interview with Fox News, Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam outlined his approach to illegal immigration if elected governor of Florida. Florida has to act, Putnam said, because illegal immigration comes at a steep cost. Putnam touted his Secure Florida First Agenda, which includes establishing a community deportation system with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""In other words, Florida should have that relationship with ICE because Florida taxpayers are sick of paying tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens who ought to be in the custody of the feds and oughta be deported,"" Putnam said June 7. The economic impact of immigration is widely debated, so we wanted to take a look at Putnam’s statement. We found it’s uncertain how much money ""illegal"" immigrants in Florida prisons cost taxpayers. That’s because Florida doesn’t keep tabs on whether inmates are in the country legally or illegally. Putnam campaign spokeswoman Meredith Beatrice said that there are two ways to calculate the ""tens of millions"" dollar figure he is referring to. The problem, though, is that his calculation for ""illegal immigrants"" includes inmates who are not U.S. citizens but are in the country legally. Putnam’s team multiplied the total state Department of Corrections budget ($2.3 billion) by the percent of ""criminal illegal aliens"" in Florida’s prisons, which Putnam said was 4.8 percent. That 4.8 percent of Corrections budget is roughly $110 million. In the second calculation, Putnam multiplied the average cost to incarcerate an inmate for a day ($55.80, according to the Florida Department Of Corrections) by the number of days in a year. Then he multiplied that total ($20,367) by the number of ""criminal illegal immigrants"" in Florida prisons, which he said was 4,754. That works out to around $96.8 million. But terminology matters. Putnam is referring to that 4,754 figure as all ""illegal aliens,"" but in fact the state prison system labels them simply ""aliens."" That might sound like a small difference, but it isn’t. The term ""aliens"" actually refers to all people who are not U.S. citizens, those who arrived both legally and illegally. The state of Florida only keeps a count of all aliens. According to the Florida Department of Corrections, ""the vast majority of alien inmates"" are released to ICE for further immigration processing, including possible deportation. It's possible undocumented immigrants make up a good share of the ""alien"" population, but Putnam still would have no way of knowing the exact numbers. ""If the state of Florida doesn’t track illegal immigrants in prison (they don’t) then that number is not knowable,"" said Cato analyst Alex Nowrasteh. Another problem is that even if 4.8 percent of the prison population were released from the prison system, it does not mean it would have a direct 4.8 percent reduction on the total budget because of fixed costs, such as the cost to keep a prison running and administrative and security costs. Bryce Peterson, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, said that reducing a small number of people from the prison will only really reduce the cost of clothing, food and direct health care service to that individual. ""If they were to release all 5 percent of those people that’s probably not going to be enough to start laying off people and closing prison,"" Peterson said. ""It's unrealistic to think it's going to have a direct five percent impact on their total budget."" Putnam said Florida taxpayers ""pay tens of millions of dollars a year to feed and house in our prison system criminal illegal aliens."" Putnam's estimates for how much undocumented immigrants in prisons cost Florida taxpayers have several major problems. For starters, the state only tracks inmates who are not U.S. citizens, without diving into whether they are in the country legally or illegally. Even if we had the right numbers, experts told us that fixed costs for the prisons mean reducing the population yields uncertain cost savings. Eliminating a small percentage of inmates doesn’t mean the overall prison budget can be reduced by the same percentage. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC05680>],/factchecks/2018/jun/26/adam-putnam/do-florida-taxpayers-pay-tens-millions-dollars-yea/

(Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The photo of the Honduran girl in McAllen Texas was taken by John Moore, a Pulitzer Prize-winning photographer for Getty Images. Moore joined a Border Patrol agent, Carlos Ruiz, for a ride along on the border June 12. Moore took a photo of the girl crying next to her mother when they were detained by federal agents near the U.S.-Mexico border, and the cutline distributed by Getty said that the mother and her daughter were detained ""before being sent to a processing center for possible separation."" Time then created a photo illustration using the image of the crying girl and a photo of Trump with the headline ""Welcome to America."" The photo came to symbolize Trump’s since-reversed policy that led to separating immigrant children from their parents at the border. But it also came to symbolize how viral images on social media can be used to create misleading impressions. The girl’s father, Denis Javier Varela Hernandez, told reporters that the girl and her mother have been detained together and were not separated. Honduran deputy foreign minister Nelly Jerez confirmed Valera’s version of events to Reuters. In an interview with CBS News, Ruiz said agents asked the mother, Sandra Sanchez, to put down her daughter, nearly 2-year-old Yanela, so they could search the mother. ""I personally went up to the mother and asked her, 'Are you doing okay? Is the kid okay?' and she said, 'Yes. She's tired and thirsty. It's 11 o'clock at night,"" Ruiz told CBS News.

As soon as the search was finished, she immediately picked the girl up, and the girl immediately stopped crying."" Time interviewed Moore about taking the photographs at the border. Time posted a correction to that story June 19: ""The original version of this story misstated what happened to the girl in the photo after she was taken from the scene. The girl was not carried away screaming by U.S. Border Patrol agents; her mother picked her up and the two were taken away together."" However, Time stood by the cover story. ""The June 12 photograph of the 2-year-old Honduran girl became the most visible symbol of the ongoing immigration debate in America for a reason: Under the policy enforced by the administration, prior to its reversal this week, those who crossed the border illegally were criminally prosecuted, which in turn resulted in the separation of children and parents. Our cover and our reporting capture the stakes of this moment,"" Time's editor-in-chief Edward Felsenthal said in a statement to CNN published June 22. Moore told the Washington Post that Time corrected the story after he made a request minutes after it was published. He said that the picture ""is a straightforward and honest image"" showing a ""distressed little girl"" whose mother was being searched by border officials. Moore said on Instagram that the girl and mother were taken into custody together and held at a detention center in Dilley, Texas. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released a statement to the media that said Sanchez, 32, was arrested by border patrol on June 12 near Hidalgo, Texas. On June 17, 2018, Sanchez was transferred to ICE custody, and is currently housed at the South Texas Family Residential Center in Dilley, Texas. Her immigration proceedings are ongoing. A headline by The Gateway Pundit said ""Migrant mother and ‘crying girl’ on Time cover never separated."" A Getty photographer took a photo of a girl crying when her mother was detained by the Border Patrol. The girl’s father, as well as a Border Patrol agent, confirmed that the girl and her mother were not separated. The agent said they were separated for a few minutes while the mother was searched. Time published a correction in a story in which the photographer was interviewed stating that the girl was not carried away by agents and the two were taken away together.

Ad falsely accuses Nevada's GOP governor candidate Laxalt of caving to drug makers
","For about two weeks in June, the Nevada chapter of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, or AFSCME, had a television ad up in the Las Vegas and Reno markets. At a cost of over half a million dollars, the ad from the union of government workers skewered Republican gubernatorial candidate Adam Laxalt for cozying up to drug companies. In 2017, Nevada passed a law to help put a lid on rising diabetes drug prices. Two major pharmaceutical trade groups sued to block it. Attorney General Laxalt’s office has been defending the measure and the AFSCME ad said he slacked off. ""Laxalt tried to cut a deal with big pharma instead of standing up for us, and drug prices continue to rise,"" the ad said. ""Adam Laxalt delivered for drug companies, not for us."" Legally, it is premature to say Laxalt delivered for anybody, because both sides are waiting for a judge to rule. In the same vein, the law won’t fully kick in until Jan. 15, 2019, so it is too early to fault it for not controlling drug prices. That leaves whether Laxalt ""tried to cut a deal with big pharma"" as the key claim to check. AFSCME sent us their supporting evidence. It was a September court filing that said the two sides had failed to settle before bringing the matter before a judge. (The defendant in the case is Nevada Gov. Brian Sandoval. The plaintiffs are the drug trade associations Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and Biotechnology Innovation Organization. ) ""The parties’ counsel discussed a potential resolution to avoid this motion,"" the filing said. ""But on Sept. 12, 2017, defendants’ counsel advised that defendant Sandoval would prefer that plaintiffs proceed with the filing of a motion."" To AFSCME, the discussion of a ""resolution"" amounted to trying to cut a deal. But that interpretation goes way beyond what the words mean, University of Nevada law professor Thomas Main told us. ""That sort of phrasing is common in these filings,"" Main said. ""I wouldn't read much, or anything, into that alone."" Main noted that state and federal court rules require both sides to try to settle out of court. Basically, if the parties can avoid tying up court time, they should do so. The rules say the parties must talk to each other and if they fail to come to terms, they must certify that they ""were unable to resolve or narrow the dispute without court intervention."" And that’s what the words in the court filing do. Interestingly, Laxalt’s campaign staff pointed to the same words in the same document to show that he didn’t cut a deal with the drug company representatives. If he had, the case would have settled, and it hasn’t. A union health fund attempted to join the suit on the side of the state on the grounds that Laxalt hadn’t filed a vigorous response to the drug makers’ suit. The judge in the case turned the group down. The AFSCME ad puts Laxalt at the center of the discussions with the drug trade groups. Actually, he left that to others in his office. Laxalt spokesman Parker Briden told us that he hadn’t participated, and a Deputy Attorney General confirmed that. He was not on the phone calls with the drug company lawyers. That further undercuts the assertion that he tried to cut a deal. The union noted that Laxalt received campaign contributions from drug maker Eli Lilly. Eli Lilly gave $3,100. The company sells drugs for treating diabetes covered by the state’s pricing transparency law. An ad from the AFSCME union said Laxalt tried to cut a deal with drug makers. The only evidence that Laxalt’s office attempted to settle a suit brought by drug trade groups is a court filing that certifies that the parties failed to come to terms. That interpretation ignores that court rules require the parties to see if they can settle out of court, and to certify that they tried and and failed. The ad puts far too much weight on legal boilerplate, a Nevada law professor said. On top of that, Laxalt did not personally participate in those early discussions between his office and the drug makers’ lawyers. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9D5CC0>],/factchecks/2018/jun/25/afscme/ad-falsely-accuses-nevadas-gop-governor-candidate-/

Did Obama detain illegal Mexican children as an experiment?
","Public outcry over President Donald Trump’s now-terminated family separation policy inspired several defenses of the practice, with many conservative politicians and pundits arguing that it was a continuation of policies from earlier administrations. According to one blog site, Trump’s policy was no worse than a pilot program put in place under President Barack Obama. ""Obama administration kept illegal Mexican kids in detention camps as ‘experiment,’"" said a June 16, 2018 headline from the Lid, an online blog. Facebook flagged this story as part of its efforts to combat false news and misinformation on Facebook's News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Citing a Feb. 11, 2015, report from the Washington Post, the Lid story compared Trump’s policy to Obama’s Juvenile Referral Process, a pilot program in south Texas that sought to cut down on smuggling by detaining and questioning unaccompanied minors — known as ""circuit children"" — suspected of helping Mexican drug cartels transport people and narcotics across the border. The story said Obama’s program resulted in border agents ""tossing some of those kids into internment camps as an experiment."" ""Under Obama, young illegal immigrants were put in ‘facilities’ so they could be squeezed for any information they may or may not have about drug cartels,"" the story said. ""A program to detain kids is okay under a Democratic Party president, but preventing kids from going to jail with their parents is considered un-American when the president is a Republican."" We decided to check this claim out and see how Trump’s policy compared with the Obama program; we found significant differences between the policies and their outcomes. The Lid did not respond to a request for comment sent via Facebook Messenger. Attorney General Jeff Sessions issued an April memorandum announcing a ""zero-tolerance"" policy, according to which all immigrants apprehended for illegally crossing the U.S. border were referred for federal prosecution. Many immigrants subject to the zero-tolerance policy were adults traveling with children. Due to a 2015 district court decision, children cannot be held in federal jails with adults facing prosecution. Previous administrations shied away from prosecuting adults with children and, after the 2015 decision, tended to release families rather than separate them. But the Trump administration, citing its zero-tolerance policy, was separating families and placing children in shelters run by the Department of Health and Human Services until they could be released to a sponsor. More than 2,300 children were separated from adults between May 5 and June 9, according to the Department of Homeland Security. There was no law requiring the separation of families, and Trump was not ""preventing kids from going to jail"" by ordering it, as the Lid story suggested. Obama’s Juvenile Referral Process operated from May 2014 to September 2015 as a pilot program meant to combat smuggling. The program was the brainchild of former Border Patrol agent Robert Harris, whose intelligence analysts estimated that 78 percent of guides smuggling migrants and drugs into the U.S. were Mexicans younger than 18.  Mexican drug cartels often hire or conscript teenagers to smuggle people and drugs across the border because teenagers are not prosecuted if caught. Under laws governing treatment of ""unaccompanied alien children,"" minors from Mexico and Canada can be immediately sent back to their country. Sometimes they are deported by bus the same day they are apprehended. Minors from other nations, by contrast, must be transferred within 72 hours to the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement and placed in the least restrictive setting possible until they can be flown home.   Mexican teenagers smuggling on behalf of drug cartels are known as ""circuit children,"" and Harris told the Washington Post that several were caught and released multiple times before the Juvenile Referral Process, which was designed to deter repeat crossings.  In short, Mexican children suspected of smuggling drugs were held by the U.S. government rather than immediately being sent home. ""It was used for unaccompanied Mexican minors who had multiple apprehensions – up to 30 a year in a few cases – and thus were thought to be working on behalf of human and drug smuggling organizations,"" said Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute. The pilot progam also was established to create ""some type of consequence for children involved in smuggling, as they are usually just returned to Mexico and often cross again,"" said Maureen Meyer, director for Mexico and migrant rights at the Washington Office on Latin America. Under the program, Border Patrol worked with the federal prosecutors to determine whether to criminally prosecute a repeat border-crosser suspected of smuggling. Those not selected for prosecution were referred to the Office of Refugee Resettlement like minors from non-contiguous countries instead of being deported. While detained — sometimes for months — and awaiting the chance to appear before an immigration court, minors under the Juvenile Referral Process faced questioning from U.S. authorities about their affiliations. Most minors who completed the program were eventually deported after seeing an immigration judge, according to a 2015 report from the Washington Office on Latin America. Denise Gilman, a law professor who directs the immigration clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, said conditions under the Juvenile Referral Process were not great. ""It was a small pilot program for sure, although the detention facilities were certainly problematic and the length of detention uncertain,"" she said. Gilman noted that other facilities in Karnes City and Dilley, Texas, which the Obama administration used as licensed childcare facilities to detain families seeking asylum, did ""resemble internment camps."" She said this practice was ""carefully circumscribed"" by the end of the Obama administration as a result of legal challenges. But those facilities were separate from the process created under the Juvenile Referral Process, which handled only unaccompanied ""circuit children"" and placed them in the same Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities used for unaccompanied minors from non-contiguous countries. According to the Office of Refugee Resettlement website, these facilities are state-licensed and provide a range of care — including foster care, group homes, shelter, staff secure, secure and residential treatment centers — and they offer classroom education, health care, socialization and recreation opportunities, mental health services, legal services and case management. Meyer said these children were usually placed in the ""‘secure’ juvenile detention centers that are more restrictive"" because of their criminal activities. ""I never heard of any Mexican child in a ‘detention camp,’"" she said. Still, human rights advocates objected to the Juvenile Referral Program as an intelligence-gathering enterprise that could jeopardize minors’ post-deportation security. Violent drug cartels often retaliate against members suspected of talking with law enforcement by taking action against them or their families. An online blog claimed, ""Obama administration kept illegal Mexican kids in detention camps as 'experiment.'"" The statement sounds far more sinister than the facts in evidence. The ""experiment,"" the Juvenile Referral Process, detained older unaccompanied minors suspected of smuggling drugs or other immigrants across the border. These minors otherwise would have been immediately deported. They were housed in Office of Refugee Resettlement facilities in order to extract intelligence and cut down on smuggling. The pilot program lasted for slightly more than one year. Finally, the minors were not experimented on; rather, the program itself was a test.  The statement has an element of truth, but leaves out critical context that would give a different impression. We rate this statement Mostly False.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC9FCD80>],/factchecks/2018/jun/25/blog-posting/did-obama-detain-illegal-mexican-children-experime/

Trump campaign manager’s tweet omits that children detained under Obama were unaccompanied minors
","As President Donald Trump faced criticism from the left and right for his administration’s policy leading to separation of undocumented immigrant children from parents, conservatives fired back by arguing that President Barack Obama also detained children. ""Fact: Over 90,000 kids were detained under Obama. And no one cared,"" tweeted Trump’s campaign manager Brad Parscale June 20. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced in April the Trump administration would refer all people caught crossing the border illegally for prosecution, including adults traveling with children. As a result of that zero-tolerance policy, officials said about 2,300 children had been separated from their parents at the border between May 5 and June 9. In response to the political backlash, Trump signed an executive order June 20 stating the administration will temporarily keep families together pending proceedings. We found multiple claims on social media and on conservative websites stating that 90,000 children were detained under Obama, so we decided to fact-check the figure. Parscale also tweeted a Daily Caller article that included photos taken during a media tour of detention facilities in Texas and Arizona in 2014. These images show immigrants in caged-in facilities and sleeping on floors.  (In May, Trump correctly tweeted that Democrats had mistakenly tweeted 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the border in steel cages.) Parscale declined to comment on the record. Parscale appears to be referring to unaccompanied minors fleeing gang violence and poverty in Central America during Obama’s tenure. Those unaccompanied minors who crossed the border without parents are a different group from the children separated from their parents at the border in recent months. A report to the U.S. Senate in 2016 stated that since the beginning of fiscal year 2014, the Department of Health and Human Services had placed almost 90,000 unaccompanied minors with sponsors in the United States. Under the terms of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Act, unaccompanied minors from countries other than Canada and Mexico were transferred from Border Patrol to the Office of Refugee Resettlement, by law within 72 hours, said David Fitzgerald, co-director of the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at University of California San Diego. These minors were detained in a jail-like setting until they could be placed with a parent, family member, or other sponsor living in the U.S. They stayed with those caregivers until the end of their immigration proceedings, which would decide whether they could stay permanently or be deported. Under Obama, most of these detentions were short-term before the unaccompanied minors were released to a caregiver. There isn’t a clean answer for average detention time, but in federal filings in the Flores settlement case, the government said that for residents booked into family residential facilities during a stretch between October 2015 and May 2016 the average length of stay was 11.8 days. (The Flores settlement was a January 1997 court agreement between advocates for unaccompanied minors detained by immigration authorities and the Justice Department. The agreement determined immigrant children must be held in the ""least restrictive setting."") During Obama’s tenure, it was possible for undocumented children to be separated from a parent once they were already in the country if their parents ultimately got deported. While some children were separated from their parents under Obama, this was relatively rare, and occurred at a far lower rate than under Trump. Parscale said that ""no one cared"" about child detentions under Obama. But family detention under Obama was highly controversial. The majority of the Senate Democratic caucus -- 33 senators -- along with 178 House Democrats sent a letter in June 2015 to the Homeland Security Secretary urging an end to family detention. ""The prolonged detention of asylum-seeking mothers and children who pose no flight risk or danger to the community is unacceptable and goes against our most fundamental values,"" they wrote. The UN Refugee Agency filed an amicus brief in litigation against the detention of minors. Several rights organizations including the ACLU filed briefs in the July 2016 case in which the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the Flores settlement applies to all children, whether accompanied or unaccompanied by their parents. Parscale tweeted, ""Fact: Over 90,000 kids were detained under Obama. And no one cared."" The 90,000 children refers to the unaccompanied minors from Central America during Obama’s tenure. Children were detained by the federal government until they could be released to a parent or other caregiver in the U.S. However, Parscale omits that this group of children detained is a different situation from the recent Trump administration policy. The 90,000 refers to minors who crossed the border without any parents during Obama’s tenure. Those unaccompanied minors were detained until they were placed with a caregiver. The Trump administration policy separated children from their parents when they crossed the border.

"['State Budget', 'Illinois', 'JB Pritzker']","
Did Rauner really pour $1 billion ‘down the drain’?
","Big, round numbers play well in politics and this election year, ""$1 billion"" is having its moment in the race for Illinois governor. First there was Republican Gov. Bruce Rauner proclaiming in a commercial that the budget he proposed earlier this year contained a $1 billion tax break for Illinoisans. We rated the same claim Mostly False after he unveiled his budget plan in February. Now, Rauner’s fall challenger, Democrat J.B. Pritzker, is out with an ad skewering the incumbent for squandering the same amount in taxpayer dollars. ""$1 billion—that’s how much Bruce Rauner has wasted with his budget crisis,"" the ad asserts. ""Bruce Rauner poured that money down the drain."" There’s no doubt Rauner, as the state’s chief executive, played a starring role in the prolonged budget showdown with the legislature that left the state without a spending plan for two years. But he had plenty of co-stars, among them House Speaker Michael Madigan and Senate President John Cullerton, both Chicago Democrats. Pritzker’s attack is as short on detail as it is sharp on condemnation. Where does that $1 billion figure come from and why should Rauner own it? The ad doesn’t say, so we decided to take a look. The answer to the first question is simple. A spokesman for the Pritzker campaign said the number comes from Democratic State Comptroller Susana Mendoza, the keeper of the state’s books and a frequent Rauner critic. Mendoza calculated that the state racked up $1.03 billion in late payment penalties in 2017, largely because the budget standoff led to major delays in paying state vendors for their services. The budget impasse dragged on because the governor and Democrats who run the legislature had very different policy, tax and spending priorities. As a lawyer might put it, there was plenty of contributory negligence—not to mention gamesmanship and plain old stubborness—to go around. In short, the budget became hostage to an ideological debate centered on so-called Turnaround Agenda demands from Rauner that Democrats argued were largely unrelated to a state spending plan. In dispute were issues that included the imposition of term limits for legislators, a freeze on local property taxes, and workers’ compensation cuts. Also fueling the budget crisis and the bill backlog that grew with it was a significant drop in revenue after a temporary state income tax increase expired, reducing the rate from 5 percent to 3.75 percent just days before Rauner was sworn into office in 2015. Rauner had pressed the legislature to let it lapse, and Madigan and Cullerton obliged over the objections of then Democratic Gov. Pat Quinn, who lost to the Republican in November 2014. State law mandated the rate reduction at the end of that year, but Quinn urged lawmakers to step in and prevent it. ""I warned there would be dire catastrophe in my budget address and I laid out what the catastrophe could look like in an attempt to try and get the legislature to extend it, but no Republicans came forward and many Democrats were leery before November's election,"" Quinn told us in a phone interview. ""They simply did not want to vote on revenue before November—Democrats and Republicans."" It’s also worth noting that, even before the 2014 tax cut, the state had been accruing large penalties for tardy bill payments. A report from the Civic Federation, a Chicago-based budget watchdog, shows late payment interest penalties totaled more than $600 million in the three years prior to the budget standoff. David Merriman, an economist who heads the Fiscal Futures Project at the University of Illinois, sees the penalties as evidence of the state’s legacy of poor fiscal management, with government leaders of both parties approving budgets for nearly two decades that balanced out only on paper. ""The fiscal situation has been unsustainable, [Rauner] inherited it, it got worse under Rauner because they didn't have a budget for two years and because he didn't control spending,"" Merriman said. ""That’s his fault, but it’s also the legislature's fault."" Eventually, after two years of operating on autopilot and jeopardizing a number of critical services in the process, lawmakers last summer did put a budget in place that included an income tax rate hike, which provided a big jump in revenue. Rauner had vetoed that plan, but a handful of Republicans joined Democrats to override his rejection. A recent Pritzker campaign ad says Rauner ""wasted"" $1 billion ""with his budget crisis."" Pritzker’s ad seeks to blame Rauner for the entirety of a huge tab the state ran up last year on interest penalties for late payment of bills. The problem was significantly aggravated by a two-year budget standoff in Springfield that left many state services running on autopilot but with insufficient revenues to cover the costs. Rauner clearly played a key role in that logjam and it may be smart politics on Pritzker’s part to try to blame the mess entirely on the incumbent. But Rauner hardly acted alone. What’s more, running up an expensive late payment tab isn’t unique to the Rauner era. Chronic fiscal mismanagement over many administrations has made it harder for the state to pay bills in a timely fashion—even when the income tax rate was higher and more revenue was flowing in. Pritzker’s ad has its number straight, but uses it to blame Rauner alone for an unfortunate legacy that is shared by many. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA52D40>],/factchecks/2018/jun/25/jb-pritzker/did-rauner-really-pour-1-billion-down-drain/

Trump's executive order doesn't address 2,000 separated children and families would still be jailed?
","On June 21, 2018, the day after President Donald Trump signed an executive order on the separation of children from their parents at the border, U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin tried to poke holes in it. The Wisconsin Democrat is running for re-election in November 2018. Leah Vukmir and Kevin Nicholson are seeking the Republican nomination to run against her. Baldwin, interviewed on ""Late Night with Seth Meyers,"" claimed Trump’s order ""doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families."" In some respects, this is a fluid situation. So let’s set out what was known when Baldwin made her statement. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc The order Families attempting to enter the United States without permission had been separated in the past, but immigration officials did so as an exception and not a rule. That changed in April 2018, when U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced a zero-tolerance policy for all undocumented border crossings. Government agents charged undocumented people with a crime and sent them directly to detention centers. Any children were sent to be cared for in separate facilities. According to the latest reports, the government was holding over 2,300 minors under the age of 12. After an international outcry, Trump reversed himself and signed the executive order to end the practice of separating families. (Vukmir also shifted her position on separating families at the border, earning a Half Flip on our Flip-O-Meter.) The Trump order reiterates that the administration’s policy is to ""rigorously enforce our immigration laws."" It says in part: It is also the policy of this Administration to maintain family unity, including by detaining alien families together where appropriate and consistent with law and available resources … The Secretary of Defense shall take all legally available measures to provide to the Secretary, upon request, any existing facilities available for the housing and care of alien families, and shall construct such facilities if necessary and consistent with law ….Heads of executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent consistent with law, make available to the Secretary, for the housing and care of alien families pending court proceedings for improper entry, any facilities that are appropriate for such purposes. The Attorney General shall promptly file a request with the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California to modify the Settlement Agreement in Flores v. Sessions, CV 85-4544 (""Flores settlement""), in a manner that would permit the Secretary, under present resource constraints, to detain alien families together throughout the pendency of criminal proceedings for improper entry or any removal or other immigration proceedings. All our fact checks in the U.S. Senate race. So, to the second part of Baldwin’s statement, the order does call for continuing to detain families -- though together, rather than separating parents from their children. But her use of the word ""jailing"" goes too far. The families, while kept in custody in some type of facility, would not be incarcerated in jails. The children already separated As for the 2,300 children already separated, PolitiFact National said it was not clear how or if the policy change might ultimately affect them. Initially, on the day of order, a U.S. Department of Health and Human Services spokesperson said there would be no special effort from the Trump administration to reunite migrant families separated at the border. But later the same day, the department said the spokesperson had misspoken about the order. In a statement, the department said ""it is still very early and we are awaiting further guidance on the matter,"" but that ""reunification is always the ultimate goal of those entrusted with the care of"" unaccompanied alien children ""and the administration is working towards that for those UACs currently in HHS custody."" In any case, the order itself does not address the 2,300 children. Moreover, Reyna Torres Mendivil, Mexico's consul general in San Antonio, told National Public Radio that reunification would be hampered by the U.S. separation process, which keeps parents in federal custody while moving children into facilities controlled by the Department of Health and Human Services. ""The U.S. authorities create different files for the children than for the parents, and it's very difficult to follow up on those cases,"" Torres said. And CNN noted that separated children are in facilities or foster homes spread across states far from the U.S.-Mexico border, including Michigan, New York, South Carolina and more. The White House referred us to a spokeswoman for Health and Human Services, but we didn’t get a reply. Our rating Baldwin says Trump's executive order ""doesn't address the over 2,000 children who are already separated from their parents, and it doesn't change the fact that we would be jailing children with their families."" The thrust of Baldwin’s statement is correct. Federal officials in charge of reunification said after the order they ""are awaiting further guidance"" on how to proceed. But in fact the order does not address reunifying the 2,300 children with their parents, which is seen as a complicated process. The order also says, as Baldwin claims, that families entering the country without permission will continue to be detained  — together, rather than parents and children being separated. But while the families would be in custody, at various facilities, Baldwin overreaches in saying the families would be put in jails. Baldwin’s statement is accurate, but needs clarification  — our definition of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD21F00>],/factchecks/2018/jun/22/tammy-baldwin/trumps-executive-order-doesnt-address-2000-separat/

Johnson says last major drilling spill was in 1969
","It was 1969. Neil Armstrong took humankind's first steps on the moon. A little town in upstate New York called Woodstock became the world capital of free love and rock 'n' roll. And according to one gubernatorial candidate, it was the year of the U.S.' last major oil spill caused by an offshore drilling accident. Republican Eric Johnson's June 7 blog posting ""Despite the spill, we still need to drill"" defends drilling in the face of the massive spill in the Gulf of Mexico. He argues that the method is safe, compared with the alternatives. One reason: It hasn't caused a major oil spill in a long, long time. ""Predictably, liberal activists call the Gulf disaster a warning of things to come if we expand drilling, but this incident is an unfortunate exception to the rule. The last major oil spill from a drilling accident in America happened over 40 years ago in 1969. In fact, oil spills from tankers are far more common than the very rare leaks from rigs or pipelines.""This item will deal with the claim about the date of the last major oil spill from a drilling accident. A later one will cover whether tanker spills are more common than ones from rigs or pipelines. As proof, Johnson's campaign sent us a column written by Deroy Murdock, a Scripps Howard News Service columnist and writer for the conservative National Review Online. Murdock's ""Offshore oil drilling: cleaner than Mother Nature,"" states the following: ""Capitol Hill Democrats claim offshore drilling poses unacceptable ecological risks. This is yet another overblown worry. Democrats and other environmental naysayers cite the 80,000 barrels that spilled six miles off of Santa Barbara, Calif., inundating beaches and aquatic life. This hydrocarbon Hindenburg haunts the memories of those who witnessed it. But this genuine catastrophe occurred in January 1969 -- nearly 40 years ago.""The campaign also sent us other opinion pieces that repeat the assertion, plus a 2008 article by McClatchy Newspapers in which a Minerals Management Services calls the Santa Barbara drilling spill the last ""significant"" one. To fact-check this claim, we looked at a 2009 report produced by the American Petroleum Institute, an industry group, that gives a 71-page analysis of oil spills from a variety of sources such as tankers, refineries and oil well blowouts. It states that before 2009, there were 17 blowouts at marine wells in the U.S. since 1964, spilling roughly 249,000 barrels of oil. (This number excludes spills caused by tanker crashes such as the 1989 Exxon Valdez.) The largest in volume was the Santa Barbara spill of 1969 referenced by Murdock and Johnson, in which an estimated 100,000 barrels of oil spilled into the Pacific Ocean, according to the API. The Santa Barbara spill was so big it ranked seventh among the 10 largest oil spills caused by marine well blowouts in the world, the report states. Two other U.S. spills, both in 1970, rank eighth and 10th. Fourteen marine blowouts have taken place in the U.S. between 1969 and 2007. Six of them took place after 1990 and spilled a total of nearly 13,700 barrels.It's clear that there have been numerous marine well blowouts since 1969, but were any one of them ""major""?We interviewed three scientists who said that the impact of a spill has little to do with its volume. Scientists have proven that spills far smaller than Santa Barbara's have been devastating. Marine oil spills can take place at any number of points on the fuel's way to your gas tank. The stuff is often shipped in tankers or stored near water. Judith McDowell, a scientist with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, a major research facility, cites the effects of a 1969 spill in Buzzard Bay, Mass., caused by a ship that ran aground. It dumped roughly 4,500 barrels into the bay and is still hurting species that play a crucial ecological roles. Some shellfish beds were considered tainted for more than a decade. Jeremy B.C. Jackson, a leading authority on the impact of oil spills and a professor with the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, was lead author of an influential study on the 1986 Bahia las Minas spill in Panama. It determined that the roughly 60,000 barrels of oil that flowed from a broken storage container destroyed about 60 miles of coastline habitat. Even if the oil never makes it to the coastline, it can kill any sea turtle or dolphin that encounters it, scientists said. Tainted fish can sicken humans and other species that eat them. Species' rates of reproduction can sink for years. Johnson's statement fails the Truth-O-Meter test. While the nation's largest oil well blowout did take place in 1969, it's not factually correct to call it the ""last major oil spill."" First of all, two of the largest blowouts in the world took place in the U.S. the following year. More importantly, experts agree that spills far smaller in volume to the 1969 disaster have been devastating. From a scientific perspective, Johnson's decision to single out the 1969 blowout as the last ""major"" one makes no sense. We rate Johnson's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCDAFC0>],/factchecks/2010/jun/17/eric-johnson/johnson-says-last-major-drilling-spill-was-1969/

Obama says he issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater oil drilling
","In his June 15, 2010, Oval Office address on the Gulf oil spill, President Barack Obama defended his decision to temporarily halt new oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico in the wake of the Deepwater Horizon tragedy. ""Already, I’ve issued a six-month moratorium on deepwater drilling,"" Obama said. ""I know this creates difficulty for the people who work on these rigs, but for the sake of their safety, and for the sake of the entire region, we need to know the facts before we allow deepwater drilling to continue."" On May 27, Obama did announce a 6-month moratorium on exploratory drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. But if you think that means there's no more oil production going on in the Gulf, you'd be mistaken. Wells that are currently producing oil will continue to produce. There are 72 active platforms in water depths of 500 feet or greater (the definition of deepwater) in the Gulf of Mexico that will be allowed to continue to operate. At issue here is the term ""oil drilling."" Many people use the term broadly to refer to the entire process of extracting oil from the ground, not just drilling the holes looking for oil. But once a well starts producing oil, it's not being ""drilled"" anymore. According to the moratorium notice, the U.S. Minerals Management Service will not consider drilling permits for deepwater wells for six months. In addition, operators that are currently drilling any well ""must proceed at the next safe opportunity to secure the well and take all necessary steps to cease operations and temporarily abandon or close the well until they receive further guidance from the Regional Supervisor for Field Operations."" There are 33 drilling operations in water deeper than 500 feet that fit that bill, which means that they needed to get to a safe place and then stop drilling. For the record, Deepwater Horizon was among the wells in the exploratory drilling phase. When the Department of the Interior issued the moratorium directive on May 30, Secretary Ken Salazar published a statement saying, ""Deepwater production from the Gulf of Mexico will continue subject to close oversight and safety requirements, but deepwater drilling operations must safely come to a halt. With the BP oil spill still growing in the Gulf, and investigations and reviews still underway, a six-month pause in drilling is needed, appropriate, and prudent."" We think a lot of people probably assumed Obama's statement meant that all oil operations in the Gulf of Mexico were put on a six-month hiatus. That's not the case. The moratorium relates to exploratory oil drilling, not to existing, oil-producing deepwater platforms, which will continue to produce. So Obama's words were technically accurate, though due to the common use of the phrase oil drilling to refer to all oil operations, we think it may have confused some people. And so we rule his statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB301C0>],/factchecks/2010/jun/16/barack-obama/obama-says-he-issued-six-month-moratorium-deepwate/

White House refused international oil spill aid, Florida senator says
","Florida Sen. George LeMieux continues to be a leading critic of President Barack Obama's handling of the Gulf of Mexico oil spill.LeMieux, who was appointed to the Senate last year by Gov. Charlie Crist, has described Obama's response as ""dereliction of duty,"" and said Obama appears more interested in photo-ops than solving the crisis growing in the Gulf. LeMieux also has pressed the federal government to add more skimmer boats off Florida's coast to collect encroaching oil. Now, LeMieux claims that offers of assistance from foreign governments are going ignored by President Obama and his administration.LeMieux let out his frustration in a posting on Twitter.""State Department reports today 17 countries have offered 21 times to send aid, including skimmers,"" LeMieux wrote on June 15, 2010. ""Why has the White House refused help?""He repeated the same claim in a CNN interview on June 16.With such a scramble to contain the oil and prevent it from damaging Florida's beaches, we wondered if the federal government has been refusing offers of foreign aid.Since LeMieux says his information comes from the State Department, that's where we went to look.In a press briefing on May 19, reporters asked State Department spokesman Gordon Duguid of the possibility of international aid (The Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20). Duguid said that, at that time, 17 countries had offered some form of assistance.A reporter then asked why none of the offers had been accepted.""I don’t know that none of them have been accepted,"" Duguid said. ""I know that BP has accepted some directly without going to the U.S. The offers were mostly for booms and dispersants. There are some offers of support which come in the form of 'If you let us know what you need, we'll be happy to see if we can provide that.' There are others that were for equipment that the U.S. or BP had in supply at the time and was not running short. So there were different types of offers, and I have an understanding that BP may have accepted one or two. I don’t have the details of that.""So it was up to BP earlier? It’s not your decision?, a reporter asked.""The decision on what to accept is being done for the U.S. Government by the Coast Guard,"" Duguid said. ""They are the authoritative agency to make those decisions. BP, being a private company, can accept the help that is offered to it directly. We don’t control that. However, the expertise that is there in the Gulf is working very hard to try and contain this spill and to cap that – cap the well.""Another exchange between the State Department and reporters came a week later. State Department spokesman T.J. Crowley said 17 countries were still offering aid, as were four other entities -- the European Maritime Safety Agency, the European Commission’s Monitoring and Information Centre, the International Maritime Organization, and the Environment Unit of the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs and the United Nations Environment Program.""My understanding is that two offers of assistance have been accepted thus far – I believe it's Mexico and Norway,"" Crowley said. ""Those offers were actually accepted by BP as part of this Unified Area Command. But we also are working internationally. I think there's assistance flowing in through private as well as public sources, so this is something that we continue to evaluate. But I would defer probably to the Coast Guard in terms of explaining the process.""A reporter then noted an apparent disconnect, with some governors calling for more booms while the federal government appears to be refusing some internationals offers for help.""Let me be clear, we are grateful for the assistance that we have been offered internationally,"" Crowley said. ""It is something that we evaluate every day. But again, I would defer to others, particularly the Coast Guard, to go through where they are in the process of evaluating particular offers.""Another series of questions followed June 9, and then again on June 14 and 15.On June 14, the State Department reported that booms from Canada had arrived in Alabama. Crowley then was asked to explain why it took weeks for some foreign offers of assistance to be accepted, and why others still hadn't.""First of all, the offers came in. Some of those offers were specific; some of those offers were general,"" Crowley said. ""Secondly, the United States Government was looking to see what are immediately available sources of relevant equipment and technology there in the Gulf region.""The State Department on June 14 released a list of the countries that offered to help -- Canada, Mexico, the Republic of Korea, Croatia, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Romania, Russia, Spain, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom and Vietnam. That's 17 countries. The State Department also detailed what offers had been accepted.From Mexico -- Two skimmers and 13,780 feet of boom (accepted in early May).From Norway -- Eight skimming systems (accepted in early May).From Netherlands -- Three sets of Koseq Rigid Sweeping Arms, which attach to the sides of ships and gather oil (accepted on May 23).From Canada -- 9,843 feet of boom (accepted on June 4).On June 15, Qatar, the 18th country, offered chains of containment boom and Sweden followed up on an earlier offer to provide skimmers. State Department officials also started making a distinction about the aid -- it wasn't coming for free.""There have been some questions about these offers of assistance. For the most part, they are offers to sell supplies,"" Crowley said. ""And in determining whether to accept these offers, we look at the availability of domestic sources and also compare pricing on the open market. So that may be one of the reasons why, in some cases, we’ve been able to accept these offers and pursued them. In other cases, we’re holding them in abeyance as we continue to identify sources of important equipment that will be needed for this -- to handle this over the long term.""The Washington Post reported about the decision to accept or decline foreign aid in its June 15 edition, noting that the decision to accept foreign aid came after weeks of delay, and that foreign governments were unsure if they should contact the government or BP.In some cases, the Post reported, the administration rejected offers because they failed to meet U.S. specifications: For example, the private consortium that serves as Norway's spill-response team uses a chemical dispersant that the Environmental Protection Agency has not approved.Japan was offering protective booms and the Swedish Coast Guard was prepared to send three ships that can each collect 370 barrels of oil an hour. The Norwegian Coastal Authority, the Post reported, has approved sending nearly a third of the nation's spill response equipment to the gulf if asked. Let's tie this all together. The State Department has received official assistance offers from 18 countries and another four groups. Some of those offers are vague, others are specific. Most all of them are offers to sell equipment or use the equipment.The State Department has accepted the offers of four countries -- Mexico, Norway, Netherlands and Canada -- and says it is reviewing and considering other offers. That's in contrast to LeMieux's statement, which is that the White House has ""refused"" international aid.But it's also clear the United States has either struggled to act on offers of foreign aid, or that processing the requests has been delayed. Japan, Sweden and Norway are all prepared to send resources or manpower to the Gulf should the U.S. sign off. Other countries also are willing to help, but have been kept on the sidelines. Taking that into account, we'll rate LeMieux's statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD37F00>],/factchecks/2010/jun/16/george-lemieux/white-house-refused-international-oil-spill-aid-fl/

Markey says oil companies pay nothing for Gulf drilling, costing taxpayers $50 billion
","The ongoing oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has focused attention on a wide range of problems with the nation's regulation of how oil and other natural resources are extracted. One of those issues has to do with how much oil companies are paying the federal government for the right to drill offshore.At a hearing of the House Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Energy and Environment on June 15, 2010, Rep. Ed Markey, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman, took aim at the oil companies whose executives were assembled as witnesses at the hearing.One of the claims Markey made was that ""right now, every single one of the companies here today and dozens of others are drilling for free in the Gulf of Mexico on leases that will cost American taxpayers more than $50 billion in lost royalties.""We decided to see if Markey was right.At first, we thought Markey was saying that no oil company pays anything for the right to drill in the Gulf. But we knew that was not true. In a previous item we noted that the Minerals Management Service -- the office in the Interior Department charged with regulating natural-resources extraction on federal lands as well as collecting the resulting royalties -- took in just under $10 billion in royalties and other revenues in 2009, placing it in the top 10 government offices for generating federal revenue.According to MMS, Gulf of Mexico revenues for oil alone for 2009 amounted to more than $61 million for Louisiana, $1.4 million for Mississippi and more than $285,000 for Alabama.But when we took a closer look at Markey's words, we realized that he was referring to a dispute over oil lease contracts from the Clinton era. These involve two related issues. One concerns drilling leases signed in 1998 and 1999. The other concerns drilling leases signed in 1996, 1997 and 2000. It gets complicated, so bear with us.In order to promote the extraction of certain kinds of natural resources, the Interior Secretary may exercise powers under the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act and the Deep Water Royalty Relief Act of 1995 to grant royalty relief to drillers. In the mid 1990s, when the latter law was passed, fossil fuel prices were low, so certain types of drilling projects seemed uneconomical without government assistance. The subsidies took the form of relieving companies from having to pay federal royalties on the resources they extracted.For 1996, 1997 and 2000, the lease contracts were written in such a way that the royalty relief disappeared once the market price of oil rose above a certain level. When the price reached that level, the companies would have to start paying a royalty. But the contracts for leases agreed to in 1998 and 1999 did not include any provisions for price triggers. So regardless of how high the market price rose, no company holding a lease that was signed in one of those two years would ever owe the government a dime in royalties.During the George W. Bush administration, MMS belatedly tried to persuade leaseholders to agree to pay royalties once a price trigger was reached, and the department had some success renegotiating the contracts. But many oil companies rejected MMS' proposals to insert a price trigger.In 2008, the Government Accountability Office -- the nonpartisan, investigative arm of Congress -- estimated that upwards of $1 billion in revenues had already been foregone from the 1998 and 1999 leases. It also cited a variety of scenarios that would suggest that the loss over 25 years from the 1998 and 1999 leases could total between $4.3 billion and $14.7 billion.But remember those accurately worded contracts from the 1996, 1997 and 1998 leases? Well, it turns out they're not locked down either.In 2006, Kerr-McGee, an energy company later purchased by Anadarko Petroleum Corp., sued the government, arguing that none of the price triggers from 1996, 1997 and 2000 were valid. In 2007, the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana sided with Kerr-McGee, and in 2009, a three-judge panel from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit agreed. In September 2009, the federal government, in a brief written by Solicitor General Elena Kagan (now a Supreme Court nominee), asked the Supreme Court to take up the case. But it declined, effectively letting the lower court's decision in favor of Kerr-McGee stand.We should mention that it's possible that Congress could legislate a remedy that forces the oil companies to pay royalties despite what the contracts say and what the courts have ruled. In fact, efforts to do just that are under way, and they may get a boost from popular anger over the oil spill. But the chances of such a law being enacted are only speculative at this point, so, in addition to the lost royalties from 1998 and 1999, it seems reasonable for Markey to add in the lost royalties from all five years, as he seems to have done.And how big are those three additional years worth of royalties? When the GAO surveyed the data in 2008, the agency suggested that the government would have to refund more than $1 billion in royalties already collected, in addition to forgoing billions of dollars more that had been expected to materialize over the next 25 years. Reports by the GAO and the Congressional Research Service, Congress' nonpartisan research arm, offered wildly varying estimates, from a low of almost $16 billion to a high $60 billion.The fact is, forecasting the market price of energy -- not to mention the future production from drill sites -- as far as 25 years into the future means that even the best experts can make little more than educated guesses. Oil prices in particular are notoriously volatile even in the short term, much less on the scale of a quarter century.In the report, GAO itself urged the utmost of caution in assessing these various scenarios. The ranges for lost revenue ""should not be viewed as probabilistic estimates of what actual forgone royalties will be, or even firm boundaries within which forgone royalties will fall. Rather, the scenarios reflect reasonable possibilities based on recent experience and possible future prices.""So where does this leave Markey's comment? It's on the right track, but we do have some quibbles with it.First, he would have been better served if he'd chosen his words more carefully. We think a reasonable person hearing his statement -- but unaware of the controversy over the lease language -- would come away thinking that no oil company pays a dime for anything it pumps out of the Gulf. In reality, the companies pay tens of millions of dollars a year just to extract oil in the Gulf alone.Second, we believe Markey cites the $50 billion figure a little too blithely. He picked a number on the high end of an estimate range that will be subject to lots of cross-cutting influences over the next quarter-century -- first and foremost the volatile price of oil. If he'd said ""leases that could cost American taxpayers more than $50 billion in lost royalties"" -- rather than ""will cost"" -- he would have been on much safer ground.In an interview, Markey's office noted that the comment we fact-checked was an opening statement that summarized topics the hearing would address, and that lawmakers and witnesses proceeded to cover the topic of lost royalties in greater detail later in the hearing. They added that in Markey's view, the higher range of the estimate seems more likely based on their reading of oil price trends.But they acknowledged that the estimates are just that -- estimates and overall, we think many listeners would come away with the impression that the federal government was not getting any royalties when, in fact, the companies pay tens of millions of dollars a year just for drilling in the Gulf. In our view, Markey's comment, while broadly accurate, would have benefited from better specificity. So we find the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC63CAC0>],/factchecks/2010/jun/16/edward-markey/markey-says-oil-companies-pay-nothing-gulf-drillin/

Exxon oil spill clean-up plan has long, detailed media-relations section
","At a Congressional hearing looking at how oil companies respond to oil spills, here was an unlikely claim: Exxon Mobil's emergency plan for dealing with an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico has 40 pages on how to deal with the media, but only nine pages on how to clean up a spill.The statement sounded improbable to us. Isn't answering media questions easier than cleaning up a major oil spill? So we decided to check it out. The hearings, held June 16, 2010, were aimed at letting members of Congress grill the oil executives on their plans, and they were held by the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee chaired by Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. Another Congressman, Bart Stupak, was particularly concerned about how similar the clean-up plans of all the major oil companies seemed to be. ""It could be said that BP is the one bad apple in the bunch,"" Stupak said. ""But, unfortunately, they appear to have plenty of company. Exxon and other oil companies are just as unprepared to respond to a major oil spill in the Gulf as BP.""He singled out Exxon Mobil, though, for particular criticism. Unlike the rest of the companies, Stupak said, Exxon Mobil devoted 40 pages to how to handle the media, everything from suggested statements to pre-written press releases to instructions on directing questions about global warning and the Exxon Valdez spill to corporate headquarters. ""While Exxon Mobil has 40 pages on its media response strategy, its plan for resource protection is only five pages long and its plan for oil removal is just nine pages long,"" Stupak said.""If a public affairs officer is asked about criminal charges, the plan instructs them to say, 'We believe that there are no grounds for such charges. This was clearly an accident and we are working to respond to the immediate needs of the incident,' "" the Michigan Democrat added. ""That talking point is ready to go before a hypothetical incident even occurs, before Exxon Mobil could have any idea of whether it was actually an accident or if there are any grounds for criminal charges. In short, Exxon Mobil has meticulously anticipated virtually every conversation that the company might need to have with the media in the days following an oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico.""The committee released the reports of the companies as part of their investigation. So we reviewed Exxon Mobil's 663-page plan to see if Stupak's description was accurate or exaggerated for effect. First, we'll look at the section on how Exxon handles the media. It starts on page 557 with Appendix K and continues to page 596. That's 39 pages. And just as Stupak said, it contains detailed outlines for roles and responsibilities involving the media. Questions about global warming and the Exxon Valdez are categorized as including ""sensitive corporate issues"" that should be handled by Exxon headquarters.""Category D requires referral to EMCorp for response and should not be included in press releases or response statements issued from site/region or Functional HQ,"" the document said. The appendix also includes sample press releases and suggested statements for an index of topics. Yes, it does have the pre-written denial of grounds for criminal charges. So Stupak is right about the press section of the document. BP's media section, by the way, is only six pages long. Chevron's is five pages, ConocoPhillips' is five pages and Shell's is four pages.Next, we looked at Section 13 in the Exxon plan, which is ""Resource Protection Methods."" It runs from pages 330 to 334, which is five pages. It includes a list of things the company might do to protect wildlife, everything from the deployment of several types of booms, using chemical dispersants and ""in situ"" burning (burning oil to prevent spreading) to removing sea turtle nests and playing the recorded sounds of live birds. We also looked at Section 15, ""Oil and Debris Removal Procedures."" It runs from pages 350 to 358, or nine pages. It includes some of the same elements as the previous section, including the use of booms, chemical dispersants and burning.So Stupak is largely correct in his descriptions. We did notice that a few of the elements described in those sections, though, were explained in greater length in other sections of the report. There are an additional seven pages on wildlife rehabilitation, an additional 23 pages on using chemical dispersants, and another 14 pages on burning. So that's an additional 44 pages.We asked Exxon Mobil for a response on Stupak's charges, but we didn't hear back. During the hearing, Exxon CEO Rex Tillerson didn't directly address why the media section was so long. But he did defend the fact that all of the oil companies' plans are highly similar to BP's plan.""You know, the aspect of the plan, the cookie-cutter characterization, should not come as much of a surprise, because the industry has relied on sharing of resources -- boats, booms, skimmer equipment. And in working with the Coast Guard and federal agencies, what we really should have is a unified plan. Because it doesn't matter whose well has the problem, when it has the problem, we need to be able to respond with everything we have available. So those plans look the same because in fact they call upon the same resources to respond,"" Tillerson said.In rating Stupak's statement, we find he is largely accurate in his description that the Exxon Mobil plan ""has 40 pages on its media response strategy"" while its plan for resource protection ""is only five pages long and its plan for oil removal is just nine pages long."" We did notice that other sections of the plan expand on some of the topics listed in resource protection and oil removal. Nevertheless, Exxon's media plan is highly detailed and lengthy, particularly when compared with the other oil company plans and other sections of its own report. So we rate Stupak's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECCD1180>],/factchecks/2010/jun/16/bart-stupak/exxon-oil-spill-clean-plan-has-long-detailed-media/
"['Oil Spill', 'Florida', 'James Carville']","
Carville says Sink was 'first official' to say BP should pay for ads
","Since the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, several Florida politicians have been talking tough and trying to take credit for demanding a stronger response on the oil spill. And now Democratic political consultant and Louisiana resident James Carville says CFO Alex Sink, a Democratic candidate for Florida governor, should get props for being first to ask BP for tourism ad bucks.Here's what Carville wrote in a June 8 fundraising letter for Sink's campaign, which he supports:""Alex is the one who called on BP's CEO to come to Florida to explain how he expects to protect Florida's economy and environment. She was also the first official who said that BP should pay $25 million for an ad campaign to promote Florida tourism.""We wondered if Sink really was the ""first official"" to say BP should fund a campaign to promote Florida. How quickly politicians make such a request is relevant because the spill started April 20 and the tourism season in part of the state gets underway Memorial Day weekend.For starters, we need to set the parameters for ""official."" Appointed officials? Anyone in elected office? Any statewide official? That's unclear from Carville's letter, and Carville's office referred us to the Sink campaign. Spokesman Kyra Jennings told us in an e-mail that the reference was to the ""first elected official in the state (which I believe she was, at least high profile or statewide elected official)."" For Sink's part, Jennings sent us a link to a Bay News 9 TV story about a May 8 press conference Sink had in St. Petersburg after she met with a BP representative. That story stated, ""According to Sink, she has asked BP to fund a global media campaign to explain to tourists that the state is open for business, to consider fronting or advancing money on behalf of small businesses and coastal communities for interruption claims."" On May 10, Sink wrote a letter to BP asking that it ""fully fund the cost of a worldwide advertising campaign to put the brakes on the economic damage to our state's number-one industry."" Neither the TV news story posted on the website nor Sink's letter included a specific dollar request from BP. Gov. Charlie Crist announced on May 25 that $25 million had been wired to the state.Jennings also pointed to a St. Petersburg Times/Miami Herald story on May 26 about a press conference Crist held about the tourism ad money. The article stated: ""It was Sink on May 10 who first demanded that the oil giant BP pay for a TV ad blitz aimed at shoring up Florida tourism.''So Sink pushed BP for the tourism ad money on May 10, and even raised the idea on May 8. What about other statewide elected officials?Jennings sent us a link to an Associated Press article about Gov. Crist asking BP to provide about $35 million for tourism ads on May 12. Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey confirms for PolitiFact Florida that Crist first sought tourism ad dollars from BP on that date. As for the rest of the state cabinet, spokesmen for Attorney General Bill McCollum and Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson said neither sought tourism ad dollars from BP.The only other statewide elected officials in Florida are our two senators. Sen. Bill Nelson did not seek tourism ad dollars, according to his spokesperson. Sen. George LeMieux's spokesman said he didn't think LeMieux asked for tourism ad money, but never gave a definitive answer. We searched news articles and press releases and could find no such proposal from LeMieux. So Sink was the first statewide elected official to demand tourism ad money from BP. But Carville's letter said she was ""the first official"" and we think a reasonable person would not limit the statement to statewide officials.Next we contacted Visit Florida, the state's tourism office, which received money to pay for a campaign promoting Florida. CEO Chris Thompson told us that he spoke on the phone with state Rep. Marti Coley, R-Marianna, while she attended a May 4 town hall in Fort Walton Beach.""Rep. Coley was the one that seemed to be taking the lead,"" Thompson said. ""'She said, 'If BP was willing to make some funding available for tourism promotion could you put it to good use?' And I said, 'Yes ma'am.' ''Coley helped connect Visit Florida with BP and two days later, on May 6, Visit Florida had a proposal ready for $19.45 million. That proposal later grew to $34.75 million, Thompson said, because the Governor's Office wanted a more significant initial response. Thompson said that he did not discuss the tourism ad proposal directly with Crist but did discuss it with Chris Hart, the director of the Governor's Office of Tourism, Trade and Economic Development.""Even though I didn't have a conversation with Gov. Crist, his office was in on the conversations,"" Thompson said. ""The first politician that got me involved was Marti Coley.""We interviewed Coley about the May 4 town hall meeting.""One thing we kept hearing from everyone was they were being inudated with cancellations,"" she said, referring to hotels and charter boats. She said she asked a BP representative attending the town hall meeting if BP would help advertise through Visit Florida and other organizations that the beaches were open.""I called our state agency, which does our advertising, and said, 'Put a proposal together,' "" Coley said.We also talked to Hope Lanier, the BP spokesperson at that meeting. Lanier said Coley ""stood up in the meeting and volunteered to be a point person to work with BP and VISIT FLORIDA toward trying to pull together a workable solution for tourism funding."" PolitiFact Florida could not find news coverage of the town hall meeting in a Nexis search and when the state did get the $25 million, Coley didn't appear to take credit for it in a press release. But she did in a June 9 article in the Jackson County Floridan. (Coley is running for re-election in Florida House District 7.) The article stated: ""In response to the disaster, Coley mentioned to attendees that she has been working with Visit Florida -- Florida's main tourism advocate -- and BP officials to get the initial $25 million contribution from the oil company to go towards damage control. Coley says she worked hard to ensure BP officials stepped up to their financial responsibility of lessening the impact on tourism with an advertising campaign. She is now pushing for an additional contribution for further efforts, but all is up to Gov. Charlie Crist at this time.""Officials at Visit Florida also recalled state Sen. Don Gaetz, R-Niceville, speaking up about the need for tourism ads early. Gaetz's chief legislative aide, Chris Clark, said Gaetz spoke with a BP representative on May 2 to ask ""if they would be willing to help with advertising"" but did not ask for a specific dollar amount.Sink's campaign did not provide any documentation that she specifically asked for $25 million, either, but we think the more interesting point is whether she was the ""first official"" to say BP should give the state money for a tourism ad campaign.We find evidence that other state officials spoke up earlier than Sink, though she was the first statewide elected official to raise the issue. Carville's letter is unspecific on this point, so we have to consider what a reasonable person would think. And by the accounts of Visit Florida, we find others spoke up sooner.

"['Georgia', 'LGBTQ', 'Karen Handel']","
Did Handel ever join the Log Cabin Republicans?
","Karen Handel, who wants to become the state’s first female governor, is getting a high-profile education in Republican primary politics -- bare-knuckled Georgia style. One of Handel’s opponents, former U.S. Rep. Nathan Deal, has publicly attacked Handel for her cozy relationship with the gay community earlier in her political career when she was campaigning for the Fulton County Commission and later its chairmanship. Among other things, Deal has alleged Handel was a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a gay rights GOP organization that endorsed both her 2002 and 2003 election bids.Handel and her strategists have repeatedly denied she was ever a member of the group, including in a June 9 article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. In the article, Marc Yeager, who was president of the Georgia group in 2002 and 2003, said that Handel was a “dues-paying member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans from 2002 to 2004, something Handel also denies.” Deal continues to insist Handel was a member. So who’s telling the truth? To understand what’s going on here, you have to turn back the political clock seven or eight years. Back to very different campaigns. Handel was then seeking a job where Fulton County’s large and politically active gay community was a key constituency. The support of that community is vital to anyone seeking office locally. Both Republicans and Democrats aggressively court the gay vote. But in a statewide Republican primary, the dynamics change dramatically, tilting strongly conservative. In statewide races, the clout of gay voters fades. In a statewide Republican primary, the conservative vote moves to the forefront. And that vote can easily be a decisive factor in a multicandidate contest like the one in which Deal and Handel find themselves.Deal is trying to paint Handel as overly friendly with Atlanta’s gay community in an effort to cut into the most conservative part of her voter base.  Make no mistake, this is a fight to the finish. At most, only two candidates of the seven running will emerge from the July 20 GOP primary. Deal’s camp has gone for Handel’s jugular over her outreach to gay voters. And Deal’s strategists think they smell blood. Handel’s camp has responded by accusing Deal of having a “history of bigoted remarks.”A news release by the Handel camp late last week said this: “When he [Deal] found out that 8 years ago Karen Handel spoke to the Log Cabin Republicans ... it sent him into a month-long, delusional attack against her.” Deal has, among other things, accused Handel of supporting “gay adoption” during her Fulton County Commission bids. There is scant evidence of that, and PolitiFact Georgia has previously given the former congressman a “Barely True” on the Truth-O-Meter for that accusation. But the paper and electronic trail on Handel and the Log Cabin Republicans is much stronger. The Southern Voice, a newspaper that catered to the gay community and later went bankrupt, carried numerous articles about Handel’s 2002 and 2003 commission runs. And in those she is repeatedly identified as a member of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans. Handel never asked for a correction or clarification. Handel spokesman Dan McLagan agrees with that last point. “The Southern Voice is going to say all kinds of wacky stuff,” McLagan said. “The fact a retraction was not asked for is not proof of the assertion. She probably wasn’t sitting around reading a gay tabloid.” McLagan added: “She doesn’t remember ever having been a member.” But Yeager, the Log Cabin leader at the time, said he does remember. “Karen handed me the check [for her membership dues],” he said during an interview with PolitiFact Georgia.   And he happens to be a guy who keeps a record of his e-mails. One of those, from Yeager to Log Cabin board member Cathy Dudley in March 2003, contains an attachment -- a mailing list for the hundred or so Georgia Log Cabin members at that time. The list was being used to mail monthly invites to Log Cabin meetings. Handel’s name, telephone numbers, e-mail address and home address are on that list, which was examined by PolitiFact Georgia. It clearly lists her as a dues-paying member whose membership ran through July 2003. Another attachment in a later e-mail listed her as a member through July 2004. McLagan was unimpressed. He suggested that Jamie Ensley, the current president of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans, had membership records indicating Handel was not a member of the group. Unlike Yeager, however, Ensley declined to share membership records with PolitiFact Georgia.“Under no circumstances can I share our memberships rolls,” Ensley said. McLagan, meanwhile, questioned the motives of  Yeager, who is no longer with the Log Cabin Republicans. McLagan said Yeager’s partner is an Obama supporter. Yeager said that is true, but he stands by his statements and e-mails about Handel’s earlier membership in the Log Cabin Republicans.“My partner, Roger, ... applied for becoming an Obama delegate early in the process but never pursued it due to the time required for the whole nomination and delegate process,” Yeager said in an e-mail to the AJC. “I don’t think he ever went to any meetings. Certainly it has been no secret that he always has been and still is a Democrat. This was always a point of curiosity within the gay press with me being president of Georgia LCR [Log Cabin Republicans].”‘Nuf said, or so says McLagan. “These guys have an agenda,” McLagan said.  Handel, however, is running against fellow Republicans at this point in the race, not Democrats. And it is a fellow Republican who has accused her of belonging to the Log Cabin Republicans.What about Yeager’s e-mails that show Handel’s name appeared on the Log Cabin Republicans’ membership roll? They certainly appear genuine.“I can type up an e-mail that says anything,” McLagan said. Perhaps. But the evidence is overwhelming that Handel did indeed belong to the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans -- whether or not she remembers it. Newspapers reported it. A membership list backs it up. And the man running the organization at the time swears by it.Handel and her handlers, however, still choose to deny it. This might have rated a False on the Truth-O-Meter. But the complex dance Handel has engaged in over this issue moves it up a notch. Seems the metro Atlanta temperatures aren’t the only thing a bit overheated these days. We give her a Pants On Fire.

"['Environment', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Perry: State has cut ozone 22%, nitrogen oxide emissions 46%
","It's Gov. Rick Perry vs. Washington again, this time in a battle over Texas' compliance with the federal Clean Air Act. A day after the state filed suit to stop the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency from taking over parts of the state program that issues permits for companies to foul the air, Perry touted afresh Texas' progress in reducing pollution levels. Since 2000, Perry said in a press release issued Tuesday, ""the Texas clean air program (has) achieved a 22 percent reduction in ozone and a 46 percent decrease in NOx (nitrogen oxide) emissions."" The same statistic was cited by Perry in a May 28 letter to President Barack Obama and mentioned in news accounts such as a New York Times article published online June 9. Sounds good, but what do the figures mean? And does the state deserve credit for improvements? First, let's look at the basic science. A goal of the federal Clean Air Act is to reduce the levels of what EPA calls ""commonly found air pollutants."" Among those is ground-level ozone, which forms when nitrogen oxide emissions mix with volatile organic compounds in the presence of sunlight and heat. Common sources of nitrogen oxides: cars and trucks, power plants and industrial boilers. EPA sets limits on the concentration of ozonethe primary component of smog, in the air. Areas that fail to meet the standard are designated in ""nonattainment."" Under the Clean Air Act, the state is required to submit plans to EPA that outline how it will clean up areas and meet the federal standard. Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for the governor's office, said Perry's May letter to Obama focuses on ozone levels and nitrogen oxide emissions because ""ozone is the only thing that we are in nonattainment for the state. And NOx is a precursor to ozone, so it makes sense to highlight that."" Experts agreed with that reasoning. David Allen, a professor of chemical engineering at the University of Texas, said: ""Controlling NOx emissions is, in general, the most effective strategy for reducing ozone in Texas. So, the governor was right to focus on NOx."" The Texas Commission on Environmental Quality provided us with data showing a 46 percent reduction in emissions of nitrogen oxide from industrial sources such as chemical plants, refineries and electric utility plants between 2000 and 2006. Considering the drop through 2008, the decrease was even bigger: 53 percent. However, industrial sources account for only about a fourth of NOx emissions in Texas. Most come from road vehicles, ships and airplanes, as well as smaller sources such as gas stations and dry cleaners. Susana Hildebrand, TCEQ's chief engineer, told us Perry referenced industrial sources of pollution because that's mainly what the state regulates; the federal government regulates mobile sources. Considering all sources of nitrogen oxide emissions, the total fell 26 percent between 2002 and 2008. (The reduction since 2000 was not available.) As for ozone itself, establishing that statewide measure is complicated. There are about 70 regulatory ozone monitors in Texas, primarily in urban areas, almost all located on or east of the Interstate 35 corridor. The statewide measure is the three-year average of ozone levels from sites with some of the highest readings. TCEQ said it believes the sites were all in Houston or Dallas. The data show a 22 percent reduction in ozone between 2000 and 2008. In short, said UT's Allen, Perry's ozone figure is in line with what the agency and university researchers have found. ""All of these measurements paint a consistent picture. Ozone concentrations are going down across the state,"" he said. Still, some parts of Texas have struggled to meet federal ozone standards. Three regions are currently designated in nonattainment under a limit set by EPA in 1997: Dallas-Forth Worth (nine counties), Houston (eight counties), and Beaumont-Port Arthur (four counties). According to TCEQ, the Beaumont area is being reclassified as in compliance and the Houston area met the standard for the first time in 2009. But a tightening of EPA standards, expected in August, will likely put several more areas, including the five-county Austin region, out of compliance. Next, to what degree were the reductions in ozone and NOx achieved by the state's ""clean-air program""? Allen said that it's difficult to say ""quantitatively"" whether federal or state regulations were primarily responsible. Indeed, we found disagreement among experts on that front. Hildebrand, of TCEQ, said state efforts deserve full credit for the industrial NOx emission reductions, pointing to initiatives designed to bring regions into compliance with federal ozone standards. An example: the Mass Emissions Cap and Trade program, in place in Houston since 2001, which limits NOx emissions from large sources. But Neil Carman, clean air program director of the environmental group Sierra Club of Texas, said the federal government deserves the vast majority of the credit for reducing industrial NOx pollution because state actions have been driven by the Clean Air Act. And vehicle emissions, which are regulated by the feds and are a greater source of NOx pollution than industrial sources, have gone down as well -- 40 percent by TCEQ's measure between 2002 and 2008. Hildebrand acknowledged that has helped improve Texas' ozone picture. Al Armendariz of Dallas, administrator of EPA's multi-state Region 6, which includes Texas, credited all levels of government with hastening the ozone improvements, especially in Dallas and Houston. As examples, he pointed to enforcement actions taken against industry by the federal government that led to facilities' agreeing to major cuts in emissions, as well as state initiatives. The state touts incentive-driven programs such as its Emission Reduction Plan, which has spent more than $760 million since 2000 to help companies retrofit or replace more than 12,000 diesel vehicles with cleaner-burning ones. Despite the ozone improvements, a report released April 28 by the American Lung Association ranked the Houston area as the seventh-worst in the nation for ozone pollution and Dallas-Fort Worth 13th. (The worst six places for ozone were in California.) Of the 30 Texas counties graded by the lung association on their ozone pollution, 21 -- including Travis -- received F's. So how does Perry's statement hold up? The governor accurately cites recent improvements in the state's ozone levels. As for the NOx emissions contributing to ozone levels, his statistic refers to only one source -- industrial -- which he did not note. Nearly three-quarters comes from other sources. Whether the state gets the credit for those improvements is another issue. Even if TCEQ is responsible for the drop in industrial NOx emissions, federal efforts -- namely vehicle emission regulations -- also have helped lower ozone levels. Significantly, the state's ozone-related programs exist to help Texas comply with federal expectations. We rate Perry's statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA6A300>],/factchecks/2010/jun/16/rick-perry/perry-state-has-cut-ozone-22-nitrogen-oxide-emissi/

Group's ad attacks Rick Scott over history as Columbia/HCA CEO
","With his multi-millions and meteoric rise to frontrunner status in the Republican gubernatorial primary, former Columbia/HCA hospital CEO Rick Scott has become a formidable figure in Florida politics.Look no further than a new attack ad by Florida First Initiative that paints Scott as a ruthless moneyman whose success hinged on shunning the nation's poor, and in at least one incident, the near-dead. The shadow group, a 527 under federal tax code, has used rival Bill McCollum's name in its fundraising pitch and is unregistered in Florida.Attack ads generally try to undermine an opposing camp, and the rancor seeping from this ad campaign comes across as a screaming alarm bell. ""As CEO, Rick Scott profited from the largest Medicare fraud in American history,"" begins Refused, a 30-second spot that began airing June 12, 2010. ""His hospitals illegally refused emergency room patients who were poor. They turned away sick people... and pregnant women.""The ad is set against a backdrop of images of seemingly frail elderly men and women and a harrowing score.The most shocking claim comes near the end of the ad: ""A top executive said they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door."" The words, ""they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door"" flash across the screen.The $616,282 TV ad buy is scheduled to air through Wednesday -- two days before the state election filing deadline.Scott's opponents have rarely missed the opportunity to point out his corporate troubles. Scott was CEO of Columbia/HCA in 1997 when federal agents made public an investigation into the company. Scott resigned that year. He notes that he was never indicted and says he was never questioned in the case. In a 2000 settlement, the company agreed to plead guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies, including three counts of conspiracy to defraud the United States, and pay a $1.7 billion fine. But the claim that a man died at one of the company's hospitals after being turned away was new to us. Could it be true? Federal records list Alachua County GOP Chairman Stafford Jones as the contact for Florida First Initiative. Reached by phone, he declined to answer questions and did not return a request for comment. The group's registered agent, Ken Cleary, hung up on a reporter when reached by phone. The ad attributes the allegation to an ABC News 20/20 interview from Sept. 26, 1997. We found no reference in the 20/20 transcript to ""they even turned away a poor man and left him to die outside their door."" We also searched a newspaper database and found no references to those exact words. The interview features Marc Gardner, a former Columbia administrator who went on a 1997 media blitz, including the appearance on 20/20, in a bid to secure a book deal about the hospital chain's alleged illegal dealings. Among his many allegations of wrongdoing, Gardner claimed the hospital and other facilities owned by Columbia/HCA limited treatment of uninsured patients. ""Columbia hospitals exist to make money -- period,"" he told the Wall Street Journal in 1997. Gardner pointed to several deaths tied to improper care at the hospitals, including a 1995 case involving Adolph Anguiano, a homeless man who was found dead outside the Las Vegas hospital -- where Gardner served as vice president -- hours after he was examined by an emergency room doctor. We couldn't reach Gardner for comment. Scott's campaign attributed the allegation to Gardner in an e-mail response to the ad. The campaign dismissed Gardner as a ""publicity hungry wannabe writer"" and insisted the hospital did not turn Anguiano away. Rather, he was evaluated and then discharged. The emergency room physician, Susan Meyer, was later suspended over the incident, Scott's campaign said.With Meyer's name, we tracked down court records that detail the July 1995 death.On the day he died, Anguiano was found unconscious on the lawn of a hotel and taken by ambulance to Columbia Sunrise Hospital in Las Vegas. Meyer gave him a full physical, but decided against further tests, according to court records. Anguiano had not eaten in three days and had been drinking and smoking marijuana. He was given some juice and crackers, and hospital security escorted him out. He was found dead on the hospital grounds two hours later. Hospital officials said Meyer treated Anguiano for roughly seven minutes, which violated hospital rules, according to court records. Meyer was suspended. She sued the hospital and lost. The Nevada Supreme Court eventually concluded the hospital acted with the reasonable belief that it was furthering quality care. Hospital officials said they worried Anguiano's death might be seen as new evidence of ""patient dumping,"" or refusal to treat patients in need of emergency care, according to court records. Federal law prohibits emergency rooms from turning away patients because they don't have insurance. Columbia Sunrise had already been under investigation for denying care to uninsured patients after a homeless person passed out at a casino shortly after being released from the hospital in 1994, according to multiple news reports. Federal officials threatened to take away the hospital's Medicare contract until a second investigation a few weeks later found the hospital was providing emergency beds to the uninsured. Columbia Sunrise wasn't the only Columbia/HCA hospital hounded by reports of patient dumping. From 1988 to 1997, Columbia/HCA was fined at least $180,000 for alleged patient dumping violations at eight hospitals, according to news accounts. In all of those settlements, the company did not admit wrongdoing. Where does all that leave us? We know a former Columbia/HCA executive did complain about the company's alleged penchant for patient dumping. In several interviews, he discussed the death of Adolph Anguiano, a homeless man who was found on hospital property. Court records confirm Anguiano died outside a Columbia/HCA hospital and that the hospital was under scrutiny for mistreating poor patients. But Anguiano was not turned away, as the ad claims. He received some care before he was shown the door. Also, court records state Anguiano wasn't intentionally left to die.So while what happened to Anguiano is an ugly tale, it is not as ugly as the story portrayed in the attack ad. We rule this Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB96B6C0>],/factchecks/2010/jun/15/florida-first-initiative/groups-ad-attacks-rick-scott-over-history-columbia/

BP bringing claims centers to Florida, Charlie Crist says
","Among the Gulf state governors, Florida Gov. Charlie Crist has been the most supportive, or maybe least critical, of the federal government's response to the Deepwater Horizon oil explosion.But that hasn't stopped him from tossing some jabs at perhaps an easier target -- BP.In an interview with CNN's Candy Crowley, Crist echoed comments by Chief Financial Officer Alex Sink that some Florida businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy because of BP's slow processing of claims. ""We are demanding that they do better,"" Crist said on June 6, 2010. ""And what I mean by that is that the attorney general, Bill McCollum, and I have asked former attorneys general Bob Butterworth and Jim Smith to set up a task force of lawyers in order to be prepared for additional compensation when that becomes necessary. And we are pretty certain that it will. We have some of the best attorneys in the country here in Florida. And they have dealt with issues like this in the past, some other maritime issues that we have had to be faced with. So we are putting that together.""But in the near term -- in the short-term, if you will, we want these claims to be responded to much more quickly. BP is setting up claims offices throughout the state. But we want them to answer those claims more rapidly, because these people need help. And we have to be there to try to make them as whole as we can during this very difficult process. There are a lot of businesses impacted by it. It is not just restaurateurs and the hoteliers, it's fishermen, it's oyster fishermen and a lot of people along the coast who really depend on the Gulf of Mexico for their very livelihood.""With the oil spill continuing to threaten Florida, we wanted to check Crist's statement about the claims process, specifically if BP has set up offices throughout Florida.Under federal law, BP is obligated to pay for the cost to clean up the spill. But its liability is limited to $75 million when it comes to paying economic damage claims from businesses and people affected by the spill. BP has said it will pay all ""legitimate"" claims, even those beyond the $75 million cap, and some Democrats in Congress are considering whether to lift the $75 million cap and apply it to BP retroactively.BP has organized an extensive process to manage economic damage claims.The company announced on June 15 that it has paid out $16 million to businesses that have filed claims in excess of $5,000, and already issued 25,000 claims checks totalling $63 million. By June 20, BP says it will have paid out $85 million.Claims are coming in through BP's website, www.bp.com/claims and through a 1-800 number, company officials say.As Crist suggested, BP also has set up 25 claims centers scattered around the affected areas.There are 10 claims centers in Florida, more than any other state (Louisiana has seven, Alabama has five and Mississippi has three). Eight of the 10 Florida claims centers are clustered in the Panhandle, between Escambia County and Wakulla counties. The other two centers are in the Florida Keys in Key West and Marathon. You can see a complete list here. (If you're considering filing a claim in person, BP asks that you first get a claim number by calling 1-800-440-0858.)Crist said ""BP is setting up claims offices throughout the state,"" to help process economic damage claims from businesses and people affected by the Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion. BP has opened 10 claims centers in Florida, more than in any other state. Crist's use of the word ""throughout,"" kind of has us stumbling a bit. The claims centers are concentrated primarily in the Panhandle, with two others in the Florida Keys. There are no centers between Cedar Key and Naples on the west coast of the state and none on the east coast. While it is true that reports of oil have been concentrated to the Panhandle and the Keys, the spill has the potential to impact all parts of the state, regardless how close the oil is to the shore.Trying to balance it all out, we rate Crist's statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC648DC0>],/factchecks/2010/jun/15/charlie-crist/bp-bringing-claims-centers-florida-charlie-crist-s/

Hayworth says McCain voted against Bush tax cuts because they tilted toward the rich
","Less than two years after losing the 2008 presidential election, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is embroiled in a tough Republican primary against former Rep. J.D. Hayworth.In one recent ad, Hayworth attacked McCain for his vote on the two major tax cut bills of George W. Bush's presidency. ""McCain voted against the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003, wrongly claiming they helped only the rich,"" the ad says.We decided to see if Hayworth's ad correctly characterizes McCain's stance.Hayworth is correct that McCain voted against both the Economic Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 and the Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2003. In fact, he was one of just two Republicans to oppose the 2001 bill (along with the late John Chafee of Rhode Island) and one of three Republicans opposing the 2003 bill (along with Chafee and Olympia Snowe of Maine).Before going further, we should add that McCain has since changed his stance on the Bush tax cuts. When they came up for renewal in 2006, he voted in favor of extension, and during the 2008 campaign, he once again advocated for their extension. In fact, during the 2008 presidential campaign, PolitiFact gave McCain a Full Flop for his changed stance on the Bush tax cuts.But that's irrelevant for checking Hayworth's claim, since the ad only challenges McCain on his views at the time the bills were passed.So, back to the core charge of the ad. Did McCain say, as Hayworth alleges, that the bills ""helped only the rich""? The answer is: pretty much.In each case, before officially casting his vote, McCain gave a Senate floor speech to explain how he would be voting, and why. In both cases, he expressed regret that the bill would be targeting a disproportionate share of its benefits on wealthier Americans.In his 2001 speech, McCain said that he decided to vote against the final version of the bill after failing to find ""that the progress we made in the Senate bill to scale back the benefits going to the top rate taxpayers to make room for more tax relief to lower income Americans would prevail in the final tax bill. During the debate on the Senate version of the tax reconciliation bill, I had urged my colleagues that substantial tax relief to middle income Americans should be our top priority. ... I cannot in good conscience support a tax cut in which so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us, at the expense of middle-class Americans who most need tax relief.""Two years later, McCain spent much of his speech discussing his disappointment about the dropping of a provision he had backed that would have effectively reduced the tax burden of members of the armed forces and the foreign service stationed overseas. However, in the speech he also restated his concern about the share of benefits in the bill flowing to richer Americans.""Despite the recent successful war in Iraq, which highlighted the bravery and sacrifice of our military, the conferees provided nothing for them in this so-called growth bill,"" McCain said. ""The only thing growing will be the tax breaks for the wealthiest citizens of this country.""Later in the speech, he added, ""Mr. President, the case is clear. The conferees should have included the Armed Forces Tax Fairness Act of 2003 in the conference report for this tax relief bill. If they can look into the eyes of all the men and women in our military who have committed themselves to the defense of this country in Iraq and elsewhere around the world, and justify how they spent billions of federal dollars to cut taxes for our nation’s wealthiest at their expense, then the process is clearly broken. And that is a disgrace for which they are solely responsible.""So when he had the opportunity to explain his thinking to the Senate and the American public, McCain on both occasions cited the disproportionate benefits for the rich. That gets Hayworth's ad most of the way home.But Hayworth's assertion that McCain ""wrongly"" claimed that the cuts ""helped only the rich"" does bring up two additional questions. First, did the tax cuts actually help only the rich? While the bills' benefits were concentrated among those with the highest incomes, taxpayers in all income levels did get some benefit. The Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the centrist-to-liberal Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, looked at all of the Bush-backed tax cuts enacted between 2001 and 2008 (which included, but was not limited to, the 2001 and 2003 bills) and found that the richest one-fifth of the population saw its after-tax income rise by 5.4 percent. The second one-fifth saw income rise by 3.5 percent, while the third one-fifth saw income rise by 2.6 percent and the fourth one-fifth saw income rise by 2.5 percent. The lowest one-fifth clearly fared the poorest, with an income boost of 0.7 percent. So it's certainly fair for Hayworth to knock the notion that the only people to benefit from the tax cuts were the wealthy. But is that what McCain said in his speeches? The answer is mixed.In 2001, McCain said that ""so many of the benefits go to the most fortunate among us"" -- which is not the same as saying that ""all of the benefits"" would go to the rich. However, two years later, McCain did suggest something closer to what the ad charges -- that ""the only thing growing"" as a result of the 2003 bill ""will be the tax breaks for the wealthiest citizens of this country.""So let's sum up. McCain voted against the tax cuts, as the ad indicated, and he cited the idea that the bills were tilted toward the rich as a major reason for his votes. When discussing one of the bills, McCain did suggest that only the rich would benefit, while for the other bill, he didn't. Because the ad was partly wrong on this final point, we'll mark it down a notch. But in general, the ad is quite accurate. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7EC240>],/factchecks/2010/jun/15/jd-hayworth/hayworth-says-mccain-voted-against-bush-tax-cuts-b/

McCain accuses Hayworth of earning 'thousands' as a Washington lobbyist
","Less than two years after losing the 2008 presidential election, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is embroiled in a tough Republican primary against former Rep. J.D. Hayworth. In one recent TV ad, McCain attacks Hayworth for claiming to be an outsider. The ad shows a limousine driving by a fancy building and then an unflattering black-and-white clip of Hayworth sharing the screen with an airborne corporate jet and floating paper money. ""J.D. Hayworth says he's an outsider, but after he was voted out of Congress he became a registered lobbyist,"" the narrator intones. ""Hayworth was paid thousands by a Florida corporation to lobby the very committee he used to serve on."" We decided to check to see if this description is accurate. First, the add is correct that Hayworth was voted out of office. He lost in the landslide of 2006 to his Democratic challenger, Harry Mitchell. Now for the lobbying claim. By law, all registered lobbyists must periodically file disclosure forms with the U.S. House and Senate, and we were able to locate two filed by Hayworth. In February 2008, Hayworth filed a form serving notice that he would be a paid lobbyist for the Wealth Transfer Group, based in Altamonte Springs, Fla. A separate but related form filed two months later disclosed that Hayworth was paid $10,000 by his client.The forms also say that Hayworth's subject areas for lobbying would be tax and copyright issues. The tax issue falls squarely within the jurisdiction of the House Ways and Means Committee, which used to count Hayworth among its members.Based on contemporary news accounts, it's likely that the Wealth Transfer Group hired Hayworth to lobby against possible restrictions on patenting ""tax reduction strategies."" These are approaches to limiting one's tax liability that are so unique that they have been granted patents by the federal government. The Wealth Transfer Group owns -- and has defended in court -- a patent on a technique for limiting the tax liability on certain kinds of stock options. The company's website says that the company only works on estates exceeding $10 million.In 2007, the Wall Street Journal reported that the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants ""wrote leaders of several congressional committees urging them to limit tax-strategy patents.

Oil Pollution Act trips up Brazile on ABC's 'This Week'
","Democratic strategist Donna Brazile tried to rebut criticism that President Barack Obama isn't doing enough to control the Gulf of Mexico oil spill response, arguing on ABC's This Week that he has been hamstrung by the actions of Congress 20 years ago.In a back and forth with former labor secretary Robert Reich, Brazile said Congress created a policy that puts BP -- not the federal government -- in charge of the response.""The present spectacle of the Coast Guard asking BP to speed up this clean-up is absurd. I mean, the federal government needs to be in charge,"" Reich, a former Labor Secretary under President Bill Clinton, said. ""The president needs to be in charge of this. Use BP's expertise. Use BP's resources. But the president must be in charge of all of this. Otherwise, he looks like he's just standing on the sidelines.""""Well,"" Brazile said, ""the administration has been constrained by the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, which basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem,"" Brazile responded. ""That has been the problem from day one. They've waited for BP to come up with the answers, and we know that BP continues to mislead people.""In this fact-check, we wanted to see if Brazile's interpretation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 is right -- particularly when it comes to deciding who has the lead role. The Oil Pollution Act of 1990 was passed in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez spill in Prince William Sound in 1989. The law was designed to better coordinate the government response to a major oil event, and to set penalties for companies responsible. It was approved by Congress and signed into law on Aug. 18, 1990.In general, it gives the president more authority in an oil event, not less.""When responding to a spill, many considered the lines of responsibility under the pre-OPA regime to be unclear, with too much reliance on spillers to perform proper cleanup,"" according to a Congressional Research Service report. ""OPA strengthened and clarified the federal government's role in oil spill response and cleanup.""The Oil Pollution Act included amendments to the Clean Water Act to provide the president three options in the wake of an oil event, the Congressional Research Service concluded. The president could: The Environmental Protection Agency describes the OPA this way: ""The OPA improved the nation's ability to prevent and respond to oil spills by establishing provisions that expand the federal government's ability, and provide the money and resources necessary, to respond to oil spills.""BP ultimately is liable for the cost of cleaning up the spilled oil. The Oil Pollution Act caps additional economic damages at $75 million, but BP has said it will pay all legitimate claims, and some Democrats in Congress want to lift the cap and apply it retroactively. President Obama has said he wants to update the laws to ""make sure that the people in the Gulf, the fishermen, the hotel owners, families who are dependent for their livelihoods in the Gulf, that they are all made whole and that we are in a much better position to respond to any such crisis in the future.""Still, under the law as it stands today, BP will be paying for the clean-up, and the federal government -- thanks to the OPA -- ultimately has authority over how the clean-up proceeds.We asked Brazile, a native of New Orleans who still has family living there, if there was something we were missing.Brazile said she was trying to point out that the Oil Pollution Act, and the options the president had, may have contributed to the federal government not taking the lead sooner. ""The Administration had every reason to take the lead and not wait,"" Brazile said. ""Perhaps they waited -- and I used the reference to the Act -- as one reason why they did not take the initial lead."" Brazill also suggested her statement -- which was criticized by the conservative website Newsbusters -- was being used to score political points in the middle of a national crisis. Her first concern, she said, is that people in the Gulf states suffering get help.But in this case, her interpretation of the Oil Pollution Act of 1990, is incorrect. She said the law ""basically gives the responsible party the lead role in trying to not only fix the problem, but contain the problem."" In fact, the Oil Pollution Act specifcially gives the federal government the authority to decide who's in charge of the clean-up -- the polluter or the government. The company, in this case BP, will pay for the clean-up response. But the federal government can give the orders if it chooses. We rate Brazile's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAA19C0>],/factchecks/2010/jun/15/donna-brazile/oil-pollution-act-trips-brazile-abcs-week/

Brazile says Clinton loved by 90 percent of Arkansans
","Sen. Blanche Lincoln's narrow victory in the Arkansas Democratic primary was a big topic on ABC's This Week on Sunday, June 13, 2010. Organized labor poured $10 million into the campaign of her opponent, Lt. Gov. Bill Halter, while Bill Clinton, who served as Arkansas governor before becoming president, came out in strong support for Lincoln.  This Week host Jake Tapper began the conversation by showing a clip of White House spokesman Robert Gibbs criticizing the unions for not using that money to help in the general election. Tapper asked Democratic strategist Donna Brazile, ""Is the White House risking alienating labor with that kind of talk?""   Brazile responded that the White House should be careful about alienating labor because unions provide key grass-roots support.  Brazile said that ""Blanche Lincoln ran a great campaign. She ran against Washington. Labor, the money did make her the outsider. She was able to reconnect with her base, and she pulled her base out. She still has trouble in the general election, but she ran a very smart, strategic campaign.""  Brazile added, ""And Bill Clinton helped her. He is popular. Ninety percent of the people in the state still love him. And he was able to pull out the stops to get her elected.""  We were curious about the claim that 90 percent of the people in Arkansas still love Bill Clinton. That number seemed high, so we e-mailed Brazile to ask her source. She replied that she was referring to the ""base of the Democratic party"" and not ALL people. It was a Democratic run-off and I did not set it up right (in the comment on the show) because we had so many races to cover.""  Brazile said she was sorry about not providing the context and that she thought it was clear she was talking about Democratic primary voters.   But we watched the clip and thought many people might think she meant Clinton was popular with 90 percent of all people in Arkansas. His nationwide numbers are significantly lower. In a CNN/Opinion Research Corporation poll dated from October 2009, 64 percent of those polled said that they had a favorable opinion of Clinton. We would expect him to be more popular in his home state, but we doubt his popularity would be 26 points higher. Brazile acknowledged that would be highly unlikely ""in this highly charged partisan environment.""  But for Democratic primary voters, Brazile is on solid ground. She sent us a poll from Lake Research Partners of likely Democratic primary voters in Arkansas that found 86 percent had a favorable approval rating of Clinton.  So Brazile was very close with her number, but she left out an important detail -- that it applied only to Democratic primary voters. Still, it was made in the context of a discussion about the Democratic primary. So we find her claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB99E580>],/factchecks/2010/jun/15/donna-brazile/brazile-says-clinton-loved-90-percent-arkansans/

Barnes suggests mining the Capitol for education gold
","Okay, okay. We here at PolitiFact Georgia know that politicians are occasionally given to hyperbole. From time to time the political class seems driven to test the bounds of rhetorical gravity. And we feel inclined to test what they say. Take former Gov. Roy Barnes, a skilled orator and shrewd trial lawyer who to can turn on the aw-shucks routine with the best of them. Earlier this year, Barnes spoke in Summerville as part of the Chattooga County Chamber of Commerce’s annual meeting. And man-oh-man did he ever come up with the money quote as noted in the Chattanooga Times Free Press, which reported it in a news story about his speech. ""If we have to scrape the gold off the gold dome, you make sure that education comes first,"" Mr. Barnes told the group, according to the news article. He made the same claim in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution in an opinion piece he penned in 2008. “If  we have to scrape the gold off the Capitol dome to do it, so be it. It's worth it, and we owe it to our children,’ Barnes wrote. The state’s schools are in tough shape due to the grinding recession that has withered property values and diminished state and local coffers. The schools now need billions to avoid furloughs, layoffs and school closings. Chris Carpenter, Barnes’ campaign manager, said Barnes made the statement to show how important he considers education. The former governor has also mentioned closing the Governor’s Mansion and the state Capitol – the same one he wants to relieve of its gold top – to raise money for state schools. “He just thinks public education is the No 1 priority,” Carpenter said.  “Obviously there is some rhetorical flourish there.” Flourish, smourish. We wanted to know how much the state could get if it the gold leaf was actually scraped off the venerable old dome and sold. Not a lot, as it turns out, despite the fact that gold has recently surged past $1,200 an ounce. Gold first graced the dome after a late 1950s Capitol renovation in which the old tin-covered dome as was done up in 43 ounces of the glittering stuff. It was milled to 1/5000th of an inch thick before being affixed to the roof. The gold originally traveled to Atlanta from Dahlonega, site of the nation’s first gold rush, in a caravan of seven mule-drawn covered wagons, which took three days to reach Atlanta. The gold was expected to last thirty or forty years but by the late 1970s it had deteriorated to the point that the dome to be re-gilded, a project completed in 1981. Mike Kramer, owner and president of The Gilder’s Studio, runs the Maryland-based company that re-gilded the dome again in 1998. Workers first scraped off what was left of the old gold. “We had people that parked at the Capitol complaining because we were getting gold scrapings on their cars,” Kramer said in a telephone interview. Kramer reckons his company used about 85 ounces of gold gilding material. He said the new dome should be good for another 20 or even 30 years – as long as politicians don’t start scraping on it. As for Barnes’ idea about cashing in on the shiny Capitol covering, Kramer was, well, less than enthusiastic. “You’d have to dry scrape it off, and I’d probably charge a hundred-grand for that,” he said.  “Then you have to contain it. Then you have to refine because it’s attached to the zinc-chromate primer.” Kramer figured that only about 60 ounces of the original gold could be salvaged. A refiner would charge you 20 percent or so to extract it once it was scraped off, he said. So at $1,200 an ounce, you get about $72,000 for 60 ounces. Subtract the refiner’s fee and you’re down to $57,600. By the time you pay Kramer his $100,000 for scraping the orb in the first place, you are actually in the hole by more than $40,000. “You’re not going to make any money,” Kramer said. In fact you would lose money, and end up with a naked Capitol dome. And nobody wants that. We give the former governor a Pants On Fire for this one.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAA1880>],/factchecks/2010/jun/15/roy-barnes/barnes-suggests-mining-state-capitol-education-gol/
"['Abortion', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio claims Gov. Crist's veto of abortion bill clears the way for taxpayer funded abortions
","The highly-charged debate over a Florida abortion bill has turned to one of the most controversial aspects of the recently enacted federal health care law.While legislators for weeks focused on the issue of ultrasounds for women seeking an abortion, the law also would have prohibited women who get government subsidies for health insurance from purchasing insurance policies that cover abortions.When Gov. Charlie Crist vetoed the bill, former Florida House Speaker and Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio promptly released a statement that ""Gov. Crist’s veto also clears the way for taxpayer funding of abortion in Florida.""The statement, however, is based on a misleading assumption about the national health care law.First, a few words about the federal law. It will create state-run health insurance exchanges in which private companies will compete for the business of people who do not get insurance through their employers. The idea is that it will allow individuals to get group rates enjoyed by those in big employer plans. People who cannot afford insurance will get government subsidies to offset the cost of purchasing a plan in the exchange. How to deal with abortion in the health care exchanges predictably became a thorny political issue that threatened the law's very passage, and several alternatives were considered. The final language signed into law, crafted by abortion opponent Sen. Ben Nelson, D-Neb., will allow insurance companies in the exchange to offer abortion services, even to people who get federal subsidies. But Nelson's provision specifically prohibits the use of federal dollars to fund abortions, except in the case of rape, incest or when the mother's life in peril. Rather, insurance companies would be required to pay for abortion services from a segregated pool of money funded through patient premiums. Essentially, people who select plans that cover abortions would have to pay at least $1 a month of their premiums into a separate account. Any abortion services provided by the insurer would have to be drawn from that segregated account.The national health care law also gives states an opt-out. States could pass laws to prohibit abortion coverage in health plans offered on the state exchange if they chose. That's what Florida's HB 1143 attempted to do. Section 101 of the bill states, ""A health insurance policy or group health insurance policy purchased in whole or in part with state or federal funds through an exchange created pursuant to the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act may not provide coverage for an (elective) abortion ... A policy is deemed to be purchased with state or federal funds if it is a policy toward which any tax credit or cost-sharing credit is applied.""Again, Crist vetoed that bill.But the rhetoric on this issue can be tricky. For example, Florida House Republicans were right when they said in a press release after Crist's veto that ""Recent federal health care legislation gave states the opportunity to opt-out of federal provisions using tax dollars ... to subsidize insurance plans that fund elective abortions."" Yes, the federal law would allow tax dollars to subsidize someone's policy even if the individual chose a plan that covers abortion. And so it would certainly be fair to say that many women who cannot currently afford health insurance will be given tax subsidies and many of them may choose plans that offer abortion services. But the House Republicans' release was wrong when it said the law would ""force Florida taxpayers to pay for elective abortions."" Any abortions would be paid through a separate account funded entirely through a portion of premiums paid by people who select a plan that covers abortion services, not from tax dollars. That's an important difference. Everyone who buys into a plan that covers abortion would have to pay into that abortion fund, even men. And for those with moral objections to paying a portion of their premiums for abortion services, the federal law requires that every region offer at least one alternative health plan that does not cover abortion.Before signing off on the abortion language in the national health care bill, Rep. Bart Stupak, D-Mich, persuaded President Barack Obama to issue an executive order providing a way to ensure two checks go to insurers every month, so that abortion dollars and federal dollars are not commingled. And Stupak, who up until that point had been the champion of the abortion foes' position, declared, ""There will be no public funding for abortion in this legislation."" We agree. That was the case before Crist vetoed the Florida bill. And it's true after. Abortion foes argue the federal rules are little more than an accounting trick, that if federal subsidies go to someone who chooses a plan that covers abortion, it's the same as taxpayer-funded abortion. But we think it's misleading to call it taxpayer-funded abortion when the law requires abortions be paid solely through a portion of the premiums (not tax dollars) paid by people who choose a plan that covers abortions.We rule Rubio's statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC025200>],/factchecks/2010/jun/14/marco-rubio/marco-rubio-claims-gov-crists-veto-abortion-bill-c/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'This Week - ABC News', 'Steny Hoyer']","
Hoyer says GOP 'didn't have a budget' in 2002, 2004, 2006
","On the June 13, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, D-Md., and House Minority Leader John Boehner, R-Ohio, got into a back-and-forth over how diligent lawmakers have been in passing a budget in recent years.Hoyer said that ""the Republicans didn't have a budget in '02, '04, '06,"" while Boehner claimed ""the House has never failed to pass a budget in the modern era.""With dueling claims like these, we had no choice but to step in and play referee. In this item, we'll look at what Hoyer said; in a separate item, we'll look at Boehner's comment.First, a little background. The budget process used by Congress today was set forth in the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Both the Senate and the House are supposed to pass resolutions in the spring that outline the framework for future bills that address spending, taxation and other fiscal policy items. This budget represents a plan for allocating revenues and expenditures for the coming fiscal year, as well as for the next four fiscal years in more general terms. Each chamber is supposed to pass a version of the resolution, and if the two versions differ, then the chambers jointly hammer out a compromise and pass it.The budget process is distinct from the series of appropriations, or spending, bills that actually allocate money for specific purposes. Unlike the appropriations bills, the budget resolution doesn't carry the force of law. In fact, unlike a law, the budget resolution is not signed by the president after it passes both chambers. If a budget resolution does not pass, the majority can still use parliamentary procedures to proceed to appropriations bills, but the inability to pass the budget framework can reflect poorly on the majority's organizational skills and/or the degree of partisan discord in Congress. It also increases the likelihood of a logjam of appropriations bills in the fall and winter, and decreases the chance that controversial tax bills will pass the Senate.That's why the expected failure of the Democratic House majority to pass a budget for fiscal year 2011 has become a talking point for Republicans.According to the Congressional Research Service, the nonpartisan research arm of Congress, the House has indeed passed a budget every year since the Congressional Budget Act first took effect for fiscal year 1976. So if the House does not pass a budget for fiscal year 2011, it will be the first time since the current rules went into force. So on this point, we rated Boehner's comment True.However, we should also note that the House has not always been joined by the Senate in passing a budget -- a factor that explains the difference between what Boehner and Hoyer said. Since 1983 -- the first year the House and Senate stopped passing two budget resolutions annually and began passing one per year -- the two chambers failed to pass a joint budget bill on four occasions. For fiscal year 2003, the Senate, then under Democratic control, failed to pass a budget resolution of any kind, and on three other occasions (fiscal years 1999, 2005 and 2007) the House and Senate failed to reconcile their different bills and pass a compromise measure. In these latter three cases, the Republicans were in the majority in both chambers of Congress.Because Congress always works on the budget resolution for the coming fiscal year, Hoyer is right that a unified Republican Congressional majority failed to pass a finished budget in 2004 and 2006. Hoyer failed to mention the GOP's failure in 1998. Moreover, the Republicans can't be solely faulted for the failure in 2002 to pass a fiscal 2003 budget, because the Democrats controlled the Senate and were unable to pass a budget resolution.  So Hoyer's comment is not entirely accurate, and is less precise than Boehner's comment because he didn't specify if he was talking about the House, the Senate or Republicans as a whole. As our related fact-check of Boehner's comment shows, the House Republicans did indeed pass an initial budget resolution every time they ran the process as the majority party, even though on three occasions the GOP was not able to pass a final budget through both chambers. For Hoyer, we rate his comment Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6E6AC0>],/factchecks/2010/jun/14/steny-hoyer/hoyer-says-gop-didnt-have-budget-2002-2004-2006/
