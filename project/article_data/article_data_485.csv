Bill White says most of Gov. Rick Perry's chiefs of staff have been lobbyists
","
Democratic gubernatorial nominee Bill White has vowed to tighten rules restricting state employees from working as lobbyists, recently noting that Perry's top staffers have kept the revolving door spinning. 
""Most of his chiefs of staff have been lobbyists,"" White said to a crowd of about 35 people in the North Texas town of Crowell on Aug. 14. 
White was more specific in an ethics reform proposal he released in April: ""Five of seven Perry chiefs of staff have been lobbyists.""  
Quick aside: State law regulates lobbying, defined as ""direct communications"" with members of state agencies, the legislative or executive branch of state government to influence legislation or administrative action. That includes the offices of the governor. 
White proposed to prohibit the governor's senior staff from working on issues related to their former employment for two years. And ""when departing, they will be prohibited from lobbying the governor's office or their state agency for two years,"" according to White's plan. 
Mark Miner, a spokesman for Perry's campaign, has said that ""the governor has some of the toughest ethics policies anywhere in the country,"" according to a Aug. 19 article in the Dallas Morning News. ""You cannot lobby his office for one year and a legislative session."" 
Still, we wondered if White's chiefs-of-staff complaint was true. 
So we went down the roster of the governor's chiefs of staff and combed through the Texas Ethics Commission's online database of registered lobbyists, who are required to report their compensation and expenditures. But that list only dates back to 1998, so we reached out to the former chiefs of staff themselves. 
Introducing ... 
Barry McBee chief of staff, December 2000-August 2001; registered lobbyist 2001-02McBee was the first of the seven chiefs of staff Perry has had during his gubernatorial tenure. McBee has also been chairman of the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission, deputy commissioner at the Texas Department of Agriculture and an aide to former Gov. Bill Clements. 
McBee was a lobbyist when he worked for the law firm Bracewell & Patterson (now Bracewell & Giuliani). The ethics commission lists nine clients for McBee, including AT&T and defense contractor Northrop Grumman, in 2002, his most recent year as a lobbyist. The commission reports McBee's compensation from the law firm that year as at least $200,000. 
Where's McBee now? At the University of Texas System, where's he's worked as vice chancellor for governmental relations since 2006 — also a lobbying job, albeit for a public institution. 
Mike McKinney chief of staff, September 2001-November 2002; registered lobbyist 1999-2001 
McKinney served in the Texas House of Representatives from 1984 to 1991 and led the Texas Health and Human Services Commission during George W. Bush's first term as governor. McKinney was registered as a lobbyist from 1999 to August 2001 while he was a vice president of Centene Corp., a St. Louis-based health insurance company. Rod Davis, a spokesman at the Texas A&M University System, where McKinney is now chancellor, said he had ""registered as a lobbyist as a standard precaution for having any contacts with legislators"" but ""was not primarily a 'lobbyist' by any means."" 
Mike Toomey chief of staff December 2002-September 2004; registered lobbyist 1990-2002, 2004-present 
The ethics commission database lists more than 30 clients, including Merck and Philip Morris, for Toomey in 2002, the year he became Perry's chief of staff. 
Since leaving the Perry administration, Toomey has resumed lobbying. Among his 25 clients listed for 2010 on the ethics commission report are AT&T, Corrections Corp. of America, Hewlett-Packard and Texas Instruments. This year, Toomey reported a minimum of $800,000 and a maximum of about $1.5 million in prospective compensation, according to the commission. 
Deirdre Delisi chief of staff September 2004-June 2007  
Delisi has been with Perry since he was lieutenant governor. She served as his chief of staff until Perry tapped her to serve as the chairwoman of the Texas Transportation Commission, which governs the Texas Department of Transportation. 
Delisi told us that she has never been a registered lobbyist, and after searching news clips and lobbyist registries dating from 1998 on the ethics commission website, we confirmed as much. 
Brian Newby chief of staff July 2007-October 2008; registered lobbyist 2009-present 
Newby rejoined the law firm Cantey Hanger in 2009 after working for Perry and registered as a lobbyist the same year. This year, the Tarrant Regional Water District was listed as his client, and his prospective compensation from the district was reported as $10,000 to $24,999.99. 
Jay Kimbrough chief of staff October 2008-June 2009 
Kimbrough, a former Marine, has in recent years filled a troubleshooter role at the Texas Youth Commission and the Texas Department of Transportation. Prior, he was a special adviser to the Texas A&M board of regents. 
Kimbrough told us that he's never been a lobbyist, and we didn't find any evidence to the contrary. 
Ray Sullivan chief of staff July 2009-present; registered lobbyist 2002-09  
Katherine Cesinger, a spokeswoman for Perry, told us that Sullivan first registered as a lobbyist in late 2002, although he doesn't show up in the ethics commission database until 2003. Before that, he worked in various capacities for Perry. Perry appointed him as chief of staff in July, prompting Wayne Slater at the Dallas Morning News to single Sullivan out as an example of ""how things work in Austin."" 
According to the Aug. 19 article, ""Ray has shuttled between top jobs on Perry’s staff and as a lobbyist representing interests with business before the state. His wife has directed the governor’s political fundraising. They haven’t broken the law or the rules governing the practice of politics and policy, and they’ve made between $4 million and $5.7 million since Perry’s been governor, according to campaign reports, lobby filings and state payroll records."" 
In 2009, Sullivan had seven clients listed to his name on the ethics website, including HNTP Corp., a toll-road engineering company. 
Seven chiefs of staff later, what have we learned? 
Far as we can tell, five have been registered as lobbyists, as White stated. Three of those — McKinney, Toomey and Sullivan — were lobbyists before Perry hired them as chief of staff. 
We rate White's statement as True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD19D80>],/factchecks/2010/aug/30/bill-white/bill-white-says-most-gov-rick-perrys-chiefs-staff-/

King says Rhode Island's public employees have 150 different pension plans
","
Kernan ""Kerry"" King, the Republican candidate for general treasurer, believes the public employee pension system is too complicated.

""In Rhode Island today, our little state, there are 150 different pension plans for public workers. That's absolutely crazy,"" he said during an appearance on Newsmakers. ""We need to have one plan for all workers, whether you're a judge, whether you're a state trooper, whether you work for the city of Warwick as a maintenance person. One plan should fit every single person.""

One hundred fifty is a lot of pension plans, even for a state with 39 cities and towns.

So we first checked with the general treasurer's office, which handles the state-run programs.

Chief of Staff Mark A. Dingley said the state has four such programs and he sent us the latest audit reports for all of them.

Most state employees and teachers are covered by the Employees' Retirement System of Rhode Island (ERSRI). The state employees portion of that system was funded at 59 percent for 24,661 employees and retirees as of June 30, 2009, the most recent figures available. The teachers portion was funded at 58.1 percent for 25,904 employees and retirees. Ideally, both should be at 100 percent.

Then there's the State Police Retirement Benefits Trust, which covered 182 people as of June 30, 2009. It has 79.8 percent of the money it should have to be fully funded, according to last year's actuarial valuation.

Third is the Judicial Retirement Benefits Trust for the state's judges and retired judges. There were 55 in June 2009. The plan is funded at 88.3 percent.

Fourth is the state-run Municipal Employees' Retirement System (MERS) which covers 109 pension programs within various cities, towns or region. As of last year, it covered 7,952 employees and 4,389 retirees. All 109 programs are funded separately to various degrees by their municipality. Thirty six are funded at 100 percent or higher, and 10 have less than 70 percent of the money they should have.

The four programs actually represent 113 different named pension plans, if you count the program for teachers and other state employees as two separate ones. Dingley said all 113 have very similar provisions.

On the state level, there are five different designs of pension plans. 

But wait, there's more.

There are 36 municipal pension programs in 24 communities that are administered by their respective cities and towns. ""They would all have different designs,"" said Dingley.

For information on them, we went to the Office of the Auditor General and found its March 2010 report assessing their health. Nearly two thirds of those plans are considered at risk because they don't have enough money to cover projected expenses.

Only 11 have at least 70 percent of the funding they need and 19 are funded below the 50 percent level. ""Some are so small they only cover one or two people,"" Dingley said.

That brings the total to 149, or 148 if you include the state teachers and state employees plans as one.

Dingley said he's not sure how easy it would be to combine them, as King is recommending. The ones that cover police and fire ""are designed very differently because of the hazardous nature of the work. You don't want to see a 60-year-old fireman or policeman still working, because they can't go up the ladder and carry someone down, or they're not effective against young criminals, etc.

""Likewise for judges, who tend to be appointed later in their careers, so those designs take that career track into account. Those have traditionally been different,"" said Dingley. ""But aside from that, there is a strong argument to be made that the rest should have a uniform design.""

The bigger question, given how poorly-funded some of the plans are, ""is who makes up the huge deficits,"" Dingley said.

Ultimately, King's count of the number of public pension plans in Rhode Island isn't perfect, but it's close enough for us, so we rate his statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC4BB40>],/factchecks/2010/aug/30/kernan-kerry-king/king-says-rhode-islands-public-employees-have-150-/

Block says system he helped create to detect welfare fraud has saved more than $1 billion
","
In a television commercial, Kenneth Block, the Moderate Party candidate for governor, tries to appeal to voters by suggesting that he is business savvy, concerned about the environment, and knows how to save taxpayer money.

""I built a successful high-tech business, created green jobs, and helped to invent a system that saved over a billion dollars on welfare,"" he says in the commercial, which is also available on his website.

We decided to focus on the welfare claim and the savings Block says he helped to generate.

First, Block isn't talking about Rhode Island. He said he is talking about software he helped develop for Texas, which in 1995 adopted a statewide debit card system for food stamp and welfare recipients. It computerized every transaction, eliminating, for example, the need for paper food stamps, which can be stolen or misused.

He's been more specific on his website blog: ""As a small business owner, Ken helped to invent a system that saved Texas over a billion dollars on welfare. He did this by eliminating waste and fraud in the system . . . "" 
Second, the $1 billion savings estimate comes from food stamps, not from welfare, which people often lump together because both are forms of public assistance. Block's campaign encouraged us to focus on the food stamp program because, they said, it would be easier to quantify the savings. 
How did Block's efforts help save this money? He said one technique is ""data mining,"" in which large amounts of information are analyzed to look for improprieties, such as a small grocery that reports the food sales numbers of a huge supermarket. He said sham storefronts were paying food stamp recipients 50 cents on the dollar for their stamps and then billing the state for the full amount when no food was actually sold. Such information helped direct investigators to crooked vendors and recipients, he said.

So there are two key questions: Did Block help create the fraud detection system and did it save $1 billion?

Geoffrey Wool, a spokesman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, said Block was an employee of GTECH when Texas contracted with the Rhode Island gambling company in the early 1990s to develop the EBT system. Wool said the Texas commission currently gets services from Simpatico Software Systems, the company Block started after he left GTECH.

Block also referred us to Curtis Ermer, one of his GTECH colleagues on the EBT project.

""Ken's role was large in terms of the design. Ken could sit down in a short period of time and optimize that code,"" said Ermer, who has since left GTECH. He said an anti-fraud component ""was a purpose of the whole EBT system. The counterfeiting of stamps, the multiple addresses people would use, was supposed to be reduced.""

Thus, it appears Block played a significant role in establishing the EBT system, so his ""helped to invent"" claim is True.

What about the second key question: Did that system save more than $1 billion? 
We were unable to locate any official report showing how much waste or fraud was eliminated by adoption of the EBT program. Block's campaign then directed us to several news reports from 1998 suggesting that the savings were large, although they widely disagreed on the amount saved:

* In an opinion piece in The Houston Chronicle, Joe Williams, president of the Gulf Coast Retailers Association, said the number of Texas households receiving food stamps and welfare benefits plummeted from 1.4 million in 1994 to 850,000 in 1998 due to the EBT card system, saving taxpayers more than $1.2 billion a year.

* A Dallas Morning News story quoted then-Texas Comptroller John Sharp as saying there had been a 250,000-person decline in food stamp rolls. At the time, a typical recipient was receiving about $70 in food stamps per month, according to a federal report we located independently. That would translate to a savings of $206 million per year.

*A San Antonio Express-News story quoted Sharp's office as reporting that the decline in food stamp enrollment saved $67.3 million a month. That would total more than $800 million in just one year.

The Block campaign also directed us to a March 1996 state newsletter, quoting Sharp as saying that when EBT went on-line in Houston in February 1995, 30,000 recipients immediately dropped off the food stamp rolls, including some who had been receiving food stamps at two or three different addresses.

It also reported that ""between January and October 1995, Texas' food stamp rolls shrank by nearly 200,000 recipients."" At $70 per month per person, the statewide savings would surpass $1 billion after six years and one month -- sooner if you factor in inflation.

All of this suggests that the EBT system indeed saved a lot of money in Texas.

But there were some dissenting voices.

We talked to Celia Hagert, a senior policy analyst for the Center for Public Policy Priorities, an Austin-based nonprofit think tank devoted to improving the economic and social conditions of low- and moderate-income Texans. She agreed that the card system eliminated fraud on the part of retailers, but said enrollment was declining before the card system went into effect and ""there weren't hordes and hordes of people fraudulently receiving food stamps.""

And two officials at the Texas Health and Human Services Commission insisted that GTECH, Block and his company have had no direct role in fraud detection.

""There is no fraud detection mechanism in the product GTECH delivered,"" said Wool, the commission's spokesman. Instead, Wool said, the system simply sends data to Texas' Office of Inspector General, which developed its own fraud detection software.

Block responded by showing us two emails from Douglas B. Walker, of Austin, who was a system analyst for the Texas Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) system, retiring in 2007. The messages asked Block to look into some cases of suspected fraud.

So we asked Wool to put us in touch with someone higher. He arranged an interview with Michael Garbarino, director of policy and outreach affairs for the inspector general's office, who expressed surprise at the Walker emails, saying he had talked to others to confirm that making such checks was not an assigned function.

""None of these contracts, none of the vendors, nor any of the subcontractors ever had within the scope of the contract fraud detection responsibilities,"" he said. ""The automation that runs that data through algorithms to arrive at questionable transactions was entirely created by state staff and never was in the scope of any vendor contract.""

In the end, Block did help develop the EBT system and the system likely saved -- directly or indirectly -- more than $1 billion in waste and fraud since its implementation 15 years ago. We rate his claim as True.

The candidate, in interviews and on his blog, insists that he played a key role in fraud detection. He maintains that he continues helping with that task today. But Block is now aware, through our contacts with his office, that two Texas officials consistently and adamantly dispute that.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8C0E40>],/factchecks/2010/aug/29/kenneth-block/block-says-system-he-helped-create-detect-welfare-/

Back to Basics PAC says Gov. Rick Perry has overseen the highest unemployment in Texas in 22 years
","
In a full-page ad that ran Tuesday in newspapers across Texas, including the Austin American-Statesman, a political action group asks voters to ""tell Rick Perry to stop cowering and face Texans like a man."" 
It's the latest salvo in the crossfire over which gubernatorial candidate is afraid to debate: Democrat Bill White or GOP incumbent Rick Perry, who says he's waiting for White to release more of his income tax returns. 
The ad, paid for by Back to Basics, a pro-White PAC, claims Perry is scared to ""defend his miserable record."" Among its charges: Perry, who's been governor for 10 years, ""has overseen the highest Texas unemployment in 22 years."" 
That's practically a whole generation. Is it true? 
After contacting Back to Basics, we learned that its researchers had looked at annual unemployment data for Texas from the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics and compared those rates with the average thus far for 2010, which is 8.3 percent. The last time the annual rate was higher was 1987 — 23 years ago -- when it was 8.5 percent. 
Following the advice of Cheryl Abbot, an economist for the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics in Dallas, we examined monthly statewide unemployment rates that have been seasonally adjusted, which accounts for temporary employment surges (such as during the Christmas holidays). 
The state's all-time low is 4.2 percent, which it hit most recently in January 2001, shortly after Perry took office. The all-time high: 9.3 percent, in November 1986. During Perry's tenure, the highest monthly unemployment rate has been 8.3 percent, in April and May of 2010. 
The last time the unemployment rate was greater? July 1987, when it was 8.4 percent (Republican Bill Clements was re-elected as Texas' governor later that year.) So, considering unemployment on a monthly basis, the jobless rate in April 2010 was the highest it's been since July 1987, 22 years and nine months earlier. 
But that hasn't stopped Perry from praising Texas' economic performance during his tenure. 
""We’re dealing with joblessness like everyone else is, but our unemployment rate is more than a full point below the national average thanks to the strength of our economy,"" the governor said in a speech prepared for delivery Aug. 12 in West Texas. Texas' seasonally adjusted unemployment rate in July was 8.2 percent, compared with the national rate of 9.5 percent. 
Responding to Back to Basics' statement that the governor ""has overseen the highest Texas unemployment in 22 years,"" Catherine Frazier, a spokeswoman for Perry's campaign, told us that ""we are one of the few states that continues creating jobs and attracting renowned companies to relocate and expand within our borders."" 
Asked to point to specific ways that Perry has contributed to the state's economic health, Frazier said the governor has ""led the charge to establish the Texas Enterprise Fund"" to encourage companies to expand in Texas. She also said Perry ""has worked with state leadership to uphold principles of low taxes, fiscal restraint and reasonable regulations, which are the reasons Texas is ahead of the pack economically compared to other states."" 
Still, we wondered how much credit — or blame — governors deserve for the employment situation in their states, and asked several experts that question. 
""The short answer: Their power is very limited,"" said Susan Hansen, a political science professor at the University of Pittsburgh. 
In a 1999 article in the journal Political Research Quarterly, Hansen argues that the Federal Reserve — with its power to affect interest rates — the president and Congress ""have far more influence over the nation's economy (and) unemployment ... than do the states in our federal system. State elected officials seem to be well aware of their vulnerability to economic downturns, and their policy efforts (symbolic though they may be) must be considered in this light."" 
Such ""symbolic"" efforts, wrote Hansen, run the gamut from economic-development programs to overseas trips to promote a state's business climate — all things Perry has done. 
Hansen also said state programs that use incentives to lure companies — like the Texas Enterprise Fund — are ""marginal at best"" in boosting employment. Paul Brace, a political science professor at Rice University in Houston, said that virtually every state offers such programs and that their actual benefits are exaggerated. 
The Texas Enterprise Fund has spent $397 million since 2003 on projects that have generated ""more than 53,600 new jobs,"" according to an Aug. 18 news release from the governor's office, which oversees that fund. 
To put that number in context, Texas had a net gain of about a million nonfarm jobs between 2003 and 2010, according to the Texas Workforce Commission. Jobs credited to the enterprise fund are about 5 percent of that total. 
More important, the experts agreed, were the state's strength in sectors where employment remains high, particularly natural resources and agriculture. Brace cited the state's housing markets, which avoided the worst pain of the subprime mortgage crisis, and the absence of a personal income tax in Texas. 
When asked what role the governor may have played in the Texas rise in unemployment, Abbot of the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that higher jobless rates are a national trend and ""you could only say that (Perry) had a part in it in the sense that all other 49 governors had a part"" in growing joblessness nationwide. 
Cliff Walker, director of the Back to Basics PAC, said that ""as CEO of the state, (Perry) certainly touts his success in creating a strong economic climate. If he takes credit for that, why shouldn't he also take the responsibility for ""the state's job losses?"" 
Perhaps because the first is politically advantageous while the second is not. Either way, the experts we talked to agreed that governors have little to do with statewide job losses or gains that take place on their watch. As Brace put it: ""Overall unemployment wasn't (Perry's) fault, but our relatively good performance also has little to do with what he did."" 
In other words, synchronous events don't necessarily add up to responsibility. We made the same point in our January ruling (Pants on Fire!) on a Republican Party claim that as mayor of Houston, White ""presided over"" construction of a Planned Parenthood ""abortion clinic."" We found White no more responsible for the privately funded clinic than he was for the weather or baseball playoffs during his tenure. 
In this case, Back to Basics' numbers stand up: The state's unemployment rate under Perry has hit a 22-year high. But the suggestion that the governor is to blame does not. 
We rate Back to Basics' statement as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC46980>],/factchecks/2010/aug/28/back-basics/back-basics-pac-says-gov-rick-perry-has-overseen-t/

Transit tax foe Sam Rashid says it's $300 million for rail in Tampa
","
On Nov. 2, voters will be asked to decide a number of ballot questions. One of the most important ones asks Hillsborough County voters if they support raising the sales tax by a penny to pay for a new commuter rail system, expanded bus service and road building. 
If the primary election was any indication, the transit tax question will color the debate in other political contests. One recurring assertion from tax opponents was that the proposed increase will cost taxpayers $300 million a year. 
It was often infused with the suggestion that all of that money will go toward rail and benefit only Tampa. We decided to test one such statement. 
It came in the context of Hillsborough County Commissioner Mark Sharpe’s successful re-election bid. Sharpe has been a leading advocate of the referendum. He had faced a challenge in the Republican primary from former county party leader Josh Burgin, who opposed the tax. 
Sam Rashid, a conservative activist and transit tax opponent, put out a mid-summer mailer that claimed Sharpe, a previously avowed opponent of new taxes, was seeking to ""impose"" a huge one. 
""Up to $300 million per year, in perpetuity, to finance a rail system for the City of Tampa,"" Rashid wrote. Burgin used the $300 million figure repeatedly in his own campaign material. 
We decided to look at whether $300 million, and the way Rashid couched its use, was accurate. 
We started with the number itself, asking Rashid where he got it. He told PolitiFact Florida that it was based on his recollection of what existing Hillsborough County sales taxes have produced at their peak, and that he simply tacked on a bit more to account for anticipated growth and inflation. 
The county has two sales taxes it assesses, both a half-cent charged on goods and some services. One pays for health care for the poor. The other funds such things as roads, jails and the construction of Raymond James Stadium. 
County records show that revenues from the two sales taxes peaked in 2006 at $107.1 million each. Double that figure to get what a full penny tax would have raised: $214.2 million – quite a bit shy of $300 million. 
Since then, sales tax revenues have dropped off considerably. Through the first 10 months of the current fiscal year, the tax was projected to bring in $64.8 million, making Rashid’s figure look like an even greater exaggeration. 
Rashid gives himself some cover by using the qualifier ""up to."" He says he was trying to project what the tax will cost annually over its lifetime, and his word choice in the mailer gives that sense. 
So we asked Kevin Brickey, the economist for Hillsborough County government, when sales tax receipts might reasonably be expected to reach $300 million. Brickey noted such predictions can be debated during stable economic times. The current recession makes it more of a dicey proposition. 
But Brickey prepared just such an analysis for the county’s transit agency, Hillsborough Area Regional Transit, in July. HART would oversee the rail and bus system if the referendum is approved. 
His analysis was based on a conservative annual growth rate assumption of 4 percent. It estimated that sales tax revenues from a full penny tax will not reach $300 million until fiscal year 2022 – more than a decade after the tax goes into effect. 
Brickey performed a second analysis for PolitiFact using a 6 percent growth rate, still considered conservative, but one forecasters might typically use under normal circumstances. It shows the $300 million threshold getting crossed in fiscal year 2019. 
Due to compounding, Brickey predicts that even under a growth scenario of approximately 4 percent, the sales tax would approach $600 million by its 30th year. So under reasonably conservative projections, Rashid’s number is certainly in the ballpark, and arguably understates the long-term cost to taxpayers. 
But there are problems with Rashid’s assertion because he contends that all the money will go toward rail in Tampa. For one, 25 percent of sales tax revenues would be obligated toward road work. 
That means that by the second year of the tax, when Brickey estimates it should bring in nearly $200 million, $50 million will go toward road projects that have nothing to do with rail. They are spread throughout the county and are concentrated outside of Tampa by design, particularly in early years. 
Figuring out how much of the rest will go toward rail, as opposed to buses, presents a greater challenge. Estimates vary from year to year as construction of the rail system progresses and trains start rolling. 
HART has prepared an analysis of where all the money will go over the next 30 years. But it combines sales tax revenues and money local officials hope to get from the state and federal government in matching dollars, plus property tax revenues, in one pot. 
Based on those numbers, HART expects to spend about 52 percent of all of its future revenue on rail. 
Working with Brickey and HART, the Hillsborough County Metropolitan Planning Organization has prepared a detailed analysis of how the sales tax would be spent through 2035. It shows that, of the 75 percent of the penny tax that would be spent on transit, 57 percent would go toward rail. 
That represents 43 percent of all projected sales tax expenditures. Even adding in a significant ""oops"" factor, about half the money would go toward rail. The rest would go toward buses, roads and trails, much if not most of it outside Tampa city limits. 
These numbers are subject to change. HART is still doing an analysis to determine if rail makes sense along the corridors identified for it. And they’re still determining what specific paths the rail lines would take, which they won’t finish until after the election. That all affects the bottom line. 
Finally, while it is true that the first two legs of the train system would be within Tampa city limits, there are plans for later expansion outside the city, including a line to Brandon. 
If Rashid had confined his statement to asserting that the proposed hike would cost taxpayers $300 million a year, we probably would have rated that Mostly True, since it will be soon enough. 
But he said that it was all going for trains in the city of Tampa. 
It is true that this whole exercise was largely initiated by Tampa Mayor Pam Iorio, who made building a commuter rail system a top goal. But the discussion ended up in the hands of the County Commission, which ultimately put the question on the ballot. 
After months of study initiated by Commission Chairman Ken Hagan, a task force recommended that a significant portion of the money go to roads and buses. And that’s the position the County Commission took in crafting the ballot language. 
So while critics want to label the initiative a rail tax for the city of Tampa that will not benefit suburban residents, PolitiFact finds Rashid’s attempt to frame the issue as Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEC0F80>],/factchecks/2010/aug/28/sam-rashid/hillsborough-county-sales-tax/

Glenn Beck claims government is trying to close Lincoln Memorial to large gatherings
","While hyping his upcoming ""Restoring Honor"" rally at the Lincoln Memorial, Glenn Beck ominously warned during his June 28, 2010, radio program this may be the last chance to attend a large rally at the historic Lincoln Memorial.

""The government is trying to now close the Lincoln Memorial for any kind of large gatherings,"" Beck said. ""This may be the last large gathering ever to assemble at the Lincoln Memorial. Historic, historic.""

The comment came in the context of Beck challenging critics -- ""enemies have come out from the woodwork"" -- who criticized Beck's decision to hold the rally on Aug. 28, the anniversary of Martin Luther King Jr.'s ""I Have a Dream"" speech, which King delivered from the same steps on which Beck plans to speak.

""They (critics) have gone on to say that this is a slap in the face of Abraham Lincoln,"" Beck said. ""Okay. So, I don't have a right -- I don't have a right to speak my mind and this -- I told you, the reason why 8-28 is -- one reason why it's historic is because it may be the last time anyone is allowed to hold a rally at 8-28, and they will -- they will couch that in, it's too sacred of a spot.""

In an Aug. 25, 2010, story, Los Angeles Times reporter Kathleen Hennessey quoted a National Park Service spokesman calling Beck's claim baseless and wrong.

We contacted Beck's publicist for clarification of, and backup for, Beck's claim about government efforts to close the Lincoln Memorial for any kind of large gatherings, but got no response.

So we, too, contacted the National Park Service and got this unequivocal statement via e-mail:

""There is absolutely no attempt by the government to restrict gatherings at the Lincoln Memorial or at any of our sites,"" said Margie Ortiz, a National Park Service spokeswoman. ""There is zero basis for his claim.""

The National Park Service issues about 3,000 permits a year for Lafayette Park, the White House sidewalks, as well as other park sites in the Capital area, including the Lincoln Memorial. About 60 percent of them are for ""First Amendment Activity,"" Ortiz said.

Major rehabilitation work on the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool and grounds will begin next month, and could continue for two years, but National Park Service officials said that work will not prevent the use of the facilities for gatherings, though the size of a gathering would be considered when weighing applications during the construction period. So far, though, that has not been an issue.

""The Lincoln Memorial stands as a symbol of freedom,"" Ortiz said. ""The Memorial is an American icon that attracts millions of visitors a year who seek inspiration and hope. Why would the National Park Service close the Lincoln for any kind of large gathering? Wouldn't this be contradictory to everything the Memorial stands for?""

Those wishing to hold an event at the Lincoln Memorial need to obtain a permit, and there are some rules, regulations and fees spelled out on the permit website.

Some national events -- such as the Lighting of the National Christmas Tree in the northern half of the Ellipse -- carry priority status, but otherwise, applications for demonstrations and special events are done ""in order of receipt ... on a first-come, first-serve basis,"" Ortiz said. ""We remain content neutral to whatever 'message' the permit applicant brings with them.""

To review, Beck warned ""the government is trying to now close the Lincoln Memorial for any kind of large gatherings"" and that his rally ""may be the last large gathering ever to assemble at the Lincoln Memorial."" It is possible that gatherings as large as Beck's event may be limited during renovation of the Lincoln Memorial reflecting pool and grounds -- though no applications have been denied to date. But Beck suggests the government is trying to silence political speech by blocking future rallies, and there's absolutely no evidence of that. We rule Beck's statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6994C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/27/glenn-beck/glenn-back-claims-government-is-trying-to-close-Li/

Obama says Republicans oppose strengthening the child care tax credit
","
  
Democrats want to make it easier for working parents to pay for child care, but congressional Republicans don't think that's a good idea, President Barack Obama told his audience in Columbus, Ohio, on Aug. 18, 2010.

Asked whether the government has done anything to reduce child care costs, Obama said, ""We have a child care credit in place. We’d like to make it stronger. This is one of those back-and-forths we’ve been having with the Republicans, because we actually think it is a good idea and they don’t. But I think that giving families support who have to work each and every day is absolutely critical.""

Are Republican lawmakers really opposed to increasing the child care credit? We decided to look into it.

First, a little background. The Child and Dependent Care Credit allows parents who work or go to school to deduct between 20 and 35 percent of child care expenses for children under age 13. The credit, for expenses that total up to $3,000, can help reduce one's income tax liability to zero, but it is non-refundable. As a result, low-income families who owe little or no income tax to begin with get little benefit from the credit, according to the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution.

Congress enacted the credit in 1976 and in 1981 implemented a sliding scale that made the credit more progressive. More changes came in 1988 and 2001, when Congress increased the maximum allowable expenses. The latest extension, however, is scheduled to expire at the end of this year and unless Congress takes action, the maximum allowable expenses will drop to $2,400 for one child and $4,800 for two.

President Obama was right when he said that Democrats have been working to make the credit ""stronger."" He called for doubling the credit in his January State of the Union address and later made a proposal to make permanent the maximum 35 percent rate and the $3,000 maximum for expenses. His proposal would also permanently increase to $85,000 the income level when the credit begins to phase out, according to a Tax Policy Center analysis. Democrats in Congress have seemed receptive. Rep. Allyson Schwartz, D-Penn., introduced a bill in May that would make the 35 percent rate permanent. The bill has 11 co-sponsors, all Democrats.

But as for the Republicans, we found very limited evidence to substantiate Obama's claim that they are against it.

On Jan. 25, 2010, the White House Middle Class Task Force released a set of policy proposals designed to help middle-class families. The first proposal on the list called for doubling the Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit for families making under $85,000 a year.

The proposals prompted general criticism from Republicans, who claimed the proposals would not provide much of a boost to the economy.

Rep. John Boehner, the House Republican leader, said in a press release that none of the proposals ""outlined by the White House today would, in fact, create jobs. And they do nothing to protect Americans from the president’s job-killing agenda."" Striking a similar tone, Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich. told Bloomberg News that ""what will help middle-class families most is creating jobs and reducing the unemployment rate, but these proposals won’t do either.""

Clearly those Republicans are not supporting the proposal that includes the child-care tax credit, but they are not singling it out for opposition, either.

We found a report issued by the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, which argued that ""increasing this credit would do nothing to encourage growth."" The credit as it stands discriminates against families who choose alternative child care arrangements, and Congress should focus on cutting marginal tax rates, the report states.

Still, we weren't able to find any Republican lawmakers who cited the report in their speeches or statements, and we find it's a stretch for Democrats such as Obama to claim that the Republican criticism means they specifically oppose child care tax credits.

In fact, Republicans have often supported the credits in the past. GOP members in both the House and the Senate overwhelmingly backed previous bills that included the child care credit.

Three Republicans have co-sponsored a tax bill by Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., that would make the tax credit permanent. And a 2009 amendment that would improve the child care credit authored by Sen. Barbara Boxer, D-Calif., passed by unanimous consent, which means no Republican objected.

Likewise, Sen. Charles Grassley, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has called for changes to ensure that small companies can take advantage of the child care credit.

Obama said that Republicans ""don't think it's a good idea"" to make the child care tax credit ""stronger."" It is true that the top Republican in the House dismissed the report of the White House Middle Class task force that proposed to double the credit, but the Obama administration has not produced any evidence of specific GOP opposition and we find plenty of other examples where Republicans have supported beefing up the credits. We find his claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8DC2C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/27/barack-obama/obama-says-republicans-oppose-strengthening-child-/

Loranne Ausley attacks Jeff Atwater's banking ties in a new web ad
","
A web ad by the Democratic nominee for chief financial officer has her Republican opponent crying foul. 
Loranne Ausley is trying to tie state Senate President Jeff Atwater to a Florida bank that was shut down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation in April 2010. 
The ad, called ""Can Florida Afford Jeff Atwater?,"" opens with a picture of Atwater inside an elaborate frame, like it's a painted portrait. 
""Jeff Atwater wants to be Florida's next chief financial officer. But here is what he doesn't want you to know,"" a narrator says, as the video first cuts to an image of a safe, then a second image of Atwater and a bank. 
""Jeff Atwater was an executive vice president at Riverside National Bank, which was rated one of the seven weakest banks in all of Florida. In fact, Atwater's bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. But not before Atwater's bank cost the FDIC $491 million dollars."" 
Then the video cuts back to the image of the safe, then the Atwater portrait. 
""So ask yourself, can Florida really afford Jeff Atwater as our next CFO?"" 
The ad produced this reaction from Atwater's campaign: 
""In another sign that her stagnant campaign is completely devoid of a positive vision for Florida, liberal Loranne Ausley has launched a mudslinging attack on the web that lies about Jeff Atwater's professional experience,"" Atwater spokesman Brian Hughes said. 
Lies? In a political campaign? Could it be? 
PolitiFact Florida wanted to get to the bottom of this. 
For the purpose of this fact-check, we're focusing on this statement: ""Atwater's bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation."" 
First, let's establish Atwater's role and time at Riverside.

Atwater's background at Riverside

Atwater, of North Palm Beach, oversaw business development at Riverside Bank's Palm Beach County branches from 2002 to February 2009. When he left the bank, it had more than 60 branches and more than 1,000 employees in Florida. 
Atwater told PolitiFact Florida he left the bank to focus on his responsibilities as Senate President. 
In newspaper articles, Atwater had been listed as Palm Beach County president of Riverside National Bank. 
But a bank spokeswoman told the Palm Beach Post that Atwater functioned as a ""regional business development manager"" at the bank's Palm Beach County branches. Atwater's 2008 pay from Riverside was $199,833 and he listed his title as ""EVP"" on his 2009 financial disclosure statement. 
Atwater spokesman Hughes says that stands for executive vice president. 
""The reality is it's a local community bank, one in which his title was vice president,"" Hughes said. ""But his day-to-day responsibility was almost that of a regional branch manger. He worked with a few local branches."" 
So Atwater was definitely a manager at the bank, and likely one of its higher-paid executives. He was not a member of the board of directors, however, and maintains he had no direct say in the bank's loan-making process. 
Bank finds itself in trouble

On May 27, 2009 -- about three months after Atwater left Riverside -- the bank was one of seven in Florida that failed to hold the amount of money required by regulators, according to the St. Petersburg Times.

And the Palm Beach Post reported on May 29 that Riverside was ranked among the weakest in the nation, according to TheStreet.com. 
Fast forward to April 16, 2010, almost a year later. 
The FDIC announced that it was closing Riverside National Bank and that TD Bank was taking over its accounts. Riverside, and two other Florida banks, were closed in order ""to protect depositors,"" according to the FDIC. 
In its announcement, the FDIC said the cost to the FDIC's insurance fund to guarantee the bank's obligations was $491.8 million. 
The Post documented the bank's closure this way: 
FORT PIERCE — Beset by steep losses and unable to raise much-needed capital, Riverside National Bank was closed by federal regulators Friday. 
Its business was taken over by TD Bank, the U.S. arm of Toronto-Dominion Bank. The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. said Riverside's failure is expected to cost the FDIC’s Deposit Insurance Fund $492 million. 
Riverside, a stalwart of St. Lucie County’s business community, was the second-largest of the 25 Florida banks shuttered by the FDIC since August 2008. 
Riverside had 58 offices from Palm Beach County to Volusia County. Its $3.4 billion in assets made it the seventh-­largest bank headquartered in Florida. 
Riverside posted huge losses in the past two years, including red ink of $138.9 million in 2008 and $131 million in 2009. 
""This was a dead bank walking,"" said Miami banking analyst Ken Thomas. ""The question is why has the FDIC let them flail away for so long."" 
The article noted that Riverside was hit hard by the collapse of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, rendering Riverside's securities in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac worthless. Loan losses escalated. Atwater isn't mentioned in the story. 
Back to the ad 
Ausley's ad makes three basic claims. 
First, that Atwater worked as an executive at Riverside National Bank. That's true. 
Second, that the bank was rated one of the weakest in Florida. That's true. 
And third, that Riverside eventually was shut down by federal regulators. Also true. 
But the problem is the 30-second spot splices together those three events like they happened within weeks of each other, when really they were separated by 14 months. 
Why is that important to know? Because Atwater was no longer working at Riverside when the bank was either rated weak, or shut down. That alone doesn't mean Atwater can't be culpable. And we imagine he had to at least be aware of the bank's financial problems, considering it posted a $138.9 million loss in 2008. But the ad's references to ""Atwater's bank"" are misleading, because it's more accurately described as ""Atwater's former bank."" 
Naturally, the question of culpability is harder to determine -- and one we're not ruling on. 
We can, however, rule on the specific claim in Ausley's ad. She said, ""Atwater's bank was so weak that just a few months ago it was shut down by the FDIC."" 
At the time, it wasn't Atwater's bank. It may have been his former bank, or best yet, it was a bank where he used to work as an executive vice president. For the misleading timeline, we find the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7A66C0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/27/loranne-ausley/loranne-ausley-attacks-jeff-atwaters-banking-ties-/

AFSCME ad calls Ohio congressional candidate Jim Renacci a tax cheat
","
With control of the U.S. House at stake, Republicans and Democrats are waging fierce election campaigns across the country. In Ohio, at least four seats are considered in play, including the 16th Congressional District seat held by freshman Democratic Rep. John Boccieri of Alliance, a former state legislator who faces a well-financed Republican challenge from businessman Jim Renacci, a former Wadsworth mayor.

The American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees union has joined the fight, attacking Renacci in two television advertisements. We recently looked into a statement in the first ad, which accused Renacci of backing a massive tax increase, and found it to be Half True.

The second ad levels an even harsher accusation that Renacci ""cheated on his income taxes"" and labels him a ""deadbeat citizen.""

Renacci has filed a defamation lawsuit in Stark County Common Pleas Court over the ad, which says he ""hid"" more than $13 million, and was forced to pay $1.4 million in back taxes and penalties. We wanted to see if AFSCME got closer to the truth the second time around.

The basis of the attack is a dispute between Renacci and the Ohio Department of Taxation. Renacci has built a fortune from business interests that include nursing homes, real estate investments, auto and motorcycle dealerships, a bar and grill, an arena football team and a minor-league baseball team.

The tax department assessed Renacci about $1.4 million in back taxes, interest and penalties for misreporting his income in 2000. Renacci and his wife, Tina, filed a state tax return for that year that claimed they had a loss of $247,336, but an audit found they actually made $13,730,440. The couple filed a tax appeal when the state dinged them for $954,650 in back taxes, $146,938 in interest and $293,876 in penalties.

At issue was Renacci’s trust income from an ""S"" corporation that had not been subject to state taxes for several years before Ohio’s tax commissioner issued an ""information release"" in January 2000 that changed the state’s policy and directed taxpayers to add such trust income to their federal adjusted gross income. ""S"" corporations permit income to be taxed at an individual rate for federal tax purposes and avoid double taxation on corporate income.

The tax department followed up with another information release in 2002 warning that it was launching audits and would impose fraud penalties on taxpayers who did not file amended returns reflecting the trust income and pay the taxes due.

Renacci was among a group of taxpayers who fought the state decision. He contended that the trust income should have been tax-free and that he had ""reasonable cause"" to exclude it on his tax return, according to tax department and court documents.

Others dropped their appeals, but Renacci continued to fight, despite an Ohio Supreme Court ruling in 2006 in a similar case in which the court said the trust income was subject to taxation. In that case, the taxpayers reported their S corporation income on their 2000 tax return and then unsuccessfully asked for a refund.

Court records show the Renaccis eventually settled the tax dispute and sent the state the full amount due.

""He was proud of his fight, and to have fought till the end, along with many other Ohioans for tax fairness,"" Renacci’s campaign spokesman Jim Slepian said in an interview for a Plain Dealer story in April.

The AFSCME ad cites as its source an Associated Press story from April that said Renacci ""fought vigorously but eventually paid"" the back taxes and other assessments.

Webster’s New World Dictionary defines cheat as ""a person who defrauds, deceives, or tricks others; swindler."" And it defines deadbeat as ""a person who tries to evade paying debts.""

It seems legitimate to raise questions about Renacci’s failure to properly report his income. Some facts are not in dispute.
  

  

  


But in the end, after taking his dispute to court and working within the system to resolve it, he did ultimately pay the state the full amount due and he wasn’t ever charged with tax fraud.

We rate AFSCME’s statement as Mostly True.

Congressman sides with ""sexual deviants"" with no vote, opponent says
","
Does a Georgia congressman approve of the sale of sexually deviant videos?

Democrat Russell Edwards leveled the attack on his website against U.S. Rep. Paul Broun, a Republican from Athens and his opponent in the Nov. 2 election. Edwards' claim is based on Broun's vote against a resolution to prohibit the sale of ""crush videos."" The videos typically show women wearing high heels stomping on kittens, rabbits or rodents. For some, it is a sexual fetish. To most, it's animal cruelty.

""Paul Broun Jr. sides with sexual deviants to support sale of 'crush videos,' "" Edwards said.

The resolution passed 416-3. Broun, a former physician, voted against the resolution, along with Reps. Tom Graves, R-Ga., and Ron Paul, R-Texas. 

The accusation is an eye-opener, so we decided to check it out. Is Edwards right about the congressman?

No, said Broun, who called the videos ""morally reprehensible.""
  

Bob Barr a former congressman and U.S. attorney from Georgia, agreed that federal officials have advantages over state officials in investigating and prosecuting ""crush video"" type cases. He cited the investigative tools of the FBI and statutes to prosecute mail and wire fraud, which carry longer prison sentences.

Still, Barr is not a supporter of HR 5566 and cited many of the same reasons cited by Broun. Barr, then a Republican House member, voted against the 1999 law. And Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito noted in his dissent to the April ruling that ""the videos record the commission of violent criminal acts,"" alluding to state animal cruelty laws.

To say a congressman sides with ""sexual deviants"" is a hefty claim. Broun did vote against the resolution, but he articulated reasons that fall well within his political ideals and record. Whether those reasons trump pragmatic concerns about how best to crack down on distribution of the videos is another question. We had a problem with Edwards saying that Broun ""supports"" the sale of the videos, particularly since Broun condemned them. Voting against the resolution on constitutional grounds is not the same as supporting the sale of deviant material. We rate Edwards' statement about Broun's vote on HR 5566 as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBAD5AC0>],/factchecks/2010/aug/27/russell-edwards/congressman-sides-sexual-deviants-no-vote-opponent/

Obama a Muslim? No he's not. The evidence has not changed.
","
President Barack Obama is a Christian, but a minority of the American public keeps telling pollsters he's a Muslim.

The Pew Research Center recently reported that 18 percent of Americans believe Obama is a Muslim, up from 11 percent in March 2009. A Time magazine poll found even more -- 24 percent -- said he was a Muslim.

PolitiFact has done extensive fact-checking on Obama's faith and has debunked false claims in chain e-mails that he attended a radical Islamic school, that his political rise mirrored a biblical tale about the Antichrist, and that he took the oath for U.S. Senate on a Koran. All three earned our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.

Our fact-checking also showed clear evidence that Obama is a Christian. According to the president's memoirs and independent biographies, Obama was not raised in any particular faith. He became a Christian when he was in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. Obama said the churches there impressed him with their commitment to social justice and the hope they gave to the poor.

""It was because of these newfound understandings that I was finally able to walk down the aisle of Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street in the Southside of Chicago one day and affirm my Christian faith,"" Obama said in a 2006 speech. ""It came about as a choice, and not an epiphany. I didn't fall out in church. The questions I had didn't magically disappear. But kneeling beneath that cross on the South Side, I felt that I heard God's spirit beckoning me. I submitted myself to His will, and dedicated myself to discovering His truth.""

The pastor of Trinity then was Jeremiah Wright, the minister from whom Obama distanced himself in the 2008 presidential campaign, after video of some of Wright's more controversial sermons were aired on television and the Internet. The break between the two men was over Wright's comments about American foreign policy and race relations, not tenets of Christian doctrine.

Several independent reports have documented Obama's church membership and faith life. ""Along his Senate campaign trail (in 2004), Obama would never fail to carry his Christian Bible. He would place it right beside him, in the small compartment in the passenger side door of the SUV, so he could refer to it often,"" reported journalist David Mendell in his 2007 biography Obama: From Promise to Power.

After the falling out with Wright, Obama said he intended find a new church once the campaign was over. In office, though, Obama has not attended one church regularly. Instead, he has worshipped at various churches in the Washington, D.C., area, including the Allen Chapel African Methodist Episcopal Church, the Nineteenth Street Baptist Church, and St. John's Episcopal Church. He also has attended services at Camp David, the presidential retreat.

Obama regularly seeks spiritual guidance from a group of pastors and called them recently from Air Force One for a prayer session, according to an account in the Washington Post. Last week, when the Pew poll was released, presidential aides said Obama remains a practicing Christian and prays daily.

In April this year, Obama hosted an Easter prayer breakfast at the White House, and spoke of being inspired by Christ's resurrection, particularly in light of the human failings of selfishness and pride.

""It's not easy to purge these afflictions, to achieve redemption,"" Obama said. ""But as Christians, we believe that redemption can be delivered -- by faith in Jesus Christ. And the possibility of redemption can make straight the crookedness of a character; make whole the incompleteness of a soul. Redemption makes life, however fleeting here on Earth, resound with eternal hope.""

So why do so many people keep saying he's Muslim? A benign explanation is that there is genuine confusion about his religion because Obama has Muslim ancestors on his father's side and a traditionally Muslim middle name, Hussein. Another is that people who disagree with him politically and dislike the Muslim religion like to associate him with something they perceive to be negative. (Read more about these perceptions in our report, ""Why do so many people think Obama is a Muslim?"")

But all evidence points to the fact that Obama is a Christian. The members of the public who say he is a Muslim -- 18 percent, according to the Pew poll -- are wrong, and we rate their statement Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB8B0400>],/factchecks/2010/aug/26/18-percent-american-public/obama-muslim-no-hes-not-evidence-has-not-changed/
"['National', 'Religion', 'Franklin Graham']","
Graham said the ""seed of Islam"" passes through the father to Obama. We found widespread disagreement.
","
President Barack Obama has declared himself a Christian. He has worshipped in Christian churches, prayed with Christian ministers, and recounted how he knelt beneath a cross and felt God's spirit.

And yet, a surprising number of Americans keep telling pollsters they believe he's a Muslim.

The Pew Research Center last week reported that 18 percent of Americans believe Obama is a Muslim, up from 11 percent in March 2009. A Time magazine poll also released last week found even more -- 24 percent - said he was a Muslim. (Read our longer report on this issue.)

The evangelical minister Franklin Graham said on CNN that it's because of Obama's background.

""He was born a Muslim. His father was a Muslim; the seed of Muslim is passed through the father like the seed of Judaism is passed through the mother. He was born a Muslim; his father gave him an Islamic name,"" Graham said, adding later in the interview, ""you can be born a Muslim. You can be born a Jew. But you can't be born a Christian.""

Graham added, however, that he did consider Obama to be a Christian today: ""Now, it's obvious that the president has renounced the Prophet Mohammed and he has renounced Islam and he has accepted Jesus Christ. That's what he says he has done. I cannot say that he hasn't. So I just have to believe the president is what he has said.""

We wanted to check Graham's statement that ""the seed of Muslim is passed through the father.""

But first, we should note Graham is right that Obama has Muslim ancestors. According to family accounts, Obama's paternal grandfather Onyango Obama was a Muslim. But it's not clear that his biological father, Barack Hussein Obama Sr., ever practiced the religion. By all accounts, Obama's Kenyan father was an atheist more interested in economics and government than religion. And the senior Obama had little influence on the future president because he left his American wife, Ann Dunham, shortly after Obama's birth in 1961.

Dunham married again, to Lolo Soetero, an Indonesian man who was Muslim, and the family moved to Indonesia when Obama was 6 years old, where he attended a Muslim public school and a Catholic school at different times. But Soetero was not particularly devout, according to his daughter and Obama's half-sister, Maya Soetero-Ng. She told biographer David Remnick that Soetero ""never went to prayer services except for big communal events.""

Obama described his religious upbringing this way: ""My father, who returned to Kenya when I was just two, was born Muslim but as an adult became an atheist. My mother, whose parents were non-practicing Baptists and Methodists, was probably one of the most spiritual and kindest people I've ever known, but grew up with a healthy skepticism of organized religion herself. As a consequence, so did I.""

But when we looked into Graham's statement that ""the seed of Muslim is passed through the father like the seed of Judaism is passed through the mother,"" we found a good bit of evidence to the contrary.

We consulted several reference books on the Islamic religion, interviewed academic experts and consulted with Islamic groups. None of the sources we checked endorsed Graham's view as completely accurate.

It's true that in Muslim cultures, the children of Muslims are generally assumed to be Muslim themselves, according to our research. But all of the sources we looked at described the Islamic faith as not belonging to any particular race, ethnicity or nation. Most of the sources said that whether one truly is a Muslim or not depends on the belief in Muslim teaching and the following of its practices, not whether one is born into the faith.

Blain Auer, an assistant professor of Islamic studies at Western Michigan University, said the most prominent requirement is for believers to recite the shahadah, a statement of faith that affirms ""I witness that there is no god but God and Mohammed is his Messenger.""

""Franklin Graham's statement is incorrect. Islam is an act of faith, not a genetic disposition,"" Auer said via e-mail.

Representatives of Muslim groups in the United States also said Graham's description was inaccurate. ""It's not something one inherits automatically or biologically. What is important is the self-identification, (regardless of the) background they may have been born into,"" said Sayyid M. Syeed, national director of the Islamic Society of North America.

Another professor of Islamic studies, Frederick Colby, agreed that people are generally considered Muslim if they affirm that by reciting the shahadah. But it can get complicated, he added.

""Defining religious membership is notoriously difficult,"" Colby said via e-mail. ""Does it involve merely what the person believes? Is it what they do (e.g. ritual and practice)? Is it being a member of a particular organization? Many contemporary scholars of religion think that each of these elements plays a role in defining 'religion.'""

Indeed, the reference book Islam: A Very Short Introduction, partly supported Graham's contention but it discusses just such complications. It states that the primary definition of a Muslim is someone who surrenders himself or herself to the will of God.

""'Islam' in Arabic is a verbal noun, meaning self-surrender to God as revealed through the message and life of his Prophet, Mohammed,"" writes author Malise Ruthven. A secondary definition is ""one born to a Muslim father who takes on his or her parent's confessional identity without necessarily subscribing to the beliefs and practices of the faith, just as a Jew may define him- or herself as 'Jewish' without observing the Halacha."" (The Halacha is Jewish religious law.)

But this secondary definition ""is very far from being uncontested,"" Ruthven writes, adding, ""Generally there is little consistency in the way such labels are applied.""

And even this definition is problematic since President Obama's father did not identify as a Muslim when Obama was born, said Ken Garden, a professor of religion at Tufts University who studies Islam. ""If Obama's father became an atheist, then he would not have been a Muslim at the time of Obama's birth, so Obama would not have been, even technically, a Muslim,"" said Garden.

Garden added that he was troubled that people would consider being a Muslim to be slanderous. ""I think that for Graham to muse aloud about him maybe being a Muslim or not throws gasoline on that fire,"" he said.

To be clear, we're fact-checking what Graham said, not whether any religion is any better or worse than another. In looking at most of the scholarly and objective descriptions of the Islamic faith, we found little to support Graham's statement that ""the seed of Muslim is passed through the father,"" absent belief in the tenets of the religion. In fact, the vast majority of sources said that religious faith was based on the affirmation of Islamic beliefs.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg argues against ""no-mosque zone""; says there's already a mosque four blocks from Ground Zero
","
In the debate over the inaccurately named ""Ground Zero Mosque,"" New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been one of the strongest and most consistent political voices in favor of it. 
In what the AP described as an ""impassioned speech"" at an event on Aug. 24, 2010, marking the Islamic holy month of Ramadan, Bloomberg said not allowing the proposal for a mosque two blocks from Ground Zero would be ""compromising our commitment to fighting terror with freedom."" 
And Bloomberg dismissed those who have called for a compromise solution, moving it to another location. 
""The question will then become how big should the no-mosque zone around the World Trade Center be,"" Bloomberg said. ""There is already a mosque four blocks away. Should it, too, be moved?"" 
With all the hand-wringing over the proposal for an Islamic cultural center with a mosque just two blocks away from Ground Zero, we wondered whether Bloomberg was right that there is already a mosque just four blocks away from the World Trade Center site. 
In short, yes. 
The mosque Bloomberg is referring to is Masjid Manhattan, which is located in the basement floor of a building at 20 Warren Street. And it's four blocks from the World Trade Center. 
Masjid Manhattan has been a fixture of the Lower Manhattan neighborhood since 1970. According to its website, hundreds gather there daily for five ""Congregational Salahs"" and more than 1,000 regularly attend Congregational Friday Sermons. 
The home page of the mosque's website currently carries the following ""disclaimer"": 
""Please be advised that we are by no means affiliated with any other organization trying to build anything new in the area of downtown Manhattan. 
""Since 1970, Masjid Manhattan has been a peaceful, not-for-profit organization located in the area of downtown Manhattan. Our members are City, State and Federal employees, as well as professional employees of the Financial area who come to our Masjid to perform their daily prayers. 
""Masjid Manhattan and its members condemn any type of terrorist acts. In particular, the attacks of 9/11 where non-Muslims as well as Muslims lost their lives. Islam always invites for peace; therefore Islam is not responsible for the actions of some ill individuals who, independently from what Islam advocates, have hatred against humanity. As Muslims and as Americans, we will never forget the beloved ones who perished that terrible day of September 11, 2001."" 
For some perspective on the relative distances between Ground Zero, the proposed mosque and the existing Masjid Manhattan, we direct you to the Washington Post's interactive online map showing the location of all three sites. 
There's also a mosque 12 blocks from Ground Zero, Masjid al-Farah, where Imam Feisal Abdul Rauf has been a longtime prayer leader. Rauf is one of the principals behind the plan for the cultural center and mosque proposal at 45-51 and 49-51 Park Place, two blocks north of the northern edge of the World Trade Center site. 
While Masjid Manhattan is conservative and Masjid al-Farah more progressive, a New York Times profile of the two mosques notes that both are essentially one-room operations. And they share another similarity, the story notes: both ""routinely turn people away for lack of space."" In fact, due to the spillover from Masjid al-Farah, Rauf has been leading prayer services since 2009 in one of the buildings at the heart of the controversy. 
Plans for the new property are much more ambitious than the settings of the existing mosques, calling for a $100 million, 15-story community center with a swimming pool, gym and basketball court, a 500-seat auditorium, a restaurant and culinary school, exhibitions, education programs, a library, reading room, art studios, childcare services and a September 11 memorial. The plans also include a mosque that the site's organizers estimated could attract as many as 2,000 worshippers on Fridays, according to the Washington Post. 
Again, in making his argument against a ""no-mosque zone around the World Trade Center,"" Bloomberg said there's already a mosque four blocks away from Ground Zero. He's right. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8A4380>],/factchecks/2010/aug/26/michael-bloomberg/mayor-michael-bloomberg-argues-against-no-mosque-z/

Dewhurst, suggesting Obama's impeachment, airs ridiculous claim about White House fielding live video of Benghazi attacks as they occurred
","David Dewhurst told a group that President Barack Obama ought to be impeached, saying later that his reasons include Obama standing by while the White House fielded live video of the fatal Benghazi attacks, the Texas Observer reported. Dewhurst, the third-term lieutenant governor faced with three challengers for the 2014 Republican nomination, suggested Obama’s impeachment while speaking Oct. 14, 2013, to the Northeast Tarrant County Tea Party, which also heard from the other GOP candidates. ""This election is about protecting you and your freedoms, which are given to you by God, but which are being trampled on by Barack Obama right now. I don’t know about you, but Barack Obama ought to be impeached,"" Dewhurst said, according to the Observer. ""Not only for trampling on our liberties, but what he did in Benghazi is just a crime."" Afterward, Dewhurst elaborated on his criticism of the administration’s handling of the September 2012 attack in Benghazi, which killed Americans including the U.S. ambassador to Libya, Chris Stephens. ""I’m very concerned about Benghazi, in which all of the national news reporting indicated that live video was streaming into the White House,"" Dewhurst told Observer reporter Christopher Hooks. ""That means that there was an overhead platform, probably a drone in the area. At least that’s what it tells me,"" he said. ""And for not mobilizing some response to protect the ambassador and those three Americans is just outrageous to me. Just outrageous."" We asked Dewhurst for the basis of his reference to a live video feed of the attacks reaching the White House and didn’t hear back. It didn’t take us long to find that the ""Benghazi live stream"" claim has already been debunked by the Snopes.com ""urban legends"" website. That Snopes post, last updated Nov. 1, 2012, traces the claim to an Oct. 24, 2012, Forbes magazine op-ed article, which opened: ""Just one hour after the seven-hour-long terrorist attacks upon the U.S. consulate in Benghazi began, our commander-in-chief, vice president, secretary of defense and their national security team gathered together in the Oval Office listening to phone calls from American defenders desperately under siege and watching real-time video of developments from a drone circling over the site.  Yet they sent no military aid that might have intervened in time to save lives."" The Forbes article did not provide a source for writer Larry Bell’s reference to real-time video. In its article, Snopes noted that a CBS News story also posted Oct. 24, 2012, stated that the FBI and State Department had reviewed video from security cameras that captured the attack on the consulate. The CBS News report continued: ""The audio feed of the attack was being monitored in real time in Washington by diplomatic security official Charlene Lamb. CBS News has learned that video of the assault was recovered 20 days later from the more than 10 security cameras at the compound. The government security camera footage of the attack was in the possession of local Libyans until the week of Oct. 1,"" CBS News said. Earlier, on Oct. 12, 2012, the Daily Beast quoted two unidentified U.S. intelligence officials as saying that video taken the night of the attacks, showing a military-style assault took place, had been recovered the week before from the site of the attacks. ""The Obama administration has been studying the videos, taken from closed-circuit cameras throughout the Benghazi consulate’s four-building compound, for clues about who was responsible for the attack and how it played out,"" the story said. The story did not mention any live stream into the White House, though it said that in ""addition to the footage from the consulate cameras, the U.S. government is also poring over video taken from an overhead U.S. surveillance drone that arrived for the final hour of the night battle at the consulate compound and nearby annex."" Our search for news stories on such a live stream, using the Nexis database, led us to an Oct. 29, 2012, Slate news story noting a claim by Charles Woods, whose son, Tyrone, died in the attacks, that the White House watched the attacks on a live stream over seven hours. The story also notes the CBS News report of a drone flying over the fatal scene hours after the attacks began. Slate quoted a White House spokesman, Tommy Vietor, as saying: ""No one watched video of the attack at the White House as it happened."" Separately, as documented by Erik Wemple, who writes a ""reported opinion blog"" on the news media for The Washington Post, Fox News commentator Sean Hannity repeatedly incorrectly stated that the State Department watched live video as the attacks occurred. In a Jan. 23, 2013, news story, Wemple said that earlier that day, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton was asked before a House committee about live video feeds to the agency and replied: ""There was no monitor, there was no real time."" Earlier, on Oct. 26, 2012, Fox News said it had learned that ""there were two military surveillance drones redirected to Benghazi shortly after the attack on the consulate began. They were already in the vicinity. The second surveillance craft was sent to relieve the first drone, perhaps due to fuel issues. Both were capable of sending real-time visuals back to U.S. officials in Washington, D.C. Any U.S. official or agency with the proper clearance, including the White House Situation Room, State Department, CIA, Pentagon and others, could call up that video in real time on their computers."" The story did not say any video was watched inside the agencies. Our ruling Dewhurst said live video of the Benghazi attacks reached the White House as the attacks occurred. That’s not confirmed by news reports we found, while the White House said in October 2012 that no one there watched a live video feed. Given that this claim has been debunked for about a year, we see it as incorrect and ridiculous. Pants on Fire! PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim.

Rep. Louise Slaughter says 80% of antibiotics are fed to livestock
","A salmonella outbreak traced to California chicken processing plants recently prompted Rep. Louise Slaughter, D-N.Y., to raise a pet issue on MSNBC: antibiotic-resistant bacteria. The federal shutdown was limiting government’s ability to track infection, she said. But then she pointed to a deeper issue: ""the overuse and ruination of antibiotics."" An advocate for tougher requirements for farm use of such drugs, Slaughter told host Joy-Ann Reid that she’s been ""trying to save antibiotics for persons — for human beings."" ""Eighty percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock every single day, and it's creating a terrible problem of resistant bacteria,"" she said. Eighty percent is an awfully big number, and we were curious: Do livestock consume the bulk of the nation’s antimicrobial drugs? It’s an important question, because according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, wide use of antibiotics in food-producing animals ""contributes to the emergence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in food-producing animals."" Emergence of resistant bacteria means if you get infected with bacteria from the food you eat, it might be harder to fight that infection with antibiotics. Drug resistance may be contributing to higher hospitalization rates in the recent salmonella outbreak, for example, the Los Angeles Times reported. Here’s how it works, according to the CDC: Ranchers give animals antibiotics, which kills off or suppresses susceptible bacteria, but allows antibiotic-resistant bacteria to thrive. Those resistant bacteria may be transmitted to people through the food supply, such as by eating undercooked salmonella-tainted chicken. Since the bacteria are resistant to some antibiotics, the infections may be harder to fight, causing ""adverse human health consequences."" So CDC ""encourages and supports efforts to minimize inappropriate use of antibiotics in humans and animals."" You’re probably aware of this effort in humans — it’s why doctors are discouraged from giving their patients antibiotics to treat nonbacterial infections such as cold and flu. Widespread use of antibiotics when they’re not required helps bacteria develop defenses to the drugs in a sort of microscopic arms race. It’s also the reason the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has asked farmers to phase out certain antibiotics important to human medicine when used merely to promote growth in animals. (The industry says this accounts for a small amount of antibiotic use. The FDA says it’s hard to say.) So, back to the 80 percent number. It turns out it has been a popular talking point since 2010 among those who advocate for restricting use of antibiotics on farms. That’s the year the FDA released newly required data on sales of antibiotics by manufacturers for food-producing animals. The FDA didn’t release sales information on antibiotics for human use, but pointed to national projections from IMS Health, a Connecticut company that compiles proprietary health data. The numbers let folks compare the millions of kilograms of drugs sold by manufacturers for use by food-producing animals (13.1 million kilograms) in 2009 with those sold for use by people (3.3 million kilograms). The 13.1 million kilograms of antibiotics sold for animals was 80 percent of the total amount of drugs sold for both humans and animals, which was 16.4 million kilograms. We should note this comparison doesn’t account for all antibiotics sold in the United States. For example, it doesn’t count antibiotics sold for household pets. A researcher with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health’s Center for a Livable Future first did the math for a 2010 blog post that’s been widely cited. (The most recent reports reveal a similar proportion, as calculated by the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming.) Pharmaceutical company lobby groups such as the Animal Health Institute, though, have cried foul. It says the number is ""wrong and misleading, for several reasons,"" and cites the FDA. The FDA has indeed offered a ""caution regarding comparisons of human and animal antibacterial drug sales data."" It repeated some of those cautions in a 2012 letter to Slaughter herself. But while it offers a series of caveats about drawing ""definite conclusions"" from ""direct comparisons"" about the drug sales data  —  such as differences in dosages between different drugs and in the sizes of human and animal populations — it confirms both sets of sales data essentially measure the same thing. Both show the volume of antibacterial drugs, by weight, being sold to various outlets from the manufacturer. So, while they don’t offer a direct estimate of human or animal use, they do offer a comparison of sales by manufacturers for both groups. In 2011, the FDA provided the IMS Health sales estimates directly to Slaughter, describing the sales numbers as ""a surrogate for human use to compare to antibacterial drug use in animals."" We should note that about a third of the antibiotics used in food-producing animals are ionophores, a type not used in humans. (The agriculture industry argues this means they have nothing to do with antibiotic resistance in humans; Lawrence at Johns Hopkins says they may still contribute.) If you remove ionophores from the sales data comparison, the proportion of antibiotics that go to food-producing animals vs. humans drops to around 70 percent. There are also also plenty of limits, as the FDA points out, on the usefulness of the publicly released sales data to inform public policy on antibiotics on farms. They don’t illuminate the reasons animals get the drugs (to promote growth? to treat infection? both?). They don’t specify how the antibiotics are administered (injection? food?). The FDA’s asking for comments on how it might release more of the information it collects from animal drug companies, and says it will update reports from previous years with that new data. That might include, for example, a detail it confirmed to Slaughter’s office in a 2011 letter — that nearly all antibiotics reported for animal use to the FDA were delivered in food and water, as opposed to by injection. Meanwhile, the industry uses the current lack of detail to downplay the usefulness of the statistic, even as it fights efforts to gather and release more information. Sales data is ""not at all useful for understanding the benefits or the risks of using antibiotics to keep animals healthy,"" Ron Phillips of the Animal Health Institute told PolitiFact. Others disagree and argue that the data is actually quite revealing. ""There is some uncertainty in these data, but not enough to escape the fact that the vast majority of antibiotics in this country are used in food animals, not to treat sick people,"" wrote Robert Lawrence, a doctor who directs the Center for a Livable Future at Johns Hopkins. Slaughter, meanwhile, is sponsoring two bills, the Delivering Antimicrobial Transparency in Animals Act and the Preservation of Antibiotics for Medical Treatment Act, to require more detailed monitoring and to limit the use of antibiotics to sick animals. Among those lobbying against both: the Animal Health Institute. Our ruling Slaughter said ""80 percent of the antibiotics in this country are fed to livestock."" The statistic comes from a comparison of FDA sales data for food-producing animals and private sales data for humans since 2009 — not all antibiotics sold in the United States. A letter from the FDA to the congresswoman confirms that most of the drugs for livestock are consumed in food and water. That means the percentage ""fed"" to animals may not be quite as high as 80 percent, though it would be close. Slaughter could have said more clearly that of all the antibiotics sold for use by people and livestock, 80 percent are for animals. But she was close. We rate her statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBFB4480>],/factchecks/2013/oct/15/louise-slaughter/rep-louise-slaughter-says-80-antibiotics-are-fed-l/

Could selling the Portland Water House help stabilize rates?
","For many people, the dream of inheriting a nice house remains as elusive as that rich relative they wish they had. By contrast, the house Portland Commissioner Nick Fish inherited from former Commissioner Randy Leonard -- the much-maligned Water House -- has proved more nightmare than dream. The Northeast Portland demonstration project, completed in 2011 during Leonard’s tenure as the commissioner who oversaw the Portland Water Bureau, was supposed to be a marvel of innovation and money-saving technology. ""Water-friendly"" features include a rain garden and eco-lawn, and floors made of wood reclaimed from a school gym. However, the tinge of green most associated with the Water House isn’t the environmental angle, but the money it burned. Originally budgeted at $310,900, the project’s total costs with design, construction management and inspection staff time ballooned to nearly $950,000, according to Fish’s own tally. In August, two months after Mayor Charlie Hales assigned Fish to oversee the Water Bureau, Fish directed the bureau to sell the house. The $475,000 asking price, Fish said, would at least cover the Water House’s ""hard costs"" of $456,287. (The asking price has since been reduced to $439,000.) Then, in an article posted on the bureau’s website, he added this: ""We are going to sell this house and use the proceeds to stabilize rates."" PolitiFact Oregon wondered whether that amount could help stabilize water rates that have, for a variety of reasons, climbed steadily in recent years. To find out, we contacted Fish’s office and quickly received an email from the commissioner. Fish noted that it takes about a $1.3 million reduction in the bureau’s $480 million operating budget to get a 1 percent rate reduction for residential customers. So even if the bureau manages to find a buyer willing to plunk down the asking price, water rates would drop only by about one-third of 1 percent. Currently, the average single-family residential bill for water service in Portland is $27.61 a month, according to rates contained in the current budget. (Note, residential sewage rates, included in the same bills, are typically more than twice that. Most residents also pay quarterly, though we’re using monthly costs for simplicity.) So the typical family would see a savings of about 9 cents a month from the Water House’s sale. Further, Fish said, all proceeds from the sale will go into the bureau’s Rate Stabilization Account, a fund started in 2006 to smooth the effect of rate increases. Combined water and sewer rates have been driven higher in recent years by big-ticket projects, such as the $1.4 billion Big Pipe to keep sewer overflows from reaching the Willamette River, and work to comply with federal mandates to cover or replace the city’s open drinking-water reservoirs. PolitiFact Oregon, appreciating that every 9 cents counts, dug a little deeper by calling Cecelia Huynh, the Water Bureau’s finance director. Asked how much the Water House’s sale would help ratepayers, she said, ""Every dollar helps, but as far as a percentage, it’s not going to register. It is a one-time source of revenue."" Portland’s water rates, like those in cities across the region, have increased steadily in recent years. Unresolved questions of whether Bull Run water needs to be treated and how much it will cost to replace reservoirs could mean more increases in years to come. The Water Bureau’s Rate Stabilization Account is intended to smooth out short-term rate spikes. Managers this year used about $5.8 million of the fund’s $20.6 million to stabilize monthly water bills that otherwise would have increased more than the 3.6 percent jump that took effect July 1, Huyhn said. PolitiFact appreciates Fish’s making the best of the political haunted house he inherited from Leonard, but any effect the sale of the Water House will have on water rates is going to be a tiny drop in a very large bucket. Further, the fact that those proceeds will represent a one-time-only infusion blunts any effect even more. Money from the Water House’s sale will have no ability to stabilize water rates.

Democrats say U.S. Rep. Steve Daines won't back his own bill to end shutdown
","No great insight is necessary to predict that both parties will aim to use the government shutdown to their advantage in the 2014 elections. The political jabbing is already underway in the Montana Senate race to replace Sen. Max Baucus, a Democrat, who won’t run again. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee attacked Rep. Steve Daines, R-Mont., the state’s only House member and a likely contender for Baucus’ seat. ""Daines is irresponsibly doing everything he can to make sure the reckless Republican government shutdown continues no matter how dire the consequences are for Montana,"" the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee wrote in a press release. ""In fact, Daines is so thoroughly wedded to his partisan political shutdown that he opposes a vote on his own legislation that he proposed just a few months ago."" In this fact-check, we’ll look at whether Daines actually opposed a vote on a bill he introduced. We contacted the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and spokesman Justin Barasky noted that back in March, Daines cosponsored a bill called the Government Shutdown Prevention Act. The gist of the measure, endorsed by 16 Republicans and no Democrats, is that if the parties couldn’t come to terms, government agencies could stay open, funded at the same level they are today. If four months went by and there was still no deal, agencies would absorb a 1 percent cut, and that would be repeated every three months until a more durable bill passed. House Democrats are circulating a petition that would force an immediate vote by the full House on the bill. Known as a discharge petition, it would override House leadership and for that reason, it is an unusual move that reflects a breakdown of party control. Daines will not sign the petition, not that his Democratic colleagues invited him to. They sent letters to 30 Republican representatives, asking them to join the effort, and Daines was not on that list. The discharge petition is no ordinary parliamentary tactic. A petition of this sort succeeds only when the speaker’s hold on his own party has failed. A discharge petition with a twist In the view of the Democrats, Daines has failed to do all he could to put his legislation to a vote. But the real story is more complicated. If the Democrats got the 218 votes they needed, presumably 200 Democrats and 18 Republicans, the special rule they proposed would lead to an immediate floor vote on an amendment to strip the original language from the bill and replace it with Democratic version that simply funds the government at current levels. The parts about automatic spending decreases would be gone. If that amendment failed, the bill would go back to the House Appropriations Committee and there would be no vote by the full House on the original measure. So the discharge petition forces a vote on a substitute for Daines' bill; it doesn't force a vote on the original bill text itself. Alee Lockman, Daines’ communications director, said he won’t sign because what would emerge wouldn’t be his bill. ""The bill my boss cosponsored and the bill that would result through the Democrats’ discharge petition would not be the same,"" Lockman said. We contacted the office of another cosponsor of the bill, chair of the House Budget Committee Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis. His spokesman said for the same reason, he also had no plans to sign the petition. Independent analysts agree that Daines would not have the chance to vote on the measure he introduced. Donald Wolfensberger, an expert on House parliamentary procedure at the Wilson Center in Washington with long ties to the Republican party, affirmed that the Democratic measure ""completely replaces the base text."" Sarah Binder, a Brookings Institution fellow and professor of political science at George Washington University, said the Democrats’ petition leaves little room for what Daines had in mind. ""I think we're talking about two different measures, and thus refusing to sign the discharge petition on the resolution does not signal a member's unwillingness to vote for a bill that she or he cosponsored."" By Binder’s count, 407 discharge petitions have been filed since the end of WWII. Only 2 percent were successful. If you include instances when the threat of a petition forced House leaders to charge course, the track record rises but still only to 9 percent. Researchers Susan Miller and Marvin Overby at the University of Missouri looked at a dozen years of recent congressional activity, and their results tell us that Daines has a lot of company in refusing to sign a discharge petition for a bill he introduced. Miller and Overby found that when the sponsor or cosponsor comes from the party in power, they refuse to sign about 80 percent of the time. Our ruling The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee said Daines opposes a vote on legislation he introduced. Democrats are seeking House members to sign a discharge petition to bring the legislation Daines introduced for a vote, and Daines won’t sign. However, the Democratic move would take away all the relevant text of the original bill, replace it with new language, leaving in place only the original bill number. Independent experts said that Daines would be voting on a measure that is substantially different from the one he put his name to in March. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB7A59C0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/15/democratic-senatorial-campaign-committee/democrats-say-rep-steve-daines-wont-back-his-own-b/

GOP comes to Deal's defense on ethics
","In politics, one of the most important rules is never miss an opportunity to take a shot at the other side. Last month, Georgia’s Democratic and Republican parties attacked each other over the issue of ethics. The genesis of this fight was an Atlanta Journal-Constitution report that the head of Georgia's ethics commission is accused by current and former commission employees of improperly intervening in an investigation of Gov. Nathan Deal. ""Senate Dems Warned of State Ethics Oversight,"" read the headline of a news release by the Democrats the day the article was published.   The news release accused Deal, a Republican, of engaging in ""cronyism."" The governor strongly denied any involvement in the ethics case. The Georgia Republican Party sent out its own news release that day, as well. ""For over a century, Democrats occupied the Governor's Mansion and set the legislative agenda under the Gold Dome. Rather than prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government, they sat on their hands and did nothing,"" the Republican Party said in a statement. Surely, the Democrats passed some sort of ethics reform in the century it was in charge of the Georgia Legislature and in the governor’s office. Or maybe not. PolitiFact Georgia wanted to find out. PolitiFact Georgia took a look in the AJC’s digital archives, which go back to the mid-1980s. During that decade, leaders were aghast at the lack of oversight to prevent and punish public corruption in Georgia. The state’s bribery laws were widely considered to be too narrowly defined. News accounts of alleged bribery were as common as the mercury topping 90 degrees. ""It was a completely open world,"" University of Georgia political science professor Charles Bullock said. In 1990, lawmakers passed an ethics bill that included a cap on campaign contributions at $3,500. Not good enough, many said. In 1992, the Georgia Legislature passed House Bill 1125, legislation aimed at strengthening the state’s ethics laws and campaign finance guidelines for elected officials. The law required for the first time that lobbyists disclose every penny they spend trying to influence legislation. It also imposed new campaign contribution restrictions. The provisions included: No public officials shall accept more than $101 for a speech or similar activities that relate to the duties of their office; The names and dollar amounts of campaign contributions must be reported; Campaign contributions by individuals, political action committees and companies to statewide candidates are limited to $2,500; the limit is $1,000 for a Legislature candidate; Lobbyists must register themselves and pay an annual fee or face a fine up to $2,000. The legislation was crafted after a 50-member panel was created to study and make recommendations to improve Georgia’s ethics guidelines. The leader of that effort was then-Secretary of State Max Cleland, a DeKalb County Democrat who later became a U.S. senator. ""It's a phenomenal improvement in ethics laws in Georgia,"" Melissa Metcalfe, then director of the citizen lobby group Common Cause Georgia, said about the bill at the time. In 2000, the Georgia House of Representatives passed what the AJC reported at the time was its first formal code of conduct for itself. The code set up procedures for educating House members on ethics guidelines and for publishing a handbook containing rules and laws pertaining to ethical conduct. It also required an ethics training course for all newly elected members. The AJC noted some problems with the new code, such as it allowed lawmakers to take gifts of any value from anyone without disclosing them. It also gave them discretion to keep complaints filed against members confidential even after an initial finding of ""substantial evidence"" of a violation. Still, both the 1992 bill and the 2000 code were passed when Democrats were in control. Was the GOP trying to rewrite history here? Ryan Mahoney, a spokesman for the Georgia Republican Party, maintained the claim is accurate. ""Our claim is that while in power the Democrats did nothing to ‘prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government,’ "" Mahoney said via email. ""Passing two ethics-related bills in 130 years clearly isn't ‘prioritizing’ ethics reform. And creating a system ripe for corruption ... where lobbyists can spend unlimited amounts of money on lawmakers did not ‘restore trust in state government,’ "" he said. ""On the flip side, Republicans in just 10 short years have passed two comprehensive ethics reform bills. Clearly, they prioritize ethics reform and have done lots to restore trust in state government."" In 2002, Republican Sonny Perdue won the governorship and the GOP held the majority of seats in the Georgia Senate. In 2005, lawmakers passed an ethics bill that created a bipartisan House-Senate committee to look into legislative conflicts of interest, prohibited former lawmakers from returning to the Capitol as lobbyists for a year and extended lobbyist disclosure provisions to regulatory officials. Some complained that the bipartisan committee’s work would not be done in public. In 2010, the Legislature passed legislation that tightened reporting requirements for lobbyists and legislators and made it a crime to use state agencies or authority to attack or harass someone. Earlier this year, the Legislature approved a bill that caps gifts from registered lobbyists to government officials at $75. Lobbyists can continue to pay for lawmakers’ meals, cocktails and travel as long as the tab for any single expenditure does not exceed that amount. The cap is one of the more forgiving in the nation among states that allow such spending, but it does mark the first time any limits have been placed on the practice in Georgia. Emmet Bondurant, the former chairman of Georgia Common Cause, said the 1992 bill ""would had been considered significant ethics reform."" However, he said neither Democrats nor Republicans have been truly serious about ethics reform because they have not given the state ethics commission the ability to investigate potential conflicts of interest. ""The ethics commission has been largely confined to record-keeping,"" said Bondurant, whose wife once served on the commission. Bullock agreed that Georgia passed ethics guidelines on the Democrats’ watch, but he noted that states have gradually toughened their ethics laws in recent decades. In South Carolina, for example, lobbyists cannot buy lawmakers anything. Not even a cup of coffee. Mahoney stood by the claim. ""When you do the math and think about how long the Democrats were in charge, I think it’s abundantly clear who has prioritized ethics,"" he said. Again, the Georgia GOP news release said ""rather than prioritize and pass ethics reform measures to restore trust in state government, (Democrats) sat on their hands and did nothing"" when they were the majority in state government. A search back as recently as the 1980s clearly shows there were bills passed aimed at improving ethics in Georgia while Democrats were in charge.

Bill Foster's 'Rick Scott-inspired fire fee'? Here's the real story
","To political operatives, campaign mailers are often considered the most effective way to target voters, particularly in local elections. To fact-checkers, they’re often home to glaring distortions. Today’s example: A flier in the St. Petersburg mayor race that links incumbent Bill Foster, a $10 million fire fee and Republican Gov. Rick Scott. A headline on the mailer reads, ""Bill Foster's $10 million Rick Scott-inspired fire fee."" ""Foster’s $10 million fire fee would have charged you for services you already pay for. Sound familiar?"" the text continues. ""Instead of taking leadership by cutting fluff out of the budget, Bill Foster took a page out of Rick Scott’s Tallahassee playbook and tried to charge us millions of dollars in ‘fees’ that taxed you for services the government should have already been providing -- $10 million of them!"" The flier comes from Fact Check Florida, an electioneering communication organization, or ECO, that supports liberal candidates and is run by Jacksonville resident Matthew Martz. As an ECO, Fact Check Florida (nice name, by the way) can pay for ads that attack candidates, but it cannot expressly advocate for a candidate’s defeat or election. It can tell you why it thinks Foster is a bad guy but can’t tell you to vote for Foster’s opponent, Rick Kriseman. About the fire fee Yes, Foster pitched a fire readiness assessment, or ""fire fee"" in 2012 as a way to plug the city’s budget gap after another year of disappearing property tax revenues. But the idea was not ""inspired"" by Scott in any way. ""It was funny because it was from Fact Check Florida,"" Foster told us, ""and there was nothing factual about it."" In Foster’s first two years in office, the city made up for lost property tax revenues (a result of declining home values) by reducing positions and program spending. Foster criticized a potential fire fee as a ""backdoor tax increase"" in those years. But in 2012, he suggested that instead of more cuts, the City Council approve a new fire readiness fee that would total $9 million a year, which was about the amount needed to close its gap for 2013. The latest version of the proposal called for property owners to pay $50 a year per parcel and $.21 per $1,000 of its appraised structural value annually, according to Tampa Bay Times archives. Some council members criticized the fire fee as disproportionately punishing low-income residents by asking them to pay the same amount as wealthier residents. The council rejected the idea and instead raised the city’s property tax rate for the first time in two decades.   Foster recently tried to distance himself from the fire fee that he was linked to so closely in news coverage. With Kriseman using it as an example of failed leadership, Foster told the Tampa Bay Times that he did not come up with the proposal, pointing to records that showed council members asked the idea to be considered at a workshop eight months before they ultimately rejected it. (This revelation came after the mailpiece was distributed, so we don’t hold it against the group for not including.) The connection to Scott Let’s go back to the ad. At its most generous reading, the ad implies Foster followed Scott’s lead of raising fees for existing services. But that does not align with Scott’s record in office, which has not seen major tax or fee increases beyond increases to tuition. The state also has cut taxes and fees for Floridians since Scott took office. You can read about that here. Fact Check Florida's Martz defended the mailer. While the fee was ""obviously"" not Scott’s idea, he said, it’s similar to Tallahassee Republicans who ""keep coming up with tiny ways to take money out of voters’ pockets without them noticing."" ""Under Rick Scott, it was with tuition rates,"" he said. ""And before he got there, the Republicans did it with driver’s license renewals and things."" Martz’s last point refers to $2.2 billion in increased taxes and fees that Republican lawmakers passed in 2009 -- before Scott became governor. The St. Petersburg mayor’s race is nonpartisan, but the injection of Scott highlights the political differences between the two candidates. Foster is a Republican who has Scott’s endorsement, while Kriseman is Democrat whose campaign is being partly financed by the Florida Democratic Party. Another third-party group led by Tallahassee lobbyist David Ramba is attacking Kriseman in a separate mailer for sharing partisan policies akin to the ones that brought about the government shutdown. The evolution was inevitable after the city voted in 1993 to move to a strong mayor system, argues Darryl Paulson, University of South Florida St. Petersburg professor emeritus of government. In the case of this ad, tying Foster with an unpopular governor appeals to the emotions of voters, Paulson said. ""The Democrats are in essence trying to say that even though it’s not a partisan race, look who is supporting Foster, and we as Democrats hate the governor,"" Paulson said. ""It’s really designed as a get out the vote effort to get Democratic voters to to vote in a nonpartisan election."" Our ruling A mailpiece attempts to connect Foster’s rejected proposal for a fire readiness fee with Scott. This is junk mail.

Capitol Hill closures due to partial government shutdown included the House's 'official' dry cleaners
","A Texas congressman said he’s running low on shirts due to the partial shutdown of the federal government that took effect Oct. 1, 2013. An Oct. 11, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news article on the views of Austin U.S. Reps. Roger Williams, a Republican, and Lloyd Doggett, a Democrat, quoted Williams as saying that he favors spending cuts and opposes an increase in the federal debt limit. Williams also indicated he’s not happy about the shutdown. ""I didn’t want the government to shut down, I didn’t get my laundry out"" of the congressional laundry before it shut down, Williams said. Doggett said he didn’t know there was a congressional laundry. We’re here to serve. Did the federal shutdown also shutter a congressional laundry? By email, spokeswomen for Williams and Doggett each said a dry cleaning store housed in a Capitol office building shut its doors due to the government shutdown. Williams spokeswoman Haley Graves said: ""The laundry is just a local laundry/dry cleaning branch that’s located on the Capitol complex and open to the public. It was closed due to the shutdown, so anyone who dropped off suits/shirts/alterations before Oct. 1 aren’t able to get them out at this time."" Doggett spokeswoman Kelsey Crow agreed the basement laundry, which we identified as ClassiCleaners in the Longworth House Office Building, closed due to the shutdown. A web search led us to a Feb. 23, 2010, article in American Drycleaner, a trade publication, stating the House had chosen ClassiCleaners ""as its new, official ‘green’ drycleaning service provider."" Crow also emailed us a photo (posted above) showing what looks like the door to a ClassiCleaners store with two signs, one saying ""Closed"" and the other stating: ""Due to the government shutdown, this facility is closed."" We repeatedly telephoned the ClassiCleaners and every time got disconnected. But a search of The Washington Post led us to a Sept. 26, 2013, post on the newspaper’s Federal Eye blog stating that if the federal shutdown occurred, Capitol Hill ""service providers"" required to close would include stationery stores, ""the dry cleaners"" and other offices. The article linked to undated web pages overseen by the House Administration Committee including one forecasting the open/closed status of Capitol facilities in the event of a government shutdown. According to the committee, the House ""cleaners"" would be open from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. Oct. 3, 2013, which we took as an indication it otherwise would be closed. According to the committee’s page, the House stationery, gift, beauty and barber shops also were to be closed. Our ruling Williams said a congressional laundry was closed due to the government shutdown. Save for a few hours the first Thursday of October, the House’s official cleaners was closed in connection with the partial government shutdown. We rate this claim as True.

McDonnell says U.S. Senate hasn't passed a budget in 4-1/2 years
","During an Oct. 2 interview on Fox News, Gov. Bob McDonnell said there is a pox on both political parties for causing the federal government’s partial shutdown.

McDonnell, a Republican, noted that 49 states require the passage of balanced budgets each year. That includes Virginia.

That Truth-O-Meter item said Senate hadn’t passed a budget since April 29, 2009.  But things have changed.

"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Kim Guadagno']","
Kim Guadagno claims Chris Christie hasn't raised taxes on anyone
","New Jersey has plenty of reason to re-elect Chris Christie next month, according to Kim Guadagno, his lieutenant governor. In addition to sticking to his principles, Christie, a Republican, has been a strong steward of residents’ money during his time as governor, Guadago said to supporters Monday in Carlstadt. Guadagno was filling in for Christie, who had to cancel his appearance at the last minute. ""He has not increased taxes on anyone,"" the lieutenant governor told the crowd. Christie also has made this claim a few times, but the Truth-O-Meter’s stance on it remains the same from the first time we fact-checked it: the consequences of some of Christie’s budget-cutting actions have resulted in tax increases for some New Jerseyans. And PolitiFact New Jersey isn’t the only fact-checking group to say so. Our truth-seeking colleagues at FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, have called the governor out for claiming not to have raised taxes. Let’s start with some background on how New Jersey generates tax revenue. The state’s three biggest revenue generators are the gross income, sales and corporation business taxes, none of which have increased since Christie took office on Jan. 19, 2010. So Guadagno is correct that the governor has not actually raised any of those taxes. But other actions by the governor cut tax relief for those who relied on support from programs such as the Earned Income Tax Credit and other credits. In the eyes of some experts that means certain New Jerseyans had less money to pay their taxes, and the impact of the cuts was essentially a tax increase for those residents. The EITC is a credit given certain residents who work and have earned income. It reduces the amount of New Jersey tax owed and may result in a refund, even if those eligible for the credit owe the state no taxes, according to the state Treasury Department. Treasury Department spokesman Bill Quinn has said that in many cases, the EITC represented a subsidy to low-income people, and more than three-quarters of New Jerseyans who received the credit in 2010 actually owed the state no tax. Still, New Jersey cut the EITC during Christie’s first year in office. Christie also cut spending for two property tax relief programs, one of which -- now known as the Homestead Benefit program -- more than halved the average rebate that exceeded $1,000. Although state Treasury Department officials have argued that tax credit programs are payments from the state and reductions in credits do not represent tax increases, some experts disagree. Dennis J. Ventry, Jr., a professor at University of California Davis School of Law, previously told PolitiFact New Jersey that a reduction in a tax credit is  ""absolutely a tax increase,"" while Richard Pomp, a professor of law at the University of Connecticut and state taxation expert has said, ""To someone who has had a benefit cut that is less money they have to spend,"" whether you call it a tax increase or a spending cut. Joseph Henchman, vice president of legal and state projects at the Tax Foundation, a business-backed group, has said it would be a mistake to equate reductions in tax credits as tax increases or spending cuts. ""They have elements of both and are strictly neither,"" Henchman said. Kevin Roberts, spokesman for Christie's gubernatorial campaign, said previous administration comments on this topic stand. ""There have been no tax increases under this Governor,"" he said in an e-mail. Our ruling Guadagno said about Christie in a speech to supporters in Carlstadt, """"He has not increased the taxes on anyone."" It’s true that the governor has not increased the rate of taxation for New Jersey’s three biggest revenue generators: the gross income, business and sales taxes. But it’s also true that he has cut tax credit programs that resulted in some New Jerseyans having less money to pay their tax bills. In the eyes of some experts, that’s still a tax increase.

"['Foreign Policy', 'Military', 'Wisconsin', 'Paul Ryan']","
Did Paul Ryan change his position on a red line and chemical weapons in Syria?
","In the 2012 campaign, Paul Ryan repeatedly criticized President Barack Obama’s foreign policy but agreed with Obama that use of chemical weapons by the regime in Syria was a ""red line"" that would prompt U.S. action. A year later, after Obama asserted the line had been crossed, it was Ryan who came in for criticism when he opposed the president’s call for a military strike aimed at weakening Syrian President Bashar Assad’s forces. Did Ryan reverse his position on the ""red line,"" as some commentators and news reports said? Let’s test this on the Flip-O-Meter. First, our standard disclaimer: The Flip-O-Meter does not measure whether any change in position is good politics or good policy, but simply whether a political figure has changed his or her position. Our research starts with 2011 comments by Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman and 2012 GOP vice presidential nominee who is widely considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate. In a 2011 speech at the Hamilton Society, Ryan endorsed a larger military and a more activist role in the world for the United States. He decried ""brutal crackdowns"" by various regimes, saying, ""We have a responsibility to speak boldly for those whose voices are denied by the jackbooted thugs of the tired tyrants of Syria and Iran."" So in 2011 Ryan used tough language, but was vague what actions were appropriate and when they should be taken. Comments in 2012 We found little else from Ryan regarding Syria until the fall 2012 campaign, when Ryan had been added to the GOP ticket by presidential candidate Mitt Romney. As could be expected, Ryan echoed his running mate’s criticisms of Obama’s approach in Syria. Amid reports that Assad might be preparing to use chemical weapons, Obama was asked at an Aug. 19, 2012 news conference ""whether you envision using U.S. military, if simply for nothing else, the safekeeping of the chemical weapons."" Obama responded: ""We have been very clear to the Assad regime, but also to other players on the ground, that a red line for us is we start seeing a whole bunch of chemical weapons moving around or being utilized. That would change my calculus."" He added: ""We cannot have a situation where chemical or biological weapons are falling into the hands of the wrong people."" Major media outlets generally agreed that Obama was, directly or indirectly, warning Syria it could face American military intervention. In the October 2012 vice-presidential debate with Joe Biden, Ryan bought into Obama’s ""red line"" rhetoric. But first, he complained fiercely that Obama had dallied while Assad slaughtered tens of thousands of Syrians and al-Qaida had entered the fight. Ryan said Obama had failed to aid moderate dissident elements in the country, wrongly gave Russian leader Vladimir Putin veto power over U.S. efforts to deal with Syria, and neglected relationships with allies in the region. Pressed on what Romney-Ryan would do if elected, Ryan said they agreed with Obama’s ""red line"" on chemical weapons. And Ryan, echoing Romney’s call for a tougher line, put some meat on the bone, endorsing American ground troops in Syria for the limited purpose of securing chemical weapons in the context of a ""red line."" Ryan emphasized that was the only scenario for U.S. boots on the ground. Ryan’s comments didn’t tell us much about the nature of any military action in case of a red line violation. But he made clear he was willing to use U.S. troops in Syria to secure chemical weapons. Comments in 2013 Fast forward to Aug. 21, 2013, almost exactly one year after Obama’s ""red line"" remark. On that day, international chemical weapons inspectors now say, a deadly attack on opposition-held suburbs of Damascus included the use of the nerve agent sarin. The Associated Press reported that the United States and its allies alleged the Syrian government was responsible. After the attack, Obama threatened missile strikes against Assad, then unexpectedly sought congressional approval for them, and then stepped back when Russian-led diplomatic efforts led to an ongoing United Nations-backed mission to scrap Syria’s capacity to make chemical weapons and destroy its stockpile. Critics said Obama’s twists and turns on a military strike undermined the notion of a tough response, and in Syria the delays angered residents and disappointed opposition leaders. Notably, Obama did not propose American troops on the ground. Next came Obama’s announcement on Aug. 31, 2012 that he would seek congressional approval for a military strike. Ryan briefly commented, saying, ""The President has some work to do to recover from his grave missteps in Syria. He needs to clearly demonstrate that the use of military force would strengthen America's security. I want to hear his case to Congress and to the American people."" Then, on Sept. 11, 2013, a day after Obama addressed the nation and with Obama still seeking congressional approval for a strike, Ryan announced his opposition, while the House’s two top GOP leaders backed a strike. Ryan’s lengthy statement said a lot about why Obama was off track but left us wondering about Ryan’s own views on military intervention. At various points he seemed clearly to suggest Obama’s proposed military strike was too small, calling it a ""feeble"" deterrent and too ""limited"" to degrade chemical-weapons capabilities when a ""firm response"" was needed. Ryan also repeated his 2012 criticisms that Obama had failed to aid rebels and had deferred to Russia. But at points he appeared to question the wisdom of any strike, saying, ""A military strike could kill innocent civilians and earn the ire of everyone involved"" and ""drop America's standing in the Middle East even further."" Ryan didn’t rule anything out, saying America must ""carefully weigh all options."" His statement ended with a proposal for action that did not mention military intervention: ""Instead of the proposals put forth by the President, we should tighten sanctions on Assad's regime and give aid to the moderate elements of the opposition. "" Asked to clarify Ryan’s position on military intervention, aide Kevin Seifert told us: ""Paul Ryan’s concerns aren’t limited to ‘size,’ they are about the strategy."" He continued: ""It’s the mismatch between the president’s stated objective and the proposed strategy to achieve it."" Seifert would not say how Ryan would view another proposal for military intervention came before Congress. More comments Four days after Ryan put out his September 2013 statement, the ""UpFront with Mike Gousha"" show aired an interview with Ryan in which he expressed deep pessimism about using inspections to get the chemical weapons out. Gousha cited Ryan’s debate position that agreed with Obama on a ""red line"" and asked him why he had now changed his position. Ryan said he had not changed his position; he just found Obama’s specific proposal to be incoherent. Gousha followed up: ""Bottom line, do you think we should take military action because Syria used chemical weapons on its people?"" Ryan, shaking his head from side to side, responded strictly in the context of Obama’s plan: ""No. No, I do not believe he should do this because I don’t think this administration has any game plan for any of the contingencies surrounding it."" For additional perspective on Ryan, we spoke to Michael O’Hanlon, director of research for the Foreign Policy program at the Brookings Institution, and UCLA history professor and Middle East scholar James Gelvin. They offered differing interpretations of Ryan’s comments, but neither saw a full reversal by the congressman. O’Hanlon saw an inconsistency in Ryan rejecting Obama’s plan as too meek while Ryan himself earlier had specifically endorsed nothing more muscular for taking on Assad. Gelvin sees Ryan’s position as opportunistic politically but fairly consistent from a policy standpoint. He believes Ryan is in the foreign-policy camp that says, if we’re going to use force, do it big. Our rating Ryan has said all along he wanted more aggressive help for moderate groups fighting Assad. But here we’re testing whether his position has changed regarding a U.S. military response to Syrian use of chemical weapons. We know that after Obama drew the red line suggesting some sort of military intervention, Ryan endorsed that general idea, then 11 months later rejected Obama’s plan for it. But we don’t see a major reversal of position here -- in part because Ryan’s views on what to do about chemical weapons were ill-defined in 2012 and remain so now. It’s true Ryan rejected Obama’s proposed limited strike once chemical weapon use became reality, but he says he did so because of objections to Obama’s timing, strategy and execution. We found no evidence Ryan had previously backed -- or rejected -- this kind of limited strike. And he still says military intervention remains an option. His statements contain some inconsistencies, however. In 2012, Ryan said American ground troops would be an appropriate response if a red line was crossed, but his position on that is now unclear because he won’t answer questions about it. And the September 2013 statement he issued is a model of confusion as opposed to his feisty debate comments. In it, he strongly implied Obama’s strike was too small and not forceful enough, but then threw water on a limited strike because it could kill civilians. For those inconsistencies, we rate this a Half Flip.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB93CCC0>],/factchecks/2013/oct/13/paul-ryan/did-paul-ryan-change-his-position-red-line-and-che/
"['Rhode Island', 'Children', 'Families', 'Labor', 'Unions', 'Jennifer Parrish']","
Child-care activist Jennifer Parrish says number of children in subsidized child care fell by 20,000 in Illinois after labor union began representing providers
","Whether independent home-based child-care providers in Rhode Island should join a labor union is a hot-button issue in Rhode Island right now. In the last General Assembly session, legislators passed a bill -- signed into law by Governor Chafee -- that requires the state to bargain collectively with the nearly 600 providers if they opt to have a union. The providers are scheduled to vote Oct. 26-30 whether to be represented by Service Employees International Union 1199. The union-organizing campaign prompted Jennifer B. Parrish, a child-care provider in Minnesota, to write an essay published Sept. 5, 2013, by The Providence Journal in which she expressed her opposition to union representation of home-based child-care providers. One of Parrish’s points caught our eye: ""Six years after unionization, 20,000 fewer children in Illinois were being served by the Child Care and Development Fund program."" Contacted by PolitiFact Rhode Island, Parrish said union involvement prompted child-care providers to leave Illinois’ federal- and state-financed child-care program, so fewer children were served. The providers’ resistance to paying up to $900 in annual union dues was a significant factor, Parrish contended. Parrish said dozens of licensed child-care providers in Illinois have told her that they shunned union affiliation and left the subsidized program. We had two questions: Were 20,000 fewer children being served and, if so, was the decrease related to unionization? First, a little background. Conservative and anti-union groups have vigorously opposed efforts in several states to unionize home-based child-care workers. The U.S. Supreme Court has decided to hear a challenge to the Illinois unionization law. A federal judge halted a unionization campaign in Minnesota, pending the Supreme Court challenge. In Rhode Island, unionization opponents tried unsuccessfully to delay a union vote. To check Parrish’s claim, we first went where she went, to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Administration for Children & Families, which publishes state-by-state data regarding the Child Care and Development Program. We were interested in the six-year period that Parrish cited, from Oct. 1, 2005, (Illinois workers became unionized in 2006) through Sept. 30, 2011. In the 2006 federal fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, 2005, a monthly average of 82,200 children were served in Illinois by the federally subsidized program. By 2011, the figure had dropped to an estimated 63,000, a decrease of 19,200, or nearly 24 percent -- very close to Parrish’s 20,000 number. But there’s a couple of important caveats. First, the federal program counts children in all kinds of child care, not just home-based care, the focus of Parrish’s commentary. When you focus only on home-based care, the number of children served fell from 36,168 in 2006 to an estimated 27,090 in 2011. That’s a decrease of 9,078 -- a 25-percent drop. That’s a substantial decrease but it’s less than half of the number Parrish cited. And the second caveat: In addition to the unionization effort, several factors could have contributed to the drop, including changes in the rules regarding who is eligible for a subsidy. Tellingly, the number of all child-care providers in that period fell about 11 percent, while the drop in unionized home-based providers was only 3 percent. Parrish acknowledged in an interview that other factors were at play but insisted that providers’ reluctance to be union-affiliated was a significant factor. Because of the government shutdown, we couldn’t get any federal officials to discuss the figures. And neither the governor’s office nor the Illinois Department of Human Services, which oversees the child-care subsidy program, responded to our questions. Two Illinois child-care advocacy groups confirmed there were decreases in the numbers of children served, but they disputed Parrish on the reasons for the decreases. Larry Joseph, director of the fiscal policy center of Voices for Illinois Children, and Sessy Nyman, vice president of policy and strategic partnerships for Illinois Action for Children, both attributed the decreases to the economy, to a tightening of state qualifications for home-based providers, to a tightening of eligibility requirements for children, and to an increase in the co-payments for children’s parents. Joseph said he knew of no evidence linking the decrease to unionization of providers. Said Nyman: ""We do lose families in a bad economy."" Parents lose their jobs or work fewer hours and do not need a child-care subsidy because they are home to mind their children, she said.   She called the union link ""an assumption"" based on political ideology. (Voices for Illinois Children and Illinois Action for Children said they count the SEIU, which represents Illinois child-care providers and wants to represent Rhode Island child-care providers, as an ally.) Our ruling Child-care proprietor Jennifer B. Parrish said 20,000 fewer children, were served in an Illinois child-care program subsidized by the federal government, after a labor union began representing child-care providers. That was very close to the decrease in the number of children served by all child-care programs. But we found that the decrease in the number of children in home-based care -- what Parrish was talking about -- was actually about 9,100. Parrish offered only anecdotal evidence that the drop was related to unionization and two Illinois advocacy groups said it was more likely caused by other factors, such as the economic downturn and tightening of state qualifications for providers and eligibility requirements for children. Because the statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, the judges rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD52900>],/factchecks/2013/oct/13/jennifer-parrish/hild-care-activist-jennifer-parrish-says-number-ch/

Campaign mailer says Amanda Murphy has ""two vacation homes around the world""
","The race to succeed Mike Fasano in the state House is producing a glut of attack ads, including two recent mailers that stand out. One claims that Democrat Amanda Murphy is out of touch with average voters and wouldn't be available, literally, because she'll be at her ""Cancun vacation home."" The other says Republican Bill Gunter would ""drain millions"" from public education and give the money to for-profit schools. With the House District 36 election set for Oct. 15, 2013, PolitiFact Florida decided to test the accuracy of these noteworthy mailers. Here, we'll examine the ad claiming that Murphy has two vacation homes. (We'll look at the attack on Gunter's views on public education in a separate fact-check.) The ad attacking Murphy is personal in tone. Above a picture of a beach dotted with cabanas overlooking crystal-blue water, it says: ""Amanda Murphy: Out to lunch — at her Cancun vacation home."" It continues: ""It's bad enough we can't trust Amanda Murphy with our money, but with two vacation homes around the world, can Amanda Murphy really relate to the challenges we face?"" Like the other ad, it showed up in mailboxes a couple of weeks ago. Citizens for Fairness, an electioneering communications organization based in Melbourne, produced the ad. Efforts to reach the group's chairperson, Carmella K. Falcone, were unsuccessful. We can't rate whether Murphy is trustworthy ""with our money"" on the Truth-O-Meter, but voters may find her financial disclosures informative. State Division of Elections reports indicate she earned $176,047 last year as an investment adviser at Raymond James Financial. She earns well more than the average Pasco resident. Her income is roughly three times higher than the $51,000 median family income in Pasco, according to U.S. Census data. Her biggest asset is her house in New Port Richey, valued at $157,480. Based on August sales data, her home is worth about 65 percent more than the average New Port Richey home valued at about $95,000. Here's where the ad veers from the truth: Murphy's net worth is listed as $243,817 and includes a $12,900 timeshare in a Cocoa Beach condominium and half a timeshare worth $7,362 in a condo in Cabo San Lucas on Mexico's Baja California peninsula. A time share — which typically entitles the owner to a week or two of use of the space each year — is hardly comparable to owning a second (or third) home in a pricey vacation spot. So the claim she has ""two vacation homes around the world,"" including in Cancun, is misleading. It suggests Murphy owns the homes when in fact she owns a time share in a Florida condo and half a share in a condo in Cabo San Lucas — not in Cancun, which is on the Yucatán Peninsula about 1,480 miles to the east. Elsewhere, the ad calls Murphy a ""Wall Street broker,"" suggesting she works among the financial giants far removed the problems of Pasco voters. It's true Raymond James is a brokerage, but it's a regional brokerage based in St. Petersburg, not in New York City. Murphy works out of the company's Tampa office. The ad attempts to portray Murphy as an out-of-touch millionaire but uses flimsy evidence to support that picture.

Campaign mailer says Bill Gunter would cut funding for public schools and give money to out-of-state, for-profit schools
","The race to succeed Mike Fasano in the state House is producing a glut of attack ads, including two recent mailers that stand out. One claims that Democrat Amanda Murphy is out of touch with average voters and wouldn't be available, literally, because she'll be at her ""Cancun vacation home."" The other says Republican Bill Gunter would ""drain millions"" from public education and give the money to for-profit schools. With the House District 36 election set for Oct. 15, 2013, PolitiFact Florida decided to test the accuracy of these noteworthy mailers. Here, we'll examine the ad targeting Gunter's view on public education, which showed up in mailboxes a couple weeks ago. (We'll look at the attack against Murphy in a separate fact-check.) ""Gunter would drain millions from local public schools, and give our tax dollars to private, for-profit schools run by out-of-state corporations,"" the ad says. The Florida Democratic Party financed the mailer. It cites aTimes article, a preview of the Republican primary, published Sept. 13. In the story, three Republicans seeking the nomination weighed in on whether funding to public schools should be increased. Gunter said he opposed increased state funding for education and suggested the private sector play a larger role, a statement he alluded to at least twice before: at a Sept. 4 candidates debate and in a questionnaire, where he stated: ""Money isn't the issue. . . . Highest per pupil spending districts are some of the worst in the nation."" None of his statements referenced ""for-profit schools run by out-of-state corporations."" Joshua Karp, spokesman for the Florida Democratic Party, said freezing educational spending at its present level would result in cuts to Pasco schools to offset rising expenses. Also, diverting state funding to the private sector, or charter schools, takes away money from public schools, he said. Olga Swinson, chief financial officer for Pasco schools and the past president of Florida School Finance Officers Association, said a state funding freeze might result in budget cuts if costs for salaries, pensions, insurance, utilities, maintenance and other services go up at the same time. Many of those costs have indeed increased in recent years, leading to cuts. ""With every fund that we have, we would have to make do or we would have to start cutting programs,"" she said. Whether those cuts would amount to ""draining millions"" from the district is debatable, but Swinson wouldn't rule out the possibility and explained that the depth of cuts would depend on how much insurance, maintenance, pensions and other costs increase. Enrollment levels and local revenue streams would influence spending as well. Additionally, there's little evidence to the Democrats' claim that earmarking state funds to charter schools would enrich ""for-profit schools run by out-of-state corporations."" Most of the seven charter schools operating in Pasco are locally owned. The Imagine Charter School of Land O'Lakes is owned by a Virginia-based company. The ad makes broad assumptions that district costs would swell by millions of dollars, leading to cuts, that local revenues wouldn't keep pace and that charter schools owned by out-of-state companies would get tax money. That's a lot of assuming. Still, history shows that education costs are consistently on the rise. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD7F140>],/factchecks/2013/oct/12/florida-democratic-party/campaign-mailer-says-bill-gunter-would-cut-funding/

Jeanne Shaheen says 96 percent of employers in New Hampshire are small businesses
","The ramifications of the lingering federal government shutdown have varied in New Hampshire and across the country. With the federal shutdown entering its ninth day on Wednesday, Oct. 9, 2013, U.S. Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., took to the floor of the Senate to catalogue some of the hardships facing people in her home state as a result. Shaheen said hundreds of federal workers have been furloughed in New Hampshire. Some have been allowed to return to work, but the shutdown is still hitting employees of the U.S. Forest Service -- who work in the White Mountain National Forest -- and is closing down government-backed loan programs. Shaheen said access to credit is the lifeblood of small businesses in New Hampshire, and as many as 20 loan applications from businesses in the state submitted to the U.S. Small Business Administration since the shutdown began are now on hold. ""New Hampshire’s truly a small business state,"" Shaheen said. ""Ninety six percent of employers in the Granite State are considered small businesses, and they’re the backbone of our economy."" We were curious about whether that figure is accurate, so we contacted Shaheen’s office for clarification. A Shaheen spokesman pointed us to research by the U.S. Small Business Administration. A threshold of 500 employees is used ""for research purposes"" by the Small Business Administration’s Office of Advocacy, an independent advocate for small business within the federal agency. By that measure, small businesses represent 96.1 percent of all employers in New Hampshire, according to the latest available data, which came from 2010. However, the definition of ""small business"" is more complicated than one might think. For loans and other programs, the SBA uses a more complex standard. The company has to be independently owned and operated and ""not dominant in its field."" Depending on the industry, the threshold can be either an average number of employees for the past 12 months or a three-year average of revenues. For instance, a manufacturing firm could be considered ""small"" if it has anywhere from 500 to 1500 employees, depending on the type of product manufactured. Service providers would qualify as small if their annual receipts are lower than $2.5 million to $21.5 million, again depending on the particular service being provided. For retailing, the annual receipts threshold ranges from $5 million to $21 million. Using this narrower definition means the percentage of New Hampshire employers considered small businesses would be even higher than Shaheen cited. According to the SBA’s Office of Advocacy small businesses are ""crucial to the fiscal condition"" of New Hampshire, providing roughly half of all private sector jobs in the state. Small business statistics are similar nationwide. In all 50 states, between 93 percent and 99 percent of employers are considered small businesses. New Hampshire is actually on the lower end of the spectrum, ranking 44th on the list of states with the highest percentage. Most of New Hampshire’s small businesses are very tiny. About three quarters of them are actually considered ""nonemployers,"" meaning they have zero paid employees. Of those businesses that have workers on the payroll, most have fewer than 20 employees. For some entrepreneurs, government-backed loans are a crucial source of credit to start or expand a business. The 7(a) loan program is the Small Business Administration’s major effort to help business owners who don’t qualify for a traditional bank loan. SBA guarantees to repay the lender a majority of the loan if the business owner defaults on payments. The Provident Bank, which has locations in Massachusetts and New Hampshire, is one of SBA’s prefered lenders for the 7(a) program. In New Hampshire alone, The Provident Bank has at least half a dozen 7(a) loan applications that cannot be processed because SBA has placed the 7(a) program on hold during the government shutdown, according to president Chuck Withee. ""The SBA has reported that loans are not being originated, and you don’t need a Ph.D. in economics to understand that if small businesses can’t access capital and credit, that there are real economic consequences,"" Shaheen said. Our ruling Shaheen said that 96 percent of employers in the Granite State are considered small businesses. Shaheen specifically cited the Small Business Administration and their threshold of 500 employees is a long-standing and widely used definition. Other definitions used by the SBA say a company with as many as 1,500 employees and up to $21 million in revenue, can be considered small, which may defy belief.   Under the common definition, SBA calculates the number of small businesses in New Hampshire at 96.1 percent, so Shaheen was correct under either definition. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB71380>],/factchecks/2013/oct/11/jeanne-shaheen/jeanne-shaheen-says-96-percent-employers-new-hamps/

Bill Burton says Rep. Eric Cantor called deal with Democrats a win
","Whatever damage Democrats might incur through the government shutdown, they have found some satisfaction in trying to highlight the gap between House Republican leaders and their more tea party-oriented members. Former White House deputy press secretary Bill Burton worked that theme in an appearance on CNN’s Crossfire. In response to the charge that President Barack Obama and Senate Democrats are unwilling to negotiate, Burton shot back, ""We have negotiated a deal that Republicans wanted, that Eric Cantor said would be a win."" We wanted to verify the claim that House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Va., had signed off on a deal. But before we do that, it’s helpful to put Burton’s comment into the context of the rapid fire exchange on Crossfire. In that conversation, the issues of re-opening the government and avoiding a default on the national debt became intertwined. At one point, Burton said ""If there is a bipartisan majority that will pass this that we can use to avert this shutdown, why the theatrics? Why flirt with disaster?"" A few moments later, co-host S.E. Cupp pressed Burton on the debt ceiling. Cupp: ""I'm saying, attach the debt ceiling to spending cuts, deficit reduction ...And you haven't answered yet why the president won't negotiate if he thinks defaulting is so catastrophic."" Burton: ""Well, two things, ... No. 1, he has negotiated. We have negotiated a deal that Republicans wanted, that Eric Cantor said would be a win."" Burton used the deal on a stop-gap spending bill to counter the claim that Obama is unwilling to negotiate. But the question was aimed at negotiations on the debt ceiling. The temporary spending deal Burton had in mind broke down when House Republican leaders failed to bring their fellow Republicans along. However, keeping the government open technically is a separate issue from raising the debt limit. Cantor and the budget deal We contacted Burton’s office for details on Cantor’s role leading up to the shutdown. They sent us to a memo Cantor wrote to his fellow Republicans in early September. In it, he told them to expect a short-term continuing resolution to keep the government open. Such a resolution, Cantor wrote, would be ""at sequester levels"" and ""contain $64 billion in less spending compared to the current funding levels President Obama signed into law a mere five months ago."" If Obama signed off on that, Cantor continued, Obama ""would be endorsing a level of spending that wipes away all the increases he and congressional Democrats made while they were in charge and returns us to a pre-2008 level of discretionary spending."" Cantor ended his memo on an upbeat note: ""Upon return to Washington, if we stay focused on our solutions and how they can benefit all Americans dealing with their everyday challenges, I am convinced we will achieve more significant policy victories in the months ahead."" That leaves little doubt that Cantor saw a short-term continuing resolution in a positive light. It wouldn’t necessarily be the resounding victory that Burton suggested but it was something Cantor could say was a net gain for the GOP. We asked Cantor’s office if Burton had captured the gist of Cantor’s memo. ""We were simply laying out our legislative agenda at the time,"" Cantor’s press secretary Megan Whittemore said. ""We believe maintaining current spending levels is a good thing, which is why that was included in every one of our CR solutions which passed the House,"" Whittemore said. ""We also believe we must tackle the challenges of ObamaCare, which was also addressed in all of our CR solutions."" While Cantor’s memo does lay out a strategy to defund and delay Obamacare, he kept that separate from the section on a continuing resolution. That’s consistent with what we now know was the House Republican leadership plan. Several news articles described a deal struck between House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nev., back in July. On national television, Boehner did not rebut that there was an understanding that there would be a cut, in the range of $70 billion, in exchange for a clean continuing resolution, one that said nothing about defunding the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. Three days after the memo appeared on the Web, the National Review reported that Cantor planned to bring two measures to the floor. One would be the continuing resolution and the other would amend that resolution to defund Obamacare. Both items would go to the Senate separately with the expectation that the Senate would pass the spending resolution and kill the amendment. The president would then be able to sign a clean bill. But a week after that, Cantor’s plan crumbled under pressure from members of his party who were unwilling to compromise. About two dozen House Republicans refused to sign on to any measure that funded Obamacare. Ultimately, they prevailed and the House Republican leadership efforts to avert a shutdown failed. One final note: Burton talked about a budget deal in the middle of a conversation that dealt mainly with the debate over raising the debt ceiling. While the two issues are now linked, there is no evidence that there was ever a deal between Republicans and Democrats on allowing the government’s borrowing limit to rise. On the contrary, even as House Republican leaders were trying to sell their troops on a strategy to keep the government open, they said they wanted a showdown on the debt ceiling. Burton’s comment addressed only half of the current impasse. Our ruling Burton said Democrats had struck a deal to avert a shutdown with Republicans that Cantor considered a win, implying that Republicans were going back on previous agreements. Cantor’s legislative agenda memo from early September is in line with that and described the benefits of that approach. Cantor also attempted to keep that deal alive through a legislative maneuver until tea party members refused to go along.   As for whether Cantor called the plan ""a win,"" he didn’t use that word. But he did include it on a list that he said would result in ""significant policy victories."" Burton’s statement does not apply to the standoff over the debt ceiling, though, which was what he was asked about. On the other hand, it did speak to the broader challenge of negotiating successfully if the parties don’t speak for the block of votes they need to deliver. We rate the claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EB839700>],/factchecks/2013/oct/11/bill-burton/burton-says-rep-eric-cantor-called-deal-democrats-/
"['Environment', 'Agriculture', 'Oregon', 'Rick North']","
Do two state agriculture groups have ties to biotech firms?
","During the Oregon Legislature’s most recent special session, one bill stuck out as an oddity. Four of the five bills dealt solidly with fiscal policy -- taxes and the Public Employees Retirement System. The fifth, though, addressed whether local governments could regulate genetically modified crops. The bill was thrown in as something of a bargaining chip. Gov. John Kitzhaber needed Republican support for his other four endeavors, and the GMO bill was one way to reach a compromise. This deal, however, rubbed environmentalists the wrong way. They began calling the bill the ""Oregon Monsanto Protection Act."" One of the bill’s critics was Rick North, the former project director of the Oregon Physicians for Social Responsibility's Campaign For Safe Food. In a piece he wrote for BlueOregon, a liberal political blog, he called out two of the local -- and wholesome sounding -- groups that were big advocates of the legislation. ""Oregonians for Food and Shelter and the Oregon Farm Bureau, biotech puppets who have most state Republican legislators in their back pocket, jumped into action,"" he wrote. ""OFS proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech companies."" We were curious about the board member and funding claims, so we decided to take a look. The first bit, that Oregonians for Food and Shelter has board members from those two leading biotech firms was easy to check. We simply went to the group’s website and found, listed along with 34 other voting members, these two names: Michael Diamond, the director of government affairs for Monsanto, and Danelle Farmer, who was most recently listed as a senior state government relations manager at Syngenta. The names aren’t difficult to find -- and they’re listed along with their corporate affiliations. Naturally, we reached out to Oregonians for Food and Shelter to see if they had extra information we might consider. Scott Dahlman, the executive director, said it is unabashedly the group’s position to defend ""the right to responsibly use pesticides and biotechnology."" Next we checked out the Oregon Farm Bureau funding statement. We started by speaking with the bureau’s spokeswoman, Anne Marie Moss. She said it was probably true because the group has a political action committee that accepts donations from any and all groups. Moss stressed, however, that the Farm Bureau is a largely grassroots organization that takes positions based on what county members -- all of whom are required to be involved in agriculture or ranching -- vote to take up on the state level. ""We have members on both sides of that issue as well, but it's like a democracy,"" Moss said. ""Majority rules."" Generally, she said, the group tries to support all sorts of agriculture, whether organic or genetically modified, but often members come down on the side of fewer restrictions. ""We believe in the whole big tent of agriculture, all types are welcome,"" she said. There is already ""a lot of regulation so, as a whole, we try to push back. We don't want our members regulated out of business."" We took a look at the campaign finance records for ourselves and found that both Monsanto and Syngenta had contributed a significant sum to the group. Since 2006, the Oregon Farm Bureau has reported receiving about $440,000 in cash contributions. Of that, Monsanto has contributed $103,500 and Syngenta has given more than $19,000. That means those two companies represent a combined 28 percent of the total reported cash contributions. This year, Monsanto donated $10,500 -- $4,500 in mid-September. During our conversation, Moss noted that while the money is appreciated, ""Monsanto couldn't come in and give us a command directive."" Indeed, we found donations from other sources, including individual farms and nurseries. For our final stab at due diligence, we called North to let him know we’d looked into his claims. We asked him why he thought this information was important given that both groups consider themselves to be grassroots. ""I don't know that it's anything more complicated than ‘Follow the money,’"" he said. In an opinion piece for BlueOregon, North said Oregonians for Food and Shelter ""proudly features board members from Monsanto and Syngenta and the (Oregon) Farm Bureau also receives funding from biotech."" We’ve checked out both claims and found them to be accurate. We rate this statement True.

Cuccinelli says McAuliffe threatened to shut down state government over Medicaid
","Amid the partial shutdown of the federal government, Virginia’s major gubernatorial candidates have been trading jabs over which one is likely to bring Washington-style dysfunction to Richmond. At a recent debate, Democrat Terry McAuliffe said GOP rival Ken Cuccinelli ""tried to shut down"" Virginia government in 2008 by introducing an unsuccessful budget amendment in the state senate that would have defunded Planned Parenthood. We rated McAuliffe’s claim Pants on Fire. This time, we’ll examine a Cuccinelli charge -- made in a radio ad -- that it’s McAuliffe who’s gung-ho for government gridlock.   ""He’s already threatened to shut down Virginia’s government if his budget plan isn’t supported,"" the narrator says of McAuliffe. Anna Nix, a Cuccinelli campaign spokeswoman, told us the claim refers to McAuliffe’s repeated vow that he won’t sign a budget as governor unless it provides for Medicaid expansion. An additional 400,000 low-income Virginians would be eligible for the health care program next year under an Obamacare offering.  In the first three years the federal government would pay 100 percent of the new cost. After that, the share gradually declines to 90 percent, with the state paying the rest. Virginia lawmakers have not decided whether to expand the state’s program, instead opting for a commission that will recommend efficiencies to Medicaid before a final choice is made. McAuliffe says the state would be foolish to turn down the federal money. Cuccinelli and many Republican legislators oppose expanding Medicaid, saying Washington can’t be trusted over the long term to pay its promised share. Cuccinelli’s spokeswoman noted that McAuliffe said in a June 1 dinner speech to Loudoun County Democrats, ""No budget gets done unless the governor signs that legislation. I will not sign a budget in Virginia unless the Medicaid expansion is included. "" McAuliffe was quoted by the AARP on Aug. 29 saying he wouldn’t sign budget that doesn’t fund Medicaid expansion. During a Sept. 7 speech in Arlington, McAuliffe said, ""My opponent doesn’t support the Medicaid expansion. I have asked the legislators `Please do not send me a bill’ -- because the governor has to sign the bill for the budget to come into effect -- ‘please don’t send me a bill unless the Medicaid expansion is included.’"" Growing the program would certainly run into stiff opposition from Republicans in the General Assembly. But is McAuliffe’s pledge not to sign a budget that excludes Medicaid expansion tantamount to a threat to shut down government? Let’s dig deeper. If a governor does not sign a budget bill that has been passed by the General Assembly, it automatically becomes law, according to A.E. Dick Howard, a University of Virginia law professor who helped draft a revised state constitution that voters adopted in 1971. Howard pointed to Article 5, Section 6 of the state constitution, which says if the governor receives a bill while the General Assembly is in session, he has seven days to sign, amend or veto the legislation, or it becomes law. If the governor receives a bill when the General Assembly is not in session, he has 30 days to act before the measure becomes law. Any budget amendments offered by a governor can be defeated by a majority vote in either chamber. Should the governor veto a budget, the legislature can override it with a two-thirds vote of each house. McAuliffe says his budget-signing vow will never come into play if he becomes governor because he’s certain he could convince a majority of legislators to approve Medicaid expansion. ""No budget will be shut down in Virginia over the Medicaid expansion,"" McAuliffe said during a Sept. 25 debate with Cuccinelli. ""I will work in a bipartisan way to get it done…so we won’t have any government shutdown."" Our ruling Cuccinelli says McAuliffe has threatened to shut down state government. He points to McAuliffe’s repeated promise not to sign a state budget that does not allow for Medicaid expansion. But McAuliffe’s vow, if carried out, would not close Virginia’s government. If a governor does not sign the budget, it automatically becomes law no more than 30 days after the General Assembly sent it to his desk. It’s striking that Cuccinelli, who has served almost four years as attorney general after an eight-year career in the state Senate, overlooked this constitutional provision. We rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC709E00>],/factchecks/2013/oct/11/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-threatened-shut-down-sta/
