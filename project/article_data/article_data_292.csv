Florida Dems say Romney supported law that could have banned some kinds of birth control
","In an effort to sway women voters, Democrats keep returning to the theme of abortion rights. They’ve run ad after ad linking Mitt Romney to some of the most extreme positions, such as banning all abortions -- even in cases of rape and incest.

A recent mailing from the Florida Democratic Party broadens the attack by claiming that ""Romney supported a law that could have made most common forms of birth control illegal.""

We have looked at several claims about Romney and abortion, but contraception has received less attention. We gave a True rating to the claim that he supports allowing employers to exclude contraceptive coverage from the health plans they offer their workers. This is the first time we have explored the question of whether Romney backed a law that would have blocked access to some contraceptive methods altogether.

The Florida Democratic Party’s argument runs like this: Romney believes that life begins at conception; that is the starting point for legal efforts to define a fertilized egg as a person; ""personhood"" laws would treat some forms of contraception as murder, so those would be illegal; therefore, Romney supports restrictions on contraceptives. We’ll walk through those steps.

The Florida Democrats pointed to the many times that Romney has said he believes life begins at conception.  He said it at a town hall event in Iowa in 2011 and on his campaign website. In an interview on Fox Television with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Romney said he would ""absolutely"" support a constitutional amendment that defined life as beginning at conception.

The Democrats also cited a PolitiFact article that found it Mostly True that Romney supports overturning Roe vs. Wade and an amendment on life beginning at conception.

But now we get to the most tenuous link in the Democrats’ argument. Laws that say conception gives rise to life are not the same as ones that say conception creates a person.

""Saying ‘life’ begins at fertilization is quite different from saying ‘personhood’ does,"" said Glenn Cohen, a specialist in legal bioethics at Harvard Law School. ""No one denies that fetuses or embryos are alive, but many dispute that they are persons.""

The legal difference is huge.

Christopher Tollefsen, a philosophy professor at the University of South Carolina, explained that ""to say that something is a ‘person’ is to say that it has a particular kind of moral status -- the sort of thing you can't kill and that deserves the protection of the law.""

The 2011 Mississippi Personhood initiative is a good example. Amendment 26 stated that ""the term 'person' or 'persons' shall include every human being from the moment of fertilization."" Had it passed, Amendment 26 would not only have led to a ban on most abortions, its effect would likely have gone further. Since it takes about eight or more days for a fertilized egg to implant in the wall of the uterus and there are birth control methods that prevent implantation, then such a law might well have made those methods illegal.

But Romney never supported the Mississippi measure or others like it. He and his campaign carefully avoided endorsing Amendment 26 without actually saying so. After the interview with Huckabee, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams was asked if Romney stood behind the initiative.

Romney was ""supportive of efforts to recognize life begins at conception,"" Williams said. Neither Williams nor Romney ever said ""personhood.""

When personhood organizers asked Romney to participate in candidate forums, he declined.

He's also been clear about his support for contraception.

During the second presidential debate, Obama accused Romney of failing to stand up for women. Obama said Romney would allow employers to exclude birth control coverage from their health plans, an accurate account of Romney's position.

Romney's reply was something of a non-sequitur. Rather than explain that position, he addressed a different point -- whether the government or employers would prohibit the use of contraception, which is not what Obama was suggesting.

""I don't believe that bureaucrats in Washington should tell someone whether they can use contraceptives or not, and I don't believe employers should tell someone whether they could have contraceptive care or not,"" Romney said. ""Every woman in America should have access to contraceptives.""

Romney’s campaign then produced an ad that featured a young mother researching Romney’s position on birth control and abortion and then seeing a PolitiFact fact-check on abortion. ""Turns out,"" she said, ""Romney doesn’t oppose contraception at all.""

Romney has argued that since contraceptives prevent fertilization, they never conflict with laws that say life begins at conception. For the most part, this is accurate. According to the Centers for Disease Control, the most common forms of birth control are the pill, (used by 17 percent of women), sterilization (16 percent) and condoms (10 percent). However, a less common form, the intrauterine device or IUD, that is used by about 3 percent of women, is thought to sometimes avoid pregnancy by preventing the implantation of a fertilized egg in the wall of the uterus.

Thus, Romney’s argument might not be as simple as he presents. But again, defining life as beginning at conception has not interfered with birth control. Prior to and during part of Romney’s time as governor, Massachusetts law said life began at fertilization. That did not lead to statewide prohibitions on birth control.

Our ruling

The mailer from the Florida Democratic Party says Romney supported a law that could have made most common forms of birth control illegal.

Romney supports laws that define life as beginning at conception, but we have not found that these laws bar the use of contraceptives -- at least, certainly not the most common forms. Personhood laws could limit some forms of birth control, but Romney has not supported those measures. And Romney has repeatedly said he supports the use of contraceptives.

Betty Sutton claims Jim Renacci consistently supported loopholes that encourage outsourcing
","
From President Barack Obama on down to congressional candidates, Democrats this election season are decrying tax loopholes they say benefit companies that move jobs overseas.

They cast themselves as protectors of the worker and Republicans as enablers of outsourcing.

Of course in politics it’s never quite so simple. Take U.S. Rep. Betty Sutton.

The Democrat from Copley Township faces U.S. Rep. Jim Renacci, a Republican from Wadsworth, in one of only two battles of House incumbents this November. They are fighting for Ohio’s 16th District, which encompasses parts of western Cuyahoga County and parts of five other counties to the south.

At a debate Oct. 10, 2012, at the City Club of Cleveland, Sutton moved quickly to tag Renacci with the outsourcer label.

Asked about the role of government in creating jobs, Sutton talked of sponsoring legislation to promote the use of U.S. goods in infrastructure projects. Then she shifted into attack mode.

""We can also close those loopholes that my opponent has consistently voted for that encourage outsourcing of our jobs and stop ... continuing to support bad trade deals, as my opponent has voted for three bad trade deals that are not going to serve Ohio well in the future,"" she said.

Renacci took exception to the loophole part of the claim.

""I’d love for her to tell me one of those loopholes she’s talking about,"" he said a minute later after answering another question from moderator Mike McIntyre of The Plain Dealer. ""I don’t know what those deductions are to send jobs overseas, those loopholes. I’d love to hear it someday.""

PolitiFact Ohio was curious, too.

By way of background, corporate tax rates overseas are typically lower than those in the United States. U.S.-based multinational companies must also pay domestic taxes on foreign profits, but not until they return -- or repatriate -- those earnings to their home country. And many companies, through keen accounting and reinvestment abroad, make sure that never happens.

The practice is known as deferral. We found a good primer on this subject posted by Howard Gleckman, editor of TaxVox, a blog from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center.

Let’s also quickly address terminology.

A recent item from our colleagues at PolitiFact Wisconsin was helpful here. They note that, as defined by the National Academy of Public Administration, outsourcing is the contracting out of services domestically or internationally. When a company shifts ""service and manufacturing activities abroad to unaffiliated firms or their own affiliates,"" that’s called off shoring. What Sutton described seems to fit more under the off shoring, but ""outsourcing"" is recognized as a catch-all.

With that out of the way, let’s examine Renacci’s record.

As Exhibit A, Sutton campaign spokesman Anthony DeAngelo offered the Republican budget proposal from U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, whom GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney has tapped as his running mate. Ryan’s budget sought in part to move toward what’s known as a territorial tax system. Such a system would lift U.S. taxes on foreign profits, meaning that a multinational corporation would not have to pay taxes on overseas earnings it repatriates.

Renacci voted in favor of the Republican budget and against the Democratic alternative, offered as an amendment to Ryan’s proposal. The Democratic plan failed in the Republican-controlled House. Ryan’s budget was later blocked in the Democratic-controlled Senate.

DeAngelo also pointed to Renacci’s vote in favor of the Simpler, Fairer Tax Code Act of 2012. This also would have moved the U.S. toward territorial taxation. The bill passed the House in August on a largely party-line vote but has not been taken up by the Senate.

Proponents of territorial taxation, including Renacci, argue that it would level the playing field with other countries and encourage repatriation. Opponents worry that the system will make it even more enticing for U.S. companies to move jobs overseas. Gleckman legitimized these fears, noting that ""such a shift might encourage some domestic companies to move more of their operations -- and shift both jobs and more reported income -- to low tax countries.""

PolitiFact Wisconsin weighed in on a similar claim by AFSCME. The large public-employees union said in a television ad that U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson ""supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs.""

AFSCME pointed to Thompson’s stated support of the Ryan budget as back-up. PolitiFact Wisconsin rated the statement Half True, stressing the following points: 
Renacci has proposed a plan similar to Thompson’s. But before we get to that, let’s first let’s look at other votes the Sutton campaign cites in defense of the congresswoman’s claim.

In September 2011, Renacci supported the Protecting Jobs from Government Interference Act. The bill, according to the New York Times, stemmed from the National Labor Relations Board’s efforts to block Boeing from opening a South Carolina plant. Republicans produced legislation that would have prevented the board from taking such action. Democrats called it the ""Outsourcers Bill of Rights"" and argued it would make it easier to shift jobs overseas.

And in April, Renacci voted against a package of Democratic amendments to the Small Business Tax Cut Act. One amendment sought to ban tax deductions for companies that have more jobs overseas than in the U.S. This ""motion to recommit"" failed on a near party-line vote.

DeAngelo cited other votes, but some were procedural -- not an up or down vote on an actual bill -- and others didn’t directly address the off-shoring issue Sutton raised at the City Club debate. PolitiFact Ohio found the Ryan budget, the Fairer Tax Code Act, the labor bill and the package of amendments to be the most relevant when evaluating Sutton’s statement at the City Club.

As a side note, we have noted before that legislators often face the dilemma of having to vote against programs they would normally support because they are so opposed to other provisions in the same piece of legislation.

Finally, it’s important to consider a piece of information that even DeAngelo acknowledged: Renacci last November introduced the Returning Investment to America Act. The proposal, backed by two Democratic co-sponsors, aims to incentivize the repatriation of profits made by U.S. companies overseas.

Renacci’s bill would relax taxes on these earnings when companies bring them back to the U.S. -- if the companies pour the money into expanded domestic operations or payroll.

""American companies have roughly $1.4 trillion in foreign earnings sitting overseas, not being invested in the U.S. economy,"" one of the Democratic co-sponsors, U.S. Rep. John Carney of Delaware, said for Renacci’s news release. ""With high unemployment and a struggling economy, this bipartisan legislation incentivizes companies to bring that money back to the U.S. to reinvest and hire new workers. There are strict mechanisms in place to ensure that only money being used to increase payroll or purchase new assets is eligible for the lower tax rate.""

In other words, the bill would do the opposite of what Sutton has accused Renacci of supporting.

The legislation was sent to the House Ways & Means Committee but never made it to a vote.

So where does this leave the congresswoman’s statement?

Sutton said that Renacci ""consistently voted"" for loopholes that ""encourage outsourcing of our jobs.""

The claim is partially accurate, but Sutton’s leaves out important details that would provide key context. Yes, Renacci supports territorial taxation. But researchers are divided on the net effect this would have on U.S. jobs.

And Renacci has demonstrated an interest in incentivizing repatriation, introducing legislation of his own legislation toward that end in 2011.

This clashes with Sutton’s characterization that he consistently encourages outsourcing.

On the Truth-O-Meter, the claim rates Half True.",/factchecks/2012/nov/02/betty-sutton/betty-sutton-claims-jim-renacci-consistently-suppo/
"['Rhode Island', 'Health Care', 'Medicare', 'Sheldon Whitehouse']","
U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse says budget proposed by vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan would eliminate Medicare in 10 years
","
PolitiFact's 2011 Lie of the Year was the claim by Democrats that ""Republicans voted to end Medicare.""

Since then, Democrats have been using variants of that theme, such as saying Republicans want to ""end Medicare as we know it,"" to alert voters -- particularly elderly voters -- about GOP proposals to change the program that provides health care to people 65 and older.

During his Oct. 23, 2012 WPRI-Providence Journal debate with Republican challenger Barry Hinckley, U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, a Democrat, picked up on that theme, talking about the changes in Medicare proposed by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, now the GOP’s vice presidential candidate.

""The Ryan budget gets rid of Medicare in 10 years and turns it into a voucher program,"" Whitehouse said.

PolitiFact National has covered this ground before including looking at statements such as ones by Vice President Joe Biden that ""there's not one Democrat who endorses"" the Romney-Ryan Medicare plan -- rated True -- and that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan would ""eliminate the guarantee of Medicare""  -- rated Half True. We'll summarize the issues here.

The bad news on Medicare is the money is running out. For example, according to the program’s actuary, the trust fund that pays for hospital care will run dry in 2024 -- even sooner if President Obama’s health care law is repealed, eliminating the cost-saving cuts that go along with it.

In early 2011, Ryan, the Republican House budget chairman, released a budget blueprint (not an actual budget) calling for the conversion of Medicare into a voucher system, meaning enrollees would get a set amount of money to buy a health insurance plan of their choice. Republicans call it ""premium support.""

But it also called for keeping Medicare intact for people 55 or older. In addition, to save money, the plan would have raised the eligibility age from 65 to 67. It passed the House on April 15, 2011. The Democrat-controlled Senate rejected it a month later.
   
That sparked the ""end Medicare"" meme, even though supporters of the Ryan plan noted that the change would only affect people 54 and younger.

The next incarnation came when Ryan and U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., developed a white paper that offered a compromise. It would offer Medicare to anyone who wanted it in the future, combined with a voucher-like system to allow people to buy a competitive private policy if they preferred. To quote the white paper: ""Traditional Medicare will always be offered as a viable and robust choice.""

After Ryan released his budget proposal for 2013, which included the compromise, Wyden said he was no longer in favor of the plan because it had been combined with other elements, such as the repeal of Obamacare and no protections for Medicaid recipients.

But one theme has been consistent among recent  Republican proposals to change Medicare: although younger Americans would essentially have a choice between traditional Medicare and some other form of retirement-age health insurance option -- the current program would be retained for people 55 and older.

When we asked the Whitehouse campaign about the senator's statement, spokesman Tony Simon said the senator was correct because, if the Ryan budget had passed, that would be ""ending Medicare as we know it and turning it into a voucher.""

But Whitehouse didn't say ""end Medicare as we know it.""

He said Medicare would be gone in 10 years. Under the latest version of the Ryan plan, it wouldn’t.

We rate Whitehouse's statement False.

Connie Mack says Bill Nelson voted for higher taxes 272 times
","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV, R-Fort Myers, has repeatedly said that his Senate opponent, Democrat Bill Nelson, voted to raise taxes 150 times.

In the home stretch, Mack has now upped the ante in an Oct. 26 fundraising email. The subject line: ""We were Wrong.""

""For months you've heard us say that Bill Nelson has voted in favor of higher taxes over 150 times. As it turns out, we were wrong,"" the email says. "" I hope you'll forgive our mistake. In fact, it turns out Bill Nelson actually voted in favor of higher taxes 272 times. That's right -- Bill Nelson didn't vote for higher taxes over 150 times. He did it 272 times.""

Mack’s fundraising plea explains that its initial claim included about 157 votes Nelson cast in the Senate starting in 2001. Now the Mack campaign has gone back decades to cite votes that Nelson took while in the Florida House of Representatives (1973-78) and in the U.S. House of Representatives (1979-90).

In this fact-check we will explore if Nelson voted for higher taxes 272 times. The Mack campaign sent us a memo showing their list of about 150 tax votes in the Senate, and they also show Nelson’s older votes on their website. We specifically examined the votes that the Mack campaign identified as the most significant while Nelson was in the U.S. House.

Budget resolutions

In August, we fact-checked Mack’s claim that Nelson ""voted to raise our taxes 150 times"" and ruled that claim False. We will recap our research from that item and update our analysis, including addressing new arguments made to us by the Mack campaign. (Read our original fact-check.)

About half of the votes on that earlier 150-vote list were Democratic budget resolutions, which set non-binding parameters for considering tax and spending legislation. So it's technically incorrect to say the budget resolution will raise, lower or even keep taxes the same. The documents cannot change tax law.

Mack researcher Gary Maloney said that these resolutions should count as Nelson votes for higher taxes because they are instructions to committees about what bills to pass concerning spending and taxes. He pointed to a Congressional Research Service article that explains that a budget resolution is an agreement between the House and Senate about the federal budget, and that legislation must be consistent with resolutions.

""After Congress works a change in taxes or spending into a budget resolution, the next step is
to pass bills that conform tax and spending laws to enforce the budget,"" he said. ""Each budget assumes set amounts of spending and revenue in a given year.""

We sent Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a copy of our earlier fact-check and our disputes with Mack whether to count budget resolutions as votes for higher taxes. Ellis told us that the budget resolution issue is tricky.

""It is relatively non-binding as you indicate,"" Ellis said in an email. ""Especially if there is no final concurrent budget resolution. The only time it becomes binding is if they do budget reconciliation, which is how the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts got through the Senate. That forces the committee’s hands.""

Duplicative counting

Mack’s tally counts multiple votes on the same budget resolution. For example, Mack cites nine votes Nelson took in 2008 about Congressional Resolution 70, a five-year budget plan.

Mack also counted multiple votes on actual legislation. It’s common for senators to take multiple votes as both parties engage in maneuvering and introduce competing amendments.

For example, in 2001 Mack counts 15 of Nelson’s votes on H.R. 1836 -- the $1.35 trillion in tax cuts enacted under President George W. Bush. In our view, that counts as one example of Nelson opposing tax cuts -- not 15 examples.

The Mack campaign argues that duplicative votes should count because there can be differences in various versions of the same bill, and Nelson could have chosen to change his vote along the way. Maloney said that Mack’s claim was about the number of ""votes"" -- not about the number of ""bills.""

We also asked Ellis to weigh in on Mack’s argument about duplicative votes.

""Counting multiple votes on the same legislation and all of its permutations just serves to pad the number, but in some cases isn’t completely inaccurate, just not telling the full tale,"" Ellis said.

Defining ""higher taxes""

Which brings us to another point: Is opposing a tax cut the same as ""voting to raise our taxes?"" as Mack initially said, or, as he says now, ""higher taxes""?

This note by the Mack campaign about Nelson’s U.S. Senate votes explains how the campaign defined higher taxes: ""The votes in this tally are votes against tax cuts as well as votes to raise taxes, votes in favor of reducing proposed tax cuts, votes for non-binding resolutions supporting taxes, votes to eliminate particular tax cut provisions while retaining others, etc. Because of this, the language must be votes ‘in favor of higher taxes’ to be accurate. Be aware that in certain instances in the votes below, a majority of Republicans voted the way Nelson did. Please also be aware that these votes cannot be characterized in a way that implies that each one would have resulted in a tax increase; this would be inaccurate.""

Nelson campaign spokesman Dan McLaughlin, who said that Mack used ""twisted math,"" pointed to the last sentence in that note that said that the votes can’t be characterized as a tax increase.

Mack’s original list counted several examples of Nelson opposing tax cuts. Some are minor, such as Nelson’s vote to table an amendment to get rid of the medical device tax in 2010.

Earlier this year, we sent Mack’s list to a number of experts, including Joshua Gordon, policy director of the Concord Coalition, a group that urges deficit reduction.

Gordon called Mack’s list ""ludicrous.""

""Voting to lessen the size of a tax cut in a budget resolution is not voting for a tax increase,"" he said. ""So, I would argue the methodology represents a crazy way to look at this issue.""

The Mack campaign now argues that a vote against a tax cut is a vote on the side of ""higher taxes."" For the 272-vote claim, the Mack campaign includes a Nelson vote in the Florida House that maintained the gas tax in 1977. So that legislation kept the status quo -- and the Mack campaign argues that is a vote for ""higher taxes"" because if he had wanted to get rid of the tax that would be ""lower taxes.""

Again, we turned to Ellis:

""That’s fairly clever,"" Ellis wrote. ""Although I guess you could argue that any vote to not cut taxes is a vote for higher taxes, or to not cut them further – regardless of whether it’s a tax vote or not. It’s kind of a slippery slope. So it would be more accurate to say maintain taxes rather than for higher taxes which leaves the listener/reader with an impression that isn’t accurate.

Mack’s statement also omits that Nelson has sometimes voted in favor of tax cuts. In 2006 and in 2010, for example, Nelson supported extending tax cuts.

This year, he went along with Obama’s plan and voted in July to keep tax cuts only for those earning less than $250,000, though he had said he would have preferred keeping the Bush-era tax cuts for those earning up to $1 million.

Mack’s new claim includes Nelson’s votes in the Florida House and the U.S. House of Representatives

To get to its new number of 272, the Mack campaign now includes Nelson’s votes from 1973 to 1978 in the Florida state House.

That list also includes some duplication: for example, there are two votes listed on the same cigarette tax bill in 1973.

Some tax votes only applied to a portion of the state’s taxpayers -- for example, one related to a taxing district in the city of Boca Raton.

Many of the votes were about fees, and some were obscure or only applied to a slice of residents: registration fees for barbers’ assistants, a fee for golf courses to set up temporary bars, and prestige tags for motorcyclists.

Other fees had a bigger effect, such as a 1975 measure which was expected to raise $500,000 in driver’s license fees.

The Mack campaign also searched the federal congressional record to obtain information on Nelson’s votes as a congressman and lists about 89 as votes for higher taxes.

Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin noted that about 18 of the U.S. House votes cited by Mack were non-binding resolutions. Also, the Mack campaign includes about 38 duplicative votes, in cases when Nelson took between two and six votes on the same bill.

The Mack campaign cited several key House votes of Nelson in favor of higher taxes. These included the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, the Deficit Reduction Act of 1984 and a significant tax increase in 1990. We confirmed that Nelson did vote in favor of these taxes. An interesting historical note, however, is that Republican presidents Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush signed them into law.

Our ruling

Mack said that ""Bill Nelson actually voted in favor of higher taxes 272 times.""

After PolitiFact gave Mack a ""False"" rating for saying that Nelson voted to raise taxes 150 times the Mack campaign has tweaked their message to say Nelson voted in favor of ""higher taxes."" Mack argues that ""higher"" taxes aren’t necessarily the same as a tax ""increase"" -- a vote for the status quo or against a tax cut is choosing a path of ""higher"" taxes, Mack argues.

We find that Mack’s new wording could still leave voters with a false impression.

Nelson did take some votes that raised taxes. But Mack grossly inflates the number by counting multiple votes on the same bill, non-binding resolutions and some fees that only affected a slice of the population.

Senate hopeful Tommy Thompson made millions from outsourcers, pro-Democratic group says
","
Attacking Tommy Thompson as being ""not for you anymore,"" Democratic U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin casts Thompson as someone who has profited from big corporations and who would favor them if he is elected to the U.S. Senate.

Majority PAC, a political action committee that aims to protect the Democratic majority in the Senate, portrays the Republican former governor in much the same way. In a TV ad released Oct. 31, 2012, Majority PAC states:

""Tommy Thompson made millions from corporations who outsource American jobs and now he's trying to lavish huge tax breaks on them.""

The claim has two distinct parts.

‘Made millions’ from outsourcers

There’s no disputing that Thompson has made millions of dollars since departing his post as U.S. health and human services secretary under President George W. Bush, a job he held after leaving the Wisconsin governor’s office. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported in January 2012 that Thompson’s assets exceeded $13 million, most it from his work as a corporate consultant, executive, investor and speaker after leaving Bush’s cabinet in 2005.

But the Majority PAC’s claim is that he was paid millions specifically by corporations that moved jobs out of the United States. When we asked the group for backup, it provided a document that cited three corporations.

C.R. Bard: Filings from the federal Securities and Exchange Commission show C.R. Bard, a New Jersey medical device firm, has paid Thompson some $1.5 million in cash and stock options since 2005, when he became a board member.

Majority PAC also cited a report by the federal Office of Trade Adjustment Assistance, which investigated a February 2011 complaint filed by a New York state agency on behalf of Bard workers. The report said a significant number of Bard workers lost their jobs because the company shifted some production to Mexico. In December 2011, Bard announced it was cutting 50 New York jobs, some of which could be relocated outside of the U.S., according to a news article that noted that Bard a year earlier had announced 200 job cuts.

In its own attack on Thompson, another group, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, noted that Bard’s 2011 annual report said that ""over the past three years, we’ve added close to 300 people in emerging markets in South America, Europe and Asia.""

Deloitte: Thompson earned more than $1 million in consulting fees from the accounting firm, according a 2007 disclosure report he filed with the government.

Majority PAC cited statements by Deloitte, including one on the company's website, which say Deloitte offers its clients outsourcing advisory services.

But obviously that’s not the same as directly outsourcing jobs.

Unisys: Thompson’s 2007 disclosure report said he received $5,000 from Harvard Consulting for serving on the Unisys Global Public Sector Advisory Board.

An advisory role is certainly less powerful, and far less lucrative, than Thompson’s role as a Bard board member, although Unisys was involved in outsourcing.

Majority PAC cited an April 2007 news story that reported that Unisys, an information technology company, planned to lay off 950 employees, mainly in the U.S. and in the United Kingdom, while it beefed up operations in cheaper markets such as India, China and Eastern Europe. The company hired about 1,200 workers in those regions, primarily India, in 2006, a company spokesman said in the article.

So, while the first part of the claim suggested Thompson earned multi-millions working for a number of corporations that outsourced jobs, the group’s evidence shows something less than that.

Thompson earned $1.5 million -- virtually all of it from one company -- that sent jobs outside the U.S.

'Lavishing huge tax breaks'

The second part of Majority PAC's claim is that Thompson wants to give huge tax breaks to corporations that outsource.

We've already rated as Half True a nearly identical statement by the AFSCME public employees union, which said in September 2012 that Thompson ""supports massive tax cuts for corporations that outsource Wisconsin jobs.""

We found Thompson would completely exempt from taxation U.S. companies’ profits from overseas operations, under certain conditions.

But researchers differed on whether U.S. employment would decline under this ""territorial"" tax approach, with some arguing that businesses would invest more at home as a result of the tax break. And part of Thompson’s plan provides incentives that could convince companies to bring profits back home.

Thompson’s campaign didn’t reply to a request to respond to the Majority PAC ad.

But for a Journal Sentinel story about troubles encountered by companies Thompson oversaw, his campaign spokeswoman said: ""It is important to note that as a board member, Governor Thompson is not involved in the daily operations of these companies. Rather, his role, among other things, is to provide a strategic vision to these companies similar to the roles of other directors and officers.""

Our rating

Majority PAC said Thompson ""made millions from corporations who outsource American jobs and now he's trying to lavish huge tax breaks on them.""

Thompson was paid $1.5 million, but that doesn’t match the ""millions"" claimed in the ad. He supports a tax break for U.S. companies' profits from overseas, but it's possible the tax break could lead to more American jobs.

"['Space', 'Voting Record', 'Florida', 'Bill Nelson']","
Bill Nelson says Connie Mack voted against NASA bill
","
As Florida’s U.S. Senate debate came to a close, sitting Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson glanced at his notes, gestured to his opponent and lobbed a final missile.

""We have a great pride in this state in our space program,"" Nelson began, turning toward Republican Challenger U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV. ""My opponent is the only member of the Florida delegation that voted against a bill to help NASA.""

Mack was so busy fending off other Nelson attacks during that Oct. 17 debate, he didn’t respond to the accusation about the NASA bill.

That’s why we decided to launch a probe (sorry!) into this claim.

Nelson was referring to the NASA Authorization Act of 2010, a sweeping compromise of a bill that authorized a drastic change of direction for the space program.

Among other things, the $58 billion law, which Nelson helped pass, directs NASA to contract out low-earth orbit to private vendors so the government can work toward going to Mars and establishing a permanent human presence in space. The law also directs NASA to restart its technology development program and, when possible, work with international partners.

A review of the congressional voting records show Mack voted against the bill, and he was the only Florida representative to do so.

That part of Nelson’s claim is solid.

But Nelson’s statement also implies that a vote against the NASA bill is a vote against the space program. And that’s where we see some nuance.

S. 3729 was the subject of fierce arguments about the direction of the space program. And former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, whose husband is an astronaut, was among those who opposed it.

Mack has supported several other NASA bills, but opposed this one because of concerns with spending and the direction of the program, Mack consultant Gary Maloney said.

""Connie Mack joined Gabrielle Giffords and others in opposing Barack Obama's attempt to restructure NASA, essentially building a $35 billion 'rocket to nowhere,' "" said Maloney, referring to the powerful ""heavy-lift rocket"" that sets the stage for visiting asteroids and Mars. ""Bill Nelson supported Obama's plan with no defined mission or destination for NASA going forward.""

Scott Pace, director of the Space Policy Institute at George Washington University, said Obama put forth the original plan for the direction of NASA, which Congress rejected. But the Senate used that foundation to craft its own plan, which squeezed past both chambers.

""Some House members were okay with it, some weren't for a variety of reasons,"" Pace said.

NASA publicly supported the bill. And, after it passed, NASA administrator Charles Bolden showered it with praise in the blog for The Hill, a congressional newspaper.

""The plan invests more in NASA, preserves the life of the International Space Station, launches a commercial space transportation industry, fosters the development of path-breaking technologies, and helps create thousands of new jobs,"" Bolden wrote.

The law also helps secure a bright future for Kennedy Space Center at Cape Canaveral, which is working with private contractor company SpaceX to launch rockets, said NASA spokesman David Weaver.

""This was the compromise plan for moving space exploration forward in America,"" he said.

Our ruling

Nelson claims Mack opposed a bill to help NASA.

And it’s true that Mack was the only member of the Florida delegation to vote against the NASA Authorization Act of 2010.  

But there’s a sprinkle of nuance we just can’t ignore.

While NASA supported the bill as a new and exciting path forward, many members of Congress had concerns about whether it charted the right path for the space program.

Even space policy experts agree that a vote against that legislation isn’t necessarily a vote against the space program.

Testing Thompson's position on Ryan's Medicare reform plan
","
In the homestretch of the U.S. Senate race, Republican Tommy Thompson offered a plan to slow rising Medicare costs that threaten the solvency of the government-run health insurance program for seniors.

The ""Tommy Thompson plan,"" as he called it, would give future seniors the option of staying in the program or joining one of the private health plans offered to federal employees.

The campaign of his opponent Democrat Tammy Baldwin cried foul, saying Thompson was ""trying to run away from"" his firm embrace of U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan’s controversial plan to reform Medicare.

Another case for the Flip-O-Meter, which tests whether candidates have changed their position. As usual, we’re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch, just whether the candidate has been consistent.

In the 2012 race, Thompson has ripped Baldwin for failing to propose a solvency plan for Medicare. Baldwin, in turn, has tried at every turn to link the former governor to Ryan’s plan, which critics paint as ""ending Medicare as we know it.""

Ryan’s  ""Path to Prosperity"" budget resolution in 2012 -- the latest in a series of similar fiscal plans he’s released in recent years -- included proposed changes in tax policy and entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid.

Ryan’s plan, which is nearly identical to Mitt Romney’s, allows beneficiaries under 55 a choice. They can use their payment to buy private insurance or for a plan that acts like traditional Medicare.

Critics call this a ""voucher"" plan that could leave seniors dipping deeper into their own pockets, while Ryan says it’s a ""premium support"" plan that will lower health care costs.

Let’s look at Thompson’s statements and actions:

October 2011: Thompson, already an unofficial Senate candidate, says an earlier version of Ryan’s budget plan, this one in 2011, was ""on the right track"". But unlike Ryan in that earlier plan, Thompson makes clear he wanted to give people under 55 a choice of staying on traditional Medicare or not when they reached retirement age. Thompson did not have a formal plan at the time.

Thompson says those who chose the traditional system would pay higher-out-of-pocket costs than seniors pay now because the system ""is going broke.""  

March 29, 2012: The House approves Ryan’s budget plan on a 228-191 partisan vote. The plan’s Medicare proposal -- modified from Ryan’s earlier plan -- offered the choice of using a government payment for private insurance or for a plan akin to traditional Medicare.

May 11-13, 2012: At the Republican Party state convention, Thompson endorses Ryan’s 2013 budget plan as a whole. The plan included the Medicare changes, allowing beneficiaries a choice. ""I will pass Paul Ryan’s budget plan in the U.S. Senate,"" he says. ""It is the right plan, at the right time, for America.""

On the ""deficit reduction"" section of his campaign website, Thompson says he ""fully and wholeheartedly endorses Paul Ryan’s Path to Prosperity and will take all necessary steps to ensure the U.S. Senate takes up the plan.  

""It makes Social Security solvent, preserves Medicare for our most needy seniors, maintains a safety net for the poor and provides for sufficient defense to protect our security,"" Thompson says on the site. It adds: the plan ""emanates from Wisconsin and the values we hold dear.""

Thompson, the site says, would have ""additional entitlement, tax and budget reforms to add to Paul Ryan’s plan"" during the campaign.

August 13, 2012: A Thompson radio ad after Ryan’s selection as Romney’ vice presidential nominee says Thompson would be the 51st vote to pass Ryan’s 2013 budget plan.

August 14, 2012: Thompson wins a four-way GOP primary election.

Sept. 28, 2012: During his first debate with Baldwin, Thompson briefly mentions a new wrinkle: People who opt not to stay in Medicare would be put in the health plan that federal employees, including members of Congress, are in.

""If it’s good enough for the Congress, why isn’t it good enough for the seniors,"" Thompson asked.

Oct. 5, 2012: Appearing at the Milwaukee Press Club Newsmaker luncheon, Thompson
pointedly says his Medicare plan now is ""different than Ryan’s,"" again noting the federal employee plan option. Thompson says his plan would make the changes for those under 55 in 2020. The timeline in Ryan’s plan is under 55 in 2023.

Oct. 19, 2012: Thompson told the Wisconsin State Journal editorial board of his new plan:
""This is a plan by Paul Ryan. I’ve modified it. I think my plan is better.""

Oct. 23, 2012: The Journal Sentinel, in a story entitled, ""How Thompson, Baldwin differ on Medicare,"" writes that Thompson for months touted a plan that would allow people a decade from now to remain in the current program or receive a subsidy from the government to buy health insurance from the private sector. ""In recent weeks, he has modified his course by saying he wants to allow people to stay in Medicare or sign up for the private healthcare plans offered to federal employees,"" the story said.

Oct. 26, 2012: In the final Senate debate, Thompson again outlines his plan, changing a detail: those under 50 in the year 2020 would get the choice. Thompson said Democrats’ plan was to ""play our harp while Rome burns and see Medicare collapse,"" while Baldwin said the federal health care law she backed had improved Medicare’s fiscal outlook.

Our rating

Thompson has praised Ryan’s various Medicare plans since 2011, and for much of the  2012 campaign indicated he fully embraced Ryan’s latest plan.

In the last month or so he’s partially changed his approach on Medicare reform, while edging away from Ryan. Really, though, he has only tweaked Ryan’s Medicare plan, and has not renounced Ryan’s budget blueprint -- Thompson still endorses it on his website.

"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Taxpayer Association of Oregon']","
Did Sen. Mark Hass raise taxes by $1 billion in a single day?
","
Sometimes elections can start to feel a little like a song on repeat: Same candidates, same issues, same talking points -- over and over again.

That’s the case with a legislative attack we first saw in 2010 that claimed Senate Majority Leader Richard Devlin, D-Tualatin, had raised ""your taxes by $1 billion in a single day."" Back then, we called the claim Half True.

Well, the attack is back this year -- only this time we found the mailer from the Taxpayer Association of Oregon targeting Mark Hass, a Beaverton Democrat. (The Senate Democrats’ campaign arm says it’s also being used against Sen. Laurie Monnes Anderson of Gresham and Rep. Arnie Roblan, the Democratic co-speaker from Coos Bay.)

A quick look at our previous PolitiFact reveals the ad has not changed much over the past couple years. Much as it had originally, the mailer breaks the tax increase down to the second, noting that raising taxes by $1 billion in a single day comes down to more than $41 million an hour, or nearly $700,000 a minute, or $11,574 each second. And the question asked on the other side of the mailer is, ""Can we afford four more years of"" whichever candidate is being targeted.

The mailer also cites the same three taxes, House Bill 2649, 3405 and 2116, but adds a new one for this election -- HB 2001. Here’s what PolitiFact found last time regarding the first three bills:

""House Bill 2649 created two new tax brackets, including a 10.8 percent bracket for joint filers with income above $250,000 and for single filers with income above $125,000. For tax years after 2011, the rate is scheduled to drop to 9.9 percent. The bill also phased out some federal tax deductions. The Legislative Revenue Office estimated it would raise taxes for 2.5 percent of full-year individual filers (38,000) and 6.1 percent of returns (25,600) that report business income or loss. The proposal was projected to raise $472 million in 2009-11; it became Measure 66 in the January 2010 special election.

""House Bill 3405 raised the corporate minimum tax from $10 -- first set in 1931 and untouched until 2009 -- to a sliding scale of $150 to $100,000 depending on sales in Oregon. The $10 minimum for S-corporations went from $10 to $150. The bill also created a second tax rate of 7.9 percent and implemented filing fees. The Legislative Revenue Office estimated this would affect more than 75 percent of C-corporations and nearly all 62,000 S-corporations. The proposal was projected to raise $261 million in 2009-11; it became Measure 67 in the January 2010 special election.   

House Bill 2116 we explained this way: ""This proposal did two things. One, it levied a 1 percent tax on insurers, projected to raise more than $115 million in 2009-11 to insure 80,000 children. Two, it replaced an expiring tax paid by hospitals, and was projected to raise $300 million for low-income adults without health care. Hospitals, the entities paying the tax, actually backed the legislation because it would allow them to recoup more money from Medicaid. Two Republicans joined all 18 Democrats in the Senate to approve this bill.""

Together, those bills get us over the $1 billion mark.

This year, the mailer also includes HB 2001 for good measure. This bill increased the gas tax to 30 cents from 24 cents. The increase kicked in back in January 2011 and raised about $300 million in new revenue.

Altogether, the measures definitely boosted the state’s bottom line by more than $1 billion. But, as we noted two years ago, there are some significant caveats here.

First, it’s not necessarily accurate to hang all of these taxes exclusively on the heads of these candidates. With House Bill 2649 and 3405 in particular, the lawmakers had the help of voters. Anti-tax activists referred those two measures to the ballot, but a majority of Oregonians voted to keep the new taxes and so they remain. It’s also worth noting that the gas tax increase, while not referred to voters, passed on a bipartisan vote in both chambers.

Second, aside from the gas tax, these are not taxes that would hit the pocketbooks of the average Joe -- at least not directly. PolitiFact Oregon accepts that such taxes could affect employees and consumer prices as well as health care costs, but the ad makes the taxes seem much more direct.

Third, while we understand the place of hyperbole in campaigns, the per-second breakdown makes it sound as though these candidates are raising taxes ""at an unbelievable clip,"" as we noted two years ago.

Finally, we can’t help but point out that these taxes weren’t, in fact, passed on the same day -- the gas tax came earlier, and at least one version of the mailer lumps it in with the others.

We called Jason Williams of the Taxpayer Association of Oregon to see what he thought about our initial ruling -- and the context we’d pointed out. His opinion hasn’t changed much since we had this conversation two years ago. The taxes will hit people, whether at the pump, in their insurance plans or at their place of employment. ""Every time somebody taxes someone it is a negative impact on somebody's life,"" he said. ""It limits their spending power, it limits their freedom.""

Voters wouldn’t have been asked to approve any taxes if the Legislature hadn’t passed them in the first place, he said. Williams also noted that Hass, in particular, has voted to raise taxes by nearly a billion dollars twice before -- and voters ultimately rejected those increases. He agreed context is important, but noted that the bill numbers and years of passage were included in the mailer.

The last time we looked at this claim, we gave it a Half True. We noted then, as we do now, that while lawmakers did vote for $1 billion in new taxes in a single day, there were some important details missing -- the timing of the taxes, who had approved them and who was being taxed.

The mailer’s statements deserve some additional clarity, but we don’t think they ignore critical facts.

We rate this claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/nov/01/taxpayer-association-oregon/did-sen-mark-hass-raise-taxes-1-billion-single-day/
"['Economy', 'Federal Budget', 'Jobs', 'Taxes', 'Texas', 'Michael McCaul']","
Michael McCaul says U.S. corporate tax rate is world’s highest at 35 percent
","
Finally, a point where Republicans and at least one prominent Democrat agree. Like President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, Austin’s U.S. Rep. Michael McCaul says corporate tax rates are too high.

To a recent voters guide question on how to combat unemployment, McCaul -- a Republican seeking another term representing the 10th Congressional District -- gave responses that included lowering America’s ""corporate tax rate, highest in the world at 35 percent.""

A decrease to 25 percent would ""stop driving American businesses overseas,"" McCaul said in the guide, produced by the Austin and Texas chapters of the League of Women Voters and the Austin American-Statesman. McCaul faces Tawana Cadien (Democrat) and Richard Priest (Libertarian) on Nov. 6.

PolitiFact has recently checked corporate tax rate claims with a different figure, so we decided to compare this statement.

McCaul spokesman Mike Rosen told us by email that 35 percent is the top statutory rate for U.S. corporate taxes, citing an April 5, 2012, ""backgrounder"" from the Council on Foreign Relations.

The council, an independent, nonpartisan think-tank, said the U.S. had the highest corporate tax rate in the world by two measures: Excluding state and local taxes, the rate was 35 percent. With those sub-national taxes, the rate was 39.2 percent.

Most news stories we read while researching this fact-check used the latter rate -- combining federal, state and local. That’s the yardstick used in related PolitiFact articles, and it’s also the statistic that made headlines when an April 1, 2012, rate cut took effect in Japan and moved the U.S. into first place. 
The rest of the top five are France, Belgium and Germany, according to a September 2011 report by the Washington-based Tax Foundation that gave 2012 federal-plus-state/local rates, weighted to reflect the economies’ sizes so that small countries would not have a disproportional effect on the average. 
OECD statutory corporate tax rates, 2012 
 
Source: Tax Foundation 2011 report 


The foundation’s 2011 report and most of the news articles we read for this story limited their comparisons to advanced industrialized countries -- often citing the 34 members of the global Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
We asked foundation spokesman Richard Morrison for help tracking down country-by-country rates that did not include taxes below the federal level, to make an apples-to-apples comparison with McCaul’s 35 percent.

Morrison pointed us, via email, to an OECD web page with a chart showing those numbers for 2012.

The U.S. rate of 35 percent is the highest on the chart, with the other OECD nations averaging 23.6 percent (figures that, unlike the statistics cited above, are not weighted to reflect size of national economies).

So McCaul’s statement holds true for federal-level-only corporate tax rates as well as for the state/local-plus-federal rate.

But recent PolitiFact items have also taken into account the rate corporations pay after deductions and exemptions, called the effective rate.

In an Aug. 27, 2012, Truth-O-Meter article, PolitiFact New Jersey wrote, ""When you factor in various tax breaks, the rate actually paid by U.S. businesses has been among the highest in the world, but not in first place, studies show.""

The 2011 foundation report summarized 13 studies of effective corporate tax rates across the world, which used different methodologies and were not limited to the OECD roster. The smallest study compared 10 countries; the largest, 183.

Those studies found the U.S. effective tax rate ranging from 23 percent to 34.9 percent, which often placed it in the top five, but never No. 1.

But the U.S. hit the top spot in a more recent report. Morrison told us the latest such comparison was made in September 2012 for the libertarian Cato Institute. That report calculated the U.S. effective rate at 35.6 percent and ranked it highest among OECD nations but fourth among all 90 nations it examined.

How did U.S. rates get to be among the highest? Actually, other countries dropped theirs, we learned by phone from Jonathan Masters, author of the Council on Foreign Relations piece.

We found succinct descriptions of the history in Time magazine and The Hill, a Washington, D.C. newspaper. An April 2, 2012, Time blog post says that while the U.S. rate stayed steady for two decades, ""the trend internationally has been towards lower corporate tax rates."" The Hill’s Aug. 27, 2012 blog post says that in 1986, the OECD nations’ average corporate tax was 50 percent, but ""today, it’s 25 percent for those countries -- it has fallen in half. Meanwhile, the U.S. rate, which fell from 46 percent to 34 percent as a result of tax reform in 1986, is now stuck at 35 percent.""

Our ruling

McCaul said the U.S. ""corporate tax rate"" is the ""highest in the world at 35 percent.""

The rate set by federal statute is the highest, both by itself and when considering the federal rate plus state and local taxes.

However, there’s much less consensus about effective corporate tax rates -- the rates corporations actually pay. Studies don’t even agree on what the U.S. effective rate is, pegging it between 23 percent and 35.6 percent. Older studies put the U.S. near the top; a recent study says the U.S. is No. 1 among OECD nations.

Looking at Baldwin and a single-payer healthcare system for America
","
In the space of two days in the waning weeks of the U.S. Senate race, Democrat Tammy Baldwin declared her position on getting a single-payer healthcare system ""moot,"" ""irrelevant"" and ""hypothetical.""

Instead, she said, Congress should focus now on putting into place the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping healthcare law approved by congressional Democrats and signed into law by President Obama in March 2010.

Republicans, including Senate campaign rival Tommy Thompson, pounced on Baldwin’s remarks, with Thompson’s camp saying that Baldwin was ""trying to walk back her 14-year support for a single-payer health care system.""

Did Baldwin change her position on single-payer?

For an answer, let’s test that question on our Flip-O-Meter, which looks at  whether candidates have changed their position. Our standard disclaimer: We’re not rating the political or policy merits of any switch, just whether the candidate has been consistent over time.

Thompson moved to make the elimination of ""Obamacare"" a central part of the campaign, pledging in the primary to be the 51st vote to repeal it. Now, in the general election, he has been using Baldwin’s views to try to paint her as so ""extreme"" that she’s to the left of Obama.

Baldwin voted for the Affordable Care Act, which extended health insurance to millions of uninsured. But she also pushed for even more dramatic action, which she later described this way: ""I actually was for a government takeover of medicine. I was for a single-payer plan.""

Let’s look at Baldwin’s record on the issue.

Baldwin, who entered Congress in 1999, has advocated repeatedly for health care for all -- universal coverage -- and has publicly favored a financing mechanism called ""single payer,"" as we have documented in the past.

Here’s how she has defined the financing:

""Under a single-payer system, all Americans would be covered for all medically necessary services. Patients would regain free choice of doctor and hospital, and doctors would regain autonomy over patient care. A single-payer system would be financed by eliminating private insurers and recapturing their administrative waste.""

She continued: ""Modest new taxes would replace premiums and out-of-pocket payments currently paid by individuals and business. Costs would be controlled through negotiated fees, global budgeting, and bulk purchasing.""

That was from a Baldwin news release in 2006. Single-payer systems are in use in Europe and Canada, among other places. A 2011 law moved Vermont toward a universal, single payer system.

In that 2006 news release, Baldwin was announcing her co-sponsorship of a bipartisan bill, The Health Partnership through Creative Federalism Act, that would have given grants to states to try different approaches, including a single-payer system, to cover their uninsured residents.

In 2009, as the healthcare reform debate raged in Congress, Baldwin was part of a bloc of Democrats pushing for serious consideration of a single-payer system.

""I am one of the members of this committee who believes strongly that a single-payer health system is the best way to comprehensively and fairly reform our healthcare system,"" Baldwin said as the House Energy and Commerce Committee voted on Obama’s plan.

In the end, the bill did not go that route.

Under the law, employers will continue to provide health insurance to most Americans through private insurance companies. A larger number of people will get private health coverage through the creation of insurance exchanges. The law is expected to reduce the ranks of the uninsured by 30 million, but not completely eliminate them.

Since the passage of ""Obamacare,"" Baldwin has made few new public pronouncements about single payer, while making clear she still wants to at least try to take steps toward a single-payer system.

Her current House website praises ""Obamacare"" for taking an ""important step"" toward quality healthcare for all Americans, but makes clear she wants to go further.

She says she will work for allowing Americans the choice of a ""public option"", calling that ""essential."" The ""public option,"" which was considered during the 2009 debate, is an insurance plan administered and funded by the government that would be offered along with private insurance plans. Baldwin supported a public option during the healthcare reform debate, saying it could, if successful, lead to the single-payer system she supports.

At the 2010 political rally where she used the ""I was for a single-payer plan"" line, she praised Obamacare as ""incredible progress"" but her remarks suggested it was not the end of her quest to see all Americans get health insurance. She did not go into specifics of her strategy.

Taking all this history into account, during the 2012 Senate race we rated Mostly True a Thompson claim that Baldwin wants a ""completely government-controlled"" health care system that goes ""far beyond 'Obamacare'"" and is ""a Medicare system for all.""

Yet we could find little evidence Baldwin had addressed the issue in the context of the 2012 campaign.

That changed Oct. 24 and 25, 2012.

Asked by a Journal Sentinel editorial writer Oct. 24, 2012, whether she still supports moving to single-payer system, Baldwin responded that it’s a ""moot question.""

She said: ""It took 70 years for America to have a federal health policy. I certainly do not see that debate coming up. So it’s a hypothetical question.""

The next day, asked if she still supports single payer, she told reporters at an endorsement news conference that if elected, she would focus on implementing ""Obamacare,"" -- rather than advocating for having the government go even further as she has in the past. She called her position on single payer ""irrelevant.""

""We have a bill (the Affordable Care Act) that was passed. I worked on it. I voted for it. That's what our task is going forward. It doesn't matter the debates of a decade ago or even more recently. We have passed a bill. I voted for it, and now we need to put it to work and make it work for Wisconsin.""

Our rating

Baldwin, in her recent statements, did not renounce her support for a single-payer system so much as deflect questions about it. So this is not a major change of position that translates into a full flop.

But her line about being content to work now on implementing ""Obamacare"" is inconsistent with her public vow to push hard to go even further -- to a public option that could lead to a single-payer system. Baldwin did not say she was permanently shelving her prior strategy, but is setting it aside right now.

We think that earns her a Half Flip, which we define as a partial change of position or inconsistent statements.",/factchecks/2012/nov/01/tammy-baldwin/single-payer-healthcare-system-america/
"['Environment', 'Ohio', 'Cap and Trade', 'Climate Change', 'Voting Record', 'Josh Mandel']","
Josh Mandel campaign labels Sherrod Brown an ""Obama rubber stamp"" over cap-and-trade
","U.S. Sen. Sherrod Brown took considerable heat for his position on cap-and-trade legislation.

He voted against it in the Senate, which disappointed and even outraged some environmentalists. It was among the biggest issues on which Brown, Ohio's Democratic incumbent, split with President Barack Obama.

That was why PolitiFact Ohio was surprised to hear a radio ad for Brown's Republican challenger, Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel.

The ad blasts Brown for ""supporting the job-killing cap-and-trade plan"" and labels him an  ""Obama rubber stamp.""

We asked the Mandel campaign how that claim was supported, and we reviewed the background.

Cap and trade legislation seeks to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from power plants and other greenhouse gas sources by setting caps on the amount of pollutants a plant can spew into the air. Companies that come in below their cap are then allowed to sell their emission credits to other companies that need them. Supporters say the approach provides economic incentives to reduce pollution and innovate. Critics deride it as an energy tax and say it increases costs for everyone.

The approach was originally employed to curb the pollutants that cause acid rain in the early 1990s. President George H.W. Bush championed it, with the support of both Democrats and Republicans in Congress. In 2008, it was one of the few areas of common ground between Obama and his opponent, Sen. John McCain. Both acknowledged climate change and favored carbon caps.

In June 2008, Brown joined Republicans in voting to block a bill which would have imposed a cap-and-trade system of credits for carbon dioxide emissions.

He said he would have liked to support the bill, but he said the measure would place too high a cost on Ohio industry and threatened jobs.

In spring 2009, after Obama had taken office, Brown proposed legislation to provide incentives for manufacturers to adopt green technologies, but said it ""doesn't cause me at all to change any position from last year"" opposing a cap-and-trade system.

He voted shortly afterward to keep the fast-track budget reconciliation process open on an emissions bill, so that it would not face a filibuster, but said he still had significant concerns about the legislation.

""I'm an environmentalist,"" he said. ""I want cap and trade. I just want to make sure that the ratepayers in my state don't get socked hard. And that the manufacturing doesn't get crippled.""
Mandel's campaign cited that quote as a source for its assertion that ""Brown was open to supporting a cap-and-trade proposal.""

But being open to support falls short of endorsement.
Before cap-and-trade legislation stalled and then died in the Senate, the New York Times reported in October 2009 that ""Brown has not been shy about embracing the cap-and-trade policy (but) he also has not endorsed the bill.""

Brown ""has bluntly stated that unless the (carbon emissions bill's) authors agree to a variety of manufacturing and trade provisions, there is little possibility that the legislation will get anywhere near enough support to clear the Senate,"" the article said.

""Clean energy legislation is not just about the environment, it's about creating jobs and revitalizing our nation's manufacturing basis,"" Brown said. ""For a clean energy bill to be successful, it must also be a jobs bill that partners with the business community.""

In early 2011, with no legislation on the table, The Plain Dealer reported that Brown and the coal industry ""both are trying in their own ways to stop President Barack Obama's administration from imposing rules this year on new or upgraded power plants and large factories that use coal because, both say, the rules would hurt Ohio manufacturers and consumers.""

What's the capper on the ad's claim?

The Mandel ad labeled Brown ""an Obama rubberstamp"" for ""supporting the job-killing cap and trade plan.""

We’ll leave the phrase ""job-killing"" to those who debate policy. As a statement of opinion, PolitiFact Ohio won’t rate it.

Regardless, the statement is not accurate. Rather, it invokes the fear of a proposed system for limiting emissions that Congress could never agree on and to this day does not exist.

Brown has expressed support for some form of emissions controls and has said that under the right conditions, he would support cap-and-trade legislation. But it’s also clear that he had reservations about the legislation that has been before the Senate.

When the 2009 bill was pending, Brown never endorsed it. He ""bluntly stated that unless the (carbon emissions bill's) authors agree to a variety of manufacturing and trade provisions, there is little possibility that the legislation will get anywhere near enough support to clear the Senate,"" according to The New York Times. That bill stalled in the Senate and died without a final vote.

In 2008, prior to Obama becoming president, Brown joined Republicans and voted to block a bill that would have created a cap-and-trade system of credits for carbon dioxide emissions.

That is far from being a rubber stamp on the issue.

Voters First Ohio claims Issue 2 is endorsed by Ohio Conference NAACP
","
Issue 2, the redistricting reform proposal on the Nov. 6 ballot with broad support from Democrats, has not gained unanimous support from black political leaders.

The president of Ohio Legislative Black Caucus in September voiced concerns to Gongwer News Service about how Issue 2 would affect African-American representation in Congress and in the Ohio Senate and House of Representatives.

In response to the caucus’ concerns, Sandy Theis, a spokeswoman for the pro-Issue 2 group Voters First Ohio, told Gongwer that the Ohio Conference NAACP has endorsed Issue 2. The website for Voters First also lists the organization – although it is labeled incorrectly as the NAACP Ohio Chapter – among the group’s endorsers.

The splintered support for Issue 2 among black leaders got PolitiFact Ohio’s curiosity up, so it decided to look into where exactly the NAACP stands on Issue 2.

Issue 2 is a proposed amendment to the Ohio Constitution that would reform the way the state's congressional and legislative boundaries are drawn, a process known as redistricting that happens every 10 years.

Elected officials, including the governor and legislative leaders, control the current redistricting process. District boundary lines typically are drawn to favor whichever party is in power. Last year, Republicans, who control state government, drew new lines that grouped voters into districts designed to help Republicans win future elections.

Issue 2 would remove elected officials from the redistricting process and hand the responsibility over to a new redistricting commission. Should Issue 2 pass, a commission would be appointed next year to draw new maps for the 2014 election.

It’s worth pointing out that, under the new maps, Ohio voters could elect two black women to Congress this fall for the first time: incumbent Democrat Marcia Fudge, of Warrensville Heights, and Democrat Joyce Beatty, who is running in the Columbus-area 3rd District created during the GOP-controlled redistricting.

The Ohio Legislative Black Caucus, due to concerns over future African-American political representation, has voted to not endorse Issue 2 since the Gongwer story was published on Sept. 25, said Rep. Sandra Williams, a Cleveland Democrat and president of the caucus.

So where does the Ohio Conference NAACP stand on Issue 2?

""The NAACP has not blanketly endorsed Issue 2,"" Sybil Edwards-McNabb, the organization’s president, said in a telephone interview on Oct. 24.

Edwards McNabb said the group has concerns about how the proposed redistricting commission would operate and how the new system would affect African-American political representation.

""We may not have the same representation,"" she said. ""We could pick up more, but we might lose all of it. That’s a concern.""

Despite these concerns, Edwards-McNabb said it would be inaccurate to say the group does not support Issue 2.

Huh?

""Sometimes when you’re not saying ‘no’ somebody might perceive that as a ‘yes’ and that’s not necessarily true,"" Edwards-McNabb said. ""But we are not against Issue 2. We need a change in our redistricting process. It needs to be thoroughly thought through. We need another level of clarity.""

If the Ohio NAACP officially has not endorsed Issue 2, we asked Edwards-McNabb if she asked Voters First to remove the group’s name from the list of Voters First supporters. She said an e-mail has been sent to Voters First. ""We have a dialogue and our concerns have been heard,"" she said.

We asked Theis why she told Gongwer the NAACP endorsed Issue 2. She said two Voters First consultants had conversations with two NAACP executives who support Voters First and support NAACP members who campaign for the passage of Issue 2.

Tom Roberts, the Ohio Conference NAACP’s political action chair, is one group member campaigning for Issue 2. Roberts, who also is third vice president of the NAACP’s Dayton chapter, said members of the organization are free to support Issue 2.

""I know it doesn’t make sense to some people, but we never got to the point of endorsement,"" he said in an interview on Oct. 17. ""I think the safest thing to say is we don’t endorse it but we have agreed to support community involvement in the process.""

So where does that leave us?

Although there appears to be some support for Issue 2 from within the Ohio Conference NAACP, the bottom line is that the group, as a whole, has not endorsed Issue 2.

Voters First’s statement that the NAACP endorses the redistricting proposal contains an element of truth. The Ohio Conference NAACP president says there is support for changing the system for redistricting.

But the organization also has concerns about the impact Issue 2 could have on black political representation, and it has not formally endorsed Issue 2.

Those are critical facts absent from the Voters First claim that would give a different impression.

Round Rock candidate says school board president wants condom techniques demonstrated ""to your children""
","
A November 2012 challenger to the president of the Round Rock school board says the incumbent, Chad Chadwell, ""wants condom techniques demonstrated to your children.""

The claim appears in a leaflet sent to voters by Tere McCann which also says: ""Scientific sex education helped reduce teen pregnancies in Round Rock. But Chadwell thinks that now we need to actually demonstrate condom techniques to thirteen-year-olds."" That text appears below what looks like a sheet of paper listing a ""class schedule"" with the subjects history, geography and math crossed out in red with ""condom techniques"" yet to be struck.

On its reverse side, the mailer mentions the Round Rock Leader newspaper and also says the Austin American-Statesman reported Chadwell saying that he ""supported showing students how to effectively use a condom.""

Asked the basis of his claim, McCann directed us to his campaign manager, Bill Gravell, who pointed out news stories in the Leader, a twice-weekly Williamson County newspaper, and American-Statesman.

A Leader news story posted online Oct. 17, 2012, says that six days earlier, the Round Rock school board discussed an August 2012 advisory panel recommendation to shift to an ""abstinence-plus"" sex education curriculum from the existing approach of teaching abstinence only.

According to the story, the proposed curriculum would feature ""at least one lesson on effective use of contraception methods, beginning with eighth-grade students and continuing in high school, according to information presented to board members in August.""

By telephone, Susan Nix, a district official familiar with its sex education curriculum, told us middle-school students are not now taught about contraception, though contraceptive methods, including condoms, are mentioned in high-school classes otherwise stressing the benefits of abstinence.

According to the Leader story, board member Catherine Hanna said during the board’s October gathering that students should be given complete information about the effectiveness of condoms. ""Giving children the incomplete information about condom effectiveness steers them away from condom use if they choose to have sex,"" Hanna said. ""If we want to stress using condoms effectively, why not show them?""

The article says Chadwell said he agreed with Hanna, regarding showing students how to properly use a condom. ""I would rather risk making a few students and teachers feel uncomfortable and show them condom use and prevent some teen pregnancies,"" Chadwell said, according to the article, which quotes the district superintendent, Jesús Chávez, as saying that members can bring the recommendation up again at the board’s Nov. 15, 2012 meeting.

On Oct. 20, 2012, the Statesman published a summary of the Leader story stating Hanna and Chadwell had said they supported showing students how to effectively use a condom.

McCann’s campaign subsequently highlighted Chadwell’s quoted comment in a press release headlined ""Teaching Middle School students how to put on a Condom is Not Consistent with the Values of Round Rock."" The release says that according to the Leader, Chadwell wants to teach middle-school students how to put on condoms. ""Do we really want to be showing our 13-year-old children how to use condoms?"" McCann said in the release.

In reaction, Chadwell emailed a statement to reporters that does not directly contradict McCann’s description of his remarks. The statement says that no specific ages were mentioned at the board meeting and that the board had asked the superintendent to ""prepare an age-appropriate sex ed curriculum"" for middle- and high-school students with a staff recommendation to be presented at the Nov. 15 board meeting.

Seeking detail, we watched the district’s video recording of the meeting, which showed that board members heard a presentation by Blair Murphy of Scott & White’s ""Worth the Wait"" program, which provides the district’s middle-school sex education curriculum.

Murphy told board members that the proposal would result in a lesson covering several contraceptive methods including condoms joined by the message that abstinence is the only completely effective, healthy method.

Condom demonstrations would not occur, Murphy said.

""We do not do condom demonstrations in the classroom,"" she said. ""We won’t be showing students how to use a condom with a fruit or anything like that."" A slide summarizing the condom portion of the lesson says ""facts you need to know"" are that condoms should be consistently used correctly; that they have a higher pregnancy result than some other methods; and that a condom should only be used once.

Asked by a board member (not Chadwell) why students are not shown how to use condoms, Murphy said that’s probably best done in a private setting with a health professional who can give advice.

According to the video, Chadwell did not explicitly mention showing students condom use. That’s contrary to his quotation in the Leader story later echoed in the Statesman.

Then again, Chadwell initially told his colleagues a story about the ineffectiveness of instructing residents in a foreign country by placing a condom on a stick. He then said: ""My view is I would rather risk offending a few peoples and students, embarrassing them a little bit, if it stops a few pregnancies, and if that’s what that means.""

Adding that the idea of abstinence is ""great,"" Chadwell continued: ""So at the risk of offending a few people, I would almost rather have it as a standard, of saying that we are going to teach everything that is going to be embarrassing.""

Later in the meeting, Chadwell agreed with Chávez, the superintendent, who said he was taking the discussion as a sign the district should initiate a lesson on contraceptives extending from eighth grade into high school, though Chávez said he would like more discussion of whether condom use should be taught and whether the contraception lesson should be implemented this school year.

By phone, we asked Chadwell what he meant by telling the story of the ineffectiveness of instructing individuals by putting condoms onto sticks. He said the point was to emphasize the importance of teaching about contraceptives in a way that truly educates students. ""I don’t want the school district to show a very G-rated version of a sex education program that is not (also) effective,"" he said, adding that what students are taught should be based on guidance from curricular experts.

We asked, too, what Chadwell meant by saying the district would be teaching ""everything that is embarrassing."" He replied that the topic of sex education is embarrassing. He then speculated that students could be taught about proper condom use with an animation or illustration or another expert-endorsed approach, though he said he has not warmed to--and did not advocate--classroom demonstrations of any birth-control devices.

Our ruling

McCann said Chadwell ""wants condom techniques demonstrated to your children.""

This statement has an element of truth in that Chadwell supports a developing proposal that could lead to students from eighth grade into high school being taught about contraceptive methods, including condoms.

However, Chadwell was not explicit about supporting classroom condom demonstrations, we learned. It’s notable, too, that the presenter who stirred board discussion declared that condom demonstrations are not part of the contemplated lesson. These critical facts are absent from McCann’s claim. 
All told, we see a gaping difference between supporting a lesson on various contraceptive methods and advocating show-and-tell condom demonstrations.

We rate this claim as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/nov/01/tere-mccann/round-rock-candidate-says-school-board-president-w/

Was Jimmy Carter the last president to call Israeli settlements illegal?
","During a CNN town hall with Democratic presidential candidate Marianne Williamson, an audience member asked her, ""Where do you stand on Israel and Palestine?"" Williamson said the United States should have ""an absolute, simultaneous and equal support"" of both Israel’s concerns about its own security and also the Palestinians’ ""human rights and dignities and economic opportunities."" As Williamson continued, she referenced Israeli settlements in the West Bank -- territory that was captured by Israel during the 1967 Six Day War and is viewed by Palestinians as the basis of a future state. Today, an estimated 400,000 Israelis live in settlements in the West Bank, plus 200,000 in east Jerusalem. Williamson said: ""It has been a long time since the United States could actually be considered by either side as an honest broker. With me as president, they will know that they have in the United States a president who listens deeply. … It's been since Jimmy Carter that we've had a U.S. president to say flat out those settlements are illegal. In me, you would have a president who says those settlements are illegal."" The discussion of Israeli settlements was timely, because shortly before winning re-election as Israel’s prime minister about a week earlier, Benjamin Netanyahu broke with precedent by saying he would annex the West Bank. Critics said that would endanger a future deal that could include a Palestinian state. The Trump administration hasn’t officially weighed in on the annexation idea, but the administration previously made several moves that align with Netanyahu’s wishes even though they had been rejected by previous U.S. presidents of both parties. The moves include relocating the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem and announcing that the Golan Heights — a different territory captured by Israel in the 1967 war — ""are part of the State of Israel."" Given the shifts in policy under the Trump administration, we wondered whether Williamson was correct to say that Carter was the last ""U.S. president to say flat out those  settlements are illegal."" (Williamson’s campaign did not respond to an inquiry.) We found nuances in the often-murky diplomatic language. And Carter didn’t literally use the word ""illegal"" while he was president. At a June 1980 question-and-answer session with the American Jewish Press Association, Carter was asked whether he considered the settlements ""illegal."" He stopped just short of using that word. ""We consider these settlements to be contrary to the Geneva Convention, that occupied territories should not be changed by the establishment of permanent settlements by the occupying power,"" he said, adding, ""We have long maintained this position under the administration of previous presidents, back at least 15 years, that the establishment of settlements in that area was contrary to progress toward a comprehensive peace."" Lara Friedman, the president of the Foundation for Middle East Peace, which supports a two-state solution, told PolitiFact that, ""in effect, Carter was agreeing with the assertion that he views settlements as illegal — in that they were contrary to the Geneva Convention, meaning illegal — without using that word himself."" At least one of Carter’s subordinates went so far as to use the word ""illegal"" — the United States representative to the United Nations, William Scranton, in a 1976 speech. ""Substantial resettlement of the Israeli civilian population in occupied territories, including in East Jerusalem, is illegal under the (Geneva) Convention,"" Scanton said. Friedman added that a group of memos to Carter from his chief of staff Hamilton Jordan used the term ""illegal"" in relation to Israeli settlements 16 times. As for Carter himself, it took him until his post-presidential years to actually use the word ""illegal"" himself. During a 1983 press conference during a trip to the Middle East, Carter said, ''Settlements are illegal and an obstacle to peace."" In a 1982 address to the nation, Reagan called for a freeze in settlements as part of peace negotiations, but he didn’t call them ""illegal."" ""The immediate adoption of a settlement freeze by Israel, more than any other action, could create the confidence needed for wider participation in these talks,"" Reagan said. ""Further settlement activity is in no way necessary for the security of Israel and only diminishes the confidence of the Arabs and a final outcome can be freely and fairly negotiated."" In a speech the following year, Reagan used a turn of phrase short of ""illegal"" that would recur in future years — that settlements are an ""obstacle to peace."" In 1990, Bush reaffirmed the United States’ stance, again without saying ""illegal."" ""The United States policy on settlement in the occupied territories is unchanged and is clear, and that is, we oppose new settlements in territories beyond the 1967 lines. It is a stated, reaffirmed policy over and over again,"" Bush said during a news conference with Russia’s Mikhail Gorbachev. During the rest of his term, Bush didn’t use the term ""illegal,"" but U.S. policy turned against settlements in ways that irritated Israel. Bush insisted on settlement-related conditions for loan guarantees for Israel, and his secretary of state, James Baker, offered the ""sharpest criticism of Israel on settlements in history,"" Friedman said. The Bush White House ""considered settlements a serious enough obstacle to push back quite significantly,"" said Samer S. Shehata, an associate professor in Middle East studies at the University of Oklahoma. In 1996, Clinton continued to use the phrase ""obstacle to peace,"" and in 2001, he said that settlements were ""inconsistent"" with the commitment in the Oslo peace negotiations that ""both sides negotiate a compromise."" And the Clinton-commissioned Mitchell Report — a ""fact-finding"" panel headed by former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell — called on Israel to ""freeze all settlement activity, including the 'natural growth' of existing settlements."" Khaled Elgindy, a fellow in the Brookings Institution’s Center for Middle East Policy, said dropping the ""obstacle to peace"" language amounted to a softening of U.S. rhetoric. The Clinton administration ""carved out various exemptions that allow Israel to continue building in some settlements,"" Elgindy said. Subsequent administrations also allowed settlement expansions of various types on an ad-hoc basis, he said. The George W. Bush administration put forward a ""roadmap"" for peace, which included a settlement freeze and a removal of settlement outposts erected since 2001. We found no examples of Bush using the word ""illegal"" or ""obstacle to peace."" In a June 2009 speech in Cairo, Obama heightened the rhetoric on the illegitimacy of Israeli settlements, but without using the word ""illegal."" ""Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel’s right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine’s,"" Obama said. ""The United States does not accept the legitimacy of continued Israeli settlements. This construction violates previous agreements and undermines efforts to achieve peace. It is time for these settlements to stop."" Then, in 2013, Secretary of State John Kerry echoed that language after a meeting with Mahmoud Abbas, the Palestinian president. ""The position of the United States is that we consider now, and have always considered, the settlements to be illegitimate,"" Kerry said. Trump expressed some caution on settlements early in his presidency, telling the newspaper Israel Hayom in February 2017 that settlements ""don’t help the process."" He added, ""Every time you take land for settlements, there is less land left. But we are looking at that, and we are looking at some other options, we’ll see. But no, I am not somebody that believes that going forward with these settlements is a good thing for peace."" That same month, in a press conference with Netanyahu, Trump said, ""As far as settlements, I’d like to see you hold back on settlements for a little bit."" In September 2017, U.S. Ambassador to Israel David Friedman said in a television interview, ""I think the settlements are part of Israel,"" though the State Department later walked back the idea that this was a shift in policy. More recently, Trump’s moves on the U.S. Embassy and the Golan Heights have fueled speculation that he might go further in accepting Israeli settlements, and pro-settlement groups are lobbying the administration to take the leap. In an Israeli television interview in April 2019, Netanyahu was asked why he wasn’t yet pushing Trump to change U.S. policy. ""Wait until the next term,"" he replied. So Carter never used the term ""illegal."" But broadly speaking, U.S. statements about the settlements’ legality have gone from tough under Carter to somewhat less tough, though in a bit of a zigzagging way. ""There has definitely been a softening, and it has never reverted back"" to what it was under Carter, said David Makovsky, director of the Project on Arab-Israel Relations at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. Elgindy of Brookings also said it’s reasonable to separate Carter’s rhetoric. ""He does stand out substantively from his successors,"" he said. Friedman, Foundation for Middle East Peace, added that it’s important to distinguish between rhetoric and policies. ""While the wording under Carter may have been tougher about the legal status of settlements, it was subsequent presidents who tried to put some actual meat on the bones of U.S. anti-settlement policy,"" she said. ""It was Reagan who first called for a settlement freeze. It was George H.W. Bush who imposed conditions on loan guarantees tied to Israel's settlements policy. It was under Clinton, George W. Bush, and Obama that the U.S. again called for a settlement freeze."" It’s also important not to get overly focused on the question of legality, Makovsky said. The settlements could still be considered a political ""irritant without being illegal,"" he said. Williamson said that Jimmy Carter was the last ""U.S. president to say flat out those (Israeli) settlements are illegal."" We couldn’t find an example of Carter actually using the word ""illegal"" to refer to Israeli settlements while he was president. However, he did as an ex-president, and experts agreed that his rhetoric came closer than the words used by his successors in the Oval Office. At the same time, it’s important to note that subsequent presidents’ actual policies may have had more teeth than Carter’s, despite his tougher rhetoric.

Did Republicans rush to repeal law preventing the mentally ill from buying guns in 2017?
","If elected president in 2020, California Rep. Eric Swalwell promises to break the deadlock on gun control legislation. So far, he has teamed up with Parkland survivor Cameron Kasky and other anti-gun violence organizations. He also proposed a national ban and buyback of semi-automatic assault weapons. Like Washington Gov. Jay Inslee on climate change, Swalwell is distinguishing himself from his many opponents in the Democratic primary by focusing on one issue. After announcing his candidacy on ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" Swalwell held a campaign rally in his hometown of Dublin, Calif. During the speech, he said: ""In 2017, Republicans took control of the House, the Senate, and the presidency. Sorry to remind you. The very first piece of legislation that they passed — the act that would tell the world, ‘These are the values we espouse above all others’ — was a bill that made it easier for the mentally ill to purchase guns. They called it House Joint Resolution 40."" The fourth-term congressman accurately described the Republican-sponsored law, but it wasn’t the first to pass that year. H.J. Res. 40 undid a Social Security Administration rule requiring the agency to report certain disabled applicants to the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. Federal law stipulates that anyone ""who has been adjudicated as a mental defective or has been committed to any mental institution"" cannot own a gun. In 2008, George W. Bush signed the NICS Improvement Amendment Act, which mandated federal agencies to report certain disabled individuals to the database. Federally licensed firearms dealers use the database to screen potential gun buyers. The SSA rule was issued in 2016 to comply with the NICS Improvement Amendment Act. The Obama administration said that it would affect ""the approximately 75,000 people each year who have a documented mental health issue, receive disability benefits, and are unable to manage those benefits because of their mental impairment, or who have been found by a state or federal court to be legally incompetent."" It also included a mechanism for people to seek an exemption from the ban on owning a gun for mental health reasons. But in 2017, Republicans — backed by the National Rifle Association and disability rights groups — initiated a rarely-used process to void the SSA rule. At the forefront of the effort was Iowa Sen. Charles Grassley, who argued that the federal regulation stigmatized people with disabilities and infringed on the constitutional right to bear arms. A blog post by the American Civil Liberties Union said, ""The thousands of Americans whose disability benefits are managed by someone else range from young people with depression and financial inexperience to older adults with Down syndrome needing help with a limited budget. But no data — none — show that these individuals have a propensity for violence in general or gun violence in particular."" Other organizations opposed the reversal. The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence released a statement that said if H.J. Res. 40 passed, ""people considered a danger to themselves or others will once again be allowed to get guns."" Some states have their own laws on reporting certain disabled people to the NICS or a similar state database, according to the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence. President Donald Trump signed H.J. Res. 40 into law on Feb. 28, 2017. But it wasn’t the first law passed by the Republican-controlled Congress that year. It wasn’t even the first joint resolution. The laws passed before that included measures to nullify environmental protections related to coal mining and promote women and girls in STEM careers. Swalwell said that after Republicans won the majority in both chambers of Congress, the first law they passed made it easier for the mentally ill to purchase guns. He was correct that H.J. Res. 40 eliminated barriers for certain disabled individuals to buy guns, but it wasn’t the first law passed in 2017.

"['Taxes', 'Illinois', 'Think Big Illinois']","
Pritzker-backed group strays from facts in income-tax claim
","One of the biggest debates now playing out in Springfield centers on whether Illinois should replace its flat-rate income tax with a graduated system that taxes higher income at higher rates. Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker recently proposed a series of rates he says would generate billions in new revenue while raising taxes only on the wealthiest 3% of Illinoisans, those reporting income of more than $250,000. Before lawmakers can take up his proposal, however, they must first add a question to the 2020 ballot asking voters to replace language in the state constitution that mandates a flat income tax. While Democrats control the legislature, approval of any referendum to change the constitution requires an extraordinary majority of votes, so securing approval for Pritzker’s ballot question is far from certain. Meanwhile, interest groups representing both sides in the debate are busy trying to sway public opinion. We recently rated False a claim from a business-linked group opposing Pritzker’s plan, which said it contained a ""permanent jobs tax on middle-class families."" Now, Think Big Illinois, a Pritzker-backed group, is out with an ad pushing for a graduated tax that makes its own puzzling assertion. ""In almost every state with an income tax, wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than the middle class,"" a narrator says in the ad, as a map highlights the states with graduated income taxes under the banner ""STATES WITH A FAIR INCOME TAX SYSTEM."" It’s true Illinois is one of just nine states that currently tax income at a flat rate, while 32 others levy taxes under a series of graduated rates and a handful have no state income tax. Pritzker’s proposal, if approved as is, would indeed charge higher rates only on the wealthy. But that isn’t necessarily the case with graduated tax systems in other states. Just as Pritzker’s opponents have branded the graduated tax a ""jobs tax,"" Pritzker and his supporters label it a ""fair tax,"" both in the text of Think Big Illinois’ ad and in conversation. By ""fair,"" the Pritzker camp means a tax system that charges higher rates on higher levels of income. ""I’ve said from the beginning that it doesn’t make sense that I pay the same rate as a teacher or first responder,"" Pritzker, a billionaire three times over, said in a statement included in a recent press release about the proposed language for his constitutional amendment. But just because a state applies different rates to different amounts of income doesn’t mean only the wealthy pay top rates. In neighboring Missouri, for example, the state’s top rate of 5.4% is levied on all income over $8,424, according to the Tax Foundation, which compiles state tax rates and brackets annually. Alabama’s top rate kicks in even sooner — after the first $3,000 for single filers. Eight other states also begin levying their highest rates on income below $25,000, the Tax Foundation’s chart shows. That’s a far cry from what anyone would consider ""wealthy."" So we asked Think Big Illinois what their ad meant when it said ""almost every state"" with an income tax applied higher rates to the wealthy, given that nine states levy the same tax on everyone and a total of 10 others apply their top rates to all but the poorest. A spokeswoman responded with an email that did not directly address the language used by the narrator in the ad. ""Almost every state with an income tax employs a graduated tax system like a fair tax that taxes those with higher incomes at a higher rate,"" wrote Lara Sisselman, the group’s communications director. ""Illinois is just one of nine states that has an income tax, but taxes everyone at the same rate."" With nearly half of income-taxing states not charging higher rates to the wealthy, it’s clear the ad’s claim is off base. But it also got us wondering how the other graduated-tax states compare when it comes to taxing the middle class. There is no universally accepted definition of ""middle class,"" but a reasonable barometer is supplied by the U.S. Census, which charts median income of households, families and single-person homes for each state. Comparing those federal guideposts with the Tax Foundation’s chart, we found 14 states in which people making the median income for any household type would clearly not pay the state’s top rate on any dollar they make. Even California’s fourth-highest rate for single filers applies only to income over $286,492, for instance. And in New York, only earnings greater than $215,400 for single filers and $323,200 for married couples are subject to the state’s second-highest rate, while its highest is reserved for amounts exceeding $1 million. But there are another eight states where the top rate kicks in not far from the median income or at a level many academic definitions of ""middle class"" would still appear to encompass. The median income listed by the Census for the category of people that most closely approximates single filers in Arkansas, for example, is just over $25,000, while the state’s top tax rate kicks in after the first $37,200 a taxpayer earns. Then there’s Louisiana, where median family income is just over $60,000, while the top tax rate for married couples applies only after the first $100,000 they make. Still, it’d be a tough sell to argue that all taxpayers who pay top rates on some of their income in those states are necessarily wealthy, especially depending on family size. Think Big Illinois’ ad claims that, ""in almost every state with an income tax, wealthy people pay a higher tax rate than the middle class."" A spokeswoman for the Pritzker-backed group noted that Illinois is one of just nine states that tax income at a flat rate. Images that accompany the ad hint at that, but the narration ignores any nuance. Even by the most conservative definition, there are 19 states with income taxes that do not apply higher rates to the earnings of the wealthy — nine flat tax states and 10 with graduated taxes with rates that top out at income below $25,000. Add in another eight states where top rates for married couples kick in somewhere between $31,000 and $104,000 and the Think Big claim becomes even more dubious. That means far from ""almost every"" income-taxing state levies a higher rate on top earners, earning this claim a rating of Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The vote by Democrats in the New York State Legislature to delay or deny expanded college benefits for families of servicemembers, as described in a Republican-sponsored bill, became national news. Five days after Trump’s tweet, Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, took executive action to expand financial aid for certain military families, as Republicans had proposed. We decided to investigate this claim from the president. The bill in question, A.2991, would expand an existing financial aid program for dependent survivors of military members who died, were severely and permanently disabled, or were classified as missing in action while in combat or preparing for combat. The military enhanced recognition, incentive and tribute scholarship program, or MERIT, already provides tuition and other expenses at approved colleges in New York state for these dependents, or for military members who became severely and permanent disabled themselves during combat or in training for combat. Covered expenses include tuition for four years, or for five years for selected five-year programs, equal to in-state State University of New York tuition, or the student’s actual tuition, whichever is less. Allowances for room and board, transportation, and books are also included. In 2018-19, the benefit is $24,250 for students living on campus, and $15,750 for students who commute to school, according to the Higher Education Services Corporation. Additional eligibility requirements apply, such as being enrolled as a full-time student and being in good academic standing. In 2018, an estimated 111 students received this award, totaling $1.8 million, according to Cuomo. The bill, sponsored by Assemblyman Stephen Hawley, R-Batavia, would have expanded eligibility for the program beyond combat involvement to include spouses, children, and financial dependents of service members who died or were severely disabled or were classified as missing in action while carrying out their military duties.   Hawley’s proposal is not new for the Assembly’s Higher Education Committee. The bill has been introduced for many years, and it has never made it out of committee, which, like the Assembly, is controlled by Democrats. The bill’s legislative history indicates that it has been around since 2006, and was ""held for consideration"" in committee in 2010, 2012 and 2014, which effectively ended any progress it would have toward becoming law. On April 9, a motion to hold the bill for consideration was supported by 15 Democrats, and opposed by four Democrats and seven Republicans.     Assembly Democrats said they supported the original Merit Scholarship program by voting in favor of the budget on April 1. The expansion, they said, came up for a vote after the budget was approved. ""Discussing budget items outside of the budget is fiscally irresponsible and is generally only done for political gamesmanship,"" said Assembly Higher Education Committee Chairwoman Deborah Glick, D-Manhattan. The Merit Scholarship program is included in the budget and has been around since 2003, and Assembly Democrats have fully funded the program for more than 15 years, Glick said.   Trump referred to ""Gold Star families,"" a phrase that state lawmakers also used in describing this bill. The Department of Defense does not have an official definition for ""Gold Star families,"" said department spokesperson Jessica Maxwell. The department, however, distributes Gold Star lapel buttons to family members under criteria outlined in a December 2016 memo, Maxwell said. The criteria is different during different time periods, though in all cases is limited to families of service members who have lost their lives. The criteria include but are not limited to service members engaged in hostilities, those who died during terrorist attacks, or while they were engaged in peacekeeping operations. It’s possible those eligible for a Gold Star lapel button could also be affected by this expansion, though it’s certain other military families will as well. The second part of Trump’s statement is accurate, according to PolitiFact New York's check on a similar claim. Democrats lead both houses of the State Legislature, and they included $27 million for college tuition assistance to undocumented students in the budget finalized on April 1, funding the Jose Peralta Dream Act.   Trump tweeted that Democrats blocked a bill expanding college tuition for Gold Star families after approving aid for illegal immigrants. On April 9, Democrats in the Assembly’s Higher Education Committee voted 15-11 in favor of holding a bill to expand benefits for certain military families for consideration, as the committee had done several times before, effectively ending its progression to becoming law. Trump said ""Gold Star families,"" though there is no official federal definition, according to the Department of Defense. Democrats also approved college tuition assistance for undocumented immigrants during the current legislative session and as part of the budget, which was approved April 1. We rate Trump’s statement True.  ",/factchecks/2019/apr/20/donald-trump/trump-calls-out-ny-dems-vote-expansion-military-be/
"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Medicare', 'Tim Ryan']","
$50 billion in Medicare waste? Yes, that's how much in 'improper payments' are made per year
","At a town hall in New Hampshire, U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, one of the many Democrats running for president in 2020, was asked how he would stop the federal government from wasting taxpayer money. ""This has got to be a major initiative for Democrats; we don’t talk enough about waste in the government,"" Ryan replied. ""If you look at the Medicare program, for example, there is $50 billion a year wasted in the Medicare program. That’s a billion dollars a week."" It’s a claim the 45-year-old Youngstown-area resident, a moderate who has been in Congress since 2003, has made going back to at least 2017. Waste is enough a problem that it is part of an acronym used by the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services: FWA, for fraud, waste and abuse. In a training manual for employees, CMS says with bold type and an exclamation point that ""combating FWA is everyone’s responsibility!"" Ryan’s figure is solid. But let’s see whether it’s really ""waste."" Medicare is health insurance primarily for people 65 and older, but it also helps millions of citizens with disabilities. It is massive: The program spends about $700 billion per year serving some 58 million Americans and making payments to 1 million entities. Lately, some Democrats who have announced or are pondering a run for president have made claims about huge cuts to Medicare. Those statements haven’t fared all that well on our Truth-O-Meter. To back Ryan’s statement, his campaign cited 2018 testimony to a congressional subcommittee from a gold-standard source, the U.S. Government Accountability Office, which is a nonpartisan auditing and investigative agency that serves Congress. The testimony from Seto Bagdoyan, a GAO director of audit services, was on recommendations for handling fraud in Medicare. He said that during fiscal year 2017 — Oct. 1, 2016 through Sept. 30, 2017 — the Department of Health and Human Services, which administers Medicare, reported ""improper payments"" for Medicare of $52 billion. He noted that the figure could include payments that were a result of fraud, but that there are no reliable estimates of fraud in Medicare. The figure for fiscal year 2018, Badoyan told us, is $48.5 billion. Now to ""waste"" vs. ""improper payments."" Under federal law, an improper payment is one ""that should not have been made or that was made in an incorrect amount, including overpayments and underpayments."" These could range from coding errors in the billing process to fraud, such as companies billing Medicare for services that were never provided. Of the $52 billion Ryan alluded to, $45 billion consisted of overpayments and $7 billion, underpayments, Badoyan told us. So, that was money ""wasted,"" in the general sense of the word, in that much of it, at least, was spent unnecessarily. Some Medicare experts think the word ""waste"" goes too far. ""I wouldn't call this waste  — some may be, but it is difficult to tell,"" said Joseph J. Doyle Jr., a professor of management and applied economics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and faculty director of MIT’s Sloan Initiative for Health Systems Innovation. But other experts said Ryan’s claim is essentially on target, given the common understanding of what waste means. One of them, Malcolm Sparrow, a professor of the practice of public management at Harvard, said that in a general, non-technical sense, Ryan’s claim is accurate. He added that the audit protocols that Health and Human Services uses to produce the estimates are weak, ""so the actual levels of overall waste, or overpayments, are undoubtedly much higher than these government estimates."" Finally, Joseph Antos, a Medicare expert at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, offered a different view. The real waste, he said, is not what is measured by the improper payment estimates, but Medicare providing services that aren’t necessary, or aren’t delivered well, such as poor follow-up after a patient is hospitalized, resulting in that patient having to return to the hospital. Ryan said: ""There is $50 billion a year wasted in the Medicare program."" The statement is correct in that in the past two years, the federal agency that administers Medicare reports that $52 billion and then $48.5 billion in ""improper payments"" were made  — ranging from payments made with bookkeeping errors to fraud. Ryan goes a bit too far in that some of those payments are underpayments and some were for payments in which there wasn’t sufficient documentation to determine whether the payment was improper. On balance, we rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2019/apr/19/tim-ryan/50-billion-medicare-waste-yes-s-how-much-improper-/
"['Abortion', 'North Carolina', 'Joyce Krawiec']","
Fact check: Are abortion survivors covered by existing laws?
","Some of the rhetoric surrounding a new North Carolina bill gives the impression that laws don’t already protect newborns who survive an abortion. The ""Born Alive Abortion Survivors Protection Act,"" or Senate Bill 359, instructs physicians and nurses to care specifically for newborns who survive an abortion. The proposal includes new punishments for physicians and nurses who don’t comply with the law or who fail to report noncompliance. They could face felony charges, prison time and up to $250,000 in fines. The state House and Senate approved the bill this week, but Gov. Roy Cooper vetoed it Thursday and it remains to be seen whether lawmakers will pass it over his opposition. Democrats have opposed it, saying newborns are already protected and the bill is meant to intimidate medical care providers. Republicans have voiced concern for infants born alive during an abortion. Sen. Joyce Krawiec, a Republican from Kernersville and one of the bill sponsors, said during an April 15 speech on the Senate floor that protections are needed. ""No, we do not have laws in place protecting babies who are born alive as the result of an abortion,"" she said, according to WRAL. Legal experts disagree. MANY PROTECTIONS Legal experts say a range of laws protect newborns regardless of the circumstances of their birth. In other words, newborns are protected even if they enter the world during the course of an abortion. The U.S. Constitution’s Equal Protection Clause and Due Process Clause, state constitutions, and a variety of homicide laws also apply, said Neil Siegel, an attorney and professor at Duke Law School. ""If you have a baby born alive, it doesn’t matter if it was born from a failed abortion or otherwise … it’s entitled to full constitutional protections,"" Siegel said in a phone interview. After the U.S. Senate took up a bill with the same name, PolitiFact addressed this topic in an in-depth story and fact check of President Donald Trump. Experts pointed to the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, first passed in 1974 and subsequently revised, including major updates in the 1980s. The relevant portion of the law makes certain types of federal funding for states conditional on their adoption of policies to prevent improper withholding of treatment from newborns, including those with disabilities. The newborns are also protected under the ""Born-Alive Infants Protection Act"" of 2002. The act defines ""born alive"" to mean: ""the complete expulsion or extraction"" from a mother ""at any stage of development,"" regardless of whether they were extracted during an ""induced abortion."" The 2002 act, however, didn’t directly create civil or criminal penalties. It is ""toothless and purely symbolic,"" said Dwight Duncan, a University of Massachusetts law professor who serves on the the boards of the Pro-Life Legal Defense Fund and Massachusetts Citizens for Life. Filling that omission was a key motivator for supporters of the bill introduced in Washington earlier this year. INTENDED TO CLARIFY Krawiec didn’t respond to a PolitiFact email seeking comment. Bill D’Elia, a spokesman for Senate leader Phil Berger, acknowledged that there are relevant laws already on the books. ""Under current state law, an intentional killing of a baby is covered by our murder statutes and a killing of an unborn baby is covered by the Unborn Victims of Violence Act, but there is no current statute that covers deliberately withholding care to a child born alive during an abortion,"" D’Elia said. ""In theory, a medical professional could be charged with manslaughter for withholding care but it is not explicit in current state law,"" D’Elia said. But, he added, SB 359 makes it ""clear."" Greg Doucette, a criminal defense and business litigation attorney based in Durham, said existing state laws would likely apply to doctors who withhold care. ""If a parent doesn’t feed their newborn and it dies, they get charged with murder. I don’t see why a medical provider would be substantively different,"" Doucette said. OUR RULING On the Senate floor, Krawiec said ""we do not have laws in place protecting babies who are born alive as the result of an abortion."" That’s not true. There are federal and state laws that protect infants as soon as they emerge from their mother’s womb — regardless of the circumstances. We rate her claim False.

An unexpected $400 expense would be damaging for many, but Kamala Harris overstates report’s finding
","On the 2020 presidential campaign trail, California Sen. Kamala Harris often describes the economic hardships faced by American families. She cites statistics on the cost of housing, college, healthcare and how, if elected president, her policies would lessen the burden. Harris took the same approach while speaking on the Pod Save America podcast this week, where she made this claim about economic instability: ""It's clear in our country right now, almost half of American families are a $400 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval."" We’ve seen similar versions of this claim before and wanted to know whether Harris’ statement was accurate. We set out on a fact check. Our research In January, PolitiFact rated Mostly True a similar claim by Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz. He claimed in a ""60 Minutes"" interview that ""Over 40 percent of the American people don't have $400 in the bank."" Schultz had relied on a May 2018 Federal Reserve report on the well-being of U.S. Households in 2017. It found that ""Four in 10 adults, if faced with an unexpected expense of $400, would either not be able to cover it or would cover it by selling something or borrowing money."" Those findings generally support Harris’ contention of ""almost half of American families"" facing hardship with a $400 cost. A Harris campaign spokeswoman said the senator relied on the Fed report. But we took a deeper look at the survey to examine her contention this would really lead to ""complete upheaval"" for almost half of American families.  What did the survey ask?  Here’s the survey question that led to the finding that 40 percent of adults couldn’t immediately pay for a $400 unforeseen cost. ""EF3. Suppose that you have an emergency expense that costs $400. Based on your current financial situation, how would you pay for this expense? If you would use more than one method to cover this expense, please select all that apply. a. Put it on my credit card and pay it off in full at the next statement b. Put it on my credit card and pay it off over time c. With the money currently in my checking/savings account or with cash d. Using money from a bank loan or line of credit e. By borrowing from a friend or family member f. Using a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft g. By selling something"" The findings show that ""59 percent of adults in 2017 said they could easily cover (the $400 expense), using entirely cash, savings or a credit card paid off at the next statement."" Among those who couldn’t easily pay it, 43 percent said they would put it on a credit card and pay it off over time; 26 percent reported they would borrow from a friend or family member; 19 percent said they would sell something; 9 percent responded that they would use a bank loan or line of credit; 5 percent said they would use a payday loan, deposit advance, or overdraft; and 4 percent said they would fined an undefined or ""other"" way to pay. And 29 percent said they ""would not be able to pay the expense right now."" Respondents were able to select multiple answers. SOURCE: U.S. Federal Reserve, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2017, May 2018 Experts weigh in  Daniel Schneider, a UC Berkeley sociology professor whose research specialties include economic instability, reviewed Harris’ statement, along with the survey and its findings. ""I think it is an open question about how those other options … map with ‘complete upheaval’. Is putting something on your credit card to pay off over time ‘complete upheaval’? Maybe,"" he wrote in an email. ""One could certainly imagine that facing an expense shock and having to resort to (those options) would be stressful."" The ""overall idea"" behind Harris’ statement is accurate, Abdur Chowdhury, an economics professor emeritus at Marquette University told us in an email. Chowdhury added, however, that the percentage of people who face a hardship due to a $400 unanticipated cost ""may be lower today. The survey, from which the figure was quoted, was conducted a few years ago."" ""With the low unemployment rate and increases in wage rate, fewer people are in that 'close to bankruptcy' category,"" the professor added. A spokeswoman for the Harris campaign provided a written statement: ""Millions of hard-working Americans can't cover an unexpected $400 expense. They are a medical bill, a car repair, or a rent increase away from having to make painful choices like turning to a neighbor hat in hand to ask for a loan, putting themselves in spiraling credit card debt, selling their car, or heading to a pawn shop with their wedding ring. To presume any of these things would not upend someone's daily life is out of touch."" Our rating Sen. Kamala Harris recently claimed: ""It's clear in our country right now, almost half of American families are a $400 unexpected expense away from complete upheaval."" The portion of Harris’ statement about ""almost half"" of families is on the right track. A 2018 Federal Reserve report found 40 percent of adults surveyed could not easily pay for an unforeseen $400 cost. But the report doesn’t describe ""complete upheaval"" for that group. Instead, it found many would place that expense on a credit card and pay it off over time, borrow money from a friend or family or sell a possession. Those represent very real hardships for families.

No infant has been reported 'born alive' after an abortion in Texas
","Following the lead of Republicans in Congress, Texas lawmakers are looking to enact civil penalties for doctors who don’t provide medical care in cases where a baby is born alive after an attempted abortion. Lawmakers in the statehouse gave initial approval to the legislation on Wednesday by a vote of 93-1, with 50 Democrats registered as ""present, not voting"" in protest of the bill. The Texas Senate approved a similar bill last week. Rep. Donna Howard, D-Austin, criticized what she called a ""blatantly false, inflammatory and dangerous bill."" ""There have been zero reported instances of any child born alive after an abortion in Texas,"" she said from the House floor. Supporters of the proposal argue that it is necessary and that, in rare cases, infants do survive abortion attempts. So is Howard right? State data supports Howard Jacob Cottingham, Howard’s chief of staff, said her statement is based on data available through the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, which tracks different abortion statistics. Health care providers who perform abortions have been required since 2013 to submit data about complications to the commission, which includes data about infants born alive following an attempted abortion. There were no reported instances of this happening in Texas between 2013 and 2016, the most recent year with publicly available data. The data includes information about complications during abortion procedures performed on Texas residents, including those that happened out of state. However, these complications are not identified individually, only in bulk. From 2013 to 2016, the number of unspecified complications experienced by Texas residents during abortions in other states ranged from 417 to 1,347 each year. Howard’s claim was about reported cases of infants born alive after attempted abortions within the state of Texas, so we did not dig deeper into these numbers. How can a baby be born alive after an abortion? Texas law currently details the ""rights of a living child after an abortion or premature birth"" in statute, stating that any child in this category is ""entitled to the same rights, powers, and privileges as are granted by the laws of this state to any other child born alive after the normal gestation period."" Under the law, a baby is considered ""born alive"" if it is removed from its mother following an attempted abortion and then breathes or shows other signs of life, including having a heartbeat, pulsation of the umbilical cord or ""definite movement of voluntary muscles."" The legislation Howard spoke against would establish a ""physician-patient relationship"" between the baby and the doctor who performed the attempted abortion and would allow parents to file suit against the doctor. In a letter voicing opposition to the bill, Dr. Karen Swenson, a doctor in Austin representing the Texas District of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said these cases are ""exceedingly rare."" ""Furthermore, the idea that physicians deliver, and then kill or neglect treating, a viable fetus is unfounded and dangerous misinformation,"" she wrote. The proposed bill does not limit protections based on the gestational age of the baby at the time of the abortion, and it requires doctors to offer the same care they would to ""any other child born alive at the same gestational age."" Most abortions in Texas are performed before a fetus is considered viable, or able to survive outside the womb. There are different medical opinions about when a fetus reaches this critical threshold ranging from 24 to 28 weeks post-fertilization. Texas bans abortions after 20 weeks, unless a mother’s life is in danger or there is a severe fetal abnormality. Nationwide, less than 1.3 percent of the 638,169 abortion procedures performed in 2015 occurred after 21 weeks, according to the CDC. Little nationwide data exists Nationally, there is little anecdotal evidence of a live birth occurring after an attempted abortion and there is no consistent national data about this situation. A report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at infant death certificates from between 2003 and 2014 and identified 143 infants who were born alive after an attempted abortion and died shortly thereafter. This is not a complete count of infants who were born after an attempted abortion, just those who died after birth. The CDC suggests that this number could be an underestimate, given that the agency was attempting to identify deaths that occurred after an induced termination (abortion) versus a spontaneous termination (miscarriage) and in some cases the language describing the situation was unclear. Of those 143 cases, 97 involved a ""maternal complication or, one or more congenital anomalies."" To put this number into context: During the same 12-year period, there were more than 9.3 million abortion procedures performed in the United States in total. Our ruling Howard said, ""There have been zero reported instances of any child born alive after an abortion in Texas."" Health care providers had to start reporting complications from abortion procedures to the state in 2013. We can’t know for certain whether any infants were born alive following an abortion before 2013, but Howard’s claim is limited to those cases that were reported. Since providers had to start reporting this occurance, there have been zero cases. We rate this claim True. TRUE – The statement is accurate and there’s nothing significant missing.",/factchecks/2019/apr/18/donna-howard/no-infant-has-been-reported-born-alive-after-abort/

Initiative petitions were filed at record highs in 2018. Experts explain why
","A slew of Republican-backed bills aiming to toughen the process for Missourians to change the state’s Constitution have sparked strong pushback from some Democrats, who worried the bills would undermine voters’ right to amend the Missouri Constitution. Supporters such as Sen. Eric Burlison, R-Battlefield, however, argue that the current petition filing process needs more restriction. Burlison is sponsoring Senate Joint Resolution 11, which didn’t gain much steam after its first hearing compared to similar bills. The bill would require petitioners to gather signatures from all eight congressional districts in Missouri. Burlison said during the hearing that his bill ""seeks to fix what is very quickly becoming a problem in Missouri — initiative petitions and referendums are being filed at record highs. So far this year 42 have been filed; in 2018, 371 were filed."" We decided to take a look at the numbers. Is it true that petitions and referendums are filed at ""record highs?"" If so, what should we make of the numbers? Burlison’s staff pointed to the Missouri Secretary of State’s office as his data source. His numbers checked out. As of Feb. 13, the date he made the statement, 42 petitions were filed for the 2020 election cycle. In 2018, a total of 371 initiative petitions were filed, the most over the past 12 years, according to data from the Missouri Secretary of State’s office. Source: Missouri Secretary of State The number of petitions filed rose steadily for the most time between 2006 and 2012, the data shows. It began to rise at a higher rate after a slight downturn from 2012 to 2014. However, the number of petitions approved for circulation climbed at a much slower rate. The number of measures that made it to the ballot largely remained flat over the years. For a petition to reach the ballot, petitioners need to first file proposed initiative petitions with the state Secretary of State’s office for review and approval for circulation. After earning permission to circulate a petition, they can then begin gathering signatures to put the measure on the ballot. Under current law, petitioners need to gather signatures from a certain percentage of legal voters in any six of all eight congressional districts in Missouri. For those seeking statutory changes, that number is 5 percent; for constitutional changes, it is 8 percent. Only petitions that hit the mark with enough verified signatures can be placed on the ballot. The measure will need a simple majority of the votes cast in the election to finally become law. Former Missouri Solicitor General James Layton said the rise in the number of petitions filed could be due to petitioners filing variations of a same measure. ""They don’t go out and get signatures, they just pick one of (them)...and they gather signatures as to that one,"" Layton said. ""The change is because the people who do use it are delaying their commitment to a particular format,"" Layton said. As a result, many of the filed petitions are left ""by the wayside,"" he said. Missouri Secretary of State Jay Ashcroft expressed support to toughen the initiative petition process, the Kansas City Star reported. Referring to the number of petitions filed with his office, Ashcroft argued that although he doesn’t want to deter Missourians from placing measures on the ballot, the current process has spiraled out of control. Layton said the increasing number of petitions does add to the workload of the Secretary of State’s office, since it takes ""a fair amount of manpower"" to review the materials. Chuck Hatfield, former chief of staff and counsel to Missouri Attorney General Jay Nixon, said there are petitions filed to just ""make a point."" Hatfield said the increase of petitions over the years reflects a growing awareness of the initiative petition process. Apart from petitioners with experience, he said newcomers are also filing and learning about the process. Hatfield said he also noticed a growing number of petitions coming from ""the more liberal end of the spectrum"" over the years, which he thinks is in response to the rise of Republican control of the state legislature. ""I think the initiative has always been a way for people to respond when they don’t think the legislature is doing what they want them to do,"" Hatfield said. Why isn’t there an uptick in the number of petitions that were placed on the ballot each election cycle? Both Hatfield and Layton said it is hard for petitioners to place measures on the ballot under the current law, especially during the signature gathering process. ""You have to gather thousands of these ... many more than the Constitution requires, because some of them are going to get thrown out"" for various reasons, Layton said. ""If it requires 5,000 signatures in a congressional district, to be safe, you probably want to have 7,000 or 8,000 signatures in that district."" Missouri now has less congressional districts than before, Layton said, which also added to the difficulty of signature gathering to some extent. Hatfield thinks the current law ""strikes the right balance."" Under the current law, only ideas with a wide range of grassroots support or financial backing have a chance at the ballot. ""It’s not like everybody who gets approved to circulate goes and gathers the signatures and has an easy time out of it,"" Hatfield said. ""The other thing to keep in mind is, they don’t all pass."" Burlison said SJR 11 ""seeks to fix what is very quickly becoming a problem in Missouri — initiative petitions and referendums are being filed at record highs."" The numbers he gave to support his statement are accurate. Last year Missouri witnessed the highest amount of petitions filed per election cycle over the past 12 years. However, the statement leaves out the context that the number of petitions that were approved to circulate did not rise proportionately, and the number of ballot measures remained flat over the years.

No, Donald Trump did not say in ‘The Art of the Deal’ that ‘being an atheist’ helped him in business
","An inflammatory quotation about atheism and Christianity appears to pit President Donald Trump against evangelicals. But the resurfaced social media meme is not true. A post on Facebook displays the front cover of Trump’s 1987 book ""The Art of the Deal,"" spotlighting an excerpt that purportedly says, ""Being an atheist gives me an edge in every deal. Christians are too moral for business."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The quote is made up. We could find no passage in multiple searches of electronic versions of ""The Art of the Deal"" that contains those words, or anything close to it. The book is particularly devoid of religious terms. While the Trump quote is made up, a quote from a New York Times review included along the bottom of the meme is real: ""Trump makes one believe for a moment in the American dream again."" It comes from a Dec. 7, 1987, review by Christopher Lehmann-Haupt and has been featured on the front cover of some editions of the book. This isn’t the first time Trump has been called an atheist. During the 2016 presidential campaign, memes popped up that claimed he once said he was an atheist on the Phil Donahue Show in 1989. That rumor was quickly debunked, as there was not only no record of Trump every saying that, he also did not appear on Donahue’s show in 1989. The image was actually from his appearance on The Oprah Winfrey Show in 1988 (and he didn’t claim to be an atheist during that interview, either). A Facebook post claims that in his book ""The Art of the Deal,"" Trump said ""being an atheist give me an edge in every deal. Christians are too moral for business."" Those words could not be found anywhere in the business book and appear to be fabricated.

Has the Affordable Care Act given 200,000-plus West Virginians health coverage?
","During the 2018 midterm elections, many Democrats across the country argued that they would be better positioned than their Republican rivals to protect Americans’ health insurance provided under the Affordable Care Act. The 2018 election cycle may be over now, but the West Virginia Democratic Party continues to make that argument. In fact, the issue gained new relevance in March 2019 when the Trump administration said it has decided to seek the law’s full repeal in an ongoing court case. (This is the same lawsuit that West Virginia Attorney General Patrick Morrisey signed on to, as we’ve noted.) In an April 1 tweet, the state party said that President Donald Trump ""is threatening to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act that provided over 200,000 West Virginians with healthcare coverage. Our seniors depend on it for affordable prescriptions and pre-existing condition coverage."" Trump is threatening to overturn the entire Affordable Care Act that provided over 200,000 West Virginians with healthcare coverage. Our Seniors depend on it for affordable prescriptions and pre-existing condition coverage. pic.twitter.com/TlfCxICCvh Here, we’ll look at whether the party is correct that ""over 200,000 West Virginians with healthcare coverage."" (The West Virginia Democratic Party did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) The Affordable Care Act provides two primary ways to get coverage -- individual policies purchased on online marketplaces and an expansion of Medicaid to a wider group of eligible Americans. We turned to data on both types from the Kaiser Family Foundation. For 2019, the number of West Virginians purchasing health insurance on the marketplace totaled 22,599. And for fiscal year 2017, West Virginia added 183,100 residents to its Medicaid rolls due to the Affordable Care Act. (Kaiser communications director Craig Palosky said 2017 figures are the most recent available due to state-by-state reporting lags.) Combined, that works out to 205,699 West Virginia residents securing coverage from the law, making the Democratic tweet accurate. Palosky added that other West Virginians benefited from the law without specifically securing insurance under the law. For instance, the law required coverage of pre-existing conditions and provided more generous coverage of prescription drugs under Medicare. The West Virginia Democratic Party said the Affordable Care Act ""provided over 200,000 West Virginians with health care coverage."" The combination of insurance purchases on the marketplace and the increase in Medicaid coverage works out to 205,699, according to the most recent data available.

"['Taxes', 'New York', 'Andrew Cuomo']","
Cuomo’s claim not the case for most NY taxpayers
","Gov. Andrew Cuomo’s complaints about a provision in the 2017 federal tax law have intensified in recent months. The provision caps the federal deduction for state and local tax payments at $10,000. ""As governor of the state of New York today, my top priority is repealing SALT. Period,"" Cuomo told reporters in March, referring to the cap on state and local tax deductions in the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The effect of the $10,000 cap on SALT deductions is widespread in New York, Cuomo said.   ""Fifty-two counties have average taxes of above the SALT $10,000 cap,"" Cuomo said at his March news conference. ""Fifty-two counties will see a tax increase."" We wondered if his rhetoric around the issue is accurate. Is the problem with the cap as widespread as he said? Do 52 counties have average state and local taxes above the $10,000 cap? Cuomo has repeated this claim several times, and a report from the Office of the State Comptroller appears to be his source. In October 2017, while changes to the tax law were under discussion but before they were passed, Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli released a report on how the changes could affect New York. One of the proposals DiNapoli’s office analyzed was the proposal in Washington to eliminate or reduce the federal deduction for state and local taxes. ""This is a big deal for our state: New Yorkers reported more than $72 billion in deductions for income and property taxes in 2015,"" DiNapoli wrote. Of that total, income taxes accounted for $51.7 billion and property taxes for $20.9 billion.   The Office of Comptroller found that filers who claimed state and local tax deductions had an average deduction of more than $10,000 in 52 of New York’s 62 counties, according to its analysis of county-by-county data from the Internal Revenue Service’s Statistics of Income program from the 2015 tax year. The most recent IRS data, released from the 2016 tax year, showed average deductions above $10,000 in 53 counties.  We asked some tax experts about Cuomo’s claim. Several noted that many tax filers do not itemize their deductions, and that Cuomo’s claim about ""average taxes above the cap"" fails to convey this point. ""Only 34.8 percent of New Yorkers took the state and local tax deduction in 2016; the governor is claiming that average taxes in these counties are over $10,000 based on the taxes of a little over one-third of the population -- generally speaking, the wealthiest one-third,"" said Jared Walczak, a senior policy analyst at the nonpartisan Tax Foundation. Walczak found that the average state and local taxes across all filers was above $10,000 in only three counties: Westchester, New York and Nassau. Even if it’s not relevant for SALT deduction purposes, filers who don’t itemize have state and local tax liabilities, too, so the average would be over $10,000 in a handful of other counties, such as Putnam, Rockland and Suffolk counties, Walczak said. Tax experts also noted that averages can be skewed by a few very high earners. ""To put this in context: 81.5 percent of New York filers have an adjusted gross income of $100,000 or less, and they pay an average of $2,840 in federal income taxes. Yet the average federal income tax liability for a New York filer is $13,896, skewed upward by the highest earners,"" Walczak said. ""Similarly, the vast majority of New York filers are well below the SALT deduction cap, and in many cases aren't deducting state and local taxes at all.""       If Cuomo’s implication is that taxes will go up because of the cap on SALT, ""of course, most of those people still get a tax cut because of TCJA,"" said Steve Wamhoff, director of federal tax policy at the left-leaning Institute of Taxation and Economic Policy. We asked the governor’s office about the issues with his claim that 52 counties have average state and local taxes above $10,000. ""The facts remain the same: The federal government values the cap on SALT deductions at more than $600 billion over the next decade; and New Yorkers will pay $15 billion more to the federal government annually, taking more from New York than any other State,"" said Freeman Klopott, spokesman for the Division of Budget. ""The bottom line is this is a tax increase for our state to benefit the federal government that unfairly attacks New York, which is already the top contributor to the federal government."" PolitiFact New York has fact-checked a claim that New York gives more to the federal treasury than the state gets back, and found it to be True. In making a case to repeal the $10,000 cap on state and local tax deductions, Cuomo said that in 52 counties the average amount of state and local taxes exceeded the cap. The latest data available, from 2016, before the new tax law was implemented, show that in 53 counties, the average state and local tax deduction was greater than $10,000, when the average is calculated using returns from filers who claimed that deduction -- not from every filer. He bases his statement on the taxes paid by about one-third of the population, generally the more affluent one-third. Cuomo's statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression about how severe the cap is for most New Yorkers. He makes it seem the cap's effect is more widespread than it is. We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2019/apr/17/andrew-cuomo/cuomo-claims-tax-change-bad-ny/

Facebook posts wrongly claim photo shows 'Muslims laughing while Notre Dame is burning'
","Correction and update May 28, 2019: A previous version of this fact-check said that the photo of the two men was manipulated based on the analysis of a photo forensics expert. That determination has since been challenged by other photo forensics experts who say the image is authentic. French publisher AFP has since published a story quoting the men appearing in the photo. The men did not challenge the image's authenticity. We can no longer support the claim that the photo has been manipulated, and have removed that suggestion from this fact-check. The rating of the fact-check, which analyzes the claim that two Muslims were laughing as Notre Dame burned, remains Pants on Fire. The updated story is below.  You can read more about the reporting of this story in a separate report. As Notre Dame burned in Paris, images of people grieving while they watched a fire damage the iconic cathedral started to populate social media feeds. ""It is like losing a member of one’s own family,"" one man told the New York Times, which reported onlookers were gasping, covering their mouths in horror and wiping away tears. But one image being shared on Facebook, among other platforms, is an image of two men who appear to be smiling as they duck under police tape with Notre Dame in flames behind them. ""Muslims laughing while Notre Dame is burning…"" said one account that posted the photo to Facebook on April 15. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) That’s because posters didn’t  know anything about the men in the photo—what they’re doing and if they are Muslim, notably. Searching for the picture online, we found it posted on the website of Sputnik, a news site run by the Russian government. The image of the men, which has a Sputnik copyright symbol below it, is part of a 9:29 p.m. update about the fire that says ""evacuation underway at Notre Dame Cathedral, Paris’ Ile de la Cite."" The post includes no description or caption information for the men, nor does it describe their attitude or religion. That image then spread across the internet, where others used it to support claims that the cathedral fire was a terrorist attack and fueled anti-Muslim rhetoric. The photo appeared on the website Red White and F You! With Mindy Robinson, which featured a story on the top of its homepage April 16 titled, ""Notre Dame Cathedral is Burning...and the Media refuses to state the obvious (it’s terrorism)."" (The fire’s cause is under investigation but still unknown.) ""Laughing and smiling,"" Robinson writes about the image with the men. ""Man, I sure do wonder what specific group of people stood to gain from all this #heavyMFsarcasm."" One Twitter user described them as ""Extremist Muslims.""   But another Twitter user reached out to @HoaxEye about the image. The account is run by Janne Ahlberg from Finland, according to the Twitter bio, with the aim of debunking hoaxes. The tagline of the HoaxEye website: ""A fake image is worth zero words.""   When the user asked Ahlberg about the photo, Ahlberg replied, ""Saying that this is a photo of persons ‘laughing while Notre Dame is on fire’ is just appalling. (As far as I know) we don’t know yet anything about these persons, situation etc."" In a statement, Sputnik said ""The men seen in the photograph are not mentioned once throughout the article and are of no relevance at all to the story. That other news organisations should seek to find an alternative meaning to this picture is the very definition of fake news.

Fact-checking Tulsi Gabbard's attack on new Trump policy for pork inspections, E. coli testing
","Democratic presidential candidate Tulsi Gabbard suggested Americans are at risk of eating contaminated pork because of President Donald Trump’s regulatory cuts. ""Trump’s effort to rollback regulations means that Big Ag now gets to inspect its own pork - & they decided to stop testing for E. coli. This endangers everyone, even if you don’t eat pork, because bacteria can easily spread on shared surfaces. This is swamp politics at its worst,"" said an April 8 tweet by Gabbard, a congresswoman from Hawaii. Trump’s effort to rollback regulations means that Big Ag now gets to inspect its own pork - & they decided to stop testing for E. coli. This endangers everyone, even if you don’t eat pork, because bacteria can easily spread on shared surfaces. This is swamp politics at its worst. There’s an element of truth to her claim: A government proposal would change the process for inspecting swine, and some consumer advocacy groups argue it will give greater control to the pork industry. But Gabbard stretches the facts by saying companies will be the ones doing the inspections. It’s more nuanced than that. The proposal does allow plants to stop testing carcasses for E. coli (the tests are done to monitor sanitation and process control). However, there would be a new testing requirement for the same purpose. Gabbard’s campaign did not respond to PolitiFact’s requests for comment. The U.S. Department of Agriculture’s Food Safety and Inspection Service is tasked with inspecting meat, poultry and processed egg products so they are safe to eat. The agency in February 2018 proposed changing the animal inspection process at plants that slaughter pigs raised for meat. The proposal would require plant employees to sort animals showing signs of disease or other conditions from the animals that appear to be healthy. Currently, plants do this sorting voluntarily and at the direction of agency inspectors. The inspectors are there to guide the process. But sorting is different from inspecting, and federal inspections would still happen, the agency said. The sorting of acceptable and unacceptable hogs happens before a USDA veterinarian ultimately inspects the animal. Under the proposal, government veterinarians would still be the ones inspecting animals before they are slaughtered. The proposal would also require hog plant employees to trim and identify defects on carcasses and parts before an agency inspector does a post-mortem examination. Under current regulations, plant workers are not required to do post-mortem sorting — it only happens after an agency inspector directs them to do so and after the inspector does an initial sorting, the proposed rule said. Plant employees who sort animals would be the first set of eyes checking a carcass, and government inspectors would be the second set of eyes doing a thorough inspection, said Sarah Schieck, who as an educator at the University of Minnesota Swine Extension provides research-based education and resources to pig farmers. There are around 600 plants in the United States that slaughter swine. But the government expects that only 35 (beyond five in a pilot program) are likely to adopt the proposed voluntary New Swine Slaughter Inspection System, because they share characteristics of the plants in the pilot. Plants that don’t switch can continue operating under the traditional inspection model. The food safety agency said it is reviewing public comments and in the process of writing the final rule. The government proposed removing a requirement that hog plants test carcasses for generic E. coli. Plants do that testing to monitor their sanitation and process control. Instead of mandating generic E. coli testing, the agency wants to allow plants ""to develop sampling plans that are more tailored"" to their specific location and that better monitor their process control. It recommended testing for aerobic plate count, which is ""less specific than generic E. coli,"" the agency’s draft guideline said. (Plants could also choose to continue testing for generic E. coli.) A shift to aerobic plate count testing wouldn’t pose a greater health risk for consumers, food safety experts told PolitiFact. ""It is reasonable to test for the largest group of microbes one can, because that will be the most sensitive to pick up a breakdown in sanitation processes,"" said Matthew Stasiewicz, an assistant professor of applied food safety at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. The Trump administration is moving forward on the proposal, but this isn’t a rushed change it initiated. Plans and data gathering began in the 1990s under the Clinton administration, and there was a 20-year pilot program in five hog establishments, the agency said. Similar changes were approved and implemented for poultry inspections during the Obama years, experts said. Still, consumer advocates aren’t applauding the proposed changes for the pork industry. It matters if plant workers are the ones sorting animals, because ""workers can’t safely speak up to protect consumers,"" said Amanda L. Hitt, director of public health and director of the Food Integrity Campaign at the Government Accountability Project. ""Unlike inspectors, workers cannot safely blow the whistle on public health violations."" Jaydee Hanson, policy director for the Center for Food Safety, also pointed to a 2013 audit from the USDA’s office of inspector general that found the agency ""did not adequately oversee"" the swine pilot program and could not determine whether the program goals of increasing food safety and plant efficiency were met. A separate 2013 report from the Government Accountability Office also said that the pilot program ""would not provide reasonable assurance that any conclusions can apply more broadly"" to the estimated 600 hog plants in the country, because of the small sample size. Gabbard tweeted, ""Trump’s effort to rollback regulations means that Big Ag now gets to inspect its own pork - & they decided to stop testing for E. coli."" The Trump administration is advancing a proposal that has been in development for decades. Some consumer advocacy groups are concerned that the changes will create safety risks. The proposal allows hog plants to opt-in to a new inspection system, under which plant workers (and not federal regulators) would sort animals for inspection. However, sorting is not the same as inspecting. The food safety agency would still be the one inspecting hogs. The proposal eliminates a requirement that plants test carcasses for generic E. coli, testing that’s done to track sanitation and process control. But the government would still require monitoring of process control and recommends other testing that experts said would be a greater food safety measure. (Establishments could also choose to continue testing for E. coli.) Overall, Gabbard’s tweet is misleading and doesn’t tell the whole picture.

State Rep. Stubbs hits target with claim on Wisconsin's black infant mortality rate
","Gov. Tony Evers’ budget includes proposals on a smorgasbord of issues, from legalizing medical marijuana, to boosting the minimum wage and helping homeowners replace lead pipes. The governor, a Democrat, also included $28 million in new funding for the ""Healthy Women, Healthy Babies"" initiative. Republican lawmakers have balked at that proposal, mainly because it includes a provision to restore Planned Parenthood funding blocked under former Gov. Scott Walker. Democratic lawmakers held a news conference on March 12, 2019 to support the initiative, with state Rep. Shelia Stubbs, D-Madison, highlighting racial disparities in the state’s infant mortality rate. ""Wisconsin (has) the highest infant mortality rate for black babies nationwide,"" Stubbs declared. Is she right? The evidence When asked for backup, Stubbs cited a 2018 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report. The report, which uses data from 2013-2015, states: ""For infants of non-Hispanic black women, the mortality rate ranged from 8.27 in Massachusetts to 14.28 in Wisconsin."" ""The data should be shocking to everyone,"" Stubbs said in an email. ""But for Black families, especially Black women, this is reality. It is past time these stories are heard so we can address this traumatic and heartbreaking truth."" The CDC defines infant mortality as the death of an infant before his or her first birthday. The infant mortality rate is the number of infant deaths for every 1,000 live births. As Stubbs noted, Wisconsin does appear at the top of the CDC list when it comes to infant mortality for non-Hispanic black women, with the following deaths per 1,000 live births: Wisconsin -- 14.28 Ohio -- 13.46 Alabama -- 13.40 Indiana -- 13.26 North Carolina -- 12.24 For non-Hispanic white women, the picture shifts: Arkansas -- 7.04 West Virginia -- 7.02 Mississippi -- 6.91 Oklahoma -- 6.86 Kentucky and Alabama -- 6.44 Wisconsin came in at 4.71 deaths per 1,000 live births for non-Hispanic white women, slightly lower than the U.S. rate of 4.95. What about the overall picture? That is, babies of all races? According to the Wisconsin Department of Health Services’ annual Birth and Infant Mortality Report 2016, released in July 2018: -- 415 infants under the age of one year died in 2016. -- The overall infant mortality rate was 6.2 infant deaths per 1,000 births, up from 5.7 in 2015. In Wisconsin, the infant mortality rate -- especially among black mothers -- is driven by what happens in the City of Milwaukee. In Milwaukee, experts cite stress during pregnancy as a major factor in premature births, which itself is a cause of infant mortality. The ZIP codes with the highest infant mortality rates in Milwaukee are also in the most impoverished areas and have the highest concentration of minorities living there, according to the Milwaukee Health Department’s 2017 Fetal Infant Mortality Review report. ""In the four year period of 2012 through 2015, the city of Milwaukee recorded 390 infant deaths and 262 stillbirths,"" the report said. ""This represents about 98 infant deaths per year and about 66 stillbirths per year during this time period. Data from 2015 alone indicate that while the city of Milwaukee had 15% of all births in the state of Wisconsin, it also had a quarter (24.7%) of all infant deaths in the state, and 21.8% of all the stillbirths in the state."" According to City of Milwaukee data, the city’s overall mortality rate in 2017 was 12.6 deaths per 1,000 live births. The racial breakdown: Black -- 18.4 Asian -- 11.4 Hispanic -- 8.9 White -- 3.6 So, what’s being done? Last week, Milwaukee regained a five-year, $5 million federal grant to combat the problem — a grant Milwaukee lost five years ago. In 2017, Milwaukee's Westlawn neighborhood was added to a list of communities being aided by Best Babies Zone, a national effort to reduce racial disparities in infant death rates. Meanwhile, the Lifecourse Initiative for Healthy Families is a regional program to support African American women and their families to have healthy births. It is aimed at reducing the disparity in birth outcomes between African Americans and whites. On April 2, 2019, Mayor Tom Barrett signed legislation creating a joint pilot program with the Milwaukee County Department of Health and Human Services to provide doulas to 100 expectant mothers in the 53206 ZIP code. 2017 data shows that 53206 tops the city’s infant mortality list, with the highest rates generally concentrated on the city’s economically distressed north and northwest sides: 53206 -- 29.1 53225 -- 26.5 53210 -- 20.6 53212 -- 17.6 53216 -- 15.2 Doulas are certified professionals trained to support expectant mothers’ nutritional, physical and mental health. Nearly all of them emphasize prenatal nutrition, breastfeeding, safe sleeping habits and stress reduction techniques. ""A healthy city starts with healthy moms and babies,"" Barrett said during a bill signing event at Canaan Missionary Baptist Church. The program, advocated by Ald. Khalif Rainey and Milwaukee County Supervisor Marina Dimitrijevic, will be funded with up to $100,000 from Milwaukee County. Evers’ plan also includes grant funding for doula training and Medicaid coverage for doula services.
