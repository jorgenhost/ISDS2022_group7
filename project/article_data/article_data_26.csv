Donald Trump said European nations have not put money into Ukraine. They have put in a lot
","In a scrum with reporters outside the U.N. General Assembly hall, President Donald Trump was asked why he held up at least $250 million in military aid to Ukraine shortly before his July phone call with Ukraine’s president that has now triggered a House impeachment inquiry. ""My complaint has always been — and I’d withhold again, and I’ll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine,"" Trump said Sept. 24. ""Because they’re not doing it. Just the United States. We’re putting up the bulk of the money. And I’m asking, why is that."" Have Europe and other countries failed to contribute to Ukraine? No. While the United States has taken the lead on military aid, the Europeans, Japan and Canada have borne the brunt of economic and government restructuring aid to bolster Ukraine. After 2014, the European Union and its financial assistance agencies put together $15 billion mainly in loans but also in direct grants to Ukraine. Spokeswoman Maja Kocijancic told PolitiFact in statement that described it as ""the largest support package in the history of the European Union."" The package includes over 2 billion euros in grants, 49 million euros to monitor the truce in Eastern Ukraine, and a 3.5 billion euros loan package to develop and restore the county’s banking, agriculture and transportation systems.  Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development data shows that in 2016-2017, the European Union provided $425 million in development aid, with the United States spending $204 million, Germany $189 million and Japan $180 million. ""The Europeans did a whole lot more than the United States in terms of actual cash put into the Ukrainian budget,"" said Samuel Charap, a Ukraine analyst with RAND, a nonprofit research organization. In contrast, the United States has done the heavy lifting on military aid. In the past five years, Security Assistance Monitor, a nonprofit group, has tracked nearly $1.5 billion in defense aid to Ukraine. Steven Pifer, a former U.S. ambassador to Ukraine and who served in the State Department in the George W. Bush years, described a de facto division of labor. ""The United States provides more military assistance, while Europe provides significant reform assistance,"" Pifer said. ""Both are necessary to bolster the country’s security."" Individual European nations have done some work on the military side.  Charap noted that the United Kingdom, Canada, Poland and other countries have sent military supplies and hundreds of trainers. Chiefly, though, he said, they have worked through NATO. In 2014, at the Welsh Summit, NATO member states established five new trust funds to help Ukraine’s military, with a budget of 10 million Euros. It later created a sixth fund. Generally, Charap said, Europe has been cautious with direct military aid. ""The Europeans and particularly the Germans did not want to get involved in a proxy war,"" he said. Charap also said it was easier for Europe to bolster Ukraine’s civilian institutions. ""The Europeans have more mechanisms for nonmilitary assistance through their extensive development work in Ukraine,"" Charap said. Trump said the Europeans are not contributing to Ukraine and that only the United States is. In terms of military aid, the statement overlooks that NATO and individual European nations have spent over 10 million euros on equipment and training to help Ukraine’s military. However, the United States has provided the lion’s share of military aid. Where the statement strays widely from the facts is on the nonmilitary side. There, the countries of Europe, individually and through multilateral European bodies, have done much more for Ukraine than the United States. The foreign policy experts we reached said both kinds of aid are necessary for Ukraine’s security. We rate this claim Mostly False.

Facebook post makes inaccurate claim about deportation of white immigrants
","A popular yet unsubstantiated Facebook post claims that the United States has not detained, let alone deported, any white immigrants. ""Since ICE has not deported or detained one white illegal immigrant, which there are 600,000 of...can we admit this is about race?"" said the Aug. 15 post, shared at least 87,000 times as of Sept. 24. A reader wanted to know if it was really true that no white immigrants have been deported by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE. There’s no evidence for that. The Facebook post does not include any sources, and we did not find corresponding news stories or government data to support it.  ICE does not track deportations based on race or ethnicity. The agency has statistics on where people are sent, but that alone doesn’t indicate someone’s race.  Pew Research Center estimated that in 2017 there were 9.75 million unauthorized people ages 18 and older. Of 9.75 million people, about 700,000 were white (not Hispanic), according to Pew. PRI in July 2017 published a story about a man from Ireland deported from the United States for overstaying the length of his visa. The story identifies the deported man, John Cunningham, as a white immigrant. In addition to Cunningham, another man from Ireland who lived in the United States illegally and a representative from Boston's Irish International Immigrant Center, ""all acknowledged that, as white men, they can fly under the radar of those who associate unauthorized immigrants with Mexico and Central America,"" the PRI story said. A year before ICE arrested Cunningham, he told PRI: ""Most people think undocumented and they think people who come across the southern border. They’re not thinking about the Irish guy who lives right next to them. They don’t see that part of it, but we have to live with that every day."" NPR in January 2018 also reported that a then-19-year-old man from Ireland, Dylan O’Riordan, had been detained by ICE and was scheduled to be deported. ""O'Riordan didn't necessarily think being white would save him from deportation orders. He thought staying out of trouble would keep him under the radar. He says other detainees are surprised he was arrested,"" the story said. ICE told NPR that O’Riordan overstayed the terms of his admission. In fiscal year 2018, ICE deported close to 260,000 people. The top three countries where people were deported were Mexico, Guatemala, and Honduras. Hispanics or Latinos (terms used to denote ethnicity) can be of any race, including white.  Overall, in 2018 immigrants were deported to countries all over the world, including Norway, Russia, Ireland, Kenya, and China. (Here’s the full list of countries where immigrants were deported.) The Trump administration says anyone in the country illegally is a priority for deportation. Our ruling A Facebook post said, ""ICE has not deported or detained one white illegal immigrant."" The Facebook post does not include a source for its claim. ICE said it does not track the race of the people it removes from the country. Latin American countries were the top destinations where people were deported to in 2018. Hispanics or Latinos can be of any race, including white. News reports have noted that white immigrants have been detained and deported by ICE during Trump’s presidency.

This photo doesn’t show trash left by climate strike protesters
","It’s estimated that up to 4 million people participated in a global climate strike Sept. 20 to advocate for government action on climate change.

No, the story about 11-year-old girl who shot two ‘illegal aliens’ in Montana is fake
","Did an 11-year-old girl shoot and kill two ""illegal aliens"" during a home invasion in Montana? No. This faux tale is more than 12 years old and continues to resurface on social media even though it’s been debunked several times over the years.  The rumor showed up on Facebook again on Sept. 20 on the page ""Adorable Deplorables for Trump"" and has gotten over 500 comments and more than 1,500 shares.  The post shared an image of a young girl holding a shotgun with text below it that recounts the story: ""11-YEAR-OLD WHO SHOT ILLEGALS. Two illegal aliens, Ralphel Resindez, 23, and Enrico Garza, 26, probably believed they would easily overpower home-alone 11-year-old Patricia Harrington after her father had left their two-story home. It seems these crooks never learned two things: 1. They were in Montana. 2. Patricia had been a clay shooting champion since she was nine...""   The post goes on to say that the girl grabbed a shotgun and killed both men before police were able to arrive and that one of the immigrants had already killed another man during an earlier home invasion. At the end it asks if you ever wonder why ""good stuff"" never makes the news. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) First, a reverse-image search revealed the girl in the photo is actually a 14-year-old from New Jersey who was featured in a piece by the New Yorker about kids who use recreational firearms. And the story about the girl shooting intruders ""never made the news"" because it never actually happened. The account can only be found in other websites that repeat the same information, with no additional details.  A search of the Nexis database surfaced a few stories where young people helped thwart home invasions by using firearms over the years, but none lined up with the post.  We did find a 1988 story of an 11-year-old shooting and killing two burglars – but the child was a boy and the incident took place in Switzer, South Carolina. As well, the men were not named ""Ralphel Resindez"" and ""Enrico Garza,"" but were two ex-convicts named Danny Ray Abernathy and Broadus Petty.  Some earlier versions of the rumor named the Montana town of Butte as being the location of the incident, but a 2007 story by the Montana Standard newspaper, which included an interview with the town’s sheriff, called the shooting ""nothing but an urban myth:"" ""When asked about the authenticity of the events described in this story, Butte-Silver Bow Sheriff John Walsh told The Montana Standard in an earlier interview that his office never investigated such an incident. ‘This never happened,’ Walsh said. The story claims the girl shot and killed the two intruders while she was home alone. The story doesn’t provide a street address or attribute the information to any official sources. Walsh brushed off the story of an urban myth. ‘It’s amazing how these things get around,’ he said."" Phillip Morris, a columnist with The Plain Dealer, wrote a piece about the myth in 2013: ""There was no Ralphel Resindez, there was no Enrico Garza, and despite her elevation to heroine status with some gun rights groups, there was no little girl named Patricia who bravely defended her home with her father's shotgun. So why does this story still circulate? ""Probably, because it seems perfectly believable. For a nation that remains bitterly divided on the issues of immigration and gun control, this violent parable highlights the worst fears of what illegal immigration and stricter gun control could portend for the nation.""

Contrary to Bynum-Coleman's ad , Cox has steadily backed teacher raises
","Democrat Sheila Bynum-Coleman is trying to label Speaker Kirk Cox as opponent of teacher raises in a contentious race for the 66th District House seat. Her first try ran into trouble. ""Cox joined with special interests to deny teachers a raise,"" she said in a TV ad that aired Sept. 4. But a small-print citation Bynum-Coleman used in the ad to back the claim was inaccurate. She cited Cox for a 2013 vote against the state budget with a teacher raise when, actually, he supported it. It was another delegate - John Cox - who opposed the budget. Bynum-Coleman stopped the ad, and put up a new version the next day with the same claim and video, but amended sources. Cox’s campaign says the commercial is still inaccurate. So we fact-checked the second ad to see if Cox, a former teacher, ""joined with special interests to deny teachers a raise."" Cox’s Voting Record Cox joined the General Assembly in 1990. We tracked his voting record on teacher raises from 2005, which is the earliest year Bynum-Coleman cites in her contention that Cox has opposed pay hikes.  Cox, a retired teacher, has been in a strong position to influence teacher pay. From, 2005-2017, he sat on the budget-writing Appropriations Committee, a subcommittee of it that oversaw money going to public schools, and was on a small team of House negotiators who worked out final spending deals with the Senate. He became speaker in 2018. Teacher raises are not singled out for a vote in the General Assembly. They appear as line items in thick state budgets hundreds of pages long. Since 2005, the legislature has approved seven budgets with lasting teacher pay raises, a Cox voted for each one. Here are the raises: *2005, 3%; *2006, 3%; *2007. 3%; *2013, 2%; *2015, 1.5%; *2018, 3%; and *2019, 2%. The state paid half the amount of each raise and localities were responsible for the rest, There were also two times when Cox voted with the General Assembly to pass teacher pay raises and later supported rescinding them before they went into effect because of low state revenues. In 2008, Cox backed a 2% raise to start on July 1, 2009. In early 2009, as the state slid into the Great Recession, Cox voted with the General Assembly to cancel rescind the pay hike. In 2016, he supported a 2% to begin July 1, 2017 if projected state revenues didn’t fall more than 1% below projections. Revenues missed that target and in early 2017 Cox voted with the General Assembly to cancel the raise. Overall, Cox unfailingly voted each year for incremental  versions of the state budget that were passed by the Appropriations Committee, the House, and the full General Assembly. Don’t forget that he had an influential role at each step. Bynum-Coleman’s sources In her amended second ad, Bynum Coleman offers three citations to back her claim that Cox ""joined special interests to deny teachers a raise."" All of them are at least eight years old. Parker Slaybaugh, Cox’s spokesman, said the speaker doesn’t recall any of the incidents. One citation is a 2005 bill that would have established a policy goal to raise Virginia teacher salaries to the national average. The bill, which didn’t set a target date to reach the goal or seek money, passed the Senate. It died in House Appropriations Committee that Cox sat on without being brought up for a vote. There’s no record of any action by Cox on the bill. Rob Silverstein, campaign manager for Bynum-Coleman, said that’s tantamount to Cox opposing raising teacher salaries to the national average. ""He could have moved the bill forward, but he let it die,"" Silverstein said. Slaybaugh said Cox, in 2005, was a junior member of the 22-person committee and wouldn’t have had the sway to advance the bill. He noted that this summer, Cox called for hitting the national pay average in four years. Silverstein dismissed the action as an election-year stunt. Bynum-Coleman also cites a failed 2011 bill as evidence of Cox’s opposition to teacher raises.  It would have allowed local school boards to use unspent funds for a one-time bonus teachers bonus up to 3% of their salaries. The legislation died on an unrecorded voice vote in Cox’s seven-member subcommittee. Bynum-Coleman’s third citation is a confusing editorial that ran in The Virginian-Pilot on Aug. 31, 2008.  It said Cox and two other delegates backed a change in the state school-funding formula ""that would have ended the state’s obligation to pick up a share of supplemental raises awarded by cities and counties.""  What’s baffling is that the state doesn’t have an obligation - now or then - to pay a portion of teacher raises originating in localities. The opposite is true. We found nothing to corroborate the editorial in a search of state newspapers. We asked Silverstein if he knew details about the editorial’s statement. ""The story speaks for itself,"" he said. Special Interests Key to Bynum-Coleman’s ad is her claim that Cox ""joined special interests"" in ""denying"" teacher pay raises. Our legislative memory, dating to 1986, doesn’t recall any organized lobby against teacher raises. The economy has been the driving force: In good times, teachers usually get raises; in tight times, they don’t. We asked Silverstein to identify the special interests. He said he was driving and would get back with an answer. We’re still waiting. Our ruling Bynum-Coleman’s TV ad says ""Cox joined special interests to deny teachers raises.""  She had to temporarily pull the ad because it claimed Cox voted against a 2013 state budget with a teacher raise when, actually he supported it. Bynum-Coleman’s corrected ad offers three citations to back her claim, all of them at least seven years old. Two concern the death of bills in the House Appropriations Committee where Cox was a member, One in 2005, would have set an open-ended  goal to raise teacher salaries to the national average; the other would have let school boards spend surpluses in 2013 for a one-time bonus. The third source is two confusing sentences in a 2008 editorial.  Cox says he doesn’t remember any of these occasions and it would be nice if he did. None of Bynum’s evidence of leads to a recorded vote although Cox, if he followed form, was likely to have gone along with the committee’s Republican majority. And none of her evidence centers on Cox’s actions when there was money on the table for salary increases. There have been seven budgets since 2005 that raised teacher salaries and Cox voted for each one. Two other times, he supported budgets with pay raises, and a year later voted with the General Assembly to rescind them before they took effect because of flagging state revenues. All told, Cox’s record matches the legislature’s since 2005. He voted for nine teacher pay hikes and twice to later cancel them.    Bynum-Coleman offers no proof for her charge Cox joined special interests to stop teacher raises. When you combine this with the erroneous sourcing on her first ad - still posted on her Twitter page - Bynum-Coleman’s full claim is unsubstantiated.  We rate it Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000002809746A900>],/factchecks/2019/sep/24/sheila-bynum-coleman/contrary-bynum-coleman-cox-has-steadily-backed-tea/

McMurray’s illegal immigration claim is only part of the story
","Democrat Nate McMurray, who is campaigning for a second time for the 27th Congressional District seat, made a claim recently about illegal immigration during the Obama administration.  ""Under Barack Obama illegal immigration dropped to a 50-year low (look it up),"" he said in a  post on Twitter.  Under @BarackObama illegal immigration dropped to a 50-year low (look it up).For the first time, we passed a law on pre-existing conditions and near full healthcare coverage. We recovered from a global economic collapse. I could go on. But @JoeBiden was there too. Fighting. Immigration continues to be a topic that Americans care about and candidates talk about, so we wanted to see if McMurray is correct. His instruction to ""look it up"" struck us as an invitation for a factcheck.   What the Grand Island supervisor meant by ""illegal immigration"" remains unclear. His spokesperson did not clarify it for us. Demographers who study immigration look at data from several sources to get a sense of how many people cross the border illegally and how many enter legally but then overstay their visas. They also look at how the population of people who live in the United States without authorization changes over time. That number rises and falls as more undocumented immigrants enter the country while others die, become citizens or leave the country.    McMurray responded to a Twitter user asking for evidence of his claim, and he tweeted the link to a report from the pro-immigration Center for Migration Studies.  In the report, ""The U.S. Undocumented Population Fell Sharply During the Obama Era: Estimates for 2016,"" author Robert Warren found that the population of undocumented people fell to 10.8 million in 2016, Obama's last full year in office, the lowest level since 2003.  The report does not go back 50 years. It does show that the undocumented population was once much lower. Using data on 18 countries that account for 88 percent of the undocumented population, the report shows that in 1990, the undocumented population was 3.5 million, and in 2000 it was 8.6 million.  Another study, from the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, found that the population of unauthorized immigrants peaked in 2007, before Obama took office, at 12.2 million and fell to 10.5 million in 2017, just after he left the presidency.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security uses a different methodology to count the number of unauthorized immigrants, and it estimates that on average, that number grew by 70,000 people every year between 2010 and 2015. DHS estimates that 12 million unauthorized immigrants were living in the United States in January 2015, compared to 11.5 million in January 2014 and 11.6 million in January 2010, according to a report published in December.  We interviewed five people who study immigration trends, some from think tanks with different viewpoints on immigration and others who conduct research but do not take positions on policy. Many of these experts use government data on apprehensions of people who are in the United States without authorization to measure illegal immigration, though they warned that data is not a perfect measure.  The U.S. Department of Homeland Security reports that yearly apprehensions of aliens, which the department defines as people who are not citizens or nationals, was as low as 462,388 under Obama in 2015. The highest number of apprehensions during Obama’s presidency was 889,212 in 2009. This figure includes apprehensions by U.S. Border Patrol and administrative arrests by Immigrations and Customs Enforcement. Before 2015, the department recorded lower apprehensions 44 years earlier. In 1971, 420,126 apprehensions were recorded. After Obama left office, the number of apprehensions fell lower still. In 2017, President Donald Trump’s first year in office, apprehensions fell to 461,540.  The U.S. Border Patrol also reports its yearly apprehensions, which is a subset of the Department of Homeland Security data. Apprehensions at the border during the Obama administration were also lowest in 2015, at 337,117. Before 2015, apprehensions at the border were lower in 1971, with 302,517. In 2017, border apprehensions fell to 310,531.   What is at a 50-year low, according to Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer with the nonpartisan Pew Research Center, is apprehensions of Mexicans at the southwest border. However, Passel said that though apprehensions of Mexicans at the southwest border are falling, research from Pew shows that people who have likely overstayed their visas have made up a large majority of unauthorized immigrant arrivals since 2010. Several demographers warned that apprehensions are only a rough indicator of illegal immigration, and not just because apprehensions do not reveal the precise number of people who crossed the border without permission and stayed. Research published in January from the Center for Migration Studies found ""visa overstays have significantly exceeded illegal border crossings during each of the last seven years.""  Jessica Vaughan, director of policy at the Center for Immigration Studies, which favors low immigration, said there are problems with comparing apprehension data over the last 50 years because of changes in the way U.S. Border Patrol deters illegal border crossings. Decades ago, the same people tried several times before they crossed, she said. She also said that the statistics on the number of apprehensions represents events, not people, and that the same person could be apprehended several times.  When we followed up with McMurray’s campaign for further evidence of his claim, his spokeswoman, Nicole Hushla, said that McMurray had heard the statistic on the MSNBC program ""Morning Joe."" Further questions we had about whether McMurray was talking about apprehensions of undocumented people at the border or about the undocumented population living in the United States were not answered.   Experts we spoke with gave mixed opinions about whether McMurray’s claim is accurate.  Warren, who formerly worked for the Census Bureau and has written many research papers that have been widely cited, said in an interview that he believes McMurray’s claim to be ""generally correct,"" based on the same apprehension data. ""Actually, if someone wanted to quibble with the statement, undocumented immigration probably was lower in the late 1960s and early 1970s than it was in the later part of the Obama administration; it was higher from the mid-1970s to the later part of the Obama administration – about 40 years,"" he said.  Some experts said McMurray’s claim is largely correct, based on apprehensions of people seeking to enter the country illegally, particularly of apprehensions at the southern border. Those figures, however, do not include visa overstays, a large source of illegal immigration.   ""If you define it to mean the size of the unauthorized immigrant population, that’s not accurate,"" said Michelle Mittelstadt, director of communications at the Migration Policy Institute, which supports liberal immigration policies. ""The size of the unauthorized population overall in the U.S. was at near-record highs during the start of the Obama administration and while it tapered off somewhat, the population remains vastly larger than it was 50 years ago.""  A researcher with the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports Trump’s immigration policies, noted the size of the population of unauthorized immigrants under Obama. Even when illegal immigration was lowest under Obama, that population was still approximately three times larger than it was in 1990, said Spencer Raley, the federation’s senior research associate. Raley also believes that the size of this population is underestimated because the government has trouble collecting accurate data.     McMurray tweeted that during the Obama administration illegal immigration dropped to a 50-year low.  Nothing in the data we reviewed shows that to be true. During Obama’s eight-year presidency, apprehensions of people who were in the country without authorization dropped to levels not seen since 1971. Apprehensions are not a precise measure of how many individuals enter the country and stay when they are not authorized to do so, and they do not include people who overstay their visas. But immigration researchers do use this data to make estimates about illegal immigration.   But even if McMurray had said apprehensions, his statement would have still been problematic. In November 2014, Obama said, ""Overall, the number of people trying to cross our border illegally is at its lowest level since the 1970s."" PolitiFact found his statement to be Half True. While PolitiFact found Obama to be correct on the sheer numbers of people caught trying to cross the border in 2013 and the 1970s, experts noted that Obama created an imperfect comparison because the border situation was far different in 1970 than in 2013. In the 1970s, it was easier for people to make multiple attempts or excursions illegally across the border. Demographers use the size of the population of illegal immigrants residing in the United States to measure trends in illegal immigration. This population was much lower decades ago, based on available data, than it was during the Obama administration, though some studies show that this population fell during the last 10 years.   We rate McMurray’s claim Mostly False.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097234940>],/factchecks/2019/sep/23/nathan-mcmurray/mcmurrays-illegal-immigration-claim-only-part-stor/

Can you have an outstanding arrest warrant for murder and pass a background check to buy a gun?
","Democrats in Texas are urging Gov. Greg Abbott to call a special legislative session to tackle gun violence in the wake of two mass shootings in the state that left 29 people dead. Lawmakers pushing for the session held a news conference outside of the Texas Capitol in early September, including state Rep.

""You can have an active warrant for your arrest for murder and legally pass a background check system in the state of Texas,"" Hinojosa said. Hinojosa’s staff said her claim is true, since the U.S. Department of Justice adopted a new interpretation for ""fugitive from justice,"" meaning the classification only refers to people wanted by law enforcement who have crossed state lines. A similar statement was repeated by Democratic state lawmakers during a hearing at the state Capitol on gun legislation at the end of September. The claim needs more context. In certain cases, someone with an active arrest warrant for murder could legally pass a background check and buy a gun in Texas, but it depends on where and how the warrant was issued. Before we dive into this fact-check, let’s explore the process for running a background check on a prospective gun-purchaser in Texas. Federal law requires licensed-gun dealers to run background checks on prospective buyers who do not have a license to carry. (A license is required to carry a handgun in public but is not required to purchase a gun.) Private sellers do not have to conduct background checks before making a sale. A person without a license to carry who is buying a gun in Texas from a licensed dealer must undergo a background check by first providing a photo ID and completing a form produced by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives to determine whether the individual falls into any category of person prohibited from purchasing a firearm. Federal and Texas laws state that a person cannot purchase or possess a firearm if the person has been convicted of a felony or certain misdemeanors related to domestic assault and the person's release from confinement or supervision occurred within the previous five years. Certain people with a history of mental illness also are barred from purchasing a gun, as is anyone who is considered a ""fugitive from justice"" — a category we’ll explore more in-depth later. Texas is not a ""point of contact"" state, which means the FBI runs background checks for prospective purchasers in the state. Once a request has been submitted by a dealer, the FBI has three business days to complete the check. After that period, the sale can go forward — even if the FBI has not completed its review. The FBI could later issue a ""delayed denial"" if the agency completes the check after the three-day window and discovers that a sale was completed for an individual who should have been barred from buying a gun. At that point, the case is referred to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives, which is responsible for recovering the firearm. Chelsea O’Hara, chief of staff to Hinojosa, said the Democrat’s statement is true under the new federal interpretation of fugitive from justice, a classification that forbids someone from purchasing a firearm. Before the shift, a person with an active arrest warrant for murder would have fit the definition, but the new interpretation changes things. O’Hara pointed to a news story about the change and provided a copy of a letter distributed by the FBI’s National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) division outlining the claim. She also shared a copy of the ATF form prospective purchasers are required to complete. The form includes the updated definition. The FBI and ATF had disagreed on who is considered a fugitive from justice since at least 2008, according to a 2016 audit from the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Justice. Under the FBI’s original definition, any individual with an outstanding arrest warrant would be unable to buy a gun. But the ATF considered a fugitive from justice only a person who has an outstanding arrest warrant and then leaves the state where the warrant was issued. In 2017, the Department of Justice sided with the ATF, prompting the FBI to purge the names of tens of thousands of people wanted by law enforcement agencies from its background check database, according to The Washington Post. A handful of states prevent anyone with an arrest warrant from purchasing a firearm, but Texas is not one of them. The FBI’s original definition for fugitive from justice would have included individuals with active warrants for their arrest for murder and other charges, thereby preventing them from buying a gun. But under the new definition, the existence of an arrest warrant on its own is no longer enough to deny the sale or transfer of a firearm to an individual, according to a statement provided by the National Instant Criminal Background Check System division at the FBI. In other words, the fugitive from justice statute would not necessarily stop a person with an active arrest warrant for murder issued in Texas from passing a background check to purchase a gun in the state. But such a person might be stopped by a different portion of the law. In addition to preventing fugitives from justice or people recently convicted of felonies or certain misdemeanors involving domestic violence from purchasing guns, the law also bars gun purchases for people with active arrest warrants that have ""been issued pursuant to an indictment for a crime punishable by imprisonment for a term exceeding one year,"" according to ATF spokeswoman Carolyn Gwathmey. This would include murder charges. Generally, an arrest warrant can be issued at the discretion of a judge or by way of a grand jury indictment, depending on the circumstances of a case. In murder cases, it is more common for a warrant to be issued by a judge than from a grand jury, to get a suspect off the street and into custody as soon as possible. Jennifer Szimanski, a public affairs officer at the Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas and a former detective at the Austin Police Department, said the investigating team might pursue an arrest warrant from a judge if they have ""very strong evidence of a crime being committed and the case appears ironclad."" She said investigators might pursue an indictment from a grand jury if ""the evidence is not as strong and mostly circumstantial"" but investigators are confident they’ve identified the right suspect. ""So your basic question, can someone wanted for murder roll into a gun store in Texas and buy a gun? The answer is yes — if that person’s warrant was issued just by a judge and doesn’t involve an indictment, and if there is no evidence readily available to the FBI or ATF that (the person) somehow sought to avoid that warrant,"" said David Chipman, a senior policy advisor at the Giffords Law Center and a former special agent at ATF. The idea behind the policy is that an individual would not lose their ability to access firearms until they have been convicted of a crime, according to John Donohue, a law professor at Stanford University. ""It’s certainly true that if there is more (in a person’s history) than just an arrest warrant, you may be curtailed,"" he said. ""But on its face, the statement says if you’re in Texas buying a gun with a warrant for arrest as a Texas resident, you’re probably fine. To me, that seems absolutely ludicrous. But it is the law."" Hinojosa said, ""You can have an active warrant for your arrest for murder and legally pass a background check system in the state of Texas."" Hinojosa’s claim needs more context. It’s true that certain people with active arrest warrants for murder could legally pass a background check in Texas and purchase a gun — but only if the warrant was issued prior to an indictment and if it originated in Texas. If an arrest warrant for murder was the result of an indictment or was issued in another state, the person could not pass a background check. We rate this claim Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE — The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097250940>],/factchecks/2019/sep/20/gina-hinojosa/can-you-have-outstanding-arrest-warrant-murder-and/

Are 1,600 new coal-fired power plants being constructed today?
","The president of the United Mine Workers of America  -- a union representing coal miners, many of them in West Virginia -- sees a future for coal in electricity generation despite concern that coal’s carbon emissions could bring about climate change.  In a Sept. 4 speech at the National Press Club in Washington, the union’s president, Cecil E. Roberts, touted the number of coal-fired power plants being constructed internationally. Roberts said: ""We need to develop technology to remove carbon from the burning of coal, or you’re never -- write that word down -- never going to resolve climate change. Never. Why is that? There are 1,600 -- 1,600 -- new coal-fired power plants being constructed as I speak around the world."" That’s a large number. Is it correct? We took a closer look. (The union did not respond to requests for comment.)   We found a New York Times article published on July 1, 2017, that said, ""Over all, 1,600 coal plants are planned or under construction in 62 countries."" At the very least, the 1,600 figure may be outdated, since it’s more than two years old. So we took a closer look at the sourcing. The article attributed this data to the Global Coal Plant Tracker, portal published by the Global Energy Monitor (GEM). This group, founded in 2007, has board members from such environmental groups as Clean Energy Action, Greenpeace, and the Rainforest Action Network. (The group did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) As it turns out, the number on the site today is lower.  The tracker classifies coal-fired units as being under one of the following categories: announced, cancelled, under construction, mothballed, operating, permitted, pre-permit stage, retired, and shelved. So we looked at the figures using a few combinations of these categories. There are 458 units currently under construction, according to the tracker -- well below the 1,600 Roberts cited.   A screen capture shows 458 coal-fired units with site preparation and other activities underway. (Global Coal Plant Tracker) If you add in those in the permitted or pre-permit stage, the number increases to 903. This number includes plants seeking environmental approvals and other developmental steps, according to the GEM website.  A screen capture shows 903 coal-fired units with permit, pre-permit and under construction. (Global Coal Plant Tracker) Even if you add in those that are ""announced"" -- which does not really qualify as being ""under construction"" -- it brings the number up to only 1,160. That’s more than one-quarter lower than the figure Roberts cited. (None of these are in the United States.) Kelly Sims Gallagher, director of the Climate Policy Lab at Tufts University, told PolitiFact that other sources of data indicate declining interest in coal-fired power plants. The International Energy Agency, a Paris-based international organization, found that final investment decisions for new coal power plants have declined steadily between 2015 and 2018.  Gallagher said this separate source of data ""reinforces"" questions about Roberts’ underlying argument -- that the coal power-plant sector is healthy. Finally, a technical point: The tracker uses the term ""units,"" while Roberts referred to ""plants."" A worldwide survey of coal-fired power plants shows that plants often include several units.  Roberts said, ""There are 1,600 new coal-fired power plants being constructed as I speak around the world."" A New York Times article from more than two years ago cited the 1,600 figure, but even then it described units being ""planned or under construction"" -- not strictly under construction.  In addition, those numbers appear to have shrunk in the succeeding two years. Using the same website as the Times used, there are 458 coal-fired units being built worldwide today, and 903 if you include those in the pre-permitting or permit phase -- significantly less than what Roberts indicated.  We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097BF1F80>],/factchecks/2019/sep/20/cecil-roberts/are-1600-new-coal-fired-power-plants-being-constru/

How many robocalls do Americans get each year? It’s hard to say
","If there is one issue that unites Republicans and Democrats, it’s robocalls. The automated calls that have flooded constituents’ phones are prompting congressional action. Over the summer, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 3375, the Stopping Bad Robocalls Act, by a vote of 429-3. The act amends the Communications Act of 1934 to clarify laws against making robocalls, and puts in place call-blocker technology to prevent future calls. In an Aug. 9 newsletter, U.S. Rep. Vicky Hartzler, R-Harrisonville, endorsed the act, claiming that ""robocalls prey on the most vulnerable among us, including senior citizens. ""Statistics indicate Americans have experienced 29.3 illegal robocalls so far this year, marking a 64 percent increase since 2016,"" Hartzler wrote. Hartzler’s statement included a typo, spokesperson Anna Swick said. She meant to say 29.3 billion illegal robocalls. That’s a big oopsy. Swick noted that a July 24 news release included the word billion. But there’s another wrinkle: How many are really considered illegal? Any phone call that includes a recorded message rather than a live person is considered a robocall, according to the Federal Trade Commission. If the receiver of the call did not give consent to receive it, the call is considered illegal. So that robocall reminding you of a doctor’s appointment is probably OK; the one promising you riches from a foreign prince probably isn’t. We decided to take a closer look into the robocall issue and find out whether Hartzler’s statement — the one with 29.3 ""billion"" that was intended to run — holds up. In her newsletter, Hartzler used numbers from a robocall blocking app called YouMail that were cited in the report for H.R. 3375. But there’s a big difference between Hartzler’s numbers and YouMail’s, and that is the use of the word ""illegal."" YouMail CEO Alex Quilici said the app tracks the calls made by its 10 million users and uses their area codes to extrapolate the data for the entire country and specific states. The app then funnels that data into a robocall index. The app does not, however, distinguish between illegal and legal robocalls. YouMail’s data actually reports 29.3 billion total robocalls from January until the end of July. YouMail gives four categories of calls: alerts, payment reminders, scams, and telemarketing. So, you could guess that the scams are illegal. But Hartzler’s claim didn’t break it down. Other databases suggest that robocalls are a problem, but the numbers vary by government agency. The Federal Communications Commission received 232,000 robocall complaints in 2018, according to the House Report. The Federal Trade Commission reported 4.1 million robocall complaints in 2018. Comparing YouMail data and federal data isn’t exactly apples to apples. YouMail tracks all robocalls received by its app users, while the FCC and FTC only collect complaints. These reports can give some sense of the problem, but they leave out those people who don’t file complaints or use call-blocker apps. Hartzler stated that robocalls target senior citizens, and that Americans have experienced 29.3 illegal robocalls this year. When asked, her office amended the statement to 29.3 billion. She said these were illegal calls. Some might be, but not all of them. Because of this key difference, we rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0A10C0>],/factchecks/2019/sep/20/vicky-hartzler/how-many-robocalls-do-americans-get-each-year-its-/

Trump policies Duckworth cited haven’t hurt housing access — yet
","Responding to news President Donald Trump is considering cracking down on homelessness in California, U.S. Sen. Tammy Duckworth blasted his administration for a series of policies she said have exacerbated the problem. Trump, who has called the state’s burgeoning homelessness crisis ""a disgrace,"" sent officials to Los Angeles last week to find ways to limit the growing number of people living on the streets there. On Monday, Duckworth re-tweeted a link to a New York Times article about the administration’s efforts, adding her take: ""Just a quick reminder that Trump & @HUDgov have actually *worsened* our nation's homelessness crisis,"" Duckworth wrote, followed by a list of policy actions she claimed had been taken by the administration, including cuts to affordable housing programs, allowing shelters to refuse people based on gender identity or sexual orientation, evicting immigrant families of mixed legal status from subsidized housing and raising rents on low-income individuals. Just a quick reminder that Trump & @HUDgov have actually *worsened* our nation's homelessness crisis by:-Cutting programs for affordable housing-Allowing shelters to refuse LGBTQ+ ppl-Evicting mixed-status immigrants from subsidized housing-Tripling/raising rent https://t.co/OqTIctlhgO Trump has indeed proposed changes that match what Duckworth described. Each has been widely criticized for the risk they pose to housing access for some of the nation’s most vulnerable residents. But none of his proposed policy changes have yet been enacted, and Congress is moving forward with a budget that does not include the steep cuts to housing the president wanted. Trump — who argued people living on the streets have ruined the ""prestige"" of Los Angeles and San Francisco — has rejected appeals from local officials for more funding to address the issue. He has also said the EPA will issue an environmental notice against San Francisco to address the problem. After we contacted Duckworth’s office for an explanation, she responded to her original tweet with another within hours. In it, she wrote that she ""should have said they had *tried* to do these four things"" but that Trump and his administration ""have not yet succeeded, despite repeated efforts."" My earlier tweet is inaccurate. I should have said they had *tried* to do these four things, which is true. The language in the earlier tweet should have said “have sought to worsen our nation's homelessness crisis.” They have not yet succeeded, despite repeated efforts. Still, we wanted to set the record straight for those who haven’t seen Duckworth’s correction and provide some background on the proposals she cited. Here’s our recap: Trump’s 2020 budget proposed deep cuts for the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development that called for slashing funds for programs that help low-income people access housing. The proposal was widely described as a nonstarter in Congress, where it met bipartisan disapproval among lawmakers. This summer, Congress passed a budget to allow for higher levels of government spending with Trump’s support. Lawmakers have not yet finalized the appropriations bills, but advocates we spoke with no longer anticipate housing cuts. The president's budget was rejected in similar fashion last year. After lawmakers made clear they did not intend to approve Trump’s proposed cuts, HUD Secretary Ben Carson backed off a plan announced that April to increase rent on millions of federal housing assistance recipients. The proposed legislation called for tripling the rent paid by some of the nation’s poorest households, with minimum rates rising from $50 to $150. Even though it was presented when Republicans held majorities in both the House and Senate, lawmakers have shown little interest in advancing it. Earlier this year, Trump also proposed federal rule changes to limit housing for the poor. While they do not require congressional approval, the administration cannot greenlight them without undergoing a lengthy review process, which has not yet been completed. In May, the administration proposed rolling back Obama-era protections that prevent federally funded homeless shelters from discriminating against individuals based on their sexual orientation or gender identity. If Trump’s plan is approved, it could allow single-sex shelters to deny services to transgender people. Also this spring, the White House introduced a plan to remove undocumented immigrants and their families from public housing, which a HUD analysis determined could displace more than 55,000 children who are legal U.S. residents or citizens. Current rules prevent undocumented immigrants from receiving federal housing subsidies unless their child or spouse is eligible. Landlords and local housing officials have voiced concern over the proposal, which may face legal challenges. Housing advocates oppose both proposals, along with another Trump plan they argue would make it more difficult to allege housing discrimination in lawsuits under the civil rights-era Fair Housing Act. Following news Trump is considering cracking down on homelessness in California, Duckworth claimed the president and his housing department have ""worsened our nation’s homelessness crisis"" by cutting affordable housing programs, allowing shelters to refuse people based on gender identity, evicting immigrant families of mixed legal status from subsidized housing and raising rents on people who receive federal housing assistance. The president’s administration has issued a series of proposals to that effect. But Trump has not yet succeeded in making any of the changes Duckworth described, a point she publicly acknowledged following our inquiry. We rate her claim Mostly False.

Florida Sen. Rick Scott misleads about “record funding” for HIV prevention
","An investigative report by The Guardian found that when Sen. Rick Scott was Florida’s governor, he left millions of federal dollars unspent to fight HIV. That has prompted Scott to renew a familiar and misleading talking point about HIV/AIDS funding during his administration as governor. Scott’s Senate office told The Guardian, a left-leaning British newspaper, that as governor Scott ""invested record funding in HIV/Aids prevention."" In 2016 we rated a similar statement by Scott about ""record funding"" Mostly False. Scott was referring to money that almost entirely came from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention while only a small slice came from the state budget.  Scott’s spokespersons did not respond to our questions this time around. They have vaguely pushed back against The Guardian report by repeating the refrain about record funding. When a reporter for Bay News 9 asked Scott if there was any particular reason the state didn’t use the money he said ""no."" There are two key federal pots of money designed for HIV: money from the CDC for prevention and money from the Health Resources and Services Administration, known as the Ryan White funds, for treatment.  When Scott talks about a record for prevention he is referring to the CDC federal money, which can be used for prevention programs such as testing and condom distribution. The amount awarded by the CDC during Scott’s tenure rose from about $19.4 million in 2011 to $34.8 million in 2016. (We asked the CDC and the Florida Department of Health for additional dollar amounts for 2017 and 2018 but didn’t hear back.) We found that Florida did add in some of its own money. The state provided an additional $1.4 million in 2015 for a public awareness campaign, an HIV hotline and four targeted outreach coordinators. When Scott signed the 2016-17 budget, he noted the state contribution for HIV/AIDS services was upped to $1.65 million — .002% out of a total state budget of $82 billion. As for the rising CDC federal funding, that wasn’t because of increased efforts by the state. The funding formula takes into account population, so Florida received more CDC funding than any other state except New York and California in 2015. The money also takes into account infection rates and patient population. The Obama administration aimed to strengthen prevention efforts in communities where HIV was the most heavily concentrated. In other words, Florida received an increase in federal funding because the state needed it.  Scott rejected a separate source of federal funding that could have helped patients with HIV: expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Increased Medicaid coverage in expansion states drove a nationwide increase in coverage for people with HIV, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation found. Medicaid represents the single-largest source of coverage for people with HIV. The Guardian’s article largely focused on what happened with money Florida received from the Ryan White funds, which provide money for treatment. Between 2015 and 2017, Florida returned $54 million in unspent money after the state health department failed to secure permission from the Legislature to spend it, the Guardian reported. Scott had a philosophy of refusing federal money in many circumstances. A Health Resources and Services Administration spokeswoman confirmed for PolitiFact Florida that the state returned the $54 million. It’s common for states to return money to comply with federal rules. States must spend certain drug rebate funds before they spend the Ryan White grant dollars.  In 2016, there were 29 states that returned money — anywhere from hundreds to millions of dollars. In 2014 and 2015, Florida returned the highest amounts of any state — $53 million. The next year, Florida returned an additional $767,000. The Guardian reported that as the state missed out on millions of dollars, the number of new HIV cases increased.  Jen Kates, an expert on HIV policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, told PolitiFact that investments in the right programs can drive down infection rates. ""Broadly speaking, there is definitely a link between investments and the epidemic,"" Kates said. ""I can’t say in this case if what happened with these funds had an impact either way."" When Scott was governor, Florida ""invested record funding in HIV/Aids prevention."" Spending on HIV/AIDS prevention dramatically rose during Scott’s tenure as governor, but that was mostly a result of rising federal CDC dollars. The state kicked in a much smaller amount. Those federal dollars rose because Florida, a large state with a rising number of cases, needed the money. Scott’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.   ",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B4AA80>],/factchecks/2019/sep/20/rick-scott/florida-sen-rick-scott-misleads-about-record-fundi/

Is private-sector experience in short supply in the Obama administration?
","
Ah, the stealthy side of politics.

Stolen campaign yard signs. Anonymous fliers mailed to voters disparaging an opponent. And then there’s the chain email.

A PolitiFact Georgia reader forwarded us an email sent her way about President Barack Obama and asked us to examine its veracity. The email was full of charts and graphs that would suggest Obama has done a poor job as president. Some have been widely discussed and examined by PolitiFact and other fact-checking operations, such as how many Americans are receiving food stamps and a comparison of unemployment rates under Obama and his two most recent predecessors.

There was one comparison that has come up before that we felt compelled to address since it hasn’t been written about on our site. Under a chart titled ""Cabinet Appointments: Prior Private Sector Experience, 1900-2009,"" it had Obama below the 10 percent mark.

Could it be? Did less than 10 percent of Obama’s Cabinet appointments have private-sector experience before working for the president?

The email ends with a request to forward it to at least two other people.

""100 would be even better,"" it said.

Those who receive the email may want to hold off before doing so to make sure they’re distributing accurate information.

One consistent theme of criticism leveled against Obama is that he does not comprehend what the American economy needs in order to grow because the president doesn’t understand how the private sector works. Obama campaign officials respond that his economic policies helped keep the nation from falling into a depression and have resulted in a modest recovery.

So what about his Cabinet? Obama critics appear to be fond of claiming the president’s Cabinet had little private-sector experience, using a chart that accompanied a column written in Forbes about Obama’s ""business blind spot"" in 2009.

Obama had by far the lowest percentage on the chart. John F. Kennedy was the next lowest, with just below 30 percent of his Cabinet appointments having private-sector experience. Most of the others were between 40 percent and 50 percent.

The writer, Michael Cembalest, examined the histories of nine Cabinet positions for the comparison. The departments they headed were Agriculture, Commerce, Energy, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Labor, State, Transportation and Treasury:

Conservative commentator Glenn Beck talked about the chart on his show shortly afterward, saying less than 10 percent of Obama's Cabinet appointees ""have any experience in the private sector."" PolitiFact examined Beck’s statement, came across the Forbes article and did its own research. It found three Obama Cabinet members in those nine departments that Cembalest cited had significant corporate or business experience: Steven Chu in Energy, Shaun Donovan in HUD and Ken Salazar in Interior.

Chu headed the electronics research lab at AT&T Bell Laboratories; Donovan served as managing director of Prudential Mortgage Capital Co.; and Salazar has been a partner in his family's farm, and he owned and operated a Dairy Queen and radio stations in his home state of Colorado.

Three other Obama appointees had legal experience in the private sector: Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack and Commerce Secretary Gary Locke. Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner worked for Kissinger Associates, a consulting firm that advises international corporations on political and economic conditions overseas.

Cembalest said that he did discount the corporate experience of Clinton, Vilsack and Locke. Cembalest acknowledged fault in missing Salazar's business background, saying he would have given him a full point if he had it to do over again. Cembalest said Chu and Donovan did not represent the kind of private-sector business experience he was looking for when doing his study. Cembalest said he did not mean for his research to be used for political ends.

Beck got a False on the Truth-O-Meter for repeating the claim, holding the commentator accountable for his words. Nearly two years later, in August 2011, U.S. Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn., made a similar claim about Obama’s Cabinet during the early stages of her presidential bid.

""[Obama] has virtually no one in his Cabinet with private-sector experience,"" she said.

Not true. Her claim got a Pants on Fire.

Once again, the chart contains data that the author has since said was missing some information. It seems clear that more than 10 percent of Obama’s Cabinet has private-sector experience. The authors of this chain email should know better by now. We say hit the delete button on this claim.

"['Voting Record', 'Wisconsin', 'Dan Sebring']","
Sebring says Moore is ‘most absent member’ of Wisconsin’s congressional delegation
","
Republican candidate for Congress Dan Sebring chose a simple way to measure the performance of U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore in a hard-hitting radio ad: The roll call of votes.

The ad includes an audio clip of Moore, a four-term member of Congress, screaming ""Scott Walker, you gotta go, baby, ‘cause we don’t want you no more!"" Sebring, who is challenging Moore for a second time, then reminds listeners in north shore Milwaukee suburbs that, due to redistricting, Moore is now their representative.

Then he turns to the ad’s main point:

""Gwen Moore is Wisconsin’s most absent member of Congress, missing nearly 17 percent of the House votes in the second quarter of 2012.""

Is Sebring right?

His campaign did not respond to requests for backup, but Sebring, who runs an auto repair shop, elaborates on his website.

The site says the attendance claim is based on data compiled by GovTrack.us, an independent site founded in 2004 that that follows legislation, tracks the voting record of individual lawmakers and -- among other things -- monitors missed votes by each member of Congress.

GovTrack breaks down the missed votes into quarters while the congressional calendar runs on a two-year session, with lengthy breaks for holidays, the month of August, and -- typically -- re-election season.

In the second quarter of 2012, GovTrack says there were 299 votes -- the most in any quarter in the current session. Moore missed 50 votes, or 16.7 percent, the site says.

In the first quarter, Moore missed 23 of 151 votes, or 15.2 percent. In the third quarter it was 5 of 152, or 3.3 percent, which is more consistent with the first year of the term.

In the second quarter, the one cited by Sebring, the missed votes easily put Moore at the top of the state’s eight-member House delegation.

In the quarter, Republicans Paul Ryan, F. James Sensenbrenner, and Reid Ribble missed zero votes; Democrat Tammy Baldwin missed 21, or 7 percent; Democrat Ron Kind missed 12, or 4 percent, and Republicans Sean Duffy and Tom Petri missed one, 0.3 percent.

But the numbers don’t tell the whole story.

We asked Moore’s campaign to respond to the missed votes claim. Her campaign’s political director, Moore’s sister, Brenda, referred us to congressional chief of staff Minh Ta.

Ta said Moore was dealing with a family crisis during the first part of this year. Her older sister, Yvonne, suffered a brain aneurysm and underwent surgery in St. Louis in early March 2012. Later that month, during rehabilitation, Moore’s sister suffered a stroke. In April, she  was moved to Milwaukee, where she is in an assisted living facility.

Moore was with her sister off and on throughout the surgery, rehabilitation and move, Ta said.

Ta said he could not be more precise about the number of days Moore was away from Washington, but said it was a significant family crisis that extended over two months -- and over the first two quarters of the year.

""She strives to make every vote as much as she can,"" Ta said. ""Like every normal person, she’s got family crises and so forth.""

But what about the other part of Sebring’s claim, that Moore is the ""most absent"" member of the state delegation?

You can use the GovTrack data to get a picture for the fulls session, which began seven quarters ago in January 2011. That’s a good point of reference, since it puts first-termers Ribble and Duffy on the same footing as the rest.

Looking at the full session, Moore missed 112 votes, or 6.98 percent.  If you take out the first two quarters of 2012,  Moore missed an average of 3.4 percent of the votes in the other five quarters of this session.

So, it’s clear Sebring did some cherry-picking by citing only the second quarter.

But that approach still puts Moore at the top of the chart for this session of Congress. The next highest was Ryan, who is running for vice president. Ryan missed 42 votes (or 27.6 percent) in the third quarter. But even when that is factored in, he winds up at 3.09 percent missed for the term.

Baldwin, who has been campaigning for a U.S. Senate seat, comes in at 3.03 percent missed votes for the session.

Overall, the state delegation missed an average of 2.53 percent of the votes this session. That compares with the median of 2.5 percent for all of Congress, according to GovTrack.

In her total time in Congress, starting with January of 2005, Moore has missed 5 percent of votes, also at the top of the charts. Ryan, Baldwin, Kind, Sensenbrenner, Duffy and Ribble all missed 2 percent, while Petri missed 1 percent. That, again, compares to the median of 2.5 percent, according to GovTrack.

Our rating

Sebring says Moore is the state’s ""most absent"" member of Congress and that she missed 17 percent of the House votes in the second quarter of 2012.

Indeed, Moore missed nearly 17 percent of the votes in the second quarter. That is Moore’s worst quarter, but it also amounts to Sebring doing some cherry-picking of data. A longer period shows a lower percentage, but even that places Moore at the top of the state’s eight-member delegation.

Eric Cantor says he never backed sequestration
","
During a recent debate for the 7th District House seat, Democrat challenger Wayne Powell accused Republican Rep. Eric Cantor of flip-flopping on $1 trillion in automatic federal spending cuts that are slated to begin on Jan. 2.

Powell noted Cantor voted for a bill in August 2011 that set up the possibility of the cuts, which would be split evenly between defense and social program over nine years. The reductions -- called sequestration -- would kick in if Congress and the White House failed to agree on a debt-reduction deal.

Powell noted Cantor has been distancing himself from the sequester now that it is nearing and denouncing the automatic military cuts as harmful to the nation’s security.

""For you to stand here and say you did not vote for the sequester when you voted for the sequester. This is not magical thinking. This is reality,"" Powell told Cantor during the debate. ""You supported it, and now you don’t.""

The House majority leader replied, ""Mr. Powell keeps saying that I support the sequester. As he knows good and well, that’s not true.""

Has Cantor changed his position on the sequester? We decided to submit the question to our Flip-O-Meter.

We’ll start with a trip back to the summer of 2011. Debate over raising the U.S. debt ceiling dominated headlines with the approach of an August 2 deadline when the U.S. would start defaulting on payments if it could not borrow more money. Republicans, led in part by Cantor, insisted on tying an increase in the borrowing cap to passage of a debt reduction plan. Negotiations between Congress and the White House stalemated, with Republicans demanding that all of the debt reductions come from spending cuts and Democrats insisting that a portion come from tax increases.

Cantor supported a last-second compromise passed the House by a 269-161 vote on August 1 and, a day later, cleared the Senate on a 74-26 vote. It took a two-step approach to lowering debt.

The first part called for an initial $900 billion in deficit reductions over 10 years through a mix of national security and domestic spending cuts.

The second part created a bipartisan congressional super committee assigned to come up with an additional $1.5 trillion in deficit reductions over nine years through spending cuts, tax revenues or both. If the panel deadlocked, $1 trillion in automatic cuts would be triggered at the start of 2013.

Cantor, in a statement released after House vote, gave a qualified endorsement of the debt-limit deal with no specific mention of the sequester.

""Tonight, the House prevented default and boosted economic certainty by ensuring America pays its bills while we start getting our fiscal house in order,"" he said. ""This measure is not perfect or the way we would have done it if we were in charge, but it will finally begin to change the way Washington spends tax dollars.... This is the first significant move -- of many to come -- to turn Washington around.""

But the partisan debate over whether increased taxes should be part of the debt-reduction plan did not end, and super committee deadlocked. Cantor, during a Nov. 14 news conference, was repeatedly asked if he was bound to allowing the automatic cuts to occur.

""I’m not going to comment,"" he said. ""I don’t think the sequester will be applicable because I believe they will reach an agreement by the deadline.""

On Nov. 21, the super committee announced it failed meet its deadline for reaching an agreement, triggering the sequester.

This year, on May 10, Cantor and other House Republicans passed a debt reduction plan that held the line on taxes. It offered deep reductions to domestic programs that would replace across-the-board in sequester for a year. The measure died in the Democrat-controlled Senate.

During a June 6 news conference, Cantor said ""we’re not going to allow tax rates to go up on anyone."" He said he and other Republicans were willing to broaden the tax base by eliminating some income tax deductions, although he did not specify which ones.

On July 18, Cantor denounced the sequestration. ""These cuts will harm important  domestic priorities such as education, medical research and law enforcement,"" he said in a written statement. ""And perhaps most notably, these cuts threaten our national security and jobs...including (those of) over 100,000 Virginians who make their living in our military, or by ensuring that our men and women in uniform have the very best equipment and support available.""

On Sept. 11, Cantor told the Fredericksburg Chamber of Commerce that he supported the 2011 debt deal to ""stave off any other kind of calamity."" Of the sequester, he said, ""It was never intended to be something that went into effect,"" according to an article in The Free Lance-Star.

On Sept. 20, Cantor told Fox News: ""This president has failed to put a solution on the table that would avoid these defense cuts. The House has taken action to say we don’t want these defense cuts, we want to act in a fiscally responsible way and make sure we are beginning to slim down federal spending, but don’t do so in a way that disproportionately impacts our defense-related jobs.""  

Our rating

Congress was faced with a stark choice in August 2011: Either agree to a deal that could trigger the sequester or place the nation in default. Cantor chose the deal. As we have written before, it is possible to have voted for the compromise out of a desire to keep Washington solvent and hope that the automatic cuts never occur.

We couldn’t find any record Cantor saying he supported having the sequester. But the majority leader helped set the clock ticking on the cuts by voting for a measure that included their possibility. And he’s maintained a hard line against the compromise Democrats say is necessary to avoid the sequester: mixing in some tax increases with spending cuts to reduce deficits.

Cantor is now distancing himself from a situation he helped create. We rate that a Full Flop.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973CD980>],/factchecks/2012/oct/08/eric-cantor/eric-cantor-says-he-never-backed-sequestration/
"['Tennessee', 'Campaign Finance', 'Jim Kyle']","
All legislative mail approved by Senate speaker, says state's Democratic leader
","
When Sen. Tim Barnes recently came under attack from Republicans for spending $15,517 in taxpayer money on printed direct mail fliers to constituents during an election year, Senate Minority Leader Jim Kyle rose to his fellow Democrat's defense.

The criticism of Barnes, D-Clarksville, came from Jordan Young, Senate Republican Caucus executive director, and was reported by the Clarksville Leaf-Chronicle. Young acknowledged that Barnes complied with legislative rules in his mailings, but said ""that doesn't make it right.""

Barnes, opposed by Republican Mark Green in the Nov. 6 election, is effectively using taxpayer money to build up his name recognition and that is not fair, said Young, when ""our candidate has to pay for it himself.""

Barnes told the newspaper that his use of the legislature's ""postage and printing"" account is ""perfectly ethical . . . common practice and a vital and needed way to communicate with constituents."" Kyle, the Senate's top Democrat, went further in deeming the Republican attack ""unfounded criticism.""

""All legislative mail – from the content to the timing – is approved by the speaker’s office, therefore if they have an argument, they have to take it up with Speaker (Ron) Ramsey, who the last time I looked was a Republican,"" Kyle said in the Leaf-Chronicle article.

""And I guarantee he reads every one of those word for word.

Envisioning Lt. Gov. Ramsey, the Senate speaker, sitting down with a pile of legislator mail to read and edit was rather difficult for us. So we have taken a look at how things work with the sometimes controversial taxpayer funding of ""constituent communications"" through the ""postage and printing accounts.""

Connie Ridley, director of the Office of Legislative Administration, oversees the process in accordance with policies adopted by the Joint Legislative Services Committee. Under the system, each state senator is annually allocated $6,832 -- each representative $2,016 – for his or her account. There's a specific list of what the money can be used to purchase – Tennessee or American flags for presentation to constituents and ""fax machine toner cartridges"" are OK, for example, but not a website.

As for mail to constituents, Ridley says there are basically two categories. First, there is what might be called regular mail – the daily flow of letters, postcards and the like to and from legislators, their constituents, other government officials and various parties interested in legislation.

Basically, a legislator need only put his or her outgoing mail in a box outside a Legislative Plaza office and it is sent out with the postage paid by the state and charged to the legislator's account. The envelopes and typing paper can also be billed to the account.

""We do not read a legislator's mail,"" says Ridley.

Ergo, Kyle is off base in describing ""all legislative mail"" as subject to approval of the speaker's office. A second class of mail, however, may be subject to approval by the Senate speaker in the case of senators, or the House speaker in the case of representatives. This is ""bulk mail,"" defined by policy as 200 or more pieces of the same printed material, according to Ridley.

Even with ""bulk mail,"" approval is not required if the legislator or his staff takes care of reproducing the letter and stuffing the envelopes, Ridley said.

But if the mailing is printed – either by the State Printing Office or a private printer – then approval is mandatory for payment of the printing and postage costs. In effect, this gets the slick, hard-paper mailers with photographs and different colors that are also typically used in political campaign direct mail advertising.

For state-paid mailings, however, the rules prohibit any political messaging and this is where the approval of content comes in. Officially, the rules require the speakers' approval of bulk mail that includes a printing expense.

Actually, however, the speakers have delegated the approval process to key staffers, according to Adam Kleinheider, spokesman for Ramsey, and Kara Owen, spokeswoman for Harwell. In Ramsey's case, he has delegated to Russell Humphrey, chief clerk of the Senate; while Harwell has delegated review responsibility jointly to Scott Gilmer, House chief of staff, and Owen.

As a practical matter, much of the reviewing is done by Ridley, who works with the speakers' designated point persons to check content for anything that could be seen as a political pitch – using the word ""vote,"" for example. Ridley recalls a recent case in which a legislator wrote that he would ""welcome the support"" of constituents. Thinking that could be interpreted as a solicitation for campaign contributions, Ridley had that edited out.

The mailings are supposed to be means of communicating information. Typically, they will list legislation passed by the General Assembly and the individual legislator's role in passage – or defeat, as the case may be. And some lawmakers send out questionnaires to constituents asking their views on issues. 
The Barnes' mailers criticized by Republicans are typical. One, mailed in June, carried the headline, ""Working for You"" and listed legislative actions the senator supported. The other, mailed in September, carried the headline, ""Fighting For Us. Delivering For Our Community"" and also reported on legislative doings.

There's a timing aspect that comes into play for printed bulk mailings. The rules prohibit such mailings for 30 days prior to an election – either a primary or general election. This, of course, doesn't involve much approval – either the mailing is sent before the pre-election blackout period or is not.

Even during the blackout, legislators can continue with regular mailings. If they do their own reproduction in their office and stuff the envelopes with a letter requiring no special printing, that's fine, said Ridley.

The state mail service is on notice to report to the Office of Legislative Administration any ""bulk"" mailing of over 200 pieces, Ridley said. If she receives such a notice, Ridley said it would trigger an inquiry to the legislator and perhaps a reminder about the rules – but no penalties.

Should any legislator use the mail for political purposes, he or she could face after-the-fact fallout, perhaps starting with complaints from the legislator's political opponent.

After being educated on the procedures for constituent communication at taxpayer expense, we asked Kyle about his comments. The senator said he was not aware of some of the details, even though he is a member of the Joint Legislative Services Committee, and acknowledged making a mistake in suggesting the speaker individually reviews ""all legislative mail.""

""I retract that,"" he said.

Kyle noted that he has printing of his mailers done in Memphis and mailed in Memphis, then bills the state through his account. That printing triggers the requirement of approval.

Kyle certainly has had no problem in getting approval, having sent 17 separate bills to Ridley's office this year, spending a total of $40,001 from his account. That used up the surplus accumulated in his account from previous years – the rules allow lawmakers to carry over unspent funds year after year – and then some. His account is actually $6,022 in the red, awaiting infusion of his next year's $6,832 allowance to cover the shortfall.

Our ruling

The Democratic leader pointed out that, with Republicans in control of the Legislature, they in general benefit more from the constituent communications accounts than do members of the minority party. And he correctly noted in comments to the Leaf-Chronicle that Barnes followed all the rules.

But by going on to declare that all legislative mail requires approval of the speaker, Kyle erred. We rule this statement as False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DB6500>],/factchecks/2012/oct/08/jim-kyle/all-legislative-mail-approved-by-Senate-speaker/

Michael Riley blames Rep. James Langevin for helping gasoline prices double.
","
It's an informal tradition in politics that if you're running for national office, you blame the incumbent for everything except the weather. (Although in these days of debate over climate change, the weather might be an issue of contention as well.)

Republican Michael Riley followed that tradition in a Sept. 30, 2012, news release attacking incumbent U.S. Rep. James Langevin, a Democrat.

Headlined ""Langevin Does Nothing to Lower the Price of Gas in Rhode Island,"" it blames Langevin for taking votes that led to higher gasoline prices, such as opposing ""completion of the Keystone Pipeline."" (For the record, the pipeline, even if it had been approved as proposed in 2008, wasn't going to be completed until 2013, so it would have had no effect on current gasoline prices.)

""When Congressman Langevin took office, gas was around $1.70 per gallon, and now it is near $4 per gallon,"" the Riley release says, contending elsewhere in the statement that Langevin is ""in part"" to blame.

First, we checked Riley's numbers.

According to the Rhode Island Office of Energy Resources, when Langevin took office  on Jan. 8, 2001, the average price of a gallon of self-service gasoline was about $1.54. The Bureau of Labor Statistics pegs the January 2001 price at $1.53. That's not $1.70. Riley got that wrong.

On Sept. 30, 2012, when Riley issued his news release, the Rhode Island price was about $3.93, nearly $4, as the candidate said. He got that part right.

When looking at claims such as this, we also ask ourselves whether it's accurate to ascribe blame.

Riley says in his news release that Langevin is partly to blame because of his energy votes.

We called and e-mailed the Riley campaign on Oct. 2 to find out how much blame he was talking about. We asked: ""How much responsibility does Langevin bear for the gas prices going from $1.70 when he took office to close to $4 now? 100%? 50%? 10%? 1%? 0.1%?""

We never got a response.

In fact, oil is a world commodity and gasoline prices are influenced by a wide variety of factors beyond the control of a single politician, and Langevin is one of 535 voting members of Congress.

The impact of the pipeline, to cite one of Riley's issues, is debatable. While the company behind the project has said it would reduce prices by 3.5 to 4 cents per gallon, a March Business Week story concluded that building the pipeline wouldn't bring down gasoline prices. Another analysis predicted that the pipeline could actually raise prices by 10 cents per gallon.

Analysts whom PolitiFact and other news organizations have consulted over the years have repeatedly said that office holders, including the president, have little impact on gasoline prices at any particular time.

Our ruling

Michael Riley blames Rep. James Langevin ""in part"" for skyrocketing gasoline prices, saying, ""When Congressman Langevin took office, gas was around $1.70 per gallon, and now it is near $4 per gallon.""

Langevin was first elected to Congress nearly a dozen years ago, when the price was closer to $1.53, not $1.70.

But Langevin's role in the global oil and gasoline market is so small to be almost inconsequential.

Because Riley's statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, we rate it Mostly False.

"['Health Care', 'Taxes', 'Wisconsin', 'Tammy Baldwin']","
Baldwin says Thompson wants to raise taxes on small businesses
","
When the first debate in the U.S. Senate race turned to government spurring job growth, Democrat Tammy Baldwin said spending on education, research and infrastructure could boost private-sector employment.

Then she trained her criticism on her opponent, Republican Tommy Thompson:

""Unfortunately my opponent is supporting a budget plan that -- because he's giving such huge tax breaks to the very wealthy and raising taxes on the middle class and small businesses -- they are slashing those very investments that I think are essential to growth.""

Thompson turned to Baldwin and responded: ""When you don’t have a record you attack the other person. I’m not in Congress -- you are.""

Thompson then ticked off a list of positive Wisconsin jobs numbers and tax cuts approved during his governorship from 1986 to 2001.

The two words -- ""small business"" -- jumped out for one reader, who asked us to check it out.

We’ve dealt before with the other part of Baldwin’s claim, that Thompson wants to raise taxes on the middle class.

We rated Half True a claim in a Baldwin TV ad that Thompson ""wants to give a new $265,000 tax cut to millionaires like himself while raising taxes on the middle class.""

The budget plan offered by U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., which Thompson has endorsed -- and some of Thompson’s own proposals -- would mean big cuts for upper-income earners.

But we said the middle-class part drew a questionable conclusion based on worst-case-scenario assumptions about what tax deductions Thompson and Ryan would eliminate.

Now, what about raising taxes on small business?

When asked for backup, the Baldwin campaign pointed us back to the debate and Thompson’s statement that ""we gotta do away with,"" the 2010 Affordable Care Act, which Republicans term ""Obamacare.""

If you eliminate the law, her campaign said, you also eliminate the law’s income tax credit for hundreds of thousands of small businesses. In other words, Thompson would in effect raise taxes on small businesses.

The reference to the federal health reform law was not part of the original Baldwin claim. She spoke broadly about the effect of Thompson’s plans on small business, so we have to take a broader view as well.

First, it strikes us as legitimate for Baldwin to hold Thompson to his word on ""Obamacare,"" and on the Ryan budget he has explicitly endorsed. And the health care law does contain a Small Business Health Care Tax Credit designed to cut premium costs and encourage businesses to offer insurance coverage to employees.

It’s no small change, either.

As of mid-2011, 228,000 taxpayers had claimed more than $278 million in credits, according to federal figures. Those numbers were well below expectations, due in part to some businesses saying credits were not worth the paperwork. But businesses taking the credits can get a break of up to 35 percent on premium payments, and up to 50 percent after 2013.

Small businesses and tax-exempt employers can claim the credit for up to six years, as long as they pay at least one-half the cost of health insurance coverage for their employees. One limitation is that it applies only to businesses that pay lower-end wages.

So is the loss of a tax credit the same as a tax increase?

Experts take both sides, as PolitiFact Wisconsin and PolitiFact New Jersey have noted.

In 2011, we gave Gov. Scott Walker a Promise Broken on his pledge to oppose all tax increases because he cut income tax credits related to property and income status. In that case the issue was settled by the official nonpartisan budget scorekeeper, the Wisconsin Legislative Fiscal Bureau, which called the changes a tax increase.

Thompson, meanwhile, has pounded Baldwin as a tax-raiser because she wouldn’t make permanent for everyone the Bush tax cuts of 2001-’03 that are set to expire -- cuts that included a bevy of sweetened tax credits.

At first cut, then, Baldwin’s camp makes a point.

But there’s a lot more to this one.

First, the federal health reform law includes multiple tax increases for individuals and businesses. Chris Edwards, director of tax policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said it’s unfair to pick out just one side of the ledger and ignore the other.

Edwards noted the legislation contained a new tax on medical devices companies, some of which are small businesses.

Indeed, the tax hikes in the law are one of Thompson’s rationales for opposing the law.

What’s more, Thompson has proposed replacing portions of the law with various reforms. One, it turns out, is a tax credit designed -- as in the original law -- to reduce premium costs for small businesses.

In Thompson’s case, he would give the credit directly to employees of small businesses instead of the employers, but the goal is the same: To reduce costs.

As we noted, there’s a bigger picture here as well -- the impact of Ryan’s federal budget plan and Thompson’s own RESTORE America tax plan on small businesses.

Thompson’s plan, mirroring Ryan’s, calls for cutting the top corporate income tax rate from 35 percent to 25 percent. Thompson says he would create just one more bracket, at 10 percent. This would apply to businesses large and small.

It’s impossible to calculate the net tax effect of Thompson’s positions on small business taxes, in part because he advocates tax simplification but hasn’t revealed which deductions he would end.

But he clearly backs a much broader tax break for business -- something that also went unmentioned by Baldwin.

Our rating

Baldwin said Thompson favors raising taxes on small businesses.

Her campaign cited Thompson’s call to repeal the federal health law, which would end a new small-business tax credit in that law. So there is an element of truth. But Baldwin ignores the tax increases that would also be eliminated by a repeal, as well as the fact Thompson would create a different version of the same tax credit.

More importantly, she skates past Thompson’s emphasis on tax cuts -- in particular his broader support for dramatically lowering income tax rates for business -- to create an opposite impression among voters.

We rate her claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DBAE80>],/factchecks/2012/oct/07/tammy-baldwin/baldwin-says-thompson-wants-raise-taxes-small-busi/

Chattanooga senator slaps virtual school company for “results at bottom of the bottom""
","
As Tennessee continues to grow its reputation as one of the nation’s most aggressive states when it comes to implementing the latest wave of education reforms, some lawmakers remain skeptical about new laws designed to provide what proponents like to describe as ""school choice.""

Perhaps the state’s most vocal challenger to the assumptions of reformers is Andy Berke, a Democratic state senator from Chattanooga. He has penned editorial pieces opposing so-called state-funded voucher programs for students.

More recently, Berke has led the charge against the state law allowing for ""virtual schools"" to set up shop in Tennessee counties. As the 2012-13 school year began, Berke brought attention to what he described as dismal results by the K12 Inc., the publicly traded online education company that is under contract with Union County Public Schools.

In a letter to Senate education committee chairwoman Dolores Gresham, R-Somerville, Berke assailed K12’s performance and asked for an inquiry. In the statement we are examining, Berke said ""millions of dollars are flowing to K12 and all we're getting from them are results at the bottom of the bottom.""

First, some background on how virtual schools work in Tennessee, courtesy of an article from The Commercial Appeal’s education reporters, Jane Roberts:

""The K-8 academy is run by K12 Inc., the largest publicly traded online learning company. It has more than 100,000 full-time students in 30-plus states. In fiscal year 2011, revenue increased 36 percent to $522.4 million, according to the company's most recent 10K, filed in October.

""K12 contracted with Union County Schools, a tiny rural district in East Tennessee, to manage the Tennessee effort. After a heavy advertising campaign last summer, the academy opened in fall of 2011, serving about 1,800 elementary-age children who go to school sitting at home in front of their computers.

""This year, enrollment jumped to 3,000 students, including a total of 439 students from Memphis City Schools (243) and Shelby County Schools (196). The virtual academy gets the state portion of education tax revenue, which averages about $4,500 per child. As the fiscal agent, Union County schools gets about 4 percent.""

We asked Berke, a lawyer, to provide some proof to back up his statement. He passed along state documents showing budget allocations and performances in the two key metrics measured by the state’s department of education, achievement test results and value-added teaching results that measure student growth.

Budget documents and press reports show that Union County paid $5.04 million in state funds to K12 for 2011-12, and this year Union County’s share of state funding is rising 65 percent, to $8.23 million, because of those big boosts in Tennessee Virtual Academy (TVA) enrollment.

In terms of performance, a letter Berke provided from Tennessee Department of Education Commissioner Kevin Huffman shows that, on the value-added front, the TVA run by K12 did indeed land at the bottom of the bottom, with scores of 1 on a scale going to 5 and a negative-index putting student growth at the bottom of the state’s rankings.

On achievement tests, TVA showed that among students in grades 3-8, 16.4 percent scored advanced or proficient in math and 39.3 percent scored advanced or proficient in reading. Not good, by any measure, but was it the bottom of the bottom?

According to the most recent data (LINK TK), only 16 of Tennessee’s 136 school districts had fewer than 40 percent of their students scoring proficient or advanced in reading, with 13 doing worse than TVA. In math, TVA was dead last, and no other district had fewer than 21 percent of its students scoring proficient or advanced.

K12 and TVA have defended themselves in various ways. Josh Williams, TVA head of schools, suggested it was unfair to judge on just its first year of results. ""They are not a performance indicator of what we are going to do. … I'd like to have a couple of years' data to see what we can do,"" he said.

Williams also said a late start for TVA last year meant that more than half of the students enrolled after the 20th day of school.

However, even Huffman, who is very sympathetic to the ""school choice"" movement, has criticized K12’s performance, telling the Chattanooga Times-Free Press, ""Its performance is demonstrably poor.""

As Roberts pointed out in her piece, the National Education Policy Center last year released a report that was critical of K12, finding that the on-time graduation rate for K12 was 49.1 percent compared to 79.4 percent average in the states where K12 operates schools.

Our ruling

 One of the state’s leading critics of aggressive ""school choice"" reforms said the state is sending millions of dollars to a virtual-school company but getting results that are ""at the bottom of the bottom."" The numbers back him up. We rate this statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2C09C0>],/factchecks/2012/oct/07/andy-berke/chattanooga-senator-slaps-virtual-school-company-r/

Joe Kyrillos pins blame on Robert Menendez for rising national unemployment, debt and deficits
","
Republican Senate hopeful Joe Kyrillos started his pitch for the votes of New Jersey residents in November by tying national economic woes to his Democratic rival.

In his opening remarks in a debate with Democratic incumbent U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez that aired on NJTV Thursday night, Kyrillos said the ""American dream is in peril"" and ""we need to make a change.""

""Now if you think things are just fine, that things are okay here in New Jersey and across the land, well then you’ll choose my opponent again. But if you think that unemployment doubling — doubling — under his watch, the deficits quadrupling, our national debt doubling is unacceptable, then you’re going to make a change and you’ll choose me,"" said Kyrillos, a state senator from Monmouth County.

Kyrillos, for the most part, accurately reflected the economic trends since Menendez took office as a U.S. Senator in January 2006. But Kyrillos runs into trouble because as one expert said it’s ""beyond ridiculous"" to pin those increases on one senator.

Here’s how the three numbers -- unemployment, debt and deficit --  break down.

The unemployment rate stood at 4.7 percent in January 2006, according to federal labor data.

It climbed to a peak of 10 percent in October of 2009, but when Kyrillos made his statement the latest numbers showed the jobless rate was 8.1 percent. That’s less than double the 2006 rate.
The unemployment rate dropped in September to 7.8 percent, according to data released Friday morning.

As for the growth in the national debt and deficit, since 2006 the former nearly doubled and the latter quadrupled.

The gross national debt includes money the government borrowed from outside investors and foreign countries, as well as money loaned from one governmental pocket, like the Social Security Trust fund to another, like the general fund.

The gross debt was about $16.16 trillion on Thursday, up from $8.17 trillion on Jan. 18, 2006, the day Menendez was sworn into the U.S. Senate. That’s according to data from the U.S. Treasury Department.

According to the Office of Management and Budget, the budget for fiscal year 2006 had a nearly $250 billion deficit, which is the difference between incoming revenue and outgoing expenses in a year.  In 2009, the deficit hit a peak of about $1.4 trillion.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office expects the fiscal year 2012 budget deficit to be about $1.1 trillion, more than quadruple the deficit in 2006.  

But how much, if at all, is Menendez responsible for those increases?

""Placing responsibility for national economic developments on an individual Senator is beyond ridiculous,"" Alan Auerbach, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, said in an e-mail.

We have addressed similar issues in previous fact-checks, noting that governors, presidents and legislators aren’t the sole catalyst behind broad economic trends.

In his campaign kickoff speech in February, Kyrillos blamed Menendez for increased deficits during his tenure in the Senate.

We noted in that fact-check that Menendez voted for some measures -- like the stimulus program --  that fueled more spending in 2009. But federal budget experts cited the recession as a major factor behind increased deficits, so Kyrillos’ statement was rated Half True.

The same problems apply to Kyrillos’ statement in the debate. The numbers are mostly on target, but the recession played a critical role in driving up government costs and driving down employment.

Menendez's campaign manager Mike Soliman called Kyrillos' statement ""hypocritical"" because of his support for policies, like the tax cuts passed by President George W. Bush, that contributed to the debt.

Kyrillos’ campaign manager, Chapin Fay, stuck with the same refrain, saying in a statement, ""Fact is, we are worse off since Bob Menendez took office.""

Our ruling

Kyrillos said that under Menendez’s watch the nation’s unemployment rate and debt doubled and the federal budget deficit quadrupled.

While Kyrillos’s arithmetic is mostly accurate in the time since Menendez joined the Senate, it’s wrong to assign full responsibility for national economic trends on one legislator.

For that reason, we rate this claim Half True.

U.S. Senate candidate Barry Hinckley says incumbent Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a $525-billion tax hike on the middle class
","
Did U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, who characterizes himself as a champion of the middle class, vote for a $525-billion tax increase on that group?

That's one assertion in a television ad by Republican challenger Barry Hinckley.

After raising an allegation about insider trading, which Whitehouse has strongly denied, the commercial says ""Whitehouse voted to raise taxes on middle-class families."" The phrase ""$525 billion tax increase on the middle class"" flashes on the screen.

The commercial offers no further information about what Hinckley is talking about, so we asked the Hinckley campaign for its backup.

Campaign manager Patrick Sweeney said the ad refers to the Affordable Care Act, the health care plan often known as Obamacare, which Whitehouse supported. PolitiFact has examined similar claims, including one in which Hinckley declared that the law will ""add trillions of dollars in debt,"" a claim we ruled False.

The government's nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the legislation, designed to expand health coverage, will generate $525 billion in revenue. A lower estimate by Congress' nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation predicted it will bring in more than $437.8 billion. Sweeney said the ad is using the CBO estimate.

But there are a few significant facts the ad doesn't mention.

First, that's not money raised over one year. It's over 10 years, from 2010 through 2019 for legislation that is being gradually phased in. In 2019, annual revenue is expected to have risen to $88.2 billion.

Second, most of the money won't be coming from the middle class, as the ad states.

For example, a huge chunk of the revenue, $210 billion of the $437.8 billion in the Joint Committee estimate, comes from both a higher Medicare payroll tax to be paid by individuals earning more than $200,000 a year ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) and from a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income if your income is already high.

Those take effect in 2013 and are taxes that middle class families will not see.

Other taxes aren't geared to the middle class either, although all taxpayers may have to foot the bill indirectly as the extra costs are factored into the goods and services they buy.

They include a fee for pharmaceutical manufacturers and importers (which will raise an estimated $27 billion); an excise tax on manufacturers and importers of medical devices ($20 billion); and a fee on health insurance providers ($60.1 billion).

In addition, there's the excise tax on indoor tanning services (expected to raise $2.7 billion) and the stricter limit on deducting medical expenses on tax returns, which is expected to raise $15.2 billion. Both will have a more direct effect on the well-tanned or very-ill middle class.

One other element of the law that will affect the middle class is the provision of Obamacare known as the individual mandate. It requires people to pay an annual penalty if they don't buy health insurance. It takes effect in 2014, starting off at a minimum of $95 for an individual and rising to $695 per year in 2016. The U.S. Supreme Court upheld that controversial provision by characterizing it as a tax, not a penalty.

Is this a tax/penalty on the middle class?

The CBO, the source used by the Hinckley campaign, has estimated that by 2016, 55 percent of the money collected via the individual mandate will come from people with incomes in the top 20 percent, which is a family of four making roughly $120,000 or more.

So less than half the money will be coming from middle class Americans.

How much money is involved?

About $4 billion in 2016. The amount coming from the middle class and lower class: roughly $1.8 billion.

To put that in perspective, $1.8 billion is 3 percent of the $57 billion or so Obamacare will be raising from everyone in 2016.

Our ruling

Barry Hinckley said Sheldon Whitehouse voted for a ""$525 billion tax increase on the middle class.""

The ad doesn't say that it's really talking about Obamacare, and that the money is designed to help pay for health coverage for the uninsured, many of whom are in the middle class.

It also doesn't point out that the $525 billion is spread out over 10 years, through 2019. Most of it doesn't come from the middle class.  

And of the $4 billion the government expects to collect each year from people who choose not to purchase health insurance, less than half will come from the middle class.

The claim in the Hinckley ad is so ridiculously off base, we rate it Pants on Fire!

Is Laurie Monnes Anderson a registered nurse?
","
State Sen. Laurie Monnes Anderson, D-Gresham, is proud of her registered nursing credentials. She mentions it in campaign mailers, on her campaign website, on her legislative web page and in her official state Voters’ Guide statement, where she lists her occupation as ""Registered Nurse and Senator.""

Monnes Anderson is defending her seat in District 25 against Republican Scott Hansen, also a resident of Gresham, but a dentist, not a registered nurse. The Leadership Fund, which is the campaigning arm of minority Senate Republicans and would love to pick up the seat, sent a press release this week to media with this bombshell: Monnes Anderson is not a registered nurse, as she claims.

""Allowing her Registered Nurse's License to expire in 2009 is tragic,"" said Senate Republican Leader Ted Ferrioli, R-John Day, in the release. ""Claiming the nurse's credential in the primary 2012 election may be excused as an oversight, but repeating the claim in the 2012 general election seems part of the pattern of disconnect typical of someone who has been in Salem too long. Voters in District 25 deserve better.""

Well, we don’t know what voters deserve, but we had to check this out for ourselves. Did Monnes Anderson, in fact, let her license lapse in 2009? And if so, does that negate her ability to call herself a registered nurse?

We looked up Laurel Anderson in the nursing board’s online database, verified that her two-year license had expired in December 2009, and put in a call to the board to learn more about nursing licenses.

Barbara Holtry, who handles press questions for the Oregon State Board of Nursing, explained that to get a license as a registered nurse, a person must meet education, examination, practice and English language requirements, and complete a background check. Licenses are good for two years. Renewal notices are sent about 6-8 weeks before the license expires.

But here’s the critical takeaway from our conversation with Holtry. ""The bottom line is: You need to have a license to be a registered nurse in the state of Oregon,"" Holtry said.

Apparently, Monnes Anderson thought she was in compliance the entire time, until PolitiFact Oregon contacted Senate Democrats on Thursday to inquire. In an interview with us on Friday, she said she was in the process of preparing paperwork to submit to the board with her licensing application. Monnes Anderson, 66, is a retired public health nurse.

""I truly believed that my license was current from 2009 on, and I’ve always gotten reminders to renew and when I get reminders I always renew,"" she said. (At this point, she will need to apply to reactivate her license. Renewals are allowed within 60 days of expiration.)

We understand that people forget to renew their professional licenses, although it’s hard for us to fathom someone forgetting for three years.

Monnes Anderson is not a registered nurse, per the Oregon State Board of Nursing. She was a registered nurse from July 1985 to December 2009 but cannot claim to have been one at the time she submitted Voters’ Guide statements for the primary election in May or for the general election in November.

We rate the statement False, and note that her GOP opponent, Hansen, has an up-to-date professional license.",[<zip object at 0x000002809705DE00>],/factchecks/2012/oct/07/laurie-monnes-anderson/laurie-monnes-anderson-registered-nurse/

Joe Biden says Mitt Romney’s plan will raise taxes on Social Security benefits
","
Vice President Joe Biden used his podium in the retirement mecca of Boca Raton, Fla., to push the message that Mitt Romney plans to raise taxes on millions of seniors.

At a rally on Sept. 28, 2012, Biden told the crowd, ""If Gov. Romney's plan goes into effect, it can mean that everyone -- every one of you -- would be paying more on taxes on your Social Security. The average senior would have to pay $460 a year more in tax for their Social Security.""

The statement draws on an analysis by the Tax Policy Center, a joint project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution that evaluates tax proposals submitted by presidential candidates.

The Obama campaign has used the study to make a number of claims about Romney’s plan, at times leaping to a worst-case-scenario conclusion. Here, we’ll check whether Biden’s statement accurately reflects how Romney’s proposal could impact Social Security benefits.

 Romney’s tax proposal
   
Romney has not released a complete tax plan, but he has outlined some specifics on his campaign website. They include: cutting marginal rates by 20 percent on a permanent, across-the-board basis; eliminating interest, dividend and capital gains taxes for taxpayers earning less than $200,000; eliminating the estate tax; and repealing the Alternative Minimum Tax. He also has suggested these general guidelines:

• The rate cuts would be paid for without adding to the deficit.
• People at the high end ""will still pay the same share of the tax burden they’re paying now.""
• Everyone would see tax rate reductions.

Romney would also cut the corporate rate to 25 percent.

To offset those cuts, Romney has indicated that he would eliminate some common tax write-offs and deductions for people with high incomes, though he hasn’t said which ones would go away.

Digging into the plan

Knowing all that, the Tax Policy Center study attempted to discern the effect of Romney’s tax rate cuts combined with the elimination of several deductions such as the mortgage interest deduction, charitable giving deduction and the exclusion for health insurance.

To keep with Romney's guiding principles, the authors eliminated deductions and write-offs for top earners first. They determined that in order to reach the $360 billion needed to offset the rate cut, deductions would also have to be axed for people with incomes below $200,000. The effects of that were significant, the authors found. Many popular tax breaks are of greatest benefit to middle- and lower-income families, so eliminating them meant outright tax increases for everyone with incomes below $200,000.
   
This is where Biden’s Social Security claim comes in.

Couples making less than $32,000 pay no taxes on their Social Security income. Those making between $32,000 and $44,000 pay taxes on 50 percent of Social Security, while those above $44,000 are taxed on 85 percent of their benefits.

The Obama campaign pointed out that in 2010, just over 29 million income tax returns were filed with untaxed Social Security and Railroad Retirement Benefits from individuals making $200,000 or less, for a total of about $29 billion in total benefits. So the average tax benefit was $987. Under Romney’s plan, the value of the tax benefit would be reduced to $789, the campaign reasoned.

The Tax Policy Center study determined that 58 percent of middle-class taxpayers’ deductions would have to be eliminated to make Romney’s plan work. So by the Obama campaign’s math, when deductions are cut by that much, the average tax benefit on Social Security income would be further reduced to $331, the equivalent of a $458 tax increase.

The problem with that math

The bottom line of the Tax Policy Center study is that Romney can't keep all his goals based on what is known of his plan. Unless some factors are tweaked, many middle-class taxpayers would end up paying more. Romney has said repeatedly he won’t let that happen.

In addition, there are factors the study, admittedly, does not take into account. It doesn’t factor in Romney’s proposed spending cuts, or the expected economic growth that would result from the rate cuts and lead to greater revenues. In a Frequently Asked Questions fact sheet, the study’s authors acknowledge that Romney’s plan cannot be fully scored because it lacks detail. Their study, they said, examines the ""broad implications.""

They also state directly that the study does not say Romney wants to raise taxes on the middle class.

""We said that simultaneously achieving all (of his tax goals) would result in lower taxes for high-income households and thus – because of the revenue-neutrality constraint – would require raising taxes on other households,"" the authors wrote.

Donald Marron, the Tax Policy Center director, wrote on the center’s blog, ""I don’t interpret this as evidence that Gov. Romney wants to increase taxes on the middle class.""

Although Romney has not shown how he would pay for his rate cuts, he has said he will protect deductions for the middle class. His campaign has floated some vague ideas, such as capping the value of some deductions for high earners, which could be one way to keep the tax burden from increasing for those further down the income scale.

Our ruling

Biden said that under Romney’s tax plan ""the average senior would have to pay $460 a year more in tax for their Social Security.""

That figure is just one way to fill in the blanks in Romney’s largely unexplained tax proposal. It’s an average of a hypothetical, and it’s at odds with what Romney has said he’ll do, which is to protect deductions for the middle class and not raise taxes.

Biden’s comment leaps to several conclusions to arrive at the dollar figure he cites. We rate it Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096C73E40>],/factchecks/2012/oct/05/joe-biden/biden-says-romneys-plan-will-raise-taxes-social-se/

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama provided $90 billion in green energy 'breaks' in one year
","
In the battle of big numbers at the first presidential debate, Mitt Romney used one five times to attack President Barack Obama’s energy policy: $90 billion.

That was the price tag of ""breaks to the green energy world"" Obama provided ""in one year,"" Romney said.

Later, he elaborated the president had put that money ""into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1.""

So, tens of billions funneled from the Obama administration to troubled companies for alternative energy — in one year. Really?

We asked the Romney campaign about that $90 billion.

Five times

The number appears in a 2010 report from the White House Council of Economic Advisers on the American Recovery And Reinvestment Act, better known as the stimulus bill.

According to the report, $90 billion is the amount of money in the Obama law for ""clean energy investments.""

Here’s how Romney used the number in the debate.

Obama had attacked $4 billion a year in ""corporate welfare"" for the oil industry.  

(His proposed 2013 budget called for removing a handful of ""tax provisions that preferentially benefit fossil fuel production."" PolitiFact Ohio reported that the nonpartisan taxpayer watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense estimates the U.S. tax code currently contains about $5 billion in yearly tax breaks that are exclusive to the oil and gas industry.)

Romney fired back: 

So, Romney contrasted a ""tax break"" of a few billion for oil companies with ""breaks"" worth tens of billions for ""green energy."" Later in the debate, he got more specific: 
Finally, Romney drove home the number, repeating it three more times, and linking it to companies who have ""gone out of business."" 
It’s fair to say that listeners may have gotten the impression that Obama gave $90 billion in tax breaks in a single year to companies for alternative energy like solar and wind, many of which didn’t fare well.

 ‘One year’ of ‘breaks’

Back to that report about stimulus spending on clean energy.

Were there $90 billion in ""breaks""? Perhaps in a generic sense, as in — some folks caught a break by taking advantage of government spending. But not so much if Romney meant ""tax breaks"" like those for oil and gas.

Rather, the money was distributed in six different ways: private and public matching grants, tax credits, loan guarantees, direct loans and interest subsidies. Tax benefits were part of the package, but so were very different kinds of spending.

""The vast majority of the $90 billion for green energy weren't tax breaks,"" said Michael Grabell, a reporter for Pulitzer-winning site ProPublica who published a book this year on stimulus spending, Money Well Spent?

Meanwhile, the money would have been distributed over longer than one year, depending on the program. Some money — such as for high-speed rail — states still have a few years to spend, Grabell said. Weatherization projects, among the quicker programs, took two or three years. The loan guarantee program through the Department of Energy, which benefitted troubled solar panel maker Solyndra, focused on projects through September 2011.

So, Romney is off in two respects. They are not just tax breaks and they are not just for one year.

 ‘Solar and wind ... Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1’

We’ll assume Romney meant ""solar and wind"" and ""Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1,"" as merely examples of Obama’s $90 billion in green energy spending in the stimulus.

But even as examples, they’re problematic. ""Solar and wind"" investments represented comparatively small parts of the $90 billion.

Solar-panel manufacturer Solyndra and electric-battery maker Ener1, which got stimulus-backed help, qualified for less than $700 million in grants and loan guarantees, and didn’t use it all.

Fisker and Tesla — troubled electric-car companies that got loan guarantees funded with money appropriated under President George W.Bush — had nothing at all to do with the $90 billion.

So, just what did make up the $90 billion?

The Council of Economic Advisers report cited by the Romney campaign breaks the spending into eight categories. Here’s the majority of it:
  

That’s more than 60 percent of the $90 billion Romney’s campaign said he was talking about. Much of it funneled through state and local governments to contractors for specific projects, rather than as breaks directly for companies.

Less than 40 percent of the $90 billion included was for things such as the installation of wind turbines and solar panels, supporting American manufacturing of advanced batteries and other advanced vehicle technology, research and development of clean coal technology and a few billion in tax credits for alternative energy.

Those investments are more in line with Romney’s characterization. But they represent less than half the ""$90 billion"" he repeatedly mentioned.

Why does it matter if Romney mischaracterized how the money was used, as long as it went to clean energy? He draws a conclusion about winners and losers, and says, ""and these businesses, many of them have gone out of business.""

It’s a claim that our colleagues at FactCheck.org addressed this week, pointing out that might be true of companies that got loan guarantees in a single year — a sliver of a sliver of the money that Romney’s talking about. But less than 12 percent of the 26 companies that ultimately benefited from the program filed for bankruptcy, FactCheck.org reported.

And the entire loan guarantee program represented just a few billion of the $90 billion investment outlined by the Council of Economic Advisors.

""A very small percentage of all the companies that benefited from the $90 billion in green job spending have gone out of business,"" said Grabell, the author of Money Well Spent? ""Not half of them. Not even half of the loan guarantees. ""

 Our ruling

Romney used the number ""$90 billion"" five times in the first presidential debate, claiming, ""In one year, (Obama) provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world … into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tesla and Ener1.""

That is incorrect in several ways. That $90 billion, as described in a report provided by the Romney campaign, wasn’t provided in one year, wasn’t distributed primarily via tax breaks, wasn’t primarily provided directly to companies, wasn’t primarily spent on solar and wind, and wasn’t spent at all on Fisker or Tesla.

In reality, more than 60 percent of it was directed to state and local governments and utility companies for energy efficiency, transportation and electrical infrastructure .

Obama says 50 million lose coverage if Obamacare is repealed
","
Both President Barack Obama and Republican Mitt Romney say they want more Americans to have affordable health insurance. That’s about where their agreement ends.

In the first debate of the general election, the candidates sparred about how best to improve the health care system, with Romney calling for a repeal of Obamacare, and Obama defending the reform law.

""Gov. Romney says we should replace (Obamacare)... But the problem is, he hasn't described what exactly we'd replace it with, other than saying we're going to leave it to the states,"" Obama said. ""But the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he's offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there's no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who's got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it's estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance.""

It’s that last line that grabbed our attention: 50 million people losing their health coverage if Obamacare is repealed. We decided to check it out.

The two plans

Obama’s health care law seeks health coverage for every American by requiring most Americans to obtain coverage or face a fine. To help people meet that requirement, it expands Medicaid for the poor, provides subsidies for people of modest means to buy insurance and requires businesses to provide employee insurance. It also creates exchanges where individuals and businesses can purchase private policies.

Government analysts predict that as the law is implemented, the number of uninsured Americans will decline. Opponents argue that it imposes new taxes on families and businesses and could discourage hiring.

Romney has pledged to repeal the law. He has offered a general outline of what he would replace it with, though with few specifics. His campaign website says he will limit requirements on private insurance and Medicaid, encourage ""flexibility"" in the market and convert Medicaid to a block grant program administered by the states. In speeches, he has also said he would provide an income tax deduction for the cost of purchasing insurance.

The projections

If Romney wins the election and acts to repeal Obamacare on Day 1, there is no accounting that shows 50 million people losing their insurance right away. Obama didn’t say so, but his statement referred to projections out to 2022.

That said, the Congressional Budget Office predicts that Obamacare will reduce the number of uninsured. Without the law, the CBO says there will be a total of 60 million uninsured Americans by 2022. With the law, that number will be only 30 million.

So if Obamacare is repealed, that’s 30 million people without insurance as a result.

The remainder of Obama’s 50-million number originates with a study gauging the impact of Romney’s plan.

Edwin Park, vice president for health policy at the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said Romney has suggested converting Medicaid, the health program for the poor, to block grants, with a cap on federal funding of inflation plus 1 percentage point. That’s similar to the budget proposed by vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan, versions of which passed the House this year and last. (We should note that any move to turn Medicaid into a block grant would require new legislation passed by Congress.)

Both proposals, Park said, fall short of Medicaid’s current growth rate.

""We’re talking a big gap between what Medicaid would be scheduled to grow at vs. what it would be under the block grant,"" Park said. The Ryan budget, he said, cuts $810 billion from the program over 10 years. (Campaign finance records show that Park has donated $350 to the Obama campaign.)

The Urban Institute, a think tank that studies health policy and social programs, determined that the cuts will force states to tighten eligibility for the program, leading to between 14 million and 27 million people being dropped.

Another study, written for the liberal organization FamiliesUSA, also concluded that Romney’s plan for Medicaid would end up pushing people out of the program. To estimate how many, author Jonathan Gruber, who was an architect of both Romney’s health plan in Massachusetts and of Obamacare, said he assumed in the study that states would find a way to absorb 25 percent of the cuts (by becoming more efficient, cutting down on overhead, etc.) but that the rest would have to be made up by tightening eligibility and dropping Medicaid recipients.

He found that by 2022, 18 million more people would be uninsured. In a second study, Gruber assumed greater savings by the states -- 50 percent -- in absorbing the Medicaid cuts before dropping people, and determined that 12 million more people would lack health insurance.

""The bottom line is it depends on assumptions you make, but no matter what you do it’s going to be a huge difference in the number of uninsured,"" Gruber said.

The counter arguments

Yuval Levin, a fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center, said the studies fail to account for the Medicare cuts, tax increases, and increased premium costs in Obamacare, ""and so presents a description of the law’s effects on the health care system that is badly skewed.""

With Medicaid, Levin said it’s ""high implausible"" that states would drop people upon implementing the block grant, which will also create unaccounted for savings.

""This all leads them to the implausible conclusion that Romney’s extensive efforts to expand insurance coverage (through purchasing pools, the transformation of the tax treatment of coverage, purchasing across state lines, co-insurance, expanded health savings accounts, protections for people with pre-existing conditions, etc.) would result in less rather than more coverage,"" Levin said. (Campaign records show he donated $2,467 to the Romney campaign and $200 to the Republican National Committee.)

Joseph Antos, a scholar with the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said he found flaws with the assumptions about Obamacare’s impact.

""FamiliesUSA assumes that all states fully expand Medicaid, despite the Supreme Court ruling that they cannot be penalized by losing all federal funds if they do not do it. Obviously, the poorer states won’t expand in that case—that 100 percent fed funding disappears in a few years, and the states then begin paying, and many haven’t figured out how to cover teachers pensions yet,"" Antos said in an email. ""They also assume that states will fully implement the exchanges on time. That is also not going to happen. Some will, some won’t.""

""Conclusion: far fewer than 32.9 million will be covered by Obamacare.""

Our ruling

Obama said in the debate that by repealing Obamacare, ""you're looking at 50 million people losing health insurance."" He didn’t say so, but that figure is based on projections for a decade down the road, and it applies to people who don't have insurance now. If Romney repeals the health care law, some of those people will not have actually gotten coverage.

And, only about 30 million to 32.9 million people would lose coverage by 2022 if Obamacare was simply repealed. An additional 18 million people might lose coverage if Romney achieves his plan of converting Medicaid to a block grant, according to some studies.

Obama’s number assumes the worst about the possible effect of Romney’s plan, whose stated purpose is to get more people covered. And some critics say the promise of Obamacare is inflated -- that not so many people will gain coverage, therefore not so many would lose it if the law is repealed.

Obama is right that repealing the health care law will result in millions losing coverage, but his statement is an oversimplification of long-term projections and includes more than just a simple repeal of the 2010 law.

Mitt Romney says Barack Obama has 'doubled' the deficit
","During the first presidential debate in Denver, Mitt Romney took President Barack Obama to task for his record on the deficit.

""The president said he’d cut the deficit in half,"" Romney said. ""Unfortunately, he doubled it.""

We already ruled the first half of this statement True, noting that Obama said on Feb. 23, 2009, ""Today I am pledging to cut the deficit we inherited in half by the end of my first term in office.""

But what about Romney’s second claim, that Obama ""doubled"" the deficit he inherited?

Romney is way off.

The final Congressional Budget Office baseline deficit projection before Obama took office -- noted in table 5 in this January 2009 CBO report -- showed a fiscal year 2009 deficit of $1.19 trillion.

That figure doesn’t account for any of Obama’s own spending initiatives, such as the stimulus bill. But the deficit grew quickly under Obama: The fiscal 2009 deficit rose to $1.41 trillion and has remained above $1 trillion annually ever since.

But compared to what Obama inherited, the annual deficit has gone down slightly. CBO projects that for fiscal 2012, which has just ended, the fiscal 2012 deficit will be $1.09 trillion.

So, far from doubling the deficit, Obama (along with, it should be noted, some Republican help in Congress) has instead reduced the deficit by about 8 percent.

The only way to get to doubling is to use a different starting point, which is what the Romney campaign does. His campaign compares the current deficit to the final fiscal 2008 deficit of $458.6 billion.

But we don't find that to be the correct starting point.

Romney was referring to a statement Obama made on Feb. 23, 2009, so the correct comparison would be the deficit at that point. The 2008 deficit covered a fiscal year that ended about four months before Obama took office -- and which was also a period of rapid economic deterioration that affected the scale of CBO’s deficit projections. So CBO’s January 2009 figure offers a much more accurate indication of what Obama ""inherited"" -- which, we should repeat, is the word Obama used in his broken promise of February 2009.

Romney would still have been off if he had said the federal debt, rather than deficit, had doubled on Obama’s watch. The debt held by the public -- one of two key measures of federal debt -- rose from $6.3 trillion on Jan. 20, 2009, to $11.3 trillion on the day of the debate, an increase of 79 percent. The total federal debt, which includes debt the government holds itself, rose by a smaller amount over that period, 53 percent.

Our ruling

Romney said that Obama has ""doubled"" the deficit. In reality, using the most appropriate comparison, he and Congress have actually decreased the deficit slightly. We rate Romney’s statement False.

"['Oregon', 'Taxes', 'Kurt Schrader']","
Are tax revenues the lowest they've been since World War II?
","
Rep. Kurt Schrader, D-Ore., bills himself as a budget hawk, a persistent agitator for getting the nation’s debt under control. He also speaks frequently about the broken federal tax code.

Those two concepts came together on Sept. 13 when Schrader wrote in an e-newsletter that Congress should go ""big"" this winter when devising a way to avoid the so-called ""fiscal cliff,"" the spending cuts and tax increases that go into effect automatically early next year if Congress does nothing.

Schrader has been preaching this for months. But in the newsletter he offered a new argument for re-working the tax code as part of the exercise. One big reason comprehensive tax reform is needed, he wrote is, ""Tax revenues are the lowest they have been since World War II and need to increase through comprehensive tax reform.""

That’s quite an interesting and emphatic statement; exactly the kind that gets our attention at PolitiFact Oregon.

The first part is especially worth a look - ""Tax revenues are the lowest they have been since World War II"" -  because that claim and some variation of it will be heard often when Congress begins debating tax reform later this year.

But what does he mean?

To the average person, revenue usually means dollars. If that’s the case, Schrader could not be more wrong. How wrong? Try this. In 1945, federal revenue was $45.1 billion, according to the Office of Management and Budget. By 2010 OMB records show that number had exploded to $2.2 trillion because the nation’s economy grew at a record pace.

But wait. Schrader’s spokesman, Cody Tucker, says that’s not the comparison the congressman is making. Tucker said the statement is based on calculations of revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP). Schrader’s claim compares revenues from federal income taxes, Social Security and assorted excise taxes, Tucker said, and uses the 2010 fiscal year as an endpoint because that’s the last year for actual data.

None of that is spelled out - or even hinted - in the newsletter.

Linking revenue to gross domestic product, which is the total value of all goods and services the country produces, is a standard and accepted way of comparing economic variables over time. It’s a common tool used by economists and budget wonks on Capitol Hill so one year can be accurately compared to other years.

PolitiFact Oregon has no fear of wonky data. And we’re in luck here because this kind of baseline data is what economists are born to collect and collate, analyze and evaluate. Interest groups specializing in federal budget, including the conservative Heritage Foundation and non-partisan Tax Policy Center do it. Non-partisan outfits including the Congressional Budget Office do it.

So does OMB, which provides a handy year-by-year summary of federal revenue as a percentage of GDP going back to 1930. In that year, the percentage was 4.2 percent.

Schrader says in his comment that revenue is the lowest since the end of World War II. That would be 1945. And sure enough, the percentage that year had jumped to 20.4 percent, reflecting the cost of the war and the nation’s singular focus on winning no matter the cost.

In 1950, federal receipts as a percentage of GDP amounted to 14.4 percent. During the subsequent six decades, the share typically hovered between 16 percent and 20 percent. By fiscal year 2010, it was 14.9 percent of GDP.

All of those years are higher - or equal - to 2010.

Schrader is correct on 2010 compared to 1945. And he’s correct about the years in between.

But the reader shouldn’t have to call his office or OMB or some economist for an explanation.

He doesn’t specify that he’s referring to revenue as a percentage of GDP. He’s not explicit about when the period starts (1945?) and when it ends (2010?). That’s important because OMB projections say revenue will jump to 16.6 percent of GDP in 2012 and 17.9 percent in 2013. Both of those are higher and thus dent Schrader’s argument.

He also fails to point out another important caveat - that absolute levels of federal tax revenues collected in many of the most recent years have been at or near record levels even though the percentage remains low. That’s because the overall economy has grown, too.

All of this muddles the message and leaves out important context. And to find the real result Schrader asks readers to do far too much work. For that reason, we rate this claim: Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979FE500>],/factchecks/2012/oct/05/kurt-schrader/are-tax-revenues-lowest-theyve-been-world-war-ii/

U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta wrong on Shea-Porter's small business support
","
U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta and his challenger, former Congresswoman Carol Shea-Porter, have been going back and forth over veterans in recent weeks.

In response to an ad from Shea-Porter accusing him of voting to cut funding for veterans, Guinta released an advertisement of his own on Sept. 25, charging his opponent with failing to support small businesses.

""Carol Shea-Porter? She wants to increase taxes on small business and job creators,"" a narrator reads in the ad, aired on WMUR-TV, among other stations.

""Higher taxes, fewer jobs,"" the ad reads, showing a faded picture of her face.

To our knowledge, Shea-Porter has not advocated throughout this or any previous campaign to raise taxes on small business. So, we decided to check her record.

During her time in Congress, Shea-Porter voted in favor of the Hiring Incentives to Restore Employment Act (known commonly as the HIRE Act of 2009), which offered a payroll tax exemption and new hire retention credit to businesses who hire and retain unemployed workers, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

And before she left office the next year, Shea-Porter voted in favor of the Small Business Jobs Act, which, as noted in past PolitiFact rulings, featured eight tax cuts for small businesses, including new and greater deductions for business start-up expenses, cell phone use and health care costs for the self-employed, among others.

These votes, along with her support for the federal stimulus package and its $400 tax cut for individual workers (and $800 for working couples), seem to indicate support from Shea-Porter for small businesses. So, we asked the Guinta campaign what they were referring to in the ad.

In response, the campaign directed us to a letter Shea-Porter signed onto before she left Congress.

The letter, sent Dec. 9, 2010 to U.S. Rep. Nancy Pelosi, urged the then-Speaker not to accept the House Republicans push to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for all taxpayers, but to rescind the tax breaks for those making more than $200,000 a year, or as they said in the letter, ""millionaires and billionaires.""

""First, it is fiscally irresponsible,"" Shea-Porter and 53 other Congressmen and women wrote at the time. ""Second, it is grossly unfair. (It) will hurt, not help, the majority of Americans in the middle class and those working hard to get there.""

Despite their pleas, the House of Representatives agreed to extend all the cuts for two years, approving the matter Dec. 16, 2010 in the form of the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act. President Barack Obama signed the bill into law one day later, and it’s a good thing he did, according to Guinta’s campaign. Like the current situation - the tax cuts are set to expire once again at the end of the year -- failing to extend the cuts would have led to higher taxes on small businesses across the country, Guinta suggested.

We’ve heard similar claims before. In November 2010, less than a month before Shea-Porter and her colleagues sent the letter to Pelosi, U.S. Rep. Eric Cantor, now the House Majority Leader, earned a Barely True rating (now Mostly False) for saying the expiration of the tax cuts will raise small business taxes.

The question then, just as now, is how many businesses are we talking about.

At the time, Cantor referred to an oft-cited Treasury Department report that determined about 75 percent of the nation’s wealthiest taxpayers are ""flow through-business owners"" who claim some of their earnings through partnerships, sole proprietorship or other form of business income.

The 2007 report did not indicate that all these taxpayers are small business owners, however. Rather, this income could be linked to ""anyone who earned money from a source other than a regular job, such as consulting or public speaking,"" PolitiFact ruled at the time.

""It could also be reported by those who make most of their income from partnerships such as law firms and medical practices,"" according to PolitiFact’s previous reporting. ""And it could include investors who have very little involvement in the day-to-day operations of a company.""

Now, two years later, this still holds true, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The category includes many business entities that are not small and others that are not businesses at all, CBPP analysts .Chye-Ching Huang and Chuck Marr wrote in a July report, ""Allowing High-Income Bush Tax Cuts to Expire Would Affect Few Businesses.""

""For example, taxpayers can create pass-through entities simply as a vehicle to invest in other businesses,"" they wrote. ""Pass-through income also includes income from the incidental rental of a vacation home.""

According to the CBPP analysis, only 2.5 percent of small business owners, and 7.9 percent of taxpayers who receive any income from small businesses, qualify for the top two tax rates.

The Tax Foundation, a more conservative, business-backed organization, contends that, however few, those higher earning businesses earn most, up to 72 percent, of total business income.

""Small business owners can end up with what seem like very high annual incomes,"" foundation spokesman Richard Morrison wrote in an email, ""but because most of that money needs to be put back into the business in order to stay afloat, they often end up both paying taxes in the top bracket ... with relatively little in actual personal income at the end of the year.""

Still, CBPP argues that the small number of businesses qualifying for the top income brackets means the Bush-tax cuts have little effect on small business.

""Very few of the high-income taxpayers who benefit from the upper-income tax cuts are in fact ‘small businesses’ in the way the term is commonly understood,"" Huang and Marr wrote in their report. ""Policymakers ought not let myths and lobbyists’ slogans regarding high-income taxpayers and small businesses drive them toward a costly policy that would add heavily to deficits while delivering little economic benefit.""

Our ruling:

As Guinta suggests, Shea-Porter both lobbied and voted against extending the Bush tax cuts before she left office in 2010, calling the matter ""fiscally irresponsible"" and ""grossly unfair"" to middle class Americans.

Despite Guinta’s claims, however, nowhere in the letter did Shea-Porter mention wanting to raise taxes on small businesses, nor do analyses suggest that eliminating the tax cuts for the highest income earners would have affected many business owners

In votes relating more to small business, Shea-Porter offered support for the HIRE Act and the Small Business Act, among others. In total, her record shows no evidence of ""wanting to increase taxes on small businesses,"" not now or during her time in office.

We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975BDD00>],/factchecks/2012/oct/05/frank-guinta/us-rep-frank-guinta-wrong-shea-porters-small-busin/
"['National', 'Debates', 'Health Care', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says his health care plan covers pre-existing conditions
","
If there’s one thing people tell pollsters they like about ""Obamacare,"" it’s the rule that says health insurance companies can no longer reject people for having pre-existing conditions.

Republican nominee Mitt Romney said it’s an aspect of the health care law he wants to keep if elected president.

""Pre-existing conditions are covered under my plan,"" Romney noted at the debate in Denver on Oct. 3.

President Barack Obama challenged Romney on that point. ""Well, actually, governor, that isn't what your plan does,"" Obama said. ""What your plan does is to duplicate what's already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can't deny you if it's been under 90 days. But that's already the law, and that doesn't help the millions of people out there with pre-existing conditions.""

Romney responded by simply repeating his earlier point: ""In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That's part of my health care plan.""

So what’s the truth? Does Romney have a plan to help people with pre-existing conditions?

‘Obamacare’ vs. the Romney plan
   
The real name of the current health care law is the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. At the debate, Romney called ""Obamacare,"" and Obama replied that he didn’t mind the term and had actually ""become fond"" of it.

Under ""Obamacare,"" which goes into effect fully in 2014, insurers can’t reject people for having pre-existing conditions.

During the drafting of the law, insurers warned that the provision could drive them out of business if people can wait until they get sick to buy insurance. So to address that concern, the law requires everyone to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty. That penalty clause is called ""the individual mandate,"" and the Supreme Court ruled it constitutional this summer.

Romney opposes that mandate, and has consistently said the health law should be repealed and replaced. But his health care plan doesn’t pack a lot of details.

His website, though, says people ""should be guaranteed the ability to retain coverage"" if they have ""maintained continuous health insurance coverage."" That means if you already have health insurance, other insurers can’t deny you if you have pre-existing conditions. (After the debate, his spokesman confirmed this was still his position.)

But people who’ve lost coverage for an extended period of time don’t get the same guarantee.

 How many people would that be? The Obama campaign has said it could be as many as 89 million, a claim we rated Half True. That number is inflated — it counts people who would qualify for public insurance programs, for example.

Still, anyone who does go without coverage for an extended period of time and then needs to buy their own insurance could be rejected by private insurers under Romney’s plan.

Obama said during the debate existing law already has protections similar as to what Romney has proposed, and he’s right about that.

If the 2010 health law disappeared, a 1996 law protects most people from denial after gaps of less than 63 days. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act established that time frame, and it only allows insurers to look back 18 months for coverage gaps of 63 days or more.

Health experts we talked to assume Romney would basically firm up the requirements of that law — which applies primarily to people with employer-based coverage, not less common individual policies — and strengthen it so it also applied to the individual market.

It’s also possible under Romney’s plan that some people rejected for coverage for pre-existing conditions would qualify for insurance through state-run ""high-risk pools,"" an idea Romney includes in his health care proposals. Romney encourages states to design their own programs, according to a statement from policy director Lanhee Chen that the Romney campaign sent us.

Conservative health experts say Romney’s reforms focus on separating health insurance from employment, and that will cut down on gaps in health coverage.
   
""The idea is that you create a new system in which it's much easier to get insurance yourself, give people a window (a kind of open season) to get insured in that system if they're not already insured, and then after that protect those who are from then on continuously insured,"" said Yuval Levin, a fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center and founding editor of conservative magazine National Review.
   
Our ruling
   
Romney said his health care proposals include protections for pre-existing conditions What he didn’t say at the debate -- but which his website states and advisers confirmed after the debate -- is that people would be protected from denial only if they have been continuously insured.
   
The health care law, though, offers protections whether people have current coverage or not, so it offers more robust protection. The law also includes a requirement that everyone have insurance or pay a tax penalty. Romney’s plan doesn’t have that requirement.

Romney did not mention the qualifier that people have to stay insured to get the protection. That’s a significant omission. We rate his statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FE8800>],/factchecks/2012/oct/05/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-his-health-care-plan-covers-pre-e/
