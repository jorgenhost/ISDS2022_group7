Negative campaigning? Not me, says Bill McCollum
","
Bill McCollum tried to put his tougher-than-expected Republican primary for governor into perspective during a discussion with reporters in Tallahassee on July 29, 2010.

Here's the upshot: Rick Scott has spent millions of dollars crafting a negative lie-filled television campaign that has distorted voters' impressions of both Scott and McCollum, and voters don't yet have the full story.

Asked what he needs to do to turn his campaign around ahead of the Aug. 24 primary, McCollum told reporters, ""I'm simply going to be telling the truth about myself. This man's been telling lies on television with millions of dollars for weeks now. And I'm going to get an opportunity to finally spend my own money where I talk about the governor's race.""

Later, when reporters suggested that McCollum hasn't exactly been Mr. Clean Campaigner himself, the candidate bristled.

""Well, look, there's no negative advertising in my campaign at all,"" McCollum said. ""Some of the outside groups have been running advertising that are pointing out the truth about Mr. Scott and that's not negative.""

No negative advertising at all? As slightly more than casual observers in the governor's race, we found McCollum's statement puzzling. To us, the Scott-McCollum primary duel has been filled with plenty of vitriol -- on both sides -- for the better part of three months.

We decided to put our recollection to the test.

Let's go to the tapes.

First, we need to mention that McCollum's initial TV ad was plenty nice. It features the endorsement of former Gov. Jeb Bush and highlights parts of McCollum's record as attorney general and his 500,000 jobs plan. The ad, you can see it here, includes the traditional images of McCollum speaking with groups of voters and then walking and seemingly giving orders or instructions to worker-type folks.

McCollum's second TV ad directly takes on Scott, a former health care CEO who is self-financing his tea party-inspired campaign.

The ad starts by playing a soundbite from Scott's own ads. Then, McCollum jumps in.

""Rick Scott, let's get real. While your hospitals were profiting from abortions, I voted 100 percent pro-life.

""You cashed in helping illegals send American dollars to Mexico. I led the conservative fight to secure our borders and against amnesty.

""And while you pocketed $300 million by ripping off taxpayers, as attorney general, I recovered record millions from Medicaid fraud.

""You put profit over principle, and that's wrong.""

But it's McCollum's next TV ad that comes with all the hallmarks of negative campaigning -- namely grainy photos, haunted house-style music, text flying across the screen, and nary a mention of McCollum.

The ad is labeled ""Innertube"" by the McCollum campaign.

""He's a special interest insider whose company defrauded Medicare and taxpayers while he pocketed $300 million,"" a narrator says.

In another frame of the ad, a narrator says that while Scott has publicly opposed the federal stimulus, he's involved in companies who received stimulus funds. The claim comes with three images -- stacks of money kind of flopping in a breeze, a screen grab of President Barack Obama and then a screen grab of Scott.

There's more:

June 10: The St. Petersburg Times gets a hold of a McCollum mailer that is attempting to attack Scott on his abortion position. The front of the mailer has a woman slumped with her back against an industrial style wall, covering her face and pulling her hair. In big red letters that could give a voter the impression of blood, the mailer begins, ""It's a shame,"" then continues in white lettering, ""it's clear when it comes to pro-life issues, Rick Scott is ruthless -- his bottom line comes first."" The mailer continues on the back, with more blood-red type, by saying that Scott profited from abortions as CEO of the hospital chain, Columbia/HCA.

June 27: A robocall from the McCollum campaign:
""Meet Mr. Slick -- Rick Scott.
""He's been busted twice this week by Florida newspapers for telling whoppers about Bill McCollum.  According to the experts, Mr. Slick -- Rick Scott -- and his campaign have been lying about Bill McCollum's position on the issues of abortion and immigration.
""Between Obama and Crist, Floridians are tired of typical politicians willing to say anything to be elected. In August Republicans have a choice. Let's restore principled conservative leadership to Tallahassee. Vote for Bill McCollum."" 
June 28: A fundraising letter by McCollum calls Scott a ""disgraced"" and ""lousy manager"" whose hands are ""filthy"" regarding Medicaid fraud at Columbia/HCA. ""He's lucky he's not in prison,"" McCollum writes in the letter. ""And now with a shameless audacity that would make Bill Clinton blush, he says he wants to bring his business savvy and acumen to Tallahassee.""

July 2: In a web ad, the McCollum campaign says Scott's excuse -- that he didn't know about the fraud at Columbia/HCA -- is ""like saying a mafia kingpin doesn't know about his henchmen's crimes."" As the narrator says the line, a floating head of Scott is given a black fedora and a trench coat. Then money starts flying through the frame of the ad. Then Scott starts to spin in circles and gets bigger. Then someone starts laughing.

July 15: A new mailer, called the Two Faces of Rick Scott doesn't include any mention of McCollum. Instead, it claims that ""Rick Scott's company is partners with Playboy"" (which PolitiFact Florida rated Barely True) and that ""Rick Scott's company creates products for the gambling industry.""

July 27: A new web ad attacks Scott's time at Columbia/HCA, saying he got a $310 million golden parachute ""courtesy of American taxpayers."" The $310 million represents Scott's severance package when he left Columbia/HCA. The ad is set to Rick Astley's song, ""Never Gonna Give You Up,"" which has become part of a Internet fad called ""Rickrolling,"" where people think they're watching one thing, then get bait-and-switched with Astley's song.

We should note that these are all advertisements by McCollum's campaign, and not the 527 groups that are supporting his candidacy. That means McCollum has final approval over their content. And we should make clear that Scott's hands aren't clean himself (See here, here and here, for starters).

Determining whether McCollum's ads are all truly ""negative,"" or rather what politicians like to call ""contrast"" ads, is something of a subjective exercise. Contrast ads typically say things like ""Candidate A is for this, well I'm for that."" Or, ""Candidate A says he'll be tough on crime, but he voted for this."" Leaving some room for leeway, we don't want to make a blanket statement that everything we found should be classified as negative.

But calling your opponent Mr. Slick, or dressing him up in a fedora and trench coat meets a common-sense definition of negative advertising. So does an abortion mailer with blood-red type, or a TV ad that focuses entirely on your opponent, and uses gimmicks like spooky music and grainy photos. McCollum said ""there's no negative advertising in my campaign at all."" But there's plenty of evidence to the contrary, and a seasoned campaigner like McCollum has to know it. We rate his claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE984C0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/29/bill-mccollum/negative-campaigning-not-me-says-bill-mccollum/
"['Message Machine 2010', 'Oil Spill', 'Florida', 'Dave Aronberg']","
Dave Aronberg says he was 'first' to demand BP escrow fund
","
In the wake of the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon oil rig explosion, Florida politicians have been boasting about their own responses to the disaster. State Sen. Dave Aronberg, a Democratic candidate for attorney general, said in a campaign mailer that hit mailboxes this week that he ""was the first to demand that BP create a billion-dollar fund to pay for the devastation."" 
PolitiFact Florida previously ruled on a similar claim by Democratic political consultant James Carville that CFO Alex Sink, a Democrat running for governor, was the ""first official who said that BP should pay $25 million for an ad campaign to promote Florida tourism."" We found two state legislators who raised the issue of BP funding tourism ads before Sink did.

So we wondered, was Aronberg the first to call for BP to pay for a $1 billion escrow account?

First, we contacted Aronberg's campaign to ask what he meant by ""first"" since the ad didn't explain. The first politician in Florida, the first attorney general candidate or some other first? Campaign spokeswoman Allison North Jones said that the mailer referred to the first state legislator or member of Florida's Cabinet.

Aronberg wrote a letter to Gov. Charlie Crist on May 5, asking that Crist reach out to BP and the other firms involved in the explosion to ask them to set up a $1 billion escrow account.

""With the representatives of these three firms actively engaged on the rig’s activities at the time of the Deepwater explosion, it seems obvious that all three should be stepping up to the plate of financial responsibility,"" Aronberg wrote. ""While the $25 million BP has offered to our state is a start, it is by no means sufficient."" The letter goes on: ""Florida should be insisting that an interest-bearing escrow account by established, under the control of the Cabinet or CFO, with each responsible party in this disaster committing a share to total $1 billion. The funds would be drawn down to fund preparations and prevention, wildlife recovery, loss to the local fishing industries, and mitigation as the damage rolls in.""

We asked Jones how the campaign determined Aronberg was first. She said that in Aronberg's role as chair of the Senate's Committee on Military Affairs and Domestic Security, he regularly received briefings on ""what public officials were or were not doing in terms of response to the cleanup and any recommendations on how to hold BP accountable. In May he really felt the need to do something to make sure the money was tied up for the state to pay for the cleanup. That's when he came up with the idea for the escrow."" 
Jones pointed to a June 14 Miami Herald Naked Politics blog that criticized Attorney General Bill McCollum for taking credit when President Barack Obama called for BP to establish the escrow account. McCollum sent a press release stating ""Obama has followed McCollum's lead,"" according to the blog. 
""But really, McCollum followed the lead of state Sen. Dave Aronberg, a Democrat running for attorney general,"" Naked Politics wrote. ""In a May 5 letter to Gov. Charlie Crist, Aronberg wrote that 'Florida should be insisting that an interest-bearing escrow account be established, under the control of the Cabinet or CFO, with each responsible party in this disaster committing a share to total $1 billion.' (The total is smaller than the one McCollum proposed, but it was also much earlier in the crisis.)"" 
Although the blog puts Aronberg ahead of McCollum, it doesn't rule out other politicians. While Aronberg's campaign -- after the fact -- said that by ""first"" they meant state legislators or Cabinet members, in this Florida election season with candidates everywhere, we think the average voter could assume ""first"" refers to any politician or candidate. 
When we searched news articles, we found only one reference to a Florida politician asking for BP to provide an escrow fund before Aronberg: Republican Congressman Jeff Miller, who represents the Pensacola area. 
A May 4, 2010, article in the Pensacola News Journal quoted Miller at a May 3 press conference at the Mobile Regional airport. Miller said: ""And we are asking BP to put money in an escrow fund so local governments, if possible, can draw upon it."" Miller said the escrow fund was needed because many local governments are having to dip into their reserve funds to spend money for the disaster. 
Miller was not quoted as asking for a specific amount for the escrow fund. He made the statement accompanied by Florida Sen. George LeMieux and Alabama senators. 
We e-mailed Miller's spokesman to ask if May 3 was the first time he brought it up and whether he had also put a dollar amount on it by that point. Dan McFaul said Miller had a phone conversation with David Nagel, a top BP executive, on May 3 asking for a $1 billion escrow account. Miller reiterated his request in an in-person meeting with Nagel May 6 and in a letter May 10. We e-mailed BP in an attempt to verify the May 3 conversation. BP spokeswoman Kathleen Randall said that she left a message for Nagel about it but he was out of the office. 
We also reached out to LeMieux's office -- and Sen. Bill Nelson's office -- to ask if either had made a similar request. LeMieux sent a letter to BP on May 11 asking that it provide $1 billion to the gulf states. Nelson spokesman Dan McLaughlin wasn't certain when Nelson first raised the topic of an escrow account.

""I think Bill may have even discussed the concept with Tony Hayward during a May 4 meeting here between the two,"" McLaughlin said. ""But I don’t think we made any 'official' public request in writing for money in such a fund until we had a better idea of the scope of the damages and until the president was preparing to sit down to negotiate with BP. That would be our letter in early June seeking $20 billion. Within a week or so after that, BP did agree to the $20 billion figure."" 
We also contacted Florida's Cabinet. CFO Alex Sink, Agriculture Commissioner Charles Bronson and Gov. Charlie Crist asked either BP or the federal government to help Florida pay for activities related to the disaster, but none made a request for an escrow account. 
Finally, we contacted Hope Lanier, a BP spokeswoman who helped us determine who the first official was to ask BP to pay for tourism ads. She said she had no information related to Aronberg's claim. 
""I don't have any reason to believe that it's inaccurate,'' she said. ""I'm unaware of anything that would dispute it one way or another."" 
After a meeting with Obama, BP agreed to establish a $20 billion claims fund, according to a June 16 BP press release. 
Aronberg said he was the ""first"" to call for a $1 billion escrow fund but didn't define first -- although his campaign said that meant first state legislator or Cabinet member. There's no certain way to rule Aronberg first among state legislators without contacting every legislator. We didn't find anything showing any Cabinet members demanding an escrow fund before Aronberg, who wrote his letter May 5. We did find evidence that Florida Congressman Jeff Miller asked for an escrow fund May 3. Aronberg should have been more precise in his mailer, such as ""first state legislator."" For that omission, we give him a Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBEED040>],/factchecks/2010/jul/29/dave-aronberg/aronberg-says-he-was-first-demand-bp-escrow-fund/

Mark Dayton says Gov. Tim Pawlenty cut education spending
","
Minnesota governor and potential Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty's decision not to run for re-election this fall sparked a contentious gubernatorial battle in the North Star State. With the Aug. 10 primaries nearing, the candidates took their attacks to the airwaves.

Still facing opponents in his own party primary, Democratic-Farmer-Labor frontrunner Mark Dayton started swinging at Republicans in a television ad criticizing Pawlenty's education policies.

Behind sunny images of children in classrooms and on school buses, smiling or talking with Dayton, a voice intones, ""Tim Pawlenty has cut education funding in Minnesota. Classrooms are overcrowded. Districts have gone to four-day school weeks.""

A quick study of a Department of Education survey showed that Minnesota's elementary and secondary classrooms are more crowded than classrooms in at least two-thirds of other states. The state's average class size is also significantly larger than the national average.

It was also easy to verify Dayton’s claim that school districts have gone to four-day weeks. At least 10 districts have had four-day schedules for at least a year, and another two are considering such a switch. Most superintendents cite a tighter state budget as the catalyst for the new schedule.

In the ad’s most provocative claim, Dayton asserted that ""Pawlenty cut funding by $1,300 a student.""

The state’s Price of Government report shows that the state budgeted just under $6.1 billion for schools in fiscal year 2003. In fiscal year 2011, the state has allocated more than $6.9 billion -- an apparent increase of almost a billion dollars. The Pawlenty administration's strict insistence on budget cuts makes that increase particularly noteworthy.

But don’t close those schoolbooks just yet.

Dayton’s campaign staff said his $1,300 figure came from research by Jeff Van Wychen, of the progressive think tank Minnesota 2020. We took a look at his calculations for ourselves.

When education expenditures are adjusted for inflation, as Van Wychen and experts say they should be, the dollars schools received in 2011 are worth less than the amount received in 2003.

Adjusted for inflation, Minnesota's 2003 school funding amounts to about $8 billion -- over $1 billion more than the $6.9 billion allocated for fiscal year 2011.

Divided by Minnesota Department of Education attendance figures, per-student funding fell $1,300 -- from $9,700 to $8,400 between 2003 and 2011.

An important caveat: Van Wychen's calculations use a figure called a ""price deflator for state and local government purchases"" to adjust for inflation. He argues that it is superior to the Consumer Price Index, a more commonly used adjustment index, because the CPI takes into account many goods that governments never buy, and Minnesota State Economist Thomas Stinson agrees. The price deflator for state and local purchases that he uses is legislatively codified as the appropriate measure of inflation for education funding in Minnesota, according to Dayton's office.

So Dayton’s $1,300 figure is correct, when inflation is taken into account.

But Dayton’s claim that Pawlenty cut education funding is misleading. In non-inflation-adjusted dollars, education funding increased -- though perhaps not quickly enough to keep up with the cost of education in Minnesota. While the schools' actual purchasing power decreased over those seven years, their budgets were not cut.

""You get into a lot of semantic games when you’re talking about [budget] cuts and cuts in real spending power. While [Pawlenty's budget] is not a cut in spending, it is a cut in the level of service available,"" said Stinson.

In fact, in 2009 Pawlenty used stimulus funds to reverse initial budget cuts to K-12 education, and he unexpectedly promised to preserve education when he cut spending in nearly every other area in 2010.

All in all, the research backing Dayton up is solid -- although some might argue with the methodology. For those who believe that failure to keep up with inflation is a budget cut, Dayton's arguments are persuasive. But his allegation that Pawlenty cut education funding is complicated by the fact that actual dollars went up while Pawlenty was in office. We’ll rate this one Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE5CD00>],/factchecks/2010/jul/29/mark-dayton/mark-dayton-says-gov-tim-pawlenty-cut-education-sp/

Tim Pawlenty says the U.S. is not undertaxed compared to its competitors
","
Tim Pawlenty -- Minnesota's outgoing Republican governor and a likely candidate for president in 2012 -- met with Washington reporters on July 26, 2010, for a wide-ranging discussion of politics and policy. One of the things he said made it into the reports of at least two journalists in attendance, Ruth Marcus of the Washington Post and John Dickerson of Slate.. 
Asked what his reaction would be if a presidential commission on the national debt were to recommend a mix of spending cuts and tax increases, Pawlenty said, ""Not good. I don't think the argument can be credibly made that the United States of America is undertaxed compared to our competitors."" 
In an opinion column published the following day, Marcus took aim at Pawlenty's remark. 
""Actually,"" Marcus wrote, ""the United States is on the low end in terms of the overall tax burden -- 28 percent of gross domestic product in 2007, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, compared with an average of 36 percent in the 30 OECD countries. Only South Korea, Mexico and Turkey were lower."" 
By locating the OECD chart -- which is exactly what we would have done -- Marcus ably did much of our work for us. But we still wanted to check with a few tax experts to make sure that she didn't miss anything in her analysis. 
Three experts we queried -- Daniel J. Mitchell, a senior fellow at the libertarian Cato Institute, William Ahern, the director of policy and communications at the Tax Foundation, a tax research group, and Dean Baker, co-director of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research -- all agreed with Marcus's conclusion, though Ahern and Mitchell took the opportunity to add some additional context. 
Ahern said that tax-burden-to-GDP ratios -- the data that underlies the OECD chart -- should be used carefully because they can obscure deficits. A country with a low tax-to-GDP ratio may have a substantial deficit, and in time, that deficit will put upward pressure on taxes. So nations with low tax-to-GDP ratios may not find those ratios sustainable over the long term. 
Mitchell, for his part, agreed with Marcus' point about the overall tax burden, but he noted that in the U.S., the burden from different types of taxes varies. Some types of taxes, such as corporate taxes, are among the highest of the OECD nations. Others are closer to average, such as the top income tax rate and the capital gains tax rate. 
""The big reason the U.S. has a lower aggregate tax burden when measured as a share of GDP is that we don't -- yet -- have a value-added tax,"" Mitchell said. ""Our payroll taxes also tend to be lower than average."" 
Indeed, when we contacted Pawlenty's camp, a spokesman cited the high rates of corporate taxes in the U.S. ""This unacceptably high corporate tax rate makes the U.S. less competitive by encouraging companies to shift investment to nations with lower corporate tax rates,"" said spokesman Alex Conant. 
Despite the caveats from our experts, we see no reason to undercut Marcus' finding that the U.S. ranks low among other developed countries in total tax burden. Corporate taxes are comparatively high in the U.S., and that's a worry for businesses and, indirectly, for their employees and customers. But corporate taxes only accounted for 12 percent of federal tax revenues in 2008, so we don't think it's valid to focus on that factor to the exclusion of the broader tax burden. While we won't take a position on the the question of overtaxation, we think that, contrary to what Pawlenty said, there is a credible argument to be made that the U.S. is undertaxed compared to its competitors. So we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE86040>],/factchecks/2010/jul/29/tim-pawlenty/tim-pawlenty-says-us-not-undertaxed-compared-its-c/

Barack Obama says his budget would lower non-defense spending to JFK levels
","
At a July 22, 2010, ceremony to sign the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act, President Barack Obama took the opportunity to tout his administration's approach to reining in federal spending.

""We’ve drafted a budget for next year that freezes all discretionary government spending outside of national security for three years, a budget, by the way, that would reduce this spending -- non-defense discretionary spending -- to its lowest level as a share of the economy in 50 years,"" Obama said. ""This isn’t talked about a lot, so I’m going to repeat it. Our budget would take non-security defense -- or non-defense spending to its lowest level since JFK -- lowest level as a percentage of the economy since JFK.""

If you look past his verbal false starts, we think there's a fact worth checking here -- that his budget ""would take ... non-defense spending to its lowest level ... as a percentage of the economy since JFK.""

We first turned to the president's own budget blueprint for fiscal year 2011, released in February 2010. Among the document's historical tables is one -- for budget wonks, it's Table 8.4 -- that includes a column for non-defense, discretionary spending as a percentage of GDP all the way back to 1962. This table shows non-defense, discretionary spending at 4.1 percent of GDP for fiscal year 2009 (the most recent completed year), at an estimated 4.7 percent for fiscal year 2010 and an estimated 4.4 percent for fiscal year 2011. From that point, the estimated percentage falls steadily from 3.9 percent in 2012 to 3.3 in 2015.

How does that compare historically? The current numbers are actually high by historical standards; the percentage was lower than 4.1 in every single year between 1984 and 2008, and it was also lower than 4.1 percent in eight additional years going back to 1962. The lowest future projected percentage -- 3.3 in 2015 -- is close to the lowest since 1962, but not quite the lowest.

So the president is close -- but not quite correct -- by these numbers. However, that's not the end of the story.

Experts also pointed us to longer-term projections published in OMB's Mid-Session Review, released July 23, 2010. In Table S-5 (""Proposed Budget by Category as a Percent of GDP""), the line that summarizes ""non-security"" discretionary spending starts at 3.1 percent of GDP for 2009, rises to 3.6 percent for 2010, falls slightly to 3.5 percent for 2011, before declining steadily from 3.0 percent in 2012 to 2.2 in 2019 and 2020.

So by this measurement, it's clear that the Obama Administration does intend to reduce non-security discretionary spending to 3.0 percent of GDP by 2012 and to 2.2 percent by 2019. That's a reduction of its current percentage by one-fifth in the span of two years and about two-fifths in the span of nine years.

We need to point out that this category is called ""non-security"" discretionary spending. That's different than the term ""non-defense"" spending that's used in the President's Budget.

At the risk of getting too far into the weeds, a number of programs count as ""non-defense"" in the President's Budget but as ""security"" in the Mid-Session Review, including the Department of Homeland Security, portions of the Department of Veterans Affairs, the Department of State and other international programs. So while the two statistics are similar -- defense programs account for about 80 percent of the total -- it's enough to distort the percentages in the two reports so that they are not directly comparable.

When we asked the administration for a table that made an apples-to-apples comparison, they sent us one. This chart mirrors the one from the Mid-Session review, going down to 2.2 percent in 2019 and 2020. 3.2 percent recorded in 1999 stands as the record low in this calculation.It also shows the comparable figures in the Kennedy Administration as 2.2 percent in 1962 and 2.4 percent in 1963.

So by these figures, Obama is right. But we should add a caveat -- that the president's budget is a statement of his intentions, not a mandate, and as such should be taken with a grain of salt.

""What will he require Congress to do in 2011?"" asked J.D. Foster, a senior fellow with the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""If they spend more than his budget, will he veto the bills? If they pass 'emergency' measures one after another, will he force them to offset the spending with other spending cuts? If he waves higher spending through every time, his budget becomes nothing more than a propoganda document.""

Indeed, Foster added that non-defense, discretionary spending has historically been in the upper 3 percent range. ""Exactly what cuts is he suggesting to get spending so low?"" he asked. ""Slashing education? Transportation? Health care research? And why does he think Congress would agree to them?""

In fact, the lowest levels of projected non-defense, discretionary spending under the Obama budget would kick in for fiscal year 2019, when he will be long out of office -- even if he wins a second term. But it does fall to lowest-since-JFK levels -- 2.5 percent -- by 2014, which would be during Obama's second term should he win one.

Ultimately, we do think that Obama was careful not to over-sell his point. He said that his budget ""would reduce ... non-defense discretionary spending to its lowest level as a share of the economy in 50 years."" That's more cautious than saying it ""will reduce"" such spending to a record-low level. But we think it's essential to keep in mind that these are the president's intentions -- not firm data. For that reason, we knock it down a notch to Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC971300>],/factchecks/2010/jul/29/barack-obama/barack-obama-says-his-budget-would-lower-non-defen/

ProgressOhio near the mark on spending increases by Ohio auditor candidate Dave Yost
","
David Pepper, the Democratic candidate for state auditor, has consistently characterized his Republican opponent Dave Yost as an out-of-control spender whose budget skyrocketed in his eight years as a county prosecutor.

Pepper says Yost, the Delaware County prosecutor and a Republican with some Tea Party support, increased his office’s spending by 150 percent. The claim also was made by the liberal group ProgressOhio in an online video posted in March.

""In 2009, Yost spent 2.5 times more money than it took to run the office before he got there,"" according to the ProgressOhio video.

The charge is based on a comparison between the Delaware County prosecutor's general fund budgets in 2002, the year before Yost was appointed prosecutor, and 2009. While the prosecutor’s office has access to other funds, such as an account stocked with a portion of the county’s delinquent tax collections, general fund spending is widely regarded as a barometer of an elected official’s fiscal restraint because it is typically used to pay for day-to-day operations.

Pepper, currently a Hamilton County commissioner, has been especially eager to point out Yost’s spending habits because they seem to defy his stance against bloated government spending. The ProgressOhio video shows Yost railing against the increasing cost of government at a 2009 Tea Party event in Columbus.

""I’m concerned about the way we are spending money in the state of Ohio,"" Yost said to the crowd.

The video juxtaposes Yost's speech against shots of budget documents from his office. They are the same documents the county provided us for Yost's general fund budgets. And records show the budget in fact was higher in 2009 than it was in 2002, his predecessor’s last full year in office.

In 2002, the office had a budget of $591,798, according to county records. In 2009, the budget was $1.54 million — 2.6 times the amount budged in 2002.

The county also keeps track of actual spending from the general fund. Spending totaled $577,887 in 2002 and $1.49 million last year. The 2009 figure for actual spending also is about 2.6 times the amount spent in 2002.

But Yost said those documents don’t tell the whole story, and offers these explanations. 
While the ProgressOhio video is correct that the amount of spending in the Delaware County prosecutor’s office jumped during Yost’s tenure, it leaves out the caveat that bookkeeping changes within the county finances helped explain part of those increases. Yost’s argument to mitigate the degree to which his budgets increased is well taken. 
We find ProgressOhio’s statement Mostly True.

Brazile claims income has grown for the top 1 percent; stagnates for the bottom half

Income inequality has become a fairly common Democratic talking point, so we decided to weigh in on the claim that while income for the top 1 percent has been increasing, it's been largely stagnant for the bottom half of the country.

Brazile's office told us to check out a June 2010 report by Arloc Sherman, a senior researcher for the left-learning Center on Budget and and Policy Priorities. Sherman uses data from the Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan number cruncher for Congress, to graph income for different groups over time. The data starts in 1979 and goes through 2007. ""After-tax incomes nearly quadrupled for the top 1 percent of Americans in the last three decades, while barely rising among middle- and lower-income households,"" Sherman writes.

We tracked down the raw CBO figures to see if our own calculations would match Sherman's. The numbers, which come from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Current Population Survey (CPS), show average, inflation-adjusted to 2007, after-tax income. The chart shows how income has changed over time for five different income categories set by the IRS. There is additional data on the top 1 percent. No matter how you slice it, Brazile is on firm ground. Those with incomes in the bottom 20 percent had mean income of $16,100 in 1997. In 2007, it climbed to $17,700 -- or up 9.9 percent. For the group on the next rung up the ladder, income grew by 15.9 percent. For those ranked between 41 and 60 percent of income --only some of whom are in the bottom 50 percent -- income grew from $48,000 in 1997 to $55,300, or about 15.2 percent. That’s not stagnant, but it’s small potatoes compared to a 74.6 percent jump in income for the top 1 percent of earners. Mean income for that group climbed from $755,700 to slightly more than $1.3 million between 1997 and 2007.

We then moved to income data from the U.S. Census. Those inflation-adjusted figures start in 1967 and go through 2008. Looking at the 10  years, 1998 to 2008, mean reported income for those at the bottom fell by 4.2 percent; for the next lowest income group it dropped by 3.9 percent, and for the group that includes some in the lowest half of incomes and some who are not, income decreased by 2.5 percent. During the same period, income for the top 5 percent (the figures do not include information on the top 1 percent), increased by about 0.5 percent. We should note, however, that if we look at income for the top 5 percent between 1998 and 2007 (as opposed to 2008 when the economy began spiraling downward), that's a 1.7 percent increase.

Finally, we contacted numerous independent economic experts, who, for the most part, said that Brazile's argument is accurate. ""The big picture statement is exactly right. No gains for bottom half, big gains for top 1 percent,"" wrote Irwin Garfinkel, professor of contemporary urban problems from Columbia University. Edward Wolff, economics professor at New York University, told us that, based on his calculations from the the Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances, ""income of the bottom half fell by 9 percent over the last 10 years [from 1998-2008] while the income of the top one percent rose by 40 percent.""

A few experts did take issue with Brazile's use of the phrase ""the last 10 years."" As we pointed out, the most recent data for the CBO ends in 2007. Census figures only go through 2008. If Brazile was truly talking about the last 10 years, i.e. from 2000 to 2010, as opposed to the last 10 years for which the data is available, one may argue that she engaged in a little bit of extrapolation. Robert Gordon, an economist at Northwestern University, told us that ""more and more of the compensation of the top 1 percent depends on the stock market,"" which took a plunge during the ongoing recession. Still, Emmanuel Saez, an economics professor at the University of California-Berkeley, argues in a July 2010 paper that the ""Great Recession is unlikely to have a very large impact on top income shares and will certainly not undo much of the dramatic increase in top income shares that has taken place since the 1970s"". Sherman also pointed out that by ""convention, it is often accepted to talk about the last 10 years as meaning the last 10 years for which the data exist.""

We also note that Brazile mentioned ""wages"" in the last part of her statement, which is a narrower term than income. Still, based on our review of the context of the conversation, our discussion with experts, and the statement itself --which mentions income twice, it seems clear that she was talking about income in both cases.

  Donna Brazile said that while the incomes for the top 1 percent have climbed, they've been largely stagnant for the bottom half of the country. We consulted data from the Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. Census, and just to be sure, we double checked with independent economics experts. The CBO numbers showed relatively small increases in income for those in the bottom half, compared with the 74.6 percent gain for the top 1 percent. Mean income for the top 1 percent rose from $755,700 in 1997 to slightly more than $1.3 million 10 years later. The most recent 10-year data -- from Census -- shows income falling for those in the bottom 50 percent and increasing for the top 5 percent. Most of the experts we talked to said Brazile’s underlying argument is on solid ground. As a result, we rate this True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC977BC0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/29/donna-brazile/brazile-claims-income-has-grown-top-1-percent-stag/
"['Drugs', 'Florida', 'Dave Aronberg']","
Dave Aronberg says Broward pain clinics outnumber McDonald's sites
","
The proliferation of pain clinics in Florida has been a growing problem -- particularly in Broward County. Dave Aronberg, a state senator from Palm Beach County running in the Democratic primary for attorney general, has now quantified that problem by comparing it to the availability of Big Macs.

""There are more pain clinics in Broward County than there are McDonald's in Broward County,"" he told the St. Petersburg Times editorial board July 26.

We at PolitiFact Florida wondered, are there really more spots to buy happy meds than Happy Meals in Broward County?

Determining the number of pain clinics was more complicated than counting the number of McDonald's restaurants.

Aronberg campaign spokesman Allison North Jones cited a grand jury investigation led by Broward State Attorney Mike Satz issued in 2009. That report stated that in 2007, there were four pain clinics in Broward. From August 2008 to November 2009, the number swelled from 47 to 115. A footnote in the report states that the statistic comes from the Broward Sheriff's Office Pharmaceutical Drug Diversion Unit.

BSO spokesman Jim Leljedal told us that as of July 28, BSO lists 144 pain clinics in the entire county. But he warned ""sometimes it is hard to have an accurate count because these places come and go, they are thrown out of one storefront and move across the street.""

Aronberg sent us a March 2 blog in the Broward Palm Beach New Times which also looked at his McDonald's comparison -- that time he had made the comment at a St. Petersburg debate.

""After dozens of phone calls and hours of research, it turns out that finding the exact number of pill mills in Broward is impossible,"" The New Times wrote. ""First, it depends on your definition of a 'pill mill.' The pain management clinics in South Florida range from legitimate medical business targeting specific patients suffering chronic pain to junkie-friendly, low-rent operations. Second, a lot of these clinics open and shut down quickly, only to reopen at a new location. Third, and most important, there is little government regulation of the industry, no agency responsible for tracking the businesses.""

The New Times quoted Mike Jachles, a BSO spokesman, as saying there were ""at least 80"" in areas that BSO oversees. The New Times counted 71 McDonald's for Broward County in the phone book.

We also consulted the Florida Department of Health's pain clinic registry. That spreadsheet shows about 343 clinics in Broward, but it lists several with the same addresses multiple times, making it difficult to get an accurate account. We called and e-mailed the health department's communications office in Tallahassee and did not hear back. Two other law enforcement agencies quoted in the past regarding the number of pain clinics -- the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and the Hollywood Police Department -- referred us to the health department.

Next we tried to identify the number of McDonald's restaurants in Broward County. We e-mailed and called McDonald's media relations and after two days of no response, we typed all 31 cities in Broward into the chain's online restaurant locator. We found 73. Aronberg's Senate staff had done the same earlier this year, and found 78. (PolitiFact Florida came up with a different figure than Aronberg's team for Davie, Miramar and Pompano Beach. It's possible that some restaurants have opened and closed since Aronberg's office counted them.) We could not detemine a way to check unincorporated Broward on the McDonald's website. But there is little unincorporated land left so it's unlikely that would change the total significantly, if at all.

So how is Aronberg's math? A grand jury report put the number of pain clinics at 115 by late 2009. The Broward Sheriff's Office puts the number at 144 as of July 28. We found the state health department database too confusing to evaluate, and no one to answer our questions. The best number we could determine for McDonald's locations was 73 -- Aronberg's campaign put it at 78 while the New Times said 71. No matter which number you pick, the number of pain clinics in Broward is dozens higher than the number of McDonald's. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBEFF00>],/factchecks/2010/jul/29/dave-aronberg/aronberg-says-broward-pain-clinics-outnumber-mcdon/

GOP comparison to Pelosi ""inaccurate,"" congressman says
","
It seems like no one wants to be associated with Nancy Pelosi these days.

Many Republican politicians are using Pelosi, the U.S. House speaker, as the boogeywoman this election season. And there's no place better to do that than in Georgia politics.

Mike Keown, a Republican state lawmaker, tried to link the liberal Pelosi to his opponent, incumbent U.S. Rep. Sanford Bishop (D-Ga.), in the Nov. 2 election for Georgia's 2nd Congressional District, which is situated in southwest Georgia and includes Albany and most of Columbus.

Bishop ""wants to distance himself from Nancy Pelosi,"" Keown said in one statement. ""However, that is going to be difficult after his votes on Obamacare, every stimulus and bailout program and increasing the tax debt on every citizen in the 2nd district over $40,000.""

A spokesman for the 18-year congressman from South Georgia fired back in a recent news release.

""Rep. [Mike] Keown's suggestion that Rep. Pelosi's voting record is similar to Congressman Bishop's is inaccurate,"" Bishop spokesman Ashton McRae wrote in an e-mail on Bishop's congressional Web site.

McRae quickly got in trouble for using the Web site to attack Bishop's opponent. McRae posted an apology two days later.

Despite the mea culpa, PolitiFact Georgia wanted to examine the claim the Bishop camp was trying to debunk. Do Bishop and Pelosi vote similarly?

Bishop has fashioned himself as a moderate Democrat. He has breezed through his past three elections, winning about two-thirds of the vote against his Republican challengers, but he is apparently taking no chances. His district does not lean one way. Democrat Barack Obama beat Republican John McCain in the district by about 7,000 votes in the 2008 presidential race. Sonny Perdue, a Republican, defeated Democrat Mark Taylor by more than 5,000 votes in the 2006 race for governor. In the 2004 presidential race, Republican George W. Bush beat Democrat John Kerry by about 20,000 votes.

McRae correctly points out that Pelosi and Bishop have voted differently on some issues, such as allowing gays to openly serve in the military. Pelosi is for it; Bishop is against it.

The Washington Post keeps track of votes by each member of Congress. Bishop voted on more items than Pelosi, so we checked every time they voted on the same issue. PolitiFact Georgia reviewed their records and found that Bishop and Pelosi have voted on the same items 97 times since June 2008. The two voted the same way 92 of those 97 times, according to the Post database. The Post database found Pelosi voted with the majority of Democrats every time during this current Congress. Bishop voted with his colleagues in the Democratic Party 97.7 percent of the time during this Congress, the Post found.

PolitiFact Georgia also checked the Web site of OpenCongress, which detailed information of each bill. We found 61 pieces of legislation (we excluded a comparison of how they voted on congratulating the New Orleans Saints for winning the Super Bowl) that both Bishop and Pelosi voted on. The two representatives voted the same way for 58 of those 61 bills. They differed on legislation such as the redeployment of military contractors in May 2007; the DISCLOSE Act, which would require corporations to name the top five donors in their political ads; and a resolution concerning the limitation of liabilities against doctors and hospitals. The OpenCongress database didn't go back further.

On Tuesday, PolitiFact Georgia contacted McRae, who works in Bishop's congressional office. He referred us to the Bishop campaign for comment. We spoke late Tuesday to Bishop campaign spokesman Tim Turner, who sent PolitiFact Georgia a statement late Wednesday. Turner argued the Post database is filled with ceremonial bills. He pointed us to the National Journal, which compiles an annual rating of each member of Congress based on his or her voting record. The Journal rated Bishop as a ""centrist"" based on his votes in 2009.

Turner argued that focusing on the percentage of times Bishop voted along with his fellow Democrats is misleading.

""It only makes sense that Congressman Bishop would vote with his party to end Republican obstruction,"" he said.

Pelosi and Bishop are not ideological twins, but two separate databases show the two Democrats vote similarly on legislation that came before them. The numbers are pretty similar. We rate the statement from the Bishop camp as False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAE42F00>],/factchecks/2010/jul/29/sanford-bishop/gop-comparison-pelosi-inaccurate-congressman-says/

Jeff Greene ran as a Republican -- 28 years ago
","
Congressman Kendrick Meek attacked his Democratic opponent Jeff Greene in a new political ad set to a disco beat. 
The ad, called ""He's the Man,"" is Meek's first TV attack on Greene in their U.S. Senate race. The narration goes like this: 
""Meet the real Jeff Greene: Ran for Congress as a California Republican. Moved to Florida two years ago. Became a billionaire on Wall Street betting middle-class families would lose their homes. Helped fuel the economic meltdown. Warren Buffet called Greene's scheme 'financial weapons of mass destruction.'"" 
The ad then shows footage of Greene saying, ""They'll attack me for my friends and my past when I was single. Some of it's true, but none of it matters."" 
""Betting on suffering does matter,"" the narrator responds. 
We previously fact-checked similar claims from Meek that Greene was responsible for hurting the economy. We looked at Meek's statement that Greene ""is the king of the undercover Credit Default Swap that brought about the destruction of our economy that we have right now."" We rated that Barely True. We researched Greene's activities thoroughly, and found that Greene did make a lot of money on credit default swaps that paid off when mortgage-backed securities failed. But we also found that Meek was pumping up Greene's role in a complicated economic situation where many different financial players did things to hurt the economy. (Read the full report.) 
We also fact-checked the claim that Greene moved here only two years ago. We rated that True. 
Here, we're checking Meek's claim that Greene ran for Congress as a California Republican. 
The history here dates back to 1982. Greene was 28 years old and living in California. He ran as a Republican for Congress, for a seat representing the Los Angeles area. But he came in second in the primary with 28.2 percent of the vote. The winner was David Armor, who won 43.9 percent. 
The Miami Herald recently tracked down Armor, who was then a 43-year-old social scientist; now he's a professor of public policy at George Mason University in Virginia. Armor won the primary but lost the general election to then-incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson. 
Armor's recollection is that Greene put out a flier attacking him as an ""aging Berkeley radical,"" based on Armor's time as a student activist at University of California at Berkeley. 
""It was a hit piece claiming I was a deceiving the people,'' Armor told the Herald. ""Being in my 40s, I think I was more offended at being called 'aging' than a 'radical.' "" 
Greene doesn't dispute that he ran for Congress as a Republican. ""For a year of my life I was a Republican, and then I quickly got back to what I really believed in,'' he told the Herald in June. 
What's not clear is how long Greene stayed a Republican. PolitiFact Florida examined Greene's voting history last month, contacting voting officials around the country. The Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk told us that Greene registered as a Republican with an address in the city of Los Angeles in 1982. In 1992, he re-registered with an address in Malibu with a party affiliation of ""Decline to State."" If Greene changed his party affiliation shortly after the 1982 run, officials were unable to provide documentation of that. 
Still, the record on Greene's run for Congress as a Republican is undisputed. It was 1982, which was 28 years ago. We rate Meek's statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB74100>],/factchecks/2010/jul/28/kendrick-meek/greene-ran-republican-28-years-ago/

Dan Gelber continues 'junior lawyer' attack against Dave Aronberg
","
Time for another installment of Dan & Dave. No, not the decathletes featured in all those Reebok ads prior to the 1992 Barcelona Summer Olympics.

We're talking about the two Democratic state senators running for attorney general, Dan Gelber and Dave Aronberg.

In this story, Aronberg is accusing Gelber of distorting his legal experience. Gelber, Aronberg says, is distributing a flier that sums up Aronberg's legal experience this way: ""Less than two years as Asst. AG/private attorney.""

""It's one thing to talk about your own experience,"" Aronberg told PolitiFact Florida. ""It's another thing to lie about your opponent's experience.""

Chapter 1: Dave's work history

Aronberg graduated from Harvard Law School in 1996 and went to work for the law firm Steel, Hector and Davis, first in its Miami office, then in West Palm Beach. Aronberg says he worked on corporate litigation at the firm.

After a little over three years, in November 1999, Aronberg began a stint as an assistant attorney general under Bob Butterworth. According to records at the attorney general's office, Aronberg worked in Children's Legal Services until Aug. 17, 2000, when he was selected to be a White House Fellow.

He then spent a year working at the White House as a paid assistant in the Treasury Department. Aronberg told PolitiFact Florida he helped craft the country's anti-money laundering strategy.

After the White House, Aronberg returned to the attorney general's office, this time in the economic crimes division. According to AG records, Aronberg was employed as an assistant attorney general from Sept. 14, 2001, until Jan. 2, 2003, when he was sworn as a state senator. Aronberg did take a leave of absence from July 29, 2002, through Nov. 7, 2002, AG records show. Aronberg said the leave was to campaign for the state Senate.

In May 2003, Aronberg took a job with Greenspoon Marder in its West Palm Beach law office, where he works today.

By our math, that's three years at Steel, Hector and Davis, about two years in two stints at the attorney general's office, and then seven years at Greenspoon Marder -- 12 years of legal experience all together.

Chapter 2: Dan's explanation

When we asked the Gelber campaign for an explanation, they said they weren't questioning our math at all.

Look at how it was worded, they said. Exactly how it was worded.

Ok. Here's the exact style and format of the claim as it appears on the flier:
  
  
""It's two separate things,"" said Gelber campaign manager Christian Ulvert. ""Line one, and line two."" (You can see the flier for yourself by clicking here.)

Ulvert then worked up a detailed explanation of the fact that Aronberg has served less than two years as an assistant attorney general. We'll spare you the details and just say that the attorney general records we got say that Aronberg spent 21 and a half months on the job as an assistant AG.

Chapter 3: Common sense test

But of course that's not the point.

What is, is how you interpret the line in Gelber's flier: ""Less than two years as Asst. AG/private attorney."" Without an explanation, we asked four veteran St. Petersburg Times reporters to look at the flier and interpret the line about Aronberg.

Each reached the same conclusion: That Gelber is saying Aronberg has been an attorney for less than two years.

That's how we read it, too.

We should note that Gelber previously has questioned Aronberg's experience. ""He is a junior lawyer at his best moment,"" Gelber told the St. Petersburg Times' editorial board on July 16, 2010.

Chapter 4: Dan and Dave, the conclusion

Dave Aronberg has been a practicing lawyer for about 12 years. Any suggestion that he's been a lawyer less time is untrue.

Is Gelber making that claim in his flier? Not technically. Gelber says his flier notes that Aronberg's been an assistant attorney general for less than two years (true) and also a private attorney (true).

But we find the wording and format pretty misleading. A less-deceptive way to say it, for instance, would be to reverse the lines: ""private attorney/less than two years as Asst AG."" Or how about: ""Less than two years as assistant attorney general,"" period. 
Despite that clever use of a second line and a slash, we think the typical reader will be misled. We rate Gelber's claim Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBE424C0>],/factchecks/2010/jul/28/dan-gelber/dan-gelber-continues-junior-lawyer-attack-against-/

Rob Portman says Ohio lost 150,000 jobs since Congress passed the federal stimulus bill
","
Rob Portman’s main knock on his Democratic opponent, Lt. Gov. Lee Fisher, is that Ohio has lost hundreds of thousands of jobs during his watch. Portman frequently mocks Fisher as Ohio’s ""Job Czar,"" pointing out the state’s net job losses since Fisher entered office in January 2007. 
As of Monday, July 26, Ohio has lost 386,600 jobs since Fisher, who was the state’s chief development officer until he launched his Senate bid last year, become lieutenant governor.

A former congressman from Cincinnati and a trade ambassador and budget director for Republican President George W. Bush, Portman does not support the federal stimulus package, officially known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The Democratic-led Congress passed the $787 billion bill Feb. 13 and President Barack Obama signed the bill four days later.

To keep his attack fresh, Portman began linking the state’s job losses and the stimulus bill, suggesting that the bill itself is responsible for job losses during the last year and half.

When Vice President Joe Biden attended a fund-raiser on June 30 in Cleveland with Fisher, Portman’s campaign issued this statement, which inflated the cost of the stimulus package by $213 billion: Biden’s ""trip to Ohio would be a perfect opportunity for Lt. Gov. Fisher to admit that the Democrats' trillion-dollar stimulus isn't working and hasn't created the jobs in Ohio."" The campaign release went on to say Ohio has lost 150,000 jobs since the stimulus bill passed.

Portman’s campaign also used the 150,000-jobs-lost figure in a statement June 18, the day Obama visited Columbus to tout a road project funded with stimulus money.

We wondered if that number was right, so we checked the official totals kept by the state.

We found some problems with Portman’s claim and the campaign’s efforts to back it up: 
Portman’s campaign later offered The Plain Dealer conflicting citations for the figures in both statements, and for the time-frame examined, making it difficult to pin down how and when they computed the figure.

In the end, the number of jobs lost cited in Portman’s June 30 statement is inflated and not close enough to be considered a difference that can be attributed to rounding. Furthermore, while the campaign is correct that jobs have been lost since the stimulus was passed, its release ignores important context: Ohio has started to see net job gains in recent months, albeit small, contradicting a suggestion that the stimulus bill is causing job losses.

So, for these reasons, we rate Portman's claim Half True.

On ""Meet the Press"", David Gregory says financial sector equals 25 percent of U.S. economy
","On July 25, 2010, David Gregory, the host of NBC's Meet the Press, asked Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner if the relative size of the financial sector in the United States bothered him.

""As someone's who concerned about the overall growth of the economy, the role of education, innovation, manufacturing, does it trouble you that 25 percent of our economy is the financial sector, which doesn't actually make anything besides money?"" Gregory asked.

Geithner largely sidestepped the question, saying, ""I don't know ... how large the system's going to be in the future. You can't really tell."" But we were actually more interested in the statistic underlying Gregory's question. Is he right that the financial sector accounts for a full one-fourth of the American economy?

To find the answer, we looked at several statistical tables from the U.S. Commerce Department's Bureau of Economic Analysis. Here's what they show:

• Gross output by industry. For the most recent year available, 2008, the category ""finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing"" accounted for $4.846 trillion in gross output, compared to $26.574 trillion for the entire economy. That's 18 percent. If you calculate it as a share of the private economy alone, which was $23.467 trillion that year, then it accounted for a little under 21 percent.

Neither calculation reaches the 25 percent Gregory specified -- but the best estimation for the ""financial sector"" may be even lower.

We asked economists whether they thought that ""finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing"" was really the right category to be using, and they agreed it was too broad. ""However you look at it, including real estate, rental, or leasing would be wrong,"" said J.D. Foster, a senior fellow at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""At the core of Gregory's premise is that people are making money off of money. Real estate, rental, and leasing all involve tangible property of some sort.""

Fortunately, the statistics break out ""finance and insurance"" as a separate total. This category generated $2.169 trillion in gross output in 2008, which equals about 8 percent of the whole economy and 9 percent of the private economy. So by this measure, the actual percentage is far below what Gregory said.

• Value added by industry. For 2009, ""finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing"" accounted for $3.058 trillion in value added, compared to $14.256 trillion for the whole economy. That's 21 percent. If you calculate it as a share of the private economy alone, which was $12.324 trillion that year, then it accounted for 25 percent -- the first number we've calculated that matches Gregory's percentage.

If you use the narrower ""finance and insurance"" figure instead, you'll find that this category generated $1.198 trillion in value added in 2009, which equals about 8 percent of the entire economy and almost 10 percent of the private economy. Once again, the narrower category falls far short of Gregory's estimate.

• Compensation of employees by industry. For 2008, ""finance, insurance, real estate, rental, and leasing"" accounted for about $718 billion in employee compensation, compared to $8.037 trillion for the whole economy. That's 9 percent. If you calculate it with private compensation alone, which was $6.474 trillion, it works out to 11 percent. Both are well below Gregory's estimate.

Once again, using the narrower ""finance and insurance"" figure instead, you'll find that this category generated about $608 billion in employee compensation in 2008, which equals less than 8 percent of the whole economy and a bit more than 9 percent of the private-sector economy.

Gary Burtless, an economist with the liberal-to-centrist Brookings Institution, suggests that Gregory may have been thinking about financial-sector corporate profits as a share of all corporate profits, which requires a different calculation.

In 2009, the financial sector -- which does not appear to include real estate in this case -- recorded $331.2 billion in profits. Compared to the $1.309 trillion in total adjusted corporate profits, that's almost exactly the 25 percent figure Gregory mentioned. (We e-mailed Gregory but didn't receive a response by publication time.)

Burtless agreed that if Gregory meant to cite the profits figure, then he misspoke. But Burtless added that the corporate profits number is notable for being high -- and rising in recent years.

""The percentage is dramatically higher than was the case back when the U.S. economy was delivering much better income growth for Americans in the middle and at the bottom of the income distribution,"" Burtless said. ""The years 1950 to 1973 were pretty good years for middle-income families, and back in that era, financial companies earned an average of 13 percent of all corporate profits. If Gregory was trying to suggest there may be something wrong with an economy in which 25 percent of corporate profits are earned by bankers, brokers, hedge fund managers, insurance companies, and the like, there may be something to that argument.""

A final note. While we aren't directly rating Gregory's claim that the ""financial sector ... doesn't actually make anything besides money,"" we thought it would be worth relaying a strong objection to Gregory's characterization by Foster of Heritage.

""You don't have to love Wall Street or the big banks to acknowledge the vital role of financial markets in helping those who do make things do so more efficiently and at lower cost, and in helping the nation use its financial capital to greatest advantage,"" he said. ""If the financial industry 'doesn't make anything,' what exactly does the news business make? Of course, they both provide important services, and you know those services are important because people are willing to pay for them.""

Now let's get back to the specific statement we're rating -- that ""25 percent of our economy is the financial sector."" We calculated the numbers 12 different ways, and only one reached Gregory's 25 percent threshold. Reaching that level requires including ""real estate, rental and leasing"" in the equation (which our experts said is not the best way to calculate it) and dividing by the private economy only (a distinction Gregory did not make).

No, Mike Pence never said people need 'Jesus care' more than health care
","The internet has a way of twisting people’s words — or making them up altogether. Vice President Mike Pence is known for his religious beliefs, and currently a fake quote attributed to him is circulating on the internet, suggesting that he once said people with pre-existing conditions need ""Jesus care"" more than health care. Here is the supposed quote, in full: ""What the American people need is not more health care. What we need is more Jesus care. I believe if we can just get more of the people with pre-existing health conditions back into churches, you would see a lot of healing and many of these problems would go away.

The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The quote is fabricated. There is no record of Pence ever saying those words. It first appeared online in May 2017 following House Republicans' approval of the American Health Care Act, a measure to partially repeal Obamacare. It later failed in the Senate. This time around, the quote was posted Feb. 14 on a Facebook page called ""Why Republicans Suck."" In less than 24 hours it racked up nearly 200 shares.

"['State Budget', 'Illinois', 'Susana Mendoza']","
The trouble with Mendoza’s attempt to pin Illinois’ budget crisis on Daley
","In her bid for Chicago mayor, Illinois Comptroller Susana Mendoza is quick to highlight the battles she waged against former Gov. Bruce Rauner during the state’s historic budget impasse. Now, she’s out with an interactive ad attacking rival Bill Daley for not taking a similar stand during the two years when Illinois operated without a budget after he served on the Republican governor’s transition team following the 2014 election. The ad, a website in the style of the game show Jeopardy, invites viewers to play ""The Daley Trouble"" and ""learn more about Bill’s background."" The answer to all the categories is, of course, ""Who is Bill Daley?"" One of them, titled ""Rauner Budget Crisis,"" offers a description that invited deeper scrutiny. ""After co-chairing Bruce Rauner’s transition team and writing the blueprint for the governor’s four years of crisis and destruction, he stood by and remained silent,"" it reads, simultaneously chiding Daley for failing to protest Rauner’s actions in office and accusing him of charting the course for the now departed Republican. That head-spinning logic aside, Mendoza’s claim made us wonder what recommendations Daley and other co-chairs of Rauner’s transition team had made in their report. There’s no need to relitigate the budget crisis here. As we’ve pointed out in previous fact-checks, both Rauner and Democrats share responsibility for bringing it about. But we were curious whether the transition report itself could be considered a ""blueprint"" for the policies Rauner pushed during those tumultuous years. The short answer is no. Mendoza’s ad links Daley, son of one former Chicago mayor and brother of another, to Rauner, who was defeated after one term by now Gov. J.B. Pritzker. In another Jeopardy-style tile, she also highlights a $1 million dollar donation Daley recently received from hedge fund billionaire Ken Griffin, a big financial backer of not just Rauner but also outgoing Mayor Rahm Emanuel. The Griffin connection provides a foil for Mendoza’s own well-documented confrontations with Rauner over how the state pays its bills, around which she nurtured a statewide reputation as a savvy administrator of the state’s finances who could work across the aisle in Springfield to get things done. But her claim that Daley somehow paved the way for the role Rauner played in the state’s protracted budget impasse lacks substance. For one thing, Daley did not single-handedly draft the transition team’s report, as Mendoza’s ad suggests. Instead, he was among a bipartisan group of 28 co-chairs who signed off on the document after consulting with business and community leaders across the state. Fellow Chicago mayoral candidate Willie Wilson was also a co-chair, along with former Gov. Jim Edgar, a Republican who more recently served on Democrat Pritzker’s transition team. What’s more, there is no evidence the contents of the report guided Rauner’s decision to engage in a two-year squabble with the Democrat-controlled General Assembly that stymied the state’s ability to pay its vendors on time and jeopardized funding for everything from social services to higher education. A news article published just before Rauner was sworn into office described his transition team’s report as little more than a reproduction of the Republican’s ""largely generic campaign themes."" Indeed, the report itself notes the team was ""not in a position to provide specific recommendations on budgetary solutions."" Transition reports like Rauner’s typically lack specifics, rendering Daley’s role in the process largely ceremonial. ""You read into it what you want to read into it if the details aren’t there,"" said Charles N. Wheeler III, who directs the Public Affairs Reporting program at the University of Illinois-Springfield and covered state politics for decades. We asked Mendoza’s campaign to show us where the report proposed controversial policies Rauner later sought to implement in a way that contributed to gridlock. A spokeswoman pointed us to several passages that highlighted the need to improve the state’s business climate under the new administration, only one of which proposed the governor take any form of concrete action. That passage urged Rauner to look into lowering workers’ compensation rates, but the only specifics mentioned were suggestions he review existing legislation to ensure Illinois aligned with similar states and appoint ""highly capable workers’ compensation commissioners and arbitrators."" Rauner did push for major changes to the state’s workers’ compensation system after he took office, but little of what he sought — and did not get from a Democratic legislature — was telegraphed in the transition report tied to Daley. Among the controversial pieces of what Rauner called his Turnaround Agenda that were not included in the report: freezing property taxes, imposing term limits on lawmakers, capping the prevailing wage and establishing local ""right-to-work"" zones. Even the vague mention in the report of reducing workers’ compensation rates wasn’t an automatic non-starter with legislative Democrats, who in 2011 approved a bill aimed at reducing those costs. What Democrats later took issue with was Rauner’s demand for sweeping change before giving that measure a chance to work. Asked to explain how Mendoza was connecting the dots between the report’s loosely-defined priorities and Rauner’s later decisions as the state’s chief executive, her spokeswoman sent us a response that essentially repeated the ad’s original claim. Susana Mendoza’s ad says that as part of the governor’s transition team, Bill Daley wrote ""the blueprint"" for what she calls Rauner’s ""four years of crisis and destruction."" Daley helped produce a report that outlined general priorities for Rauner’s incoming administration on a long list of issues. But there is no evidence that document, which was heavy on generalities but extremely light on concrete policy recommendations, guided Rauner’s later actions that contributed to two years of gridlock with the Democrat-controlled General Assembly over how to govern the state. Mendoza's claim that Daley laid the framework for Rauner’s role in the state’s protracted budget impasse boils down to a broad accusation of guilt by association. We rate it False.

"['Abortion', 'Vermont', 'Christopher Coyne']","
Would a proposed Vermont law allow abortions ‘right up to the moment of birth’?
","Vermont’s Catholic Church has jumped into an emotional debate over a new bill that would codify abortion rights in the state’s law. Vermont has joined a number of states in reconsidering its abortion laws since the appointment of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court, creating a conservative majority that abortion rights advocates fear imperils the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. Christopher Coyne, bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, did not join a public hearing on H.57, a bill that supporters say codifies existing abortion access into law, saying that his moral authority in the Statehouse has been undermined by priest abuse scandals. But the bishop made clear that he is adamantly opposed to the law, speaking to parishioners during a public meeting on Feb. 6. ""We’re talking about a law that would allow a child to be aborted right up to the moment of birth,"" Coyne said of the proposed bill during that meeting. ""It’s taking us to a place where we’re literally killing babies."" While Vermont’s Republican governor says he supports a woman’s right to choose, he has declined to weigh in on the bill as conservative opposition has mounted. Abortion rights advocates say the law simply puts existing practice into law. Those who oppose abortion say the legislation will allow mothers and physicians to end a pregnancy at any point until birth. Could both sides be right? We decided to check the facts. Asked about his position on the law, Coyne pointed to section 9497, which prohibits public entities from restricting abortion access. ""This section prohibits (makes illegal) any restrictions placed upon a woman's right to have an abortion. No such restrictions are named in the bill, but would include any restrictions involving gestational age of the unborn child,"" he wrote in an email. ""The bill, therefore, codifies a woman's right to have an abortion at any time during a pregnancy, for any or no reason, up until full-term birth,"" he added. That’s true, if medical professionals did not adhere to their own policies and ethical practices. But it’s not a change from the current legal restrictions -- or complete lack thereof -- on abortion in Vermont. Brynn Hare, the legislative counsel working on the abortion bill, sent out a memo on Jan. 27 describing Vermont’s existing laws around abortion, and how the proposed law would impact current access and practices. ""In Vermont, there is an unrestricted legal right to get an abortion regardless of age or marital status,"" she wrote. ""There is no requirement that a person notify or get permission from a parent, guardian, or spouse prior to getting an abortion."" The Vermont Medical Society testified before the House Human Services Committee on H.57 earlier this month. ""Vermont law currently is silent on abortion and allows abortion with no restriction,"" it said. However, in 2016, the latest year for which abortion data is available, ""91.7 percent of all Vermont abortions happened within the first trimester (12 weeks or less) and only 1.3 percent of Vermont abortions occurred in 2016 after 21 weeks."" Data from the Centers for Disease Control on abortions nationwide in 2015 shows that seven abortions were conducted in Vermont after 21 weeks -- 0.7 percent of all abortions in the state -- but doesn’t give a more specific breakdown for when those procedures were performed. The medical society added that woman simply do not elect to terminate pregnancies in the final few months, as opponents of H.57, like Coyne, suggest. ""‘Late term’ abortion is a social construct introduced to create an image of an elective abortion that happens closer to 8-9 months, which does not happen and is not a term that is used medically,"" the society says. And even if a woman wanted to abort a pregnancy that late, there are no providers who would do it in Vermont, according to the medical society. ""No abortion providers in Vermont perform elective abortions in the third trimester,"" it says. Lucy Leriche, the vice president of public policy at Planned Parenthood of Northern New England, said the only time when a woman might get an abortion that late in their pregnancy would be ""under really severe circumstances for health of mother or because the viability of pregnancy is at risk."" Doctors who do carry out elective procedures that late in pregnancy, she added, would face dire professional consequences for violating their licensure and committing medical malpractice. So abortions in the third trimester are exceedingly rare, and don’t occur as elective procedures, but are they legal, as Coyne says? Because Vermont has no legal abortion restrictions whatsoever, that’s currently a question about federal laws and Supreme Court decisions, and how they apply in Vermont. Hare, the legislative counsel, explores this in her memo to legislators. Roe v. Wade did two major things, she writes, it says that states cannot regulate abortion in the first trimester and that states can regulate abortion later in the pregnancy. The Supreme Court has since struck down state laws restricting abortion if they are found to place an ""undue burden"" on woman seeking abortions. The Federal Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act, which was passed in 2003, prohibits providers from performing a procedure that it describes as ""An abortion in which the person performing the abortion, deliberately and intentionally vaginally delivers a living fetus until, in the case of a head-first presentation, the entire fetal head is outside the body of the mother, or, in the case of breech presentation, any part of the fetal trunk past the navel is outside the body of the mother."" The law currently before Vermont lawmakers would not legalize such procedures. Hare writes: ""In the event that a provider in Vermont knowingly performed a ‘partial-birth abortion’ as it is defined by the Act in violation of that federal statute, the provider could be prosecuted as provided for in the Act, and regardless of the provisions in H.57."" But as Coyne has pointed out, ""partial-birth abortion"" does not describe all late-term abortions, and no one disputes that abortions for medical emergencies are legal throughout the pregnancy.   The Catholic Church, which is opposed to all abortions, has weighed into recent debates in other states. A couple weeks ago Politifact interrogated a viral image claiming that ""A New York law makes it ‘now perfectly legal to murder’ a baby a minute before it would be born."" Catholic leaders in New York had said the law removed ""all state restrictions on late-term procedures."" The viral image got a ""False"" rating from Politifact because it ""oversimplifies and distorts what the New York law allows."" The New York law includes language that allows abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy only if ""there is an absence of fetal viability, or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient’s life or health."" Vermont’s law has no such language. Bishop Coyne’s statement is true in a strict legal sense, but only if the law existed in a practice and policy vacuum. Without context, it is seriously misleading in regards to what would be permissible practice in Vermont. The proposed law would not change the legal reality in Vermont in any way. And all evidence indicates that the type of abortions that the bishop fears -- elective procedures in the final stages of pregnancy -- do not occur in Vermont, and would not occur if H.57 passes. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC626900>],/factchecks/2019/feb/16/christopher-coyne/would-proposed-vermont-law-allow-abortions-right-m/
"['Elections', 'Redistricting', 'North Carolina', 'Chuck McGrady']","
NC Republican half-right about GOP support for redistricting reform
","There’s more support for redistricting reform than meets the eye, according to one North Carolina legislator. For decades, North Carolina’s election maps have been criticized as biased toward whichever party controlled the legislature when the maps were drawn. And currently, the state faces four different legal challenges to its maps. So Rep. Chuck McGrady, a Republican from Henderson County, hopes the legislature will change its ways before the maps need to be redrawn in 2021. On Feb. 13, McGrady introduced a bill that would shift redistricting responsibilities from the legislature to a committee of non-politicians. Given GOP legislators have controlled the state House and state Senate since 2011, it may seem like Republicans aren’t interested in redistricting reform. But that’s not so, McGrady claims. ""In my caucus, nearly half of the Republicans now serving have voted for this type of bill … or have cosponsored one or more of the nonpartisan redistricting bills,"" McGrady said Wednesday during a press conference. There are currently 65 Republicans in the House. For McGrady’s claim to be correct, about 33 of them need to have previously supported a redistricting bill. How close does McGrady come? If we’re talking about House Republicans who supported bills before 2019, McGrady comes up a little short – something he realized when contacted by PolitiFact. McGrady said he got his information from Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause NC, a left-leaning voting rights advocacy group. McGrady miscounted the number of legislators who previously supported nonpartisan redistricting, he said in an email. ""I didn’t realize I was double counting some members since they were included both as voting for a bill and cosponsoring one or more bills,"" McGrady said, referring to a list he was given. It’s also important to note that Republicans who previously supported a nonpartisan redistricting bill aren’t necessarily going to support it this year. Still, McGrady’s not that far off. His prediction comes close, but only because of Republicans who support his bill this year. Let’s walk down memory lane. A 2011 BILL Among the bills McGrady mentioned in his press conference was House Bill 824, a bill introduced in 2011 that would’ve created a nonpartisan redistricting process. Five current House members were among the bill sponsors: Ten more voted for the bill at least once: That makes 15 Republican legislators who voted on HB 824. A 2013 BILL In 2013, a bipartisan group of legislators filed another nonpartisan redistricting bill. The bill, HB 606, was never put up for a vote. But several Republican supporters of the 2011 bill sponsored HB 606, as well as these six other Republicans: So far, that puts our count of nonpartisan redistricting supporters at 21 Republicans. BILLS IN 2015, 2017 In 2015, HB 92 sought to form a nonpartisan redistricting commission. It was never voted on, but several current Republicans supported it, including John Fraley of Iredell County and Lee Zachary of Yadkin. A similar bill, HB 200, was introduced in 2017 and never voted on. Cody Henson of Transylvania County was among a handful of Republican sponsors. By our count, 24 Republican House members supported nonpartisan redistricting bills before this year. That brings us to 2019 and the bill McGrady just introduced, HB 69. It’s sponsored by eight Republicans who weren’t already on our list: (Goodwin, Hanig, Ross and Sasser added their names to the bill after McGrady’s press conference.) That means, as of 3 p.m. Friday afternoon, 32 House Republicans have cosponsored or voted for a nonpartisan redistricting bill at some point. Additionally, Republican Reps. Greg Murphy of Pitt County and Keith Kidwell of Beaufort signed a pledge with Common Cause NC, to support an independent, nonpartisan redistricting commission. OUR RULING McGrady said ""nearly half"" of House Republicans have supported a nonpartisan redistricting bill. Only 24 House Republicans (about 37 percent) supported a nonpartisan redistricting bill before 2019, which isn’t close to half of the 65 GOP House members. But, when you consider Republican support for his new bill, he’s pretty much right that nearly half of House Republicans have supported the idea of nonpartisan redistricting at some point. We rate this claim Half True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Yes, Trump re-election banners are being made in China, but it doesn't appear his campaign is paying
","Donald Trump has long touted an ""America First"" theme in his campaign and presidency, vowing to bring jobs back to the United States and not be beholden to other countries, China in particular. So when an image claiming to show Chinese factory workers making one of apparently thousands of Trump 2020 campaign banners hits the interne, people took notice. The photo appears to depict a Chinese worker with a banner that reads ""Trump 2020. Keep America Great!"" Text near the bottom of the photo says: ""Here’s a Chinese factory worker making one of the 90,000 banners for Trump’s 2020 campaign. The banners say ‘Keep America Great.’ I guess #45 thinks keeping America great means hiring Chinese workers instead of American workers. So much for ‘America First.’"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) This isn’t the first time critics have called out Trump for having products made outside the United States. But is it true that some of his 2020 re-election campaign banners are being made in China? It does appear, according to multiple news accounts, that items for Trump’s 2020 run are being manufactured in China (or at least they were prior to the implementation of the announced U.S. tariffs on Chinese products). But it is not proven that any of the materials were actually ordered by Trump’s re-election campaign. It is a charge the campaign denies, and campaign finance records back that up. Let’s take a look. The photo used in the post is authentic, and comes from a July 25, 2018, Reuters story that reported 2020 Trump re-election materials were being made in a factory in eastern China. On July 16, the Agence France Presse also reported that the factory was making the items. Other American outlets quickly picked up the Reuters story. Shortly after the story came out, Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., cited the report in a Facebook post, writing, ""Given the choice between hiring American workers at a living wage or hiring much less expensive workers from China that he can exploit, Trump opts for the low-cost overseas labor day in and day out."" The factory, Jiahao Flag Co Ltd in the Anhui province, had churned out about 90,000 banners since March 2018, manager Yao Yuanyuan told Reuters. The outlet reported that it was an ""unusually large number for what is normally the low season, and Yao believed the China-U.S. trade war was the reason."" Yuanyuan also told Reuters that the factory has been making Trump banners for as long as his campaign slogan has been ""Make America Great Again,"" saying that ""sales have been great ever since 2015."" But even Yuanyuan said that while the buyers were located in China and abroad, she didn’t know if they were affiliated with Trump’s official campaign or the Republican Party. When we reached out to Trump’s campaign, they told us the flags are counterfeit. ""All merchandise made by the Trump campaign are made in the USA,"" campaign manager Brad Parscale wrote in an email. ""There are thousands of counterfeit items made by scammers. These flags are counterfeit."" On the campaign’s website, there aren’t any ""2020 Keep America Great"" banners for sale, but flags similar to the ones in the picture do appear on Amazon from different sellers. And a comparison between the factory’s signs and Trump’s official 2016 signage shows slight differences in color and formatting. We also reviewed the campaign’s expenditures for the 2017-18 cycle and could not find any payments made to a Chinese entity for re-election materials such as hats, flags and banners. The two companies the campaign seems to have used the most in that area are Ace Specialties, based out of Louisiana, and Cali-Fame out of California (maker of the red MAGA hats). A Facebook post shows a picture of a Chinese factory worker making ""one of the 90,000"" Trump 2020 re-election banners and accuses the ""America First"" president of hiring Chinese workers over American workers. The photograph is authentic. There have been at least 90,000 Trump 2020 re-election materials produced in China, and at a rapid rate as U.S. tariffs loom over the country. While pictures and interviews show the items are indeed being made in a Chinese factory, there is not enough information to link it to Trump’s campaign. Moreover, not only did the Trump campaign deny they ordered the items and called the flags counterfeit, FEC data for the campaign’s expenditures does not include any Chinese companies. The statement has an element of truth — there are thousands of Trump re-election items being made in China – but, based on what we know now, claiming that the president is behind the production without proof falls short.

Beto O'Rourke says US has 'no clue' when visa holders leave through land ports. Is it true?
","Beto O’Rourke rejected President Donald Trump’s demand for a border wall with Mexico. Instead, O’Rourke promoted other policy goals that he said would make America stronger and safer. O’Rourke, a former House Democrat from Texas, targeted visa overstays as a better starting point in a Feb. 8 Medium blog post. He called for tracking visa holders and ""fully harmonizing our entry-exit systems with Mexico and Canada."" ""When a visa holder exits the U.S. and enters Mexico, we will then know that they have left the U.S.,"" O’Rourke wrote. ""Currently, if they leave through a land port of entry we literally have no clue if they are still here or have returned to their country of origin."" Is it really true that the U.S. government has ""no clue"" when visa holders leave the United States and enter Mexico on foot or by vehicle? The key here is land crossings, and on that, O'Rourke has a point.  Customs and Border Protection officers don’t systematically collect data on every single person crossing via land between the United States and Mexico. Some pilot programs and initiatives inform the U.S. government about people leaving the country, but those measures are not enforced at every land port. Commercial air and sea carriers are required by federal law to provide U.S. government officials passenger data, such as name and passport number. Customs and Border Protection matches data of departing travelers against arrival data to determine if they complied with their terms of admission or overstayed the length of a visa. But it’s challenging to get advance information from land travelers, because most leave in private vehicles or simply walk, said a Department of Homeland Security fiscal year 2017 report. (The report was released in August 2018 and focused on foreigners’ air and sea travels.) Physical, logistical and operational obstacles limit the collection of data from people who leave the United States by land, particularly at the southwest border. Generally, land travel involves cars, trains, buses, bicycles, trucks and pedestrians. ""The process of recording the departure of outbound travelers is still in development,"" reads a separate DHS report from December 2017 sent to us by O’Rourke’s spokesman. Records of departures through the southern border are limited. In December 2017, Customs and Border Protection announced the launch of a pilot program between the agency and Mexico’s National Institute of Migration. The goal is to collect and share biographic information of pedestrians who leave the United States and enter Mexico. It’s specific to Mexican nationals with Radio Frequency Identification (RFID)-enabled travel documents and who are crossing through California’s San Ysidro immigration port. Customs and Border Protection said it planned to eventually apply the program to all travelers. ""Beto's post calls for fully harmonizing our entry-exit systems,"" said O’Rourke spokesman Chris Evans. ""A pilot program that only applies to some travelers going through one port of entry out of 47 along a more than 1,900-mile border is not full harmonization and does not appropriately share information of those who leave the U.S. through all of our land ports of entry."" Specific to vehicle departures in fiscal year 2017, the department recorded the fingerprints of some people leaving the United States through three southern border ports. Border enforcement officials were not using this technique regularly; it was used for intelligence-based operations or at random. Customs and Border Protection planned to expand that use of fingerprinting devices at land borders nationwide in fiscal year 2018, the DHS report said. The United States has more information on departures at the northern border. DHS said 98.6 percent of entry information it gets from Canada matches data in the U.S. database for arrivals and departures. At official ports of entry, Canadian officials check documents systematically, said David FitzGerald, a sociology professor and co-director at the Center for Comparative Immigration Studies at the University of California-San Diego. ""On the southern border, there has historically been no exit control on the U.S. side, and no systematic entrance control on the Mexican side of border towns either,"" FitzGerald said. O’Rourke said that when visa holders exit the United States and enter Mexico, ""if they leave through a land port of entry we literally have no clue if they are still here or have returned to their country of origin."" Customs and Border Protection has launched pilot programs and initiatives to find out who is leaving the country. But those efforts have been limited in scope and locations. Immigration officials acknowledge that it is difficult to track departures, which supports O’Rourke’s broader point about better addressing visa overstays and ""harmonizing"" entry and exit systems at land ports. O’Rourke’s claim is accurate but needs clarification.

Too early to say Gov. Evers flipped on raising minimum wage
","The 2018 gubernatorial campaign featured plenty of spirited debate between Republican Gov. Scott Walker and Democratic challenger Tony Evers. Among the flash points: The state’s minimum wage. Evers, who defeated Walker, backed raising the state minimum wage from $7.25 an hour to $15 an hour, though with a lower minimum for teenagers and workers in rural areas. Indeed, his position was spelled out on his website: ""Tony supports raising the minimum wage to $15/hour and indexing to inflation. However, like Senator Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, Tony also believes that this should be phased in over multiple years."" Has Evers already backed off such a central promise weeks into his term? That was the claim made Jan. 8, 2019 by the Republican Party of Wisconsin, which cited an article by the Maclver Institute headlined: ""Evers has pulled an about-face on several campaign promises."" Seems like a good time to return to our Flip-O-Meter, which we use to gauge whether a politician has changed his or her position. Our requisite reminder: We are not rating whether any change is good (or bad) politics or policy -- just whether the politician has been consistent. We have already used the Flip-O-Meter to look at whether Evers has shifted his position on directing the attorney general to withdraw Wisconsin from the pre-existing conditions lawsuit (Rating: Full Flop) and on dissolving the Wisconsin Economic Development Corp. in his first budget (Rating: Full Flop). What about Evers and his support for a $15 minimum wage? Has his position changed? The evidence In the article, the MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank based in Madison, cited two Evers statements to declare he had flip-flopped on the minimum wage. The MacIver article quoted a statement from an October 2018 rally featuring Sanders at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, in which Evers said: ""We’re going to $15 an hour minimum."" That’s pretty clear. And consistent with his campaign platform. As evidence Evers has backed off the $15 promise, the article cites an interview he did with the Wisconsin State Journal posted Jan. 3, 2019. The lead of the State Journal article states: ""Democratic Gov.-elect Tony Evers says he expects his first state budget plan to offer a ‘clear pathway’ to increase the state’s $7.25 minimum wage."" From lower in the article: Evers declined to say how, or how much, his budget would propose to increase the state’s minimum wage, which now is as low as permitted under federal law: $7.25 an hour. He said only ""there will be a clear pathway found in the budget to get to"" an increase.

During the campaign Evers supported a gradual increase to a $15 minimum wage. He told the State Journal editorial board in October that he’s open to exceptions to a $15 wage in rural areas and for teenage workers.

Such a plan likely would meet with opposition from the Republican-controlled Legislature, which has resisted minimum-wage hikes embraced in neighboring states.

Of the states bordering Wisconsin, only Iowa has a $7.25 minimum wage. Illinois’ minimum is $8.25 an hour, Michigan’s is $9.25 and Minnesota’s is $9.65 for large employers and $7.87 for small ones, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. To critics, this is evidence of a shift in position. The MacIver article notes ""While his first budget will offer a ‘clear pathway’ to raising the wage, Evers declined to say how, or how much, his budget would propose to increase the state’s minimum wage."" In our view, this is not a switch at all. Evers’ platform talked about the need to phase in an increase -- it did not call for an immediate jump to the $15 level. And, in any case, the budget at hand covers a two-year period, or roughly the first half of his term. It’s not Evers’ only shot to accomplish his goal. Indeed, when we contacted Britt Cudaback, Evers’ deputy communications director, she said the governor has not backed off his pledge. ""The Governor indicated he thinks we can get to $15 by the end of his first term,"" Cudaback said in an email. ""The article isn’t reporting that the Governor won’t be trying to raise the wage or that the Governor no longer supports a $15 minimum wage, just that the Governor declined to say exactly ‘how, or how much’ it would be increased in his budget, which he’ll be introducing on February 28."" Our rating The state Republican Party and the MacIver Institute have accused Evers of shifting his position on raising the state’s minimum wage. Has he? The evidence is beyond slim. Evers has long talked of phasing in an increase. Not telegraphing how much he might move to increase it in his first budget is not evidence that he no longer wants to increase it at all. We rate this one a No Flip.  ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC97E880>],/factchecks/2019/feb/14/tony-evers/too-early-say-gov-evers-flipped-raising-minimum-wa/

TRUE: ‘More than a million Californians’ don’t have clean drinking water … It could be higher
"," Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom has made confronting California’s contaminated drinking water a top priority early in his term in office. In his first week, he took his cabinet on a road trip to meet with Central Valley residents who, for years, have had to rely on bottled water for drinking and cooking. In his budget, he called for a tax on drinking water to help disadvantaged communities clean up contaminated water. Then he signed one of his first pieces of legislation to provide assistance to communities with unsafe water, including $10 million for emergency drinking water projects. During his State of the State Address, Newsom called California’s safe drinking water crisis ""a moral disgrace and a medical emergency."" He added this assertion: ""Just this morning, more than a million Californians woke up without clean water to bathe in or drink."" Is the problem this widespread? We decided to fact-check Newsom’s claim. Our research Clean drinking water advocates and researchers told us Newsom’s statement is correct, but noted it’s an estimate based on incomplete data, and that the actual number could be higher. ""It’s worse,"" said Jonathan London, a UC Davis professor who’s written about contaminated drinking water. The professor said one million would be ""an underestimate."" In the San Joaquin Valley alone, there were nearly 100,000 residents living without access to clean drinking water, according to a February 2018 UC Davis study London co-authored. ""Unfortunately, (Newsom’s) number is true,’ added Kelsey Hinton, spokesperson for the Community Water Center, a San Joaquin Valley nonprofit that advocates for clean drinking water. As evidence, both London and Hinton pointed to a 2017 drinking water compliance report by the State Water Resources Control Board, which regulates water quality. The report shows that an estimated 592,000 Californians lived in a public water district that received a water quality violation in 2017. But that doesn’t include people living in private, unregulated districts. London said some of the violations are worse than others, such as those involving arsenic, nitrates or uranium contaminates. Some of the violations, he added, could be less severe. ""All violations have some kind of health risk associated,"" he added.  California Gov. Gavin Newsom delivered his first State of the State Address on Feb. 12, 2018. AP photo.  Not everyone is counted Hinton said on top of those living in regulated districts, there are many thousands more who live in small, rural communities that rely on unregulated private wells. Some of those wells also experience contamination, but aren’t counted in the water board report. A McClatchy investigation published in June 2018 found at least 6 million Californians are served by water providers that have been in violation of state standards at some point since 2012. Darrin Polhemus, deputy director for the water board's division of drinking water, said Newsom’s figure is accurate based on a tally this month of the regulated, public water systems alone. That report includes violations for an additional contaminant, the cancer-causing man-made chemical Trichloropropane, referred to as 1,2,3,-TCP. The addition of that contaminant boosts the number of people living in a regulated district to ""now over one million people,"" he said.   ""The estimated population … of the public water systems regulated by the State Water Board that are currently out of compliance is 1,081,328,"" Polhemus said in an email. ""This number increased recently because we added those systems that are now out of compliance with our 1,2,3-TCP Maximum Contaminant Level."" Our ruling Gov. Gavin Newsom claimed ""more than a million Californians"" don’t have ""clean water to bathe in or drink."" A group that advocates for clean drinking water and a UC Davis researcher agreed with Newsom’s figure, with the researcher saying the number is significantly higher than one million. They pointed to a state water board report showing nearly 600,000 people lived in a regulated public water district that received a water quality violation in 2017. They noted that many thousands more people live in districts with unregulated and contaminated private wells but are not counted on the water board’s tally. The deputy director of the water board’s drinking water division added that a report from this month, which adds violations for a new cancer-causing contaminant, boosts the number of people in regulated water districts alone to more than one million people.

Donald Trump exaggerates when describing drop in violent crime
","In remarks to a conference of law enforcement officials, President Donald Trump touted gains on crime during his tenure. ""Violent crime is now going down for the first time in a long while,"" Trump said during the Feb. 13 address to the joint conference of the Major County Sheriffs of America and the Major Cities Chiefs Association. This remark came after numerous assertions by Trump during and after the 2016 presidential campaign that crime was spiking. We found many of those statements misleading or wrong, though others were reasonably accurate. Trump’s broadest statements about a rising crime wave were wrong, but some of his more specific statements about increases of specific crimes in specific places were more accurate. Trump’s description here -- that overall violent crime is falling after a long rise -- is misleading. (The White House did not respond to an inquiry for this article.) Let’s first look at the violent crime rate in recent years. We turned to historical data from the FBI, which is complete through 2017. The FBI defines violent crime as the combined number of instances of murder and nonnegligent manslaughter, rape, robbery, and aggravated assault. The rate shows the number of violent crimes per 100,000 population. Here’s a chart showing the FBI’s national violent crime rate from 1986 to 2017: The violent crime rate did fall between 2016 and 2017 (by less than 1 percent) and that was the first time it had done so since 2014. However, three years is hardly ""a long while"" ago, particularly given that the violent crime rate fell from year to year in 22 of the past 27 years. In fact, the 2017 violent crime rate was about half of what it was at its peak in 1991. ""The short-term spike occurred after a long-term slide,"" said James Alan Fox, a Northeastern University criminologist. ""The most recent drop was a change back to a level that existed before the two-year increase about which Trump has made much too much."" Trump said ""violent crime,"" but what if we looked more specifically at the murder rate? The murder rate seems to still be on a slight rise. Unlike the violent crime rate, it didn’t fall between 2016 and 2017, according to the FBI statistics. It went up by a small amount, from 5.3 per 100,000 to 5.4 per 100,000. The general pattern is similar to that of the violent crime rate — a peak in the early 1990s, a long fall through about 2014, then a modest uptick for the past few years. The most recent year in which the murder rate fell was 2013; in 2014, it was steady. Neither year was a ""long while"" ago. It’s worth noting that other crime statistics cited by Trump in his speech were better supported -- again, with more specific statements tending to be more accurate. He said, ""Murders in America’s largest cities dropped by 6 percent compared to 2016."" This is similar to the findings of a report released in December by the liberal Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School. That report — based on early data for big cities rather than on the official, full-year FBI data we used above — found that ""the 2018 murder rate in the 30 largest cities is estimated to decline by nearly 6 percent."" (The base year was 2017, not 2016, as Trump said.) Trump also said, ""In the two years before my inauguration, violent crime increased by 8 percent nationwide, and murders were up by more than 20 percent."" The FBI data shows that Trump is close. The violent crime rate increased by 7 percent between 2014 and 2016, and the murder rate rose by 18 percent during the same span. Trump said, ""Violent crime is now going down for the first time in a long while."" Violent crime has been on a downward trajectory for some time, with an occasional uptick. Official FBI data shows that the violent crime rate went down very slightly — by less than 1 percent — between 2016 and 2017. But that statistic has fallen as recently as 2014, and it has declined in 22 of the past 27 years, with today’s rate half of what it was in 1991. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6BD340>],/factchecks/2019/feb/14/donald-trump/donald-trump-exaggerates-when-describing-drop-viol/

Fact-checking claim that Mitch McConnell's 'biggest donor' is sanctioned Russian oligarch
","A screenshot of a tweet spreading online accuses Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., of receiving donations from a Russian oligarch who the GOP-controlled Congress recently lifted sanctions on. The tweet reads: ""Ready for this? It turns out that the biggest donor for Mitch McConnell (R. Moscow) is none other than the Russian oligarch that the GOP just lifted sanctions on."" The same post links to a Jan. 28 Medium post by the Democratic Coalition, a super PAC founded in 2016 in opposition of Donald Trump. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) According to the Democratic Coalition’s story, Len Blavatnik, a dual U.S.-U.K. citizen, donated millions to McConnell’s campaign and Senate Leadership Fund in recent years via his company Access Holdings. The story also claims Blavatnik is a long-term business partner of Kremlin-linked Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska, of the aluminum company RuSal, ""in which (Blavatnik) is a major investor."" It then says McConnell led Republicans in January to vote against a resolution to maintain sanctions on Deripaska. We found that this isn’t all false, but the claim exaggerates Blavatnik’s contributions to McConnell as being his ""biggest"" donor, and makes it look as if Blavatnik is the Russian oligarch affected by sanctions. In fact, it was another Russian with whom he conducted business. Blavatnik emigrated to the United States with his family in the late 1970s and returned to Russia in the late ’80s as the Soviet Union began to collapse. His U.S.-based holding companies — Access Industries Inc. and AI-Altep Holdings Inc. — are conduits for his largest political contributions, according to Federal Election Commission records. In 2015-16, Blavatnik’s contributions went to GOP PACs and top Republican leaders, including McConnell, according to FEC records. In that cycle, his companies contributed over $6.3 million, with $2.5 million going to McConnell’s Senate Leadership Fund. In 2017, Blavatnik donated another $1 million to the committee, records show, bringing the total to $3.5 million. While Blavatnik certainly donated a lot of money to McConnell’s committee, he is nowhere near the majority leader’s highest contributor. In the 2017-18 cycle alone, at least two other donors, Sheldon D. Adelson and Miriam Adelson, gave $25 million (a piece) to his leadership fund. In April 2018, the Trump administration announced sanctions on multiple Russian oligarchs and their companies, including Deripaska and his aluminum company Rusal, the second-largest aluminium company in the world. Deripaska is known to be closely allied with the Kremlin, and his name has come up in emails turned over to the Mueller investigation.   Then, in December, the administration agreed to lift the sanctions on Deripaska’s companies in exchange for him giving up majority ownership, along with other concessions. About a month later, McConnell led Senate Republicans and blocked a Democratic effort to keep the sanctions on Deripaska’s companies. Now that we are all caught up, how are Blavatnik and Deripaska connected? As two of the richest Russian men in the United Kingdom, it’s not entirely surprising they have had business dealings. According to a report by the Dallas News, Blavatnik and business partner Viktor Vekselburg hold a 20.5 percent stake in Rusal. (Vekselberg made news in May 2018 after it was revealed that a U.S. firm he invests in wired $500,000 to a company owned by Michael Cohen, Trump’s former attorney.) A post says McConnell’s ""biggest donor"" is a Russian oligarch who was released from U.S. sanctions. Blavatnik is involved in Deripaska’s businesses, on which sanctions were lifted recently, but it is inaccurate to call him the Russian oligarch ""that the GOP just lifted sanctions on."" Blavatnik also donated money to McConnell’s Senate Leadership Fund, but he wasn’t the highest donor, records show. He also contributed to other Republican leaders and GOP-affiliated PACs. The attack on McConnell gets a lot of the details wrong. So we rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECC057C0>],/factchecks/2019/feb/14/facebook-posts/fact-checking-claim-mitch-mcconnells-biggest-donor/

Does U.S. have more gun deaths in 1 day than other countries in 1 year?
","A week before the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School mass shooting anniversary, the House Judiciary Committee held its first hearing on gun violence in nearly a decade. Committee chairman U.S. Rep. Jerrold Nadler,  D-N.Y., opened the hearing with a sobering statement: ""Every day in America, on average, 34 people are murdered with a firearm, and more than 183 people are injured in an attack."" Nadler warned of the prevalence of U.S. gun violence compared with other industrialized countries. ""But while no other country in the industrialized world would tolerate such statistics — in fact, gun deaths in most of those countries barely crack triple digits annually — in the United States, it is accepted as a grim reality,"" Nadler said. ""By comparison, in 2011, for example, the United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; and Japan, 30. But last year, in the United States, almost 40,000."" The House Judiciary Committee passed HR 8, the Bipartisan Background Checks Act, by a 23-15 vote on Feb. 13, prepping it for a full House vote. It is not expected to pass the Republican-led Senate. Nadler’s comparison highlights the magnitude of gun deaths in the United States, and we were curious to find out if his statement is accurate. The claim in absolute numbers doesn't account for massive differences in population. Denmark, for example, has 5.7 million people, while the United States has 325.7 million. That said, when you factor in the rate of gun deaths, the United States remains an outlier.  Nadler’s estimate for U.S. gun deaths is basically right (although we don’t have numbers for 2018 yet). When he said ""last year,"" he was most likely pointing to the number of gun deaths in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That year, 39,773 deaths were related to firearms. The number captures deaths resulting from suicides, homicides, unintentional and undetermined deaths as well as those from law enforcement. Nadler claimed there are an average of 34 deaths and 183 injuries resulting from firearm assaults per day, which echoes a five-year average calculated by the Brady Campaign to Protect Gun Violence, a nonprofit gun control advocacy group. The numbers creep higher when looking at 2017 alone, we found. An average of almost 40 people were murdered every day with a firearm in 2017. And 107,002 nonfatal gunshot injuries involved firearm assaults in 2017, according to the CDC, or about 293 injuries per day. According to the CDC database, the number of nonfatal injuries related to firearm assaults grew sharply from 62,896 in 2015, to 88,702 in 2016, before hiking to 107,002 in 2017. Deaths from homicides involving firearms also rose. Nadler compared the United States’ annual total in 2017 against other countries’ numbers in 2011. (Back in 2011, 32,351 in the United States lost their lives because of guns.) Nadler’s numbers are consistent with the number of deaths on Gunpolicy.org, a public health database hosted by the University of Sydney. Its numbers are gleaned from the World Health Organization's Mortality Database. More recent data is available for Denmark (82 in 2014), Japan (28 in 2014), Portugal (155 in 2014) and the U.K. (144 in 2013). Experts pointed out that Nadler highlighted a small sample, leaving out a couple of advanced countries with higher gun death counts. For example, France saw about 2,330 firearm-related deaths in 2016, while Germany had 1,220 firearm mortalities that year, according to the study Global Mortality From Firearms, 1990-2016 done by researchers at the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. Also, it is important to consider differences in population size when drawing comparisons with other countries. ""Nevertheless, the point he’s making — that the United States has far more gun deaths than any other industrialized nation, and far more per capita than any other industrialized nation — is correct,"" said Philip Cook, a prominent gun researcher and Duke University emeritus professor of public policy. While there is no uniform definition of industrialized countries, a 2016 study published in the American Journal of Medicine compared the total firearm death rates per 100,000 people among high-income Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development member countries in 2010. Among most industrialized countries, the United States does have an outstanding rate of firearms mortality and almost triples the rate of the next country in line, Finland. Finland had a gun-related death rate of 3.6 per 100,000 people in 2010. The gap between the U.S. and other countries’ firearm-related death rate widened between 2010 and 2016. This does not make the United States the leading country for violent gun deaths in the world. Our previous reporting looked into violent gun death rates internationally (excluding suicides and others) in 2016 and found that the U.S. ranks No.10 worldwide, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation. El Salvador (40.29), Venezuela (34.77) and Guatemala (28.81) had the highest firearm homicide rates per 100,000 people, as compared to 3.85 in the United States. Nadler said, ""In 2011, for example, the United Kingdom had 146 deaths due to gun violence; Denmark, 71; Portugal, 142; and Japan, 30. But last year, in the United States, almost 40,000."" The numbers Nadler mentioned were largely accurate for their corresponding years, but his claim was missing some context. Some of Nadler’s exact figures were dated, and they didn’t consider each country’s relative population. Still, the most recent figure shows that magnitude and rate of firearm-related deaths in the United States surpass most, if not all, of its industrialized counterparts.

Studies mostly support NC governor's claim about uninsured veterans
","For over a year, Democrats have said they want to expand Medicaid to provide more health insurance coverage for the poor. North Carolina has participated in the program since 1970, but is one of 17 states that hasn’t expanded its coverage in recent years. Gov. Roy Cooper and others say expanding Medicaid would provide coverage for hundreds of thousands of North Carolinians. And, according to Cooper, tens of thousands are military veterans. ""It is embarrassing that 30,000 veterans in North Carolina have no health insurance and if we expand Medicaid 23,000 of them will,"" Cooper said in an interview with The News & Observer that was posted on Twitter. Cooper isn’t the first North Carolina Democrat to make this claim. In September, state Senate candidate JD Wooten made a similar statement in a campaign video. ""My opponent, Rick Gunn, blocked the expansion of Medicaid — costing half a million people health insurance, including at least 23,000 veterans,"" Wooten said in a caption posted with the video.

Were 23,000 veterans among those affected? — before rating the claim Mostly True. With that in mind, let’s focus on the first part of Cooper claim. Is it true that 30,000 veterans are without health insurance? PolitiFact couldn’t find statistics for 2018, 2017 or 2016. And the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs doesn’t track the number of uninsured veterans, a spokeswoman told PolitiFact on Thursday. However, we found credible data from 2015 and 2014. Based on those reports, Cooper’s estimate appears to be on point. A PAIR OF STUDIES Contacted by PolitiFact, Cooper’s office cited one of the same sources mentioned in the Wooten fact check: a 2016 study on the effects of the Affordable Care Act on veterans. The study was conducted by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, a nonprofit philanthropic organization that focuses on health care; and the Urban Institute, a think tank that researches the effects of economic and social policies. (When contacted by PolitiFact, the NC Department of Health and Human Services also cited this Urban Institute report. The NC DHHS doesn’t track uninsured veterans, said Chris Mackey, the department’s director of communications.) The study says there were 30,000 uninsured veterans in North Carolina as of 2014. It had been 43,000 in 2013. Cooper’s office also cited a 2017 report by the Kaiser Family Foundation, a leading authority on health care research. North Carolina was home to 26,680 uninsured veterans in 2015, according to a chart in Kaiser’s report on Medicaid’s Role in Covering Veterans. The chart represents Kaiser’s most recent estimate, according to Craig Palosky, Kaiser’s director of communications. So Cooper’s number seems reasonable. It’s possible the number of uninsured veterans has fluctuated since 2015. But available estimates put his claim on the money, or within 3,320 veterans. WHO IS UNINSURED? Don’t all veterans have insurance through the military or the VA? Not necessarily. Unless veterans were dishonorably discharged, the VA website says most are eligible for some sort of coverage. There are variables that determine the extent of a veterans’ coverage. But most who served at least 24 continuous months after enlisting in September 1980 or entering active duty in October 1981 are eligible for some sort of coverage. However, there are so many other considerations. And in 2016, about 510,000 veterans lacked insurance, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. ""Eligibility for the VA health care system is based on veteran status, service-connected disability status, income level and other factors. Moreover, not all eligible veterans actually use VA for their health care, and some may not realize they are eligible for VA health care,"" the Census bureau wrote in a report published in 2017. The Census Bureau also found that the number of low-income veterans on Medicaid increased between 2013 and 2016. ""Between 2013 and 2016, the percentage of working-age veterans who had Medicaid increased most for those who lived in poverty. The number of working-age veterans with Medicaid also increased during this period,"" the bureau reported. The VA says veterans with questions can call its health benefits helpline at 1-877-222-8387 Monday through Friday between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. Eastern Standard Time. OUR RULING Cooper said 30,000 veterans in North Carolina have no health insurance. PolitiFact doesn’t know how many veterans lack health insurance as of 2019. While we wish Cooper had used the word ""estimate"" in his statement, his claim comes pretty close to estimates by two reputable organizations. One group said there are 30,000 as of 2014, and the other said there were about 26,600 as of 2015. It’s possible those numbers have fluctuated since then. With that in mind, we rate this claim Mostly True.

No, Robert Mueller didn't say we need a one-world government
","Supporters of President Donald Trump have cast aspersions on special counsel Robert Mueller and his investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. Amid the allegations, we found a suspicious Mueller quote that plays to some conspiracy theories around the probe. ""We must move as quickly as possible to a one-world government; a one-world religion; under a one world leader,"" a post published on Facebook on Feb. 11 reads. The text appears above a picture of Mueller speaking. It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Websites like Twitter and me.me have similar posts attributing the quote to Mueller. But after searching online, we couldn’t find any legitimate sources that Mueller actually said it. We did find several sources attributing the quote to someone with a similar name: Robert Muller, a former assistant secretary-general for the United Nations. The sources include a 2013 Facebook post and books like ""On the Way to the Future: Daniel’s Visions and the Believer’s Hope,"" published in 2014 from author Ray Stedman, a pastor from California writing about biblical prophecies. PolitiFact couldn’t confirm that Muller actually said this either. The United Nations did not immediately respond to questions about the quote’s authenticity, and we did not find a credible citation. What does seem clear is that a quote attributed to Robert Muller (one ""e"") has been co-opted by detractors of Robert Mueller (two ""e""s). But as far as we can tell, the special counsel never said it. We rate this claim Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBED1600>],/factchecks/2019/feb/14/viral-image/no-robert-mueller-didnt-say-we-need-one-world-gove/
