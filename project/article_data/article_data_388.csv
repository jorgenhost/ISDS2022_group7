Carroll Foy partially right about investigations of past Virginia governors
","Democrat Jennifer Carroll Foy said a key reason she’s running for governor is to rid Virginia's government of corruption. ""Two out of our last three governors in Virginia were investigated by the FBI,"" she said during a March 16 debate. ""One went to jail and one is running for office again in this election."" A fact check of Carroll Foy’s statement finds she’s right on the FBI probes, but wrong in saying one of the governors was locked up. Republican Bob McDonnell was investigated by the FBI, and his case had enormous consequences. Ten days after his term expired in 2014, McDonnell was indicted on federal corruption charges for accepting $165,000 in gifts and loans from businessman Jonnie Williams Sr.. In exchange, authorities said McDonnell used the influence of the governor’s office to promote Williams’ diet supplement business. McDonnell was found guilty on 11 counts of corruption and, in January 2015, was sentenced to two years in prison by Senior U.S. District Judge James Spencer. But contrary to Carroll Foy’s statement, McDonnell never spent a day in prison. He remained free through his appeals and, in June 2016, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously vacated his conviction, saying some of the courtesies McDonnell gave Williams, such as setting up meetings with state officials who were in a position to help Williams’ business, did not qualify as an ""official act"" of corruption despite McDonnell’s acceptance gifts. Prosecutors declined to try McDonnell again under a more narrow definition of corruption. Sharon Yang, a spokesperson for Carroll Foy, said the candidate ""misspoke"" in saying McDonnell went to jail Democrat Terry McAuliffe was also investigated by the FBI during his gubernatorial term from 2013-2017, but he was never accused of wrongdoing - an important fact Carroll Foy omits. McAuliffe is running for his old office again this year. Virginia does not allow its governors to serve successive terms. News of the investigation broke on May 23, 2016 and McAuliffe professed ""shock,"" saying he knew nothing about it. James W. Cooper, McAuliffe’s private lawyer, said two days later that the FBI was looking into whether McAuliffe - before becoming governor - had accepted foreign money to lobby without telling federal government.  McAuliffe was not indicted and news about the probe quickly fizzled out. We asked the FBI if the probe was active and were told the agency does not confirm or deny the existence of any investigation.  ""Nothing came of the investigation and it’s not ongoing."" said Jake Rubenstein, a McAuliffe spokesman. Our ruling Carroll Foy said, ""Two out of our last three governors in Virginia were investigated by the FBI. One went to jail and one is running for office again in this election."" She’s right that McDonnell and McAuliffe were investigated by the FBI during their terms, but Carroll Foy omits that McAuliffe was never accused of wrongdoing. McDonnell, on the other hand, was convicted of corruption and sentenced to two years in prison. The Supreme Court vacated his conviction, however, and McDonnell never spent a moment behind bars. Carroll Foy’s campaign acknowledges she misspoke on this part of her claim. Overall, we rate Carroll Foy’s statement Half True. CORRECTION, April 5, 2021: An earlier version of this story had the wrong last name for Jake Rubenstein.

Voter impersonation is rare, North Carolina's Cooper says
","With Georgia lawmakers adopting new voter identification requirements, CNN’s Jake Tapper sought perspective from a politician who’s witnessed a similar push for election security in the South: North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper. North Carolina lawmakers in 2013 passed a voter ID law that was later struck down, and then enacted new voter ID laws after a voter referendum in 2018. Cooper, who witnessed the state’s initial voter ID push while serving as attorney general, told Tapper he believes photo ID requirements are unnecessary. ""You do need security to make sure that people’s votes count and that people aren’t cheating. But the problem is you don’t see widespread problems with things they’re trying to attack, like voter ID,"" Cooper said in the segment, which he tweeted on March 26. ""People don’t go in and pretend to be someone else to go in and vote,"" he continued. ""You just don’t see that kind of fraud. Yet you have legislation that is making it harder and harder for people to vote.""  Cooper, a Democrat, suggested voter impersonation isn’t a ""widespread problem."" Is that right? Generally speaking, yes. While it has happened, it is extremely rare. PolitiFact has written about this topic multiple times, even finding in April 2016 that people were more likely to be struck by lightning than to impersonate someone else at the polls.  We thought we’d check-in with experts again, since there have been two presidential elections since that lightning comparison. The findings haven’t changed. While there have been a few dozen documented cases of voter impersonation over the years, the incidents have had so little impact on elections that experts have referred to the issue as ""virtually nonexistent.""  First, let’s clarify what we’re talking about here. There are many kinds of voter fraud and Cooper’s comment is only directed at one of them: voter impersonation. Fraud can also happen when people:  Groups such as the left-leaning Brennan Center and the conservative Heritage Foundation have followed fraud cases over the years. However, there’s no official government database that’s constantly updating a list of impersonation cases across the U.S. In other words, we don’t have exact numbers on what percentage of voter fraud cases involve impersonation, specifically. But experts say the number is very low. The Brennan Center reports impersonation is ""virtually nonexistent."" News21, a student reporting project based at Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism, in 2012 used the same language — ""virtually non-existent""— after analyzing 2,068 cases of alleged election-fraud dating back to 2000. Justin Levitt, a democracy scholar at the Loyola Law School, is considered a leading source of information for voter fraud and election laws. Levitt authored what the Brennan Center considers its seminal report on the issue, ""The Truth About Voter Fraud,"" which in 2007 found impersonation incident rates between 0.0003% and 0.0025%. Levitt has continued researching fraud cases across the country, finding 31 potential incidents between 2000 and 2014.  Levitt says he looked for the type of fraud that photo ID laws might stop, meaning he excluded cases that involved a fake ID or tampering by a poll worker. He also said he documented credible cases, not just those that are prosecuted.  Levitt says he has continued to receive reports of fraud since 2014 and is now up to about 45 total cases, he told PolitiFact NC in an email. ""I continue to welcome additional reports of impersonation fraud, if they’re specific and credible,"" he said. However, he added, ""Claims of irregularity vastly exceed actual incidents of irregularity. Second, most irregularity involves mistake or misinformation rather than intentional malfeasance."" The Heritage Foundation created a database on its website that chronicles different types of fraud. Its database, which the group says isn’t comprehensive, features 13 cases of impersonation fraud dating back to 2004. In North Carolina, the State Elections Board has referred seven cases of impersonation fraud for prosecution dating back to 2015. The board referred four cases from the 2020 election to prosecutors, according to board spokesman Patrick Gannon. One case was declined and three are pending district attorney review, he said. More than 5.5 million people in North Carolina voted in the 2020 general election. ""Voter impersonation is rare in North Carolina,"" Gannon told PolitiFact NC in an email. ""Often, cases of voter impersonation involve a family member or loved one casting a ballot for a recently deceased loved one."" Both of the cases the board referred for prosecution in 2016 involved family members casting a ballot on behalf of a recently-deceased loved one, he said. Rick Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, told PolitiFact NC that impersonation fraud is ""by far the least prevalent type of election fraud there is."" Hasen’s books, ""The Voting Wars"" in 2012 and ""Election Meltdown'' in 2020, each examine reports of fraud across the country. For the latter book, Hasen scoured records looking for historical accounts of coordinated voter impersonation. He found none. ""It is an exceedingly dumb way to steal an election,"" he wrote in Election Meltdown. ""Because one would have to hire people to go to the polls claiming to be someone else, hope that the people being impersonated had not yet voted, hope that the people being paid to commit felonies would actually cast a secret ballot the way the payer wants, and repeat this process undetected on a large enough scale to sway an election."" Lorraine Minnite, professor of political science at Rutgers University, wrote ""The Myth of Voter Fraud,"" in 2010. In an interview with News21 and reprinted in Governing magazine, Minnite described voter impersonation as an ""irrational behavior."" ""You’re not likely to change the outcome of an election with your illegal fraudulent vote, and the chances of being caught are there and we have rules to prevent against it,"" she told News21. Cooper said ""People don’t go in and pretend to be someone else to go in and vote. You just don’t see that kind of fraud."" It’s possible that someone could interpret Cooper’s comments to mean that no one has ever committed voter impersonation fraud. Experts have counted a few dozen cases over the past two decades. But Cooper is right that, statistically, it almost never happens. Experts say impersonation attempts are the least common types of voter fraud, describing it as virtually non-existent.

Citizens United calls Biden’s infrastructure plan the Green New Deal. It isn’t.
","Republican opposition to President Joe Biden’s infrastructure proposal has been swift and vocal. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said that as written, the $2.3 trillion American Jobs Plan released March 31 was a nonstarter. The conservative PAC Citizens United put Biden’s plan in the same boat as the Green New Deal, a sweeping environmental and social justice agenda that Republicans have condemned. ""Does this sound like an infrastructure bill to you?"" the group tweeted March 31, with a link to a New York Times article about the proposal. ""It's not. It's the Green New Deal. "" Does this sound like an infrastructure bill to you? It's not. It's the Green New Deal. ""It is the first step in a two-part agenda to overhaul American capitalism, fight climate change and attempt to improve the productivity of the economy.""https://t.co/ajIoRCttgl The Times article described Biden’s plan as the first step in a legislative package that aimed to boost productivity, fight climate change and ""overhaul American capitalism."" During the presidential campaign, Biden said he does not support the Green New Deal. His current proposal is a blend of money for traditional brick-and-mortar infrastructure — roads, water supplies, broadband, etc. — clean energy and improved manufacturing, and social service infrastructure, meaning caregivers for seniors and the disabled. We called and emailed Citizens United to ask on what basis they equated the White House initiative with the Green New Deal. We did not hear back. There’s overlap between the two, but also considerable differences. The Green New Deal was a House resolution introduced by Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., that laid out a set of climate, economic and social goals. Ocasio-Cortez criticized the Biden plan, saying ""This is not nearly enough."" The 2019 resolution was not a line-by-line spending plan. But the Green New Deal inspired the crafting of the THRIVE Act, legislation due to be introduced in April by a group of Democrats in Congress to advance the goals of the resolution. The THRIVE Act does have a proposed budget. The Green New Deal Network, a group of advocacy groups, summarized it in a spreadsheet, and it comes out to much more than the American Jobs Plan.  Over a 10-year span, it would spend about $9.5 trillion, or about $7 trillion more than Biden’s proposal. Two of the largest differences are in the areas of clean energy and agriculture. The THRIVE Act would spend about 10 times more than the American Jobs Plan on clean energy. For agriculture, the White House has no spending line, while the THRIVE Act has $1.6 trillion to support farming that uses less fossil fuels and locks more carbon in the soil. (The recently passed stimulus law provided about $5.6 billion in aid to farmers and rural communities.) Here is our summary of how the two spending plans compare across some major categories. The American Jobs Plan also includes about $480 billion to boost manufacturing and research and development, some of which might boost clean energy. The THRIVE Act folds money for those activities into other line items, primarily its investments in clean energy. Ryan Schleeter, spokesman for Greenpeace USA, a Green New Deal Network member, said it is misleading to equate Biden’s proposal with the Green New Deal. ""The American Jobs Plan is similar in intent to the THRIVE Act, but far narrower in scope and scale,"" Schleeter said. Among the broader items on the original Green New Deal agenda were a guaranteed livable wage, affordable higher education and universal health care. The American Jobs Plan does not include those elements. Citizens United said that Biden’s infrastructure proposal is the Green New Deal. The two plans share some common approaches, but a spending plan inspired by the Green New Deal is about four times larger than the Biden plan. The Green New Deal also advocates broader social goals that are absent from the White House infrastructure proposal.

Wisconsin Republicans passed one COVID bill before long period of inaction
","Amid a pandemic that changed almost every part of Wisconsin life in 2020, one thing was nearly constant — inaction from the Republican-led Legislature. In October, we rated True a claim that Wisconsin Republicans hadn’t passed a single bill in six months, a streak that ultimately ran through the end of the year. We noted Wisconsin lawmakers had done less than almost any other state to address the pandemic despite being one of just 10 full-time Legislatures in the nation. That streak ended in February. Republicans passed a $100 million COVID response bill that was vetoed by Democratic Gov. Tony Evers, but the two sides came together later that month on a bill that overhauled the state unemployment system while also expanding jobless benefits and protecting businesses and governments from coronavirus-related lawsuits. A month later, Evers took aim at the Republicans’ pandemic record while pitching his plan to spend $3.2 billion in new federal coronavirus aid. ""It took the Legislature nearly 300 days to act on a #COVID19 bill during this pandemic,"" Evers tweeted on March 30, 2021. ""We simply cannot afford to waste any time or let Republicans play politics and prevent these funds from going to folks who need our help."" Let’s take a closer look at that 300 days claim. The key question is how one interprets Evers’ reference, which is imprecise. Many would no doubt take this statement to mean the Legislature didn’t pass a COVID-19 bill for the first 300 days of the pandemic. And that’s inaccurate. RELATED: Steineke’s actions, words don’t match on COVID-19 bill Evers imposed his ""Safer at Home"" order on March 25, 2020, and within weeks the Legislature passed a broad COVID-19 relief bill that Evers signed on April 15, 2020. That bill: Made workers’ compensation available to healthcare workers who contracted COVID-19 (though controversially only if they could prove they were exposed while working on a person with the virus) Suspended the one-week waiting period before people who are out of work may collect unemployment benefits Provided insurance protection for those infected with coronavirus and shielded health care providers from liability Barred insurers from charging people more to get COVID-19 treatment out of network Required insurers to cover coronavirus testing for free That bill, however, was the last coronavirus-related action the Legislature passed for about 300 days. That’s the point Evers was making, said spokeswoman Britt Cudaback. ""The tweet says a COVID-19 bill because it did, in fact, take the Legislature nearly 300 days to pass a COVID-19 bill, and not for lack of the governor’s or public’s urging to pass it sooner,"" Cudaback said in an email. The phrasing could also be taken to say the Legislature stalled a particular bill for 300 days, which is also inaccurate. Evers raised a variety of potential bills during that legislative drought, but no specific bill that was ignored for that length of time. Sinec February 2021, the Legislature has passed several other COVID-related bills, including measures that allowed pharmacy technicians, pharmacy students and dentists to administer the vaccine. Evers said, ""It took the Legislature nearly 300 days to act on a (COVID-19) bill during this pandemic."" It didn’t take 300 days for the Legislature to take any action on the pandemic, as a wide-ranging bill was signed into law in April 2020. But the Republican-run Senate and Assembly did take a 300-day hiatus from passing legislation after that point, which stretched all the way to February 2021. That lines up with our definition of Half True: a statement that is ""partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.""  ",/factchecks/2021/apr/02/tony-evers/republicans-passed-one-covid-bill-long-period-inac/

Social media posts wrongly claim vaccination can happen only during lockdowns
","The U.S. and the U.K. approved the first COVID-19 vaccines for emergency use months ago, clearing the way for the millions of people to be inoculated. Now, social media users are falling for posts that claim, wrongly, that the vaccines’ emergency approvals are a sign that government-imposed ""lockdown"" measures are here to say. ""The vaccine is authorised for emergency use only and still in live clinical trials until 2023,"" says a March 25 tweet from a British poster. ""They’re unable to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends because the emergency ends with it. Hence why, lockdowns won’t end anytime soon.""  A screenshot of the March 25 tweet about vaccines and lockdowns. That’s not true, public health experts said. In both the U.S. and the U.K., the authorizations for the vaccine are not tied to stay-at-home orders and other restrictions to limit the virus’ spread.  But the tweet spread widely online, with screenshots of it posted on Facebook and Instagram receiving thousands of interactions, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool.  The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Social media users left comments on Facebook and Instagram indicating that they thought the claim was about the U.S., but the person who authored the original tweet told PolitiFact he was posting from the U.K. So, PolitiFact spoke to experts and government regulatory agencies from both countries.  A screenshot of an Instagram post sharing the March 25 tweet about vaccines and lockdowns. We found that no matter which side of the Atlantic Ocean you’re on, it’s inaccurate to say that ""they’re unable to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends.""  Asked for evidence to support the claim, the person behind the tweet did not provide any. He later said in a direct message on Twitter: ""To be clear, I have no idea if this is correct or not."" One problem with the tweet is the claim that ""lockdowns won’t end anytime soon."" The U.K. is starting to ease the restrictions imposed by law in January to limit gatherings and minimize the virus’ spread — restrictions that news outlets have referred to as a lockdown. But in the U.S., there is no nationwide lockdown and never was. Masks are currently required in about half the states, but businesses across the country are mostly open, and no state is enforcing a mandatory curfew or stay-at-home order, according to the New York Times.   ""The U.S. government hasn’t locked anything down,"" said John Grabenstein, associate director for scientific communications at the Immunization Action Coalition. The main problem with the tweet, however, is the inaccurate claim that lifting restrictions would mean losing the ability to continue vaccinating the population against COVID-19. There is no connection between lockdowns and vaccine administration — in either country. In both the U.K. and the U.S., regulators granted emergency use authorization to manufacturers such as Pfizer after their COVID-19 vaccines were proven in trials to be safe and effective. The manufacturers will continue monitoring participants in their final clinical trials, as the tweet says. ""Each of the companies wants to get full licensing,"" Grabenstein said, adding that they are ""well on their way"" toward doing so. ""The government wants them to earn their license."" However, the emergency use authorizations that greenlighted the vaccines don’t make the U.S. and U.K. ""unable to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends,"" experts agreed. In the U.S., stay-at-home orders and other restrictions are handed down at the state and local levels, while the emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines were provided by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, a federal agency.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration building in Silver Spring, Md., on Dec. 10, 2020. (AP) The emergency approval has ""nothing"" to do with lockdowns, said Andrew Noymer, associate professor of population health and disease prevention at the University of California, Irvine. Instead, emergency use authorizations are temporary licenses granted while manufacturers collect more data and apply for full licenses, Noymer said. The FDA can grant them if the health and human services secretary has declared that a public health emergency justifies it. Alex Azar, the secretary under the Trump administration, made such a declaration Feb. 4, 2020. In a statement to PolitiFact, the FDA said that unless they are revoked, the emergency use authorizations will remain in effect until the public health emergency declaration is lifted.  ""The vaccines can be used under an emergency use authorization as long as there is a declared emergency,"" said Joshua Sharfstein, vice dean for public health practice and community engagement at Johns Hopkins University. ""But a declared emergency does not require that there be ‘lockdowns.’ There can still be a declared emergency and vaccination without ‘lockdowns.’"" In 2009, for example, the FDA granted several emergency use authorizations related to the swine flu, but the country never locked down. In the U.K., regulators at the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency granted emergency approval to vaccines from Pfizer, Moderna and Oxford University.  Such temporary licenses are allowed under British law during a public health emergency and while the full licensing process runs its course. In 2020, the law was amended to make them ""as similar to a usual marketing authorization as possible,"" an MHRA spokesperson said. The COVID-19 restrictions constituting a lockdown, however, were voted on by Parliament. As in the U.S., lockdowns have no bearing on those emergency approvals, experts said. ""I am 99.9999% certain that emergency use does not equal a period of lockdown, said John Edmunds, professor of epidemiology and population health at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, adding that the concept of emergency use has been around for years. It wouldn’t make sense for any government to ""bind its hands"" by tying lockdowns to the ability to continue administering vaccines, Grabenstein added. The MHRA’s conditions for authorizing the COVID-19 vaccines say the approvals ""will be valid until expressly withdrawn by MHRA or upon issue of a full market authorisation by the MHRA.""  Given that language and other language on the MHRA’s website, the duration of the temporary license appears to be within the MHRA’s discretion, said Christopher Newdick, a professor of medical law and contract law at the University of Reading.  ""It is not tied to the duration of the emergency lockdown described by the COVID regulations,"" Newdick said. ""So the licensing status of the vaccines is subject to a different range of considerations to do with safety and efficacy and a different timescale."" Social media posts said ""they’re unable to administer vaccines if the lockdown ends because the emergency ends with it."" That’s inaccurate in both the U.S. and the U.K., where emergency approvals were granted to vaccine manufacturers separate from any decisions to impose restrictions meant to thwart the virus.

Video gives inaccurate reading of redistricting overhaul in HR 1
","An expansive voting rights bill known as H.R. 1 includes provisions on voter registration procedures, mail balloting, voter ID laws and campaign finance. One less-discussed, but far-reaching aspect of the law surrounds congressional redistricting — the process by which states redraw district lines for their House delegation every 10 years after the census. The bill has passed the House narrowly, on a near-party-line vote. It is now under consideration in the Senate. The redistricting provisions seek to address longstanding complaints that state legislators — who redraw the lines in most states — have a vested interest in drawing lines that benefit their own party, a practice known as gerrymandering. The bill would require all states to use a system like one used in several states already, where the final lines win approval from a cross-section of Republicans, Democrats and independents on a special commission. The redistricting provisions became the focus of an attack by the conservative group Turning Point USA in a recent video shared on Instagram.  The video says in part, ""States have the sovereignty to redistrict their own states, to decide where their congressional districts are. H.R. 1 destroys that right and gives the federal government the power to establish their own committees to violate the states’ sovereignty in drawing congressional districts. This is a federal committee you did not elect in charge of redistricting your state, your congressional district where you live."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook, which owns Instagram.)  We took a closer look at whether H.R. 1 ""gives the federal government the power to establish their own committees"" to take over the redistricting process.  We found that this description is misleading.  Turning Point USA did not respond to an inquiry for this article. Today, nine states have independent commissions that draw congressional district lines: Arizona, Colorado, California, Hawaii, Idaho, Michigan, New Jersey, Virginia, and Washington state. Montana also has an independent commission, but it currently has only one statewide congressional seat. Iowa, meanwhile, has a nonpartisan system that is considered similarly removed from politics.   In the other states, the legislature controls redistricting. Under H.R. 1, those states would need to shift the task to an independent commission. The expectation is that this switch would take place in time for the 2031 round of redistricting, said Michael Li, senior counsel at New York University’s Brennan Center for Justice.  According to the bill, the process would start with an existing nonpartisan state agency assembling a pool of qualified commissioners, screened for conflicts of interest. (The bill is vague about which officials would do this, but for its current commission, Arizona uses an appellate court personnel board, while California uses its state auditor's office.) The state agency would appoint six members to the commission from that pool: two from each major party and two from neither party. Then those six commissioners would appoint nine other commissioners from the pool, three from each major party and three from neither. This 15-member board would scrutinize the maps and propose new lines, with their meetings and underlying data open to the public.  A final map would have to win enough support from all three party groups.  While H.R. 1 leaves the nitty gritty of line-drawing to the commission, it does spell out some principles that should be upheld. They include, ""to the extent practicable,"" keeping ""communities of interest"" — such as counties, municipalities and reservations — whole. And the bill explicitly says that the new map cannot be drawn with ""the intent or the effect of unduly favoring or disfavoring any political party."" The bill does mandate an overhaul of how redistricting is done in most states. But the video misinterprets this change. The bill ""requires that the states establish their own committees,"" said David Daley, a senior fellow at FairVote, a voting-and-elections advocacy group. ""It does not give the federal government the power to establish those commissions for them."" Jon Eguia, a Michigan State University economist who has studied redistricting systems,  agreed: ""I don’t see the federal government establishing any committees under H.R. 1.""  ""You can say that H.R. 1 is bossy toward states, or that it takes away their right to decide how to conduct elections,"" he added. ""But I think the phrase (in the video) is misleading."" Whether the redistricting provisions of H.R. 1 would pass constitutional muster is still an open question.  Redistricting experts said that both supporters and opponents of the law would argue their case using the Constitution’s Elections Clause. That clause says:  ""The Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections for Senators and Representatives, shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof; but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations, except as to the Places of chusing Senators."" Critics of the bill will point to the phrase, ""shall be prescribed in each State by the Legislature thereof,"" arguing that the power rests with legislatures, rather than Congress. Meanwhile, supporters will point to the next phase, ""but the Congress may at any time by Law make or alter such Regulations,"" arguing that this gives Congress the upper hand on this issue. ""The founders gave Congress this power for exactly this reason, concerned that states might develop unfair election processes,"" Daley said. States might argue that requiring them to use commissions is an ""unconstitutional form of ‘commandeering’ of state government to serve a federal interest,"" Li said, ""but states made that same argument about the National Voter Registration Act, which was also enacted under the Elections Clause, and courts rejected it.""  Li also pointed to the 2019 Supreme Court case Rucho v. Common Cause, in which Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for a 5-4 majority, highlighted Congress’ power under the Elections Clause to overrule partisan gerrymanders. Specifically citing the precursor to H.R. 1, which was then pending in Congress, Roberts wrote that ""the Framers gave Congress the power to do something about partisan gerrymandering in the Elections Clause. … The avenue for reform established by the Framers, and used by Congress in the past, remains open."" Today, the Supreme Court has one more conservative member, however, so critics of H.R. 1 would likely sue if the bill passes.  Turning Point USA said that H.R. 1 ""gives the federal government the power to establish their own committees"" to take over the redistricting process. H.R. 1 would overhaul how congressional redistricting would work in the states that do not already have independent redistricting commissions. States currently without one would have to appoint a 15-member panel composed of equal numbers of Democrats, Republicans and independents. The law also says, broadly, that lines should not be drawn for partisan gain and that communities, if possible, should not be divided. However, the bill says states — not the federal government — would choose the commissioners and equip them for the task. These panels would not become the federal government’s ""own committees"" handling redistricting.  We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/apr/02/turning-point-usa/video-gives-inaccurate-reading-redistricting-overh/

COVID-19 vaccines did not cause a 366% increase in miscarriages, as article claims

The article’s headline, which is circulating as an image in social media posts in the U.S., reads: ""Number of women to lose their unborn child after having the COVID vaccine increases by 366% in just six weeks."" The article says that the miscarriages came ""as a result of the mothers receiving one of the COVID-19 vaccines."" This is misleading and inaccurate. First, the image does not indicate that the figures the article cites come from the U.K., not the U.S., even though the widely circulated version of the post we found included the Instagram handle @antimaskNYC, an account that also shared the post.  Second, U.K. health officials said the article takes the numbers out of context, as it doesn’t account for the increase in vaccination rates over time, or the average number of miscarriages that occur naturally. Lastly, there is no evidence of a causal link between miscarriages and COVID-19 vaccines. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The story references data from the U.K.’s Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency’s Yellow Card scheme. The reporting system releases weekly reports and monitors possible side effects of vaccines, similar to the VAERS system maintained by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. ""Just six weeks separate the first and seventh report, and the shocking increase in the number of women losing their unborn and newborn child in that time due to having either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca Covid vaccine is appalling,"" the article says. It claims that between Dec. 9, 2020, and Jan. 24, 2021, a total of six women had a miscarriage ""as a direct result"" of receiving one of the COVID-19 vaccines. The story then says there were 22 more reports of miscarriages from Jan. 24 through March 7, bringing the total to 28 — a rise of about 366.6%.  But the article fails to consider how many people were vaccinated during these time periods, and it overlooks the average number of naturally occurring miscarriages in the U.K. What’s more, no causal link between the two has been established: reports that these incidents occurred after vaccination are not confirmation that they resulted from a vaccine.   When asked about the claim, the U.K. regulator, known as MHRA, told PolitiFact that there is ""no pattern"" to suggest an elevated risk of miscarriage related to the COVID-19 vaccines. ""The number of Yellow Card reports for any suspected reaction should not be compared from one period to another or between vaccines, as this takes no account of any differences in the extent or patterns of usage between the time periods,"" the agency said. In the Dec. 9 to Jan. 24 time period when six miscarriages were reported to Yellow Card, there were roughly 7.1 million people who had been vaccinated. By March 7, the number vaccinated jumped to 22.7 million. That means that, in the later period when 22 miscarriages were reported, 15.6 million more people had been vaccinated. Based on those raw numbers, the rates of people reporting miscarriages in both periods are closer —  0.000084% in the early group compared with 0.000141% in the later group, which included more than three times as many women of child-bearing age. MHRA noted that the number of people ages 18 to 45 who received a first dose increased from 1.3 million to 4.3 million in the same time frame — and with half of these expected to be women — the number of women of child-bearing age who were vaccinated is estimated to have increased 223% from 665,524 to 2,146,866. ""Sadly, miscarriage is estimated to occur in about 1 in 4 pregnancies (equal to 25 in 100) in the U.K. (outside of the pandemic), and most occur in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, so some miscarriages would be expected to occur following vaccination purely by chance,"" the agency wrote. ""The MHRA has received a small number of reports of miscarriage following vaccine exposure in first 12 weeks of pregnancy, which we are closely monitoring. There is currently no pattern to suggest an elevated risk of miscarriage related to exposure to the COVID-19 vaccines in pregnancy."" According to the Mayo Clinic, miscarriage ""is a relatively common experience"" and occurs in about 10% to 20% of known pregnancies, with the rate increasing with age. Many reproductive health experts say the true number is likely much higher.  The Daily Expose article also claimed that one stillbirth occurred following an AstraZeneca vaccination, which the MHRA disputed. The agency said some reports of events related to pregnancy later turn out to be incorrect and that ""no actual stillbirths"" have been reported so far. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the CDC have reached similar conclusions, saying that there is no evidence to date that the shots cause any problems in pregnancy. But they caution that data is still limited. The agencies are using safety monitoring systems like VAERS to collect more information and hope to have more robust results in the coming months. The U.K. government, however, does not routinely recommend the COVID-19 vaccines for pregnant women. Officials there acknowledge that available data hasn’t raised any safety concerns, but they say it’s still too limited to recommend the shots to all pregnant women.  The MHRA added that the potential benefits of vaccination may be important for those who are at high risk of getting infected, or those with clinical conditions that put them at high risk of suffering serious complications from COVID-19.  The CDC, as well as many reproductive health organizations, says the vaccines should be offered to eligible pregnant and breastfeeding women, and recommend that they (and those who plan to become pregnant) talk to their doctors to weigh the risks and benefits. A claim circulating online claims that the number of pregnant women who have miscarried increased by ""366% in just six weeks"" as a result of receiving a COVID-19 vaccine. This statement takes data out of context and presents an unfounded conclusion. Health officials in the U.K. say that there is currently no evidence of an increase in miscarriages after COVID-19 immunization. The article on which the claim is based misrepresents figures from the country’s vaccine reporting system, and officials say it doesn’t account for the increased vaccination rate over time, or the country’s average rate of miscarriages. Nor is there any evidence that has shown a causal link between the vaccine and miscarriages. We rate this False. ",/factchecks/2021/apr/02/blog-posting/covid-19-vaccines-did-not-cause-366-increase-misca/

Mich. GOP’s proposed election law changes would make it harder to vote
","Republicans in Michigan’s Senate recently unveiled a massive package of proposed changes to election laws that they say will improve voting security and integrity, and boost voters’ confidence in the election process. They’ve also pitched their reforms as expanding voting access. ""This package is designed to make it easier for people to vote and ensure our elections are conducted fairly and honestly,"" state Sen. Michael MacDonald claimed in a statement, echoing similar claims from other Republican lawmakers. Voting rights advocates and election officials from both parties disagree. They point to bills that would impose stricter voter ID requirements — including a new one for absentee voters — shorten the deadline for returning absentee ballots via drop boxes, prohibit clerks from paying for postage on absentee ballot return envelopes, and restrict the secretary of state’s ability to make absentee ballot applications available to voters. Senate Republicans, for their part, cite other measures that would establish an early in-person voting day, enable some teenagers to pre-register to vote and allow some members of the military to electronically submit their ballots. Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey and Sen. Ruth Johnson, a former secretary of state who chairs the Senate Elections Committee, have pointed to these changes in claiming the package would make it ""easier to vote."" Ottawa County Clerk Justin Roebuck, a Republican who co-chairs the Michigan Association of County Clerks’ legislative committee, said he wouldn’t characterize the package as improving voters’ experience. ""I don’t think there’s any way that you can claim that taken as a whole, it would make voting easier,"" he said. PolitiFact Michigan took a look at the proposed changes and their potential impact on voters, especially absentee voters, who made up a majority in the 2020 general election. We found that on balance, the changes would make it harder — not easier — to vote. MacDonald didn’t respond to a request for an interview.  The Republican legislative push comes after a November 2020 election that saw a record 5.5 million votes cast in Michigan, including more than 3.3 million absentee ballots. More Michiganders have had access to absentee ballots since 2018, when voters overwhelmingly approved a constitutional amendment to give every voter the right to vote absentee for any reason. ""Millions of Michiganders used that right last year and will certainly want and seek to use it in the future,"" said Sharon Dolente, a voting rights attorney and senior adviser for Promote the Vote MI. The GOP bills would make it harder for those voters, she said. And with the proposed voter ID requirement for in-person voting, ""one could argue that it is imposing burdens on every single registered voter whether they choose to vote absentee or on Election Day."" Four bills propose major changes to the current process for absentee voting. One bill would require voters to attach a paper copy of their ID to their application for an absentee ballot. That places a burden on voters by requiring them to own or have access to a copier or printer. The bill would allow voters requesting an absentee ballot to present their ID or a copy in person to their local clerk. Under Michigan’s constitution, voters have the right to choose whether to apply for an absentee ballot in person or by mail. The ID requirement could interfere with that choice. ""If you are requiring an individual to come in person to show their ID, you have ostensibly eliminated their opportunity to utilize the mail unless they have the financial means to have a printer, paper, ink,"" Dolente said. Voters who don’t show their ID with their ballot application would be issued a provisional ballot. Under the Senate Republican plan, they would have to verify their identify within six days of an election in order for their vote to count. That could lead to a higher rejection rate of absentee ballots. Another bill would bar voters from returning absentee ballots via a drop box after 5 p.m. the day before an election; clerks would have to lock it at that time. Under current law, voters have until 8 p.m. on Election Day, which is when polls close statewide. Ingham County Clerk Barb Byrum, a Democrat who co-chairs the legislative committee with Roebuck, said that having a separate deadline for returning absentee ballots via a drop box ""is throwing up more walls between the voter and the ballot box."" And Dolente said it could end up excluding them. ""I could see voters showing up after 5 p.m. not knowing the deadline … on their way home from work with their ballots and then potentially not ever coming back again."" Senate Republicans also propose barring local clerks from providing prepaid postage on return envelopes for absentee ballots, and barring the secretary of state from funding prepaid postage. Voters would have to add and pay for postage themselves. During the November 2020 election, 183 clerks across Michigan requested reimbursement to cover prepaid postage for 977,705 absentee ballot return envelopes, according to the secretary of state’s office. Senate Republicans also introduced a bill that would prohibit two steps that Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson took in 2020 to encourage absentee voting amid the pandemic: mailing absentee ballot applications to all registered voters, and providing an online application on the Department of State’s website. Dolente said that the mailing of applications ""made sure that everybody knew about their right"" to vote absentee ""and had the means to exercise that right."" And nearly 400,000 voters in the November election submitted applications through the Department of State’s website, according to the secretary of state’s office. Without an application on that site, voters would have to turn to their local clerk’s website, which might not post the application, Dolente said. Voting rights advocates have also expressed concern over a bill that would ramp up identification requirements for in-person voting. Currently, Michigan voters who don’t have an ID with them vote can sign an affidavit attesting to their identity and vote normally. The bill would require that these voters be issued provisional ballots instead. Abby Walls, who handles communications for the Michigan Senate Republican caucus, denied that the package would limit absentee ballot access and pointed to other bills in the package to support Republicans’ claims that they would make it ""easier for people to vote."" One bill would allow teens as young as 16 to pre-register to vote if they’ve been issued a drivers license or state ID. The package also includes a bill that would allow active-duty service members deployed at the time of an election to cast a ballot electronically. These measures would impact a subset of the voting population. One bill would create a single day of early in-person voting on a Saturday two weeks before Election Day. Many states offer a much longer early voting window, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Byrum said these measures don’t offset the proposals that would make voting harder for millions of voters. ""Any time… a package of legislation disenfranchises one voter, that cannot be negated by decent legislation or decent portions of a bill."" Roebuck said the onus rests on Republican lawmakers to show why changes he said would make voting harder are necessary. ""If we have a massive amount of absentee ballot fraud due to people receiving applications or due to people having their postage paid … We have to deal with that. So then prove to me where that is because I want to see that before I can get behind legislation that would negatively impact my voters."" Walls did not respond to a request for evidence of significant voter fraud that would explain the changes to postage and ballot application rules. MacDonald claimed that Senate Republicans’ election bills are ""designed to make it easier for people to vote."" While the package contains some measures that expand voting access, it includes more substantial changes that would make it harder to vote in Michigan for many people.

No, this year’s tax deadline is NOT April 18
","It’s April Fools’ Day, and many of us are probably on the lookout for the usual funny business. But a Facebook post warning of a looming tax deadline has some people legitimately wondering whether it’s for real. The post is a cartoon-style picture of a character saying, ""The tax deadline is April 18th. Do your taxes soon.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Many have responded to the post to say that’s the wrong date — and it is wrong — but some are still confused about when taxes are due. We looked into it to help make sure you don’t get fooled, or miss an important deadline. The post actually dates back to March 29, 2018, the first clue that it’s not to be taken seriously. But the April 18 deadline would have been incorrect for that year, too, according to the Internal Revenue Service.  In an announcement published in January 2018, the IRS said its deadline for tax returns that year was April 17, two days later than usual.  The traditional deadline to file is April 15, unless a legal holiday in Washington, D.C. pushes that date back. In 2018, April 15 fell on a Sunday, and the following day was Emancipation Day in D.C., which pushed the deadline back to Tuesday, April 17. For this year, the IRS pushed the filing deadline back to May 17, because of the pandemic. The deadline was delayed for the pandemic in 2020 also. ""This continues to be a tough time for many people, and the IRS wants to continue to do everything possible to help taxpayers navigate the unusual circumstances related to the pandemic, while also working on important tax administration responsibilities,"" IRS Commissioner Chuck Rettig explained in a statement.  Rettig urged people to file as soon as possible, ""especially those who are owed refunds."" Filing online and arranging for direct deposit is the quickest way to get those refunds, he said. The IRS said individual taxpayers can also postpone their federal income tax payments until May 17, without facing penalties or interest, regardless of how much is owed. After that date, penalties and interest will begin to accrue on any unpaid balance.  Taxpayers in Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana have even more time. Because of a federal disaster-area declaration following the winter storms there, the IRS moved the deadline for these three states to June 15. This deadline applies to filing individual and business tax returns and making tax payments.  A 2018 Facebook post that’s recirculating now said the tax deadline is April 18. That wasn’t true for 2018, and it’s not true for this year either. This year’s deadline for most taxpayers was moved to May 17 because of the pandemic.

The COVID-19 vaccine is not an ‘operating system’ run by Bill Gates
","The technology behind two coronavirus vaccines approved for emergency use in the U.S. is actually an operating system aimed at programming humans. The programmer? Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates. That’s not the plot of a science fiction movie — it’s a bogus conspiracy theory in a video seen more than 48,000 times on Facebook. ""The new so-called experimental vaccine, what’s new about it? The real new and amazing thing about it is that it’s not even a vaccine — mRNA is not a vaccine,"" a man says in the March 31 video, which includes other anti-vaccine claims. ""The CEO of Moderna boasts about the fact that the mRNA vaccine is actually an operating system, such as you would put in your computer."" ""And of course who’s the great programmer who has bestowed upon himself the title of the grand programmer of humanity? Well it’s Bill Gates himself."" (Screenshot from Facebook) The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It was originally posted on the Instagram page of Damon Jones, a personal development coach who did not respond to our request for comment. The video is ridiculously wrong. COVID-19 vaccines help prevent the spread of the coronavirus — they are not part of a Gates-run plot to program humans. mRNA stands for messenger RNA. Most vaccines put weakened or inactivated germs in the body to activate an immune response, but mRNA vaccines don’t. Instead, they tell human cells how to make the spike protein that’s present on coronavirus virions. That protein trains the body’s immune system to create antibodies, which can prevent future COVID-19 infection. Vaccines from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna use mRNA to inoculate people against the coronavirus. On its website, Moderna likens the technology to an ""operating system on a computer."" ""It is designed so that it can plug and play interchangeably with different programs,"" the company says. ""In our case, the ‘program’ or ‘app’ is our mRNA drug — the unique mRNA sequence that codes for a protein."" That’s a metaphor — mRNA vaccines aren’t literally operating systems.  The instructions contained in mRNA vaccines degrade quickly once they’re inside immune cells. We’ve previously debunked claims that mRNA vaccines alter people’s DNA and control them.

No, it’s not safer to skip the COVID-19 vaccine to avoid permanent side effects
","One argument for not getting a coronavirus vaccination goes like this: Even if you get vaccinated, it’s possible to get COVID-19; the vaccines can have ""permanent"" side effects; so, it’s safer not to get vaccinated.  The argument is made in a post widely shared on Instagram that says: ""If I don’t take the vaccine, I’m at risk for covid. If I do take the vaccine, I’m still at risk for covid PLUS I’m at risk for permanent vaccine side effects. Therefore I’m reducing my risk by not taking the vaccine. That’s the real science.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) What the science shows is vaccines dramatically reduce the chances of getting COVID-19. And if you do contract COVID-19 even after a vaccine, you’re less likely to get seriously sick, thanks to the work of the vaccine. As for permanent side effects, this is an area still being studied. But as one virologist put it, the risk ""is extremely low to the point of being almost impossible to measure."" The Food and Drug Administration has granted emergency use authorization to three coronavirus vaccines: one from Pfizer-BioNTech, one from Moderna, and one from Johnson & Johnson. They were authorized following clinical trials that lasted months and included tens of thousands of participants. The FDA found ""no specific safety concerns"" associated with any of the three vaccines.  According to the private Mayo Clinic, based in Rochester, Minn., the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine is 95% effective in preventing the COVID-19 virus with symptoms; the rate for Moderna is 94% and for Johnson & Johnson, 66%, based on clinical trials. A federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study published March 29 found that the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines reduce risk of infection by 90% after the full course of two shots and by 80% two weeks after the first shot. The study was done under ""real-world conditions"": 3,950 health care personnel, first responders, and other essential and frontline workers were tested for 13 consecutive weeks. A study published Feb. 24 in the New England Journal of Medicine found that two doses of the Pfizer vaccine provided nearly 90% protection. That study, in Israel, compared 596,618 unvaccinated people with 596,618 people who were vaccinated. Some people who are fully vaccinated against COVID-19 will still get infected — but based on clinical studies, the vaccine can keep them from getting seriously ill, according to the CDC. Vaccinations are widely recommended because, even though many people with COVID-19 have only a mild illness, others may get a severe illness, have long-term health effects or die — and there is no way to know how COVID-19 will affect you, even if you don’t have an increased risk of developing severe complications, the CDC says. Because clinical trials started in the summer of 2020, it’s not yet clear if the COVID-19 vaccines could result in some long-term side effects, but vaccines rarely cause long-term side effects, the Mayo Clinic says. Although data on side effects ""is still emerging, and the CDC is tracking this in the U.S., the risk of permanent side effects is extremely low to the point of being almost impossible to measure,"" said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Center for Global Health Science and Security at Georgetown University Medical Center. ""There is no significant risk of permanent injury with any of the vaccines available in the U.S."" Most cases of severe, systemic adverse events from any of the COVID-19 vaccines currently authorized in the U.S are anaphylactic shock, a severe allergic reaction that occurs in about 1 in 1 million cases, Rasmussen said. It does not cause long-term permanent injury if treated promptly, she said. ""There really have been little to no reports of permanent side effects, conclusively attributed to the vaccines, to date,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-disease specialist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins University Center for Health Security. More than 145 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the U.S. from Dec. 14, 2020, through March 29. Among them, 2,509 deaths were reported (0.0017%). According to the CDC, reviews by physicians from the CDC and the FDA ""revealed no evidence that vaccination contributed to patient deaths."" A widely shared Instagram post stated: ""If I don’t take the vaccine, I’m at risk for covid. If I do take the vaccine, I’m still at risk for covid PLUS I’m at risk for permanent vaccine side effects. Therefore I’m reducing my risk by not taking the vaccine. That’s the real science."" Science shows that the three COVID-19 vaccines authorized in the U.S. reduce the likelihood of infection by 66% to 95% — and make it less likely that you’ll get seriously ill if you do contract COVID-19 after being vaccinated.

Instagram post overlooks FDA sign-off on COVID-19 vaccines
","An Instagram post from a Tampa Bay nurse casts doubt on the value of the COVID-19 vaccines. ""So, you injected the non-FDA-approved experimental agent, but you still have to wear a mask and social distance?"" the March 30 post asks. ""Does that imply the jab, the mask and the social distancing don’t work? #sodumb"" Here, we check the claim that any of the COVID-19 vaccines rely on a ""non-FDA-approved experimental agent."" FDA is the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The claim’s main flaw is it fails to reflect that the FDA authorized the vaccines after months of clinical testing. In a public health emergency, there’s a defined process to expedite the use of promising drugs. The rationale is that during a crisis that poses an immediate threat to peoples’ lives, it is unethical to stick with the conventional approval process. The new drugs must be fully tested in clinical trials involving tens of thousands of participants. Drug makers have to submit reports on the outcomes and effects on every participant. The chemistry behind the drug, details of the manufacturing process, and the details of the quality controls in place are also required. The data has to show that the drug is both safe and effective. The FDA issued emergency use authorizations for the Pfizer, Moderna and Johnson and Johnson vaccines. While that falls short of a final approval, Northwestern University professor of medical ethics Seema Shah said that’s a distinction with little difference. ""An emergency use authorization has a slightly lower bar to cross than full approval, but has come about after a comprehensive review of the data,"" Shah said. ""Most of the steps cut out by the FDA have to do more with paperwork than with stringency of review."" Drug makers must continue to monitor and report any negative outcomes that follow vaccination. That ongoing process underlies the dispute over how to describe the vaccines. While vaccine skeptics often use the term ""experimental agent"" when referring to the vaccines, the FDA refers to the drugs as ""investigational vaccines."" The agency’s authorization letters tell drug makers to file ""periodic safety reports at monthly intervals"" under an ""investigational new drug"" tracking system. The manner in which the words are applied ""is linked to interpretation,"" said Ross Upshur, head of the Division of Clinical Public Health at the Dalla Lana School of Public Health in Toronto. ""Experimental agent"" emphasizes uncertainty. ""Investigational"" links back to the clinical trials that preceded the emergency authorization. The nurse behind the post, Erin Marie Olszewski, has appeared on the conservative networks Fox News and One America News. We emailed her through her website and did not hear back. An Instagram post described the COVID-19 vaccine as a ""non-FDA-approved experimental agent."" While the vaccines await full FDA approval, the FDA formally authorized their use after reviewing months of data involving tens of thousands of clinical trial participants. Experts in medical ethics said there’s little difference between the trial results that lead to emergency use authorization and final approval. Evaluation of the vaccines continues and drug makers must file monthly reports on any adverse outcomes.

Fact-checking Jon Stewart's last Daily Show interview with Barack Obama
","President Barack Obama thanked retiring Daily Show host Jon Stewart for being a ""great gift to the country"" in the commander in chief’s seventh and final appearance on the show with Stewart as its leader. ""I can’t believe that you’re leaving before me,"" Obama said, adding that he would be issuing a new executive order that Stewart cannot leave. When the laughs died down, Stewart tried to press Obama for serious answers about the Iran nuclear deal and Middle East relations.   ""Let me ask you a question about Iran. Whose team are we on in the Middle East?"" Stewart said. ""So we're fighting with Iraqis to defeat ISIS along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran with Iraqis and Saudis."" ""That’s not quite right,"" Obama laughed, ""but that’s okay."" Obama went on to call Iran an anti-American, anti-Israel, anti-Semitic adversary that sponsors terrorist organizations, but he never said what wasn’t quite right about the relationships that Stewart described. We wanted to fact-check Stewart on the United States’ complicated ties in the Middle East. Was Stewart right in saying that Iran was a U.S. ally against ISIS and an enemy in Yemen? U.S. and Iran against ISIS While both the United States and Iran are fighting against ISIS, they are not cooperating or fighting as allies. Iran is not included as part of the 60-member coalition the United States has assembled to fight ISIS. Stewart overstated the Iran-U.S. relationship, said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation. Even though the United States and Iran are on the same side in fighting ISIS, the nations are not allies. Iran wants more influence in the area than the United States wants it to have. ""Iran has the longstanding goal of establishing itself as a prominent power in the region,"" Brennan said. Iran wants a ""weak and stable"" Iraq that will acquiesce to Iran’s goals. Iran’s support of certain Shia militias in Iraq is also a reason that the United States has ""expressed concerns about Iran’s role in Iraq,"" said Alistair Baskey, White House National Security Council spokesman. Shia militias often target Iraqi Sunnis (and vice-versa) in a conflict that dates back centuries. So even though the Shia militias are part of a broader front against ISIS, Brennan said they are still the same people responsible for killing Americans in previous conflicts. One example is Abu Mohandis (also known as Jamal Jafaar Mohammed), the current leader of the Popular Mobilization Forces (the sum total of all Shia militias in Iraq) who was responsible for the 1983 bombings of the U.S. and French embassies in Kuwait. He acted in the capacity of an ""Iranian agent in Iraq"" according to a 2007 CNN article. Another reason why the United States refuses to openly support or work as an official ally of Iran: It is a staunch supporter of Syria’s Bashar al-Assad. The United States opposes Assad’s regime and has called for Assad to ""step aside"" multiple times as the government brutally cracked down on its people, including the regime’s chemical weapon attacks on Syrian citizens dating back to 2012. The battle in Yemen Now for the other arrangement Stewart described: Is the U.S. fighting against Iran in Yemen? Not directly. The United States continues to ""provide logistical and intelligence support"" to a Saudi Arabia-led coalition of the Gulf Cooperation Council fighting the Houthi militia in Yemen, Baskey said. The coalition includes Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Qatar. (Oman is not a member of the coalition, although it is a member of the GCC.) The Houthi militia forces have rallied against Yemen’s president, Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi, who took office in 2012 but was forced to resign by Houthi rebels in January 2015. (On Feb. 6, 2015, Houthi rebels announced Mohammed Ali al-Houthi as the president of their Revolutionary Committee). Analysts said Iran is suspected of arming, training and equipping Houthi militia. According to a Defense News article, the United States was ""monitoring"" Iranian ships that may have been delivering weapons to Houthi military. The Iranian government has officially denied helping Houthi forces, according to a BBC article. However, neither Iran nor the United States is doing the actual fighting in Yemen. "" ‘We’ are not fighting in Yemen – though U.S. Special Forces may be involved,"" said Theodore R. Bromund, a senior research fellow at the Davis Institute for National Security and Foreign Policy at the Heritage Foundation. ""It is the Saudis who are doing the fighting."" Several experts also pointed out that Stewart was wrong about Iraq’s participation in Yemen. ""We are not aware of any Iraqi involvement in the Yemen conflict,"" Baskey confirmed. Our ruling Stewart said the United States is ""fighting with Iraqis to defeat ISIS along with Iran. But in Yemen we're fighting Iran with Iraqis and Saudis."" As Obama pointed out, Stewart's claim is off on a few points — Iran is not an official ally of the United States against ISIS even though both countries are fighting the terrorist group; the United States is not directly fighting Iran in Yemen; and Iraqi soldiers are not involved in the Yemen conflict.

Donald Trump: Guantanamo prisoners swapped for Bowe Bergdahl are 'back on the battlefield'
","Donald Trump says you can tell that America’s current leaders are the only people in the country who haven’t read his book, The Art of the Deal, because they make such bad deals. At a campaign rally in South Carolina July 21, 2015, Trump, the wealthy businessman-turned-Republican presidential candidate, called out the White House for making deals he disagrees with. One he cited specifically was the controversial decision to exchange five Guantanamo detainees for Taliban prisoner Army Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl in May 2014. Bergdahl has since been charged by the military with desertion and misbehaving before the enemy. ""We get a traitor, a no-good, rotten traitor like Bergdahl,"" Trump said. ""And they get five killers that they most wanted in the whole world, who are right now back on the battlefield, trying to kill everybody, including us. Okay? What kind of a deal is this?"" Are the five former detainees -- who were senior Taliban operatives -- now ""back on the battlefield"" and re-engaged in terrorism? We decided to take a closer look. In September 2014, we gave a Pants on Fire rating to a claim that ""Three of five detainees swapped (for Bergdahl) are now ISIS leaders."" Has something changed since then? Best as we can tell, no. The five detainees (sometimes called the Taliban Five) were released to the Persian Gulf nation of Qatar. Qatar is understood to be a neutral state, as opposed to a ""battlefield"" for insurgent activity. Under the agreement, the five released detainees are not allowed to leave the country. This travel ban was initially supposed to last one year, ending June 1, 2015, but it has been extended. Multiple administration officials and experts told us the Taliban Five haven’t left Qatar, and we couldn’t find any evidence to the contrary. ""They’re all still in Qatar,"" said Myles Caggins, a spokesman for the National Security Council. The United States and Qatar are working together to keep tabs on the Taliban Five. Caggins declined to comment on specific security and surveillance arrangements. But he said ""the State Department is in continual discussion with the government of Qatar"" regarding the former detainees. Another barrier to the ex-detainees’ return to the battlefield is an additional travel ban beyond the U.S.-Qatar agreement. Four of the five are restricted from leaving the country due to a travel ban imposed by a 1998 United Nations Security Council Resolution, said Barnett Rubin, associate director of the Center on International Cooperation at New York University. Of course, this doesn’t necessarily mean the former detainees aren’t trying to reconnect with the Taliban or other insurgent groups. At least one of the Taliban Five is suspected by the United States of having attempted to contact Taliban associates. And Afghan intelligence officers arrested two suspected insurgents who tried to visit former detainee Mohammad Nabi Omari in Qatar, according to the New York Times. It’s also possible that some or all of the Taliban Five have had more contact with the Taliban or other jihadist networks without the public (or even the government) knowing, said Daveed Gartenstein-Ross, senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. But mere communications, or even giving orders from a distance, is not the same thing as literally being ""back on the battlefield."" ""There are indications that they would like to return to the battlefield,"" Gartenstein-Ross said. ""There’s reason for concern, but there’s not evidence to support (Trump’s) particular claim."" Even if the Taliban Five has re-engaged in insurgent activities electronically -- a contention that, we reiterate, is not confirmed by any publicly available information -- it would be a stretch to conclude that this counts as returning to the battlefield. ""At least one of them called some of his relatives. I don't know what he said on the phone. If making a phone call now constitutes returning to the battlefield, we are in 1984 territory,"" Rubin said, referring to the George Orwell novel. Our ruling Donald Trump said the five Guantanamo detainees swapped for Bowe Bergdahl ""are right now back on the battlefield."" The Taliban Five are known to be in Qatar, where they have been since their release over a year ago. Qatar is considered neutral ground -- not a battlefield -- and they are not allowed to leave the country. At least one of the five has been in contact with suspected insurgents, but experts said there is not enough information available to know the extent of these communications. And even if they had communicated with insurgents from afar, that would not the same as literally going back to the battlefield. Because there is no evidence to support Trump’s claim, we rate it False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/23/donald-trump/trump-guantanamo-prisoners-swapped-bowe-bergdahl-a/
"['New Hampshire', 'Deficit', 'Population', 'States', 'Kelly  Ayotte']","
Ayotte says deficit could pay for 40 gallons of New Hampshire maple syrup for everyone in the U.S.
","During a town hall on July 1, 2015,  in Colebrook, N.H., U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte used a regional example to explain the size of the federal deficit. She said the deficit -- some $483 billion last year -- would buy 40 gallons of maple syrup for every man, woman and child in the United States. Ayotte has used that example before, including a January town meeting in Goffstown. And she has used other colorful examples to illustrate the size of our nation’s deficit, telling voters in 2013 that it could pay ""all of the 2013 salaries of every professional baseball player for the next 248 years."" (That was True, by the way.) But what about the maple syrup comparison? Would $483 billion cover that 40 gallons for every U.S. resident? PolitiFact decided to check the math. This is a story of three numbers. The first is the U.S. budget deficit, which can easily be found in information from the official Congressional Budget Office. The deficit is the amount that the country runs short each year -- the difference between its income and expenses -- and shouldn’t be confused with the national debt, which is much larger because it’s the cumulative total of all past deficits, minus surpluses. The office’s report from January puts the 2014 deficit at $483 billion. The second number is the population of the United States. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, which keeps close track of such things, the nation had 320 million people by the end of 2014. (It’s added 1.3 million since then.) Dividing those two numbers, then, means that each person in the country has $1,509.40 of our nation’s deficit. That then leads to our third number: the price of maple syrup. How much of the flapjack topping could $1,509.40 buy? Fortunately, the U.S. Department of Agriculture tracks maple syrup prices, through its National Agriculture Statistics Service. It issued a bunch of numbers last month that can help us out. According those numbers, the average price of a gallon of maple syrup in New Hampshire in 2014 -- the same year as our $483 billion deficit and our 320 million population -- was $57.80. That generally tracks with local farm prices. When we checked, Corlis Farm in Northfield was charging $55 a gallon. Maple Ridge Sugar House in Loudon was charging $58 per gallon. And last year, Sunnyside Maples in Gilmanton was charging $55 for a gallon. The USDA figure was backed up by the New Hampshire Maple Producers Association. According to association publicist Robyn Pearl, it’s not going to go down anytime soon. ""The price has been on a slow yet steady increase over the years, which reflects the same increase in production costs,"" Pearl said. If we use that $57.80 average, Ayotte’s claim gets, well, a little sticky. That $1,509.40 per U.S. resident would only buy a bit more than 26 gallons of syrup, not 40. We checked with Ayotte’s office to see what figures they were using. They referred us to the same set of statistics on maple prices -- from a year earlier -- but pointed to different numbers. They used the U.S. average price per gallon, which was $37.40 for 2013, and the New Hampshire wholesale price for syrup, which was $37.90 per gallon in 2012 and $46.10 per gallon in 2013. Using that national average price per gallon indeed yields 40 gallons of syrup per person, but Ayotte’s office confirmed she was talking about New Hampshire made maple syrup. Looking just at the New Hampshire numbers, the 2012 wholesale price for a gallon of syrup comes close, although the 2013 wholesale price yields only 32.8 gallons per person. (The 2014 wholesale price, which wasn’t cited by Ayotte’s staff, is $42.40 per gallon, which would given each person 35.6 gallons.) But those at Ayotte’s town hall meeting know they're not paying wholesale prices at their local sugar house, where gallons of syrup are going for well over $50. There’s a broader point here, of course. The senator’s statement was meant to give residents a handle on an otherwise incomprehensible figure -- the size of the U.S. budget deficit. That’s what Ayotte’s staff said she hoped to do. Just for fun, we decided to calculate how long 40 gallons of syrup would last the average American. While some of us in the Northeast might consume a gallon or more a year (don’t tell the dentist), the national average is between 2.5 to 4 ounces per person, according to the Agricultural Marketing Resource Center and Center for Northern Woodlands Education. In other words, 40 gallons of syrup should last the average American more than 160 years. And never mind the fact that giving that much syrup to everyone in the United States would be a sticky situation. New Hampshire only made 112,000 gallons of syrup in 2014, and there were only 3.2 million gallons produced in the United States that year; enough to give one gallon to every 100 people. In the words of Warner syrup producer Barbara Lassonde, ""We don't make that much, and if we tapped every maple tree in the Northeastern quadrant of the country, I still don't believe we'd make enough."" Our ruling U.S. Sen. Kelly Ayotte said the federal budget deficit is big enough to be able to buy 40 gallons of maple syrup for every resident of the United States. Ayotte’s office said she was calculating it based on generic U.S.-made syrup, but that’s considerably less expensive than New Hampshire-made syrup. If we were buying New Hampshire syrup wholesale using 2014 prices, the amount would come closer, but still not hit a full 40 gallons. And if we use retail costs in New Hampshire, it works out to 26 gallons, not 40. So her numbers are open to question, but her general point is valid: Either figure represents more than a lifetime supply for the average maple muncher in America.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Military', 'Nuclear', 'Tom Cotton']","
Was Obama's goal 'at the beginning of the negotiations' to 'dismantle Iran's nuclear program'?
","In the wake of the newly completed Iran nuclear agreement, a number of Republicans have charged that the Obama administration has struck a deal that they see as dangerous and inadequate. Among them is freshman Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., a frequent critic of Obama’s foreign policy. In an appearance on CNN on July 15, Cotton lamented what he saw as a weak agreement: ""He (Obama) said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran's nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. In fact, we are going to keep Iran's nuclear program in place. In fact, Western countries are going to help Iran develop advanced capabilities."" We decided to check the claim that the administration’s original intent was to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions. Which nuclear program? Since Iran has long asserted that it has a right to pursue nuclear energy -- as distinct from nuclear weapons -- a key question for us was whether the term ""nuclear program"" referred narrowly to nuclear weapons or more broadly to any kind of nuclear research, including nuclear energy. It’s easy to see how a speaker could say ""nuclear program"" when they actually intended to say ""nuclear weapons program."" The answer, according to Cotton’s staff, is that the senator was referring to the nuclear program as a whole, not simply the weapons program. Cotton’s staff also pointed PolitiFact to some quotes from Obama’s 2012 presidential debate against Mitt Romney to back up their claim. In the debate, Obama boasted of the success of sanctions in paving a way forward for negotiations: ""The work that we’ve done with respect to sanctions now offers Iran a choice. They can take the diplomatic route and end their nuclear program or they will have to face a united world and a United States president, me, who said we’re not going to take any options off the table,"" he said. He alluded to Iran either giving up or ending their nuclear program — he didn’t specify that he was referring to the Iranian nuclear weapons program — two more times during the debate. However, this wouldn’t have been, as Cotton said, ""at the beginning of negotiations"" -- the first meeting between Secretary of State John Kerry and his Iranian counterparts was held on Sept. 26, 2013. (Here's a detailed timeline.) So we decided to see if we could find some stronger evidence. As it happens, a pro-Israel group, the Israel Project, also made a statement much like Cotton’s, and a spokeswoman pointed us to several pieces of evidence.   One is a remark by Kerry before the House Foreign Affairs Committee on Dec. 10, 2013, right around the time negotiations were kicking into gear. ""But I don’t think that any of us thought we were just imposing these sanctions for the sake of imposing them. We did it because we knew that it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the regime."" Upon examining the full context of Kerry’s speech, however, it becomes clear that Kerry was not referring to the strategy of the White House, but rather to his own time in the Senate, and he seems to reflect the mind-set he and his fellow senators had toward sanctions. ""I will tell you that in my 29 years, just about shy of the full 29 I’ve served in the Senate, I was always a leading proponent of the sanctions against Iran. I’m proud of what we did here. But it was undeniable that the pressure we put on Iran through these sanctions is exactly what has brought Iran to the table today, and I think Congress deserves an enormous amount of credit for that,"" said Kerry. Only then does he add, ""But I don’t think that any of us thought we were just imposing these sanctions for the sake of imposing them. We did it because we knew that it would hopefully help Iran dismantle its nuclear program. That was the whole point of the regime."" The Israel Project also pointed us to a comment by Wendy Sherman, the under secretary of state for political affairs, during a PBS interview on Dec. 4, 2013. Asked whether a comprehensive agreement will ""include dismantling, full dismantling,"" Sherman replied, ""This includes a lot of dismantling of their infrastructure … At the end of the day, what is critical here is that the international community and the United States of America must have full confidence that Iran truly has a peaceful program."" But Sherman’s statement refers to ""a lot of dismantling,"" which is short of a full dismantling. Contrary evidence Perhaps the most definitive refutation of Cotton’s claim comes from Obama himself, in an appearance on Dec. 7, 2013, at a Middle East policy forum -- again, right around when the negotiations were starting. ""If we could create an option in which Iran eliminated every single nut and bolt of their nuclear program and forswore the possibility of ever having a nuclear program, and for that matter got rid of all its military capabilities, I would take it. But I want to make sure everybody understands it — that particular option is not available. So as a consequence, what we have to do is make a decision as to, given the options available, what is the best way for us to (ensure) Iran does not get a nuclear weapon?"" This suggests that the Obama administration was focused not on completely eliminating the Iranian nuclear program, but rather on blocking the pathway to a nuclear weapon. ""It has not been the goal of the George W. Bush administration or the Obama administration to completely dismantle every aspect of their nuclear program,"" said Daryl Kimball, executive director of the Arms Control Association, a group that aims to educate the public on arms control policy. He added, ""Look at the context — (the U.S.) goal is to dismantle, curtail, reduce, to the point (Iran) cannot acquire a nuclear weapon. Nobody is arguing about completely eliminating the nuclear program."" The time element of Cotton’s claim is one of its most problematic features. If Cotton had been referring to statements Obama made before he was president, he would have had a better argument, experts say. ""There’s a difference between what the president has said about the nuclear program while he was in the process of trying to get elected and comments that he has made when trying to garner support in Congress and then today, when trying to explain what he has,"" said Richard Brennan, a political scientist at the Rand Corp. Brennan pointed us to a March 2007 speech Obama made in Chicago to the American-Israel Public Affairs Committee, a pro-Israel group. In his remarks, Obama said, ""The world must work to stop Iran’s uranium enrichment program and prevent Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons."" Uranium enrichment is a key component of any nuclear program, not simply a nuclear weapons program, so this could be interpreted as Obama talking about more than simply preventing Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon. On balance, Brennan agreed with other experts we checked with that, on its face, Cotton’s statement ""was probably not accurate."" By the time negotiations seriously began in late 2013, the administration had changed its position to ensuring primarily that Iran did not have a nuclear weapon. Our ruling Cotton said that Obama ""said at the beginning of the negotiations that the basic approach was to dismantle Iran’s nuclear program in exchange for dismantling the sanctions."" In 2007 or even as late as 2012, that might have been true, though believing so requires some careful parsing of the words and intentions of Obama and his advisers. Still, by late 2013 -- the negotiation period Cotton specifically referred to -- the administration had settled on a strategy of blocking a pathway to a nuclear weapon, rather than eliminating any trace of nuclear activities in Iran, including energy. On Dec. 7, 2013, Obama himself explicitly repudiated the idea that it would be possible to fully dismantle ""every single nut and bolt of their nuclear program.""

"['Economy', 'Florida', 'Jeff  Atwater']","
Greece employs three times as many government workers as Florida, Atwater says
","Florida Chief Financial Officer Jeff Atwater capitalized on news about the floundering Greek economy to point out a new report that said the Florida economy was doing just fine. In an ""open letter to the people of Florida,"" Atwater said the Sunshine State had been ranked fifth in fiscal solvency by George Mason University’s Mercatus Center. He then contrasted Florida’s success with the beleaguered European nation. ""A country in economic peril, Greece’s priorities have historically been very different from Florida’s,"" Atwater wrote on July 13, 2015. ""For example, Greeks depend much more on their government for employment and services. Although we have twice the population of Greece, the State of Florida employs three times fewer government employees."" PunditFact previously confirmed that Greece’s economic output is comparable to Miami, but could that 3-to-1 comparison of public-sector workers be accurate? Yes, if you’re looking at Florida’s direct employees, but experts we talked to said Atwater’s comparison is deeply flawed. Greek tragedy First of all, let’s stipulate that Greece’s population is about 11 million, while the Census Bureau says Florida is now closing in on 20 million, so he’s close on that point. Comparing employment is a bit trickier, since Greece’s public-sector employment has been in flux. To adhere to what its European lenders are demanding, Greece has spent several years trying to cut down its reliance on public-sector jobs. Atwater’s office told us they used 2013 data from Greece’s Ministry of Administrative Reform and E-Governance for Greek government workers (653,746) and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Current Employment Statistics program for Florida state employees (207,008).  Several sources agreed 2015 estimates put the current number of Greek public-sector employees at around 600,000. Florida’s employee numbers have stayed relatively stable in that time frame, with about 208,000 this year, so it looks like the 3-to-1 ratio Atwater cited could stand.  But our experts said the CFO is really comparing oranges to olives here.  Rollins College business professor James Johnson pointed out that those 600,000 Greek jobs include all government workers -- those paid by the central government and those paid by regional and municipal governments. A better way to measure the state’s government employment would be to add Florida’s 133,000 or so federal workers to Atwater’s 207,000 total, Rollins said. And even more important are the more than 730,000 workers toiling away at the local level. Also, Washington sends money to Florida that directly and indirectly affects workers at the state and local levels. Add that all up, and there are almost 1.1 million government employees on all levels across Florida at any given time. That is quite a bit more than the 600,000 or so Greek government workers.  Experts also note that Greek economic woes aren’t entirely about how many people are currently employed by the government. ""Greece’s problem was not so much the size of its public sector, but generous retirement benefits, including pensions,"" Johnson said. Greece doesn’t even top Europe in terms of highest percentage of the workforce employed by the public sector. In 2011, before Greece started cutting workers, it ranked behind Italy, Germany and France. In any event, fairly comparing a single U.S. state with a sovereign nation is largely impossible, considering the different sets of responsibilities each bears, our experts said.  Atwater’s office reiterated that it was making a point that the Greek central government is wasteful and poorly run when compared to Florida, but experts told us that it’s difficult at best to draw such parallels. ""It’s sort of a totally different system. It is fair to say the state of Florida is more efficient than the country of Greece, but you could say that about any other state,"" Jupiter-based financial analyst Tom Essaye said. ""It would be much more fair to compare Florida to other states than Greece."" Our ruling Atwater said, ""the State of Florida employs three times fewer government employees"" than Greece. Florida does directly employ about one-third as many state government workers as Greece does. But a more reasonable comparison should also include government workers at the federal and local levels -- which means Florida’s overall total of government workers would outnumber Greece’s public-sector employees.  The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Rush Limbaugh: Al Franken 'said almost exactly' what Donald Trump said about John McCain's POW past
","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s denunciation of Arizona Sen. John McCain’s military record may have stunned the political world, but some pundits played down Trump’s diss by resurrecting a similarly worded quote about McCain from a Democrat 15 years ago. Pundits from Rush Limbaugh to The Weekly Standard’s John McCormack to MSNBC’s Joe Scarborough have pointed to McCain’s current colleague Sen. Al Franken, D-Minn., as another man who questioned the valor of McCain’s POW experience. Limbaugh in particular said on his July 20 radio show that the lack of uproar around Franken’s comments proves the bias of ""leftists"" and the media. ""Al Franken, back in 2002 before he was running for anything, Al Franken said almost exactly what Trump said,"" Limbaugh said. ""There hasn’t been any outrage at any of this that has been said about McCain by leftists. Proving my point -- when leftists attack McCain, they are perfectly warranted because they are nice people and they are compassionate people and they’re politically correct people."" Limbaugh contrasted this to Trump’s portrayal of McCain. ""He’s not a war hero,"" Trump said July 18 at the Family Leadership Summit, a presidential forum in Ames, Iowa. ""He’s a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren’t captured."" We wanted to find out if Limbaugh was comparing apples to apples. Did Franken really insult McCain like Trump? Remembering Franken’s comedic past Relevant to this fact-check is Franken’s former day job. Before he joined the U.S. Senate in 2009, Franken worked as a comedy writer and actor. He was on staff of Saturday Night Live in its first few seasons and again from 1985 to 1995. After that, he wrote several books that parodied conservative politics, including 1999’s Rush Limbaugh is a Big Fat Idiot and Other Observations. In his 2004 book Lies: And The Lying Liars Who Tell Them, Franken describes a 1999 speech he gave to the White House News Photographers Association in which he rattles off essentially the same lines. According to his book, the riff went like this (italics are Franken’s): ""Hey, I like John McCain. And I really think he’s courageous. I mean, his stance on campaign finance reform and tobacco. Wow. That takes guts. But this whole ‘war hero’ thing — I don’t get it. I mean, as far as I’m concerned, he sat out the war. I mean, anyone can get captured! Am I wrong, but isn’t the idea to capture the other guy?"" The line was skewered in the conservative Washington Times as ""landing with a thud."" Franken, though, described it as getting ""big laughs"" with the news photographers and said the Times had put his remarks through the ""de-irony-izer"" to make him look unpatriotic. (We could not find more coverage of the speech.) In the book, Franken framed the joke in the context of admiring McCain, with whom he shared a mutual friend in a Vietnam War protester. Most pundits comparing Franken's comments to Trump's aren't using this speech as their example. Instead they highlight a 2000 Salon.com article that featured a few paragraphs from Franken and other newsmakers about the 2000 presidential election. McCain vied for the GOP nomination that year but withdrew from the race in March 2000 as George W. Bush pulled ahead. ""I doubt I could cross the line and vote Republican. I have tremendous respect for McCain but I don’t buy the war hero thing. Anybody can be captured. I thought the idea was to capture them. As far as I’m concerned he sat out the war."" Limbaugh was quick to point out the similarities between the two statements, crying foul at the perceived double standard for conservatives and liberals. But Limbaugh appears to have missed Franken’s intent, even if it was not obvious According to Franken press secretary Michael Dale-Stein, the remark ""was a joke."" (Michael Alvear, the author of the Salon piece, no longer works for the publication and couldn’t be reached for comment.) More than taking Dale-Stein’s word for it, we looked for more evidence. The Salon piece wasn’t the last time Franken used the bit about McCain’s war record. In 2004, Franken had McCain as a guest on his Air America radio show, The O’Franken Factor, where he retooled the bit for a third time. Franken jokingly suggested that only McCain’s political courage should be rewarded, and not his military service in Vietnam. Franken’s Senate office provided only the following excerpt from the interview. We tried to locate a copy or transcript of the show but could not find one. ""Because, I mean, I consider you a hero, tremendous political courage,"" Franken tells McCain, according to a transcript provided by Franken’s office, ""not, you know, the thing about five years, or five and a half years at the Hanoi Hilton; as far as I'm concerned you just sat out the war. I don't consider that real heroism.  Anybody can get captured, right?"" Some news accounts at the time suggested that Franken ""took considerable heat"" for talking about McCain’s imprisonment so lightly. MSNBC’s Scarborough recently said on Morning Joe that Trump was repeating Franken's ""despicable joke."" Spokespersons for Limbaugh and McCain could not be reached for comment. Our rating Limbaugh claimed, ""Al Franken said almost exactly what Trump said"" about John McCain’s war-hero credentials. Franken has literally used similar words as Trump in describing McCain’s military record — but it’s misleading to look at the comments without context. A closer look at Franken’s books and coverage of the 1999 event where he used this bit — before the Salon article came out — shows Franken meant the insult sarcastically. It may be a despicable joke to some, but it’s a joke nonetheless. Trump, however, has not insisted that his comment was meant as satire. Limbaugh’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details and takes things out of context.

Walker: If women seeking an abortion see their ultrasound, odds are pretty high they will keep baby
","Two days after Gov. Scott Walker announced for president, conservative commentator Laura Ingraham wanted to know if the Wisconsin Republican planned to mislead voters. Interviewing the governor July 15, 2015 on her nationally syndicated radio show, Ingraham referred to a National Journal article that was published on the eve of Walker’s announcement. An anonymous longtime Walker adviser had said Walker would run as a conservative early in the campaign, then position himself as more moderate. ""Is that what you’re going to do?"" Ingraham asked. ""Move to the middle after arguing that you’re the real conservative in this race?"" Walker said no, and then went on to list a number of his accomplishments as governor that are important to conservatives. One is a law that requires women seeking an abortion to first get an ultrasound -- although they are not required to view it. ""We know if people can see that unborn child, particularly with the latest technology, the odds are pretty high they’re going to keep the baby,"" Walker said. Do most women seeking an abortion change their mind after seeing their ultrasound scan? Previous fact check We’ve previously reviewed a claim similar to Walker’s. A couple of weeks before Walker signed the ultrasound requirement law in July 2013, conservative pundit Rachel Campos-Duffy, the wife of U.S. Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wis., said ""upwards of 90 percent"" of women seeking an abortion decide not to have an abortion after seeing an ultrasound. We rated her statement False. One anti-abortion organization claimed a figure of nearly 90 percent for its ultrasound program among a certain group of women. But there was no solid evidence to back Campos-Duffy’s claim, which was more sweeping than Walker’s. Evidence backing Walker Walker’s campaign cited two pieces of evidence that have surfaced since our Campos-Duffy fact check. 1. Anti-abortion group The first is a short news release issued in March 2015 by the National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, which describes itself as a ""national legal network of prolife pregnancy centers."" The release described a survey that the group said it did of some of its centers. According to the release, 410 of the group’s 1,050 centers that offer ultrasounds responded to the survey. And in 75,318 cases in 2013 in which ultrasounds were given -- to what the group labeled as ""abortion-minded"" or ""abortion-vulnerable"" women -- 78 percent of the women decided against having an abortion. The release did not say whether there was follow-up to see if the women gave birth, which is what Walker claims. And like much of the evidence we reviewed in the Campos-Duffy fact check this evidence is self-reported by a group that actively advocates against abortion. 2. Academic study Walker’s campaign also cited an academic study published in January 2014 in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology. The researchers reviewed medical records for 15,575 visits by women seeking abortion care at Planned Parenthood clinics in Los Angeles in 2011. Among women who viewed their ultrasound images, over 98.4 percent of the pregnancies were terminated. But Walker’s campaign highlighted a narrower finding of the study. Some 93 percent of the women had entered the clinic expressing what the researchers characterized as a high degree of certainty that they wanted an abortion. Among the 7 percent who expressed medium or low certainty about their decision, viewing the ultrasound ""was significantly associated with deciding to continue the pregnancy."" But, clearly, that involves a small percentage of the women in the study. Two experts We spoke with one of the authors of the study, University of California at San Francisco School of Medicine professor Katrina Kimport; and with Michele Chadwick, executive director of the anti-abortion ICU Mobile, which is based in Akron, Ohio. They agreed on two points: 1. Neither had seen any peer-reviewed academic research to back Walker’s claim. 2. For some women, particularly those less sure about having an abortion, viewing an ultrasound can be one factor in deciding to continue a pregnancy. And often that decision to continue is not made simply as a result of viewing the ultrasound, but because counseling and other services are provided in addition to the scan. Kimport added that research shows the most common reason women state for getting an abortion is not being able to afford caring for a child, and viewing an ultrasound wouldn’t change that circumstance.   Our rating Walker said that if women seeking an abortion see their ultrasound, ""the odds are pretty high they're going to keep the baby."" There is some evidence that some women considering an abortion opt to continue the pregnancy after seeing their ultrasound, although experts said that decision is typically based on counseling or other services that are offered along with the ultrasound. Meanwhile, the latest academic study we found shows that nearly all women who are more certain about their decision proceed with an abortion even after seeing the ultrasound. And we found no independent studies to back Walker’s statement. For a claim that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/22/scott-walker/if-they-see-their-ultrasound-most-women-seeking-ab/

Increase of murders in Atlanta?
","Crime is always the sort of news that attracts headlines. Now it’s also generating posts in online forums, where one neighborhood association alerted Atlanta residents that the city’s murder rate was spiking and had even reached a 50 percent increase from a year ago. PolitiFact Georgia couldn’t resist when an alert reader asked us to check it out. After all, the number of murders in several big cities is on the rise nationwide, after years of decline. That includes cities with populations close to those of Atlanta’s roughly 450,000 residents. For instance, through the first half of the year, Milwaukee (population 600,000) has seen a 105 percent surge in its homicide rate and the rate is up by 33 percent or more in Baltimore (about 620,000 residents) and St. Louis (about 320,000) And in Atlanta? According to the Atlanta Police Department website, the rate was up 16 percent in the first half of the year. Through July 11, the most recent date available, there have been 52 murders in the city. During the same time last year, there were 42 murders – a 24 percent increase. So while the increase is not as dramatic as suggested in the neighborhood forum or compared to similar cities, the rate is up. But the rates fluctuate wildly per week, which is how the police department reports all crimes. So it did appear that Atlanta had a serious surge of murders for the week ending May 23, or the 21st week of the year. Then, the homicide rate was up 54 percent at the time (40 murders at that point this year versus 26 last year). Then again, the city went without any murders for three weeks this year, between March 15 and April 2. And that spike in Week 21 was followed by no homicides in Week 22, the data show. In fact, the city had no murders at again for another multi-day run, between June 10 and June 20. ""These numbers are very fluid,"" said Atlanta Police Capt. Michael O’Connor, who serves as the department Homicide Commander. So while brass are concerned that the rate is up and in theory on pace to be above 100 annual murders for the first time in years, ""it’s very difficult to trend to know where you are going to finish the year."" Criminologists support that analysis – and lack of analysis that can be done. To some extent, after years of declining murder rates, an increase can be little more than a statistical blip to get closer to a median. But without minimizing the loss of 52 lives, there isn’t much statistical analysis that can be done with such a relatively low number, said Dennis Jay Kenney, a professor of criminology at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. For instance, only two women have been reported murder victims in Atlanta this year. While that may suggest the city has a better handle on domestic violence murders, a single such death could skew the data to suggest the exact opposite. ""You don’t want to jump to a lot of conclusions,"" Kenney said. ""If homicides are up, you are not necessarily at greater risk because we don’t randomly select our murder victims."" That is, there are some people more at risk to be victims than others. Broadly speaking, that tends to be young men, especially men of color. Atlanta Police have just begun sifting through its first-half data to compare victims, perpetrators and scenarios to see just where the greatest risks lie, O’Connor said. Police do that constantly, targeting for instance a specific neighborhood or specific gang that may be making trouble. Putting a larger number of victims and suspect pool up for comparison should help analysts see if anything stands out that will help insert police sooner into the equation – and hopefully prevent some deaths, O’Connor said. It also will provide Atlanta Police Chief George Turner with some information to share with his counterparts at the Major Cities Chiefs Association on Gun Violence Summit, being held in Washington, D.C. next month. Such events are often heavy on anecdotes, Kenney said, but can provide the start of understanding crime trends. ""When you can see a general increase virtually everywhere, that suggests crime is up but doesn’t tell you anything about why or what to do about it,"" he said. ""Still, the police have to anticipate what they can so they can refocus their energies, and they seem to be doing that."" Our ruling A neighborhood association alerted Atlanta residents that the city’s homicide rate is up for the year and has even reached a 50 percent increase. At one point, the murder rate did spike that high, though with weekly fluctuations, the year-to-date rate is up about a quarter from this time last year. That puts Atlanta in line with other cities seeing an increase in their murder rates. There is little conclusion on what might be driving the rate, or even if different cities share the same causes. But a 24 percent increase is cause for notice. We rate the claim True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/22/atlanta-neighborhood-association/increase-murders-atlanta/

Rand Paul: U.S. borrows $1 million a minute
","At a campaign rally in Houston, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., talked about one of his favorite dislikes: the national debt. ""You have people in Washington who do things you would never, ever approve of,"" said Paul, a Republican presidential candidate, in his July 17, 2015, remarks. ""I’ll give you an idea. Does anybody here think it’s a good idea to borrow money from China to send it to Pakistan? We borrow a million dollars every minute."" Does the country really borrow a million a minute? We decided to check it out. To evaluate Paul’s claim, we considered the federal deficit -- the difference between the government’s revenue intake and spending, which in recent years has been negative. To raise cash to keep the government running under a deficit, the Treasury has to take on debt. There are 525,600 minutes in a year, so borrowing $1 million a minute would mean the government borrows $525 billion a year. The federal deficit in fiscal year 2014 was $483 billion. The Congressional Budget Office’s projected deficit for 2015 is $486 billion. So Paul’s claim is a little high -- by about $40 billion a year -- but not too far off. Of course, though, it’s not as though the country is literally borrowing $1 million every single minute. Though while the national debt is growing overall, the debt accumulates unevenly, in fits and starts, from day to day as specific bills come due. Let’s also add some context. While in recent years, the country has borrowed ""a million dollars every minute,"" this is actually a big improvement from the rate during the Great Recession. Based on the same calculation we used earlier, the government borrowed more than $2.6 million a minute in 2009, at the height of the recession. That rate has slowed every year since. Additionally, the million-a-minute number doesn’t look so dramatic when you compare it to the fact that the U.S. economy generates about $33 million per minute in income, said Neil Buchanan, an expert in law, economics and the national debt at George Washington University Law School. Economists generally agree that debt and deficits are only meaningful as a percentage of a country's income, rather than as a raw number, Buchanan added. The Congressional Budget Office graph below shows the spike in federal budget deficit as a percentage of America’s gross domestic product over time. The longest bar (biggest deficit as a percentage of GDP) is 2009 -- at the height of the Great Recession. In the recovery period since, the deficit has declined, but projections show it possibly growing in the future.   ""The question should be how fast the debt is growing in relation to GDP. If GDP is growing faster, then the country can service the debt,"" said Linda Bilmes, a professor and expert in national budgetary issues at Harvard University. Our ruling Paul said, ""We borrow a million dollars every minute."" For the country to borrow $1 million a minute, the annual government deficit would have to be about $525 billion. In 2014, the deficit was $483 billion, and it’s projected to be $486 billion in 2015. So Paul’s estimate is a little on the high side. On balance, we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2015/jul/21/rand-paul/rand-paul-us-borrows-1-million-minute/

Jeb Bush says a law passed under Bill Clinton banned guns at military recruiting offices
","A day after the shooting rampage at two military sites in Chattanooga that would ultimately take the lives of four Marines and a Navy petty officer, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush -- a Republican presidential candidate -- pointed the finger at former President Bill Clinton’s administration for a law that he said banned the carrying of guns by military recruiters. The shootings took place at two sites -- a military recruiting office in a strip mall and a Navy Operational Support Center. The gunman -- Mohammad Youssef Abdulazeez, 24, a native of Kuwait who had lived in Tennessee for most of his life -- was shot dead by police. Authorities are investigating the killings but haven’t yet confirmed a terrorist motive. Speaking at a Carson City, Nev., town hall on July 17, Bush said, ""A law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices … Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited."" Bush was one of several Republican candidates to call for an end to such a gun prohibition. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, another GOP presidential candidate, also pointed blame at Clinton. Bush’s claim raised two questions for us: Are guns prohibited at recruiting offices? And if so, is that due to a law passed under President Clinton? Policies about guns and the military As it turns out, there is a policy that’s relevant here -- but it’s not as straightforward as Bush suggests, and it wasn’t written under Clinton. It stemmed from an effort under Bush’s father, then-President George H.W. Bush. In 1992, when Bush was president, the Department of Defense issued a directive related to firearms for military personnel. That directive replaced an earlier one from 1986. The directive doesn’t specifically address recruiting offices, but it applies broadly to military sites. The 1992 directive, signed by then-Deputy Secretary of Defense Donald Atwood, didn’t outright ban military personnel from carrying weapons. Instead, it said that only certain employees could carry weapons, including those who worked in law enforcement, security and prisons. The directive also did not apply in certain situations, such as in war zones. The policy explains that the intent is ""to limit and control the carrying of firearms by DoD military and civilian personnel."" So the policy did cover most military personnel. Those who have opposed this policy have sometimes referred to it as a Clinton-era policy because the Army did release a regulation that implemented the Defense Department directive in March 1993, two months after Clinton took office. (For more on a similar claim that circulated after a mass shooting at the Washington, D.C., Navy Yard, see the fact-checking website Snopes.) A new Defense Department directive issued in April 2011 after a mass shooting at Ft. Hood in Texas tweaked the policy with some new phrases, including that workers have an ""inherent right to self-defense."" However, the overall policy essentially remained the same. Here is part of that directive: ""Arming DoD personnel (i.e., administrative, assessment, or inspection, not regularly engaged in or directly supervising security or law enforcement activities) shall be limited to missions or threats and the immediate need to protect DoD assets or persons’ lives. DoD Components have the discretion to keep designated staff personnel qualified and available or on call to perform duties."" The recruiting office where the shooting occurred represented all four branches of the military. We could not reach a spokesperson for the Marines. However Brian Lepley, a spokesman for U.S. Army Recruiting Command, said that ""weapons are not permitted in recruiting stations by DoD because there are no law enforcement personnel there."" Many on the Internet noted the gun-free sign on the military recruiting office door. ""Once you cross that door, you are not allowed to have a weapon in there,"" Lepley said. The president’s role So should we blame Clinton -- or any president -- for the Department of Defense directive? ""No, I wouldn’t,"" said Richard Brennan, a senior political scientist at the RAND Corporation and a career Army officer. ""And frankly I’m unaware of any statute that prevents military personnel from carrying weapons. What there has been at least since 1975 when I was a cadet were policies and regulations that govern the circumstances under which military personnel can carry weapons."" Over the years, those policies have consistently said that personnel working as law enforcement and protecting life or federal property can carry firearms. ""There hasn’t been marked change in this,"" he said. While a president could get involved in this level of detail if they wanted to, this is generally settled at a lower pay grade. Such directives are ""internally generated by a need seen either within civilian military leadership or military leadership,"" Brennan said. Typically, they update earlier policies, he added. Steven Bucci, a military expert for the Heritage Foundation and former Army colonel, told PolitiFact that the policy about firearms existed for decades before Clinton, or Bush for that matter. ""As far back as when I joined the military in 1973, and probably further back, you have never been able to carry firearms, privately owned or government, on military installations. You always had to register it with the MP's and keep them locked in the arms rooms,"" he said, referring to military police. Bucci has disputed previous claims that President Clinton ""disarmed"" the military. ""No one ‘disarmed’ the military -- the military itself prefers to manage good order and discipline by not having everyone armed,"" he told PolitiFact. In the wake of the shooting rampage in Tennessee, several lawmakers have said they plan to introduce bills to get rid of the military directive about firearms. Then-Rep. Steve Stockman, R-Texas, introduced a bill in 2013 to repeal the Defense Department directive and prohibit the military from instituting any restrictions on guns. But it never received a vote. We sent a summary of our findings about the defense directives to a spokeswoman for Bush. She reiterated his viewpoint. ""The Clinton administration implemented this policy to prohibit guns in military recruitment offices,"" said Allie Brandenburger. ""Gov. Bush believes military recruiters should be allowed to carry guns."" Our ruling Bush said that ""a law was passed, apparently in the Clinton administration, about whether, in recruiting offices … Marines or other military should be able to have guns. Apparently it is prohibited."" The Department of Defense issued a directive, not a law, in 1992 -- when Bush’s father was president. It did not ban firearms outright; it limited them to military personnel who held certain jobs, such as positions in law enforcement. And while the Army issued a regulation implementing that directive in 1993 -- two months after Clinton was in office -- experts say it is not the sort of matter that would typically rise to the attention of a president. Bush has a point that, for the most part, military personnel can’t have firearms at recruiting offices. But most of everything else he said was incorrect.

After 'not a war hero' remark, Donald Trump says John McCain has 'done nothing' for veterans
","Facing a continuing maelstrom over his remark that Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is ""not a war hero,"" billionaire businessman and GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump wants to shift the focus from McCain’s service record to his track record.    McCain may talk a lot about supporting American troops, Trump insisted on ABC’s This Week, but he doesn’t walk the walk. ""I'm very disappointed in John McCain, because the vets are horribly treated in this country. I'm fighting for the vets. I've done a lot for the vets,"" Trump said on July 19. ""He's done nothing to help the vets. And I will tell you, they are living in hell."" He echoed the point that same day in an editorial published in USA Today. Trump wrote: ""Thanks to McCain and his Senate colleague Bernie Sanders, their legislation to cover up the VA scandal, in which 1,000+ veterans died waiting for medical care, made sure no one has been punished, charged, jailed, fined or held responsible. McCain has abandoned our veterans. I will fight for them."" Is Trump correct that that McCain -- a Vietnam prisoner of war and current chairman of the Senate Armed Services committee -- hasn’t helped his fellow veterans? The Trump campaign never got back to us, but McCain’s office did, and, not surprisingly, they begged to differ. They provided a wide variety of examples of things McCain has done for veterans during his nearly three-decade congressional career. Here are a few of the most recent ones: • Military families. In June 2015, McCain co-sponsored an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 to cover the travel costs for the family of troops killed in overseas missions. The amendment was adopted by the Senate by unanimous consent. • Veterans health. McCain introduced the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act in early 2015 to increase access to mental health support for veterans. It has become law. • Department of Veterans Affairs. In 2014, McCain -- along with Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, a Democratic presidential candidate -- led efforts to address the scandal over secret waiting lists at VA hospitals by pushing the The Veterans’ Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act all the way to enactment. In 2015, McCain co-sponsored a bill to increase accountability at the department. • Non-legislative support. McCain’s office employs five caseworkers solely dedicated to helping veterans who are running into problems at the Department of Veterans Affairs. A spokeswoman told us McCain’s office has handled more than 2,000 veterans-related cases in 2015 alone. We also reached out to veterans groups. Even those who have taken issue with McCain’s record on veterans disagreed with Trump that McCain has ""done nothing"" for vets. Decorated veteran Brandon Friedman, a former Obama administration official and vice chairman of the progressive VoteVets PAC, detailed McCain’s history of failing veterans in 2008, but rejected Trump’s characterization. "" ‘Nothing’ is a strong word,"" Friedman told us. ""He hasn't been great on veterans issues. That being said … the senator doesn't deserve that."" Groups that gave McCain failing grades during his 2008 White House bid agreed with Friedman. Though McCain voted with Disabled Veterans of America about 20 percent of the time in 2008, the group praised McCain in 2014 ""for putting partisan politics aside to quickly pass bipartisan legislation in response to the current VA health care crisis."" Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America also gave McCain a grade of D in 2010, but pointed to a specific example of McCain’s recent support. ""I have had the honor of working with Sen. McCain on key veterans legislation, including the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act,"" CEO Paul Rieckhoff wrote in the New York Daily News. Other groups also rushed to McCain’s defense. ""Donald Trump also revealed that he has no idea what he is talking about with regards to reforming and fixing the VA. If he did, he would have known that Senator McCain has been a leader in fighting to give veterans more health care choices and to hold the VA accountable for its failures,"" Concerned Veterans for America wrote in statement Navy Vice Adm. Norb Ryan, president of the Military Officers Association of America, said in a press release that McCain has a been a ""champion"" for troops and veterans, arguing that no one has visited American troops more than McCain. ""We can disagree with some of Sen. McCain’s positions at times, but we can never say he has abandoned the troops,"" Ryan wrote on July 20. ""We should acknowledge the facts: John McCain cares deeply about our men and women in uniform, and through his actions, he has made a real difference for our troops. Mr. Trump owes Sen. McCain and all veterans an apology."" Our ruling Trump said that McCain ""has done nothing to help the vets."" While many veterans’ groups have had their differences with McCain over the years over specific legislation and his general approach to veterans’ issues, that’s not the same as saying he’s done ""nothing"" for veterans. In fact, just within the past two years, McCain has sponsored and helped enact several major provisions to help veterans. He also devotes a significant portion of his office staff to offer veterans on casework.

Pluto's advocates say even Earth would not count as a planet if it were in Pluto's place
","The world’s best-ever glimpse of Pluto from the New Horizons spacecraft is giving the ""Pluto question"" new life: Should the icy orb be once again considered the ninth planet of our solar system? Images of the dwarf planet inspired a tide of Internet reaction last week, including memes, a funny interview between Pluto loyalist Stephen Colbert and astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson, and a petition signed by more than 4,100 people to bring Pluto back to full planet status. The petition on Change.org, which was started by the producers of the Yahoo! web series Other Space, wants world astronomers to reconsider their 2006 decision to classify Pluto as a dwarf planet in its August assembly in Honolulu. ""Not long after New Horizons was launched in 2006, the International Astronomical Union stripped Pluto of its planethood because it was different than the other eight planets that we committed to memory,"" the petition reads. ""By declaring that Pluto was no longer a planet, the IAU put into place a planetary definition that would have even declassified Earth as a planet if it existed as far from the Sun as Pluto does."" As crazy as it sounds, we wondered if the theoretical argument in the petition could really be accurate: Could Earth really be a dwarf planet in an alternate universe? (Assuming, of course, that Earth could form so far from the sun, which is not realistic.) The International Astronomical Union’s decision Ahead of Pluto’s demotion almost a decade ago, astronomers had been wrestling over what to do with the icy, diminutive planet as other bodies in the Kuiper Belt and elsewhere came to focus, including an even bigger world called Xena (renamed Eris). Should those bodies also be planets, or are they, like Pluto, something else? In 2006, the IAU came up with a resolution on how a planet ought to be defined. The IAU definition says a planet is a celestial body that meets the following criteria: Pluto passed the first two criteria, but it flunked the third about clearing the neighborhood around its orbit. We wondered if Earth would also fail to clear its neighborhood if it switched places with Pluto. And what in the heck does ""clearing the neighborhood"" mean anyway? Experts told us to think of it like a planet taking a broom to its orbit. "" ‘Clearing the neighborhood’ is like sweeping up and tossing out an accumulation of debris once and for all, where no outside source replaces it,"" said Steven Soter, a resident research associate at the American Museum of Natural History, who also proposed a method of measuring the cleanliness of a planet’s orbit. However, Soter says the IAU definition is misleading because no planet can ever entirely clear its neighborhood, as asteroids and comets often leak back into orbital zones from the outside, he said. ""The Earth even in its present location has not entirely ‘cleared’ its orbital zone,"" Soter said. ""Asteroids and comets clobber it every few million years."" Soter would rewrite the definition to say that a body must ""dynamically dominate"" its orbital zone in order to be considered a planet. This loosened definition means a planet could keep its neighborhood relatively clear in spite of constant debris coming in from the outside. Still, Pluto would not pass the planet test even under this term, Soter said. Pluto only dominates its own satellite system, and it has no influence on the rest of the Kuiper Belt that can be seen. If Earth were in Pluto’s position, Soter said it would still be a planet — but only marginally — based on its neighborhood-clearing abilities. Soter pointed to this wonky-looking graph to explain his point. 

The horizontal axis shows how far a planet is from the sun, while the vertical axis shows a planet’s mass relative to Earth. Every diagonal line on the graph shows how good a planet is at keeping its neighborhood relatively clear despite debris floating back in. Some planets (the larger ones at the top, such as Jupiter and Saturn) clear out more debris, and others (Mercury, Mars, the ones straddling the topmost diagonal line) clear out less. The farther a planet gets from the sun, the harder it is to keep its neighborhood clean.  Right now, Earth does pretty well for itself. But move our planet right from 1 AU to 40 AU (Pluto’s location), and Earth is not as good as clearing its neighborhood. Again, hypothetically speaking. ""The Earth in Pluto's orbit would have about the same dynamical power as Mercury or Mars, so it would (only) marginally dominate its new orbital zone,"" Soter said. So, Earth would still be a planet, but it would be close, he said. There is also another way of looking at this definition. Soter proposed a way of defining planets by looking at how significant a planet-like body is compared to other space debris in its zone. (Think of comparing the mass of the broom you’re using to the mass of garbage still left behind.) Would Earth still be a significant object when compared to everything else in Pluto’s neighborhood? Maybe. There is no way to predict and compare masses, he said. Arguments that support the petition The equation behind the graph was proposed by planetary scientists Harold Levison and Alan Stern, who is the lead investigator for the New Horizons mission to Pluto. Stern’s advocacy for Pluto being a planet is well-known, and he stressed in a phone interview that he has a very different take on this question than Soter. As he has said for years, Stern thinks Earth would not be able to clear Pluto’s zone and therefore not be a planet under the IAU parameters. The farther a planet (or planet-like body) is from the sun, the larger an object has to be to clear its orbital zone — which means Pluto, 4.67 billion miles from the sun, has it pretty rough out there. ""The Kuiper Belt zone (the zone Pluto has to clear) is bigger than the zones from Mercury to Neptune,"" Stern told PunditFact. Mark V. Sykes, director of the Planetary Science Institute in Tucson, Ariz., agrees with Stern that Earth would no longer be considered a planet if it were in Pluto’s location. Sykes went even further to suggest that Earth would no longer be a planet if it were placed between Jupiter and Saturn. ""The IAU definition is analogous to putting an apple in the middle of the table, then moving it to the edge of the table and declaring it is no longer an apple,"" he said. Both Stern and Soter faulted a time crunch at the 2006 meeting that resulted in a rushed set of criteria for planethood.  When the IAU proposed its new definition, Stern said, it was done ""overnight"" and no specific calculations were used. One of the concerns among scientists there was that if Pluto were admitted as a planet, then so would other space bodies. Some attendees worried there would be ""too many planets to memorize,"" Stern said. The concerns were ""not scientific … (but) somewhere between personal preference and political,"" Stern wrote in the Space article. There are also other concerns about the IAU’s decision. Only about 16-25 percent of the registered astronomers at the IAU meeting voted on the definition. Other scientists have also pointed out that the IAU’s definition is limited to our solar system and does not consider planets that might exist outside the solar system. We reached out to a representative from IAU to comment but did not hear back. Our ruling Other Space's petition claims, ""By declaring that Pluto was no longer a planet, the (International Astronomical Union) put into place a planetary definition that would have even declassified Earth as a planet if it existed as far from the sun as Pluto does."" Putting aside the fact that this could not actually happen, we heard very different opinions from scientists on whether the definition would really exclude Earth if it were in Pluto’s shoes. Pluto was demoted as a planet because it could not clear its orbital zone, a requirement established by the astronomers union. However, the IAU definition is ambiguous because no planet can ever completely clear its orbital zone. Absent a clearer definition, scientists disagree about whether Earth would be declassified in this far-fetched scenario, though it certainly would not do as good a job at ""clearing the neighborhood"" as it does now. The claim on the petition is partially accurate but leaves out important details — the main one being that we’ll never know for sure.

The Clintons really did attend Donald Trump's 2005 wedding
","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump’s controversial campaign could just be a ruse to sabotage the GOP, said U.S. Rep. Carlos Curbelo, R-Fla. After all, the billionaire is so friendly with Hillary Clinton, Trump invited her to his nuptials. ""I think there's a small possibility that this gentleman is a phantom candidate,"" Curbelo told Miami radio host Roberto Rodríguez Tejera on July 10, 2015. ""Mr. Trump has a close friendship with Bill and Hillary Clinton. They were at his last wedding. He has contributed to the Clintons' foundation. He has contributed to Mrs. Clinton's Senate campaigns. All of this is very suspicious."" We’re not going to rule on whether Trump and the Clintons are friends -- as the old saying goes, ""If you want a friend in politics, get a dog!"" -- but we did want to find out if Curbelo had his wedding anecdote right. The short answer is, yes, the Clintons did attend Trump’s 2005 wedding to Melania Knauss. Well, current Democratic presidential candidate Hillary was at the ceremony. Former President Bill didn’t show up until the reception. Because who wouldn’t want to participate in that Electric Slide lineup? It was the then-58-year-old Trump’s third wedding. Before he got hitched to Slovenian former model Knauss, who was 34 at the time, he had been married first to Ivana Trump and then Marla Maples. Clinton had a front-pew seat at the Episcopal Church of Bethesda-by-the-Sea in Palm Beach for the wedding on Jan. 22, 2005. People magazine said that the 450-person guest list included former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani and media and entertainment personalities like Katie Couric, Matt Lauer, Simon Cowell, Regis Philbin, Kelly Ripa, Star Jones and Barbara Walters. The fun really started after the ceremony in the ballrom at Trump’s own Mar-a-Lago Club resort in Palm Beach. Bill Clinton showed up in time for a party that included performances by Billy Joel, Paul Anka and Tony Bennett. The reception also featured a 200-pound, 5-foot-tall wedding cake. As for whether Trump contributed to the Clinton Foundation and Hillary Clinton’s senate campaigns, Trump has admitted as much. ""I’m a businessman, I contribute to everybody,"" Trump told Fox & Friends on July 15. (PunditFact has found to be the case.) ""That’s part of the problem with the system. I contribute to everybody. When I need Hillary, she was there. If I say go to my wedding, they go to my wedding. I contribute to everybody and you know what, that’s part of the problem with our system."" Trump told the U.K.’s Daily Mail in May that he had never gotten any favors for his donations to the Clintons, ""but they do kiss my ass"" to get that money. He also has called Hillary Clinton ""the worst secretary of state in the history of the United States.""

Wisconsin AFL-CIO says Scott Walker budget means 'no weekend for workers'
","Gov. Scott Walker may have vetoed 104 items from the 2015-’17 budget, but he left in one that has Democrats and union leaders upset. The Wisconsin State AFL-CIO posted a meme to its Facebook page July 8, 2015 that in bold letters proclaims: ""Scott Walker’s bad budget includes: No weekend for workers."" The meme goes on to say the change could ""lead to intimidation in the workplace and to an environment where bosses can pressure workers into working every single day of every single month without needed rest."" It’s not the first time unions have slammed the governor.The most notable outcry came after Walker and Republicans passed Act 10, which sharply curtailed collective bargaining for most public employees. More recently, Walker signed a ""right-to-work"" measure in March 2015 that prohibits requiring private sector workers to pay union fees. The no-weekend claim had come up before. An opinion piece published in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel written by Stephanie Bloomingdale, secretary-treasurer of the Wisconsin State AFL-CIO declared, ""they took away the weekend."" And a Gawker article, shared widely on social media sites, was titled, ""Wisconsin is trying to take away your right to a weekend."" So, now that it’s summer, it begs this important question: Will you have to work this Saturday and Sunday? Background on the law Since the 1970s, a law has required employers operating factories or retail stores to give workers at least 24 hours off every seven days. That law does not apply to janitors, security personnel or those who care for live animals. People who are employed in the manufacture of butter, cheese or other dairy products, or in bakeries, flour and feed mills, hotels and restaurants are also exempt. Passage of the law came on the coattails of federal legislation -- the Occupational Safety and Health Act -- aimed at assuring safe and healthy working conditions. Wisconsin, and most other states, passed additional legislation in 1971 to improve employment standards. In 2014, Republican lawmakers pushed a bill that would have allowed workers to voluntarily forgo that day of rest. The bill, which the state AFL-CIO lobbied against, passed committee, but did not get a vote in the full Senate. At that time, supporters said the bill would give workers a way to earn some extra money, while allowing companies to increase production. For instance, if a company needed to run extra hours to fulfill an order, all workers would be eligible to get a piece of the extra cash. Sponsors said the idea came from the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce. The Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce and the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce also lobbied in support of the bill. Backers of the change noted the federal government does not impose limits on consecutive work days. How it changes The provision inserted into the state budget permits employees in certain industries  to voluntarily work seven days in a row. It was added in committee July 7, 2015, a day before the GOP-controlled Senate passed the budget. So who can volunteer to work seven days without rest? The same workers protected under the old law. So really just a fraction of workers in the state are affected by the budget provision -- though the union offers it as so sweeping that everyone might be affected.  ""There will be a chilling effect for everyone,"" Bloomingdale said in an interview. ""It sends the message that it’s acceptable to go without a day of rest."" John Witte, professor emeritus of political science and public affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said the union’s statement is ""clearly overstating the case."" Witte said one problem for the workers is that employers could take advantage of the provision and subtly coerce workers to ""volunteer."" ""If, however, employers tried to make that an overt requirement of employment, the workers could use that as a legal argument against the employer because that would clearly violate the voluntary nature of the action,"" Witte said. Our rating The state AFL-CIO said, ""Scott Walker’s bad budget includes: No weekend for workers."" But the provision does not apply to all workers, as the claim suggests. What’s more, it is a voluntary thing -- workers could agree to the extra day to, for instance, earn extra overtime. We rate the claim False. ",/factchecks/2015/jul/21/wisconsin-state-afl-cio/wisconsin-afl-cio-says-scott-walker-budget-means-n/

Pam Geller spreads false claim about ISIS-linked tweet previewing Chattanooga attack
","As the public waited for details about the Chattanooga, Tenn., shooting attack that left five servicemen dead, anti-Islam activist Pamela Geller claimed that an ISIS supporter knew about the shooting before it happened. The shooting started at a military recruiting center on July 16, 2015, at 10:45 a.m. local time. Geller said the tweet from an ISIS supporter with #Chattanooga came 11 minutes before the attack at 10:34 a.m. (That supporter’s account has since been suspended.)  Geller thought she was on to something, and the story spread to Robert Spencer’s ""Jihad Watch"" before taking off across other media channels. But the ISIS ""warning"" tweet wasn’t a warning so much as eerie post-attack commentary. What happened shows what can go wrong when you jump to conclusions about Twitter’s timestamps. The ISIS supporter’s tweet was actually published at 10:34 a.m. Pacific Standard Time, which means it was shared almost three hours after the shooting began. This became clear by Thursday evening, when Bret Baier shared on The O’Reilly Factor that the ISIS tweet was posted after the shooting took place. (The liberal website Media Matters for America published a timeline of the events as they spread on Fox News; the ISIS-tweet narrative lasted several hours.) The ISIS tweet spread like wildfire before people noticed the real timestamp of the pro-ISIS tweet. In an interview with PunditFact, Geller said that at the time she wrote her tweet, she was not aware that ""Twitter's time stamping was not uniform."" ""I updated the post when new information became available,"" Geller said. We have not been able to find any additional tweets from Geller indicating the incorrect timestamp from her first tweet, which is still still published online. Geller did post an update to one of her website articles about the ISIS tweet and timestamp issue. Another article on her website has not yet been updated. Authorities are still investigating whether there is an ISIS connection. The shooter, Muhammad Youssef Abdulazeez, was killed by police. On her website, Geller points out that the ISIS tweet was posted before the shooter was named or ""before we knew that the killer was a devout Muslim waging jihad,"" which to her is enough proof that the shooting was at least ISIS-inspired. Other news sources have been more careful in describing Abdulazeez’s possible motivations or allegiances. ABC News described Abdulazeez as a ""disturbed (and) suicidal"" man who wrote about ""becoming a martyr."" Still, Abdulazeez apparently called ISIS a ""stupid group … completely against Islam"" during a conversation with a friend, according to CNN. There are also different interpretations of Abdulazeez’s seven-month trip to Jordan. Family members said the trip was intended to ""get (Abdulazeez) away from bad influences in the U.S."" A government source told CBS that Abdulazeez did not travel outside of Jordan during his visit and there is no proof of him visiting Iraq or Syria. But a close friend of Abdulazeez said he changed after coming back. Our ruling Geller claimed that an ISIS supporter tweeted ahead of the Chattanooga shooting. The claim gained a lot of traction before it became clear that the tweet happened a few hours after the shooting. Geller updated the original post, but it did little to stuff the rumor back into the bag. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2015/jul/21/pamela-geller/pam-geller-spreads-false-claim-about-isis-linked-t/

Dunwoody on target with claim about police department certification
","The 6-year-old Dunwoody Police Department was recognized July 13 for achieving state certification. Billy Grogan, Dunwoody’s police chief, said the certification validates that his  department’s standards are in line with national best practices. ""Members of the Dunwoody Police Department have faithfully served Dunwoody for over six years, and I hope this achievement will instill even greater public confidence in our agency and staff,"" Grogan said in a press release issued July 14. ""There are more than 700 law enforcement agencies in Georgia, and fewer than 20 percent of those agencies have achieved this status,"" the release said. That statistic caught our eye. Georgia is second in the nation only to Texas in the number of counties, with 159. All those counties have sheriffs and sheriff’s departments. At least a dozen mostly metro counties also have county police forces. Scattered throughout those counties, according to the Georgia Municipal Association, are 538 cities of varying sizes, 352 with police chiefs. That doesn’t count the host of state law enforcement agencies, including the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and State Patrol. With all those law enforcement agencies in Georgia, could fewer than 20 percent be state-certified? We decided to do a little investigating. First, some background about the voluntary, 18-month to two-year process of becoming state-certified. The process begins with the agency undertaking a self-assessment. The department then goes through the time-consuming process of ensuring that all its policies and procedures conform with state laws and follow best practices in eight key areas. These include training, personnel, evidence, warrants, victims and witnesses, said Mark Bender, the director of state certification for the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police. Before a department is awarded state certification, an independent team of assessors, typically from another law enforcement agency, makes an onsite visit to determine whether the department’s officers and staff are adhering to those policies and procedures, Bender said. State certification is good for three years and renewable after a re-evaluation. Costs are about $650 for the initial certification, $375 a year for each subsequent year, Bender said. Officers in a state-certified department can take pride in knowing they’ve set high standards of professionalism for themselves and have voluntarily agreed to be reviewed every three years to see that they’re living up to those standards, he said. The state recognition can increase a community’s respect and support for a department, Bender said. The department also can benefit financially: A 20 percent discount is offered on premiums for state-certified police departments if their cities are part of the GMA’s property and liability insurance pool. Fifty-five agencies are currently receiving the discount for a combined savings of $261,000, said Amy Henderson, a GMA spokeswoman. The first state certification was issued in 1997, and 118 law enforcement agencies are currently state-certified through the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, Bender said. They include city police departments, sheriff’s departments, county police departments, campus police departments, the GBI and the Georgia World Congress Center. The Atlanta Police Department and Cobb, DeKalb, Fulton and Gwinnett county police departments are all state-certified. Frank V. Rotondo, the executive director of the Georgia Association of Chiefs of Police, said the reasons vary why local law enforcement agencies don’t pursue state certification. The process requires going ""through a lot of extra hoops, and some don’t want to do it,"" Rotondo said. ""Some don’t have the extra money to do what’s required."" For instance, he said, a state-certified police department is expected to maintain a statistical evaluation to justify its traffic enforcement efforts,  and some are too small to take on this extra work. ""We wouldn’t want 100 percent,"" Rotondo said. State-certified agencies should be ""better than most,"" he said. So what about the specific claim that out of 700 law enforcement agencies in the state, fewer than 20 percent are state-certified? That statement is based largely on an often-repeated statistic from the police chiefs association that indicates there are about 700 law enforcement agencies in the state. Rotondo told us that’s an estimate. An exact count would be difficult, he said. For instance,  one small city police force in Middle Georgia is currently looking at dissolving and allowing the county sheriff’s office to take over, Rotondo said. The Georgia Peace Officer Standards and Training Council gave PolitiFact data showing the state has 1,178 law enforcement agencies and 58,413 law enforcement personnel. But Rotondo said many of those agencies do not qualify for state certification. He suggested we stick to the 700 estimate. When we do, we come up with roughly 17 percent (or 118) are state-certified. Our ruling The Dunwoody Police Department recently was recognized for becoming state certified. The city press release said: There are more than 700 law enforcement agencies in Georgia and fewer than 20 percent of those agencies have achieved this status. But the bar also has to be high here. Claims need to be based on data or disclose, as in this case, that they are based, in part, on estimates. That’s missing context. We rate the statement Mostly True.  ",/factchecks/2015/jul/21/police-chief-billy-grogan/dunwoody-target-claim-about-police-department-cert/

Rick Perry says Texas shot to No. 2 from No. 27 in high-school graduation rates in about a decade
","It hasn’t been long since we checked a Rick Perry claim about the schools in his home state. In June, we found Mostly True the former governor’s declaration that Texas has the second-highest high school graduation rate in the country and the highest graduation rate for African Americans and Hispanics. That was close to entirely right. Then after that,  the second-time Republican presidential aspirant caught our interest when he said in a July 2, 2015, speech in Washington, D.C.: ""Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to second highest in the country in 2013."" As we wrote before, Perry was off by a notch in that Texas in 2012-13 tied for third with Wisconsin for its 88 percent graduation rate, according to a February 2015 federal chart. And did Texas rocket past two dozen states from about a decade before? Hold that thought: To arrive at his claim, Perry did the statistical equivalent of mixing apples and artichokes. That is, the measurement he cited for the No. 27 ranking was not the same measurement used to arrive at Texas’ No. 3 ranking. The more recent ranking reflected each state’s four-year ""adjusted cohort graduation rate,"" based on the ""number of students who graduate in four years with a regular high school diploma divided by the number of students who form the adjusted cohort for the graduating class,"" according to the National Center for Education Statistics, which is part of the U.S. Department of Education. The center says the size of each potential graduating class was adjusted starting the first year of high school by adding students who subsequently transferred in and subtracting students who transferred out, moved to another country or who died as reported by each state. Put another way, if Perry had stuck with the indicator that landed Texas around 27th nationally in 2001-02, he would have ensured accuracy by saying Texas was tied with four states for 22nd in 2011-12, the latest year of available data. A factor in Perry doing otherwise, we speculate, is the metric landing Texas at No. 3 wasn’t universally applied until a few years ago. 2001-02 Our search for 2002 data started with an email to Perry campaign aides asking about the basis of his comparison; we fielded no reply. When we asked the Texas Education Agency about the state’s 2002 graduation rate, spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson advised by email that the agency did not circulate state-by-state rankings at that time because accurate comparisons were believed to be hard to nail. In 2003, though, the Texas Legislature directed the department to ""compute dropout rates and graduation rates consistent with federal standards and definitions,"" Culbertson said. Nationally, she said, a mandated graduation rate standard was put in place in 2008 in accord with the No Child Left Behind Act (which was approved by Congress in 2001). ""It took some time for many states to develop the data collection and processing systems to calculate a rate based on four years of individual student-level data,"" Culbertson wrote. So, Texas in 2012-13 ranked near the top nationally in its graduation rate by a measure that wasn’t in place in 2002. Responding to our request for data covering earlier years, Culbertson noted that in 2002-03, the year after the one singled out by Perry, Texas ranked 29th nationally, tied with Indiana, for its 75.5 percent ""averaged freshman graduation rate."" New Jersey led the nation with an 87 percent rate. Those rates were calculated, according to the NCES,  by dividing the number of high school students who graduated with a regular high school diploma that year by the average of three enrollments: Grade 8 enrollment five years earlier, Grade 9 enrollment four years earlier and Grade 10 enrollment three years earlier Our search of the center’s website led us to an October 2005 report showing averaged freshman graduation rates in 2001-02, Perry’s cited year. Texas then landed 28th among the states, we found, with a 73.5 percent rate. New Jersey led nationally with an 85.8 percent rate. The report’s introduction touched on how this measurement differs from those that track each student individually, stating that while the averaged freshman graduation rate is not as accurate, it ""can be computed with currently available data."" 2011-12 In 2011-12, the latest year of available data, Texas ranked 22nd nationally in its averaged freshman graduation rate, according to a center chart. The 82 percent rate tied the rates for California, Colorado, Illinois and Kentucky. Vermont and Nebraska tied for first with 93 percent rates. So by this gauge, Texas went from 28th nationally in 2002 to tied for 22nd in 2012. Misleading? We wondered if it mattered that Perry echoed rankings rooted in different calculations. To our inquiries, experts told us his statement was misleading. Grover Whitehurst, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, emailed: ""Perry should have used the same measure to compare graduation rates across the years in question rather than one measure for the beginning year and another measure for the ending year. His statement is misleading."" Whitehurst agreed the yardstick placing Texas third in 2012-13 wasn’t available in 2002. ""It is quite possible to switch measures when discussing different points on the trend line, as the governor did, because of confusion rather than intentional cherry picking of the numbers that make the progress in Texas look best,"" he wrote. The NCES, he said, publishes ""dueling statistics on graduation and completion rates in such a way that a casual reader can easily make the mistake of comparing incommensurate measures.""    By phone, Walt Haney, a retired Boston College professor, called Perry’s dual-method comparison ""potentially extremely misleading. It’s based on different metrics."" Haney said it would have been more meaningful to air the state’s rank in 2002 and 2012 by the been-around-longer ""averaged freshman graduation rate"" indicator. Likewise, Rob Warren, a University of Minnesota sociologist, said Perry tapped incompatible metrics. ""On the only metric for which you have measurements over time,  there has been little change,"" Warren said by email. ""I infer that not much has changed."" Broadly, Warren said by phone, he also doubts the averaged freshman graduation rate indicator delivers accurate state-to-state comparisons. He said that’s because each state has leeway to define what goes into the rate calculations. Of note, he said, is whether a state as a whole holds back a lot of ninth-grade students. If so, the related graduation rate calculation will distort actual results--to the detriment of the state’s standing. Perry’s claim misleads, Warren said, because the 2013 and 2002 percentages don’t measure the same thing. ""So you may be higher on one, lower on the other, that doesn’t tell you which one is right. They have similar names, purport to measure similar things, but they’re not the same thing,"" he said. Our ruling Perry said: ""Texas’ high school graduation rate went from 27th in the country in 2002, to 2nd highest in the country in 2013."" Texas graduation rates improved while Perry was governor. But this comparison evidently jammed together results reached by different calculations--a statistical no-no leaving the misimpression that Texas galloped past many states on Perry’s watch. It looks to us like Texas actually moved from about 27th nationally in 2002 to tied for 22nd in 2012, according to a measure that compares graduates each year to tallies of students earlier enrolled in lower grades. By a newer gauge tied to tracking individual students, Texas in 2013 tied for third (not No. 2). We rate this claim Mostly False. MOSTLY FALSE – The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.
