Palin exaggerates status, cost of pipeline
","
In the vice presidential debate, Gov. Sarah Palin repeated claims she has made from time to time  about a plan to build a natural gas pipeline in Alaska.
 
After arguing the wisdom of the chant, ""Drill, baby, drill"" — heard frequently at McCain-Palin rallies — she followed up with this:
 
""Even in my own energy-producing state we have billions of barrels of oil and hundreds of trillions of cubic feet of clean, green natural gas. And we're building a nearly $40-billion natural gas pipeline — which is North America's largest and most expensive infrastructure project ever — to flow those sources of energy into hungry markets.""
 
It certainly would be something to boast about if Alaska had started building a natural gas pipeline under Palin. The state has been trying to get a pipeline built from its natural gas-rich North Slope for some three decades.
 
But her claim is premature. We've scrutinized her claims on the pipeline before (see

our review of her claim about the cost here

 and

a look at the status of the project here

) and found them less than accurate.
 
Palin did spearhead a plan under which TransCanada Corp., a Canadian company, will get $500-million in state funds to design and seek approvals for the pipeline. But they are not obligated to build it. Financing and approvals are far from certain, and the company can back out even if those contingencies come through.
 
TransCanada does not anticipate construction beginning until at least 2015, and several experts we spoke to were skeptical that the company's plan would come to fruition.
 
""I'll believe it when I see it,"" said Sarah Ladislaw, a fellow specializing in Western Hemispheric energy issues at the Center for Strategic & International Studies.
 
Palin has repeatedly mischaracterized the agreement with TransCanada. In a news conference in Alaska on Aug. 1, 2008, she said the state never before had ""commitments to build this line. Now we do.""
 
In its news story the next day, the

Anchorage Daily News

wrote: ""That's incorrect. TransCanada has not promised to actually build the gas line, one of the state's grandest and most frustrated economic development dreams.""
 
Now what about Palin's claim that the pipeline would cost ""nearly $40-billion""? We're not sure where she got that figure — neither her office in Alaska nor the McCain campaign has ever returned our calls to tell us. TransCanada estimates the cost at $26-billion.
 
Yes, there could be cost overruns. But experts were skeptical the price could reach Palin's estimate.
 
Palin was certainly wrong that the pipeline would be the ""most expensive infrastructure project ever."" What we suspect she meant to say — and has said repeatedly in the past — is that it would be the most expensive

privately funded

infrastructure project ever.
 
But she's probably wrong on that count, too. We talked to several experts in pipelines and large-scale engineering projects, who said the only private infrastructure project on the scale of Palin's proposed pipeline was the Trans-Alaska Pipeline System, an oil pipeline also from the North Slope that is often referred to as the Alaska Pipeline. The Alaska Pipeline was completed in 1977 at a cost of $8-billion. In 2007 dollars that would be just over $27-billion, edging out Palin's proposed natural gas pipeline.
 
While there are plans on the drawing board to build a pipeline, and Palin moved them forward in certain respects as governor, her claim in the debate suggests construction is underway, when that's not true. And she overstated the estimated cost of the project. We find her claim to be False.

McCain and Biden agree on military matters? Barely, not adamantly
","
During the vice presidential debate in St. Louis, Gov. Sarah Palin claimed that before the presidential campaign, Sen. Joe Biden agreed more with Sen. John McCain than with Sen. Barack Obama on military matters.
 
Her claim came during a discussion of the Iraq war.
 
""You're one who says, as so many politicians do, I was for it before I was against it or vice-versa,"" Palin said during the Oct. 2, 2008, debate. ""Americans are craving that straight talk and just want to know, hey, if you voted for it, tell us why you voted for it and it was a war resolution.
 
""And you had supported John McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had opposed very adamantly Barack Obama's military strategy, including cutting off funding for the troops — that attempt all through the primary.""
 
Palin was correct to say that both Biden and McCain voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2002, and voted for a military-funding bill that Obama opposed in 2007.
 
But was she right to state broadly that Biden ""supported McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly""?
 
First let's look closely at just how adamant Biden and McCain were about voting for the Iraq war resolution.
 
McCain was a strong supporter of granting Bush broad authority to invade pre-emptively. ""The president has spoken clearly of the threat Saddam Hussein's regime poses to America and the world today,"" he said in the Senate on Oct. 10, 2002, the day before the vote. ""In this new era, preventive action to target rogue regimes is not only imaginable but necessary ... In the new era we entered last September, warning of an attack before it happens is a luxury we cannot expect.""
 
By contrast, Biden was a reluctant supporter of the resolution.
 
Before it was approved, he and Sen. Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican, offered an unsuccessful alternative resolution narrowing the goal of American military action to disarming Iraq of weapons of mass destruction, and emphasizing multinational support for any military action.
 
When Biden did vote for the resolution, he voiced misgivings.
 
""I find myself supporting this resolution but worried that supporting this resolution will get us into real trouble,"" he said in the Senate on Oct. 10, 2002. ""I hope we don't walk out of here with my voting for this final document and somebody six months from now or six years from now will say we have the right now to establish this new doctrine of pre-emption and go wherever we want anytime.""
 
So he did not support McCain's position on the war resolution ""pretty adamantly."" More like pretty reluctantly.
 
The other example to which Palin referred of Biden siding with McCain rather than Obama was their vote in favor of a military funding bill on May 24, 2007. Obama voted against the measure because it did not include a timetable for withdrawal from Iraq.
 
Here's what Biden said about his vote on CNN on May 27, 2007: ""I'm not going to use the troops as a pawn in this game...I've worked very hard...on getting these new mine-resistant vehicles into the field, which will cut casualties by two-thirds...We delay this funding, it kicks down the road another two to three months before these vehicles get on the road.""
 
That's pretty adamant.
 
But there's a major area of military strategy on which Biden and McCain have not agreed: the surge.
 
McCain pushed for an influx of troops to Iraq for several years before Bush finally adopted the strategy in early 2007. For that reason, it is the military strategy most closely associated with McCain.
 
But Biden spoke out against it forcefully.
 
On

Meet the Press

on Jan. 7, 2007, Biden said a surge would be ""a tragic mistake.""
 
In April 2007, he told the

Washington Post

the surge would not succeed. He even singled out McCain as misguided. ""Assume the surge worked, then what?"" he told the

Post

. ""Stay there forever?""
 
So Biden ""supported McCain's military strategies pretty adamantly,"" as Palin claimed, only when it came to military funding. He voted to authorize the war, but his reluctance stood in stark contrast to McCain's zeal. And he and McCain were utterly at odds on the surge. We find Palin's claim to be Barely True.

"['National', 'Foreign Policy', 'Joe Biden']","
McCain refused to commit
","
During the vice presidential debate in St. Louis, Joe Biden argued for a vigorous diplomacy and attacked John McCain's approach to foreign policy.
 
""John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now. I find that incredible,"" Biden said.
 
Biden was referring to an interview McCain gave with Radio Caracol in Miami on Sept. 17 in which McCain was asked if he would invite José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero, the Spanish prime minister, to the White House.
 
McCain's tangled and somewhat confused response prompted lots of criticism. Democrats said it illustrated reluctance by the Bush administration — and now McCain — to engage in diplomacy even with longtime allies.
 
Here's the relevant portion of the interview:
 
Q: Senator, finally, let’s talk about Spain. If you’re elected president, would you be willing to invite President José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero to the White House, to meet with you?
 
A: I would be willing to meet with those leaders who are our friends and want to work with us in a cooperative fashion. And by the way, President Calderón of Mexico is fighting a very, very tough fight against the drug cartels. I’m glad we’re now working in cooperation with the Mexican government on the Merida plan, and I intend to move forward with the relations and invite as many of them as I can of those leaders to the White House.
 
Q: Would that invitation be extended to the Zapatero government? To the president, itself?
 
A: Uh, I don’t, you know, honestly, I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities, but I can assure you: I will establish closer relations with our friends, and I will stand up  to those who want to do harm to the United States of America. I know how to do both.
 
Q: So, you have to wait and see if he’s willing to, to meet with you, or you be… able to do it? In the White House?
 
A: Well, again… I, I don’t… All I can tell you is that I have a clear record of working with leaders in the hemisphere that are friends with us, and standing up to those who are not, and that’s judged on the basis of the importance of our relationship with Latin America, and the entire region.
 
Q: OK, what about Europe? I’m talking about the President of Spain. Are you willing to meet with him, if you’re elected president?
 
A: I’m willing to meet with any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are for human rights, democracy and freedom. And I will stand up to those that do not.
 
McCain's reluctance to meet with Zapatero was odd because Spain is a member of NATO and a longtime U.S. ally. The CIA World Factbook calls it ""a global champion of freedom."" The U.S. State Department says ""Spain and the United States have a long history of official relations and are closely associated in many fields.""
 
But it's worth noting that U.S.-Spain relations have suffered since Zapatero became prime minister in 2004 and withdrew Spanish troops that were helping the U.S. war in Iraq.
 
We listened to the McCain interview several times and got the impression that the senator was confused during the first few questions. The interviewer says Zapatero's name quickly and it seemed to us that McCain did not recognize the name. His answer suggests he is focused on other leaders from Latin America. But the interviewer seems to notice his confusion and reminds him ""OK, what about Europe? I’m talking about the president of Spain.""
 
But McCain's reply does not suggest that registered with him and he offers a more general reply about meeting with ""any leader who is dedicated to the same principles and philosophy that we are.""
 
We would have accepted a McCain-was-confused explanation for this one, but when the issue first came up during the campaign, the McCain campaign sent reporters a statement from foreign policy adviser Randy Scheunemann that said McCain's answer was intentional.
 
""The questioner asked several times about Senator McCain's willingness to meet Zapatero — and id'd him in the question so there is no doubt Senator McCain knew exactly to whom the question referred. Senator McCain refused to commit to a White House meeting with President Zapatero in this interview,"" Scheunemann said in an e-mail sent to the

Washington Post

and CNN.
 
Scheunemann said that if elected, McCain ""will meet with a wide range of allies in a wide variety of venues but is not going to spell out scheduling and meeting location specifics in advance.""
 
To us, McCain seemed confused. But Scheunemann's statement is adamant that McCain knew the subject was Spain. As a result, his comment that ""I have to look at the relations and the situations and the priorities"" indicates at least some doubt about U.S.-Spanish relations.
 
Which bring us back to Biden's statement. Biden said, ""John McCain said as recently as a couple of weeks ago he wouldn't even sit down with the government of Spain, a NATO ally that has troops in Afghanistan with us now."" Our reading of the interview is that McCain won't commit himself in advance to meeting or not meeting with the government of Spain. That's very different from refusing to meet with Spain.
 
Biden could have criticized McCain for that noncommittal stance and been more accurate. But instead Biden took it a step further and said McCain refused outright to meet with Spain. We rate Biden's statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'Sarah Palin']","
Obama's plan does not call for government-run health care
","
At the vice presidential debate in St. Louis, Sarah Palin defended John McCain's health care plan and criticized Barack Obama's.
 
Obama has a plan ""to mandate health care coverage and have a universal government-run program,"" Palin said. ""And unless you're pleased with the way the federal government has been running anything lately, I don't think that it's going to be real pleasing for Americans to consider health care being taken over by the feds.""
 
Problem is, Obama's plan keeps the free-market health care system intact, particularly employer-based insurance. It is not a goverment-run program and is very different from the health care systems run by the government in some European countries.
 
Obama's plan essentially takes the health care system as it is today and seeks to expand it to the uninsured. The plan increases eligibility for the poor and children to enroll in initiatives like Medicaid and the State Children’s Health Insurance Program. It also creates pools for individuals to buy their own cheaper insurance. And it outlines several strategies aimed at reining in costs for everyone, such as streamlining medical record-keeping and emphasizing preventive care.
 
Obama's plan does not mandate coverage, except for children. Obama said often during the Democratic primary campaign that he did not include a mandate for adults so as not to penalize people with modest incomes.
 
His reasoning for not including a mandate for adults was this: If premiums don’t drop enough after his reforms are implemented, people will still be unable to afford insurance. If a law mandates they buy it anyway, they probably won’t. Obama’s argument is that if you then fine them, you’re essentially punishing the poor — and they will still be uninsured. Obama said he hopes his plan will lower costs enough that many of the estimated 47-million uninsured will sign up without a mandate, and a mandate will come later.
 
Obama has said he would like it to be universal, in that everyone has health care coverage.
 
So Palin is mostly wrong about Obama's plan having a mandate; it only has one for children. He would like it to be universal at some point. She also emphasized that Obama proposes government-run health care, a statement that is completely inaccurate. Taking all that together, we rate her statement Barely True.

McCain's tax plan doesn't ignore middle class
","
 
In the much-anticipated vice presidential debate, Sen. Joe Biden and Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin sparred  over distribution of the tax burden under the tax plans proposed by the top of their tickets.
 
Biden picked up a refrain hammered by his running mate, Sen. Barack Obama, saying that Obama’s plan would provide more relief for the middle class. Biden would have been on solid footing had he stopped there, but he went one step further, claiming Sen. John McCain’s plan has nothing for the middle class.
 
""The economic engine of America is middle class,"" Biden said. ""It’s the people listening to this broadcast. When you do well, America does well. Even the wealthy do well. This is not punitive. John wants to add $300-million, billion in new tax cuts per year for corporate America and the very wealthy while giving virtually nothing to the middle class. We have a different value set. The middle class is the economic engine. It’s fair. They deserve the tax breaks, not the superwealthy who are doing pretty well. They don’t need any more tax breaks.""
 
Though independent analyses of the income tax provisions have generally concluded McCain’s plan would most benefit wealthy Americans, his plan does have provisions that would help individuals with lower household incomes.
 
Chief among these is a proposed increase to the exemption taxpayers may claim for each dependent — currently $3,500 — by $500 each year beginning in 2010 until it would reach $7,000 in 2016, after which it would be indexed for inflation. Under the McCain plan, married couples that file a joint return reporting adjusted gross income of $50,000 or less would be eligible for the $7,000 exemption immediately. So clearly, middle- and lower-income households with children would receive above-average tax cuts.
 
McCain also would raise and index for inflation the threshold for the alternative minimum tax, or AMT, a separate income tax that was intended to ensure that people did not use loopholes to avoid paying taxes but that has been ensnaring more and more middle-income Americans. Congress in recent years has extended the AMT exemption for a year or two at a time so that large numbers of taxpayers don’t become subject to the tax.
 
Congress is almost certain to enact another temporary ""patch"" covering the 2008 tax year. But McCain would permanently extend the AMT exemption, index it for inflation and allow individuals to claim personal nonrefundable credits against the AMT. How much this would help middle-class families largely depends on how you define middle class. The Tax Policy Center says it would primarily benefit more affluent households in the 80th to 95th percentile of income — those earning between $111,645 and $226,918 in 2008 dollars, were McCain’s plan to be fully phased in next year. Still, households with more modest means would not be subjected to the AMT under McCain’s proposal.
 
McCain would also extend President Bush’s 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, currently set to expire at the end of 2010. Those cuts collectively reduced top marginal tax rates on individuals’ incomes, cut the rates on capital gains and dividends, expanded the child tax credit and reduced taxes on married couples compared to singles.
 
The Tax Policy Center says McCain’s policy proposals collectively would reduce the tax exposure of 60 percent of all American households, though fewer than half of those making between $18,981 and $37,595.
 
But for the middle 20 percent of taxpayers — people making between $37,595 and $66,354 — here’s how the Tax Policy Center sees the respective tax plans shake out: Under McCain’s plan, their tax bill would go down by $325 in 2009, on average, and $1,118 under Obama’s plan. If you look down the road to 2012, those in the middle quintile would see tax cuts of $1,441 under McCain’s plan and $2,197 under Obama’s.
 
The analysis backs up Obama’s broad contention that McCain’s tax policy is weighted to give the largest benefit to higher-income taxpayers. However, it’s wrong to say McCain’s plan would provide no relief to middle-class Americans. Its more generous exemption for dependents and lower tax rates would cut across income levels and reduce or eliminate many taxpayers’ AMT exposure. For this reason, we rule the Biden’s comment Barely True.

Yup, Obama votes with the D's
","
In the vice presidential debate in St. Louis, Republican Gov. Sarah Palin tried to take a hammer to Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama’s postpartisan campaign tack.
 
“Now, Barack Obama, of course, he’s pretty much only voted along his party lines. In fact, 96 percent of his votes have been solely along party line,” Palin said, questioning whether he could reduce polarization in Washington.
 
In fact, Obama — who joined the Senate in 2005 — has voted with his party 96 percent of the time, according to a study by

Congressional Quarterly

. CQ’s calculation of party unity measures how often members vote with their party on bills where the parties split. By comparison, rival Sen. John McCain has voted with his fellow Republicans at an 81 percent clip over the entire Bush presidency.
 
But as PolitiFact has reported

before

, voting studies can be skewed depending on a lot of factors, such as attendance, the roll-call votes picked and the issues that arise during the course of the year. Some congressional sessions may have more head-to-head party line votes than others.
 
Examining votes that matched the position of President Bush — the titular head of the GOP — shows McCain has supported him 90 percent of the time, while Obama has gone along 40 percent, CQ found.
 
But the question here is if it's true that Obama voted along party lines 96 percent of the time, and that claim is True.

Biden more or less right on McCain's subprime surprise
","
On two occasions in the vice presidential debate, Sen. Joe Biden alleged that Sen. John McCain said some time ago that the mortgage crisis had taken him by surprise.
 
""Two years ago Barack Obama warned about the subprime mortgage crisis,"" Biden said early in the Oct. 2, 2008, debate. ""John McCain said shortly after that in December he was surprised there was a subprime mortgage problem.""
 
Then a few minutes later Biden said: ""John McCain said as early as last December, quote – I'm paraphrasing – 'I'm surprised about this subprime mortgage crisis.'""
 
This was likely an attempt to mute McCain and Gov. Sarah Palin's recent touting of McCain's advocacy in 2006 for stricter oversight of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the federally sponsored mortgage companies. McCain has cited that position to suggest he saw the mortgage crisis coming. (Indeed McCain did support more oversight of Fannie and Freddie, as we reported

here

.)
 
But is it true that McCain said he was ""surprised"" at the mortgage crisis?
 
We believe Biden was referring to McCain's remarks in

this interview

with the editorial board of the

Keene Sentinel

, a newspaper in New Hampshire, on Nov. 4, 2007.
 
Turning to the subject of the mortgage crisis, one of the journalists asked him: ""The dimension of this problem may be surprising to a lot of people, but to many people, many others, there were feelings that there was something amiss, something was going too fast, something was a little too hot, going back several years. Were you one of them? Or, you're a busy guy, you're looking at a lot of things, maybe subprime mortgages wasn't something you focused on every day. Were you surprised?""
 
McCain: ""Yeah. And I was surprised at the dot-com collapse, and I was surprised at other times in our history – I don't know if 'surprised' is the word, but –""
 
Question: ""S&L's?""
 
McCain: ""Yeah the S&L –""
 
Question: ""Is this bigger than that?""
 
McCain: ""You know, I don't know the dimensions of this. It's hard to know what the dimensions of it are. As I say, I never thought I'd pick up the paper and see a city in Norway somehow dramatically impacted by it. When I say 'surprised,' uh, I'm not surprised when in capitalist systems that there's greed and excess. I think it was Teddy Roosevelt who said unfettered capitalism leads to corruption or something like that...""
 
McCain went on to say that a handful of people, including an adviser of his, Doug Holtz-Eakin, did sense something amiss in the economy. But he concluded with this: ""I'd like to tell you I did anticipate it, but I have to give you straight talk, I did not.""
 
So yes, McCain said the mortgage crisis surprised him. And he concluded by acknowledging flat-out that he did not anticipate the crisis. So there is certainly truth to Biden's accusation.
 
But McCain also said he didn't know if 'surprised' was the word. And he issued a blanket caveat about how greed and excess among capitalists never surprised him. So the context undermines Biden's claim a bit. (Not to mention that Biden flubbed the month that McCain made his comments.) We give Biden a Mostly True.

A clean hit? Not quite
","
""Clean coal,"" the promising yet distant ideal of burning coal for electricity without releasing harmful pollution, appeals to just about everybody.
 
Yet a new radio advertisement by Sen. John McCain's campaign, targeted to the coal-rich states of Colorado, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia, alleges that Sen. Barack Obama opposes it.
 
""Clean coal is important to America. And to Colorado/Ohio/Pennsylvania/Virginia,"" the ad says, tailoring the narration to the state. ""For [residents of that state], coal means thousands of jobs. Economic growth. More affordable electricity. For America, coal means energy independence. And clean coal means cleaner air. But Obama-Biden and their liberal allies oppose clean coal. Listen to Joe Biden.""
 
The ad then replays part of 



an exchange

between Biden and a voter on a rope line in Maumee, Ohio, in on Sept. 17, 2008:
 
""Senator, wind and solar are flourishing here in Ohio, so why are you supporting clean coal?"" the voter asked.
 
""We're not supporting clean coal,"" Biden replied. ""Guess what, China is building two every week, two dirty coal plants, and it's polluting the United States, it's causing people to die.""
 
He touted his record on supporting solar energy and fighting global warming, then continued:
 
""But guess what, China's going to burn 300 years of bad coal unless we figure out how to clean their coal up, because it's going to ruin your lungs, and there's nothing we can do about it. No coal plants here in America. Build them if they're going to build them over there. Make them clean, because they're killing you.""
 
The phrase ""clean coal"" refers to a number of technologies, some in use and others early in the development stage, which would allow the burning of coal for energy without the harmful pollution that coal-fired power plants currently emit. Chief among them is ""carbon sequestration,"" a process by which the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide would be captured and injected underground or into the ocean, where it would not contribute to global warming. That is at least a decade or two away.
 
Strictly speaking, Biden's comments in Maumee were not evidence that he ""oppose[s] clean coal,"" as the ad claims – rather they suggest he opposes clean coal plants in the United States, but supports the idea of developing the technology here and providing it to China.
 
In fact, Biden himself has voiced support for clean coal, calling for ""carbon capture and sequestration technologies that will allow us to use coal cleanly"" in the



energy plan

he released during his presidential campaign in the autumn of 2007.
 
In a



statement

, Obama campaign spokesman David Wade explained Biden's comments this way: ""Senator Biden's point is that China is building coal plants with outdated technology every day, and the United States needs to lead by developing clean coal technologies.""
 
Moreover, Biden's remarks are far outweighed by the many instances in which Obama has spoken out in favor of clean coal, as our fellow fact-checkers at FactCheck.org



 pointed out recently

.
 
Here's Obama in his acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention in Denver on Aug. 28, 2008: ""As president, I will tap our natural gas reserves, invest in clean coal technology, and find ways to safely harness nuclear power.""
 
Here he is in Detroit, Mich., on May 7, 2007: ""We'll also need to find a way to use coal – America's most abundant fossil fuel – without adding harmful greenhouse gases to the environment.""
 
If there were any doubt that Obama supports the development of clean-coal plants in the United States specifically, the energy plan on his Web site makes that explicit: ""Barack Obama and Joe Biden will...develop and deploy clean coal technology. Carbon capture and storage technologies hold enormous potential to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions as we power our economy with domestically produced and secure energy...Barack Obama and Joe Biden will instruct DOE (the Department of Energy) to enter into public private partnerships to develop “first-of-a-kind” commercial scale coal-fired plants with carbon capture and sequestration.""
 
So no, Obama and his ""liberal allies"" do not oppose clean coal. Nor does Biden, unless you interpret comments he made off the cuff on a rope line overly broadly, and give them more credence than the energy plan he developed during his presidential campaign. We find McCain's claim to be False.

Palin supports aerial shooting, for a reason
","
Produced by the political arm of the Defenders of Wildlife Action, a new television ad takes aim at Sarah Palin’s position on wildlife issues. The minute-long video starts by juxtaposing Palin’s darkened picture with majestic images of a bear and a wolf, while an announcer talks about her support for an aerial predator-control program.
 
""The more voters learn about Sarah Palin, the less there is to like. As Alaska governor, Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife,"" the narrator says.
 
""Using a low-flying plane, they kill in winter, when there is no way to escape. Riddled with gunshots, biting at their backs in agony, they die a brutal death. And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf. And then introduced a bill to make the killing easier,"" the narrator says. ""Do we really want a vice president who champions such savagery?""
 
The ad shows grisly video footage: low-flying aircraft with gunners leaning out the door shooting wolves and bears from the air. The plane later lands and the shooter finalizes the kill. In one picture, a wolf’s carcass hangs from one of the plane’s wing braces.
 
For this item, we'll focus on the claim that Palin promotes ""aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife.""
 
Palin’s record on the issue is actually quite clear. As a candidate, and as governor, the Republican has endorsed wildlife management practices that include the controversial use of airplanes to thin out predator populations.
 
But in Alaska, frontier politics look different than they do in the Lower 48. Alaska has vast populations of wolves, bears, caribou and moose, and sportsmen who hunt and sometimes live off those species.
 
“If I am elected, I don’t want you to be surprised that I am a proponent of predator control in order to build those populations of moose and caribou,” Palin said, according to news reports from a gubernatorial debate in 2006.
 
Alaska state officials take issue with the use of the phrase “aerial hunting,” preferring “aerial shooting.”
 
“The predator-control program that we do — that isn’t hunting and we never claimed it is,” said Tim Barry, spokesman for the Alaska Department of Fish & Game. “It deliberately gives hunters an unfair advantage. That’s what we want.”
 
It’s tougher to assess the ad’s subjective assessment that such practices are “brutal and unethical,” though many wildlife groups would agree. Defenders of Wildlife has filed lawsuits challenging Alaska’s wildlife management practices. President Rodger Schlickeisen said his group takes the view that any killing of animals, outside of a biological emergency, is unwarranted. In September 2007, more than 120 scientists signed a letter to Palin that questioned the biological basis for the state’s intensive predator management.
 
Aerial hunting has been banned since 1972 in every state but Alaska, which gets around the federal law by claiming that predator population control is more important.
 
The ad is missing an important note of context. Unlike other areas around the United States where wolf populations are smaller, Alaska officials count between 7,000 and 11,000 in the state. Wolf populations are managed in five parts of the state as part of a program that began in 2003 under former Gov. Frank Murkowski.
 
In 2007, Palin’s administration proposed enhancements to encourage hunters to kill more wolves when it became clear that not enough wolves were being taken out of the population to meet the state’s goal for the year. Palin’s office announced a plan to pay hunters $150 for each wolf killed with the money to be paid when hunters turned in the left foreleg of dead wolves to state biologists. The program was axed by a judge who ruled it an improper bounty on wildlife.
 
“I have said many times that my administration is committed to management of game for abundance, and to a proactive, science-based predator management program where appropriate,” the governor said in a news release at the time.
 
We find her actions are adequate to support the statement that she promotes aerial shooting. But the environmental group’s categorization of the program is debatable and not putting it within the context of a state predator management program is a bit misleading. We find the claim is True.

Another Truth-O-Meter vs. Spend-O-Meter smackdown
","
Tweaking a line of attack it first employed in February, the Republican National Committee is charging that Americans would have to finance $1-trillion of new spending if Barack Obama fulfills all of his campaign promises over one term in the White House.

 

And that’s above and beyond whatever the government decides to spend bailing out the financial system.

 

A new RNC ad called “Worse,” unveiled Sept. 30, 2008, references the calamity gripping the financial markets and the taxpayer-funded bailout now under consideration in Congress, then contends Obama’s agenda would unleash geysers of additional red ink.

 

“Wall Street squanders our money and Washington is forced to bail them out with – you guessed it – our money,” an announcer says. “Can it get any worse? Under Barack Obama’s plan, the government would spend a trillion dollars more – even after the bailout.”

 

The ad has its genesis in a graphical device called the “Spend-O-Meter” that the RNC featured on its Web site during the primary season in an effort to depict both Obama and Hillary Rodham Clinton as tax-and-spend liberals.

We’ve already ruled

on its February claim that Obama wanted to spend $874-billion during his first term in office, concluding that the Republicans correctly identified about half of the Illinois senator’s proposals as new spending and made some highly creative assumptions about the rest.

 

But how did the total balloon to the current $1-trillion? The biggest change is Republicans have revised upward their claim on how much Obama’s health care plan would cost. Obama wants to mandate that employers either offer health coverage or pay a sum equal to a percentage of their payrolls to fund a new national insurance plan. His campaign says this so-called “play or pay” approach would result in $50-billion to $65-billion in new costs to the government.

 

The RNC, on the other hand, contends the plan would cost $150-billion a year, or $600-billion over four years, and bases its estimate on a Sept. 17 interview Obama gave

60 Minutes

. (In February, the Republicans incorporated the Obama campaign’s high-end estimate of $65-billion a year, or $260-billion over four years, in their tally.)

 

Here’s Obama’s exchange with

60 Minutes

correspondent Steve Kroft:

 

Kroft: “How much is it going to cost? $150-billion, right?”

 

Obama: “It is. It is. But we pay for every dime that we propose to spend … Roughly speaking, I believe in pay-as-you-go. That if you want to propose a new program, you better cut some old ones. If you want to expand a program, then you better figure out where the money’s coming from.”

 

It’s not clear to us why Obama agreed with Kroft’s figure when it contradicts his campaign’s own estimate. Regardless, it’s difficult to forecast with any accuracy what such an initiative would cost, in part because Obama’s campaign has yet to flesh out many details. The RNC makes the highly unlikely assumption that the health care plan would go into effect as soon as Obama takes office. And it doesn’t factor Obama’s companion proposal to cover much of the new cost by allowing President Bush’s tax cuts on dividends and capital gains for individuals making more than $200,000 a year to expire in 2010.

 

An analysis of Obama’s plan by a group of conservative-leaning health policy experts in the Sept. 16 issue of the journal

Health Affairs

puts the likely cost at approximately $100-billion annually. The figure is based on cost projections of a proposal released by the nonpartisan Commonwealth Fund that shares certain features with Obama’s plan, including a mandate for employer-sponsored insurance. However, Commonwealth Fund president Karen Davis says the comparison is strained, because unlike her organization’s blueprint, the Obama plan doesn’t explicitly require adults to have health insurance. Davis added that Obama campaign also hasn’t specified eligibility criteria or the size of subsidies that would come from Medicaid and the federal State Children’s Health Insurance Program, both of which provide assistance to low-income Americans.

 

So the Obama health plan remains something of a Rorschach test – an expensive big-government mandate to its critics, a fiscally responsible exercise in strengthening the social safety net to supporters. Call it what you want, but it’s almost pointless to attach a price tag until the Obama camp more clearly spells out its intentions. And the

60 Minutes

interview seems like weak evidence, absent any change in policy, on which to hang an additional $340-billion spending claim.
 
The next biggest item on the list is $156-billion to expand the Medicare Part D prescription drug program. Obama has said he wants to fix a ""doughnut hole"" in the program that leaves some mid-range drug prescription costs uncovered. The RNC doesn't mention that Obama proposes to pay for that with cost-saving measures, such as allowing the federal government to negotiate directly with pharmaceutical companies in setting Medicare drug prices. The campaign said it wouldn't close the doughnut hole if it couldn't find cuts to pay for it.
 
Some of the Obama campaign's proposals and cost projections cited on the Republicans’ tally continue to be correctly categorized as new spending, in one form or another. They include:
 
Even Obama acknowledges uncertainty about his proposals given the downturn in the economy and the cost of the financial bailout. In the first presidential debate on Sept. 26, 2008, he said, ""There's no doubt that we're not going to be able to do everything that I think needs to be done.""
 
But overall, the Spend-O-Meter hasn’t improved its batting average since February. We rule the Republicans’ $1-trillion claim: Half True.

Palin endorsed wolf bounty
","
In a jarring television advertisement, the Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund attempts to show a less friendly side of vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin by noting how the Alaska governor championed an intensive predator management program.
 
""The more voters learn about Sarah Palin, the less there is to like. As Alaska governor, Sarah Palin actively promotes the brutal and unethical aerial hunting of wolves and other wildlife,"" the narrator says.
 
""Using a low-flying plane, they kill in winter, when there is no way to escape. Riddled with gunshots, biting at their backs in agony, they die a brutal death. And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf. And then introduced a bill to make the killing easier,"" the narrator says. ""Do we really want a vice president who champions such savagery?""
 
For this item, we'll focus on this part of the ad: “And Palin even encouraged the cruelty by proposing a $150 bounty for the severed foreleg of each killed wolf.”
 
“The cruelty” in question was a state-sanctioned hunt intended to thin out the wolf population. Indeed, Palin’s administration announced the $150 bounty for the “left forelegs of wolves” as part of a larger effort to reduce wolf populations in five areas of the state, according to a press release from the Alaska Department of Fish & Game dated March 21, 2007. The payments are made to volunteer pilots and shooters who are permitted to track and kill predators in the winter months. State biologists planned to use the forelegs as specimens to study the wolf population.
 
Department spokesman Tim Barry said the idea came from state biologists and Palin’s office played a key role in developing the cash incentive program. Proposals of this nature ultimately are approved by the state’s Board of Game, which is appointed by the governor’s office.
 
The release contends the payment isn’t a “bounty,” but that’s a matter of semantics. An Alaskan judge who later declared the payments illegal called it a “bounty, pure and simple” in his ruling. In fact, the Defenders of Wildlife Action, which made this ad, was among the conservation groups that took Alaska to court over the incentive program.
 
What’s missing from the campaign ad is the context about wildlife management in Alaska, and the history of the program.
 
Unlike other areas where wolves are protected, Alaska officials estimate the state’s vast wilderness holds 7,000 to 11,000 wolves. These elusive predators hunt moose and caribou, which are favorite targets for hunters seeking food and sport in Alaska. In 2003, then-Gov. Frank Murkowski initiated the program to manage the wolf population.
 
In 2007, the state wanted to kill between 382 and 664 wolves, but the nearly 200 permitted hunters had shot only about 100 wolves as the hunting season neared its April 30 end. High fuel prices and limited snowfall made it hard to track the animals, so Palin’s administration offered the $150 per wolf as an extra incentive “to motivate permittees to redouble their efforts and to help offset the high cost of aviation fuel,” the release states.
 
The organization behind the ad, along with other environmental groups, filed a lawsuit to stop the payments because wildlife bounties were outlawed in 1984. About 40 wolves were killed after the bounty was offered, but the payments were never made to hunters. The judge struck down the incentive program 10 days after it was announced, Barry said. The advertisement is intended to shock viewers by presenting Palin without the context of political life in frontier Alaska, where wildlife management is a high-profile government function. But the facts are right and the missing context has more to do with sensibilities than factual accuracy. We rate the attack True.

Ad distorts McCain's record on Violence Against Women Act
","
A new ad from Planned Parenthood makes two charges against Sarah Palin and John McCain. It says Wasilla, Alaska, charged rape victims for forensic exams when Palin was mayor and that, as a senator, McCain ""voted to let governments charge rape victims"" for forensic exam kits.
 
We've examined the controversy over the Wasilla rape kit policy

in this previous article,

so here we'll examine the charge that McCain voted to let governments charge the victims.
 
The ad begins with a rape victim named Gretchen who says, ""I just didn’t think it would happen to me. I was drugged and raped.""
 
The announcer says, ""Under Mayor Sarah Palin, women like Gretchen were forced to pay up to $1,200 for the emergency exams used to prosecute their attackers."" The screen says ""Charged rape victims for exams - Source: CNN, September 22, 2008.""  (We reported earlier that

Gretchen is from Illinois, not Alaska

, and was not subject to the Wasilla policy.)
 
The announcer continues: ""In the Senate, John McCain voted against legislation to protect women from these same heartless policies"" while the screen says, ""Voted to let governments charge rape victims.""
 
Gretchen then says, ""That is something to me that’s unthinkable. It scares me to death.""
 
The screen attributes the McCain allegation to a vote on Aug. 25, 1994, on a crime bill that included the Violence Against Women Act, which itself included a provision that required states to provide free forensic exams for rape victims.
 
Planned Parenthood's logic: Because McCain opposed that bill, he voted to let governments charge victims for their rape kits.
 
That's quite a stretch.
 
Indeed, McCain voted that day against a conference report on the crime bill, but he opposed it not because of the Violence Against Women provisions, but because it included extra spending that McCain considered unrelated to crime and it had a provision that would have banned so-called assault weapons.
 
Nine months earlier, McCain had supported the original bill, which included the Violence Against Women Act, when it passed the Senate 95-4. So that alone is a significant contradiction of Planned Parenthood's claim.
 
Also, McCain has supported the Violence Against Women Act when it has come up for reauthorization.
 
In 2000, McCain joined a unanimous vote on a crime bill that included the Violence Against Women Act.
 
In 2005, he praised the law when he introduced a companion bill to provide protections for Indian women. ""The 1994 Violence Against Women Act has had a tremendous impact on raising the national awareness of domestic violence and providing communities, including Indian tribes, the resources to respond to the devastating impact of domestic violence,"" he said.
 
When we asked Planned Parenthood if it had any other evidence to bolster its claim, spokesman Tait Sye scrounged up a few more: a vote against a 2008 justice spending bill that included all justice programs (McCain opposed it because it had too many earmarks), and a couple of other votes that are not directly related to the rape provision of the Violence Against Women Act.
 
That's the best they got?
 
That's the classic kind of cherry-picking we've seen in campaign ads and it is flimsy evidence for the serious charge that McCain opposed the program, especially in light of his clear support at other times.
 
Planned Parenthood has virtually nothing to back up its charge that McCain voted to let states charge for rape exams. Sure, McCain voted against a larger crime bill in 1994, but that vote was about assault weapons and spending, not the Violence Against Women Act. And McCain has supported the law before then — and twice since.
 
Planned Parenthood's claim isn't just False, it's ridiculously so, which merits a Pants on Fire.

"['Health Care', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says $800 billion in taxes in health care law do not ""discriminate between rich and poor""
","
It’s not news that Republicans predict the health care overhaul will spell devastation for business. But Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., is taking it further. He warns the law will ""hurt everyone.""

""Obamacare is bad policy that adds around $800 billion of taxes on the American people,"" he wrote in a July 8 opinion-editorial in the Orlando Sentinel. ""It does not discriminate between rich and poor. It hurts everyone.""

We wondered where he got his $800 billion tax total, as well as the validity of the idea that the law does not ""discriminate between rich and poor."" So we decided to check it out.

$800 billion in new taxes?

Rubio pulled the figure from a 2011 report by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Office and Joint Committee on Taxation. It was commissioned by Republican House Speaker John Boehner to estimate the cost of repealing the health care law.

Repealing the law would result in $813 billion in lost revenues for the government between 2012 and 2021, the report found.

Where do those come from? To pay for the overhaul, the federal government created a series of  new revenue sources -- some are clearly taxes, some are changes to tax rules -- that include the controversial tax penalty for people who do not have their own health insurance and a tax on indoor tanning. (We looked at more than a dozen revenue sources and whether they were actually taxes in a January PolitiFact report.)

Whether each revenue source is technically a tax does not matter to Rubio. Here, he equates all money raised from Americans as a tax.

Also, Rubio’s number doesn’t account for the tax breaks that are in the law, especially the tax credits that some people of modest means will receive to help them buy insurance.

We consulted several experts, who disagreed on the best way to account for the law’s tax increases.

A couple experts said Rubio’s $800 billion figure is valid, even if it is out of date and does not account for billions in tax credits.

""It's just stating what the tax bill is,"" said Joseph Henchman, of the business-backed Tax Policy Foundation. ""Most people don't expect you to net out benefits.""

Not so fast, said Chapin White, a former CBO staffer who is now a senior health researcher at the Center for Studying Health System Change, a health research group founded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. White said it’s important to subtract the law’s $519 billion in refundable tax credits and subsidies for health insurance, among other things.

All told, the more appropriate net ""tax increase"" over 10 years is about $20 billion, he said.

No difference between rich and poor?

Rubio spokesman Alex Conant declined to elaborate on what Rubio meant when he said the law does not ""discriminate between rich and poor,"" saying he did not want to parse his words.

The best we can infer from Rubio’s claim and the context around it is the health care law affects the rich and the poor the same, tax-wise.

And that’s off base.

The point of the law was to expand health coverage to those who don’t have it -- including people who don't have jobs or have low income. To make that happen, the law provides tax credits to low- and moderate-income families, and it includes more taxes on the wealthy and an individual mandate requiring most Americans to obtain health insurance.

Two of the biggest taxes in the law are geared toward taxpayers with higher incomes. People whose incomes exceed $200,000 ($250,000 for couples filing jointly) will pay 0.9 percentage point more on Medicare payroll taxes in 2013. These people would also pay a new 3.8 percent tax on investment income.  

Plus, the law includes a 40 percent excise tax on people who have high-premium health insurance plans starting in 2018. Also known as ""Cadillac plans,"" these premiums are usually obtained by people in the middle- to upper- class, and are expected to bring in $111 billion through 2021.

Democrats, of course, take a different view than the Republicans. The Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate Finance Committee released a compilation of tax breaks available to individuals, middle-class families, and small businesses, thanks to the law. The total? $828 billion in ""tax cuts"" over 10 years.

Most of that comes from tax credits and subsidies for families with low- to moderate-level incomes. The law creates exchanges through which consumers can shop for the best plans. People who qualify can supplement the cost of an insurance plan with a government subsidy, which will be based on income.

A break is also extended to certain small businesses with low-income workers who employ fewer than 50 people and offer health insurance to them.

Now for the individual mandate, which requires most everyone to have health insurance in 2014 or pay a penalty to the Internal Revenue Service.

You could argue it doesn’t discriminate between rich and poor because it applies to most everyone. But the penalty is linked to income.

Individuals who go uninsured and who aren't exempt from the mandate will have to pay an annual penalty of at least $95 per adult in 2014, rising to $325 in 2015 and $695 in 2016. After 2016, the amount would be indexed to inflation and could be higher -- 2.5 percent of household income, if that’s greater than the amount written into the law.

The nonpartisan federal researchers at CBO and JCT have estimated that about 4 million uninsured Americans, including dependents, will have to pay up in 2016, amounting to $4 billion in revenue per year from 2017 to 2019.

Probably most relevant to our fact-check is the fact that the mandate includes a hardship exemption for people who cannot afford to buy health insurance.

Our ruling

Rubio cherry-picks the highest number he can find -- $800 billion in new taxes -- to garner opposition to the recently upheld health care law. He doesn’t tell readers anything more about the figure, including the fact that these ""taxes"" would be garnered over 10 years.

His statement also indicates that rich and poor people will feel the effects of the law’s various revenue-raising provisions with the same degree of pain. But that’s not true. The law taxes wealthier Americans to a greater degree to provide more services for the poor.

NH Democrats heap blame on Speaker Bill O'Brien and his Tea Party followers
","Apparently, Siri may not have all the answers.

In a Web advertisement mimicking ads for Apple’s new Siri digital assistant, the New Hampshire Democratic Party takes aim at House Speaker William O’Brien and his ""Tea Party legislature.""

""Bill O'Brien's Tea Party legislature tried to repeal kindergarten and compulsory education,"" the assistant tells the unnamed voter in the ad, ""College vs. Smokes.""

They tried to ""defund Planned Parenthood and eliminate insurance coverage for birth control. …  On November 6, we must vote this radical Tea Party majority out of office.""

Siri may know a lot of things, but does it know the ins and outs of the New Hampshire legislature? We decided to check the tape.

To get to the answer, we broke the claim down to four parts: the kindergarten charge, compulsory education, Planned Parenthood and insurance coverage for birth control. In its ad, the Democratic party points to specific pieces of legislation for each claim, so it wasn’t hard to connect the dots.

1)  Repeal kindergarten

To support its kindergarten claim, the Democrats point to H.B. 631, considered during the 2011 legislative session. As the ad claims, the bill, sponsored by state Rep. Jonathan Maltz, R-Hudson, did in fact propose to repeal the state mandate requiring school districts to provide kindergarten programs. It reads, ""This bill repeals the requirement that all school districts offer public kindergarten, and exempts those school districts that implemented a public kindergarten program … from the kindergarten construction grant repayment penalty.""

But, what the ad fails to mention is the bill failed to gain much traction in the House, either among Democrats or from O’Brien’s Republican majority.

Members of the House Education committee, made up of 13 Republicans and four Democrats, recommended killing the bill with a 12-3 vote, and once it reached the House floor Feb. 23, 2011, representatives voted 213-134 to shoot it down, including 126 of 260 Republicans who voted against the bill.

""This bill was introduced because of the questionable constitutional mandate of a couple of years ago. However, since every school district now has kindergarten, this bill would be superfluous,"" state Rep. Ralph Boehm, vice-chairman of the education committee, wrote in the committee’s recommendation.

We rate this part of the claim Mostly False.


2)  Repeal compulsory education

By the time it reached the House floor, the compulsory education bill didn’t do much to address compulsory education.

In its original form, H.B. 542 included provisions proposing to repeal attendance requirements in public schools. But, that proposal drew heavy criticism and the House Education committee amended the bill to focus on objectionable material in the classroom.

The amended bill, which allows parents to object to any course material and request alternative curriculum, passed the committee by a 12-6 vote and was eventually approved by the full House 197-148.

Gov. John Lynch vetoed the amended bill, but both the House and the Senate voted to override the Governor’s veto, and it became law Jan. 4, 2012.

As it stands now, the law makes no mention of compulsory education or attendance requirements. Legislators have promised to pursue the compulsory education matter in a separate, free standing bill.

So at this point, there is little evidence to back up the Democrats' claim. We rate this portion False.

3)  Defund Planned Parenthood

The Planned Parenthood part of the claim may be closer to the truth.

With H.B. 228, House Republicans voted in January to ban the use of taxpayer dollars to fund Planned Parenthood or other abortion providers.

The bill, sponsored by Robert Willette, R-Milford, initially earned a tough reception from the Health, Human Services and Elderly Affairs committee, which recommended killing the bill in a 12-5 vote. But, after then-Majority Leader D.J. Bettencourt asked his colleagues to delay a vote, O’Brien, the House Speaker, worked to shape an amendment that made the bill more palatable to House lawmakers.

On Jan. 18, 2012, the House approved the amendment, which proposed to allow hospitals to use public dollars to fund emergency abortions, and the full House reversed the committee’s recommendation and passed the bill by a 207-147 vote.

Two months later, the state Senate voted to lay the matter on the table, letting it die a polite death.

Still, the House Republicans voted in favor of de-funding Planned Parenthood, so this portion earns a True.


4)  Eliminate insurance coverage for birth control

Lastly, we get to the issue of insurance coverage for birth control.

H.B. 1546, the bill referenced in the ad, didn’t start as a birth control proposal. Initially, it intended to re-codify laws relating to religious groups, including membership, donation and corporate powers. But, after O’Brien and several other House Republicans reworked it, the bill provided an exemption for groups with religious objections from providing insurance coverage for birth control and contraception.

The amendment, which passed the House Constitutional Review and Statutory Recodification committee by a 10-6 vote, added language to the bill saying ""No employer shall be required to include in its coverage for its employees the provisions of this section if the employer has a religious objection.""

The amended bill then passed the full House in a 196-150 vote, led by the Republican leadership team.

""No religious intuition or employer should be forced to pay for services they find morally objectionable, and with this bill we will have paved the way on the state level,"" Bettencourt, the House Majority Leader, said at the time in a written statement.

The following month, the state Senate referred the bill to interim study, leading to its eventual death.

But, even if it had passed into law, the bill would not, as the Democratic Party suggests, eliminated insurance coverage for birth control. Instead, it would have allowed employers with religious objections to decline to include birth control under its health insurance plans.

That's a big difference from eliminating coverage for birth control, as the ad claimed. This portion gets a Mostly False.

Our ruling:

The state Democratic Party included many claims in this 110-second ad, and one of them is on track. Of the four included in this statement, the ad is spot on about O’Brien and the Republican Majority’s push to defund Planned Parenthood. But, the ad is off the mark in other areas. The proposal to repeal the kindergarten mandate got little support from either party and was ushered to a quick death; the push to do away with compulsory education was removed from the associated bill before it reached the House floor; and, finally, with the birth control bill, House Republicans sought to allow some employers to decline to include birth control in their insurance coverage, not to eliminate coverage entirely.

Of these charges, the Democratic Party is shooting 1-4. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jul/16/new-hampshire-democratic-party/nh-democrats-heap-blame-speaker-bill-obrien-and-hi/

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says prostitution money is helping fund groups backing Rep. Sean Duffy’s campaign
","
Democrats have freshman Republican Congressman Sean Duffy, R-Wisconsin, a former Ashland County district attorney, on their 2012 targets list.

That was especially evident when the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee unleashed a July 2, 2012 news release taking aim at Duffy’s campaign contributors.

The release begins: ""Foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Sean Duffy’s (WI-07) Republican Majority.""

Quite a claim. But hardly an original one.

The DCCC made an identical Chinese prostitution attack against Jim Renacci, a  Republican House member in Ohio. They also used it against Republican congressmen Scott DesJarlais in Tennessee and Jim Gerlach in Pennsylvania.

What’s behind this lurid campaign finance claim?

Our colleagues in PolitiFact Ohio dug into the issue after Renacci was targeted. Here’s what they found:

The charge is tied to billionaire casino owner Sheldon Adelson, who has donated millions to Republicans. A fired former employee of Adelson’s filed a lawsuit which alleges that Adelson personally approved of prostitution at properties his company owns in Macau, a former Portuguese colony near Hong Kong that now is part of China.

PolitiFact Ohio continued:

The DCCC release noted that Adelson and his wife gave $5 million to the Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, which is backed by House Speaker John Boehner and other GOP leaders. FEC records indicate that Super PAC hasn’t spent anything so far.

Adelson and his wife, Miriam, also gave more than $60,000 to the Republican counterpart of the DCCC, the National Republican Congressional Committee, during the past election cycle.

A spokesman for the Adelson’s company, Las Vegas Sands, issued a statement that said Adelson has always ""maintained a strong policy against prostitution on our properties and any accusation to the contrary represents a blatant and reprehensible personal attack on Mr. Adelson’s character.""

In a July 9 interview with Forbes magazine,  Adelson said there’s not a ""shred of evidence"" to back his former employee’s charges, and ""says the fact that he and his wife (a physician who specializes in treating addiction) have given millions of dollars to set up clinics around the world to treat people with drug addictions (many of them prostitutes) makes the … claims even more preposterous.""  Adelson also told the publication that promoting prostitution could cost him his gaming licenses in Las Vegas, Singapore and Macau.

The DCCC says  ""Adelson has given $5 million to Speaker (John) Boehner’s Congressional Leadership Fund Super PAC, pledged $5 million to Leader (Eric) Cantor’s Young Guns Network Super PAC, given $70,800 to the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC), and has committed at least $20 million into Karl Rove’s American Crossroads.""

So Adelson has contributed or pledged plenty of money to Republican candidates or committees. That’s clear. But the Chinese prostitution link is another matter.

Here’s how PolitiFact Ohio put it in their review of the claim against Renacci:

Do unproven charges by a disgruntled former Adelson employee coupled with Adelson’s generosity to GOP groups that are likely to back Renacci justify the DCCC’s claim that ""foreign Chinese prostitution money is allegedly behind the groups funding Congressman Jim Renacci’s Republican majority?""

We don’t think so.

Neither do we.

As our Ohio colleagues point out, the allegation that Adelson allowed prostitution at the Macau comes from a fired employee. The DCCC takes that claim and says money from prostitution was included in Adelson’s campaign contributions to GOP congressional incumbents -- including Duffy.

There’s no evidence that Duffy received contributions from Adelson, and he has no control over contributions to groups that support him.

Chris Christie claims New Jersey has reduced the number of state employees without any layoffs to below the level when Christie Whitman resigned
","
A fresh batch of labor statistics is sending a recycled claim from Gov. Chris Christie to the bottom end of the Truth-O-Meter.

The Republican governor last week repeated a claim about how there are fewer ""state government"" employees now than when former Gov. Christine Todd Whitman resigned in January 2001.

Better yet, the state accomplished that reduction ""without any layoffs,"" Christie said.

""New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that’s good,"" Christie said in a July 9 appearance at the Brookings Institution, a Washington, D.C.-based think tank. ""And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition.""

PolitiFact New Jersey issued a True ruling in December on Christie’s claim about how state government has fewer employees than when Whitman resigned.

But when we looked at recent data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, we found that the governor’s statement is no longer accurate. Christie’s claim about there being no layoffs is wrong too, because his representatives previously cited hundreds of layoffs during his tenure.

First, let’s explain what’s changed since our True ruling.

At the time of that ruling, the latest numbers were preliminary estimates for November 2011, showing 137,800 ""state government"" workers. That figure represented 600 fewer employees than the 138,400 state workers in January 2001.

But the November figures have since been revised to show 144,300 workers in that month, exceeding the estimate from January 2001. Every month since November also has shown a greater number of employees than when Whitman resigned.

When Christie repeated the claim last week, the latest figures were preliminary estimates for May 2012, when there were 146,100 state government employees. That represents a 7,700 increase, or nearly 5.6 percent, over Whitman’s final month.

Those statistics are seasonally adjusted and include workers in state departments; the legislative and judicial branches; state colleges and universities; state hospitals and state authorities and commissions, such as NJ Transit.

Brian Murray, a spokesman with the state Department of Labor and Workforce Development, acknowledged how ""the Bureau of Labor Statistics has since revised the data and shifted the estimated count of state employees higher.""

But Murray also pointed to a reduction in employees since the Whitman era in the subcategory of ""other state government,"" which includes the executive, legislative and judicial branches as well as state boards and authorities.

""It could be argued that the Governor has more day-to-day control over the workforces in the items included in ‘other state government’ rather than Educational Services and hospitals,"" Murray said in an e-mail.

However, in both claims, Christie has just referred to ""state government"" in general.

Also, when we referred to that overall category for our first fact-check, a Christie spokesman confirmed that was the source of the governor’s information. So, for this fact-check, we’re focusing on the same category.

It’s worth noting that since Christie took office in January 2010, the number of ""state government"" employees has dropped by 5,600, or nearly 3.7 percent.

But has the Christie administration reduced the state workforce ""without any layoffs""?

That’s not what the governor’s representatives told us in December when we were working on our first fact-check.

Between the start of Christie’s tenure and November 2011, ""743 out of 4,738 full-time positions eliminated were through layoffs,"" the spokesmen said in an e-mail, referring to the executive, legislative and judicial branches.

Those layoffs included 138 positions at the New Jersey Network, the state-owned TV network shut down at the end of June 2011.

Our ruling

At the Brookings Institution, Christie claimed: ""New Jersey today has fewer employees in state government than it had when Christie Whitman left office in January of 2001, and I think that’s good. And we did it without any layoffs. We did it through attrition.""

But the latest labor statistics show there were 7,700 more ""state government"" workers in May than when Whitman resigned. Also, the governor’s representatives have cited hundreds of layoffs during Christie’s tenure.

We rate the statement False.

"['Health Care', 'Virginia', 'Eric Cantor']","
Cantor says that under the health care law, the people who like their insurance will lose ""what they have""
","
The day after President Barack Obama’s health care law was upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-7th, was asked if he would concede defeat.

""The president’s team won and you guys lost,"" said Peter King of Bloomberg News in a TV interview with the congressman. ""Why not move on as the president suggests.""

Cantor vowed to continue his effort to repeal the law, complaining that it expands Washington’s control of health care and will be costly to the public. ""Frankly, the people who have health care in this country and like it will not be able to keep what they have,"" Cantor said.

Debate over how health care reform will affect medical insurance is huge in this year’s national elections. PolitiFact recently rated Half True an Obama claim that Americans who already have policies ""will keep"" their insurance."" It rated False a statement by Republican Mitt Romney that up to 20 million covered Americans ""will lose insurance that they like and want to keep.""

Is Cantor right that if you like it your health insurance, you will lose it?  We checked.

We asked Cantor’s office to back up the congressman’s claim. ""It’s a fact that the new insurance regulations in Obamacare will change the type of health insurance plans people currently have,"" spokeswoman Megan Whittemore replied in an email. ""Most employers are expected to modify coverage -- and some may even chose to drop employer-sponsored coverage altogether.""

Whittemore’s comments center on a quirk in the health care act, which in 2014 will require most people to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty.

The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that 213 million nonelderly Americans have health insurance this year and 154 million of them -- 72 percent -- are covered through employer policies.

According to Kaiser Family Foundation, the average insurance premium for a single employee last year was $5,429, with the company paying $4,508 and the worker contributing $921. The average cost for a family policy was $15,073, with the company picking up $10,944 and the worker paying $4,129.

The law requires all companies with 50 or more employees to provide health care insurance to workers and families or pay a $2,000 fine per worker tax, not counting the first 30 employees.

As a result, Whittemore said, many companies will find it ""far more economical"" to drop their health insurance plans and pay the penalty tax. Most workers, in such cases, would be left to find coverage on their own through private insurance exchanges that will be set up under the act.

Whittemore pointed us to two studies on the issue.

One is a report entitled ""Broken Promise: Why Obamacare Will Force Americans to Lose the Health Care Coverage They Have and Like."" It was prepared by the majority staff of the House Ways and Means Committee at the request of its chairman, Rep. Dave Camp, R-Mich., a critic of the health care law.

The majority staff sent questionnaires to all Fortune 100 companies. It concluded that the 71 companies that replied could save $28.6 billion in 2014 if they stopped offering health insurance and paid the tax.

Whittemore also said a 2011 study by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions ""found that up to 65 million people could lose their employer-sponsored health insurance because of Obamacare’s employer mandate requirement.""

Deloitte did find that, in a worse case scenario, 65 million workers could lose their employer-based insurance by the end of the decade because of the health care law. That could happen if more than 25 percent of large corporations with over than 5,000 employees and more than 50 percent of smaller businesses stopped offering insurance.

Keep in mind that 154 million Americans are insured by employers. Under this projection, 42 percent would lose their coverage. While that’s a big percentage, it does not even go half way to proving Cantor’s unbounded claim that, because of the health care act, the people who like their insurance ""won’t be able to keep what they have.""

Deloitte offered eight scenarios that are rosier than the one Cantor’s office cited. If, for example, 5 percent of large corporations 10 percent of smaller businesses cancelled their health coverage, then 7.7 million once-insured workers would need to seek coverage on their own.

And if Congress were to triple the $2,000 tax penalty on companies that don’t offer insurance, employer-based coverage would grow by 2.9 million people by the end of the decade.

Let’s look at a few other studies about the health care law’s impact on employer-provided insurance:

*The CBO estimated between 3 million and 5 million fewer non-elderly Americans will be covered by employers by the end of the decade.

*The Urban Institute projected a decline of about 500,000 people with employer coverage.

*The Lewin Group predicted a decline of 3 million people with work-based coverage.

*The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services actuary estimated 1 million fewer people will be covered by employers.

*The Rand Corp. projected about 4 million more people will be insured by employers in 2016.

There’s an important factor to keep in mind with these projections: Not all of the people falling out of employer coverage will be losing policies they like.

The CBO estimates that 3 million people will spurn their employers’ offer of coverage and turn to another source, such as the insurance exchanges created under the health care act. In many cases, they will do so because they consider the employer’s offering to be unaffordable or lacking in features they need.

Vast numbers of workers will see their work-sponsored insurance change for reasons that are not connected to the health care act. It’s common for employers and their insurance companies to unilaterally change their plans.

Mercer, a private consulting firm, found that in each year from 2005 to 2008, roughly a quarter of companies said they made changes to their plans that resulted in employees paying a greater share of the cost. In 2009 and 2010, it rose to one-third.

Our ruling

Cantor said that because of the health care law, ""The people who have health care and like it in this country are not going to be able to keep what they have."" His statement suggests that losing the health insurance you like is guaranteed by the law.

Cantor’s office backs the claim by noting the law makes it cheaper for companies to drop health coverage for their employees and pay a penalty tax. His office cites the bleakest of nine scenarios in Deloitte studies, under which 42 percent of workers would lose their company insurance.

The Cantor camp doesn’t mention that most of the other scenarios estimate a loss under 10 percent. We found five other studies that conclude the law will cause less than a 3 percent net loss of workers with company insurance. That group includes people expected to voluntarily give up their work policies because they prefer private plans that will become available under the health care act.

Even before the coverage mandate has taken effect, the number of companies that switch their plans each year has been substantial. The health care law is expected to increase that rate modestly, not exponentially as Cantor says.

"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'Bill Johnson']","
Bill Johnson says Ohio leads in job creation and has among the best jobless rates
","
Jobs are a major concern in Ohio's 6th Congressional District, which stretches along the state's southeast border from Youngstown to the southernmost counties in Appalachia. 
That means job creation is again a leading campaign issue in the rematch between Rep. Bill Johnson, the incumbent elected in the Republican sweep of 2010, and Charlie Wilson, the Democrat he unseated.

Johnson raises the issue when he meets with voters, and he mentioned it in June in one of the telephone town halls he uses to keep in touch with his sprawling district.

""I don't know if you realize this or not,"" he told a caller, ""but the state of Ohio has one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation right now and is leading the pack in terms of job creation.""

PolitiFact Ohio was interested because its positive tone seemed to contrast with a comment the congressman said, days later: ""We have to put America back to work.""

We asked his office for supporting sources. In a written statement, Johnson said, ""Because I talk to so many people in eastern and southeastern Ohio, I know that we need to make much more progress in job creation."" He blamed current economic conditions on what he called ""the job-killing policies"" of the Obama administration.

""I often give dozens of speeches and talks a week, rarely relying on a script,"" he said. ""While my precise wording certainly could have been better, the essence of my point is the same one The Plain Dealer's PolitiFact made just a few months ago.""

He cited PolitiFact Ohio's fact check of April 5, on Gov. John Kasich's statement that Ohio was ""the No. 1 job creator in America in February, and we are now the No. 4 job creator in the last year.""

We rated that statement as True.

But statistics are volatile. Kasich’s statement relied on job figures from several months before Johnson’s claim in his teleconference, so we checked the numbers again to see if it still holds up.

In discussing job creation, Kasich pointed to employment data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, and to the news release issued by the BLS when it posted new numbers on March 30.

In February, the BLS said, the nation's largest over-the-month increase in employment and ""largest statistically significant"" job gain occurred in Ohio, which was up 28,300 jobs.

That was then.

In March, Ohio went from first to worst by losing 5,200 jobs, the country’s ""largest over-the-month decrease in employment,"" according to the BLS. Another 2,000 jobs were lost in April.

Figures for May, which the BLS reported 10 days after Johnson spoke, showed that Ohio posted a gain of 19,600 jobs -- an increase second only to California's for the month.

A BLS economist told us that ""lots of things can happen other than the economy"" to affect job losses and gains over short period. They don't consider a one-month change significant, but prefer to look at longer trends -- such as Ohio's ranking 4th in job creation over a year.

We also looked at the state-by-state unemployment figures from BLS to see if Ohio does have ""one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation.""

The most recent BLS figures, for May, were released on June 15. They put Ohio's unemployment rate at 7.3 percent -- tied for 24th place with Arkansas and Missouri.

The figures for April, which were the latest available when Johnson spoke, had Ohio and Pennsylvania tied for 28th place with unemployment rates of 7.4 percent.

The latest unemployment rate was lowest in North Dakota, at 3 percent, and highest in Nevada, 11.6 percent.

At 24th or 28th, Ohio ranks in the middle, not among the lowest.

Ohio's rate has been on a downward trend and is below the national jobless rate of 8.2 percent. It also is lower than the rates in neighboring Michigan and Indiana, and lower than those of such large industrialized states as New York and Illinois.

What does it add up to?

Johnson conceded that his ""precise wording certainly could have been better,"" and we agree.

His statement contains an element of truth. While Ohio is not ""leading the pack"" in job creation, it does rank among the top dogs in the longer-term measurement that Labor Department economists see as statistically significant.

But the statement ignores some critical facts.

Johnson cited job creation numbers from February, a month in which Ohio was tops in the nation. But monthly stats for March and April, both available at the time of his statement, showed Ohio losing jobs.

And while Ohio’s jobless rate has improved considerably since it rose above 10 percent in 2009 and 2010, it is not one of the lowest unemployment rates in the nation. It now is below the national average. But now and at the time of Johnson’s claim, the state was in the middle of the pack.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Johnson’s claim rates Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jul/16/bill-johnson/bill-johnson-says-ohio/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'State Budget', 'Brian Robinson']","
Deal spokesman slips up on health care impact to Georgia
","
The recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling on the federal health care law had many Georgians attempting to figure out what it meant for the state.

Brian Robinson, the communications director for Gov. Nathan Deal, a Republican, offered some insight in a front-page article in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution that had a few readers and organizations questioning its accuracy. A couple of them contacted PolitiFact Georgia to get some answers.

State officials have said the law will result in at least 620,000 additional Georgians being eligible for its Medicaid program, which they estimate will cost about $4.5 billion over 10 years. Georgia was one of about two dozen states to join the lawsuit against the health care law that was reviewed by the Supreme Court.

""To pay for the expansion without tax increases would require the state to cut nearly a quarter of its annual budget,"" Robinson said. ""And that’s after we’ve shaved off billions in state spending since the beginning of the Great Recession.""

Cutting a quarter of the state budget? That could be catastrophic.

The Georgia Budget & Policy Institute, which has concluded the health care law will save Georgia money, quickly disputed Robinson’s math in a news release. The institute, which frequently takes moderate to liberal positions on many Georgia fiscal issues, also pressed the state to provide information detailing how it calculated the $4.5 billion estimate on state finances.

""It makes the issue sound bigger than it is,"" Tim Sweeney, the institute’s director of health policy, said of Robinson’s claim in a telephone interview. ""We want to make sure it’s out there that it’s not true.""

The Georgia General Assembly adopted a $19.3 billion budget for the fiscal year that began July 1.

The health care law expands Medicaid eligibility in 2014 to nearly all Americans under 65 with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. An additional 5 percent is disregarded when determining income eligibility, which effectively raises the threshold to 138 percent of the federal poverty level. The 2012 federal poverty level for a family of four in Georgia is $23,050. The number of Georgia enrollees is projected to rise from 1.6 million to nearly 2.3 million as a result of the the law.

The law provides that the federal government will pay 100 percent of the costs of covering these individuals through 2016. In the following years, the federal payment level gradually decreases, to a minimum of 90 percent.

The impact on state government in Fiscal Year 2015 is expected to be about $225 million, according to the state Department of Community Health. The annual impact of the health care law on Georgia’s Medicaid program rises by about $100 million a year between fiscal years 2016 and 2022, the state estimates. Georgia’s fiscal year begins July 1 and ends June 30.

As we noted, the state budget is $19.3 billion. If the state had to cut a quarter of its current budget, that figure would be about $4.825 billion.

But the health care law’s impact on Medicaid spending in Georgia is projected to stretch over 10 years, not one year. The Fiscal Year 2014 impact on Medicaid spending is estimated to be about $80 million, which would be about 2 percent of the state budget if the budget remains at its current levels.

Robinson, after an initial refusal to discuss the matter, admitted he erred.

""What I said isn’t accurate,"" he told us. ""I messed up. I was correctly quoted by the reporter.""

Robinson said his underlying point was that the health care law would result in potentially a major financial commitment from the state for Medicaid payments.

""The way I said it made it sound like we’re spending $4.5 billion more per year. That’s not true,"" Robinson wrote us via email. ""I SHOULD have said ‘Over 10 years, the new mandated spending will total a quarter of what the state spends on ALL services in its annual budget.""

Indeed. If he had said the potential impact of the health care law on Medicaid is equivalent to a quarter of the state’s budget, Robinson would have earned a True rating.

"['Candidate Biography', 'Health Care', 'Government Regulation', 'Public Health', 'Wisconsin', 'Tommy Thompson']","
GOP Wisconsin Senate candidate Tommy Thompson says he never backed individual mandate
","
Among conservatives, a hated provision of federal health care reform is the ""individual mandate,"" which requires Americans (with some exceptions) to buy health insurance.

That sentiment has left Republican Tommy Thompson in a difficult spot as he vies with three opponents in the August 2012 primary for U.S. Senate.

The former governor and U.S. health and human services secretary has made statements for and against the health care reform legislation that eventually became law. That led us to rate Half True a claim by the national Club for Growth, a conservative group, that Thompson supported ""Obamacare.""

On June 13, 2012, two weeks before the U.S. Supreme Court declared most of the reform law constitutional, Thompson issued two Internet statements about the individual mandate.  

In one message from a Twitter account for his campaign, Thompson said he ""didn’t support the individual mandate.""

And in the other tweet, directed at Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Matt Canter, he went further, stating:

""Can’t back down from something (i.e. the individual mandate) that you never supported, Canter.""

Taken together, Thompson is claiming he ""never supported"" the individual mandate.
Never is pretty absolute, so let’s check the record.

Opponents’ evidence

Arguing that Thompson did support the mandate, Canter cited a video clip released by the Washington, D.C.-based Club for Growth the day before the Supreme Court ruling.

(While the national Club for Growth has repeatedly attacked Thompson, and is supporting Republican Mark Neumann in the Senate race, the Wisconsin chapter has not.)

In the clip, Thompson speaks at a national health care reform forum at American University in Washington, D.C. At the April 2006 event, held more than two years before Obama’s election, Thompson refers to reform in Massachusetts, saying:

""You’ve also got to consider strongly -- and I happen to support that, what Massachusetts did -- and that is requiring health insurance, the coverage of health insurance. This is a little bit opposed to what Republicans really think or propose. But the truth of the matter is, just like automobile insurance, you’ve got to have coverage. And if you’re going to be able to cover the uninsured, you’re going to have to have some degree of a mandate to cover the uninsured.""

Both Canter and Club for Growth also cited video of a University of Texas speech in February 2007 in which Thompson says:

""I, for one, believe the mandate for health insurance is all right. We mandate insurance for automobiles. You know you can’t drive in Texas without automobile insurance. You can’t drive in any state without automobile insurance. It’s a mandate, but it’s certainly something that we should discuss in this country, and I think that’s positive.""

So, Thompson said he supported Massachusetts’ health insurance requirement and said such a mandate is ""all right,"" although both statements were made before Obama’s reform efforts were launched.

Thompson’s evidence

To defend Thompson’s claim, his campaign spokesman, Brian Nemoir, said Thompson ""is the only candidate who has testified before Congress against the mandates."" He cited a portion of Thompson’s May 2008 testimony to the Senate Finance Committee:

""I am not convinced that the individual mandate is the correct approach,"" Thompson said, according to a transcript. ""We have seen in Massachusetts that the individual mandate approach is not effective at covering the most vulnerable part of the population, that part of the population which needs coverage the most.""

So, after the generally supportive statements in 2006 and 2007, Thompson in 2008, shortly before Obama’s election, indicated he did not support an individual mandate.

Nemoir also cited an August 2011 report by the University of Pennsylvania-based FactCheck.org, which concluded that Club for Growth had falsely attacked Thompson as a ""champion of Obamacare,"" and he provided statements saying Thompson opposes what eventually became law.

But Thompson’s past or current positions on the overall reform are not at issue here.

In our item about Club for Growth’s claim about Thompson, Thompson’s campaign noted that Thompson at a July 2008 forum on a ""universal mandate"" for health insurance said: ""I don’t want a mandate."" But moments later Thompson said: ""I’m not opposed to it, I just don’t think it’s the most practical way.""

Our rating

Thompson said he ""never supported"" an individual mandate.

But while he is now an opponent of the health care reform law and its mandate requiring most Americans to buy health insurance, Thompson said in 2006 he supported a mandate and in 2007 said a mandate is ""all right.""

Joe Kyrillos claims the United States is not producing jobs
","
Joe Kyrillos rejects the term ""Bush tax cuts.""

Rather, the Republican U.S. Senate hopeful casts the looming expiration of lower federal tax rates -- enacted under former President George W. Bush -- as tax increases the country can’t afford. That’s his argument considering the jobs market, which Kyrillos erroneously claimed in a recent interview is not growing.

""If we don’t take action there will be tax increases and I guess we would call them [President Barack] Obama tax increases or [U.S. Sen.] Bob Menendez tax increases,"" Kyrillos, a state senator who is challenging Menendez this November, said in a July 11 interview on WNYC’s The Brian Lehrer Show. ""Here's the thing: our economy is not performing. We are not producing jobs. We created 80,000 jobs last month. We don't talk about the jobs that we lost. The net of it all is that we lost jobs. And so listen, raising taxes now in these times is not going to help with job creation.""

Actually, the nation is adding jobs and has been for more than 20 months. So what is Kyrillos -- who has been traversing New Jersey on a ""statewide jobs tour"" -- talking about?

""Our country has 4.894 million fewer jobs than we did at the start of the recession. That is the net job loss the Senator was referring to,"" Chapin Fay, Kyrillos’ campaign manager, said in a written statement.

Federal labor statistics confirm the country shed nearly 4.9 million jobs since December 2007, the official start of the recession, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research.

But since June 2009 -- the official end of the recession -- the nation added nearly 2.6 million jobs.

So to support his claim that the ""net of it all is that we lost jobs,"" Kyrillos includes all of the job losses incurred during the recession.

Fay said the point Kyrillos was ""making is that we still have lost a lot of jobs since the recession and are not replenishing them fast enough. That is the context of his sentence and that is factually correct.""

But Kyrillos didn’t make any reference to that time frame in the interview, as he explained why the economy can’t now afford a tax increase.

And the fact is the trend has reversed since the end of the recession.

Though it may not be the growth Kyrillos or the rest of the country would like, the nation added 80,000 jobs in June, according to preliminary estimates.

Fay said in his statement that ""the 12.7 million Americans currently unemployed are certainly not reassured by the measly 80,000 jobs netted last month.""

But there still has been job growth.

The nation has added more jobs than it lost every month since October 2010. In the private-sector, job growth has been sustained even longer, with gains every month since March 2010.

Year over year, the country added more than 1.7 million jobs overall from June 2011 to June 2012. Over the same time frame, more than 1.9 million private-sector jobs were added.

Our ruling

Kyrillos said ""we are not producing jobs. We created 80,000 jobs last month. We don't talk about the jobs that we lost. The net of it all is that we lost jobs.""

The country is producing jobs. To suggest otherwise is wrong.

Kyrillos’ campaign manager said the Republican candidate was referring to total job losses dating back to December 2007, the start of the recession, when he said ""the net of it all is that we lost jobs.""

But Kyrillos doesn’t make that distinction during the interview.

The nation has sustained monthly job growth since October 2010. And year over year, more than 1.7 million jobs were added.

Talk show host Buddy Cianci says Obama's health care plan dictates a 3.8 percent tax on home sales
","
It's the bogus claim that refuses to die.

Initially, the idea that President Obama's health-care law requires everyone who sells his or her home to pay a 3.8-percent sales tax was the stuff of unsigned chain e-mails.

On Wednesday, it was embraced by former Providence mayor and current talk show host Vincent ""Buddy"" Cianci.

Cianci was grilling Democratic congressional candidate Anthony Gemma about the health-care law; Gemma was barely able to get a word in edgewise. But it was Cianci’s questioning that caught our attention.

Cianci: ""Are you in favor of the part of Obamacare that says when you sell your house now you have to pay a 3.8-percent tax? When you sell the house. Are you for that?""

Gemma: ""No.""

Cianci: ""Well then, what are you supporting the Obama health-care plan for? Because that's what it calls for.""

Gemma: ""At the end of the day, at the end of the day . . .""

Cianci (interrupting): ""So if you sell your house, you've got to pay 3.8 percent. And you're for that? You're for that? I just want you to go on record. You're for paying the 3.8 percent when you sell the house? I just want to put you on tape. So you're for that? So the next time I ask you, you change your mind, that you can't say . . .""

Gemma (interrupting): ""I'm not for new taxes. I'm not for new taxes. I'm for appropriate . . . ""

Cianci (interrupting):  ""Well no. Are you for that? One question. Don't argue with me. I'm trying to get you some publicity. I want the people to know how you stand. Are you for the 3.8-percent tax on the house that a person sells when Obama's health plan goes in? Are you in favor of that? Are you in favor of that?""

Gemma: ""I am, I am for it, for it . . .""

Cianci (interrupting): ""Yes or no. Are you for it or against it?""

Gemma: ""I am for it -- the affordable . . . .""

Cianci (interrupting): ""Ok, thanks. I have to go to a break. He's for the tax.""

That's four times Cianci makes reference to a 3.8-percent tax if you sell your house. We e-mailed Cianci to see if he had any new information about the tax. We didn't hear back from him.

PolitiFact and other fact-checking organizations have looked at this issue before. (We last published an item on this in February.) They've all come to the same conclusion.

The health-care plan does include new taxes. One of them is a 3.8-percent tax on home sales by the wealthy and won’t affect the vast majority of sellers or buyers.

Here's why.

The tax does not apply to individuals with an adjusted gross income of under $200,000 in the year the sale takes place. Nor does it apply to couples with an AGI below $250,000. The amount a person (or a couple) makes on the sale is not included in the income calculation.

That rule alone eliminates the tax on more than 97 percent of tax returns.

Even if the seller exceeds the income limit, the tax only applies to the profit from the home sale, not the sales price itself. That's why it's not a sales tax, as it's sometimes characterized.

Finally, the first $250,000 in profit is excluded from the new tax. For couples, the first $500,000 in profit is excluded.

To put that in perspective, the National Association of Realtors reported in June that the typical home was selling for $182,600 in May 2012. That's sale price, not profit.

So if a couple bought a $100,000 home years ago and they sell it in 2013 for tens of millions of dollars, the new tax will cost them nothing if their combined adjusted gross income is under a quarter of a million dollars.

And if their annual income is in the tens of millions of dollars but their profit on the sale is a half million dollars or less, they will also escape the tax.

Cianci repeatedly made it sound as though every seller would have to pay the tax.

The new tax does not replace the long-standing capital gains tax on money made from the sale of property. That is still in effect.

Our ruling

We gave this claim a Pants on Fire when it was a chain e-mail making the rounds earlier this year. It got a Pants on Fire when it first surfaced, in 2010. It has been debunked by other fact-checking organizations as well.

Yet Cianci repeated this wild misrepresentation of one aspect of the new health-care law no fewer than four times in 45 seconds.

Perhaps he and Gemma, a successful businessman, make enough money to qualify for the tax if they sold their homes at a hefty profit. But for the vast majority of Rhode Islanders, suggesting that this tax applies to them is nonsense.

There may be no stains on Cianci's jacket, but there's a blaze in his britches.

We rate his claim Pants on Fire!

"['New Hampshire', 'Jobs', 'Ovide Lamontagne']","
Granite State has lost jobs during the recession like the rest of the U.S., just not that many
","
In his quest for a new job in the corner office, Republican gubernatorial candidate Ovide Lamontagne is trying to keep a close eye on New Hampshire’s employment picture.

""There are 60,000 fewer jobs today in this state than we had in 2008,"" Lamontagne, a Manchester Republican and veteran attorney, told audience members during a July 12 debate at Franklin Pierce University in Rindge, N.H.

""It’s going to take us until 2014, at this current rate, to re-employ who we had before,"" he said.

Looking at the statement, we’ll leave the 2014 projection alone. As for the 60,000 jobs lost, that sounds like a job for PolitiFact. Because of his wording, we are strictly going to examine whether the number is accurate without assessing whether state officials deserve blame or credit.

To start, we reached out to the Lamontagne campaign, which directed us to the New Hampshire Center for Public Policy Studies, a non-partisan research group that released a report earlier this spring looking at the Granite State economy.

The study, titled ""Skills and People Matching: Where are the Jobs?"" reports that New Hampshire is ""missing"" about 60,000 jobs. That means the current number of jobs in the state -- 626,500, according to New Hampshire employment figures -- is about 60,000 less than the jobs the state would have hosted if the recession had never settled in, according to Dennis Delay, an economist with the public policy center who presented the report earlier this month.

By the time the recession hit, New Hampshire had seen five consecutive years of job growth, rising from 614,900 in May 2003 to a high of 659,000 in May 2008, according to state employment figures. And, if not for the recession, the state would likely have continued to see job growth over the years to follow, reaching nearly 690,000 by now, Delay said.

""All other things being equal, the economy could have gone on creating jobs,"" he said. ""We had had a 10-year expansion prior to that point.""

But, then the recession intervened.

Starting in spring 2008, several months after the official start of the recession, New Hampshire began to shed jobs, falling from 651,000 in May of that year to 626,500 in May 2012, the most recent figures available.

Those numbers show a difference of 24,500 between May 2008 and May 2012 -- less than half of the 60,000 Lamontagne claimed.

To take it a step further, the highest job total in 2008 came in February of that year with 651,600 jobs, according to the state count. That difference is 25,100 -- still less than half of Lamontagne’s figure.

Those numbers, released by the New Hampshire Employment Security office, reflect the total number of full- and part-time jobs in the state, including those held by part-time workers and out-of-state residents, according to Annette Nielsen, an economist with the employment security office’s Economic and Labor Market Information Bureau.

The recent numbers, seasonally adjusted, are based entirely on surveys of employers, while the older figures have been cross-checked with data collected from tax returns, Nielsen said.

Neither tally includes self-employed jobs which do not contribute unemployment taxes. The employment office does not track those figures, but they shouldn’t weigh heavily on the total jobs numbers, Nielsen said.

""These numbers aren’t complete, but (the 60,000) number seems a little high to me,"" Nielsen said. ""We were closer to 30,000, and we’ve added some since then. ... That’s still a huge drop for New Hampshire.""


Our ruling:

To Lamontagne’s point, New Hampshire, like the rest of the country, has lost many jobs since the recession started. But the candidate got his numbers wrong. The report he cites compares the current jobs count to the number the state could have reached if the recession had never hit, which isn’t the same thing. Lamontagne’s number of 60,000 jobs lost was twice as high as the actual number of jobs lost.

"['New Hampshire', 'Economy', 'Charles Bass']","
Is it getting more difficult to start a business in the U.S. and is it Obama's fault?
","
Veteran congressman Rep. Charles Bass, R-NH, labeled 2012 as ""gut-check time"" in America when he filed to run for another two-year congressional term last month.

After signing his papers at the New Hampshire Secretary of State’s Office on June 11, Bass stumped on national jobs and economic issues.

His call for a gut check spurred a PolitiFact New Hampshire fact check.

""The economy is going nowhere,"" Bass said, touting jobless rates and unemployment statistics, median income levels and the national debt.

""America used to be the third-easiest country to get established in a business,"" Bass went on. ""It’s now number 17, and I could go on.""

Ranking a country on the ""ease"" of establishing a business seemed curious, so we contacted his ""Victory Committee"" to find out which sources Bass used to support his claim.

Victory Committee spokesman Scott Tranchemontagne pointed us to Doing Business reports from 2006 and 2012, which are conducted by the World Bank and International Finance Corporation, specifically the ""Starting a Business"" category listings produced with each.

And, they owned up for an error.

Bass, ""incorrectly stated that we are ranked 17th and instead it should have been 13th"" for 2012, Tranchemontagne wrote, though Bass did get the 2006 ranking right. ""While the congressman inadvertently stated the wrong number, it is clear that 13th is an entirely unacceptable ranking - and indicates that our economy has been going in the wrong direction.""

The 2012 study considers a number of factors when weighing the ease of starting a business, including regulations on ""starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency (formerly closing a business) and employing workers.""

Bass was clear about who he thinks is to blame.

""Congressman Bass has clearly indicated that he believes that the administration's economic plan is not working and it is time to try something else,"" Tranchemontagne wrote.

But is ""the administration"" really to blame for the country’s drop on the global ""starting a business"" list?

It is not accurate to compare rankings across several years, according to Nadine Ghannam, head of communications for The World Bank & International Finance Corporation’s Global Indicators and Analysis Department.

""Doing Business only publishes rankings for the current year, and the year immediately preceding the publication,"" Ghannam said. ""Rankings are relative and only represent an economy's position vis-a-vis the rest of the economies sampled.  An economy's ranking may drop even if the situation did not get worse, simply by the fact that other countries have improved.""

Essentially, a ranking is only accurate at the time of publication and does not account for data changes that have occurred, Ghannam said, such as countries being added over the years, methodology changes, and minor corrections that were made to the data.

What’s more, by examining the data sources, or the indicators and sub-indicators, Ghannam said, one will find that the ""Starting a Business"" process in the U.S. has not actually changed over the years, except for some fees that have increased ""non-significantly.""

Ghannam used the 2004 report to show that it took six procedures, six days, and a cost of about 0.7 percent of gross national income (GNI) per capita to start a business in the U.S. In 2012, the report shows it still takes six procedures and six days to start a business, with the cost slightly increased to 1.4 percent GNI.

""It is important to note that this indicator records the procedures, time, cost and paid-in minimum capital requirement to start a domestic LLC in New York City,"" Ghannam added, ""and therefore all of the costs associated with the increase are a result of fees charged in the State of New York, and not linked to any federal fees.""

Our ruling:

Bass said America took a 14-spot hit from 2006 to 2012 in its ease-of-starting-a-business rank when compared with other countries--and blamed it on the administration.

He was four off from the actual Doing Business ranking for the United States--it was ranked 13 in 2012, not 17-- and took credit for his error. And if he had been comparing apples to apples, that might have been a reasonable conclusion.
But it turns out, he was off on the logic.

The team behind the report says Doing Business rankings should be examined independently of each other. Countries go up or down on the Starting a Business leaderboard if other countries’ have improved, if data has changed, if other countries are added to the list, and other factors--not necessarily because the United States’ own situation has gotten worse. And the process to start a business in the U.S. has hardly changed at all.

For getting the ranking wrong and misinterpreting the data, we give Bass a Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jul/13/charles-bass/it-getting-more-difficult-start-business-us-and-it/

Were Romney's companies 'pioneers in outsourcing' ?
","
For Mitt Romney, a candidate who has made job creation the centerpiece of his campaign, it hardly helps to have news reports that Bain Capital invested in companies that moved jobs overseas.

Based on that coverage, the Obama campaign produced a television ad that asserted ""Mitt Romney's companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries.""

Our fellow fact-checkers at FactCheck.org and the Washington Post said similar claims from the Obama campaign were exaggerated. That prompted the Obama campaign to take the unusual step of pushing back with a long letter defending the claims. Subsequently, other news organizations have reported more on Romney’s time at Bain, which in turn led the Obama campaign to accuse Romney of not telling the truth about himself and the firm he once led.

We decided to fact-check two parts of the Obama campaign’s statement. Were these really Romney’s companies? And were these companies actually ""pioneers in outsourcing"" ? 
Romney and his campaign have noted repeatedly that Romney left management of the company in 1999. That may be, but Romney was the company's founder, providing vision and direction for Bain. It's not as if his influence ended the moment he left to run the Olympics. 
Meanwhile, calling the companies ""pioneers in outsourcing"" overstates the case. They did promote outsourcing, but they were part of a trend already decades in the making. 
Romney's companies?

Romney started Bain Capital in 1984. Its specialty was investing in new companies and helping them grow or taking troubled companies and turning them around. Romney likes to mention success stories like Staples, the office supply company.

Some of these firms were deeply involved in outsourcing. The word ""pioneers"" comes directly from a June Washington Post article: ""During the nearly 15 years that Romney was actively involved in running Bain, a private equity firm that he founded, it owned companies that were pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories making computer components.""

The Romney camp demanded a retraction on the grounds that some of the companies cited also created jobs in the United States. Others companies became part of the Bain portfolio after Romney took a leave of absence in February 1999, to run the 2002 Olympics in Salt Lake City. The Washington Post retracted nothing.

As an example, let’s start by looking at a company that Bain did control under Romney’s watch: Modus Media.

Modus Media specialized in helping companies like IBM and Dell Computers manufacture hardware overseas. As FactCheck.org confirmed, it was controlled by Bain. No one argues whether Modus Media created jobs in countries such as Singapore and China.

Now, if those jobs never existed in the United States in the first place, it is difficult to argue that Modus Media or Bain sent them overseas. But in 2000, the firm unambiguously disrupted the lives of about 200 American workers when it announced it was closing a plant in Fremont, Calif. and opening one in Guadalajara, Mexico.

The Romney campaign argues that prior to this, Modus Media had created about 700 domestic jobs. We don’t know the quality and pay of those jobs and how they would compare to the jobs that were lost. But we do agree that those new jobs should be part of the overall picture.

The Romney campaign has also repeatedly asserted that the plant relocation didn’t happen during ""Romney’s time."" FactCheck.org emphasized that the move took place ""more than a year after Romney had left Bain.""

This issue of when Romney stepped down and whether he can be held accountable for things that happened after February 1999 has become something of a cottage industry in the media. Talking Points Memo, Mother Jones, and the Boston Globe have unearthed SEC filings and personal financial disclosure statements that list Romney variously as CEO, Managing Director, and president of Bain as late as 2002. Bain released internal memos that seemed to show Romney played no role in management decisions.

The Washington Post’s Fact Checker added another document that lends weight to the argument that Romney was not part of Bain management after 1999. It is a 2002 Massachusetts State Ballot Law Commission report certifying Romney’s eligibility to run for governor. It examined Romney’s activities when he took over the Olympics and based on weeks of testimony, the report revealed a man consumed with that task and who had no active connection to Bain.  

Looking at all the evidence made public so far, we do not think Romney was actively involved in the day-to-day management of Bain after 1999. But it doesn’t mean his influence disappeared after he left. 
Were they ""pioneers""?

Romney was the company’s founder, and we think it worth a broader look at Bain’s investment practices, starting in the early 1990s.

""Typically, private equity companies tended to focus on companies in the $100 million to $500 million range,"" said Anant Sundaram, a researcher in mergers and acquisitions at the Dartmouth Tuck School of Business. More often than not, they turned them into companies worth $2.5 billion.

Getting there was not easy. ""Did the private equity firms have the incentive to do a lot of cost cutting?"" Sundaram said. ""You bet. Was outsourcing one of the ways of cutting those costs? You bet. Everybody was doing it.""

Our research shows that outsourcing was well established by the time Bain began buying shares in the companies described in the recent articles. To call these companies pioneers is a stretch.

""This had been going on for decades,"" said Tim Sturgeon a researcher who focuses on outsourcing at the Industrial Performance Center at MIT.

Outsourcing grew significantly starting in the early 1990s thanks in part to the expansion of the Internet and changes in the rules of international trade. Bain was one of scores of private equity firms that participated.

""They were part of the herd,"" said Sturgeon. ""To say they picked the pioneers gives (Bain) too much credit for being innovative. It was a mainstream strategy by that point.""

Every expert we contacted agreed that when Bain invested in the companies in question, it was counting on high returns that included the results of outsourcing.

In that light, the exact month that Romney stepped away from Bain makes little difference. When Modus Media closed that plant in California in 2000, it was making the kind of move Romney and Bain expected when they first got behind it. The particular decision was not known, but the general nature of the decision was, the experts we spoke with said.

Matthew Rice, Chief Investment Officer for DiMeo Schneider and Associates, a Chicago-based investment consulting firm, says he doesn’t see how Romney can divorce himself from the strategies that made Bain profitable.

""Technically, I guess he can,"" Rice said. ""But they would have done it anyway, whether he was there or not. If you can offshore and cut costs, you do it. Because if you don’t, the business might not survive and nobody would have any jobs.""

And Bain would not make any profits. And the sole purpose of any fund, private equity or otherwise, is to make a profit.

Our ruling

The Obama television ad holds Romney responsible for sending jobs outside the country. It said ""Romney’s companies were pioneers in outsourcing U.S. jobs to low-wage countries.""

We find reasonable grounds for labeling the companies as ""Romney’s."" He was the founder of Bain and assembled a team that looked to make high returns. One strategy was to invest in companies that played off the trend in outsourcing. We make no judgment on whether outsourcing is good or bad. It was widely seen as profitable, and Bain selected companies that would succeed.

If picking a company makes it yours, then these were Romney’s companies and in a general sense, they did what he expected them to do. The one caveat is there is a gray area of direct accountability, because no one has reported that he was personally involved in managing those firms.

We find little evidence that the particular firms were ""pioneers in outsourcing."" The Obama campaign took the word from the Washington Post but used it as its own. Outsourcing was well established by the early 1990s, and firms were applying it in a variety of industrial areas. The Bain companies were among that group. 
The Obama campaign's statement would have voters believe that Romney played a key role in driving the outsourcing phenomenon. We find that an exaggeration.

Roys says Pocan voted with Walker in favor of tax cuts for wealthy corporations
","
State Reps. Kelda Helen Roys and Mark Pocan united against Gov. Scott Walker’s collective bargaining limits in 2011, but competition for a big promotion is creating friction between the two Madison Democrats.

The two are seeking the Madison-area 2nd Congressional District seat, which is open because U.S. Rep. Tammy Baldwin is running for the U.S. Senate. The all-important primary in the heavily Democratic district is Aug. 14, 2012.

In the race, Roys is tagging Pocan as ""caving"" by voting with Walker on two pro-business bills.

In pointed remarks at a July 9, 2012 news conference, Roys riffed about Walker’s ""outrageous"" series of ""corporate tax giveaways for wealthy corporations -- some of them out of state."" She said the Republican governor’s intent was to help his ""deep pocketed friends.""

Then she went after Pocan.

""Were we going to vote for Walker’s corporate tax giveaways or were we going to do the right thing for working families that need and rely on the public services we provide?"" Roys asked. ""On those votes, when it really mattered, Mark Pocan failed the judgment test by voting for Walker’s corporate tax giveaways.""

In a district that strongly opposed Walker in the failed June 2012 recall election, those are fighting words.

Did Pocan help Walker deliver tax breaks for ""wealthy corporations""?

Roys singled Pocan out for votes on two bills in the January 2011 special session. She repeated the charge in a new TV ad, though without narrowing it to two bills, and without naming Pocan.

--Assembly Bill 3, which wiped away two years of taxes for businesses that relocate to Wisconsin. Estimated price tag in lost tax revenue for the state treasury over two years: $1 million over two years.

--Assembly Bill 4, which expanded the Economic Development Tax Credit program by $25 million, bringing it to $98.1 million. The credit can go to businesses that locate or retain corporate headquarters in Wisconsin, create jobs, make capital investments or train workers, the Journal Sentinel reported.

Pocan did vote with the Republicans on both bills. But both bills attracted major support from Democrats in the Assembly, passing with 82-12 majorities. In other words, Pocan joined about two-thirds of the Democratic caucus in the Assembly in voting ""yes.""

Roys was opposed, decrying aid to out-of-state firms while existing businesses paid full freight, and calling the Economic Development Tax Credit expansion unnecessary. She said she thinks Pocan ""caved"" because ""people want to give Walker the benefit of the doubt and don’t want to be tagged as anti jobs.""

Pocan, a small business owner, defends the bills as modest efforts of the kind that Roys herself has supported in the past -- as she did in 2009 under Democratic Gov. Jim Doyle, when Pocan was co-chair of the Legislature’s budget-writing committee.

Pocan also noted the bills had minimal impact on the state’s 2011-’13 deficit. At the time of the vote, fiscal analysts predicted that none of the $25 million in additional tax credits would be claimed during the two years, because the fund was flush, as we noted in an earlier item. The other bill had a $1 million price tag over the two years.

What about the other bills in the special session? Roys specified two, but also referred to a ""series.""

Roys did not mention the biggest tax-break bill in that session: Assembly Bill 7, a much modified version of Walker’s push to give small businesses a tax break. In the end, the bill gave both mom-and-pop businesses and large corporations an estimated collective income tax break of $33.5 million a year -- tied to how many jobs they create. It passed 60-33 in the Assembly, with only three Democrats joining the GOP majority.

Pocan did buck Walker on that one, as did Roys.

 Finally, Roys said the two were aimed at helping ""wealthy corporations."" But neither tax credit program is limited to larger businesses.

Our rating

Roys said Pocan caved by supporting Walker’s tax breaks ""for wealthy corporations"" while she stood in opposition.

Pocan did vote for two bills that potentially could help large corporations cut their tax bills, so she is partially on target. But she leaves out important details that change the picture.

Pocan opposed a much bigger-ticket tax break bill in the same session, and the two he backed helped small businesses as well as large corporations. What’s more, two-thirds of Democrats in the Assembly backed the bills -- and Roys herself is a past supporter of one of the programs.

Josh Mandel campaign says Sherrod Brown's approval ratings have plummeted
","
Sen. Sherrod Brown has a challenge on his hands this November.  How serious depends upon how one reads the polls and regards the money being spent against him by third-party groups.

Brown is an incumbent Democrat. His Republican challenger, Ohio Treasurer Josh Mandel, says things are definitely looking bad for Brown and cites a survey from a Democratic pollster as proof.

Mandel, in a fund-raising pitch sent by email on July 9, used the number 38 to make his case. The number represents ""the number of years Sherrod Brown has been a career politician,"" Mandel said. But ""38 is also Sherrod Brown’s approval rating in a recent poll conducted by a Democratic polling firm.

""Yes, you read that correctly,"" Mandel continued. ""His approval rating has plummeted to 38 percent among Ohio voters, and down to 33 percent among Independent voters!""

That decline caught PolitiFact Ohio’s attention. Has Brown’s standing among voters dropped precipitously?

Mandel’s campaign communications director, Travis Considine, pointed us to the poll his boss had mentioned. Published on June 27, the poll was conducted by Public Policy Polling, a Raleigh, N.C., firm that represents Democratic candidates but that also conducts polling for general consumption. We turned to that poll, and to other surveys from PPP, as it is known.

A news release accompanying the latest PPP poll actually had a headline quite different from Mandel’s point. The headline said, ""Sen. Brown holds steady, Kasich already in trouble.""

The first paragraph in the news release announcing the results said, ""Despite steady increases in name recognition for Republican challenger Josh Mandel, incumbent Sen. Sherrod Brown continues to hold onto a modest lead in his first re-election bid.""

In this automated telephone poll, conducted June 21 to June 24, Brown led Mandel by 7 percentage points. This meant  that Brown’s lead had dropped by only 1 point in a month despite ads from the Mandel campaign and groups that support him. Furthermore, PPP reported, ""Independents support Brown over Mandel 43-34.

There’s more, most of it supporting Brown. ""Sherrod Brown continues to lead the contest by a healthy margin,"" the PPP release concluded.

Wait a minute. Didn’t Mandel’s fund-raising email suggest otherwise?

Read the language closely. Mandel did not pick a number reflecting how voters would have decided if the vote had been in late June. Those are the so-called horse race numbers we mentioned above that are important for getting a sense of where the race stands at any given time.

But in the PPP poll, 15 percent of Ohio voters were still undecided.This is why other poll questions mattered.

For instance, what do voters think of the job Brown is doing in the Senate? Those job-approval ratings can be important because they suggest potential weakness or strength as the campaign season continues. Mandel’s would not be the first campaign to look for an opponent’s weakness, spotlight it and then try to close the sale by offering voters an alternative.

Thus, the PPP poll question Mandel cited: ""Do you approve or disapprove of Senator Sherrod Brown’s job performance?""

The answer, from a sample of 673 Ohioans who voted in at least one of the last three general elections (2006, 2008 and 2010):
  
Given the poll’s 3.8 percentage-point margin of error, that difference between approval and disapproval is small -- perhaps inconsequential. But Mandel focused on other points, too. 

He looked at changes in Brown’s approval ratings since January. To better understand, we ran out the numbers from a series of PPP polls. Consider:

Brown had a 42 percent job approval rating in a PPP poll conducted Jan. 28 and 29. His disapproval rating was 34. By early May, his approval had dropped by 2 points, still inside the margin of error, while his disapproval rating rose by a mere single digit.  No noteworthy changes, in other words.

Then came the latest PPP poll. It coincided with an advertising push by Mandel as well as that of outside business and conservative groups that have spent more than $10 million in hopes of ousting Brown.

The latest PPP poll put Brown’s approval rating at 38 percent. His disapproval had grown to 42 percent,

Put those together -- the 4-point drop in approval and the 8-point rise in disapproval since January -- and it means that Brown’s approval ratings ""have suffered a net loss of 12 points,"" Considine told us.

Is it fair to put those numbers together to get to a 12-point loss?

PPP director Tom Jensen told us yes. ""That’s how we would usually do it,"" he said.

It’s important to note that this is only one poll. We looked at the trend for Brown’s job approval this year in polls by Quinnipiac University, and unlike PPP, Quinnipiac showed a barely perceptible change of a single digit in each direction.

But Mandel was specific. He clearly referred to ""a recent poll conducted by a Democratic polling firm."" So there was a drop. And it’s fair to consider it a 12-point drop on net, says the pollster.

That brings us to a final point of consideration: Has Brown’s approval rating ""plummeted,"" as Mandel said?

""I wouldn’t describe it as a plummet,"" Jensen said. ""Both Brown’s and Mandel’s numbers have gotten worse"" as the two go after one another.

Karlyn Bowman, an impartial polling expert at the Washington think tank American Enterprise Institute, suggested the use of ""plummet"" is best left to wordsmiths. ""If I was looking at these numbers for Obama, I wouldn’t use the word ‘plummet,’ but it certainly is a significant change,"" Bowman said.

Our Webster’s dictionary describes ""plummet"" as a sharp and abrupt drop. Most of the changes in Brown’s approval ratings occurred over little more than a month. Polls are best read over the course of time, but Brown’s drop in this one is relatively quick.

So Mandel’s statement is accurate.

But it bears noting that while he correctly cited data that showed Brown’s approval rating had declined, the poll wasn’t full of good news for Mandel, either.

PPP found that only 24 percent of Ohio voters held a favorable opinion of Mandel. That’s still better than the 14 percent he got in January. Most voters then didn’t have an opinion of him.

Conversely, 39 percent of Ohio voters held an unfavorable view of Mandel in late June -- 14 points worse than in January, PPP data show.

So both these candidates might have a problem.

And Mandel’s numbers left out the question that may matter most: For whom would you vote? He was selective in his data, ignoring the top line of the PPP finding that said Brown ""holds steady"" in his lead. The latest Quinnipiac poll gave Brown a whopping 16-point lead in the horse race.

In this context, you’d expect a politician to choose his best data, however selective. Mandel’s statement omits additional information that provides clarity. But the numbers he chose were accurate, despite the rhetoric.

That’s why we rate Mandel’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jul/13/josh-mandel/josh-mandel-campaign-says-sherrod-browns-approval-/

GOP lawmaker Jeff Duncan repeats survey finding that 83 percent of doctors are considering quitting due to Obamacare
","
As the House was taking another vote to repeal President Barack Obama’s health care law in mid July 2012, a number of Republicans offered a grim view of the health care system’s future under ""Obamacare"" by citing poll results that said many doctors were thinking about quitting.

One example: a July 10, 2012, tweet from Rep. Jeff Duncan, R-S.C., who wrote: ""83% of doctors have considered leaving the profession because of ‪#Obamacare‬ ‪#repealandreplace.""

Many readers urged us to fact-check this statistic, which was circulated widely in the blogosphere in addition to being mentioned by other Republican lawmakers, such as Rep. Cathy McMorris Rogers of Washington state in an MSNBC interview.

We found it came from a survey by the Doctor Patient Medical Association Foundation, a group founded last fall that is opposed to the health care law.

The group asked: ""How do current changes in the medical system affect your desire to practice medicine?"" According to the group, 83 percent answered, ""Makes me think about quitting,"" 5 percent said, ""I’m re-energized,"" while 13 percent said they were unsure or had no opinion.

So while the number is right, it's important to examine whether Duncan has accurately explained the results.

Are the poll’s respondents actually talking about ""Obamacare""?

Despite the linkage by Duncan and other lawmakers to Obama’s Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), as ""Obamacare"" is officially known, the question actually does not mention the law. In fact, only the final question in the poll mentions anything about it, in passing.

Instead, the question asks about ""current changes,"" which could include not just the law, but many other factors, such as changes driven by insurance companies and hospital systems. There’s no way of knowing what specifically the respondents were referring to.

In an interview, Kathryn Serkes, the founder and CEO of the Doctor Patient Medical Association, emphasized that the group was not asking specifically about the health care law. She noted that other findings in the survey painted a more nuanced picture than pure anti-Obamacare sentiment.

For instance, when asked to provide their top three choices for ""who’s most to blame for current problems in medicine,"" 65 percent of respondents did choose ""government involvement in general,"" but the next three categories were ""health plans/insurance,"" ""third-party payers"" and ""lawyers,"" with 50 percent, 42 percent and 42 percent, respectively. And while 27 percent cited ""president"" as one of their three choices, an almost equal number, 26 percent, cited ""Congress,"" which is most visible today for a House Republican leadership that is dead-set against Obama’s health care law.

""What we know from the other answers in this survey is that there are two main things going on for doctors -- government control and corporate control,"" Serkes said. ""The rest of the results in the survey show doctors bemoaning corporatization as a very close second to government control. Many doctors don’t separate the two.""

The poll’s sponsor

As with any poll, it’s always important to know who paid for it.

The group’s website says, ""It is DPMA's position that PPACA is the Destruction Of Our Medicine, attempting to insert the government and bureaucrats between the relationship and decisions of medical professional and their patient."" It was founded by a longtime representative of the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons, a group that stands for ""individual liberty, personal responsibility, limited government, and the ability to freely practice medicine according to time-honored Hippocratic principles.""

By itself, this doesn’t mean that the poll is untrustworthy. But it's important to consider that the group is strongly opposed to the law.

The poll’s methodology

Survey experts expressed some concerns about its design, noting that it's difficult to get accurate surveys on specific groups and occupations.

The DPMAF was transparent about its methodology. The survey was conducted by fax and online from April 18 to May 22, 2012. Of 16,227 faxes that were successfully delivered to doctors’ offices, 699, or 4.3 percent, submitted responses.

Experts said they were concerned with two aspects of the poll:

• Respondents weren’t given much of a middle ground. The choices for answering this question were ""makes me think about quitting,"" ""I’m re-energized"" and ""unsure/no opinion.""

""It’s a poorly worded question that does not offer a complete range of likely alternatives, such as 'no effect,'"" said Don Dillman, an expert in mail-based polls and a professor at Washington State University. Charles Franklin, a polling specialist at the University of Wisconsin, agreed that the response categories offered were ""odd.""

In addition, interpreting the question requires caution, because asking about whether someone has ""considered"" something as dramatic as quitting their lifelong profession is a long way from saying they will do so.

Serkes acknowledges this. ""Do I expect doctors to quit en masse? "" she said. ""No, I don’t. Doctors don’t do anything en masse in the U.S.""

• Because the response rate was only 4.3 percent, it’s hard to gauge how representative the survey was. A different recent survey of doctors with a similar response rate -- conducted by the Deloitte Center for Health Solutions -- took the extra step of weighting their sample ""by years in practice, in combination with gender, region, and specialty to reflect the national distribution of physicians in the (American Medical Association) master file."" DPMAF did not.

If a respondent knew about or could detect DPMAF’s conservative policy orientation from the questions, or if they learned about the group’s orientation during the weeks-long period they were given to turn in the survey, they might have been likelier to take part. If they disagreed with the group’s stance, they might have been less likely to take part.

Still, there’s no way to prove that DPMAF’s sample was biased. Either way, Serkes noted that her group never claimed scientific authority for the poll. ""We didn’t say specifically that this was a scientific poll, nor did we state confidence levels or margins of error,"" she said. ""We were very transparent about that.""

Other estimates

We looked for alternative estimates in similar surveys and found that the Deloitte poll asked doctors if they agreed that ""physicians currently practicing will stay in practice."" Fifty-four percent said yes, while 34 percent said physicians would stop practicing. That's far below the 83 percent who told the DPMAF that they were considering quitting.

Our ruling

Duncan said ""83% of doctors have considered leaving the profession because of #Obamacare."" But that's an inaccurate description of the foundation’s poll.

The poll did not specifically ask about the federal health care law and was meant to measure concerns about a wide range of changes in health care. Also, it's worth noting that the poll had a small return rate and the group that conducted it is opposed to the law.

Ad says Obama apologized, showed weakness on Iran
","
A new ad from an independent group claims President Barack Obama apologized and showed weakness on Iran.

The ad comes from Secure America Now, which calls itself a ""broad-based grassroots coalition of 2 million national security activists."" A reader in Florida asked us to check it out. It uses clips from an interview Obama gave in the White House during his first days in office with the Arab network Al Arabiya.

A female voiceover says, ""For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology."" (The words ""an apology"" flash across the screen.)

Then it cuts to Obama telling the interviewer, ""Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating.""

The voiceover says, ""He reached out.""

Obama: ""It is important for us to be willing to talk to Iran.""

Voiceover: ""Iran answered with terror, attacks on our troops and nuclear weapons development. …Tell President Obama: no apologies, no weakness. It’s time to stop Iran.""

The claim that Obama has apologized for America has been used and reused countless times -- always falsely -- and we found that this incarnation is only a hair closer to the truth.

His first interview

Obama sat down with Hisham Melhem, Al Arabiya’s Washington bureau chief, on Jan. 27, 2009. The network, based in Dubai, is regarded as a less-radical format than Al Jazeera and has been criticized for having a pro-Saudi Arabia bias.

News coverage at the time billed the interview as Obama’s ""first television interview in the White House,"" according to the New York Times, and ""his first formal television interview as president,"" per the Washington Post. A spokesman for Secure America Now also pointed us to an MSNBC story characterizing the interview as the new president’s first.

The Al Arabiya interview was part of a coordinated unveiling of Obama’s diplomatic initiatives. He had just named former Maine Sen. George Mitchell as special envoy to the Middle East, and before he sent Mitchell off on a tour of the region, he called Arab and Israeli leaders on his first full day in office.

So it’s fair to say this was Obama’s first interview as president.

No apology
  
The interview begins with Melhem asking Obama about Mitchell's appointment and how the administration plans to pursue peacemaking between Israelis and Palestinians. 
Obama responds: 
Well, I think the most important thing is for the United States to get engaged right away. And George Mitchell is somebody of enormous stature. He is one of the few people who have international experience brokering peace deals. 
And so what I told him is start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating -- in the past on some of these issues --and we don't always know all the factors that are involved. So let's listen. He's going to be speaking to all the major parties involved. And he will then report back to me. From there we will formulate a specific response.  
Ultimately, we cannot tell either the Israelis or the Palestinians what's best for them. They're going to have to make some decisions. But I do believe that the moment is ripe for both sides to realize that the path that they are on is one that is not going to result in prosperity and security for their people. And that instead, it's time to return to the negotiating table.  
And it's going to be difficult, it's going to take time. I don't want to prejudge many of these issues, and I want to make sure that expectations are not raised so that we think that this is going to be resolved in a few months. But if we start the steady progress on these issues, I'm absolutely confident that the United States -- working in tandem with the European Union, with Russia, with all the Arab states in the region -- I'm absolutely certain that we can make significant progress. 
The ad uses only his comments, ""Start by listening, because all too often the United States starts by dictating."" But Obama was discussing how to begin brokering a peace deal between Israelis and Palestinians. He was not referring to Iran, as the ad implies.

In addition, we don’t agree that those words equate to an apology. In that statement, and a few others, Obama seemed to be acknowledging that past efforts in the Middle East have been imperfect.

Later, speaking about the wider Arab world, Obama said, ""My job to the Muslim world is to communicate that the Americans are not your enemy. We sometimes make mistakes. We have not been perfect. But if you look at the track record, as you say, America was not born as a colonial power, and that the same respect and partnership that America had with the Muslim world as recently as 20 or 30 years ago, there's no reason why we can't restore that.""

Nowhere in the interview did Obama use the word ""apology,"" ""apologize"" or ""sorry.""

PolitiFact has examined the apology claim numerous times. Mitt Romney, the likely Republican presidential nominee, wrote in his book and repeated many times that Obama has apologized for America around the world.

But again, there isn’t an ""I’m sorry"" anywhere to be found in Obama’s speeches or remarks. One expert we’ve talked to before says Obama is using conciliatory language for diplomatic purposes, not apologizing.
   
""It's much more a sense of establishing of reciprocity,"" John Murphy, a communications professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, told PolitiFact in 2010. ""Each side says, okay, we haven't done great, but we have a new president and we're going to make a fresh start and move forward. I don't think that's an apology.""

Our ruling

Secure America Now’s ad says, ""For his first interview as president, Barack Obama chose Arab TV for an apology."" The ad particularly emphasizes that Obama apologized.

Obama’s first television interview after taking office was with the Al Arabiya network at the White House. But the ad gets nothing right beyond that.

By saying ""all too often the United States starts by dictating,"" Obama was not apologizing but being diplomatic about past strategies that failed to yield results. What’s more, the ad criticizes Obama’s approach to Iran, but his quote actually referred to the Israelis and the Palestinians.

The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts and gives an inaccurate impression. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jul/12/secure-america-now/ad-says-obama-apologized-showed-weakness-iran/
