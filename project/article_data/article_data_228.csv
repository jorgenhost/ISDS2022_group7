Deal claims Handel supported gay adoption
","Nathan Deal is portraying gubernatorial candidate Karen Handel as out of step with Georgia Republicans because she allegedly supported gay adoption seven years ago.In a statement published in the Rome Tribune, Deal lashed out at Handel for what he says were her positions in her race seven years ago for chairwoman of the Fulton County Commission. Deal’s campaign is quoted as saying: ""Actually, 2003 isn't so ‘old,’ and the truth is that Handel endorsed gay adoption when she campaigned for Fulton County Commission chair in 2003 while courting votes and fund-raising.""But did she?First, a little primer on Fulton County politics vs. Georgia politics. The gay community is a politically active and powerful force within Fulton County. Much of the community is centered in Midtown Atlanta. Making nice with that community can help you get elected in city and county politics, and both Democrats and Republicans court the gay vote.But in statewide politics the landscape tilts very conservative. What plays well in Midtown often bombs in Marietta and Moultrie. Endorsing gay adoption could demolish a Republican or Democratic bid for any statewide office in Georgia. Handel has steadfastly denied Deal’s allegation and is on the record as an opponent of gay adoption in more recent campaigns. In her successful run for secretary of state in 2006 and in her current gubernatorial bid, she has opposed allowing gay people to adopt children. Indeed, in 2006, she was criticized for that stance in an Atlanta Journal-Constitution editorial that otherwise backed her candidacy.""Although the secretary of state's office has zero influence on legislative policies, Handel’s Web site features her opinions on abortion, domestic partnerships and gay adoptions, all of which she opposes,"" said the Oct. 16, 2006, editorial.Deal’s allegation is that Handel backed gay adoption when she was running for office at the local level only to flip-flop when she got into the state arena. Deal has also accused Handel of once being a member of the Log Cabin Republicans, a GOP gay rights organization. Stay tuned. We will address that allegation in a future PolitiFact Georgia report.For this round, we concentrated solely on Deal’s assertion that Handel had once backed gay adoption. Deal’s campaign strategists base their allegation on a single statement by Marc Yeager, former president of the Georgia Log Cabin Republicans, in the now-defunct Southern Voice, a newspaper that catered to the gay community.In an Aug. 15, 2003, article, Yeager is quoted saying: ""We will be continuing our support for Karen Handel. She demonstrated in her last run that she was supportive of domestic partner benefits, and she's supported same-sex adoptions on the basis of the best interest of the child.""Enough said. Or so says the Deal camp. ""This was announced in a newspaper, and she didn’t ask for a correction because it was accurate,"" said Brian Robinson, Deal’s communication director. ""Karen Handel can’t have it both ways.""Handel’s camp said the gubernatorial hopeful never backed gay adoption.""Nathan Deal should put down the gay tabloid and try to find a real source for his false attacks,"" said Dan McLagan, a spokesman for the Handel campaign.We tried to contact Yeager numerous times, but he did not return our calls. Yeager’s comment was the only evidence we could find that Handel ever supported that position. Handel’s campaign and a half-dozen people familiar with her positions on gay rights issues in the 2003 race said she never supported gay adoption.State Rep. Jill Chambers (R-Atlanta) said she and Handel visited the Log Cabin booth at Atlanta’s 2002 Gay Pride Festival, as did other local and state politicians.""But neither one of us backed gay adoptions, certainly not publicly. It was not high on the agenda,"" Chambers said. ""We shook hands. We handed out some brochures.""Jamie Ensley, the current president of the state Log Cabin Republicans, said Handel spoke to their chapter ""many times"" during her run for the Fulton County Commission and later for chairwoman. ""But gay adoption was never an issue,"" Ensley said. There is no evidence, other than a passing statement by Yeager in an extinct newspaper, that Handel ever voiced support for gay adoptions. And in subsequent runs for office, she has repeatedly declared she opposes it. There is some smoke here -- a widely distributed publication stated that Handel supported gay adoption, and she never asked for a correction. But the bulk of evidence appears to back Handel’s denial. We rate Deal’s statement Barely True. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809BFF0880>],/factchecks/2010/jun/07/nathan-deal/deal-claims-handel-supported-gay-adoption/

Staples says EPA regulation of greenhouse gases endangers Texas farms, dairy plants and cattle operations
","Todd Staples, the state agriculture commissioner, this year joined Gov. Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott in objecting to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency designating half a dozen greenhouse gases as endangering public health. Staples says on his campaign website, which we visited in late May, that he’s fighting the December “endangerment” finding because the consequences would be disastrous for Texas farmers who, he implies, would suffer from government monitoring and regulation of gases emitted by animals and equipment. “Companies that will be endangered in Texas include 575 dairy facilities, 58 swine operations (and) 1,300 corn farms,"" Staples says. ""No industry is more threatened than the cattle industry. If this rule is implemented, an estimated 28,000 beef cattle operations in Texas will fall under EPA regulation.” Milk, pigs, corn, cows – the feds whuppin' all these grown-in-Texas products? We wondered if Staples plows a straight row. Cody McGregor, Staples’ campaign manager, said the commissioner, a Republican seeking re-election, derived his Texas figures from a July 2008 letter written by the U.S. Department of Agriculture in response to the EPA’s draft advance notice to regulate greenhouse gases. In its letter, the USDA said that if greenhouse gas emissions were regulated under the Clean Air Act, numerous farms then not required to seek gas-emission permits would be so burdened. The 1970 act directs the EPA to establish air quality standards; the law requires the agency to concentrate on major polluters, which are defined as those that emit more than 100 tons of unhealthful pollutants a year. The  USDA letter says that even “very small agricultural operations"" would fall in that category: ""For example, dairy facilities and farms with over 500 acres of corn may need to get a Title V permit. It is neither efficient nor practical to require permitting and reporting of (greenhouse gas) emissions from farms of this size. Excluding only the 200,000 largest commercial farms, our agricultural landscape is comprised of 1.9 million farms with an average value of production of $25,589 on 271 acres.” O June 23, 2009, Staples sent a letter to Lisa Jackson, the EPA administrator, objecting to the greenhouse gas endangerment finding. That letter says that based on the USDA’s herd and acreage estimates, Texas in 2007 had approximately 575 dairy facilities, 28,000 beef cattle operations, 58 swine operations and 1,300 corn farms that met the “regulatory threshold.” So, Staples aired his Texas estimate nearly a year ago based on the USDA’s assessment of the impact of EPA plans to regulate greenhouse gases drafted about a year before that. Presuming his math is solid, we wondered if the nearly 2-year-old concerns shared by USDA still hold. To our queries, Staples did not say precisely why or how the EPA's permitting will endanger the Texas operations he tallies. In Washington, EPA spokeswoman Catherine Milbourn looked over the information provided by Staples’ campaign. She said the analyses reflect expectations about the EPA’s plans that are no longer valid because the EPA effectively excused farms from complying with the requirements cited in the USDA’s letter. EPA spokesman Brendan Gilfillan followed up with an e-mail: “These types of doomsday scenarios are simply untrue. EPA issued a rule that would specifically ensure small businesses and farms are shielded from clean air act permitting for” greenhouse gases. The EPA’s May 13 final ""tailoring rule,"" a descriptive reflecting the agency's decision not to impose the same pollutant thresholds on greenhouse gases that were spelled out for pollutants in the Clean Air Act, specifies the types of entities that will initially have to toe the line on greenhouse gas emissions. An accompanying fact sheet states: “Facilities responsible for nearly 70 percent of the national (greenhouse gas) emissions from stationary sources will be subject to permitting requirements under this rule. This includes the nation’s largest (greenhouse gas) emitters—power plants, refineries, and cement production facilities. Emissions from small farms, restaurants, and all but the very largest commercial facilities will not be covered by these programs at this time.” At this time? The fact sheet says the EPA is committing to additional rule-making by July 2012 which may discuss “whether certain smaller sources can be permanently excluded from permitting.” Permits for smaller sources of any type won't be required until at least April 30, 2016, the agency says. In a May 13 blog post headlined ""EPA Greenhouse Gas Rules Likely Target for Suits,"" Legal Times magazine in Washington notes that the Clean Air Act requires entities that emit 100 to 250 tons of pollutants per year to get government permits to do so. Because greenhouse gases are emitted in much larger quantities than traditional pollutants, the 100 to 250 ton threshold would require permits for small farms, restaurants and apartment buildings, for example. In raising the threshold, the agency is admitting the absurdity of applying the lower limits to more prevalent greenhouse gases, the blog says. McGregor of Staples’ campaign conceded the EPA's May 13 rule excludes farms. McGregor said, however, that what the EPA says today ""can likely change tomorrow."" He pointed us to an online analysis of the rule by Washington lawyer Richard Stoll, whose clients include industrial operators including Portland cement manufacturers. Stoll told us he expects the rule to be challenged in federal court because the pollutant thresholds in the rule are far above what the Clean Air Act mandates. More broadly, Stoll said, the EPA wants Congress to pass laws related to greenhouse gas regulation; one way of touching off such action is to issue rules likely to be tossed in court. “There is a good chance that the DC circuit (court) will throw that regulation out and then all of a sudden EPA is going to be confronted with having to do something about all these farms and everything (else),” Stoll said. “There’s grounds to be fearful here.” However, Stoll said, should the EPA ever get to the point of requiring farmers to monitor and report on localized gas emissions, Congress almost certainly will intervene. ""If all of a sudden you’re having farmers worried about monitoring cow farts, Congress will be all over this,"" he said. ""It might not be immediately; it could be a damn mess for a while."" Shannon Goessling, executive director and chief legal counsel of the conservative-leaning Southeastern Legal Foundation, which has challenged the endangerment finding, contends the EPA had another reason for excusing farms and other small businesses from greenhouse gas regulation: The government hopes they will drop their resistance to the endangerment finding. There's another legal view. Melinda Taylor, former director of the Environmental Law Clinic at the University of Texas School of Law, agreed with Stoll that the EPA wants Congress to step in and take on greenhouse gas emissions. But, she said, it’s also likely the EPA would prevail in court if its May 13 rule is challenged. Generally, she said, “courts will not substitute their own judgment for that of an agency.” Besides, she said, “farmers have always been very successful in making the case they can’t comply with regulations that would be onerous and inordinately costly to them — to the detriment of the environment, I might add.” Phew. Where does all this leave Staples’ statement? The commish had a basis for his numbers in the 2008 USDA letter. But his assumption that farms would be subject to the regulations expired when the EPA issued its final rule weeks ago. Since, Staples has neither adjusted nor reasonably explained his outdated complaint. His statement is False.

Daily Kos founder admits slip-up on calling Turkey an Arab country
","During the June 6, 2010, edition of ABC's This Week, Markos Moulitsas, who publishes the liberal blog Daily Kos, joined a roundtable discussion that touched on Israel's decision earlier this month to send commandos to board a flotilla carrying aid and activists in defiance of an Israeli blockade of Gaza. The commandos clashed with some of those on board, and the raid ended with nine people dead.
 
Moulitsas said, ""I mean, the fact is whether Israel had the right to do what it did or not, they handled it so poorly that they basically alienated much of the world. They alienated an important Arab ally in Turkey, and they put the United States in a really difficult position.""
 
Shortly after the show ended, Moulitsas sent this Twitter message: ""I got one for PolitiFact -- I slipped and called Turkey an 'Arab' country. I knew it as I said it. I meant 'Muslim.'""
 
His Twitter correction was right: Turkey is not an Arab country.
 
""Arabs and Turks are distinct peoples, separated by language, ethnicity, and geography. Although Turkey is adjacent to the Middle East, it is not generally considered part of that region,"" said Amy Hawthorne, executive director of the Hollings Center for International Dialogue. The Hollings Center operates in both Washington, D.C., and Turkey, and Hawthorne is a trained specialist in Middle East and Arab affairs.
 
In Turkey, the predominant language is Turkish, while in Arab countries, the main language is Arabic. The Arab League has 22 members, and Turkey is not among them. And between 70 percent and 75 percent of Turkey's population is ethnically Turkish, with 18 percent Kurdish and the remainder smaller minorities (including a modest number of Arabs).
 
The one thing that Turkey has in common with the Arab world is religion: An estimated 99.8 percent of the Turkish population is Muslim.
 
""I knew I was wrong as I was saying it,"" Moulitsas told PolitiFact in an e-mail. ""But everything moves so fast that everything had moved on before I could say, 'Boy that was dumb -- I meant 'predominantly Muslim country.'""
 
Moulitsas has graciously copped to his error (and even invited us to ding him), but the Truth-O-Meter doesn't cut any slack for confessions. So we rate his statement False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097899C80>],/factchecks/2010/jun/06/markos-moulitsas/daily-kos-founder-admits-slip-calling-turkey-arab-/

""Chalkboard"": Job figures don't add up to the whole story
","A TV ad for the Roy Barnes gubernatorial campaign harks back to a rosier time in Georgia history -- the last recession.The ad, called ""Chalkboard,"" says that the number of jobs in this state rose from 1999 through 2003 while Barnes was governor, even though his term included a recession that ended nationally in November 2001. Georgia struggled to add jobs until 2003. The commercial puts it this way:""Roy Barnes will make Georgia work. Again. When he was governor, Georgia created 235,000 jobs. We can do it again. And more."" Georgia created jobs? Despite the recession? Barnes' statement implies that his actions led to the creation of these jobs, an assertion that is impossible to prove. Many factors encourage job creation, and many of those are outside any governor's purview. What we can do is establish whether he left Georgia's economy as healthy as he portrayed it to be. Here goes: The Barnes campaign credits the data to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which collaborates with state governments to publish monthly figures on the country's economic health. Those figures show that while employment ticked up and down during Barnes' tenure, when it was all said and done Georgia was left with more than 238,000 additional jobs. In December 1998, the number of people employed was 3,925,076. By December 2002, it was 4,163,184. Generally, economists think an increase in employment is good. Yet a closer look shows that despite the growth, jobs grew tougher to get under the Barnes administration. Those same BLS figures show Georgia's unemployment rate rose a full percentage point from 3.9 percent to 4.9 percent. The number of unemployed Georgians grew by more than 52,000. We interviewed two experts who said job growth and unemployment can take place at the same time because during a recession job-seekers often give up and the labor force shrinks.As the economy picks up, the number of available jobs grows. So does the labor force. People who gave up looking for work decide to give it another shot. But until there are enough jobs to absorb the expanding labor force, unemployment grows, too. So during the end of Barnes' watch, things weren't great for job-seekers. But overall, economic data show the state's economy did grow. Georgia's overall gross domestic product grew from about $224 billion to $267 billion. Georgia's annual personal income -- the income received by all the residents of the state -- increased during Barnes' time as well. Barnes' statement was correct but gave the impression that employment conditions were stronger than they were. We therefore rate Barnes' claim as Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979E4DC0>],/factchecks/2010/jun/05/roy-barnes/chalkboard-job-figures-dont-add/

SAT scores: Oxendine's comparison not so smart
","In a video on his campaign Web site, gubernatorial candidate John Oxendine makes the case that Georgia's education system has serious problems. His evidence: Our students are doing worse than those in ... Alabama. This is what he said: ""As a parent of four children, three of them in school, I’m very concerned about our education system. We have SAT scores lower than that of Alabama, yet a dropout rate that’s higher. We need to make some serious changes in how we address education.” Georgia? Even worse than Alabama? Ouch. But is it true? For this item, we'll examine whether he is correct about Alabama beating Georgia in SAT scores. A later item will deal with his claim on dropout rates. Oxendine's campaign pointed us to the National Center for Education Statistics, which collects and publishes data for the U.S. Department of Education. Sure enough, Alabama's mean SAT scores for 2009 are higher than Georgia's in all categories: critical reading, mathematics and writing. And the gap is large. Alabama's writing score is 549, 70 points above Georgia's. Its mathematics score beats Georgia's by 61; critical reading by 67.But when we took a closer look at the numbers, we found that Oxendine's interpretation of Georgia's SAT scores is not as clear-cut as it seems. Only a small percentage of Alabama's students take the SAT compared with a much larger percentage in Georgia. For that reason and others, the College Board, the group that administers the SAT, strongly cautions against doing state comparisons. ""Not all students in a high school, school district or state take the SAT. Since the population of test-takers is self-selected, using aggregate SAT scores to compare or evaluate schools, districts, states or other educational units is not valid, and the College Board strongly discourages such uses,” the College Board said in a statement to PolitiFact Georgia. This warning and others like it are repeated on the College Board's Web pages, in its statewide reports, plus in its guidelines for interpreting scores.When fewer students take the test, as in Alabama, the numbers get skewed because the test-takers are more likely to be the top students who are applying to the most selective schools. The introduction to each one of the College Board's state profile reports puts it this way: ""The most significant factor to consider in interpreting SAT scores for any group, or subgroup, of test-takers is the proportion of students taking the test. For example, if state data are being considered, it is appropriate to recognize that in some states there are lower participation rates. Typically, test-takers in these states have strong academic backgrounds and apply to the nation's most selective colleges and scholarship programs. For these states, it is expected that the SAT mean scores reported for students will be higher than the national average."" In Georgia during the 2008-2009 school year, 71 percent took the SAT. In Alabama, it was 7 percent. And indeed, Alabama's scores walloped Georgia's. To get a different view of how the states compared, we decided to look at scores for the ACT, the college entrance exam that is more widely used in Alabama. According to 2009 figures, 76 percent of Alabama high school graduates took the ACTs, with an average composite score of 20.3. In Georgia, 40 percent took the test and scored an average of 20.6. So on the ACT, Georgia beat Alabama. And we got the same kids-don't-try-this-at-home warning from the ACT we got from the College Board: It's not smart to compare the scores of two states. We took these facts to the Oxendine campaign, which said our examination misses its overall point that Georgia needs to make education a higher priority. Plus, the campaign argued, people such as business owners who look at Georgia's SAT scores will see them and worry that this state doesn't have a labor pool that is strong enough for its needs.Whether Georgia needs to make education a higher priority is a matter of opinion. But we think people who hear his claim will wonder whether Georgia indeed has lower SAT scores than its neighbor. He's technically correct, but his claim ignores some important caveats. With so few students in Alabama taking the test, the results can be skewed and paint a misleading picture. Indeed, the ACT shows Georgia ahead of Alabama. So we find his claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9A540>],/factchecks/2010/jun/05/john-oxendine/sat-scores/

Linder says Graves played minor role in FairTax
","U.S. Rep. John Linder (R-Ga.) and 9th Congressional District candidate Tom Graves seemed to be on the same page regarding their support for the FairTax, particularly since they spoke in favor of the idea at an event in Missouri in June 2009.Not exactly.Graves has been telling supporters and voters about his efforts to work with Linder on the FairTax.""I’ve traveled the country advocating for the FairTax, along with Herman Cain, Neal Boortz and John Linder,"" Graves, a former state representative, said at an April 23 candidate debate at the Georgia Mountains Center in Gainesville.Linder, who represents Georgia's 7th Congressional District and is retiring at the end of this term, says that's an exaggeration. The congressman took the unusual step of accusing Graves, a fellow Republican, of lying about his efforts to push the idea. Linder even said he ""didn't know who [Graves] was or why he was there.""""Tom Graves is telling you that he has traveled the nation with John Linder to sell the FairTax. That simply is not true,"" Linder said in a 30-second robocall on May 27 for Graves’ opponent, Lee Hawkins.The congressman added: ""If a candidate is willing to lie to you to get elected, what will you expect from him after he is elected?""The Graves campaign said it is surprised by Linder’s remarks and baffled by Linder's seeming unfamiliarity with the candidate.""It’s kind of bizarre for the congressman to say he didn’t know what he [Graves] was doing there,"" said Graves campaign spokesman Tim Baker, who added the two men traveled together to the event.We decided to check out how involved Graves has been with Linder to sell the FairTax.First, what is the FairTax? It would abolish all federal personal and corporate income taxes and other taxes, and replace them with a federal retail sales tax, according to the Web site FairTax.org. It essentially is a consumption tax -- the more you buy, the more tax you pay.The FairTax is an important cause to Linder. He’s been advocating the idea for more than a decade and co-wrote a book with Boortz explaining its benefits. Jennifer Drogus, Linder's communications director, said her boss appreciates Graves' support for the FairTax. But Linder felt like Graves exaggerated his role in the effort.We asked Graves campaign officials whether they thought their candidate was exaggerating things a bit by saying he ""traveled the country"" in support of the idea.""The record speaks for itself,"" said Baker, the campaign manager. ""If you look at the fact, he was there.""When asked whether they made other trips to talk about the FairTax, the Graves campaign focused on that Missouri trip as proof that their candidate is correct. Yes, they made a trip halfway across the country. But we think one trip to Missouri does not equate to ""traveled the country.""We find Tom Graves’ claim is Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979E4F80>],/factchecks/2010/jun/05/tom-graves/linder-says-graves-played-minor-role-fairtax/

DeKalb water bills inexpensive in comparison to region
","DeKalb County water officials made the case to their Board of Commissioners at a May 19 meeting that they need to raise water and sewer rates to pay for the system's aging infrastructure. The argument was the time-honored claim used by elected officials, plumbers and mechanics: We're cheaper than the other guys.""Over the next several years, everybody else will be adjusting rates,"" said Francis Kung'u, director of the DeKalb County Watershed Management Department. ""But for now, we are still below average in the metro region.""We were curious about his claim that DeKalb's rates are ""below average"" and decided to check it out.DeKalb officials gave the commissioners a thick packet of information that included how much money 15 nearby counties and the city of Atlanta charge per month for water and sewer use. DeKalb based its comparison on 6,000 gallons a month. That's the average amount of water homeowners use each month, officials in several areas said. The monthly bill for DeKalb customers who use 6,000 gallons a month is $51.34, county officials said.DeKalb's chart shows the county with about the lowest water and sewer rates among metro counties and Atlanta. So was DeKalb right?We first focused on six of the largest water systems in the metro area: Cherokee, Clayton, Cobb, Fulton and Gwinnett counties and the city of Atlanta. DeKalb is the state's third-highest-populated county. Its Watershed Management Department has a $227 million annual budget, which ranks among the highest in the state.Atlanta's rates were the highest, more than twice the monthly cost of those in DeKalb County. The city approved two sets of rate increases in the past decade to help fund its ongoing $4 billion effort to overhaul its sewer system and improve water quality. The average monthly cost is nearly $121. (Brace yourselves, Atlanta homeowners, the monthly rate is scheduled to rise by an additional 12 percent on July 1.) City officials say Atlanta's rates may be the highest in the nation.The other water systems were more in line with DeKalb. They ranged from Cobb's $53.88 a month to Gwinnett's $69.44 monthly charge for the average customer.We also checked with 10 water and sewer systems in smaller cities and counties that DeKalb used to base its report. Most of them range between $65 to $70 a month. The average monthly charge in Walton County is $44.85, but it doesn't charge for sewer service.Again, the reason DeKalb wants to increase the rates is because its system is getting old. DeKalb's population grew faster than many of its neighbors, thus its infrastructure has more wear and tear. The county has a $1.79 billion repair list. Could that be why DeKalb's rates are lower?Perhaps, said Sally Bethea, executive director of the Upper Chattahoochee Riverkeeper, a group that has monitored Atlanta's efforts to fix its sewer system.""They may have not yet made the kinds of investments Atlanta has made,"" she said.If you focus solely on the larger counties or all 16 governments that DeKalb studied, the numbers do show DeKalb's rates for the average customer are below the metro average.

Fiorina attacks Boxer for caring more about ""the weather"" than terrorism
","The latest ad from California Senate candidate Carly Fiorina -- who is running in the Republican primary to take on incumbent Democratic Sen. Barbara Boxer -- mocks Boxer for saying in 2007 that ""one of the very important national security issues frankly is climate change.""
 
After playing a clip of Boxer's statement, Fiorina faces the camera and responds, ""Terrorism kills, and Barbara Boxer's worried about the weather.""
 
No one doubts that Boxer made the comment. But we wanted to check the context of Boxer's remark and see if Fiorina was quoting it accurately. We examined three elements:
 
• How well-accepted is the idea of climate change as a national security threat?

Sufficiently well-established to have been been promoted by both the Pentagon and CIA.
 
A Quadrennial Defense Review Report issued by the Department of Defense in February 2010 states that ""assessments conducted by the intelligence community indicate that climate change could have significant geopolitical impacts around the world, contributing to poverty, environmental degradation, and the further weakening of fragile governments. Climate change will contribute to food and water scarcity, will increase the spread of disease, and may spur or exacerbate mass migration."" It concludes that ""while climate change alone does not cause conflict, it may act as an accelerant of instability or conflict, placing a burden to respond on civilian institutions and militaries around the world.""
 
Meanwhile, on Sept. 25, 2009, the CIA announced the launch of a Center on Climate Change and National Security. According to a CIA press release announcing the launch, the center's charter ""is not the science of climate change,"" but rather ""the national security impact of phenomena such as desertification, rising sea levels, population shifts, and heightened competition for natural resources.""

So while there is certainly room for disagreement about how big a national security threat climate change will ultimately be, Boxer is hardly advocating a fringe theory. The notion that climate change will be significant is being discussed at the Pentagon and the CIA.

• Is it fair to say that Boxer's concern about climate change amounts to being ""worried about the weather""?

This comment conflates two concepts that people often confuse, but are actually quite different.

""Weather"" refers to daily variations in sun, precipitation, wind, heat and cold. ""Climate,"" by contrast, refers to typical atmospheric patterns over a much longer time scale. The Merriam-Webster online dictionary defines ""climate"" as ""the average course or condition of the weather at a place usually over a period of years as exhibited by temperature, wind velocity, and precipitation."" A more lighthearted explanation is ""climate is what you expect; weather is what you get.""

We asked 10 experts -- a mix of governmental and academic climate scientists, broadcast meteorologists and climate policy specialists at think tanks -- whether there is a broad consensus among their peers that weather and climate are different concepts. They all agreed that there is.

""There is no debate between scientists and meteorologists, as the terms 'weather' and 'climate' are not interchangeable,"" said Drew Jackson, a former meteorologist with KPTV-TV in Portland, Ore. ""Scientists, meteorologists and climatologists fully understand that.""

The closest that one of our experts came to detecting some justification in Fiorina's conflation of the two fields came in comments by Samuel Thernstrom, a fellow at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. He noted that climate change does cause changes in weather, meaning that Fiorina's statement is ""not necessarily inaccurate."" But even he added that her phrasing in the ad ""is pejorative and arguably misleading,"" and we agree.

• By focusing on the threat of climate change, did Boxer somehow ignore the issue of terrorism?

We should begin by noting that Boxer chairs the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, which gives her a key perch for discussing environmental issues. She's also on the Foreign Relations Committee, but does not sit on either Homeland Security or Armed Services, two panels that more directly address terrorism.

In addition, it's not clear to us that having concern over climate change and terrorism are mutually exclusive. Still, we think it's valid to review Boxer's record on terrorism.
 
Critics point to her 2007 vote against a supplemental funding bill for the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan as evidence she is soft on terrorism. Boxer said she voted against it for tactical reasons -- she and some of her fellow Democrats were seeking to tie further war funding to a more explicit troop withdrawal date. The critics also cite her votes against $86 billion for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan in 2003, as well as her vote against the use of military force in Iraq in 2002.

At the same time, opponents accuse Boxer of being soft on the treatment of terrorism suspects. In 2006, for example, Boxer voted to preserve habeas corpus rights for Guantanamo detainees. She also voted in 2006 against extending the wiretapping provision of the PATRIOT Act.

On the other hand, Boxer's campaign offers a number of initiatives she's made on terrorism, including:
 
• Leading a bipartisan coalition in 2002 to pass an amendment allowing commercial airline pilots to carry guns in cockpits and providing flight crews self-defense training. She also wrote a law to put more air marshals on high-risk flights, such as the nonstop cross-country flights that were hijacked on Sept. 11.

• Voting for President Barack Obama's economic stimulus package, which included more than $300 million to strengthen port security, public transportation security and railroad security. It also included $680 million to strengthen border security and $1 billion for airport security.
 
• Cosponsoring of the Iran Refined Petroleum Sanctions Act, to give the president expanded authority to impose new economic penalties on foreign firms involved in the export of gasoline and other refined petroleum products to Iran.
 
• Voting in 2009 for a war supplemental spending bill proposed by Obama to fund a troop surge in Afghanistan. ""I am voting for this bill not because I want the U.S. to remain bogged down in two wars but because I want to give this administration, the Obama Administration, the resources it needs to successfully end the wars starting with the war in Iraq,"" Boxer said in a floor speech. ""Furthermore, I do not support an open-ended commitment of American troops to Afghanistan, and if we do not see measurable progress, we must reconsider our engagement and our strategy there.""
 
• Voting in 2007 to implement the 9/11 Commission report.

• Supporting a bill to establish a global strategy to defeat al-Qaida in 2008. So to recap, Fiorina is guilty of a major distortion here. Boxer brought up climate change and said it was ""one of the very important national security issues,"" but Fiorina ignores that wording and portrays it as if Boxer cited it as the only priority. In addition, Fiorina casts climate change as something you need to pack an umbrella for, or that prompts you to curse at the TV weatherman -- which strikes us as not only a trivialization of climate change but also a failure to distinguish between two well-established scientific specialties. She also ignores Boxer's lengthy record supporting bills against terrorism. So we have to light up the meter: Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809726B680>],/factchecks/2010/jun/04/carly-fiorina/fiorina-attacks-boxer-caring-more-about-weather-te/

Pelosi touts Democratic record on job creation
","Politicians love to tout the monthly employment numbers -- and frame them in the best light. That's what House Speaker Nancy Pelosi did on June 4, 2010, when the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced its monthly job figures for May.In a news release, the Speaker's office said in part, ""Last month, the unemployment rate fell and private sector jobs expanded; we have added jobs in six of the last seven months. This year, we have added an average of 200,000 jobs per month, a majority in the private sector, a stark contrast to the Bush Administration record of losing an average of nearly 750,000 jobs per month in its last three months.""We found Pelosi largely correct on the details but that she dodged some important context.-- Last month, the unemployment rate fell. Correct: It fell from 9.9 percent to 9.7 percent, where it had been for the first three months of 2010.-- Last month, private sector jobs expanded. Correct: The economy added 41,000 new jobs in May, although that represented the smallest increase since January 2010.-- The U.S. has added jobs in six of the last seven months. Correct: The economy added 64,000 jobs in November 2009, lost 109,000 jobs in December 2009, added 14,000 in January 2010, added 39,000 in February, added 208,000 in March, added 290,000 in April, and added 431,000 in May.-- This year, the U.S. has added an average of 200,000 jobs per month. Very close. The average was 196,400. Pelosi would have been on safer ground if she'd said the economy ""had added, on average, almost 200,000 jobs per month.""-- A majority of the jobs added this year have been in the private sector. Correct, though barely. The average monthly increase in private sector jobs was 99,000, or 50.4 percent of new jobs added.But here's the part we paid special attention to, because it seeks to contrast these numbers with the record of President George W. Bush:-- These statistics stand in ""stark contrast to the Bush Administration record of losing an average of nearly 750,000 jobs per month in its last three months."" The numbers are correct as Pelosi phrased them, but she is cherry-picking. Her selection of time periods for the comparison produces a picture that's as flattering as possible to the Democrats. We think a listener hearing this would assume that President Barack Obama's job creation record stood in ""stark contrast"" to Bush's, when in fact the time periods Pelosi uses put Obama's record in the best possible light -- because it skips all of 2009 -- and puts Bush's in the worst possible light.She conveniently left out all of 2009, when the nation lost 4.7 million jobs, or 395,000 per month. That's a monthly rate nearly twice as large as the increases recorded in 2010. Looked at another way, the job gains in 2010 that Pelosi touts have only replaced one-fifth of all the jobs that were lost in calendar 2009. Meanwhile, the final three months of the Bush presidency accounted for the worst job loss totals of his presidency.Yes, the job-creation record for 2010 represents a significant improvement over 2009, and it's true that assigning ""blame"" for the job losses in 2009 is tricky, since many of the job losses under Obama were set in motion under policies implemented by Bush. Still, we feel that comparing the three worst job-loss months of Bush's presidency to the five best job-gain months of Obama's is an example of highly selective math.A spokesman for Pelosi, Nadeam Elshami, told PolitiFact that when the Speaker's office sends out job-related news releases, it attaches a graph that has the full picture of gains and losses starting in December 2007 -- the start of the current recession. That chart shows jobs declining by larger and larger amounts until a low point in January 2009, when Obama took office, then climbing (that is, losing fewer jobs every month) until November 2009, when the monthly changes, with one exception, turned into net job gains. The chart also appears on the Speaker's blog.While we didn't find a copy of the chart included with the news release when we found it on Pelosi's website, Elshami forwarded us a copy that had been sent to reporters earlier that morning that did include it. So we'll give her office partial credit for providing some context, even if it didn't come in the document we initially found.In all, then, the Speaker's portrayal of the numbers is technically accurate, but the general impression she gives -- that the record under a Democratic president and a Democratic Congress stands in ""stark contrast"" to the record under Bush -- is political spin based on selective choices about what data to use. We rate Pelosi's statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096E32580>],/factchecks/2010/jun/04/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-touts-democratic-record-job-creation/

Rick Scott, former healthcare CEO, defends Columbia/HCA's record
","Even when condensed to two paragraphs, you can see the potential land mines Rick Scott, a Republican running for governor, might face over his former hospital chain, Columbia/HCA.Paragraph 1. Scott grew Columbia/HCA into the nation's biggest hospital system. It then became the center of a multi-state federal investigation in 1997 that centered around whether Columbia/HCA defrauded Medicare and Medicaid. Scott resigned under pressure in 1997 as the scope of the investigation grew.Paragraph 2. Columbia/HCA eventually settled the fraud cases, paying a record-setting $1.7 billion in fines. The company pleaded guilty to at least 14 corporate felonies. Four people also were indicted; two were convicted, but those convictions were overturned on appeal. Scott himself was not indicted or questioned in the case.Largest fine ever. $1.7 billion. Resigned under pressure.A third-party group, the Alliance for America’s Future, has crafted a 30-second ad attacking Scott's record at Columbia/HCA. And there's a baiting Twitter account, ScottFraudFiles, being pushed by supporters of Bill McCollum, Scott's Republican primary rival.The attacks are being countered by Scott, who has deep pockets and already has spent millions of dollars on television advertisements.Scott launched a website, www.truthaboutrickscott.com, to refute claims about his time leading Columbia/HCA. He also is up with a new television ad called ""Truth,"" where Scott challenges McCollum on the Columbia/HCA story. Looking directly into the camera, here's what Scott says: Bill McCollum’s been in politics for 30 years. You’d think he’d want to talk about his record. Instead he’s just attacking me. That’s what career politicians do.I’m going to do something the politicians never will, give you the unvarnished truth.The McCollum crowd says the hospital company I started was fined by the government for Medicare fraud.Unfortunately, that’s true.I wasn’t ever charged or even questioned by the authorities, but that’s not what matters. What matters is that the company made mistakes. And as CEO I take responsibility and I learned from it.Now here’s the part McCollum leaves out:Two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were our hospitals.Our hospitals earned the highest quality rating, 4 times the national average.We had the best care at the lowest prices for our patients.If you want a career politician, go with McCollum…But if you want someone who learns, leads, and demands accountability … I’m Rick Scott, let’s get to work. Since this is a Florida campaign, we decided to check Scott's claim that two-thirds of the top-rated hospitals in Florida were owned by Columbia/HCA.(First, a note. We love seeing fact-check journalism and noticed that Michael Putney of WPLG in Miami dissected the Alliance for America’s Future ad and, to a lesser extent, Scott's rebuttal that we're analyzing here. We think you should check out his report. It starts about 35 seconds in.)Scott's campaign said the claim about Columbia/HCA's Florida hospitals comes from a December 1995 article in a health care trade publication, Modern Healthcare.The article references a 1994 study of America's hospital system. The study, performed by Health Care Investment Analysts and William Mercer, rates hospitals in terms of cost efficiency and patient outcomes -- measuring mortality rates, length of stays for patients, the number of employees needed to treat a patient, occupancy rates and financial performance.HCIA and and William Mercer then create a list of the nation's Top 100 hospitals. The list is subdivided by the type of hospital -- rural, urban, teaching hospital, etc.""Of the 17 hospitals from Florida in the top 100, 12 are in one category: nonteaching hospitals of more than 250 beds. All are Columbia hospitals,"" the Modern Healthcare article says.The article mentions that one of the 12 was purchased by Columbia/HCA after the study was performed, so really it's 11 out of 17. That's 65 percent, or right around what Scott mentioned in his ad.We checked subsequent years of the study and found similar results.In 1995, the same study rated 13 Florida hospitals among the Top 100. Nine of those hospitals were Columbia/HCA properties, or 69 percent.Twelve of 17 Top 100 Florida hospitals (70.5 percent) were run by Columbia/HCA in 1996, according to the same study.That's all right in line with what Scott said, but it fails to account for those big land mines we mentioned earlier.If the study measures financial performance, for instance, did Columbia/HCA hospitals rank artificially because it defrauded Medicare and Medicaid?We turned to one of the authors of the study, Jean Chenoweth, to find out. Chenoweth now works for Thomson Reuters, which continues to publish the annual hospital survey.We asked: Had you and the study group known about Columbia/HCA's Medicare fraud investigation -- would that have affected the rankings?She said: ""We can’t give a definitive answer to a hypothetical question. Our policy calls for us to rescind any 100 Top Hospital Award found to have been given on the basis of inaccurate data. Columbia/HCA settled its case, so we have no proof or admission that specific data that led to a specific hospital receiving a 100 Top Hospital Award was inaccurate. That makes this difficult to answer definitively.""Chenoweth's answer muddies things a bit in our minds.Because the corporate fraud charges were settled, there never was a public airing of the specific allegations. And because there was never a public airing of the specific allegations -- and a finding of guilt -- the study authors were unable to see if the figures they measured were deemed fraudulent. It's also important to note that the study was focused on the outcomes of individual hospitals while the federal investigation centered around dozens of Columbia/HCA properties.Where does this leave us?In his ad ""Truth,"" Scott certainly cites the Top 100 hospital report correctly when he says that two-thirds of the Florida hospitals to make the list were owned by Columbia/HCA. But he glosses over the fact that those rankings could at least be questioned because fraud-laden data may have been used in the analysis to make the rating.The author of the study doesn't know if the data was accurate or cooked, because the fraud case never went to trial.We found no evidence to say the rankings are bogus, but we think the claim could use a little additional information. To us, that correlates to a rating of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096DEE640>],/factchecks/2010/jun/04/rick-scott/rick-scott-former-healthcare-ceo-defends-columbiah/

Challenger to GOP chair says Democrats have 20 field agents, Republicans have none
","Republicans hold all 29 statewide elected offices in Texas. Check. Plus, no Republican has lost statewide since ‘94, Republicans hold solid majorities in the Texas Senate and Texas congressional delegation and the GOP could widen its edge in the Texas House in November’s elections. Check, check, check and (maybe) check. Such pro-Republican realities didn’t deter a candidate for the chairmanship of the Republican Party of Texas from sending out a press release May 27 generally charging the current chair, Cathie Adams of Dallas, with poor management. Tom Mechler of Amarillo also let loose with this: “The Democrats have over 20 field agents to our 0.” Really? The GOP's forces outnumbered? Before imagining wild scenarios—operatives speeding country roads, texting on the straightaways—keep in mind that a political “field agent” is simply a person entrusted with representing a party, interest group or candidate in a region or community. Agents are an entity’s eyes and ears, expected to track what matters to local residents and to fan support for their client in election years, like this one. Responding to our inquiry, Mechler spokesman Russ Duerstine, a member of the State Republican Executive Committee, told us the state GOP let its only field organizer go early this year, a claim that a party spokesman declined to address. Later, Mechler said he reached his count, which he called an estimate, by looking at Texas-based workers for Republican and Democratic political groups, which seemed like a reasonable methodology. Starting our own check, we perused the major parties' websites. The Texas Democratic Party site lists 19 staff members though no one with a title indicating they work outside of its Austin headquarters. The state GOP’s site lists six staff members, likewise no one with a title suggesting they’re in the field. Next, we contacted the parties. GOP spokesman Bryan Preston declined comment on the party's field staff, while Kirsten Gray, spokeswoman for the Democrats, said in an email the party now has no field staffers but some staff members occasionally go into the field. End of story? Not. In April 2009, the Democratic National Committee dispatched an organizer, Luke Hayes, to Texas to direct the state’s chapter of Organizing for America, the national group that succeeded then-Sen. Barack Obama’s 2008 presidential campaign committee, Obama for America. At the time, the Austin American-Statesman said there was speculation in Democratic circles about the national party putting up to 30 organizers into Republican-leaning Texas. That apparently hasn’t happened, though an Austin Democratic activist, Eugene Sepulveda, posted a blog in August saying he’d attended an event including “12 or 14” Texas-based OFA field organizers. Hector Nieto, spokesman for Organizing for America – Texas, declined to say how many staffers are in the state. Separately, though, we looked through DNC financial filings with the Federal Election Commission. The committee’s “disbursements” filing for April, the latest report available, shows salaries paid to 11 individuals with Texas addresses; add Hayes, whose listed address is in the Bronx, and there appear to have been 12 DNC-paid staff members in the state. According to the filing, those payees were spread among Austin, Houston, Brownsville, Dallas, El Paso, Garland, La Feria and Lorena. A similar filing by the Republican National Committee revealed no committee-paid Texas workers in April, though a Dallas resident was paid consulting, speaking and training fees. So, the count of D-vs.-R organizers appears to be 12 to 0. But hold on. State Comptroller Susan Combs, a Republican seeking her third term in November, has announced she'll be helming the GOP's election-year get-out-the-vote committee, dubbed Victory 2010. On the Republican side, such committees usually enlist field staff. The GOP's 2008 ""victory"" committee paid six field workers, according to Leanne Ivey, that committee's senior adviser. Ivey said the workers were based in Fort Worth, Dallas, Houston (which had two), San Antonio and Central Texas. And Democrats have more afoot as well. The Texas Democratic Trust and Lone Star Fund funnel money to pro-Democratic groups. For the six months that ended Dec. 31, we identified about a dozen individuals or companies with Texas addresses that fielded payments from at least one of the entities, according to finance reports filed with the state and federal government. But no recipients were precisely listed as field staff. Finally, we’d be remiss if we overlooked field-staff hirings by the party’s well-funded candidates for governor. GOP Gov. Rick Perry’s campaign told us he has 10 regional field directors. Democratic nominee Bill White’s campaign didn’t volunteer its field staff level. Spokeswoman Katy Bacon said in an email: “That’s competitive information, kind of like the recipe for Dr Pepper.” We visited again with Mechler, who said for his count, he assumed that 75 percent of the individuals funded in Texas by the Lone Star Fund and Texas Democratic Trust were field workers. He stood by his 20-to-0 ratio, calling it a fair estimate. We're comfortable saying Democrats have up to a dozen people working in the field. And the state GOP has no one. Also, it's possible some workers in both parties aren't identified as field staff in finance reports. It's also likely that future hires will change the ratio of ground troops.  Based on available information, Mechler is right about his party for now, but overstates Democratic Party numbers. We rate his statement Half True. ",[<zip object at 0x00000280976FA340>],/factchecks/2010/jun/04/tom-mechler/challenger-gop-chair-says-democrats-have-20-field-/

Rubio says Crist vetoed his own item
","Republican U.S. Senate candidate Marco Rubio wants voters to see his independent opponent Gov. Charlie Crist as a repeat flip-flopper who vetoed a project out of political spite. In one of Rubio's most recent claims, posted to his campaign website June 2, 2010, he says that Crist ""bizarrely vetoed"" $9.7 million for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida ""despite having previously argued the budget request had merit.""Here is what Rubio wrote:""For his latest astounding flip-flop, Charlie Crist on Friday vetoed nearly $9.7 million in state funding for a teaching hospital at the University of Florida despite having included the funding as part of his budget recommendation in January. As part of his proposed budget for Fiscal Year 2010-2011, Charlie Crist’s office even wrote a justification for the budget request that can be read HERE. Yet, Crist bizarrely vetoed the funding despite having previously argued that the budget request had merit. Was this political payback for Republican leaders no longer supporting him? Is there anything else that could explain a seemingly inexplicable flip-flop?""There is no dispute that Crist vetoed $9,673,569 for Shands teaching hospital -- line item 185. The veto on May 28 was one of about $371 million in budget vetoes. So the only question is if he had ""previously argued the budget request had merit.""Some background: Shands at UF is a teaching hospital in Gainesville that serves many uninsured patients and draws patients from throughout the state. In the last fiscal year, Shands UF provided about $49 million in unreimbursed financial assistance. But Crist's veto could cost the hospital at least $12 million in matching federal funds, according to a June 2 article in the Gainesville Sun.Now, some political context leading up to Crist's veto. Crist included $9,673,569 for Shands in his recommended budget that was released in January. When he proposed his budget, Crist -- a Republican at the time -- was in a battle for the Republican Senate primary with former House Speaker Rubio. During the spring legislative session, his relationship with some Republicans soured over disagreements about abortion, teacher tenure and other issues. He found himself lagging behind Rubio in the polls and announced April 29 that he would ditch the GOP and run as an independent. So that means Crist was an independent by veto day.Rubio provides links to Crist's budget request for the hospital funding. It includes the appropriation bill showing the money for Shands hospital.Shands officials were surprised by the veto.""We had no idea this was coming,"" Shands spokeswoman Kim Rose said in a June 3 interview. ""We had not been asked any questions about it. This appropriation was included in his last three budgets and he had recommended it for this one.""A May 29 press release from Shands stated: ""This line item in the governor’s budget has been in place for three decades and historically has been funded through a recurring general revenue allocation. As one of the state’s largest charity care providers, these state funds were the only source available for Shands at UF to be eligible for additional federal funds since it is not part of a local taxing district.""A May 30 article in the Gainesville Sun, one day after Crist's veto, quoted from a memo written by Shands HealthCare CEO Tim Goldfarb.""Goldfarb said in the memo that the veto was unexpected because Crist had recommended the funding as part of the budget and approved it in his previous three proposed budget plans,'' stated the article. ""Goldfarb added the total impact could be even greater because the state cut could lead to a reduction in federal money."" The Florida Times-Union had a direct link to Goldfarb's memo.Crist spokesman Sterling Ivey told Health News Florida and the Gainesville Sun that the governor vetoed the money because it was targeted at a single hospital and no other hospitals received the same type of additional funding. Crist wrote in his May 28 veto message that his budget would protect the most vulnerable -- though he vetoed money for Shands, a hospital that serves many poor patients.""While economic recovery is on the horizon, General Revenue dollars are still scarce and spending has to be carefully prioritized to provide the most critical services to the citizens of our state,"" Crist wrote. The governor defended his veto, according to a Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times June 4 article: “The concern was more with the process of it, to be honest with you. And the lateness of it. I didn’t want things that came late and didn’t have the complete committee vetting opportunity.” Crist denied that his veto was political: “It’s motivated by being an appropriate process (and) the economic reality that we’re living in.”Michelle Todd, a spokesperson for Crist's campaign, replied to PolitiFact Florida in an e-mail: ""The majority of the budget provides funding for essential state services, protects our most vulnerable, keeps our citizens safe and provides for education of our children. As stipulated in the Governor's budget signing letter on May 28, 2010, he directed staff '...to provide a thorough review of each item in the budget. Through this process we have identified projects in the budget that were inserted late in the process; funded outside of established processes; and earmarked funds benefiting a select group or geographic region.' The Shands Teaching Hospital line item falls into this last category and is the only Teaching Hospital in the state receiving a distinct general revenue recurring line item in the General Appropriations Act. While it is true that this item was contained in previous Governor's Recommended Budgets, the current economy and outlook for the near future dictated a thorough review of all projects."" It's clear that Crist vetoed $9.7 million for Shands, though it had previously been in his budget. His campaign argues that Florida's weak economy led to the veto decision.

VoteVets.org claims cap and trade bill would halve oil consumption
","A recent TV ad from the left-leaning VoteVets.org, which represents American veterans, takes a circuitous route to its real agenda: a plug for the American Power Act, the latest version of the cap-and-trade bill introduced on May 12, 2010, by Sens. John Kerry, D-Mass., and Joe Lieberman, I-Conn.

The ad begins with nasty images from the oil gusher in the Gulf of Mexico.

Then we are introduced to Evan Wolf, a Louisiana National Guardsman who was assigned to Gulf Coast clean up.

""When I signed on to the National Guard, I did it to help protect Americans from our enemies, like in the Persian Gulf, not to clean up an oil company's mess here in the Gulf of Mexico,"" Wolf says.

He holds up a freezer bag filled with a murky goop.

""We'll do whatever mission we're given and do it well,"" Wolf says. ""But America needs a new mission. Because whether it's deep drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas, our dependence on oil is threatening our national security.

""Thing is, a clean American energy plan would cut our dependence on oil in half. It's more power for America, made here in America. Putting our people to work using all the resources we have.""

We then get images of solar and wind farms.

""Some folks in Washington say now is not the time to clean American power,"" Wolf says, and then dabs at oil staining a Louisiana beach. ""I've gotta ask -- if not now … when?"" By way of background, Wolf was a Democratic candidate for the Louisiana House in 2007. He lost, but a Democratic National Committee web page suggests he's at least mulling another run.

VoteVets explained that the ad is advocating for the American Power Act, and that it is that bill that ""would cut our dependence on oil in half."" That's the claim we are checking here.

The American Power Act is the latest version of the cap and trade bill that aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Obama put in a plug for the bill in a speech on June 2, 2010, in Pittsburgh. ""The time has come, once and for all, for this nation to fully embrace a clean energy future,"" Obama said, and vowed it would become an administration priority. ""The votes may not be there right now, but I intend to find them in the coming months,"" Obama said.

VoteVets backs up the ad's claim that the American Power Act would ""cut our dependence on oil in half"" by citing a 2009 analysis from the National Resources Defense Council of the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, which was passed by the House on June 26, 2009. The bill sought to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through a variety of market-based (cap-and-trade) mechanisms, incentives for energy efficiency and the development of clean energy.

The Council's report on the House bill last year concluded that if the bill passed, America's dependence on foreign oil would be cut in half by 2050. But the same report projected that while oil imports would be halved, overall oil consumption would drop by about 12 percent between 2010 and 2050 (from 17.1 million barrels per day to 15 million barrels per day in 2050).

We note that in the ad, Wolf doesn't say the bill would cut consumption of foreign oil in half, it says the bill would ""cut our dependence on oil in half."" There's a difference. VoteVets, which is backing the video with a $1.5 million ad buy, contends the context of the ad makes clear that they are talking about oil imports, but we don't agree. The ad is set against the backdrop of an oil drilling catastrophe in the Gulf of Mexico. In his setup, Wolf frames the discussion as ""whether it's deep drilling oil out here, or spending a billion dollars a day on oil from our enemies overseas."" That seems to us like he's talking about oil consumption in general and the need for the United States to ween off it. Reducing dependence on foreign oil would not reduce drilling in the Gulf of Mexico.

It's also worth noting that the government did an analysis of the 2009 House version of the bill and didn't paint quite as rosy a picture as the Council. The U.S. Energy Information Administration would only project to 2030 (not 2050). But the EIA's report projected relatively little change in overall liquid fuel consumption. The report did forecast that U.S. dependence on foreign oil imports would decline, from 8.26 million barrels per day in 2010 to 6.3 million barrels per day in 2030. That's a roughly 24 percent decrease.

But the report also projected a decline in foreign oil imports even without the bill. There are a numbers of reasons for that, said Jonathan Cogan, spokesman for U.S. Energy Information Administration: a slight increase in domestic oil production; increased use of bio-fuels; tighter fuel efficiency standards; and an expected rise in oil prices.

The EIA has not yet finished its analysis of the American Power Act, Cogan noted, though it should be completed in mid to late June. The goals of the Senate bill and last year's House bill may be the same, but the mechanisms are a little different, so using the EIA report on the 2009 House bill to judge the 2010 Senate bill is an ""imperfect comparison,"" Cogan said.

However, Daniel Lashof, director of the Council's Climate Center, said the basic provisions are similar enough that the 2009 analyses are legitimate. Therefore, he said, the Council is comfortable with the projection that the American Power Act has the potential to reduce America's dependence on foreign oil by 50 percent by 2050.

Lashof said part of the reason the Council's projections differed from the EIA's is that EIA did not account for the potential boost to domestic oil production by capturing carbon dioxide from power plants. Recovered carbon dioxide -- encouraged by the bill -- can be injected into depleted oil fields to enhance oil production, Lashof said. As a result, he said, the NRDC projects a slight increase in domestic oil production between now and 2050 under the bill, but in a safer way ""not subject to the kinds of risks of going into deeper and deeper water offshore.""

In summary, the ad claims that if the American Power Act is passed, it would ""cut our dependence on oil in half."" VoteVets says they were talking about cutting dependence on foreign oil in half. And they point to a credible report from the Council that projects a similar bill would cut foreign oil imports in half by 2050. A spokesman for the EIA says basing a projection of the effect of the 2010 Senate bill on an analysis of a similar, but different, 2010 Senate bill is an ""imperfect comparison.""

We also note that the EIA's analysis of the 2009 House version of the bill is less optimistic than the NRDC. But most significantly, we think the context of the ad suggests Wolf is talking about cutting overall oil consumption -- not just foreign oil imports -- in half. If they were only talking about oil imports, why would Wolf be standing on an oil-stained beach in Louisiana? Perhaps newer reports will ultimately back up the VoteVets claim, but they based their claim on a 2009 report that actually projects a much smaller reduction in overall oil consumption. And so we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809739EC40>],/factchecks/2010/jun/03/votevetsorg/votevetsorg-claims-cap-and-trade-bill-would-halve-/

Supporters and opponents of bills to legalize same-sex marriage argued for more than 12 straight hours recently before the Rhode Island Senate’s Judiciary Committee. One of the many issues on which they disagreed was the consequences, if any, of same-sex couples raising children. 
""It's true some people claim that it doesn't make a difference whether a child is raised by a mother and father or whether she's raised by adults engaged in homosexual lifestyles,"" said Susan Yoshihara, director of research at the Catholic Family and Human Rights Institute, who testified against same-sex marriage. 
""Some go even further and say that two lesbians might make better parents than a mother and a father, and there was a study that came out a few years ago that pointed to that effect as well. But any scholarly basis for those claims has been shattered by the latest and best social science and research."" 
We wondered what recent research she was referring to and whether it really ""shattered"" previous findings. 
First, some background. According to the 2010 Census, there were 131,729 same-sex married households and 514,735 unmarried same-sex households in the United States. 
Thirty-one percent of the married couples and almost 14 percent of the unmarried couples said they were raising children. Nearly 2 million children under age 18 were being raised by at least one gay or lesbian parent, the census estimated. 
There have been numerous peer-reviewed studies of same-sex couples raising children. 
Supporters of same-sex marriage say one of the best grew out of the National Longitudinal Lesbian Family Study, which, since 1986, has been following 154 lesbian mothers who had children through artificial insemination. 
Researchers questioned 39 boys and 39 girls raised by those couples and compared responses with those of equal numbers of boys and girls raised by a mother and father. Their findings were published in 2012 in the Journal of Developmental & Behavioral Pediatrics. 
""Our results revealed that the [children of the lesbian couples] rated themselves comparably to their counterparts in opposite-sex parent families in"" quality of life, the study concluded. 
In March 2013, the 60,000-member American Academy of Pediatrics announced it supports same-sex marriage. In its journal, Pediatrics, it said that ""extensive data from more than 30 years of research reveal that children raised by gay and lesbian parents have demonstrated resilience with regard to social, psychological, and sexual health despite economic and legal disparities and social stigma."" 
SO WHAT WAS the research that, according to Yoshihara, changed the landscape of scholarly thinking on the issue, shattering the past studies? 
We contacted Yoshihara, who provided links to two recent studies. 
One was by Mark Regnerus, an associate professor of sociology at the University of Texas-Austin. 
Regnerus’ study, published in July 2012 in Social Science Research, asserted that many previous studies finding ""no notable disadvantages"" and/or ""no differences"" for children raised in same-sex families relied on sample sizes that were too small or were biased. And he said they often relied on interviews of the same-sex parents, not the children. 
Regnerus’  New Family Structures Study used a questionnaire on a range of topics to interview just under 3,000 people ages 18 to 39 and asserted that some outcomes were worse for children of same-sex parents. It compared the children of ""lesbian mothers"" and ""gay fathers"" with the children of ""intact"" heterosexual couples. 
The study looked at everything from whether the children had thought about suicide to whether they voted in the last presidential election. It found, for instance, that the children of lesbian mothers were more likely to be have been in therapy, a link that was not true for children of gay fathers. 
Yoshihara also cited a paper by Loren Marks, a professor at Louisiana State University, which Social Science Research also published online in July 2012, which raised similar criticisms of previous studies. 
THE REGNERUS STUDY'S methods and conclusions touched off a firestorm of criticism from same-sex marriage supporters and from social scientists from around the country. 
Two hundred researchers signed a letter to Social Science Research, attacking the ""intellectual merit"" of the Regnerus study. 
James D. Wright, editor-in-chief of Social Science Research, asked yet another scholar on the journal’s editorial board to review the Regnerus study and determine whether it was proper to have published it. 
That scholar, Darren E. Sherkat, a Southern Illinois University sociology professor, found many shortcomings. Among them: the Regnerus study included among its gay parents people who had a same-sex relationship at any time, even if it was one experience and even if the people involved did not raise the child together. 
Sherkat was also asked to review the companion paper by Marks and he concluded it was essentially a review of other studies and ""inappropriate for a journal that published original quantitative research."" 
Sherkat also found that reviewers of both papers failed to disclose conflicts of interest, including being paid consultants on the Regnerus study. 
""Both papers have serious flaws and distortions that were not simply ignored, but lauded in the reviews,"" Sherkat wrote. 
Meanwhile, 27 scholars from various universities signed a letter defending the Regnerus study. 
SO WHERE ARE WE in this academic free-for-all? 
Two things are clear: 
* There is a sharp division among scholars and advocates over the issue of same-sex parenting 
* The Regnerus study hasn’t been widely accepted as ""the best"" research on the topic and has not reordered the social-science world in the way Yoshihara suggests. 

Wright, the Social Science Research editor-in-chief, put it best: 
""I would regard ‘shattered by the latest and best social science research’ as something of an overstatement,"" he said in an e-mail 
A prudent scholar, he said, would conclude that ""the question is by no means settled, either by the literature as a whole or by the Regnerus study, the latter having far too many problems and issues to be considered ‘definitive.’"" 
We rule Yoshihara’s claim  False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973A3280>],/factchecks/2013/apr/07/susan-yoshihara/same-sex-marriage-foe-says-latest-research-has-sha/
"['Oregon', 'Bipartisanship', 'Congress', 'Taxes', 'Ron Wyden']","
Did Wyden write the 'first bipartisan tax reform bill' in 25 years?
","
U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore.,held a press event in Portland last week to promote a tax reform bill he’s co-authored with a Republican from Indiana. Wyden said that taxpayers now have to go through ""bureaucratic water torture"" to do their taxes. 
The rules are such a complicated mish-mash that many people need professional help to file their returns.   
""It simply doesn't have to be this way. I serve on the Senate Finance Committee. I've authored the first bipartisan tax reform bill in a quarter-century. This is with Sen. Dan Coats, the Republican from Indiana,"" Wyden said. 
The first bipartisan tax reform bill in 25 years? PolitiFact Oregon thought the statement a pretty bold claim to make. Don’t people elected to Congress like to write up laws? We started digging.   
The context: 
The last time the federal government overhauled the tax code was in 1986, when Republican Ronald Reagan was in office and the parties split control of Congress, much like today. Wyden, who was elected to Congress in 1980 and to the Senate in 1996, has talked often about the need to revisit the bipartisan spirit of that time. 
Wyden wants to simplify and streamline the tax code. He says he also wants to lower the burden on families and small businesses. Wyden first proposed an overhaul in 2010, pairing with Sen. Judd Gregg, R-N.H. After Gregg left office, Wyden partnered with Coats in 2011 and plans to introduce the legislation again this year. 
The analysis: 
We asked Tom Towslee, a Wyden spokesman, to back up the senator’s assertion. Towslee said the office had checked with the Congressional Research Service, the body’s nonpartisan research arm, and was told of a 1995 plan sponsored by Sens. Sam Nunn, D-Ga, and Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
That plan would have replaced the income tax with a consumption tax, which Towslee said is not the same as a comprehensive reform plan. ""I think you’ll agree that reforming the current income tax code to make it fairer, simpler and more efficient is very different from replacing it outright with something else,"" he said. 
We turned to the Tax Foundation, a Washington, D.C., think tank. President Scott Hodge checked with his staff and they also came upon the Domenici-Nunn ""USA Tax Act"" of 1995. (Tax bills in 1990, 1997, 2001, 2002 and 2003 may have had some crossover appeal, but these were bills to raise and lower tax rates, and not to address the tax code in a comprehensive way.) 
""It may be a stretch, but not a big one,"" Hodge said of Wyden’s claim. ""What Wyden cares about is re-creating the bipartisanship that brought about the 1986 bill. He may not be the first, but he is in small company."" 
We checked a database of Congressional bills. We found numerous bills, often introduced over multiple sessions, for a flat tax or for a fair share tax, sponsored by Democrats or Republicans, but not both. We also found several efforts to do away with the Internal Revenue Service, some with a Democrat or two on board with Republicans. For example, H.R. 352, introduced in January, is a four-page document that terminates the IRS Code of 1986 in Section 2 and calls for a new federal tax system in Section 3. It is skimpy on details. 
We also caught up with Jane Gravelle, the senior specialist at Congressional Research Service who assisted Wyden’s office. She’s been there 40 years, done tons of research in the area and could not locate legislation similar to the 1986 effort other than Wyden’s. She does not consider the Nunn-Domenici effort a general income tax reform bill on par with Wyden’s bill. 
""I would also add that formulating and actually putting a major tax reform bill into legislative language is a major undertaking, not something that can be done easily and quickly,"" she said in an email. 
Indeed, Wyden’s bill runs 120 pages. Apparently we were mistaken in thinking that lawmakers like to draft lengthy, complicated legislation on the tax code. The bills are rare. 
The ruling: 
Some politicians call the tinkering of tax rates ""tax reform."" We don’t buy that. Some people consider the Nunn-Domenici bill of 1995 a bipartisan tax reform bill. We can see why Wyden’s office, with back-up from the research service, would differentiate his plan from their plan. 
Still, the 1995 effort merits a mention as additional information missing from an otherwise accurate statement. We rule the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B9B680>],/factchecks/2013/apr/06/ron-wyden/did-wyden-write-first-bipartisan-tax-reform-bill-2/
"['New Hampshire', 'Health Care', 'New Hampshire Democratic Party']","
NH Dems say Obamacare is already helping people save money and live heathier
","
Federal health care reform won’t start in earnest until this autumn, but on the third anniversary of the law that gave us Obamacare, the New Hampshire Democratic Party wanted to make sure that the public knew about all the benefits the law already has produced. In an interestingly worded press release, NHDP Communications Director Harrell Kirstein tallied the gains since 2010. 
Kirstein began his release by stating ""Health care reform has helped Granite Staters save money and live healthier lives."" His list of evidence began with a bullet point declaring the Affordable Care Act ""Expanded preventative care coverage with no cost-sharing for 365,000 Granite Staters with private health insurance in 2012, including 253,000 women. While more than 160,000 New Hampshire citizen[s] on traditional Medicare also accessed free preventative care services."" 
The numbers Kirstein cites are based on an administration analysis that takes the national level findings of an independent group, the Kaiser Family Foundation, and applies them to various groups of insured people in New Hampshire. 
As PolitiFact has noted before, there is a complicated relationship among preventive care, costs and health. The quick assumption that an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure can be wrong. 
When President Obama said ""preventive care saves money,"" PolitiFact ruled that statement False. Obama was speaking about the health care system as a whole, and there’s a lot of evidence that when millions of healthy people use preventive services, their health status remains the same, but all those doctor visits add up to higher costs. 
A 2008 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that, in some cases, preventive care can save money and improve health. Counseling people to quit smoking, eat a better diet, and giving the most common vaccinations provide a win-win outcome of low cost and avoiding diseases that are expensive to treat. 
But the authors cautioned ""Sweeping statements about the cost-saving potential of prevention, however, are overreaching. Studies have concluded that preventing illness can in some cases save money but in other cases can add to health care costs."" 
""Although some preventive measures do save money, the vast majority reviewed in the health economics literature do not."" 
And whether preventive services lead to better health is also debatable. Preventive services absolutely can make a person healthier when a potential problem is diagnosed early and treated. However, preventive care on a system-wide level leads to batteries of tests and procedures that lead to positive outcomes for a few, but make little difference for many.    
A study by Danish researchers on the value of annual physicals found that they did little or nothing to reduce the risk of dying from cancer or heart disease. 
In addition, Ateev Mehrotra at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine estimated the yearly cost of routine physical exams at $8 billion. He said the limited benefits ""underline the need to maintain other means of delivering preventive care beyond annual [physicals]."" 
The key finding from all the studies is prevention makes sense when it is targeted. The right strategy picks out the people at risk and offers them the screening or prevention treatment they need. In general, that is the approach in Obamacare. 
The online journal Health Affairs notes that Section 2713 of the Affordable Care Act is ""one of the most straightforward provisions"" in the legislation. The law requires services that are backed up by evidence and have been rated by certain bodies, such as the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force. 
""Items and services are rated by the Preventive Services Task Force only with respect to individuals who fit into certain categories determined by age, gender, or medical conditions or risks,"" the author writes, ""and the rule only requires that services be provided to individuals in those categories."" 
Take something as common as cholesterol levels. Under the Task Force guidelines, not everyone would get tested for free; the federal recommendations specify men 35 and older, and women and men of any age with heart disease or risk factors for heart disease. 
Even the most targeted regime of preventive services comes with two caveats. By one estimate published in Health Affairs, if 90 percent of Americans took advantage of the most proven services, overall spending would decline by just 0.2 percent. The health benefits would be ""huge"", but the added doctor visits and tests would cause insurance premiums to rise, by as much at 1.5 percent. 
At the end of the day, the author writes,"" increased benefits will be accompanied by increased costs, but neither will be dramatic and an accurate understanding of which will be greater is simply not possible."" 
Our ruling 
The New Hampshire Democratic Party claimed that health care reform helped people save money and lead healthier lives. Its list began with better access and use of preventive care. The statement brushes over the mixed outcomes of preventive services.  They can lead to better health for some, but can also result in batteries of tests that have little health effect for many. Likewise, the Affordable Care Act requires many preventive procedures be offered at no cost to patients, which can save individuals some money, but on a system-wide basis many of those practices are wasteful and they always come at some cost. We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971A6A40>],/factchecks/2013/apr/05/new-hampshire-democratic-party/nh-dems-say-obamacare-already-helping-people-save-/

Group says Monsanto law skirts courts, requires approval of genetically engineered seeds
","
Have you heard of the Monsanto Protection Act? 
That’s the name critics have assigned to a section of the continuing resolution which Congress passed and President Barack Obama signed on March 20, 2013, that keeps the federal government operating through the end of the fiscal year. 
Tucked into Section 735 of the law is a provision relating to the regulation of genetically engineered crops that has food safety activists up in arms. 
We’ve seen a number of claims about this legislation, on Facebook in particular. This one, from the group Grow Food, Not Lawns, caught our eye: 
The law ""requires the USDA to approve the harvest and sale of crops from genetically modified seed even if a court has ruled against the crop as being dangerous to public safety or the environment."" 
That’s a hefty statement about a hot issue. We decided to look further. 
Sugar beets and the regulatory process 
Missouri-based Monsanto is the world’s largest producer of genetically engineered seeds, which are regulated by the USDA. The agency is required, under the National Environmental Policy Act or NEPA, to study them for environmental impacts, such as their effect on other crops and their risk of becoming a pest plant. (The USDA does not assess the seeds in terms of food safety -- that’s the job of the FDA and is not addressed in this law.) 
This process landed in court in 2009, when Monsanto petitioned for approval of a sugar beet genetically engineered to be resistant to a Monsanto brand of herbicide. The USDA conducted a preliminary environmental study that found that the beet’s introduction into agriculture would have no significant impact on the environment and gave its approval. The Center for Food Safety sued USDA, saying it had not completed an adequate NEPA review, and the courts agreed, sending USDA back to complete the study. 
It’s important to note that the court ruling didn’t say the beets were unsafe; it simply said that an adequate environmental review hadn’t been done. 
""It took USDA more than a year to do the analysis, but farmers were growing these sugar beets,"" said Greg Jaffe with the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""USDA issued temporary permits while they continued the analysis, with conditions to ensure it didn’t impact the environment. They had the discretion to do that."" 
Ultimately, Jaffe said, USDA finished its study and approved the crop. 
So, what’s new? 
The attachment in the budget bill, known as a ""rider,"" essentially puts into law the practice described in the sugar beet case. 
""The language in Section 735 codifies existing USDA authority and elements of a 2010 Supreme Court ruling that lower courts should not automatically prohibit the planting of biotech crop varieties, or the harvest and sale of biotech crops already planted, if/when their commercial use is temporarily banned because of a lawsuit,"" said Karen Batra, spokeswoman for the Biotech Industry Organization. ""This applies to products that have ALREADY gone through the approval process and already been deregulated by FDA and therefore deemed to be safe for human health and the environment. If the secretary believes that the crop at issue poses a risk in any way, he can forbid its use."" 
Jaffe added, ""I don’t think it provides USDA with any new legal authority that they didn’t already have, although clearly it’s Congress telling USDA that they should use that authority wherever possible."" 
The text of the law says ""In the event that a determination of nonregulated status made pursuant to section 411 of the Plant Protection Act is or has been invalidated or vacated, the Secretary of Agriculture shall, notwithstanding any other provision of law, upon request by a farmer, grower, farm operator, or producer, immediately grant temporary permit(s) or temporary deregulation..."" 
The words -- ""shall immediately grant"" -- are alarming activists who are already suspicious of genetically modified products dominating the food supply. 
""It goes a step beyond by forcing the agency to approve those permits or partial deregulation,"" said Colin O’Neil, director of government affairs at the Center for Food Safety, the group that filed suit in the sugar beet case. ""There’s an urgency written into the law that is going to stifle sound science and science-based regulation."" 
""It kind of takes the courts out of the game,"" added Patty Lovera of the group Food and Water Watch. 
Jaffe, however, noted that the USDA would still have to adhere to existing guidelines in the approval process, such as ensuring that products comply with the Plant Protection Act. 
When we contacted the USDA about this claim, a spokesman sent us this statement: 
""(Agriculture) Secretary (Tom) Vilsack has asked the Office of General Counsel to review this provision as it appears to pre-empt judicial review of a deregulatory action, which may make the provision unenforceable."" 
Our ruling 
The group Grow Food, Not Lawns claimed that the budget bill ""requires the USDA to approve the harvest and sale of crops from genetically modified seed even if a court has ruled against the crop as being dangerous to public safety or the environment."" 
We learned from experts that the USDA issuing temporary permits for products in litigation is not new with this law. That was already the agency’s practice. And in the sugar beet case that went to court, the dispute was not over the safety of the food but the environmental review procedure. 
However, the language in the law saying the USDA ""shall"" issue permits escalates that policy, with one expert telling us it ""compels"" the agency to allow the use of disputed products while litigation proceeds. And now the USDA itself is now questioning whether that provision is enforceable. 
The Facebook claim rightly describes the effect of the new provision, but lacks some important context. We rate it Half True.

"['Regulation', 'Texas', 'Guns', 'Lee Leffingwell']","
Lee Leffingwell says polls show 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of NRA members support criminal background checks before all gun buys
","
Joining calls for criminal background checks prior to every U.S. gun purchase, Austin Mayor Lee Leffingwell said the idea is widely popular. 
Ninety percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks, Leffingwell said, the Austin American-Statesman reported in a news article posted online the day he spoke, March 28, 2013. 
Currently, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers but not for gun sales by private sellers. President Barack Obama wants to require criminal background checks for all gun sales. The National Rifle Association, which opposes universal background checks, has suggested that an expansion would fail to rope in criminals. 
As noted in a January 2013 fact check by our colleagues in Washington, Republican pollster Frank Luntz’s organization, Luntz Global, conducted a May 2012 poll of 945 gun owners nationwide, half of whom were gun owners who were ""current or lapsed"" members of the National Rifle Association and half of whom were non-NRA gun owners. It had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. 
Leffingwell aide Amy Everhart said by email that the mayor based his NRA reference on the same poll, as cited by the group that commissioned it,  Mayors Against Illegal Guns. Everhart said Leffingwell also drew his conclusion about other polls from the group, which consists of city mayors concerned with illegal guns and gun violence as helmed by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, an independent, and Boston Mayor Thomas Menino, a Democrat. Its five Texas members include Leffingwell as well as the mayor of neighboring West Lake Hills, Dave Claunch, and Houston Mayor Annise Parker. 
A week before Leffingwell spoke, Everhart pointed out, Bloomberg delivered remarks in New York noting that polls in 41 congressional districts suggest an average of 86 percent to 89 percent of likely voters support universal background checks. ""That’s in line with other recent polls that have found that more than 90 percent of Americans support background checks for all gun buyers,"" Bloomberg said before revisiting the May 2012 poll that reached current and former NRA members. 
That poll found that 82 percent of gun owners were in favor of required background checks, including 74 percent of individuals with current or former memberships in the NRA. 
  
Contacted previously by PolitiFact, the NRA offered no comment on the poll. But the group previously reacted to a 2009 poll taken by Luntz for the mayors’ group by noting that Luntz could not have had access to the association’s confidential membership roll. It also criticized Luntz, a widely quoted communications consultant for Republican politicians and Fortune 100 companies, with decade-old criticism from two polling organizations. The association did not directly challenge the poll results. 
PolitiFact identified two other 2013 polls of gun owners. A Pew Research Center poll taken of 1,502 adults from Jan. 9-13, 2013, found 85 percent of some 529 polled gun owners in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks — nearly identical to the Luntz poll. The gun-owner results had a margin of error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. A CBS/New York Times poll conducted of 1,110 adults from Jan. 11-15, 2013, showed that 85 percent of respondents living in a household with an NRA member supported universal background checks. 
More recently, according to the results of a national January 2013 poll presented in the March 21, 2013, New England Journal of Medicine, 84 percent of gun owners and 74 percent of NRA members supported requiring a universal background-check system for all gun sales. The poll was conducted by GfK Knowledge Networks for researchers led by Colleen L. Barry, an associate professor of health policy and management at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health. 
And what of Americans in general? 
The January Pew poll found 85 percent of all respondents in favor of making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks, with comparable support from Republicans, Democrats and independents, Pew said. The margin of error for the entire sample was 2.9 percentage points. 
The CBS/New York Times poll indicated that 92 percent of all the respondents favor background checks for all potential gun buyers. The poll had an overall margin of error of three percentage points. 
PolitiFact Georgia, looking into a similar claim about support for universal checks, noted a Fox News poll conducted Jan. 15-17, 2013, of 1,008 registered voters. Ninety one percent of respondents said they favor ""requiring criminal background checks on all gun buyers, including those buying at gun shows and private sales."" 
A Quinnipiac University national survey of 772 registered voters, taken Jan. 30 through Feb. 4, 2013, found 92 percent supporting background checks for all gun buyers. The survey, pointed out by Everhart, had a margin of error of 2.3 percentage points. 
A subsequent Quinnipiac University survey, taken of 1,944 registered voters from Feb. 27, 2013 through March 4, 2013, found 88 percent in favor of background checks for all gun buyers. The poll had a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. 
Our ruling 
Austin’s mayor said 90 percent of Americans and 74 percent of National Rifle Association members support universal background checks for gun purchases. 
Polls taken in 2012 and 2013 support both figures, though one taken closest to Leffingwell’s press conference indicates support among all Americans possibly slipping a bit below 90 percent. Also, the 2012 poll he cited for NRA members rolled together responses of current and former/lapsed members. Then again, a 2013 poll similarly suggests that 74 percent of NRA members favor universal background checks. 
We rate this claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F2F380>],/factchecks/2013/apr/04/lee-leffingwell/lee-leffingwell-says-polls-show-90-percent-america/

NRA lobbyist Marion Hammer says rabies vaccine doesn't protect against strains from other states
","
Marion Hammer, 35-year lobbyist of the National Rifle Association, is a powerful force for gun rights in Florida. 
So it surprised us to see her speak up at a Florida Senate committee discussion about, of all topics, animal shelters. 
The measure at hand would require animal shelters and animal control agencies that accept public money to keep records for the cats and dogs they take in and what happens to them. Many facilities don’t keep this kind of data and do not make the information public upon request, making it hard to grasp the scope of rescue efforts, according to a committee analysis of SB 674. 
Hammer is executive director of the United Sportsmen of Florida, an advocacy group she founded that values hunting. Essential to hunting are hunting dogs, which are vulnerable to bites from rabid animals. Animal ""dumping"" by no-kill animal shelters endangers hunting dogs, sheepdogs, cattle dogs, trial dogs and so on, she said. 
She thinks the bill requiring shelters to keep records of their animal intake will lead to accountability and less risk for domestic pets. 
""Most people don't know, for example, that animals that come from other states, like Texas, carry different strains of rabies,"" she told the Senate Community Affairs Committee on April 2. ""And those strains of rabies are entirely different from Florida's, and our vaccines and serums don’t affect those other strains of rabies."" 
Anyone who has watched Old Yeller knows the tragic fate awaiting an unvaccinated family pet infected by a rabid animal. We wondered, though, if Hammer was right about rabies vaccines not being effective against rabid animals from other states. 
Rabid rundown 
The viral disease is passed on through saliva, affecting the brain and eventually leading to death. 
Cases of human rabies are rare in the United States, though humans are most likely to contract the disease from wild mammals, such as bats, skunks, raccoons and foxes, according to the Centers for Disease Control. 
Rabies is preventable by a vaccine made from killed virus. The vaccine is given in a series of three to five shots in the shoulder. For those wondering, the vaccine cannot cause rabies. (Read more about how the vaccine is made here.) 
There are different strains of rabies based on the animal that tends to contract it, and these variants can cross species, said Dr. Kimberly May, a veterinarian and American Veterinary Medicine Association spokeswoman. The canine rabies strain, for example, is no longer in the United States, but dogs and other mammals can still be infected by strains from other animals. 
Moving animals from state to state can increase the risk of bringing in variants of the rabies strain, said Dr. Julie Levy, director of the Maddie’s Shelter Medicine Program at the University of Florida’s College of Veterinary Medicine. 
She pointed to two Florida examples, including in 1994, when rabid coyotes were brought from Texas for foxpen hunting in Florida. It led to an outbreak among unvaccinated hunting dogs, resulting in the vaccinations of 29 people and euthanization of dozens of dogs and wildlife, she said. 
About the vaccine? 
Hammer ""couldn’t be more wrong about rabies,"" May stressed. The protections offered by rabies vaccines do not vary by region. 
""A dog vaccinated against rabies in Florida is also considered vaccinated against rabies in Illinois,"" she said by email. ""Or Texas. Or any other state."" 
Levy agreed, saying the vaccines are highly protective. 
""That is why dogs and cats that are well-vaccinated against rabies are protected against the strains that are carried by wildlife,"" Levy said. ""The bigger risk would be introducing new strains into our wildlife reservoirs, because wildlife is not vaccinated."" 
We posed the question to Dr. Charles Rupprecht, research director for the Global Alliance for Rabies Control. Same answer: ""All licensed human and animal vaccines will protect against all rabies virus variants in the New World."" 
After reading our inquiry, Hammer called her veterinarian. She had checked with him before the meeting to confirm what an Alachua hunting dog breeder told her about varying strains of rabies from Texas. 
But she forgot to ask about the vaccine part. 
""Now they’ve got it worked out so it that vaccine works for just about everyone,"" she said after talking again with her vet. ""I just didn’t take it far enough."" 
Our ruling 
Hammer claimed rabies strains carried by animals in other states ""are entirely different from Florida's, and our vaccines and serums don’t affect those other strains of rabies."" 
Her claim about vaccines was rebutted by veterinarians and disease experts. Even more, she admitted not fleshing out her talking points before the committee meeting. 
We rate her claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C07A540>],/factchecks/2013/apr/04/marion-hammer/nra-lobbyist-marion-hammer-says-rabies-vaccine-doe/

Bloggers say Obama aides are delinquent on their taxes

April 15, the deadline for filing 2012 income tax returns, is almost here, so it was fitting that a claim about income taxes caught our attention the other day. The claim circulated in the blogosphere and some media reports, then showed up in a published letter to the editor of The Plain Dealer. 
The claim: Forty aides who serve President Barack Obama ""owe $333,485 in back taxes."" 
Sounds outrageous, yes? And after checking with the Internal Revenue Service, we can affirm that the claim is factually correct. Yet there is more to the story. , 
It turns out that the issue arises every year, regardless of who is president. And it applies to nearly every department of the federal government. 
""People who work for the federal government are no different from people who work in the private sector or for nonprofits,"" said Kay Bell, a Texas-based author, journalist, blogger (""Don’t Mess With Taxes""), former congressional staffer and current contributing tax editor for BankRate.com. We contacted her because she has written about the government employee delinquencies for years. ""Everybody has tax issues,"" she said. 
Let’s break this down with numbers first, then provide some context. We got the latest numbers in an Excel spreadsheet from an IRS spokesman. His agency developed a reporting method in 1992 to comply with a congressional requirement that it provide annual reports on the tax delinquencies of federal employees. 
In 2011, the last year for which the filing deadline has long passed, 3.62 percent of the civilian federal workforce -- or 107,658 individuals out of 2.97 million federal workers -- had an unresolved federal income tax delinquency. 
This did not include taxpayers who have made arrangements with the IRS to pay off their tax debts. Rather, these are people who have not, cannot or will not pay. 
The numbers we presented so far include only federal civilian employees, not military personnel or retirees, because of the implicit rationale made in criticizing these workers: Those who carry out the regular functions of government ought to be keenly aware of the need to pay their taxes. Altogether, these tax delinquents owed just over $1 billion. 
But if you add active military members, reservists, National Guard and federal retirees, the number of delinquent individuals grows to 311,566,  and the total owed climbs to $3.5 billion. 
Among the major federal departments, the Department of Housing and Urban Development had the highest delinquency rate, 4.42 percent. In exact numbers, 431 HUD employees owed a cumulative $5.9 million. 
Among large independent agencies, workers in the Government Printing Office were the worst tax delinquents: 167 employees, or 7.6 percent of the agency’s workforce, owed back taxes, to the tune of $2.3 million. 
As for the White House, the Executive Office of the President had 40 tax delinquencies out of its 1,902-member staff in 2011, for a rate of 2.10 percent. These employees owed  $333,485 altogether. 
The delinquencies are of concern to some in Congress. But guess what? The House of Representatives and Senate have their own share of people who are behind in their taxes. Their tax delinquency rates are even worse than the White House’s. 
The House, including a staff of 11,812 and 435 lawmakers, had 454 tax delinquents in 2011, owing nearly $8.9 million, giving it a 3.71 percent delinquency rate. That compared with the White House rate (the Executive Office of the President) of 2.10 percent. 
The Senate, with 100 lawmakers and 6,930 staff members, had a rate of 3.33 percent, with 234 individuals owing the IRS $1.9 million. The IRS, alas, does not disclose the names of the deadbeats. 
This may pale compared with the public’s delinquency rate of 8.2 percent, but critics, led by Utah Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz, note that federal workers are paid by taxpayers. As Chaffetz told Fox News’s Greta Van Susteren on March 20, ""if they're not going to pay their taxes, they should be fired!"" 
The only department that may use tax trouble as a reason for dismissal, however, is the IRS, which has an employee tax compliance and auditing program and says it treats indifference to tax laws as a firing offense. Chaffetz would like to extend such treatment to other federal employees. 
This is a lot of information about various departments, lawmakers and the White House. Yet bloggers ignored almost everything but the White House component. 
Consider entries such as this, in the blog Poor Richard’s News: ""Surprise! Obama White House Aids (sic) owe $333,485 in back taxes."" 
And this: 
""40 of Obama’s White House aides owe a total of $333,485 in back taxes – media silent,"" from a blog named ""Fire Andrea Mitchell."" 
The media was not silent, actually. The Associated Press had the story on March 8. 
These and other blog entries appear to build on a partial theme from a March 11 piece in Investor’s Daily Business and its website, Investors.com, by columnist Andrew Malcolm. 
Malcolm wrote, ""This is the third straight year that the chief executive of the United States has been unable to get his own staff members to keep up with a citizen's legal income tax obligations. to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars in back taxes owed. All this while Obama has made such rhetorical hay about corporations and the wealthy paying their fair share."" 
This was not the third straight year, however, unless you were measuring only one president, namely, Obama (2011 was his third year in office). These delinquencies have occurred every year, not just the last three, with some departments and administrations doing better than others. 
We know this because there have been other media reports in some of those years. But we also know because we requested multiple years worth of data from the IRS, and a spokeswoman provided us with the spreadsheets for every year dating to 2004. 
In 2008, the last year of George W. Bush’s presidency, 50 employees of the Executive Office of the President owed $812,917, according to reporting in 2009 by Bell, WTOP Radio in Washington and others. That put the executive office default rate at 2.93 percent, slightly higher than the current rate. 
The previous year, 2007, had an Executive Office of the President delinquency rate of 2.21 percent, according to a 2008 Washington Post report that highlighted a number of other departments and Congress, too. That’s confirmed in the data the IRS gave us. The lowest rate for the president’s staff during all these years was 2010 (so this was Obama’s staff), when it was 2.01 percent, the IRS data show. But in dollar terms, that was also the year with the most money owed: $833,970. In other words, fewer people were delinquent, but they owed more. 
The lowest amount owed by the president’s staff during all these years was $188,304, in 2007 (Bush’s staff), with a delinquency rate of 2.21. Yet in three of Bush’s last five years in office, his Executive Office staff owed more than $627,000. 
Malcolm, an opinion columnist, at least mentioned other government departments, as did subsequent reports -- which were quite balanced -- on Fox News. The partisan blogs, however, did not. 
  
Putting all this together, the claim -- that 40 staffers in the Obama White House are tax delinquents -- is accurate. Yet when presented as an Obama White House phenomenon, it omits pertinent facts. It fails to mention that this is neither new nor unique to this president or this branch of government. 
  
Based on PolitiFact guidelines, when a claim is accurate but leaves out facts necessary to get the full picture, the Truth-O-Meter is to read ""Mostly True."" That is how we rate this claim:  Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973FA0C0>],/factchecks/2013/apr/03/blog-posting/bloggers-say-obama-aides-are-delinquent-their-taxe/

Ex-Sen. Fred Thompson says Obamcare could raise premiums enough to pay for a new Ford Explorer
","
As District Attorney Arthur Branch on Law & Order, former Sen. Fred Thompson was always ready with a wisecrack. In a recent Twitter post, the Tennessee Republican offered a pointed barb about President Barack Obama’s health care law: 
""Report: Obamacare could raise ins premiums by 200%. It's the ‘A-Ford-able Care Act’ -- your insurance costs as much as a new Explorer."" 
As we looked into whether Thompson’s comparison was accurate, we found a trail of facts twisted into a misleading narrative. Here’s how the tale was constructed, piece by piece. 
Why premiums will go up 
First, we should make clear that independent, credible experts do expect health insurance premiums to increase for many people once the mandates in the health care law take full effect, many of them in 2014. 
As we have written previously, the health care law is so complex that it's difficult to predict its ultimate impact on premiums. Some parts of the law should reduce premiums (subsidies for lower-income Americans and rebates from insurers that charge too much for overhead) while other parts should increase premiums (a longer list of mandatory benefits). The overall impact will likely vary depending on your income and what type of insurance you buy. 
Take special note of the ""type of insurance"" -- it proves to be crucial in analyzing Thompson’s claim. 
There are three types of private-market insurance. Large-group plans supply coverage through an employer with more than 50 employees. Small group plans work the same way, but with the company employing fewer than 50 people. (For both types of group plans, the employees typically pay a portion of their health care premiums, and the employer pays the rest.) The third type of private insurance is in the nongroup market -- policies that people buy on their own, paying the entire cost themselves. Large group plans account for roughly 70 percent of private policies, with small-group plans accounting for about 13 percent and the nongroup market accounting for about 17 percent. 
The health care law is expected to affect each of these three types of policies differently. In 2009, the Congressional Budget Office projected that by 2016, insurance premiums in the large-group market would either stay the same or drop by up to 3 percent, while the small-group market would see anywhere from a drop of 2 percent to an increase of 1 percent. The biggest rises would be felt in the nongroup market, where premiums were projected to rise by between 10 percent and 13 percent. 
There’s a logic to this pattern: Currently, nongroup policies typically offer high-deductible coverage with low premiums. But under Obama’s law, all plans must provide a fixed list of benefits such as preventive care, and adding these services will come with a pricetag. So it’s reasonable for Thompson to point out that for this portion of the private-insurance market -- accounting for about one in every six private policies, many of them issued for younger and relatively healthy Americans -- will take a financial hit from the law. 
The congressional Republicans’ report 
We failed in our efforts to reach Thompson, but the first clue to figuring out his math is to look at the first part of his tweet: ""Report: Obamacare could raise ins premiums by 200%."" 
We read the report, which was released in March 2013 by the Republican staffs of three congressional committees. This report is hardly a neutral document, given that it was written by staffers of a party that has worked to repeal the health care law since it was passed in 2010. Still, Thompson’s tweet goes much further than the report does, and it ignores some important qualifiers. 
The Republican staff report says that ""some estimates show some Americans facing startling premium increases of 203 percent because of the law."" 
Let’s parse this statement. First, ""some estimates"" refers to a January 2013 study done by former CBO director Douglas Holtz-Eakin, who served as chief economist for the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush and as a top policy adviser to the presidential campaign of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. His survey asked a range of companies to share premium quotes for individuals with specific demographic characteristics in five cities, before and after the health care law took effect. 
In Holtz-Eakin’s study, the numbers around 200 percent refer to ""young adults in the individual market"" for certain cities. For instance, in Chicago, a young adult in the individual market before Obamacare would pay a premium of $756, rising to $2,268 after the law -- an increase of 202 percent. In Milwaukee, a pre-Obamacare premium of $696 would rise to $2,100, a jump of 203 percent. In three other cities listed, the increases ranged from 179 percent to 183 percent. 
Looking at these figures in isolation amounts to cherry-picking. To its credit, the Republican staff report made an effort to put this number into context by listing smaller projected increases as well. For instance, when the report lists projected increases in the 50 states for all people with individual insurance -- not just ""young adults"" -- these premium increases range from 30 percent to 100 percent. And the Republican report cites two studies that support figures on the low end of that spectrum: The Republican report cites a study by actuarial firm Oliver Wyman that suggests increases of 40 percent in the nongroup market, while the Society of Actuaries suggests a rise of 32 percent. 
These are still large increases, but they are nowhere near the eye-popping 200 percent figure that landed in headlines on conservative news sites and blogs. 
And there’s an additional level of cherry picking going on as well. The Republican report looks only at the nongroup market, which, as we noted, accounts for just 17 percent of the private-insurance market. The report says nothing about the large-group and small-group markets. 
This is not to say there won’t be financial hardship among young, healthy people with health insurance; there will be, and probably among other groups of Americans as well. But Thompson ignored the nuances when he tweeted that ""your insurance"" could rise by 200 percent. That kind of increase would only affect a vanishingly small proportion of Americans (or Thompson’s 139,000 Twitter followers). 
The cost of a Ford Explorer 
Some may suggest that Thompson was being facetious with his comparison, but we concluded that it's a checkable claim. And this is the part of the tweet where Thompson really goes off the rails. 
According to NADAguides.com, an online auto pricing service, the manufacturer’s suggested retail price for a four-wheel drive, four-door 2013 Ford Explorer ranges from $31,995 (for the basic model) to $41,675 (for the ""sport"" trim). For simplicity, we’ll choose the basic model. Is there any way that health premiums will zoom past $30,000 a year as a result of Obamacare? 
We can’t find any. 
The people in Chicago who could be seeing a 200 percent increase in their health insurances are currently paying annual premiums of $756. After the law hits, according to Holtz-Eakin, their premiums would go up to $2,268 -- an amount well short of the $30,000 pricetag for a new Explorer. 
Perhaps Thompson looked at a different chart in the Republican report. This chart, titled ""Obamacare Impact on Young Adults in the Small Group Market,"" shows that in Milwaukee, the costs for health insurance premiums in the small-group market would rise from $28,488 before the law to $78,744 after the law. The latter amount would be enough to buy two nicely pimped up Explorers -- but it refers to the cost of premiums for a business that employs 20 people. (The Republican report’s table doesn’t explain that, but we confirmed it with Holtz-Eakin.) 
Our ruling 
Thompson’s tweet takes a few snippets and spins them into a misleading tale. 
By some estimates, premiums for certain Americans could go up by 200 percent -- but only for a very specific type of person, namely young, healthy people who have already bought insurance on the nongroup market and will continue to do so. Meanwhile, the people who could see that big an increase would end up paying $2,200 in premiums after the law, far less than the $30,000 an actual new Explorer costs. 
Thompson’s tweet illustrates what can happen when eye-catching statistics are cherry-picked and repeated without the proper context. We rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E0080>],/factchecks/2013/apr/03/fred-thompson/ex-sen-fred-thompson-says-obamcare-could-raise-pre/

Will Weatherford compares tuition costs with cellphone bills
","
Let’s talk tuition. 
College tuition increases are a no-go with Gov. Rick Scott, who wants to keep the cost of living low for families. House Speaker Will Weatherford, on the other hand, thinks Florida students are getting a great deal and can afford to pay a little more. 
Weatherford explained his views at a meeting of the Florida Board of Governors, which oversees state universities, on March 28, 2013. 
The board’s student member, Cortez Whatley, asked Weatherford why the House recommended a 6 percent tuition increase for state universities. 
Florida’s tuition is ""48th"" lowest in the country, Weatherford said. (Quick fact-check: It ranks 41st in 2013. Weatherford has since corrected himself.) 
""Let me put in perspective something for you that no one’s talking about that should be talked about in this debate,"" he said. ""The average student in Florida, what they actually pay out of pocket at our major universities, I believe all universities, is about the same amount of money as they spend on this."" 
He held up his iPhone. 
""We’re more than willing to negotiate with our friends in the Senate and the governor, but we think to just take tuition off the table and ignore the fact that we’re ranked so low, and ignore the fact that our students are spending more on cellphones to some extent than they are on tuition, is not right,"" he said. 
Students spend as much on tuition as their cellphone? We thought it didn’t sound right. 
We admit to being a little surprised by what we found. 
Tuition in Florida 
Florida’s average price for undergraduate tuition and fees at a public university is $6,069 in 2012-13, according to the Board of Governors. That’s up from an average of $5,531 in 2011-12. 
Tuition used to be even lower but public universities have been bumping up tuition to offset steep budget cuts. As a result, the price tag for tuition at a four-year public university in Florida jumped 67 percent over the past five years. Florida’s five-year percentage leap for tuition was one of the highest in the country, according to the College Board’s 2012 Trends in College Pricing report. 
Still, most in-state students don’t pay full price. Many receive scholarships, grants and other financial aid. Once you factor in ""gift aid"" such as Bright Futures and Pell grants, a student’s out-of-pocket expenses for tuition and fees comes down. 
Weatherford’s spokesman and the Board of Governors sent us system-wide averages for gift aid versus what students actually paid in tuition and fees for 2011-12. This is for an in-state undergraduate student taking 15 credit hours of courses each fall and spring semester. 
 
So the average financial gift amount per full-time, in-state undergraduate student for the school year is $4,646. The average amount of what a student actually paid out-of-pocket for tuition and fees is about $400. 
The out-of-pocket expense varies widely by family income. Students whose families earn below $60,000 -- and comprise about 44 percent of the university system -- don’t pay out-of-pocket for tuition on average because they receive more gift aid based on need. Many of the students in this income bracket are paying for college independently of their parents, said College Board policy analyst Kathleen Payea. 
Students whose families earn more receive fewer dollars in gift assistance and pay between $1,500 and $2,000. 
The amount a student shells out for tuition and fees also varies at each state university. The average student at Florida A&M and Florida Atlantic University, for example, does not pay out-of-pocket for tuition and fees, according to data from the Board of Governors. On the other end of the spectrum, a student at the University of Central Florida pays an average of $1,600. At the University of Florida, the average is $248. 
You might be wondering, that’s it? Keep in mind this analysis excludes other types of financial aid, such as loans, that students must pay back, as well as money their parents paid in through the Florida Prepaid college savings program. 
It’s worth noting the average student faces thousands more in expenses that go to the total cost of attending a university -- books, transportation, room and board. At the University of South Florida in Tampa, for example, the average 2012-13 cost of attendance for a full-time, in-state student not living with his or her parents was $20,390. For in-state commuter students, it’s about $16,000. 
Still, Weatherford was careful to specify tuition. 
Payea said Weatherford’s comparison about cellphone bills and tuition is awkward, as paying for higher education is a long-term investment unlike a monthly discretionary item like a phone. Still, his example may help defray fears about college costs. 
""Sticker prices appear to be high, but there are so many subsidies,"" she said. 
We’ll note that the state changed Bright Futures eligibility requirements, primarily higher test scores, to make the scholarships harder to get. A University of South Florida analysis determined the changes will most likely reduce the number of black and Hispanic freshmen getting the scholarship, according to the Tampa Bay Times. 
The price of cellphones 
Now we turn to the second part of our analysis: the cost of cellphones. About 86 percent of U.S. residents said they have one, according to the Pew Research Center. 
Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy directed us to a September 2012 Wall Street Journal story in support of his claim. If Weatherford’s point is cellphones are affordable (like two semesters of in-state tuition), the story’s headline does not reinforce it: ""Cellphones are eating the family budget."" 
The story describes how the increasing costs of cellphones force families to scrimp elsewhere. Costs are going up even more in the next few years as wireless providers figure out how to make data even faster and more accessible on new networks. 
The story cites Labor Department data showing annual household spending on phone services (not isolated to just cellphones) was $1,226 in 2011, up from $1,110 in 2007. 
An estimate from J.D. Power and Associates puts it even higher for this year, showing the average wireless bill reported by consumers to be $111 as of March 2013 (or $1,332 for the year). 
Those annual bill totals are more than the system-wide average for out-of-pocket costs for  tuition and fees (again, about $400). If you isolate cash-paying students, the total tuition bill actually exceeds a year’s worth of cellphone bills, but not dramatically so. 
Our ruling 
Weatherford defended his call for a tuition hike before the leaders of the state university system by saying students spend more on cellphones than ""what they actually pay out of pocket at our major universities"" for tuition. 
We found his point is accurate if you compare the average out-of-pocket cost for all schools against the average cellphone bill, but there are caveats. 
Remember, he’s just talking about tuition, not the many other costs involved with a student’s degree. 
For the cash-paying families that comprise a majority of the system, the comparison is a little off, with students paying more for tuition than the average cellphone. Others spend a lot less on tuition, or a lot more, depending on their university. More than one-third of Florida’s public university students receive enough merit- and need-based financial aid that they do not pay anything for tuition and fees. 
Weatherford’s claim is accurate but needs clarification. We rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809782E840>],/factchecks/2013/apr/03/will-weatherford/will-weatherford-compares-tuition-costs-cellphone-/

Kirk Watson says 29 Texas cities use carbon monoxide to euthanize dogs and cats

","
A lawmaker seeking to ban the killing of dogs and cats by carbon monoxide says the method is used in 29 animal shelters around Texas, according to a March 19, 2013, Austin American-Statesman news article. 
We wondered. 
The claim by Sen. Kirk Watson, D-Austin, was aired as a Senate committee sent Watson’s proposal, Senate Bill 360, to the Senate, which advanced the measure to the House about a week later. 
The proposal, like companion legislation by Rep. Eddie Lucio III, D-Brownsville, would remove a provision from state law permitting a person to euthanize a dog or cat in an animal shelter using compressed carbon monoxide. Other animals, including birds and reptiles, could still be killed by the method, but dogs and cats in shelters could only be killed by injection with sodium pentobarbital, which is considered more humane and less costly. 
The story said the list of shelters using carbon monoxide--none of them in Central Texas--was compiled by the Texas Humane Legislative Network, a nonprofit that lobbies on behalf of animal welfare, which Watson spokesman Steve Scheibal described as Watson’s source for statistics related to the proposal. 
In a ""fact sheet"" posted online, the network says it contacted the state’s 1,200-plus cities and found that 32 Texas animal shelters, including one in Greenville, ""continue to utilize the outdated and inhumane carbon monoxide method of euthanasia."" Separately, in a February 2013 blog post, the network’s vice president, Shelby Bobosky, said more than 30 Texas cities, including Sherman and Terrell, stopped using carbon monoxide euthanasia within the last five years. 
By email, one of the network’s lobbyists, Jack Erskine, sent us a chart, dated March 18, 2013, listing 31 cities as using carbon monoxide to euthanize animals: Beeville; Bovina; Bracketville; Cuero; Devine; Eagle Pass; El Campo; Freer; Ganado; George West; Grand Saline; Greenville; Hondo; Kenedy; Kermit; Kingsville; Lyford; Mathis; Odessa; Plainview; Portland; Raymondville; Refugio; Sabinal; Seminole; Sinton; Stinnett; Taft; Van Horn; Victoria; and Yoakum. The chart says that all but two of these results were confirmed by the group from Dec. 17, 2012, through March 4, 2013.

Practices vary, according to footnotes to the chart quoting email responses from cities. Cuero responded that in 2011, 12 juvenile animals were euthanized by injection while 513 others were subjected to carbon monoxide. 
Bobosky pointed out that a state rule already bars carbon monoxide from being used to euthanize any animal ""reasonably presumed to be less than 16 weeks of age"" or for ""any animal that could be anticipated to have decreased respiratory function, such as the elderly, sick, injured or pregnant."" 
The rule continues: ""Such animals may be resistant to the effects of carbon monoxide and the time required to achieve death in these animals may be significantly increased. In animals with decreased respiratory function, carbon monoxide levels rise slowly, making it more likely that these animals will experience elevated levels of stress."" 
According to another footnote to the network’s chart, El Campo said it would start using injection on a trial basis in 2013. Meantime, Freer reported that its shelter had been demolished and no one was currently trained to euthanize animals, while Ganado said its shelter had been shut down and gave no indication if gas would be used in a shelter under construction, according to a footnote. 
Bobosky said by email that the number of shelters using carbon monoxide has dropped to 29 because Ganado and Freer no longer do so. 
More broadly, Bobosky said by phone, she and other network volunteers established the list by making public information requests of more than 1,100 Texas cities and towns, starting in November 2011, and asking if jurisdictions had animal shelters using gas to kill dogs and cats. If so, she said, they asked how many animals had been killed by the method in 2011. Bobosky said around 150 cities failed to respond; follow-up interviews indicated none of these cities had shelters. 
Bobosky said the number of shelters saying they use gas to euthanize has gone down since the network initially inquired in 2011, when the tally was 38 to 40. (She emailed us a network list of cities that do not use gas, among them San Marcos, Seguin and Taylor.) For instance, she said, Sherman ordered its last gas cylinder, which ultimately went unused, in March 2012. ""There is a trend in the last two years to simply stop using gas,"" she said. ""It’s outdated."" 
Finally, we spot-checked whether three bigger cities on the list referenced by Watson use carbon monoxide to euthanize dogs and cats. 
By phone, Sgt. Sherrie Carruth of the Odessa Police Department and Hector Chavez, an Eagle Pass official, separately said their local animal shelters use ""compressed carbon monoxide."" 
Joe Lopez, Victoria’s chief animal control officer, told us its shelter uses carbon monoxide to euthanize some dogs and cats, but depends on injections of a sodium pentobarbital solution for puppies, kittens and especially old or sickly cats and dogs. 
A twist: While not on the network’s list of carbon monoxide users, Maverick County offered a departure from the common practices. Apolonio Rodriguez, the county's road and bridges supervisor, said that about a year ago, the county stopped taking county-collected dogs and cats to the Eagle Pass city shelter to be euthanized, instead ""using the rifle"" to kill such animals. 
Bobosky, informed of our spot-checks, said the law that Watson seeks to amend already limits residents from euthanizing cats or dogs except by using commercially compressed carbon monoxide or sodium pentobarbital, meaning rifles should not be used. 
Our ruling 
Watson said 29 cities use carbon monoxide to euthanize dogs and cats. 
That’s supported by an advocacy group’s survey research, it appears, though the total also has gone down by more than 10 cities since 2011, according to the group.

Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner says 75 percent of closed air traffic towers are in Republican districts
","
Dozens of small airports around the country were touched by federal budget cuts under a decision announced March 22, 2013, by the Federal Aviation Administration. 
A total of 149 air traffic control towers operated by private contractors will be shut down, the agency decided. The decision was one of the most high profile and broad based actions to come under the politically charged sequestration cuts. 
Eight Wisconsin airports are on the list, including Crites Field in Waukesha, which lies in the district of U.S. Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (R-Menomonee Falls). 
Sensenbrenner issued a news release March 22, 2013, criticizing the FAA decision, saying the ""contract towers"" save money and have fewer safety problems. He also noted that the FAA’s budget was being cut 5 percent, but the spending for the contract towers was dropping 75 percent. 
Sensenbrenner added: ""Not coincidentally, 75 percent of the towers the Obama Administration is closing are located in Republican Congressional Districts."" 
Critics have said the administration is playing politics with the budget cuts. But Sensenbrenner’s claim was one of the first we’ve seen that quantified this complaint. 
Are 75 percent in GOP districts? 
We asked the congressman’s office for evidence to support his claim. That’s when we started to feel some turbulence. 
""That information came from a member of the aviation subcommittee,"" responded Sensenbrenner spokesman Ben Miller in an email. We asked him to be more precise about the source of the claim and the actual number. 
Three days after our initial inquiry, Miller responded: ""We have reissued the press release noting the correction. I appreciate you pointing it out."" 
Wait a minute. 
We didn’t offer a correction. We only asked a question. 
The reissued news release carried the notation ""updated,"" and this information: ""(A statistic in the previous release was unverifiable)."" 
Miller elaborated in an email: ""We received (the statistic) from the office of a member on the Aviation subcommittee and are unwilling to throw anyone under the bus. We couldn’t verify the statistic we received and therefore issued a retraction. Unfortunately, Rep. Sensenbrenner is unavailable for an interview today."" 
Still curious on the number, we started searching, emailing and mapping. 
Sensenbrenner’s claim was repeated in several news accounts of his reaction to the budget cuts, including on Fox News and in the Janesville Gazette. (Milwaukee Journal Sentinel coverage did not include the claim.) 
We did come across a similar claim from another House member, U.S. Rep. Joe Pitts (R-Penn.). 
""Two out of every three towers slated for closure are in Republican Congressional districts,"" Pitts said in a March 7, 2013 news release. ""Unfortunately, this political game has real implications for public safety."" 
The statement by Pitts, who is not a member of the aviation subcommittee, came before the FAA announced its final tower closing list. At the time, there was a preliminary list of 189 airports. 
Pitts, whose district includes one of the airports, did some analysis of that preliminary list, said spokesman Andrew Wimer. 
""We had some of our interns here look up some of the ZIP codes,"" of the affected towers and then cross referenced that information with congressional districts, Wimer said. The result: Just under 66 percent were in Republican districts, Wimer said. 
Wimer declined to release the data, and he would not say what the survey results say about the final closing list. 
So we’re on our own to test Sensenbrenner’s claim. We plotted the 149 towers set for closure on a map. And then we cross referenced by party with congressional districts. 
Of the 149 airports slated for closure, four fall inside two separate congressional districts. Of those four, two sit in two Republican districts while the other two straddle a Republican and a Democratic district.  
The overall breakdown of the House is 234 Republicans to 201 Democrats, which means Republicans have about 54 percent of the seats. 
There is another factor at play: Many of the affected airports are in less-populated rural areas that tend to lean Republican. 
Let’s land this item. 
Arguing politics were involved in the FAA’s tower closing decision, Sensenbrenner said 75 percent of the towers set to close were in Republican districts. 
Three days after we asked about it, Sensenbrenner removed the claim and, in at least in one version of the statement, included a note saying a previous version relied on ""unverifiable"" information. It would have been more accurate to say that the statement was unverified. 
We verified the numbers. And we rate the statement False.

"['Georgia', 'Elections', 'Supreme Court', 'John Lewis']","
Costs associated with Voting Rights Act can vary by case
","
A Supreme Court decision on a key provision of the 1965 Voting Rights Act could come in June. 
The court heard arguments in late February on Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires Georgia and eight other states with a history of discrimination -- Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Texas and Virginia -- to get permission, or ""preclearance,"" from the federal government before implementing any changes affecting elections. The provision is being challenged by Shelby County, Ala., and also applies to parts of seven other states. 
Opponents of the provision, including Georgia Attorney General Sam Olens, say the blatant racial intimidation and discrimination that existed in voting processes decades ago no longer exist. They also say the formula used to determine which states are covered under the statute is outdated because it is based on voter turnout and registration data from 1972. They also cite the high cost for adhering to Section 5 requirements when states or jurisdictions want to make changes to their elections processes. Georgia was one of several states that filed a ""friend of the court"" brief supporting Shelby County’s suit. The Justice Department has rejected election changes in Georgia nearly 180 times under the Section 5 provision. 
Throughout the challenge, U.S. Rep. John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia and a civil rights pioneer, has been a crusader for keeping Section 5, and he made his case in an opinion column for The Washington Post a few days before the court arguments. 
""Opponents of Section 5 complain of state expense, yet their only cost is the paper, postage and manpower required to send copies of legislation to the federal government for reviews, hardly a punishment,"" Lewis wrote. 
But what about court costs and attorneys’ fees? Did states not have these expenses, too? We wondered whether Lewis’ low-cost compliance analysis was correct. 
After years of efforts, particularly in Southern states, to prevent blacks from voting, voting rights battles reached a peak in 1965. Early that year, Lewis and other voting rights marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Ala., on their way to Montgomery, the state capital, were attacked by state troopers. That attack, along with other violent incidents in the South against blacks and activists, persuaded President Lyndon Johnson to push for a strong voting rights law that eventually became the Voting Rights Act. 
Section 5 of the act, including the preclearance review requirement for specific jurisdictions seeking elections changes, was extended in 1970, 1975, 1982 and for 25 years in 2006. The Voting Section of the Department of Justice reviews 15,000 to 24,000 voting changes each year, and receives between 4,500 and 5,500 Section 5 submissions. 
Jurisdictions seeking a preclearance review have two options under Section 5: a declaratory judgment process and an administrative review process. 
The declaratory judgment process is a court-intensive process that involves the jurisdiction’s filing a motion with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. A three-judge panel hears the request. Any appeals go directly to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
The administrative review process is designed to be an expeditious, cost-effective alternative. It involves jurisdictions’ submitting proposed voting changes to the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice for review. If the attorney general doesn’t object to the change, or if no objection is filed within 60 days, then the jurisdiction can implement the change. The DOJ provides a list of documents and information jurisdictions must submit for the administrative review, including a reason for the change, the date the change would take effect and contact information for the agency in charge of enforcing the election change. The DOJ reports that more than 99 percent of the changes affecting voting are reviewed administratively. 
Administrative review documents can be filed by mail and online. 
States choosing the declaratory judgment process first, or after a voting change was denied in the administrative process, can accrue large legal bills. For example, South Carolina spent $3.5 million last year challenging a DOJ rejection of its proposed voter ID law. After taking the case to court, the three-judge declaratory judgment panel ruled in January in the state’s favor and precleared the law for 2013. The federal government was ordered to pay $54,000 of the state’s costs. Texas also appealed a rejection of a redistricting plan. That appeal before the Supreme Court is likely on hold until the Shelby County case is decided. 
But several states covered in whole or part by Section 5 -- California, Mississippi, New York, and North Carolina -- support its constitutionality, and in an amicus brief they filed in the Shelby County case, they wrote that ""its compliance burdens are minimal.""   
Lewis’ office points out that the litigation costs associated with the declaratory judgment process are optional, unless a jurisdiction wants to challenge that decision through a lawsuit. 
Lewis’ assessment of the compliance costs is fair, said Myrna Perez, deputy director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning think tank/advocacy group. Perez has reviewed several elections changes filed by different states. 
But Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia who has done studies on the impact of the Voting Rights Act in Georgia, said the administrative review route may be simple and inexpensive for trivial changes, such as moving a polling place from a fire station to a school. With more complex changes, such as redistricting plans, though, even the administrative review route can be complicated and carry indirect costs, he said. 
Georgia spent hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees for outside attorneys -- not including work done by internal office staff -- for a federal judicial review of the state’s redistricting plan in 2001. In March 2002, the state Legislature passed a midyear budget that included $1.8 million for legal fees to defend the plan. 
""You will have to provide the alternative plans that were considered and rejected, votes on those plans,"" Bullock said. ""I have no idea of the costs, but there is a fair amount of manpower to do this."" And that manpower has a cost, he said. 
So does Lewis’ claim balance the scales of justice? 
Lewis said that opponents of Section  5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires certain jurisdictions to obtain preclearance from the federal government to implement elections changes, are wrong when they say adhering to the requirements can be expensive. Lewis says the cost is minimal, with states only having to fund the paper, postage and manpower required for submitting the required documents. 
For administrative reviews on minor issues, Lewis appears to be correct. The Justice Department provides an administrative process for preclearence submissions that is designed to cut litigation costs. And most of the states choose this option. But that option can be expensive. And there is also another more costly option for states that involves taking the case through the court system, which is likely to require significant amounts of money in legal fees. 
Lewis’ claim is partially accurate but leaves out important details about the second review method’s cost for more complex elections changes. For this missing information, we rated his claim Half True.

Rhode Island Catholic Bishop Tobin says U.S. Supreme Court decisions on same-sex marriage could nullify any Rhode Island votes on the issue
","
With two same-sex marriage cases before the U.S. Supreme Court and two competing bills that would legalize same-sex marriage now before the Rhode Island Senate Judiciary Committee, Roman Catholic Bishop Thomas Tobin issued a statement March 27 urging state legislators to delay any action. 
Tobin, who leads the Diocese of Providence, has strongly opposed same-sex marriage. 
""In light of the historic deliberations of the U.S. Supreme Court on same-sex marriage, it would be appropriate for the General Assembly of Rhode Island to defer any action on this critical issue for the time being,"" Tobin said. ""Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June. It is likely that the Supreme Court will decide this matter for us, one way or another. Let's wait to see what the highest court of the land says about this issue which is so very important to many Rhode Islanders."" 
We were interested in Tobin’s assertion that any legislative action that is taken now by the General Assembly might become ""completely null and void"" after the Supreme Court's ruling on its two cases. 
We asked Tobin’s office for an explanation. His spokesman said the bishop was out of town and unavailable. 
So we started making inquiries. 
The first Rhode Island proposal would, as a matter of law, replace the civil same-sex unions already legal in Rhode Island with same-sex marriage. That proposal has already passed the Rhode Island House. 
The second, if approved by the General Assembly and signed by the governor, would call for a referendum on whether to enshrine same-sex marriage into the Rhode Island Constitution, a document that doesn't mention marriage at all. 
Supporters of same-sex marriage oppose this bill, in part, because it includes protections for businesses that would refuse, on religious grounds, to provide goods and services for same-sex ceremonies. 
We asked legal experts on both sides of the debate whether any action by the U.S. Supreme Court in the two cases it is considering could nullify action by the Rhode Island legislature. All said that passage of either Rhode Island bill would not be affected by a Supreme Court ruling. 
That's because neither bill is proposing to make same-sex marriage illegal. The Supreme Court, in contrast, is weighing the constitutionality of bans on same-sex marriages, said Jesse Choper, professor of public law at the University of California Berkeley School of Law. 
In the case heard March 26, the issue was whether a successful voter initiative passed in California, known as Proposition 8, can lawfully ban same-sex marriages in that state. 
In the case heard the next day, the issue was whether the federal Defense of Marriage Act, commonly called DOMA, is discriminatory because, like the California law, it  restricts the definition of marriage to a union between one man and one woman. DOMA denies federal benefits to same-sex couples. 
""There is absolutely no chance that the Supreme Court will nullify a Rhode Island law adopting same-sex marriage, either by referendum or by action of the General Assembly,"" said Jared Goldstein, professor of law at Roger Williams University School of Law. 
""The issue in the two cases before the Supreme Court this term is whether laws against same-sex marriage violate the Constitution's guarantee of equal protection, not whether laws allowing same-sex marriage violate the Constitution,"" he said in an e-mail. 
David S. Cohen, a constitutional law and gender issues expert at Drexel University in Philadelphia, agreed: ""Rhode Island still has every reason to go forward if they want marriage equality,"" he said. 
  
If the Supreme Court were to broadly rule in the Proposition 8 case that it is unconstitutional to deny same-sex couples the right to marry -- a ruling most of our experts said seems unlikely given comments made by the justices during oral arguments -- that ""would legalize same-sex marriage in every state across the country no matter what the state is currently doing,"" Cohen said. A ruling on DOMA would only apply to federal law. 
Even if DOMA and the California proposition are upheld, ""It doesn't preclude [Rhode Island] from recognizing same-sex marriage either way,"" said Emily Sack, also a professor at Roger Williams. 
In theory, if the Supreme Court were to require every state to accept same-sex marriage, that would make the proposed referendum on the Rhode Island Constitution a meaningless ballot question. 
""If the court rules that Prop 8 is invalid because same-sex couples have a constitutional right to marry in every state, the ruling would effectively block a state referendum on the subject because we don't put constitutional rights to a vote,"" said Goldstein. But ""a decision granting same-sex marriage is under no threat of Supreme Court nullification, and the only realistic threat of nullification is if Rhode Island keeps the law as it is."" 
  
Our ruling 
Bishop Thomas Tobin urged the General Assembly to delay consideration of any same-sex marriage legislation in Rhode Island because, ""Any legislative action that is taken now could very well be rendered completely null and void by the decision of the Supreme Court expected this June."" 
But the question of whether to allow same-sex marriage -- the topic of the bills being considered by the state legislature -- is not what the U.S. Supreme Court is considering. The court is looking at the constitutionality of laws intent on blocking same-sex marriage. 
That's a key difference. 
As a result, except for an unexpected decision by the court to allow same-sex marriage nationwide, approval of either General Assembly bill is not going to be affected by what the justices decide in June. 
We rule Tobin's statement False.

ProgressOhio says Ohio lacks a law prohibiting employment and housing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation
","
The U.S. Supreme Court put the focus on same-sex marriage when it heard cases challenging California's Proposition 8 and the federal Defense of Marriage Act, but attention elsewhere fell on a wider range of rights issues. 
The liberal advocacy group ProgressOhio Education used the opportunity to send out a fundraising email highlighting its work ""for the rights of all Ohioans"" beyond marriage. 
""Did you know,"" the email asked, ""it is legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant just for being gay?"" 
The assertion took PolitiFact Ohio by surprise. We asked ProgressOhio for more information. 
Executive director Brian Rothenberg said the failure of state legislation prohibiting employment and housing discrimination left gay people without legal protection in those areas. 
He pointed to a recent legal case as underlining that point. 
The legislation he mentioned was the Equal Housing and Employment Act, House Bill 176, which would have added sexual orientation and gender identity to the list of classifications for which it is illegal to discriminate for housing, employment and public-accommodation purposes in Ohio. 
(It already is illegal in Ohio to discriminate against a person on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, handicap, age and ancestry.) 
Introduced in the 128th General Assembly, H.B. 176 was passed by the Ohio House in September 2009, but was never brought up for a vote in the Senate and died with the end of that legislative session. 
Similar legislation, House Bill 335, was introduced in the 129th General Assembly in October 2011. It suffered a similar fate, dying without a vote in either chamber. 
The legal case Rothenberg cited, Inskeep v. Western Reserve Transit Authority, was decided in March by Ohio's 7th District Court of Appeals. The court dismissed the suit of a man who claimed he was harassed on the job because of his sexual orientation, ruling that Ohio's employment discrimination statute does not protect ""sexual orientation."" 
The court said in its decision: ""Several states have chosen to enact legislation prohibiting discrimination against homosexuals by adding sexual orientation as a protected status in their discrimination statutes. Because Ohio has not, it has been concluded that sexual orientation is not protected."" 
We looked further and found that Ohio prohibited discrimination within state employment based on sexual orientation and gender identity under an executive order issued by then-Gov. Ted Strickland in 2007. After it expired, Gov. John Kasich issued an executive order in January 2011 prohibiting discrimination based on sexual orientation, but not gender identity. Both orders applied only to public employees in state jobs. 
Twenty-nine Ohio cities and counties now have anti-discrimination ordinances, according to a tally by the state chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
Ohio’s lack of protections against discrimination based on sexual orientation parallels both federal law and the law of 28 other states, according to Business Management Daily, the advocacy group Equality Ohio and the ACLU. 
On the Truth-O-Meter, the statement that it is legal in Ohio to fire an employee or evict a tenant for being gay rates as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D27700>],/factchecks/2013/apr/02/progressohio/progressohio-says-ohio-lacks-law-prohibiting-emplo/

Mark Kelly says 94 percent of Floridians support universal background checks
","
Former astronaut Mark Kelly, the husband of Arizona shooting victim Gabby Giffords, said that while ""gun control"" doesn’t poll very well, there’s ""incredible momentum"" to pass a universal background check law. 
Never mind five Republican senators, including Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., who say that they’re going to filibuster any new ""Second Amendment restrictions."" 
""I would say to Marco Rubio that 94 percent of his constituents support a universal background check,"" Kelly told Fox News Sunday host Chris Wallace on March 31, 2013. 
National polls this year show strong support for universal background checks, from Pew Research Center’s 85 percent to Quinnipiac University’s 92 percent. 
We wondered, is it true that 94 percent of Floridians —who share their state with NRA superlobbyist Marion Hammer and a Stand Your Ground law — favor universal background checks? 
The polls 
We reached out to Kelly and Gifford’s advocacy group, Americans for Responsible Solutions, but didn’t immediately hear back. 
Still, we quickly found a poll supporting Kelly’s ""94 percent"" figure. 
It came from a group co-chaired by New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, Mayors Against Illegal Guns. The February survey of 600 voters was conducted by the polling firm of Democratic consultant Doug Schoen. 
We wouldn’t call that an independent survey. 
However, Quinnipiac University conducted state surveys in March. And its poll of 1,000 registered voters found 91 percent support for universal background checks. 
The question: ""Do you favor or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" 
That also supports Kelly’s ""94 percent"" claim — within the Quinnipiac poll’s 3.1 percentage point margin of error. 
It’s also decent evidence that Floridians are in line with the country on expanding background checks from just sales by federally licensed dealers to sales between private sellers, sometimes referred to as closing the ""gun show loophole"" or ""private seller loophole."" 
Even among Florida Republicans, the Quinnipiac poll showed 87 percent support. 
Rubio hasn’t been so clear. 
In January, he gave an interview that made it sound like he was open to universal checks. (""I think you'll find support for that so long as there's not a public database that people can look up and see who owns what guns and where they live."") 
Then his spokesman clarified he wasn’t. (""Expanding it to private sales is problematic because you are asking an individual to conduct a background check on another individual. That is expensive and hard to do, and he does not support that."") 
His most recent statement doesn’t endorse background checks and opposes ""new Second Amendment restrictions."" 
Our ruling 
Kelly said ""94 percent of (Rubio's) constituents support a universal background check."" A major state poll conducted in March shows 91 percent of Florida voters favor requiring checks ""for all gun buyers."" Kelly’s claim is within the poll’s margin of error. We rate his statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C255A80>],/factchecks/2013/apr/02/mark-kelly/mark-kelly-says-94-percent-floridians-support-univ/
"['Education', 'Texas', 'Matt Mackowiak']","
Matt Mackowiak says UT president has raised four-year graduation rate to 75 percent
","
Analyzing flashpoints of debate concerning the flagship University of Texas, Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak credited UT’s president with greatly driving up student graduation rates. 
Bill Powers, who has faced public questioning from members of the UT System Board of Regents, ""has instituted reforms on his own,"" Mackowiak wrote in an opinion column published by the Austin American-Statesman on April 1, 2013. He added that UT System Chancellor Francisco Cigarroa had recently said Powers raised UT-Austin’s ""four-year graduation rate from 53 percent to 75 percent."" 
  
We were unaware of such a spike since Powers took over as president in 2006. 
After emailing Mackowiak about his conclusion, we turned to news stories on campus graduation rates as well as research cupboarded by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. 
According to a June 7, 2012, American-Statesman article, Powers set a goal in 2011 of at least 70 percent of the fall 2012 entering class earning a degree within four years. In contrast, UT's graduation rate had lately ranged from about 46 percent in 2000 to nearly 53 percent in 2005, the story said, with the 51 percent rate for the class of 2011 proving to be the highest among the state's 38 public universities for that year. 
  
A Feb. 12, 2013, Statesman news story said UT efforts to meet the goal ""include stepped-up freshman orientation to reshape a campus culture that has long tolerated a more leisurely trajectory to graduation; the appointment of a senior vice provost to champion the four-year graduation cause; and the allotment of $5 million to encourage students to finish on time, with some of that money earmarked for financial aid to those making steady academic progress."" 
Next, we asked the coordinating board for its calculation of UT-Austin’s four-year graduation rates. Spokesman Dominic Chavez emailed us a spreadsheet indicating the rate has ranged from 52 percent in fiscal 2007, which began Sept. 1, 2006, about seven months into Powers’ tenure, to 53 percent in fiscal 2012, the year ending Aug. 31, 2012. 
Chavez said each board calculation reflects the share of full-time students who enrolled in the fall of the year four years before, meaning the 2012 rate would sweep in students who had first enrolled in fall 2008 and graduated by the end of August 2012. Chavez said the reported rates may differ from other calculations because the board credits an institution where a student began his education even if the student has transferred and ultimately graduated elsewhere. 
We also asked UT-Austin about its four-year graduation rates. Spokesman Gary Susswein emailed a spreadsheet indicating the four-year rate has improved from 51 to 52 percent through Powers’ presidency. 
As we gathered this information, Mackowiak said by email that he picked up the graduation statistic from remarks by Cigarroa during a public interview by the Texas Tribune. In the March 28, 2013, interview, Cigarroa credited Powers for saying ""we will increase the four-year graduation rate from 53 percent to 75 percent. And he put his neck out on the line and he’s going to do it."" 
On review, Mackowiak said, it’s clear the escalated four-year graduation rate is a goal. ""It’s my mistake,"" he wrote. At Mackowiak's nudge, the American-Statesman published a correction of his column. 
Our ruling 
Mackowiak said UT-Austin’s president had driven four-year graduation rates to 75 percent. 
However, the latest four-year graduation rate on the campus was no greater than 53 percent, compared to rates the same or a bit lower in the other full years of Powers’ presidency. The institution's declared goal is a four-year rate of at least 70 percent. 
  
We rate the claim as False.

This did not affect our rating of his claim.",[<zip object at 0x00000280972D7C00>],/factchecks/2013/apr/02/matt-mackowiak/matt-mackowiak-says-ut-president-has-raised-four-y/

Will Weatherford says 1,000 people a day move to Florida because of freedom
","
Americans are relocating to Florida in droves, House Speaker Will Weatherford told a group of liberty-loving activists at the Capitol. 
Why? Freedom! It’s a quantity in short supply in those tax-loving states up north. 
""You may not know this, but today almost 1,000 people a day are moving to the state of Florida,"" he said at a rally by Americans for Prosperity Florida on March 19, 2013. ""Do you know why they're coming here? Because they are more free here than they are in some other states."" 
We checked out Weatherford’s number for new Floridians and why they’re coming here. Grab your U-Haul and come along for the ride. 
Population estimates 
Weatherford spokesman Ryan Duffy sent us a March 2013 Sarasota Herald-Tribune article about Florida’s booming population growth. ""Fueled by job seekers, foreign immigrants and baby boomer retirees,"" Florida will soon surpass New York in population, the article states. 
Duffy honed in on one line: ""Moody's is among those predicting Florida's population will swell by 360,000 this year."" Weatherford divided 360,000 by 365, which comes out to 986.3 (or ""almost 1,000 people a day""). 
Chris Lafakis, the Moody’s Analytics senior economist behind the projection, told us his figure is based on net migration, which is the number of people moving in minus those moving out, plus the number of births minus deaths. It includes people who move here from other countries, not just other states. 
Mekael Teshome, a PNC Financial Services Group economist, told us the Moody’s projection is on the high side, and his estimate for population growth in 2013 is in the upper 200,000s. 
Weatherford is not the only politician touting the number of people moving into the state. Gov. Rick Scott said on CNN and in other interviews that 230,000 people moved to Florida in 2012, referencing census numbers. 
We should note that people have been moving to Florida since the state was founded. In the 1980s, when Democrats controlled most every branch of state government, about 875 people on average moved to Florida every day, according to census figures. In the 1970s -- while Democrats were in control -- an average of 810 people moved to Florida every day. In the 2000s, during the economic crisis and under Republican control, an average of around 772 people moved to Florida every day. 
Why Florida? 
We thought of a few ways to interpret Weatherford’s claim that people are moving to Florida because of freedom. Cubans who arrive on Miami-Dade shores? Fair to say they are moving here for freedom. New York retirees trading in their down coats for swim suits? We’re not sure they’d say freedom (unless they mean freedom from snow). 
Asked to clarify Weatherford’s remarks, his spokesman sent us materials indicating he meant economic freedom. He directed us to a study by the business-backed Tax Foundation that showed Florida ranked No. 27 of states with the highest tax burdens. New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and California topped the list. 
Does this really explain our population boom? Economists typically don’t factor in value judgments, Teshome said. But they still have an idea of what brings people to, ahem, the Sunshine State. 
""Florida’s great weather and abundant white-collar job opportunities are what primarily attract individuals,"" Lafakis said, ""but the lack of a personal income tax and a pretty friendly business climate certainly help."" 
The population uptick is picking up as the result of an improving national economy that enables out-of-staters to sell their houses and buy new ones in Florida, Teshome said. 
The University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research conducts a random monthly telephone survey of state residents. For respondents who say they have moved to Florida, be it one year ago or many, researchers ask about their primary reason for the move. 
From January 2012 to February 2013, the top results were family/marriage (29 percent), job (22 percent) and climate/weather (18.9 percent). The ""other"" category, which includes reasons such as retirement, and makes up 14.6 percent of results. 
Jobs are the main reason people relocate to Florida in their 20s, 30s and 40s, said Stan Smith, professor of economics and director of the Population Program in the Bureau of Economic and Business Research (BEBR) at the University of Florida. For those in their 50s and 60s, climate is the No. 1 reason. Family reasons are a factor in basically each age group, he said. 
""Freedom"" itself is not a category, though 2.1 percent said they moved for the low cost of living and 1 percent said political reasons. 
Florida’s cost of living used to be substantially lower than the rest of the states 30 or 40 years ago, but the state moved to the middle of the pack in recent years, Smith said. And even though Florida does not have a state income tax, residents pay more for home insurance, prices for which soared after the 2004 and 2005 hurricane seasons. 
Finally, the conservative Mercatus Center at George Mason University releases an annual report examining freedom in each state, using a comprehensive checklist that looks at measures such as taxes and government spending, the liability system, property rights and even throwing a bachelor party. Florida falls in the middle of the pack at No. 23. 
Florida ranks well above average for education and its fiscal policies, but the state lost standing for its debt burden and restrictions on civil liberties. The center recommended spending less on services such as police and fire protection, airports, parks, and sanitation and ending mandatory minimum sentences for victimless crimes. 
Our ruling 
Weatherford said almost 1,000 people a day are moving to Florida ""because they are more free here than they are in some other states."" 
The number is actually a projection of the 2013 net migration. In 2012, census data shows that about 630 people on average moved to Florida each day. 
Our problem, however, is more with his assertion of why people are migrating to Florida. There's no real evidence to suggest it's freedom -- as in the business and tax climate -- as Weatherford suggests. Survey data shows most people move here because of family, jobs and weather. 
And in fact, when you look at Florida history, the state has seen similar population growth under both Republicans and Democrats.
