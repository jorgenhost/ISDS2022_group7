More college graduates living at home than in decades
","Congratulations graduate! Now go clean your room, help make dinner for the family and do the laundry. More college graduates are living with their families than in decades, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said in his State of the State speech Monday in New York City. ""Student debt now surpasses credit card debt and consumer debt and more college graduates are living at home than in decades,"" Cuomo said. Cuomo’s comment came as part of his push to provide tuition-free public college to students from families earning $125,000 or less each year. Cuomo said graduates with less debt are more likely to afford living on their own. Is Cuomo right that more college graduates are living at home? Where the graduates live The Pew Research Center provided the latest analysis on this topic in May 2016. The center relied on data from the U.S. Census Bureau to track the percentage of young adults, ages 18 to 34, who moved back home after graduating college. Nineteen percent of graduates lived at home in 2014, according to the data. That’s compared with 46 percent of graduates who either lived with a spouse or partner. The remaining graduates lived alone, with roommates, or had a different living arrangement. The percentage of graduates living at home is the highest since the 1940s, when 29 percent of college-educated young adults lived at home, Pew said. By 1950, only 12 percent of graduates lived at home. That number hovered between 10 and 13 percent until 2006, when 15 percent of graduates lived at home. Since then, the latest data shows the percentage increasing. Census Bureau data shows the number of college graduates has increased each decade since 1940. That indicates the number of college graduates moving back home increased between decades even when the percentage stayed flat. Not just graduates The trend is the same for young adults who did not attend college. Thirty-six percent of those young adults were living at home in 2014, compared with 35 percent in 1940. That number dropped to 20 percent by 1960 but has increased since. About 32 percent of young adults lived at home in 2014 regardless of education level, up from 20 percent in 1960. That’s not an all-time high, but Pew noted that it is the first time in more than 130 years that young adults were more likely to be living at home than with a spouse or partner. About 36 percent of young adults were reported as living alone or in a different living arrangement, Pew said. Chris Tilly, an urban planning professor from the University of California Los Angeles, said the increase is caused by rising urban housing costs and a changing labor market. ""There’s just a much higher level of economic uncertainty,"" Tilly said. ""A lot of work is now precarious in a lot of ways. It’s part-time. It’s unsure. It’s stringing together a bunch of gigs."" Our ruling Cuomo said ""more college graduates are living at home than in decades."" Cuomo is right, according to a Pew Research Center analysis. The percentage of college graduates living with their parents is at its highest since the 1940s. We rate his claim as True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/3d61f9ab-6c46-427b-9672-49bbcff5c019",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CCBBC0>],/factchecks/2017/jan/09/andrew-cuomo/more-college-graduates-living-home-decades/

Mike Pence says under Obamacare, 'American families have seen an increase in premiums of $5,000'
","As part of his visit to Capitol Hill to kick off Republican efforts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, Vice President-elect Mike Pence blasted the law -- also known as Obamacare -- for its impact on ordinary Americans’ finances. ""Right now, the American people are laboring under extraordinary increases in premiums,"" Pence told reporters. ""The average deductible for a bronze policy (the least comprehensive Obamacare offering) today is $12,000. American families have seen an increase in premiums of $5,000. And this year, the average premium increase on families has been over 25 percent, and 100 percent in some American states. That all comes to an end when we set in motion an effort to repeal and replace Obamacare."" Pence was right that the premiums for policies purchased on the online marketplace HealthCare.gov were slated to be 25 percent higher in 2017 than 2016. When the Department of Health and Human Services announced that figure, it became a major talking point for Republicans like presidential candidate Donald Trump. But the part of Pence’s comment that raised our eyebrows was that under Obamacare, ""American families have seen an increase in premiums of $5,000."" As we discovered, that’s not really correct. (The Trump-Pence transition office did not respond to our inquiries.) How much did premiums rise for Obamacare policies? We started by looking at the data released by HHS about average Obamacare premiums. This data has been released for four years -- 2014 to 2017. We looked at one of the standard measurements the department calculates every year -- what a family of four with a household income of $60,000 would pay for premiums on the second-lowest-cost silver plan. (As you might guess, a silver plan is more comprehensive than a bronze plan, but less generous than gold and platinum plans.) Premiums for this type of policy started at $9,468 a year in 2014, rose very modestly to $9,636 in 2015, rose somewhat more aggressively to $10,428 in 2016, and then rather substantially -- 25 percent -- to $13,080 in 2017. Altogether, then, average premiums for this type of Obamacare plan rose by a cumulative 38 percent during that period, which is not a trivial amount. However, the raw dollar increase was less than what Pence said -- $3,612 rather than $5,000. So Pence’s dollar figure is exaggerated. That said, we’ll note a few additional bits of context, some helpful to Pence’s overall argument and some not. • Consumers won’t be paying all of this amount. This $3,612 figure doesn't take into account the subsidies that most marketplace purchasers qualify for. Once the average level of subsidies are included in the calculation, the actual out-of-pocket premium cost borne by qualifying consumers actually decreased slightly between 2014 and 2017 -- a drop of $60, from $4,920 in 2014 to $4,860 in 2017. That's an important piece of context that's missing from Pence’s comment. • Premiums on HealthCare.gov have risen faster than premiums for employer-sponsored plans. We looked at data calculated annually by the Kaiser Family Foundation and the Health Research and Educational Trust about employer-provided policies and their premiums. Between 2013 and 2016, premiums for the average full-family, employee-sponsored plan rose by a cumulative 11 percent. That’s well below the increase for Obamacare plans, which as we noted was 38 percent between 2014 and 2017. • Before Obamacare, under President George W. Bush, overall premium increases were faster. Before you assume that all premiums rose faster under Obama, consider this. According to the Kaiser/Health Research and Educational Trust studies, family premiums for employer-sponsored insurance increased by a cumulative 99 percent -- basically doubling -- under the eight years of Bush, while under eight years of Obama, they rose by a much more modest 59 percent. On this score, the news is not great for Pence. Our ruling Pence said that under Obamacare, ""American families have seen an increase in premiums of $5,000."" Judged in context, Pence appears to be talking only about people who buy their insurance from HealthCare.gov. And in reality, the increase for the most common yardstick plan from HealthCare.gov has been smaller than that -- $3,612. Over the same time period, federal subsidies actually decreased what the average marketplace purchaser had to pay. On the other hand, $3,612 is not a trivial increase, and it’s valid to note that the premiums rose significantly faster for these plans than they did for employer-sponsored insurance over an equivalent period. We rate Pence’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BDC3C0>],/factchecks/2017/jan/09/mike-pence/mike-pence-says-under-obamacare-american-families-/

Donald Trump's dubious claim that foreign governments had 'absolutely no effect' on election outcome
","On Jan. 6, President-elect Donald Trump was briefed on the U.S. intelligence community’s probe into allegations of Russian influence in the 2016 presidential election, including possible connections to electronic hacks and public releases of private communications by senior Democrats. A declassified version of the report found that ""Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered an influence campaign in 2016 aimed at the U.S. presidential election. Russia’s goals were to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process, denigrate (Trump’s opponent, Hillary) Clinton, and harm her electability and potential presidency."" Following the intelligence briefing, Trump’s office released a statement. After noting the ""constructive meeting"" and the ""tremendous respect"" he had for their work, Trump stated: While Russia, China, other countries, outside groups and people are consistently trying to break through the cyber infrastructure of our governmental institutions, businesses and organizations including the Democrat (sic) National Committee, there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election including the fact that there was no tampering whatsoever with voting machines. There were attempts to hack the Republican National Committee, but the RNC had strong hacking defenses and the hackers were unsuccessful. The phrase that caught our eye was, ""there was absolutely no effect on the outcome of the election."" That's a pretty definitive statement. And Trump echoed this argument in a Jan. 7 tweet: ""Intelligence stated very strongly there was absolutely no evidence that hacking affected the election results. Voting machines not touched!"" However, the argument that there was no impact of any kind on the election outcome is not backed up by the intelligence community’s report. The report specifically stated it didn’t look at that question. Here’s what the report actually said: We did not make an assessment of the impact that Russian activities had on the outcome of the 2016 election. The U.S. Intelligence Community is charged with monitoring and assessing the intentions, capabilities, and actions of foreign actors; it does not analyze U.S. political processes or U.S. public opinion. So if the Trump campaign is using the intelligence community report to back up its assertion that there was no Russian influence on the outcome, it's doing so without justification. When we contacted the Trump transition media office, we did not receive a response. Here’s our review of the publicly available evidence. Ballot counts The Trump camp has a point on one issue: Despite some concern among security experts going into the election that Russia might hack into state and local vote-counting systems and tamper with the tallies, the intelligence community report found that any such efforts by Russia were not successful in changing any votes. The report says that while ""Russian intelligence obtained and maintained access to elements of multiple U.S. state or local electoral boards,"" the Department of Homeland Security ""assesses that the types of systems Russian actors targeted or compromised were not involved in vote tallying."" Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif., the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, conceded this in an interview with the PBS NewsHour on Jan. 6. ""It is true there is no evidence that the tampering with voter machines or tampering with voter registrations or any of like that affected the counting of the votes. That's true,"" Schiff told PBS’ Judy Woodruff. Some observers might be concerned that Russia did manage to breach at least some election authorities’ computer networks, and they might also be concerned that Russia and Putin, according to the report, tried to influence the election, even if it’s less clear whether they succeeded. Still, Trump has a point that Russia didn’t literally change actual votes electronically. Ballot tampering vs. other types of Russian influence Members of the Trump camp have portrayed the report’s clean bill of health on the question of Russian ballot-tampering as proof that Russia had no impact at all on the election. For instance, on the Jan. 8 edition of CNN’s State of the Union, incoming White House counselor Kellyanne Conway told Jake Tapper that ""if you read the full report, they make very clear, (Director of National Intelligence James) Clapper in his testimony (to the Senate Armed Services Committee) made very clear on Thursday under oath that that any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed. They were not successful in doing that."" On Fox News Sunday, incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus echoed Conway’s invocation of Clapper’s testimony, saying Clapper had testified to the Senate panel ""that there is no evidence in the report that any of this changed the outcome of the election."" Neither assertion is accurate. First, to equate a lack of ballot tampering with a lack of any Russian influence on the election conflates two things that are not the same. Conway and Priebus essentially defined ballot-rigging as the only way an election can be influenced, when in reality the intelligence report primarily addresses other ways Russia tried to influence the election. The Russian effort blended, in the report’s words, ""covert intelligence operations — such as cyber activity — with overt efforts by Russian Government agencies, state-funded media, third-party intermediaries, and paid social media users or ‘trolls.’ "" And second, Clapper in his testimony never said that ""any attempt, any aspiration to influence our elections failed"" (as Conway put it) or that ""there is no evidence in the report that any of this changed the outcome of the election"" (as Priebus put it). Clapper’s most direct remark at the Senate hearing on this issue came in this exchange with the panel’s chairman, Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz.: McCain: ""So really, what we're talking about, is if they succeeded in changing the results of an election, of which none of us believe they were, that would have to constitute an attack on the United States of America because of the effects, if they had succeeded, would you agree with that?"" Clapper: ""First, we cannot say -- they did not change any vote tallies or -- or anything of that sort."" McCain: ""Yeah, I'm just talking about…"" Clapper: ""And we have no -- we have no way of gauging the impact that -- certainly the intelligence community can't gauge the impact it had on the choices the electorate made. There's no way for us to gauge that."" Subsequently in the hearing, Clapper arguably went even further in a response to questioning by Sen. Angus King, I-Maine. King, referring to his work with Baltic states that have been grappling with Russian influence in elections for several years, said, ""The best defense is for our public to know what's going on, so they can take it with a grain of salt. … That's why I think public hearings like this and the public discussion of this issue is so important, because we're not going to be able to prevent this all together. But we need to have our people understand that when they're being manipulated. Would you agree with that conclusion?"" Clapper responded, ""Absolutely. That's why I feel so strongly about the statement in October,"" referencing his own statement during the campaign that the Russian government had been engaged in efforts ""intended to interfere with the U.S. election process."" How credible is the argument that Russia influenced the election in some fashion? Schiff is one of many Democratic officials who personally believe that other types of Russian efforts may have had an impact on an election that ultimately hinged on fewer than 100,000 votes cumulatively in three states -- Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. In his PBS interview, Schiff specifically referred to the hacking and release to websites such as WikiLeaks of personal emails written and received by Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and other top Democrats -- releases that Trump prominently featured during the campaign. ""The daily dumping of information that was damaging to Secretary Clinton and helpful to Donald Trump was hugely consequential,"" Schiff said. But is it possible to move beyond a gut feeling and prove that Russia influenced enough voters to change the election’s outcome? Not really, say political scientists. A campaign as large-scale as a presidential race is buffeted by so many factors that it’s essentially impossible to know for sure that any given factor played a role in determining who won. ""The presidential election, with its national constituency, is decided by multiple, interrelated causes, all of which were necessary but not sufficient,"" said Kyle Saunders, a Colorado State University political scientist. Referring to such factors as the candidates’ personalities and messages as well as the general political environment, Saunders said that ""no one determinate cause can be offered as ‘the’ explanation, and doing so is a fool's errand."" Saunders agreed that one doesn’t have to believe that hacking did affect the election to say comfortably that Trump is wrong to say it absolutely didn’t affect the election -- there's simply no way of knowing either way with any certainty that something affected the outcome. He added that while a reasonable case can be made that the hacking did help Trump, that's informed speculation -- not certainty -- and said there’s no way to know how big a factor it may have been compared to other factors. ""It is difficult to argue that the barrage of damaging information released almost exclusively about Clinton and Democrats did no harm or did not create an atmosphere in which voters questioned her judgment or credibility or dampen support for her candidacy,"" said Costas Panagopoulos, a Fordham University political scientist. That said, Panagopoulos added, ""in truth, there is no way to know with certainty what the causal impact of Russian involvement was on the outcome of the 2016 election."" Our ruling After meeting with senior intelligence officials about the details of a soon-to-be-released report on alleged Russian hacking, Trump said that activities by foreign governments had ""absolutely no effect on the outcome of this election."" Trump can use the intelligence report to bolster this assertion only in one limited way -- that Russia did not succeed in tampering with vote counts (though it appears to have tried). On the broader issue of whether Russia had any impact on the outcome of the election, the report specifically noted that it didn’t address this issue, and Clapper in his Senate testimony didn’t either. Saying there was no Russian ballot-tampering is not the same thing as saying there was no Russian influence on the election. Political scientists say it’s impossible to move beyond informed speculation about whether there was a Russian impact on the election’s outcome -- or, importantly, whether there wasn’t an impact. Trump’s formulation, echoed by later statements by those in his camp, offers a definitive, broad-brush conclusion that isn’t proven by the evidence, and really can’t be. We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0A6BC0>],/factchecks/2017/jan/08/donald-trump/donald-trumps-dubious-claim-foreign-governments-ha/
"['National', 'Congress', 'Ethics', 'Cory Booker']","
Cory Booker: McConnell wanted full ethics review of Obama nominees before hearings
","Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell advocated for thorough vetting of President Barack Obama’s cabinet nominees, but he seems to have a different standard for President-elect Donald Trump’s, suggested New Jersey Democratic Sen. Cory Booker on CBS’ Face the Nation. The Republican-controlled Senate will hold several confirmation hearings for the week of Jan. 10, frustrating Democrats like Booker who say the jam-packed schedule was a move to deflect public attention from Trump’s more controversial nominees.   But back ""in 2009, Mitch McConnell was the person that’s saying, ‘Hey, we should have all the ethics information in before we do the hearings.’ I just was reviewing his letter this morning,"" Booker said Jan. 8, emphasizing that rigorous review is perhaps more important for Trump’s nominees given their wealth, international business ties and potential conflicts of interest. Is Booker right that McConnell advocated for complete ethical review for Obama’s appointees before holding confirmation hearings? Booker’s claim is accurate, though it may be a bit premature to charge McConnell with hypocrisy. The confirmation process  All cabinet-level positions as well as scores of senior-level personnel for executive branch agencies must be confirmed by the Senate. (Those who don’t have to be confirmed are positions that solely advise the president.) First, the president or president-elect selects, vets and submits nominations to the appropriate Senate committees. Then the committees typically hold investigations (using information provided by the White House and their own research) and hearings (for public debate over the nomination). Finally, after review, they report the nominations to the full Senate for a vote on the floor. According to the Congressional Research Service, the clearance stage includes submitting financial disclosure forms, completing background checks and signing ethics agreements that identify and outline ways to mitigate conflicts of interest, reviewed and certified by the Office of Government Ethic. This typically occurs before the nominations are submitted to the Senate.   The rules for confirmation vary by committee. All review a nominee’s biographical resume and some set of disclosure forms. Some also consult FBI background checks. Again, this information gathering often happens before a hearing, but is more often required before a vote. In a letter released by Senate Democrats, the director of the independent Office of Government Ethics, Walter Shaub, expressed concern that several of Trump’s nominees with scheduled hearings have yet to complete the ethics review process as of Jan. 6, 2017. ""I am not aware of any occasion in the four decades since OGE was established when the Senate held a confirmation hearing before the nominee had completed the ethics review,"" Shaub wrote. ""In fact, OGE has not received even the initial draft financial disclosure reports for some of the nominees scheduled for hearings."" Out of the Trump picks with confirmation hearings scheduled, ethics forms have been submitted for attorney general nominee Sen. Jeff Sessions, secretary of state nominee Rex Tillerson, defense secretary nominee James Mattis and transportation secretary nominee Elaine Chao, according to the Associated Press. It’s unclear if forms have been submitted for CIA director nominee Rep. Mike Pompeo, homeland security secretary nominee Gen. John Kelly, and housing secretary nominee Ben Carson. Forms have not been submitted for education secretary nominee Betsy DeVos or commerce secretary Wilbur Ross. McConnell’s letter Experts agreed with Booker’s characterization of McConnell’s letter, sent to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid dated Feb. 12, 2009. ""Prior to considering any time agreements on the floor on any nominee,"" McConnell wrote, ranking members expect eight ethical standards to be met. Among them: a completed FBI background check, a completed Office of Government Ethics letter, completed financial disclosure statements (and tax returns where they apply) and a completed committee questionnaires submitted to the respective Senate committees ""prior to a hearing being noticed."" In layman’s terms, McConnell not only required for ""completion of disclosures but also review prior to floor consideration,"" said Wayne Steger, a political science professor at DePaul University and the author of A Citizen’s Guide to Presidential Nominations. ""The ethics review process had to be complete before he would agree to set aside the right to filibuster nominations,"" said Steven Smith, a political science professor at Washington University in St. Louis and expert on Senate procedure. Booker’s office also referred us to a 2009 Roll Call article on McConnell’s letter. ""Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Thursday threatened to filibuster any of President Barack Obama’s executive branch nominations if they do not meet what he deemed a series of ‘standards’ for installment,"" the article reads (full version here). McConnell’s office, meanwhile, argued that Booker mischaracterized the letter. McConnell’s communications director David Popp pointed out that by the time McConnell sent letter on Feb. 12, the Senate had already held hearings for everyone Obama nominated. This is accurate, and all but one of the 13 nominees was confirmed before Feb. 12. ""If you read the letter, it simply calls for continuing the best practices and precedents of the Senate — it does not ask for new preconditions the way Sen. Booker and other Democrats are now doing, such as calling for the tax returns of all nominees, rather than only in those committees that regularly request returns,"" he said. Appearing right before Booker on Face the Nation, McConnell dismissed concerns from Democrats as sour grapes disguised as ""little procedural complaints"" and emphasized the need to get Trump’s national security team up and running on day one. He suggested his ethical standards hadn’t changed and said there is still time to comply. After all, ""we are still in the process of getting the papers in. I think at least five of the nominees have all of their papers in,"" he said. ""The real thing is the vote on the floor, and we want to have all of the records in, all of the papers completed before they are actually confirmed on the Senate floor."" The ruling Booker said, ""In 2009, Mitch McConnell was the person that’s saying, 'Hey, we should have all the ethics information in before we do the hearings.' "" McConnell wrote a letter on Feb. 12, 2009 that advocated for completion of disclosure forms before hearings and as a condition of floor consideration. But most of the the people Obama nominated by the time of McConnell's letter had already been approved.

Half True: Dan Patrick on Martin Luther King saying lives start to 'end the day we become silent'
","Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick opened his full-throated endorsement of Texas legislation targeting transgender access to bathrooms by quoting the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Patrick, joined by the proposal’s author, state Sen. Lois Kolkhorst, told reporters at the Texas Capitol on Jan. 5, 2017: ""Martin Luther King said our lives begin to end the day we become silent on things that matter. ""This legislation, the Texas Privacy Act, that Sen. Kolkhorst is filing today, is unquestionably one of the things that matters,"" Patrick said. ""It’s the right thing to do. I know it, Texans know it and Sen. Kolkhorst knows it."" Debate over the measure--banning transgender people from using the Texas bathroom of their choice--will play out in the 2017 legislative session. We focused on the origin of Patrick’s King quotation. Patrick offers no backup We didn’t hear back from Patrick about when and where the slain civil rights leader made the singled-out statement, which went noted in the Associated Press’s account of Patrick’s remarks and quoted by the Dallas Morning News. For our part, a web search for the quotation and ""King"" suggested by a professor yielded 2,980 results including books of poetry and documentation that President Clinton similarly quoted King in an April 2000 speech and Sen. Joe Lieberman did so in the Senate in June 2003. So, Patrick was in bipartisan company in crediting the words to King. On the other hand, we were unable to confirm that King made that exact declaration. Also, it’s worth noting, King probably didn’t expound on bathrooms except toward widening access to public facilities. A photo caption We started our look into this topic by trying to gauge if King said the words aired by Patrick. Right off, a web search yielded an undated New York Daily News photo of King giving a speech. The photo caption said: ""King was engaged in a battle with Sheriff Jim Clark over voting rights and voter registration in Selma. On March 8, 1965, King spoke from the pulpit on courage: ‘Our lives begin to end the day we become silent about things that matter.’"" Stanford researchers can’t confirm Separately, though, King experts either said he likely didn’t make the quoted remark or if he did, it’s hard to confirm so with ease. ""That would be a research project,"" said Clayborne Carson, the Martin Luther King, Jr., Centennial professor of history at Stanford University and director of a research institute in King’s name. By phone, Carson told us that’s because the institute’s resources aren’t yet easily searched for a particular quotation. Put another way, he said by email, it’s ""easier to prove what King said on a particular occasion than to prove that he never said the quote in question on any occasion."" An institute research assistant, Ellen Ingebritsen, later responded that her search of the project’s internal database and documents culled from the institute's King papers didn’t turn up King making the statement. Then again, she said, the institute has yet to catalogue the majority of King’s work from 1965. Otherwise, she said, King letters and telegrams from that year don’t contain the words attributed to King by Patrick. A similar confirmed King statement Story over? Not quite. Other experts helped us find that King made a similar yet less direct statement in the Brown Chapel in Selma, Ala., on Monday, March 8, 1965--the same date noted in the News’s photo caption and also the day after protesters met police violence after attempting to cross a bridge on the way to Montgomery, the state capital. King, who would shortly lead a crossing of the bridge before turning around, said in part: ""A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true."" Here’s King’s remark in context as we found it on an East Tennessee State University web page: ""Deep down in our non-violent creed is the conviction there are some things so dear, some things so precious, some things so eternally true, that they're worth dying for. And if a man happens to be 36-years-old, as I happen to be, some great truth stands before the door of his life--some great opportunity to stand up for that which is right. ""A man might be afraid his home will get bombed, or he's afraid that he will lose his job, or he's afraid that he will get shot, or beat down by state troopers, and he may go on and live until he's 80. He's just as dead at 36 as he would be at 80. The cessation of breathing in his life is merely the belated announcement of an earlier death of the spirit. He died... ""A man dies when he refuses to stand up for that which is right. A man dies when he refuses to stand up for justice. A man dies when he refuses to take a stand for that which is true. ""So we're going to stand up amid horses. We're going to stand up right here in Alabama, amid the billy-clubs. We're going to stand up right here in Alabama amid police dogs, if they have them. We're going to stand up amid tear gas! ""We're going to stand up amid anything they can muster up, letting the world know that we are determined to be free!"" To our inquiry, Doug Burgess, chairman of the university’s history department, said by phone that he posted the excerpt some 15 years ago. Burgess also helped us track down a YouTube video in which we saw King making the remarks, which the video attributes to a Nostalgia Company recording, ""The Greatest Speeches of All Time, Volume II."" Separately, Carson told us his research took note of a similar King statement made Nov. 5, 1967, at his home church in Atlanta. King, exhorting parishioners to fight for what’s right, said a person’s failure to do so would amount to dying before death. ""You died when you refused to stand up for right, you died when you refused to stand up for truth, you died when you refused to stand up for justice,"" Carson quoted King saying. We also heard back from a King biographer, David Garrow, who said by email that his sense is that King didn’t make the statement aired by Patrick. That ""language does *NOT* in any way sound familiar to me as an exact quote,"" Garrow wrote. ""I believe it is INVALID."" Garrow summed up: ""Your verdict on this ought to be something like 'Unproven, undocumented, & highly doubtful.’"" Texas professors: Quotation out of context Asked to assess Patrick’s quotation, University of Texas historians Don Carleton and Paul Stekler each opined that Patrick presented King’s sentiment out of historical context. Stekler, who helped produce, direct and write a documentary on the civil rights movement in 1967-68, said by email that King ""was in Selma to try and force federal action to ensure voting rights, a campaign that was successful with the passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in the aftermath of the police riot on the Edmund Pettus Bridge.  He was advocating the expansion of rights for African-Americans in the South where they had been and were largely disenfranchised."" Patrick, Stekler wrote, employed King’s purported words in support of restricting the rights of transgender people. ""One use of the quote uses it in support of the expansion of rights, the other in restricting rights,"" Stekler said. Our ruling Per Patrick, King said our lives begin to end the day we become silent on things that matter. Patrick didn’t show nor did we confirm that King made this direct statement. Then again, Patrick didn’t specify he was quote-unquote directly quoting King while King in 1965 made a longer proclamation that might later have been paraphrased in the 14 words that Patrick and others including President Clinton ultimately attributed to the civil rights icon.

If you believe the Internet, he’s also fond of the residents of Marion, Ohio. And Shakopee, Minn., too. And Hays, Kan.; Porterville, Calif.; Prescott Valley, Ariz.; Bay City, Mich.; and even Toowoomba, Australia. All for the same reason, none of which is true. A website called NewsDaily12.com said it had the story from Rochester, in which Murray is quoted from an unidentified radio interview as saying he was leaving the New England town when his rental car ""overheated or something."" Facebook flagged this story and others as part of its efforts to identify fake news. They’re right. It’s fake. Murray’s undated anecdote continues that while on the phone with the car company, a couple of locals lent a hand, calling a family member with a tow truck and taking the car to get repaired. While waiting, one of the Samaritans offers to take Murray to lunch, the story goes. ""So we drove to the finest dining spot in Rochester — some place called Wild Willy’s — and get a burger. Great freakin’ burger too,"" Murray is quoted. ""These guys had no idea who I was either which made my day, honestly. I’m telling you, these people in Rochester are the real deal. I’m gonna move there after I retire."" The stories, which again, are fake, are part of a chain of websites that appear to bank on readers clicking on particular versions of the post to generate advertising revenue. These sites carry names that sound like official media outlets, like ""KMT 11 News"" or ""16 WMPO."" The sites are also known for including various versions of stories that falsely claim an event has happened. Other stories include that a celebrity is moving to a certain town or, say, that the next Star Wars movie is being filmed nearby. None of the stories specifically say the article is fake. But each site has a disclaimer (if you know where to look) that says the articles ""are simply works of satire meant for entertainment purposes"" and shouldn’t be considered true. (Claiming that these articles are somehow satire is bogus, too.) Each site says readers may submit concerns to a contact email, and the administrators ""will offer you our condolences and provide you with a safe space where you can be shielded from any sort of satire in the future."" We emailed them looking for condolences, but so far have received none. Every version of the story on each site is almost identical, with the name of a different town. The lunch destination is either changed or omitted altogether, depending on the version. (To the fake news purveyor’s faint credit, the name of the restaurant used is of an actual place in the specific town — there really is a burger joint called Wild Willy’s in Rochester, for example.) Something that also changes in the stories is the name of the celebrity having the experience. It’s not always Bill Murray. It also turns out that Adam Sandler had the same problem in Pflugerville, Texas. And Billings, Mont.; plus a flat tire in Reynoldsburg, Ohio; and a whole host of other towns. Tom Hanks got a flat tire in Kennewick, Wash.; Harrison Ford’s car overheated in Mandan, N.D.; Miley Cyrus broke down in Hollister, Calif. Other celebrities helped by gentle townsfolk after some bad luck include Jennifer Aniston, Morgan Freeman, Woody Harrelson, Adam Levine, Matthew McConaughey and Bruce Willis. There are scads of small towns and suburbs named as the location of these hapless incidents. Needless to say, there is no evidence that any of these celebs had car trouble in any of these places or subsequently praised locals for help. We rate these claims Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x0000028098155940>],/factchecks/2017/jan/06/blog-posting/celebrity-praise-helpful-locals-are-fake-stories-c/

Yes, Asia is the most water-strapped continent
","Americans are up to their eyebrows in water, relatively speaking. Other parts of the world aren’t as fortunate. A prominent Indian analyst, Brahma Chellaney, has been sounding the alarm for many years about the tightening competition for water in Asia. ""Averting water-related conflicts is actually a major challenge across Asia, which has less freshwater per capita than any other continent, except Antarctica,"" Chellaney wrote in a Dec. 28 op-ed. ""This reality has helped promote growing interstate and intrastate disputes over shared water resources."" We wanted to verify that, indeed, the average Asian has less water at hand than the residents of other continents. Aquastat, a project of the United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization, is the go-to source for information on how much water is potentially available for human use. In Aquastat’s 2016 summary, Asia had about 2,000 gallons per day available for each person. The project website states, ""Asia is the continent with the lowest volume of renewable freshwater resources per person."" The Asian average compares to 14,700 gallons per person per day in North America, 22,900 gallons per person per day in South America, and 5,400 gallons per person per day in Australia. Aquastat, unfortunately, has no summary data for Europe or Africa. We used another UN data source for a back-of-the-envelope calculation. It supports Chellaney’s essential point about relative scarcity in Asia. A 2008 report from the United Nations Environment Program provides estimates of the freshwater that exists on each continent. (It too has gaps. It has no estimate for surface water in South America and estimating groundwater in Australia is tricky because much of that water is infused with salt.) We divided the totals by population estimates based on Population Reference Bureau data. Asia still comes in last, at least among continents that have year-round residents. But contrary to Chellaney’s assertion, Antarctica is flooded with freshwater. The problem is, it’s all frozen. The UN Environment Program said Antarctica had over 30 million cubic kilometers of freshwater locked up in its glaciers and ice. And aside from about 1,000 researchers who spend time there, it has no people. So technically, Antarctica has more freshwater per capita than anywhere. Practically speaking though, comparing continental water supplies is always a bit misleading because the water that’s actually available varies hugely from place to place within each continent, and often within each country. Southern China has plenty of water, while the north is dry. For India, the northwest is much drier than the eastern sections of the country. Plus, as the staff at Aquastat note, estimates of total water supply don’t mean that the water is ""fully exploitable and available."" Some is in remote locations, the amount can swing widely between wet and dry seasons, some might need to be reserved to sustain the environment, and often, technical challenges put the water out of reach of pumping stations and other infrastructure. Asia’s looming water problems have drawn increasing attention in recent years. A 2016 projection from researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology concluded that ""there is a high risk of severe water stress in densely populated watersheds by 2050."" The MIT group compared a number of scenarios and determined that most of the pressure stemmed from a growing population and increasing demands from a rising economy, rather than climate change. By 2050, they estimated about 1 billion people could be pressed to meet their daily water needs. ""Without assertive water policies in these regions, water limitations could be harmful to the health and well being of the people in these regions, as well as the environment,"" they wrote. Our ruling Chellaney said that Asia has less freshwater per capita than any other continent, except Antarctica. Technically, he’s wrong about Antarctica, which has plenty of freshwater in its glaciers, but practically speaking, he’s correct. The UN’s primary project on water statistics reports that Asia has the lowest amount of freshwater resources per person. We used an alternative data set and while the numbers differed, Asia still ranked last among places where people actually live. We rate this claim Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/35f9e7a4-9ead-4d2e-9d8e-6da1c0bd139a",[<zip object at 0x0000028096FADB40>],/factchecks/2017/jan/06/brahma-chellaney/yes-asia-most-water-strapped-continent/

Claim that John Podesta's email password was 'password' lacks evidence
","It’s known that John Podesta, Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman, was tricked into giving his email password to hackers believed to have Russian ties. But now a rumor is spreading that his email password wasn’t much of a secret at all. It was simply ""password."" ""What happened was John Podesta gave his password to a hacker. And guess what his password was. 'Password,' "" said Fox News' Jesse Watters on Jan. 4. ""It’s a true story. His password was ‘password.’ "" That’d be funny, if it were true. The thing is, there’s no material evidence to support the claim that Podesta violated a very basic tenet of Internet safety. None shall pass The first person to say that Podesta’s email password was ""password"" was Julian Assange, whose website WikiLeaks published the emails stolen from Podesta. ""We published several Podesta emails, which show Podesta responding to a phishing email,"" Assange said on Fox Jan. 3. ""Now, how did they respond? Podesta gave out that his password was the word ‘password.’ "" ""So this is something a 14-year-old kid could have hacked,"" Assange added. We don’t know where Assange’s claim comes from. None of the emails published on WikiLeaks show Podesta’s email password. And of the cyber analysts examining the phishing emails used to infiltrate Podesta’s and others’ accounts, none have made similar claims. Further, Podesta was using a Gmail account, and Google doesn’t allow users to make their passwords ""password."" Go try for yourself. We did:  Perhaps Assange is thinking of a February 2015 email in the WikiLeaks dump. In that email, a staffer tells Podesta that his Windows 8 login on what appears to be a new work computer is username: jpodesta and password: [email protected] Interestingly, in another email sent in May 2015, the same staffer tells Podesta his Apple ID password: Runner4567. So we have two of Podesta’s passwords, but neither are for his email account. In fairness to Assange, Watters and others pushing the email password claim: Both of these passwords are far too simple to be effective. So it’s possible Podesta similarly made his email password overly simplistic. But we don’t know that for sure, and we surely don’t know if his email password was just ""password."" Pro tip: If you don’t want to end up like Podesta, check out this guide to protecting yourself online, written by cyber crime expert Marc Goodman. Our ruling Watters said Podesta’s email password was ""password."" There is no material evidence to back up this claim. Google doesn’t even allow Gmail users to make their password ""password.""

Parenting blog falsely claims Vicks VapoRub was fatal
","Here’s a scary story. A mother in Mexico thinks that her 2-year-old has a cold and puts Vicks VapoRub on his chest and under his nose. She lies down next to him and when she wakes, she finds the child dead. The tale began moving through the Web in November. Smag31.com, a website that targets young mothers, carried it on Nov. 25 with the headline, ""Mom applies a remedy to her baby, moments later he dies."" But so far as anyone can tell, the story is untrue. Vicks VapoRub has been tied to breathing problems in infants and toddlers, but not to any deaths. The post was flagged by Facebook users as part of the social media giant’s crackdown on fake news. Bruce Rubin, chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Virginia Commonwealth University, has followed questions about Vicks VapoRub for a decade. In 2009, he published a peer-reviewed article based on a case he had encountered a few years before. The parents of an 18-month-old had put Vicks under the child’s nose and the child immediately stopped breathing. They quickly turned the child upside down, slapped it on the back and it coughed up a plug of mucus. Its breathing returned to normal. But Rubin told us that in the 10 years since that case, he’s seen no report of any deaths. On the other hand, episodes of breathing distress while rare, are not unheard of. ""I understand that there have been about 30 such reports, all with Vicks under the nose of very small children,"" Rubin said. ""Procter and Gamble (the maker of Vicks) specifically states never to use this directly under the nose at any age, and never use at all in children under the age of 2."" To underscore, that is what the label says. Never under the nose. Never with kids under 2. A 2012 study looked at what happens when menthol, one of Vicks’ active ingredients, is inhaled. It found that the body responds by making more mucus, but again, the authors cited no example of a child actually dying. Jennifer Lowry, head of toxicology at Children’s Mercy Hospital in Kansas City and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics’ environmental health council, said, ""I have never heard, nor could I find a report of, a patient dying from inhaling Vicks VapoRub."" Lowry said as a pediatric medical toxicologist, she has concerns about any product that contains camphor, as Vicks does. But her main worry is that parents will do exactly the wrong thing and have kids eat it. That’s very dangerous. Procter and Gamble spokeswoman Velvet Gogol Bennett said the company has never had a family report a fatality due to inhaling Vicks VapoRub. ""We have had no local health authority notification, no hospital notification, nor any doctor or any official news organization anywhere in the world has brought this case to our attention,"" Bennett said. ""Despite all of our efforts to investigate this social media posting, there is no verifiable information in terms of city and name of the person concerned."" The blog post about the alleged death said, ""The medical report stated the child died due to inflammation in the respiratory track, produced by the camphor contained in the famous ointment."" If such a medical report exists, no researcher we contacted seems to have ever seen it. We reached out to the author behind the blog and did not hear back. The myth-busting website Snopes also looked into this and found it lacked substance. A Canadian study looked at cases of children eating Vicks or similar products. Those situations sent children to the emergency room, but were not fatal. The one exception was in 1983 involving a child with pneumonia whose parents had given him a home remedy that contained camphor and alcohol. Rubin said if people follow instructions, Vicks is fine: ""If you are an adult with a stuffy head cold, putting Vicks on your chest and drinking some hot tea with honey (and perhaps rum) is as good a medicine as it gets. Just keep the Vicks (and the rum) away from the under-2 crowd."" Our ruling A blog post said that Vicks VapoRub caused a child’s death in Mexico. While the product has been tied to breathing problems in infants and toddlers, there is no evidence that it has been fatal.

Federal government doesn't give information on Syrian refugees who come to Wisconsin?
","In year-end media interviews, Gov. Scott Walker amplified his safety concerns about the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s review of refugees who come to Wisconsin, particularly from Syria. ""We want to make sure Homeland Security's got an aggressive and appropriate vetting process, to have an idea who's coming in, where they're coming from, how long they're anticipating being here,"" Walker said on the Dec. 23, 2016 edition of ""Here and Now,"" a Wisconsin Public Television show. ""Right now, we don't get any of that information. And as you can imagine, it's frustrating for us, it's frustrating for law enforcement. And it's not to say that refugees aren't legit; we've had refugees before, we'll have refugees going forward from any number of countries. We just want to make sure we can guarantee our safety."" Is Walker right that authorities in Wisconsin don’t know who the refugees are who settle in the state, where they’re from and how long they’re likely to stay? Federal vetting process After terrorist attacks in Paris in November 2015, Walker and other Wisconsin Republicans said they opposed the settling of Syrian refugees in the state. They have not laid out a plan for ensuring that doesn't happen. But in one of his 2016 year-end interviews, Walker called on President-elect Donald Trump to immediately clear federal barriers to keeping Syrian refugees out of the state. Refugees, to be clear, are different from other types of immigrants. A refugee has been legally defined as having ""a well-founded fear of persecution because of his or her race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion; is outside his or her country of origin""; and is unable to return there ""for fear of persecution."" Trump and other Republicans have denounced the sufficiency of the federal vetting of refugees. And there’s no question there are challenges to screening refugees from conflict zones such as Syria, where intelligence and national security officials have said there is minimal data on individuals. Nevertheless, vetting is a multi-step, multi-agency process, in place since 1980, that includes additional screening of refugees coming from Syria. As PolitiFact National has reported, here is the process generally: 1. The United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees determines who is eligible as a refugee. 2. Refugees referred to the United States are vetted through a process that involves multiple federal intelligence and security agencies. Their names, biographical information and fingerprints are run through databases coordinated by the FBI, and the departments of State, Homeland Security and Defense.

(For Syrian refugees, there’s one additional step (more details here). Their filings with the UN and initial documents submitted to the U.S. program are reviewed. Information about where they came from, what caused them to flee and what their experiences were like are cross-referenced with classified and unclassified information.) 3. While the checks are being conducted, Homeland Security officers interview the refugees in person. Refugees who’ve been cleared by an officer, the State Department and the background checks then undergo medical screenings, a match with a sponsor agency, ""cultural orientation"" classes and one final security clearance. This process (more details here) typically takes one to two years, if not longer, and happens before a refugee ever gets onto American soil. Notifications in states With regard to Walker’s statement, two nonprofits -- Amnesty International USA and the U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants -- told us that state governments generally are not given lists of the names of refugees who are resettled in their states. But that’s something of a red herring. Refugees approved for settling in the United States, like other legal immigrants, have a right to live where they want and to move about. The experts pointed out that the state government or local law enforcement agencies generally are not notified when any person who is legally in the United States moves into their state. That’s not to say no one in Wisconsin knows when refugees first arrive. In fact, preparations are made in advance, in an effort to choose a community where a refugee is likely to assimilate. According to the two nonprofit agencies and David Martin, an emeritus professor of international law at the University of Virginia who’s previously held posts at Homeland Security and the State Department, here is an overview of the process: 1. Non-profit agencies that have offices throughout the United States -- including Catholic Charities and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Services -- have contracts with the U.S. State Department to do refugee resettlement. Those agencies are given the names, home countries and other information about refugees approved by the Department of Homeland Security, such as whether they have family in the United States. 2. At the national level, the agencies meet weekly to decide, in consultation with the State Department, where the approved refugees should be resettled, based on their individual circumstances and local resources. In turn, those agencies’ local offices are notified and resettlement plans are put in place specifically for the refugees, covering housing, job assistance, language classes and other needs. Once the final vetting is completed, the local agencies meet the refugees when they arrive and begin the process of helping them settle. In addition, the private agencies coordinate with state refugee services workers who are federally funded employees of the state Department of Children and Families. So, it’s not as though the state is in the dark about refugee resettlement. Two final points: 1. Some information about refugee resettlements is readily available on the website of the federal Refugee Processing Center. We did a search that showed that in 2016, 1,877 refugees were placed in Wisconsin, with nearly half coming from Burma (also known as Myanmar) in Southeast Asia. Here are the five largest groups:   Country Refugees settled in Wisconsin in 2016 Burma 979 Democratic Republic of the Congo 262 Somalia 216 Iraq 144 Syria 119 2. Given that refugees are coming to the United States because life is not safe for them in their homeland, and it’s been a years-long process to get admitted to the U.S., the stays are not viewed as temporary. ""The strong presumption is that it’s permanent,"" said Martin. Refugees who stay for a year without committing a crime can then get a ""green card"" and become a permanent U.S. resident, he said. Walker spokesman Tom Evenson said Walker’s complaint is that the governor’s office doesn’t receive any information about refugees placed in Wisconsin until after decisions have been made by the federal government. ""The state has no authority regarding who is coming to our state, when they are coming and where they are coming from,"" Evenson said. But, to reiterate, the vetting of refugees is a federal matter. And once people have legally arrived in the United States -- immigrants, refugees, etc. -- they are generally free to live where they want without notification to, or approval from, the state. Our rating Walker said: ""We don't get any of that information"" from the federal government on who refugees are, where they come from and how long they are likely to stay. Walker has a point in that, after vetting the refugees and approving their entrance to the United States, the federal government does not provide lists of the names of those individuals to states. But that’s something of a red herring -- states don’t get lists of other people who are legally in the United States and are generally free to move about and reside wherever they want. Data on the numbers of refugees, where they came and where they settle is available -- and Wisconsin state government has refugee services workers who coordinate with private agencies in the settlement of refugees. As for Walker’s point about length of stay, it doesn’t really fit, given that refugees fleeing their homeland generally are settling in the United States permanently. For a statement that has an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, our rating is Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A362400>],/factchecks/2017/jan/06/scott-walker/federal-government-doesnt-give-information-syrian-/

Trump performed best in Erie County since Reagan
","President-elect Donald Trump did not win Erie County in the November election. But he did well enough in upstate New York’s largest concentration of Democrats to excite Erie County Republican Chairman Nick Langworthy. ""Donald Trump performed better than any presidential nominee since Gerald Ford, and we found that to be substantial,"" Langworthy told WBFO, the NPR member station in Buffalo. ""He carried towns that haven't gone Republican in years and years in a presidential election, towns like West Seneca and Hamburg. And, he won Cheektowaga, a critical town."" So did Trump really get better results in Erie County than any Republican nominee since Gerald Ford?  Difference in votes Langworthy based his claim on the margin between Trump and Hillary Clinton, his Democratic rival. She won 27,153 more votes than Trump in Erie County, according to the Erie County Board of Elections. That’s a tighter margin than in any previous presidential election since 1984, when Democrat Walter Mondale beat Reagan by 15,049 votes in Erie County. Ford’s margin was even tighter in 1976, when he lost to Jimmy Carter by 9,087 votes in Erie County. Number of votes We also looked at the total number of votes the candidates received. Trump received 188,303 votes in Erie County in the 2016 election -- more votes in Erie County for a Republican candidate for president since 1988, when George H.W. Bush won 188,796 votes. Reagan received 222,882 votes in his 1984 re-election race. Ford won 220,310 votes in Erie County in 1976. Percentage of votes Looking at the candidates’ percentage of the vote - not their vote counts - offers a more accurate gauge of their strength because Erie County’s population has fallen since the 1970s. Trump won 44.4 percent of the total vote in Erie County - excluding blank and voided ballots - in the 2016 election. That is the highest percentage for a Republican candidate since the 1984 election, when Reagan won 48.2 percent of the county vote. Ford won 48.7 percent of the vote in his race in 1976. Our ruling Langworthy said ""Donald Trump performed better than any presidential nominee since Gerald Ford"" in Erie County. When we reached Langworthy to ask about his claim, he acknowledged his mistake. He said he made the claim before he had the official results from the county Board of Elections. ""I think it’s significant that he performed as well as he did,"" Langworthy said of Trump’s vote tally in Erie County. ""My point is that Democrats came over to vote for him."" Trump won the highest percentage of the Erie County vote for president since the 1984 election. Trump did better than any Republican candidate since Reagan - not Ford. Reagan’s number of votes and percentage of votes were higher than Trump’s.

Illinois GOP press secretary makes $8 million Twitter leap over Democrat’s paycheck lawsuit
","In early December, a group of House Democrats filed a lawsuit in response to former Illinois Comptroller Leslie Geissler Munger’s decision to delay lawmakers’ pay. Munger had announced in April lawmaker pay would not be processed above any other state payments as she decided which bills to pay in the midst of an ongoing budget crisis. The lawsuit, filed by state Rep. Kate Cloonen, D-Kankakee, and five other Democrats, claimed Munger’s actions are unconstitutional and violate the separation of executive and legislative powers.   Aaron DeGroot, the Illinois Republican Party’s downstate press secretary, was among many who criticized the Democrats’ lawsuit as being driven by personal greed. To make his point, DeGroot tweeted about Cloonen and the Democrats’ lawsuit, adding to an earlier tweet from the Illinois Republican Party account.   ""For Kate Cloonen, $8.5 million in state contracts for her construction company isn’t enough. She needs that extra $68k/year,"" DeGroot wrote.   DeGroot’s tweet implies Cloonen made $8.5 million from the state in construction work and now she wants to be paid $68,000 for her legislative work, too. We decided to determine whether the dollar amounts are accurate, whether the practice of doing state business while also lawmaking was legal and ethical, whether comparing the numbers is relevant and what they tell us about Cloonen’s income. We’ll tackle these questions by looking at Illinois procurement law, talking to Cloonen and speaking to a political science expert about the ethics. Lawmaker pay vs. business profits Cloonen’s salary for a year of legislative work is $67,836, according to the comptroller’s office. According to her LinkedIn page, she has owned the Bonfield-based rebar installation company, JK Steel Erectors, Inc., for 25 years. Her involvement with JK Steel Erectors was scrutinized during her race against Republican Lindsay Parkhurst for the 79th House District. Since Cloonen took office in 2013, JK Steel Erectors has taken on several projects from the state, according to a document DeGroot received through a Freedom of Information Act request filed with the Illinois Department of Transportation. We reviewed this document and IDOT Director of Communications Guy Tridgell verified its accuracy. The document said JK Steel Erectors received $8.53 million on work done for the state since Jan. 18, 2013. In a phone interview, Cloonen said she also reviewed the IDOT document and said there were several instances where the compensation listed was incorrect, but she declined to provide details. ""I’m not sure where he got the $8 million number from,"" Cloonen said. ""No one knows what I netted but me because it’s a private business and I’m a private owner."" Cloonen raises a valid point. While her firm was paid $8.53 million, how much her firm profited from that gross total and how much she personally netted are entirely different from her individual gross salary as a lawmaker. The legality of holding office while owning a business  There also is nothing prohibiting Cloonen or any other Illinois lawmakers from holding another private job outside the legislature, according to the Illinois Constitution (Article IV, Section 2). Illinois General Assembly jobs are considered part-time, too. There are instances showing Cloonen made efforts to avoid any conflicts of interest during her time as a representative. For example, Cloonen normally votes present (instead of voting ""yes"" or ""no"") on any bills containing capital programs because of her role with JK Steel Erectors. When asked about his tweet, DeGroot said he never called Cloonen’s actions illegal. DeGroot said that during the election Parkhurst accused Cloonen of profiting off the taxpayers by using what they describe as a ""loophole"" in the Illinois Procurement Code which only prohibits officeholders from making other income from the state who make more than 60 percent of the governor’s $177,000 salary. In 2013, the Illinois Procurement Policy Board reviewed an instance where JK Steel Erectors was selected by Kankakee Valley Construction Co. to work on a bridge removal and replacement in Iroquois County. The board cited section 50-13 of the procurement code to clear her of any conflict. JK Steel Erectors was able to proceed with the subcontract work.   Aside from her salary situation clearing her from a problem, Cloonen also pointed out JK Steel Erectors is a subcontractor. That means her business never does any direct bidding on state projects. Her company is only hired by a contractor once it wins a bid. Tridgell at IDOT verified that in an email exchange, saying, ""The selection of registered subcontractors on projects is up to the discretion of the prime contractor."" Attack the system, not the person  Kent Redfield, a professor emeritus of political science at the University of Illinois-Springfield, said DeGroot shouldn’t attack Cloonen for keeping a business while holding office. After all, Redfield said, Cloonen was never found to have engaged in any wrongdoing. ""I don’t think you can fault her,"" Redfield said. ""She has certainly complied with the law. Does [her position] create a conflict of interest? Yes. Is there any indication she acted unethically? No."" Redfield said if DeGroot is intent on figuring out a way to eliminate conflicts of interest in the General Assembly, he should be focusing on changing the system. ""If Cloonen’s situation is being characterized as a loophole, then it is incumbent of Republicans to introduce legislation to change that,"" he said. ""As long as people comply with the law and are transparent with their relationships, it’s not fair to attack them."" The only way to truly avoid conflicts of interest, Redfield said, is to make lawmakers step away from any outside employment the minute they come into office. ""Then you know the legislator is making decisions that don’t benefit them financially,"" he said. Our ruling  On Dec. 2, Illinois Republican Party’s Downstate Press Secretary Aaron DeGroot tweeted: ""For Kate Cloonen, $8.5 million in state contracts for her construction company isn't enough. She needs that extra $68k/year"" According to a document verified by IDOT, Cloonen’s company received $8.5 million in state construction funding for projects during her time as a legislator. Cloonen said that number is not an accurate reflection of what she personally netted from the state construction work, but she declined to share that amount. DeGroot’s tweet, though, lacks context and tries to draw a comparison between an individual salary and a company’s gross payment, not net profit, for work completed. Cloonen’s construction company only acted as a subcontractor and never directly bid on any state projects. Cloonen never was found to have a conflict of interest, and she recused herself from most votes regarding capital projects. And while political science professor emeritus Kent Redfield said Cloonen may have a conflict of interest being both a lawmaker and a business owner, he also said she operated within the law and did not act unethically. Though DeGroot’s comment about Cloonen was accurate, it omits significant information, including the fact that Cloonen was a subcontractor not hired directly by the state and regularly recuses herself from voting on capital problems.

College graduates in New York owe about $30,000 in student loans on average
","Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said high levels of student loan debt motivated his proposal for free tuition at any public university or community college in New York state for students from families earning less than $125,000 a year. ""It is incredibly expensive, and the debt is so high it’s like starting a race with an anchor tied to your leg,"" Cuomo said of paying for college.  ""Average college debt -- $30,000 per student."" The governor’s office projected 210,000 students would seek the benefit. If so, the program would cost the state $163 million annually by 2019. So is Cuomo right about the average student debt load in New York state? The average debt load The Federal Reserve Bank of New York collected 2015 data on student loan debt in the state. The Fed reports 17.9 percent of consumers in New York state have a student loan, and their average college debt is $32,200. That’s higher than the national average of $29,700, the Fed said. The debt steadily increased for a decade. According to a September report from the State Comptroller’s office, the average student debt load in New York State increased by more than 47 percent between 2005 and 2015. The national average grew by 56 percent. Total student debt statewide more than doubled during that time period. The Institute for College Access & Success, an independent, non-profit organization, pegged the average debt of the state’s college graduates in 2015 at $29,320. That ranked 18th highest among the states. Fifty-nine percent of the students graduated with debt, the organization said. The average debt among graduates of State University of New York campuses was generally lower than their private college counterparts. The average debt for University at Buffalo graduates was $26,165, followed by those at Binghamton University, $25,844; SUNY Albany, $25,727; and Stony Brook University, $23,542. The average debt for graduates fluctuated among private colleges in New York state. Among the higher averages were incurred by graduates of Ithaca College, $39,771; Rochester Institute of Technology, $38,198; St. Bonaventure University, $38,073; Fordham University, $37,607; and Syracuse University, $36,500, according to the institute. The average debt was lower - but still significant - for graduates at other private universities: Colgate University, $20,859; Cornell University, $24,394; Clarkson University, $29,000; New York University, $30,480;  St. John’s University, $33,179. Our ruling Cuomo said the average college debt for those who borrowed for college in New York state is ""$30,000 per student."" Cuomo gets it right, according to the Institute for College Access & Success, which analyzed debt for 2015 graduates in New York State.

Donald Trump gets polar ice trend backwards
","President Donald Trump, who once called climate change a hoax spread by China, downplayed concerns about global temperature trends in an interview with Piers Morgan. Morgan asked Trump if he believed that climate change exists. ""There is a cooling and there is a heating and I mean, look – it used to not be climate change – it used to be global warming,"" Trump said in an interview broadcast Jan. 26. ""That wasn’t working too well, because it was getting too cold all over the place. The ice caps were going to melt, they were going to be gone by now, but now they’re setting records, so okay, they’re at a record level."" We looked at what’s been going on with the polar ice. Trump is wrong that the ice caps are at record levels. In March 2017, NASA published a news brief with the headline, ""Sea Ice Extent Sinks to Record Lows at Both Poles."" Researcher Julienne Stroeve with the National Snow and Ice Data Center said Trump’s claim was ""odd."" Stroeve said polar ice is at ""a record low in the Arctic (around the North Pole) right now and near record low in the Antarctic (around the South Pole)."" The National Snow and Ice Data Center gathers data under contracts with NASA, the National Science Foundation and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. For both the Arctic and Antarctic ice caps, the extent of the ice is down from the 30-year average. The key difference between the two polar zones is that the levels have bounced around more in Antarctica. This chart, based on National Snow and Ice Data Center numbers, shows the yearly averages back to 1979. In no way are the ice caps at record highs. Physicist Kent Moore at the University of Toronto said the satellite record going back to 1979 is well validated and reliable. For the Arctic ice certainly, but also broadly for the Antarctic too, Moore said ""there is variability from year to year but the long-term trend is downwards."" Moore did note though that some climate models are predicting a slower rate of loss than scientists have seen in the past. The White House press office pointed to a 2015 NASA report that found ice was forming in parts of Antarctica at a faster rate than it was being lost in other areas of the continent. In other words, there was a net increase in the ice mass on the continent. But a full reading of the report showed that the gains were slowing down and researchers said that in 20 to 30 years, losses would outstrip gains. We note that the study is not directly comparable to other data because it measures the ice in tons, while historically, researchers have tracked how far the ice is spread out, that is, its area, not its weight. Moore and Stroeve said the area measurements are more reliable because the observational data has been gathered over many decades. More accurate volume measurements have only recently come on line. Moore said recent work at the University of Washington suggests that even in terms of volume, the amount of polar ice has been falling. Trump said that the ice caps are at record levels. They are not. The numbers show that the extent of the ice at both poles is smaller than it was decades ago. The shrinkage is more striking in the Arctic, but the overall trend is downward at both ends of the earth. By no means are the ice caps at record high levels.

"['Immigration', 'Welfare', 'California', 'Steve Cortes']","
Are 55 percent of immigrants in California on welfare? That's an exaggeration
","Former Trump Hispanic advisory council president Steve Cortes used a questionable statistic to portray Californian immigrants as a drain on government funds. ""We have right now, and this is not my talking point, per The L.A. Times, in the state of California, 55 percent of all immigrants are on public assistance,"" Cortes said on CNN’s Erin Burnett Outfront. ""Let's start doing it right,"" Cortes continued. ""Merit based. Control the border, allow the DACA people to stay. There is a reasonable compromise here."" Cortes referred us to a Los Angeles Times op-ed, not report, entitled ""Why is liberal California the poverty capital of America?"" We tracked the statistic back to a September 2015 study from Steven Camarota at the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that favors low-immigration levels. We’ve previously rated Mostly True the claim that ""half of all immigrant households receive benefits from our social welfare system,"" also sourced back to this study. Cortes said that 55 percent of immigrants in California benefit from welfare, but the CIS report looks at immigrant households. There’s a distinction here, as immigrant households are defined as being headed by a foreign-born person. The immigrant might not always be receiving the benefit, as with households in which a U.S.-born child qualifies for a benefit, while their undocumented or newly arrived immigrant parent does not. Undocumented immigrants cannot access most services, and a 1996 law restricts immigrants from public benefits during their first five years as a ""qualified alien"". Westy Egmont, director of the Immigrant Integration Lab at Boston College, added that California’s more generous public assistance system means more people more receive aid than they would in most states. The data comes from the 2012 Survey of Income and Program Participation, the latest and most reliable source of welfare statistics according to George Borjas, an immigration expert at Harvard University. When he ran the 2017 California numbers using the Current Population Survey, he found that 41 percent of immigrant households receive public assistance, whereas 24 percent of native households do. In 2012, 49.5 percent of immigrant and 25.3 percent native households received government assistance in California. Randy Capps, director of research for U.S. programs at the Migration Policy Institute, said the report considers programs most people might not think as government assistance or welfare, including school lunches and Medicaid. School lunch is a nutrition program, and it’s not always means-tested, so some schools in low-income areas provide free or reduced lunches to all students, Capps explained. ""Medicaid is health insurance that goes with income eligibility that go way up beyond the poverty level in California,"" Capps said. ""They have workers in these families, so it’s not like it’s an alternative to work, it’s just that they have jobs that don’t carry health care benefits."" Unauthorized immigrants are not eligible for Medicaid, so Manuel Pastor, director of USC’s Center for the Study of Immigrant Integration, questioned whether American-born children using Medicaid should be lumped into the category of immigrants receiving welfare. ""That’s a key difference, because the policy alternative would be to tell U.S.-born kids who are the children of immigrants that they can’t, for example, access the CHIP program,"" Pastor said. Removing food assistance and Medicaid from the calculation shrunk the statistic significantly. Doing so showed 16.3 percent of immigrant households received cash benefits while 12.8 percent of native-born households did, and 6.1 percent of native households received public or subsidized housing, while 5.8 percent of immigrant households did. ""It would almost certainly reduce the share of households using welfare for both immigrants and natives,"" Camarota said. ""But, by how much I am not sure. Perhaps the rates would be something like 40 percent versus 20 percent."" Camarota said he measured households because the income of all persons in a household determines if one can get TANF or SNAP, and other household members benefit if they don’t have to pay for, say, a child’s health insurance. ""Examining welfare use by households is, in effect, examining welfare use for immigrants and their kids versus natives and their kids,"" Camarota said. ""The key policy question is, can immigrants support themselves and their children? High welfare use is an indication that they cannot."" The report does not correct for income, lumping in high-income native-born and immigrant households. Myungkook Joo and Jeounghee Kim took a closer look and concluded that poor immigrant families use less welfare than poor native families. Cortes said, ""We have right now … in the state of California, 55 percent of all immigrants are on public assistance."" That’s true of households but not individual immigrants, in 2012, a study found. The Current Population Survey found a lower amount, that 41 percent of immigrant households in California relied on welfare. Government assistance is broadly defined to include school lunch and Medicaid. The discrepancy in what may ordinarily be considered welfare, like cash and housing assistance, was much lower between native and immigrant households in California. In the absence of clearer definitions of public assistance and the distinction between immigrants and immigrant households, Cortes’ claim exaggerates immigrants’ drain on public coffers.

Fake story ties dead Haitian official to Clinton Foundation allegations
","A Miami Herald article about a former Haitian government official who committed suicide in July became the inspiration for fake news websites to make unsubstantiated claims tying the official to allegations about the Clinton Foundation. ""Haiti official getting ready to testify against Clinton Foundation corruption next week found dead with ‘gunshot to the head,’ "" stated a Jan. 14 headline on US Political News. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. We found that the story offers no evidence to tie the former Haitian official, Klaus Eberwein, to criticisms of the Clinton Foundation and largely repeats information from a fake news story last year.   In July, the Miami Herald reported that Eberwein, a former Haitian government official, was found dead in a South Florida motel room. Eberwein, who had worked as an Uber driver in South Florida, had fallen on hard times. Eberwein served as director general of the government’s economic development agency, Fonds d’assistance économique et social (FAES), from May 2012 until February 2015 when he was replaced. The Herald reported that Eberwein had faced allegations of fraud and corruption on how FAES administered funds. Eberwein shot himself in the head the day he was supposed to appear before the Haitian Senate’s Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission. The commission was investigating the management of PetroCaribe funds, the money Haiti receives from Venezuela’s discounted oil program. The Herald story made no mention of the Clinton Foundation or the Clintons. But a couple of days later, YourNewsWire, a website that posts fake news, made a series of inflammatory and unsubstantiated statements tying Eberwein to criticism of the Clinton Foundation. Your News Wire wrote that Eberwein was ""widely expected to testify that the Clinton Foundation misappropriated Haiti earthquake donations from international donors."" ""The Clinton Foundation, they are criminals, they are thieves, they are liars, they are a disgrace,"" YourNewsWire quoted Eberwein as saying at a Clinton Foundation protest. But the website offered no evidence that Eberwein planned to testify against the Clinton Foundation or made any such statements. US Political News used many portions of the YourNewsWire article and then added some additional information, including a clip of actual statements by another former Haitian official about the Clintons. US Political News included a video of the former Senate President of Haiti, Bernard Sansaricq, at a 2016 Donald Trump campaign event in Little Haiti in South Florida. Sansaricq criticized the record of the Clintons in Haiti. The Clintons have a long and complicated history with Haiti, but there is no evidence that Eberwein was ""getting ready to ready to testify against Clinton Foundation corruption."" He was getting ready to testify about something unrelated: money Haiti received from a Venezuela oil program. Finally, the timeline of the fake story makes no sense: Eberwein committed suicide in July 2017 while the January 2018 headline says he was getting ready to testify ""next week.""

"['Immigration', 'PunditFact', 'Ronald Brownstein']","
Did Senate pass immigration bills in 2006, 2013 and House failed to vote on them?
","In a discussion about the recent three-day government shutdown — due to lawmakers' disagreement over federal funding and policies for young immigrants in the country illegally, so-called Dreamers — pundit Ronald Brownstein said that while many Americans want Dreamers to stay, it’s unclear if that can be achieved. Twice before, senators have agreed on immigration reform, but each time, the prospect fell through without action from the U.S. House of Representatives, said Brownstein, a senior political analyst for CNN. ""They probably can find 60 votes in the Senate to do that. They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013 for immigration reform. And each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up,"" said Brownstein, who’s also senior editor at The Atlantic. ""Without the president's leverage, without him leaning on House Republicans, you could easily see the same thing again."" The Dreamers are in limbo after the Trump administration rescinded a program that prevented their deportation. President Donald Trump has tweeted that ""nobody knows for sure"" if a deal will be reached and that it must include funding for his border wall with Mexico. Is Brownstein right about the 2006 and 2013 immigration push? He’s got his history right, and we thought it was worth reviewing in depth. The Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2006 passed in the Senate on May 25, 2006, along a 62-36 vote. The bill included provisions to strengthen border security with fencing, vehicle barriers, surveillance technology and more personnel; a new temporary worker visa category; and a path to legal status for immigrants in the country illegally if they met specific criteria. Then-President George W. Bush commended the Senate ""for passing bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform"" and said he looked forward to working with both chambers. But the bill was never taken up by the House. The House in December 2005 passed a separate bill with greater focus on border security and enforcement, the Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005. That proposal narrowed in on employment eligibility verification; immigration fraud; and immigration enforcement authority at state and local levels. It did not include a guest worker program or the legalization of immigrants. Instead of voting on the Senate bill, House Republican leaders held a series of summer ""field hearings"" to get the public to weigh in on controversial provisions in the Senate bill, which Republicans labeled as amnesty. ''Our No. 1 priority is to secure the border,'' then-House Speaker Dennis Hastert, of Illinois, said in June 2006. ""And right now I haven't heard a lot of pressure to have a path to citizenship.'' In September 2006, after meeting with Republican leaders, Hastert said they agreed ""that we cannot support totally"" a lot of the provisions in the Senate bill, because it ""would not secure the border. Matter of fact, it erased the border."" Lawmakers from both chambers never formed a conference committee to iron out the details in both bills and the proposals expired at the end of the 109th Congress. Backed by Democrats and 14 Republicans, the Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act passed the Senate on a 68-32 vote on June 27, 2013. The bill directed the Secretary of Homeland Security to submit two reports on border security strategy, including one on where fencing, infrastructure and technology should be used; authorized the use of the National Guard to help secure the border; called for an increase in the number of Border Patrol agents at the southern border, and other border security measures. It also included provisions to allow immigrants in the country illegally to adjust their immigration status, if they met certain criteria. ""The bipartisan bill that passed today was a compromise … Today, the Senate did its job. It’s now up to the House to do the same,"" said then-President Barack Obama. But House Republicans again opposed the Senate immigration proposal, arguing that border security needed to be addressed first before legalizing the status of millions of immigrants. ""I’ve made it clear and I’ll make it clear again, the House does not intend to take up the Senate bill,"" then-House Speaker John Boehner said July 2013. ""The House is going to do its own job in developing an immigration bill."" He reiterated his position in November 2013: ""The idea that we’re going to take up a 1,300-page bill that no one had ever read, which is what the Senate did, is not going to happen in the House,"" Boehner said. ""And frankly, I’ll make clear we have no intention of ever going to conference on the Senate bill."" Brownstein said, ""They found 60 votes in the Senate in 2006 and 2013"" for immigration legislation, and ""each time the House Republican majority refused to take it up."" Senators did pass immigration bills in 2006 and 2013 with 62 and 68 votes, respectively. Both times, House Republicans did not address the proposals on the House floor.

Do work requirements lead to self-sufficiency?
","The Trump administration has opened the door for states to require that able-bodied Medicaid recipients work to keep their coverage. The Heartland Institute, a conservative think tank, thinks that’s a good idea. ""Work requirements are an essential tool all states should utilize,"" the institute’s Justin Haskins wrote in a Jan. 22 op-ed. ""They have been proven to help impoverished families move from dependency to self-sufficiency."" We wanted to take a closer look at Haskin’s point that making people work for benefits has been proven to help them move to self-sufficiency. Haskins told us a number of studies back him up. Most of the analysis focused on welfare reform, with some recent attention given to applying work requirements to food stamps. Teasing out the impact of the work requirement in and of itself is a complicated business, so we’ll spend most of our time looking at welfare reform, where there’s much more research. The pivotal year for making work mandatory was 1996, when Congress passed welfare reform. Welfare became a block grant program called Temporary Aid to Needy Families, or TANF, and federal cash benefits came with a lifetime limit of five years. Regarding work participation, Washington set targets for the states and gave them a measure of flexibility in defining what would qualify as work. It didn’t need to be a job. It could be community service, job training or something else. (Important for the Medicaid debate is TANF came with hefty sums to pay for child care, training and other things beyond cash benefits. The administration’s policy provides no new money for those services.) Overall, we found that work requirements weren’t the proven panacea that the op-ed suggests. Haskins highlighted several articles and studies about TANF to support his claim. The American Enterprise Institute, a market-oriented think tank, wrote in 2015 that ""the program’s robust work requirement, accountability of state performance, and expanded administrative flexibility all helped raise the labor force participation of never-married mothers from 59.5 percent in 1995 to 73.8 percent in 2001 and reduce their poverty rate from 51 percent to 38.5 percent over the same time period."" A 2012 House Republican summary, citing federal data, said ""earnings in female-headed families remained higher in 2009 than in 1996 despite various shifts in the economic climate since TANF’s enactment."" The Foundation for Government Accountability, a free-market think tank, described gains in Kansas after 2011 when then-Gov. Sam Brownback introduced a strict work requirement. Those who failed to meet it were banned from the program for periods ranging from three months to 10 years. The state also cut the lifetime limit from five years to three. ""Incomes continued to climb each year for those removed (from the rolls), eventually more than tripling — increasing by 247 percent within four years,"" the 2017 report said. ""Over that same period, these families saw an estimated $48 million increase in wages."" The report cautioned that other changes that took place at the same time meant work requirements alone couldn’t be held responsible for those improvements. Still, the authors said, ""Kansas’ new emphasis on work certainly played a large part."" Broad compilations of the many studies done since 1996 offer a more restrained assessment of the impact of work requirements. The Congressional Research Service explored a range of sanctions used to encourage financial independence in a 2014 report. It found that these measures were effective at cutting welfare rolls and produced a ""relatively modest"" rise in employment. But they fell short in making people self-sufficient. ""The earnings of welfare leavers were typically low, and employment was often not steady,"" the report said. ""Additionally, a high proportion of welfare leavers continued to receive SNAP (food stamps) after leaving cash assistance."" A study of welfare recipients in Maryland by the University of Maryland School of Social Work reported that after five years, 22 percent ended up in stable employment, while 18 percent faced unemployment. Over the decades, Washington has commissioned studies by RAND, a policy research group, where economist Lynn Karoly specializes in welfare research. Karoly told us that multiple reviews of the research revealed that work requirements ""show little effect on family income or income relative to poverty."" The problem, she explained, is that ""the increased earnings are mostly offset by the reduction in cash aid, so that families are no better off in terms of total income."" Karoly said many factors drove employment and lower welfare rolls over the years. She noted that after 1996, the economy expanded and the federal government introduced several key programs that helped the working poor, including the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Children’s Health Insurance Program. These forces, she said, drove improvements at least as much as welfare reform. One study that looked at changes between 1992 and 1999 found that a growing demand for jobs accounted for nearly half of the employment gains among welfare recipients. Work requirements accounted for less than 6 percent. A 2015 landmark analysis by University of Kentucky economist James Ziliak determined that ""the weight of research evidence seems to indicate that welfare reform reduced participation in the TANF program, increased employment and earnings, and decreased total after-tax and transfer incomes, at least in the lower half of the income distribution of single mothers."" Overall, Ziliak told us that ""there is no compelling, rigorous evidence to suggest that work requirements help families move from dependency to self-sufficiency."" A key hurdle, Ziliak said, is that even if people gain work, they still don’t make enough to get by without some form of government assistance. As the Congressional Research Service put it, ""while work or work-based benefits are usually necessary to avoid poverty, work alone is not always sufficient to do so."" Ziliak and Karoly told us that average results can be misleading. While some families might be better off, ""if anything welfare reform as a whole left those most dependent worse off financially,"" Ziliak said. They also flagged that a major problem with many studies is the failure to include non-cash benefits, such as subsidized day care and Medicaid. The Kansas researchers faced this issue. Without knowing the other government aid people continue to use, it is impossible to conclude that they have achieved self-sufficiency. We raised this issue with Haskins, and he said there’s more value to work than just the income. A person earning some money is better off than someone who isn’t. ""If you're working, however, even in a low-wage job, you're building a resume and creating more long-term economic opportunities,"" he said. The Heartland Institute said that work requirements ""have been proven to help impoverished families move from dependency to self-sufficiency."" Moving up the economic ladder is a complicated matter that hinges on the individual, the strength of the job market and a number of government policies that help make work pay. Work requirements might help in some instances, but the data also show that they leave some families worse off. The Heartland op-ed casts the policy as an unalloyed boost towards financial independence and that often is not the case. There’s an element of truth in the statement, but the research overall doesn’t back it up. The most inclusive, long-term research shows that requiring work in order to get government benefits reduces the use of benefits and increases employment. It does not, however, reliably produce enough income gains to lift people out of poverty or free them from reliance on other government assistance. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DA82C0>],/factchecks/2018/jan/26/heartland-institute/do-work-requirements-lead-self-sufficiency/

Illinois Rep. says she shares Obama’s view on gun violence
","On Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Republican governor candidate Jeanne Ives was asked a question about reducing gun violence. ""The problem is the gun violence in this city of Chicago, predominantly,"" Ives told a public forum for candidates. ""And you know how you’re going to solve it? Fathers in the home."" After reportedly being booed at the event, Ives, an Illinois state representative from Wheaton, repeated ""fathers in the home,"" according to the Chicago Tribune. The Ives campaign later doubled down on the comment, explaining in a statement released to media that ""many have advocated the same idea, including President Obama."" The Ives statement quoted from a 2008 Father’s Day speech in which then-candidate Obama, himself raised mostly by a single mother and her parents, called on fathers to own up to their family responsibilities. So is Ives seeking to further an idea that was earlier championed by Obama? Did Obama say fathers actively raising their children will solve the epidemic of gun violence in Chicago? We decided to check. Obama’s Father’s Day speech received a lot of attention, analysis and scrutiny at the time. PolitiFact rated one of the dramatic claims in the speech as True: ""More than half of all black children live in single-parent households, a number that has doubled — doubled — since we were children."" Neither Ives in her Martin Luther King Jr. Day comments nor her campaign in its follow-up explanation explicitly mentioned race in connection with the responsibilities of fathers. In fact, the campaign statement sought to draw a link between her assertions and those of Obama by directly quoting from his 2008 Father’s Day speech, yet omitted passages that specifically discussed African-American families. One Obama quote cited by the Ives campaign expressed concern about the absence of too many fathers from homes and families: ""We know the statistics — that children who grow up without a father are five times more likely to live in poverty and commit crime; nine times more likely to drop out of schools and 20 times more likely to end up in prison."" Peniel Joseph, founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the University of Texas, said Ives was off the mark in trying to link Obama’s sentiments to her take on solving gun violence. Joseph, also a professor at Texas’ LBJ School of Public Affairs, said he knows Obama’s Father’s Day speech well and the soon-to-be-president ""never connected that (speech) specifically to ending gun violence. It was more of an observation on black families."" Obama did cite crime as one of the outcomes of broken homes, but Joseph said gun violence can be linked to a broad range of factors. ""It’s connected to the drug trade, unemployment, segregated schools,"" he added. Joseph said he could not recall a time when Obama, in that speech or others, said fathers staying home with their families will reduce gun violence. During his presidency, Obama made several major speeches about gun violence. In a 2013 report, released weeks after a school massacre that killed 20 youngsters in Newtown, Connecticut, Obama proposed a multi-pronged approach to addressing the issue — including improved background checks and other ways to strengthen restrictions on criminals buying guns. Not listed among Obama’s solutions was an emphasis on more two-parent families. April Zeoli, a gun violence expert at Michigan State University, disputed Ives’ prescription for curbing gun violence. ""I haven’t seen this as a real, viable intervention for gun violence in Chicago,"" said Zeoli, an associate professor of criminal justice. In the Ives campaign statement, the candidate also stressed that Obama was just one of ""many"" others who had drawn a link between absentee fathers and gun violence. She did not name other names than Obama’s, however. When we asked her campaign to elaborate, it provided a list of advocacy organizations such as The National Fatherhood Initiative, The National Center for Fathering and The Fatherhood Project. Also on the list provided by the Ives campaign was disgraced comedian Bill Cosby, who is facing retrial in Pennsylvania on charges that he drugged and sexually assaulted a woman. Ives claims she was echoing comments from former President Obama as she declared recently that the solution to curbing rampant gun violence would depend on more fathers taking responsibility for their families. In his 2008 speech, Obama drew a link between children from fatherless homes and those who stray into crime. But Ives took it a lot further than Obama ever did. Her sweeping claim is not supported by the passages from Obama’s speech that her campaign pointed to as evidence. A reading of the full speech doesn’t support Ives either. As president, Obama made several speeches about the proliferation of guns and violence, and also laid out an array of proposals to deal with the problems. In his public pronouncements, however, Obama did not make statements linking the problem of absent fathers with gun violence. Ives is taking the message from Obama’s 2008 Father’s Day speech out of context.

Checking Gov. Walker's claim that state DOT is ahead of the game
","Given the perpetual orange barrels and accompanying traffic delays on Milwaukee area highways, drivers could be forgiven if they pounded the steering wheel after a recent tweet from Gov. Scott Walker. ""Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation,"" the governor tweeted Dec. 18, 2017. Responses from the Twitterverse showed not everyone was in the same lane: ""Apparently the 94/45 interchange isn’t part of the state."" ""#WI: worst roads between the Rockies and Atlantic Ocean"" ""When is that zoo interchange supposed to be done again? 2018? 2019? 2020? . . . and counting."" Let’s give this one a spin. Walker’s evidence Walker communications director Tom Evenson noted the governor’s tweet directly followed the announcement that the State Highway 441 project in the Fox Valley will be finishing in 2019, a year ahead of the previous expected date. ""By combining projects on the WIS 441 project into a larger package for construction to bid, WisDOT anticipates more competitive bids, greater contractor efficiencies during construction and estimated saving of $9 million in project costs,"" Evenson said in an email. In addition, Evenson said, in April 2017, the governor announced that the Transportation Department freed up more than $100 million for additional projects to be advanced. This was a result, he said, of $65 million in savings over the course of the state fiscal year – due to lower gas prices and more competitive bids -- and an additional $38 million in available revenues to add to the Transportation Fund’s FY18 opening balance. Rebecca Kikkert, director of the Wisconsin Department of Transportation Office of Public Affairs,  pointed PolitiFact Wisconsin to an April 13, 2017, state DOT announcement of the $38 million savings. ""With let savings, WisDOT is able to do additional projects and move scheduled projects ahead advancing them, which enables the completion date for these projects to move ahead and get completed sooner,"" Kikkert said in an email. Putting on the brakes Craig Thompson, executive director of the Transportation Development Association of Wisconsin, a Madison-based group with a primary mission of outreach to the public, media, and decision-makers about the importance of an integrated transportation network, didn’t disagree with the evidence the Walker administration provided. However, Thompson cited a list of delayed projects, with several major ones among them: I-94 North-South between Kenosha and the Mitchell Interchange. Original scheduled completion: 2016. The completion date if the state receives an applied-for $246 million federal grant: 2021. The completion date without the federal grant: 2032. The state is still waiting to hear whether it will receive all, some or none of its request. I-94 East-West. The safety and congestion problems that prompted state transportation officials to plan the reconstruction and widening of I-94 between 16th and 70th streets in Milwaukee will not be dealt with now that the project has been abandoned. I-43 North-South (Silver Spring Drive. to Wis. 60), Glendale to Grafton - Milwaukee and Ozaukee counties. ""This project has been put on hold until further notice,"" according to an October 2015 announcement on the Wisconsin Department of Transportation website. I-94 between U.S. Highway 12 and State Highway 65 (St. Croix County). Work on the federally-designated truck route between the Twin Cities and St. Croix County was included in the 2017-'19 budget by lawmakers, but vetoed by Walker. To be sure, Walker’s team highlighted cases where -- once contracts have been issued -- work was completed earlier than expected, while Thompson noted delayed by broader funding issues. That said, Walker’s tweet did not make such a distinction clear. It was a broad claim. And -- as many of the Twitter responses indicated --  that’s how many people understood it. Ex-DOT secretary waved caution flag Then-DOT Secretary Mark Gottlieb told state lawmakers at a December 2016 hearing that the conditions of Wisconsin’s highways would worsen if funding trends continue. Under Walker’s budget at the time, 21 percent of Wisconsin’s highway system was projected to be in poor condition by 2018, he said. By 2027, that number would grow to 42 percent. Gottlieb had at times called for increasing taxes and fees to pay for highways. Walker has said he won’t raise gas taxes or vehicle fees unless an equivalent cut is made in other taxes. Gottlieb stepped down less than a month after he told lawmakers Wisconsin’s roads would worsen under Walker's plans. In September 2017, Walker signed the two-year, $76 billion budget. It borrows $402 million for transportation infrastructure, far less than included in recent budgets. The plan delays work on Highway 15 in Outagamie County and the north leg of the Zoo Interchange in Milwaukee County and puts off the reconstruction of I-94 between the Zoo and Marquette interchanges. The reduction in funding for interstates in southeast Wisconsin did a U-turn with the announcement of Foxconn locating in southeast Wisconsin. The state is pinning its hopes for the expanded freeway and related work on a $246.2 million federal grant from the U.S. Department of Transportation that would pay for about half the remaining cost. Our rating In a tweet, Walker said ""Road projects across the state are staying on track or getting done sooner thanks to the good work of the team at the Wisconsin Department of Transportation."" A spokesman said Walker was referring to the early completion of the State Highway 441 project. But that was not specified in the tweet, and a wide range of other projects -- including major ones -- have been delayed. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809720C780>],/factchecks/2018/jan/26/scott-walker/checking-gov-walkers-claim-state-dot-ahead-game/
"['Criminal Justice', 'State Budget', 'California', 'Jerry Brown']","
Has the rate of California’s prison spending nearly tripled since 1970?
","Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown reeled off statistics on California’s prison spending during his final State of the State Address after a total of 16 years as governor. Brown, who has followed a federal court order to reduce the state’s prison overcrowding, warned legislators at the state Capitol not to simply pass more crime laws but instead consider a holistic approach to criminal justice. He suggested California has gone too far on prison spending since 1970. ""The corrections budget then was about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it’s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion,"" Brown said. Was the governor right? Has California’s prison spending nearly tripled as a share of the state’s general fund budget since 1970? We set out on a fact check. Our research California’s 1970-71 fiscal year budget, produced under then Gov. Ronald Reagan, backs up the first part of Brown’s claim. It lists the corrections department as 2.8 percent, or nearly $40 million, of the state’s $1.4 billion general fund budget that year. California's 1970-71 fiscal year budget. Brown’s 2018-19 budget proposal, meanwhile, also supports the claim. It shows the state expects to spend 9 percent, or nearly $12 billion, of its $132 billion general fund on the corrections department. That’s up about $1 billion from prison spending two years ago. Franklin Zimring, a UC Berkeley criminal justice professor, called Brown’s claim about the increased share of prison spending ""absolutely true."" ""California’s prison population exploded from 1980 through the late 1990s and prison building metastasized in the state,"" Zimring said. ""We went from a little over 24,000 prisoners in California prisons to over 170,000 prisoners in 2010 and 2011."" Zimring attributed the increase to the state’s booming population during that period, tough sentencing laws, particularly 1994’s Three Strikes law, and the national focus on drug crimes. Fewer inmates, higher costs California has sharply cut its prison population following a 2009 U.S. Supreme Court order for California to reduce prison overcrowding. The population reached a peak of 163,000 inmates in 2006, according to the Public Policy Institute of California. The state estimates it will house an average of about 119,000 prisoners this year. But as the inmate numbers have dropped, state corrections spending has continued to rise. That’s, in part, because California has the highest per capita inmate cost in the nation, at an estimated $80,000 annually for 2018-19, as we examined in a recent fact check. There’s been no corresponding reduction in prison staff as inmate numbers have fallen, causing per capita costs to spike. At the same time, prison staffing costs have increased. Jeffrey Callison, a state prisons spokesman, told us the conditions of the court order prevent California from closing prisons even as the inmate population is reduced. ""So long as the order is in effect we cannot close prisons because to do so would reduce our capacity, thereby pushing us back above 137.5 percent"" level of prison crowding, Callison said in an email. That level is tied to prison capacity and defined by the court, he said. Our ruling Gov. Jerry Brown recently claimed California’s corrections budget in 1970 was ""about 3 percent of the general fund. Now, it’s 8.9 percent, about $12 billion."" California’s 1970-71 fiscal year budget supports the first part of Brown’s claim, listing prison system spending as 2.8 percent of that year’s general fund. Brown’s budget proposal for this fiscal year, meanwhile, shows the corrections department is now estimated to be 9 percent of the general fund, or $12 billion. A UC Berkeley criminal justice professor told us the governor’s spending claim rings true, noting the state’s prison population exploded during the 1980s and 1990s, driven by the state’s overall population boom, strict criminal sentencing laws and a national focus on drug crimes.   The governor’s numbers are on the mark and there’s nothing significant missing from his statement.

Is California No. 1 in solar power and solar jobs?
","Sen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., wasn’t happy about President Donald Trump authorizing tariffs on solar energy cells and panels. ""No state generates as much solar power as California, or has as many people whose jobs depend on it. This is an attack on California,"" Harris tweeted Jan. 24, two days after Trump signed the order. No state generates as much solar power as California, or has as many people whose jobs depend on it. This is an attack on California. https://t.co/O9qK3zo4IS We wondered whether Harris was correct about how California ranks in U.S. solar power generation. First, a word about the tariffs. They will start at 30 percent and then fall over a four-year period to 15 percent, with some exceptions. The biggest expected loser will be China, which has become the world’s largest supplier of solar equipment. The U.S. solar industry has been divided on the tariffs. Two companies — Suniva Inc. and SolarWorld Americas — pushed for them, though many end users of solar equipment and solar energy expressed concern about the impact on consumer prices. The most complete state-by-state data on solar power comes from the Solar Energy Industries Association, the industry’s trade group. The group’s data shows that California ranked first among states nationally in installed solar capacity in 2016 with 18,296 megawatts. California ranks far ahead on this score. The next-closest state is North Carolina, with less than one-sixth the amount of installed solar capacity. The other states in the top 10 are, in order, Arizona, Nevada, New Jersey, Utah, Massachusetts, Georgia, Texas and New York. As for jobs, California also ranks No. 1, with 100,050 positions tallied by the group. The second-ranking state in solar jobs is Massachusetts with 14,582 —only about one-sixth as many as California. That isn’t entirely surprising: California is the nation’s most populous state and third-biggest by land area behind Alaska and Texas. It also tends to get a lot of sun. On a per capita basis, the group’s data shows California ranks fourth in solar capacity behind Nevada, Utah and Hawaii. It also ranks fourth in solar jobs per capita, behind Massachusetts, Nevada and Vermont. That said, there’s little question that California has actively encouraged solar energy in recent years due to state policy efforts and consumer preferences. Our ruling Harris said, ""No state generates as much solar power as California, or has as many people whose jobs depend on it."" The raw numbers back her up, it’s worth noting that the state’s size is a factor. On a per capita basis, California ranks fourth in both solar capacity and solar-related jobs.

"['Education', 'Texas', 'Andrew White']","
Andrew White behind the times in saying Texas ranks 43rd for its schools; it's in 40th place lately
","Andrew White, the Houston investor among Democratic aspirants hoping to deny Greg Abbott a second term as governor, says the state’s public schools rank poorly. White specified at his December 2017 campaign kickoff: ""For schools, we’re 43rd in the nation. Let me say that again. We’re 43rd in the nation. How can we claim that we’re preparing our kids for tomorrow when we can barely prepare them for yesterday?"" It’s not unusual for a candidate to suggest schools need a lift. For instance, Abbott, a Republican, promised on his way to winning the state’s top elected post to make Texas ""No. 1 in the nation for educating our children."" It’s also worth noting there are varied ways of comparing schools. For instance, US News rankings, drawing in part on student scores on national math and reading exams, place Texas’ public schools 41st--though the state's high school graduation rate ranked fifth. So White, who continued to cite the state’s No. 43 ranking into 2018, made us wonder. White spokeswoman Desi Canela, asked how White reached the declared ranking, pointed out news accounts quoting a study released toward the end of 2015 by Education Week, a national publication that reports on education from kindergarten through high school. The stories, posted in January 2016 by Houston Public Media, the San Antonio Express-News and the El Paso Times, each headlined the No. 43 ranking bestowed based on dozens of indicators across the categories of school funding, student achievement and future student success. A correction and more recent rankings When we turned to verify the No. 43 ranking, we learned that the cited study was amended a few weeks after publication to correct errors in its initial school finance section. As a result, Texas schools edged up to rank 41st among the states (42nd if you count the District of Columbia). Also, we noticed, more recent Education Week studies, released in December 2016 and January 2018, respectively, show Texas schools ranking 40th among the states (41st if you count D.C.). To our inquiry, Sterling Lloyd of the Education Week Research Center summed up by email: ""In the 2016 report, Texas received an overall grade of C-minus and a score of 69.7. In 2017, it earned a C-minus (70.2). For the 2018 grading, it got a C-minus (70.6). ""So, the slight improvement in ranking between 2016 and the subsequent years reflects a modest gain in the state’s numerical score if not its letter grade. This change was driven by an improvement in Texas’ School Finance score, where it gained about a point between 2016 and 2017 and about a point between 2017 and 2018. The improvement for Texas in the School Finance score reflects gains on equity in the distribution of funding across districts within the state. For instance, the gap between the highest- and lowest-spending districts in Texas narrowed from 2016 to 2017 and from 2017 to 2018."" Why Texas placed 40th White couldn’t have had the latest rankings when he announced his candidacy. So to learn more about Texas’ ranking, we focused on the second-to-latest breakdown. The publication’s web page presenting those state-by-state rankings, dated Dec. 30, 2016, shows Texas’s C-minus score of 70.2 trailing both No. 1 Massachusetts, with a B-grade score of 86.5, and the national C-grade average of 74.2. States with worse-than-Texas rankings included California, New Mexico, Oklahoma and, in last place, Nevada with a D-grade score of 65, the page shows. Texas got its C-minus based on the following Education Week-bestowed grades:              SOURCE: Web page,  ""Quality Counts 2017: State Report Cards Map,"" Education Week, Dec. 30, 2016 A separate web post elaborates on how Texas fared, specifying that the state ranked 24th among the states and D.C. for its ""K-12 Achievement Index,"" which takes into account 18 indicators; 39th in the ""Chance-for-Success"" category, which considers 13 indicators; and 44th for ""School Finance."" Other takes We looked next for perspective outside of Education Week. Houston Public Media’s story quoted the Texas Education Agency saying: ""It’s difficult to effectively evaluate the state’s performance from a national report where no state made the highest"" possible ""grade, no state made the lowest grade and the majority of states were all lumped into the same grade category."" When we followed up, the agency’s Lauren Callahan reaffirmed the quoted statement and also said by email that the agency doesn’t comment on rankings ""since each utilizes a different methodology in determining a final grade."" Callahan noted too that the agency has been assigned by law to implement a system giving A-to-F grades to campuses and districts. ""Specifics of that system will be in place later this year,"" Callahan said. We also asked Children At Risk, a Houston-based nonprofit that appraises schools, what it makes of White’s cited rankings. Andy Canales replied by email that the group, which has worked with Education Week,  considers the publication’s reports ranking the schools in each state to be sound studies ""in line with research by Children At Risk."" Holly Eaton of the Texas Classroom Teachers Association, which was among education advocacy groups that we asked to weigh in, pointed out that Texas spends less per student than many states. Generally, Eaton said by email, rankings can oversimplify. Notably, she said, the Education Week studies don’t adjust test results that figure into its grades to account for demographic differences. Once that’s done on results on the National Assessment of Educational Progress, Eaton noted, Texas surges close to having the nation’s best student performance results, according to research by the Urban Institute focused on 2013 and 2015 NAEP scores. By email, Lloyd agreed that it’s important to consider demographics when thinking about a state’s academic performance. But Education Week, he said, tries ""to make our methodology for the grading as straightforward as possible. Adjusting for demographics can make the grading less straightforward for the public. It adds methodological details that need to be evaluated."" Eaton later commented that Land’s response ""illustrates the classic tension in performance reporting between the desire for clarity (thus oversimplification) vs accuracy (thus complexity)."" We shared with Canela the fact that Texas schools lately rank 40th in the rankings and didn’t draw additional comment. Our ruling White has said Texas schools rank ""43rd in the nation."" In fact, Texas schools ranked 40th among the states heading into 2017, according to the latest Education Week rankings that were public before White spoke. We rate his statement Mostly True.

Dan Patrick airs unsupported claim about 566,000 'crimes made' by 'criminal aliens' in recent years
","Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, seeking re-election, entered 2018 by warning on his campaign’s Facebook page that ""criminal aliens"" committed more than 500,000 Texas crimes in recent years. We wondered about Patrick’s declaration in part because we’d just found scant data about Texas crimes committed by individuals living illegally in the United States. Also, research rooted in U.S. Census Bureau data suggests that nationally, unauthorized immigrants commit few crimes. For that other fact-check, we calculated from annual state-posted crime reports that the 170,000 arrests of ""criminal immigrants"" proclaimed by a Texas House member at a 2015 hearing represented about 4 percent of all the adult arrests in the state from 2011 through 2015. But absent expert analysis, we wouldn't brandish that percentage as a fact. Here’s Patrick’s statement on Facebook, which he presented against the backdrop of a wire fence: ""566,000 crimes made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years."" We took that to mean that ""criminal aliens"" were found guilty of 566,000 crimes over six years. Then again, text in smaller print to the right of Patrick’s fence-backdropped statement offers a different interpretation. That text says: ""In the past six years, criminal aliens have been charged with more than 566,000 crimes in Texas including kidnapping, homicide, burglary, and much more. There is no excuse for endangering our communities by allowing criminal aliens who have committed a crime to go free."" Some perspective: We estimate, starting from Texas Department of Public Safety annual crime reports for 2011 through 2016, that there were 5,513,663 adult criminal arrests in the state in the six-plus years referenced by Patrick. If the 566,000 figure offered by Patrick solely reflects arrests, he was referring to about 10 percent of adult arrests in the state. Patrick points to state-posted figures We asked Patrick, a Houston Republican who touts his support for a secure U.S.-Mexico border in a fresh video ad, about the basis of his 566,000 ""crimes made"" statement. A spokesman, Alejandro Garcia, replied by email: ""We have answered this question many times."" Garcia provided a link to a familiar DPS web page, ""Historical Arrest and Conviction Data for Select Offenses Associated with Criminal Aliens:""              SOURCE: Web page, ""Historical Arrest and Conviction Data for Select Offenses Associated with Criminal Aliens,"" Texas Department of Public Safety, undated (accessed Jan. 23, 2018) Adding up the chart’s tallied arrests, covering 11 crime categories, gets you to 638,411 arrests ""associated with criminal aliens."" And did all those arrests occur in the six-plus years noted by Patrick on Facebook? Not so. A related DPS web page noted by Garcia, ""Texas Criminal Alien Arrest Data,"" says that according to Department of Homeland Security ""status indicators, over 240,000 criminal aliens have been booked into local Texas jails between June 1, 2011 and December 31, 2017. During their criminal careers,"" it says, ""these criminal aliens were charged with more than 638,000 criminal offenses."" We read ""criminal careers"" to refer to the booked individuals’ lifetime rap sheets. More from the DPS page about those ""career"" arrests: ""Those arrests include 1,300 homicide charges; 76,044 assault charges; 18,126 burglary charges; 76,660 drug charges; 774 kidnapping charges; 43,591 theft charges; 49,154 obstructing police charges; 4,180 robbery charges; 6,878 sexual assault charges; and 9,561 weapon charges."" Unmentioned in that text: 352,143 of all the tallied arrests, 55 percent, were for ""all other offenses,"" according to the DPS. According to DPS criminal history records, the agency says, those 638,000-plus criminal charges ""have thus far resulted in over 286,000 convictions."" The conviction count presented on the chart offered as Patrick’s backup indicates 286,101 convictions. The DPS page says the convictions break out to 547 homicide convictions; 28,592 assault convictions; 8,915 burglary convictions; 37,581 drug convictions; 268 kidnapping convictions; 19,803 theft convictions; 24,084 obstructing police convictions; 2,153 robbery convictions; 3,164 sexual assault convictions; and 3,973 weapon convictions."" Its text on the web page doesn’t mention the 157,021 included convictions for other offenses accounting for 55 percent of the total convictions. We spotted a couple other wrinkles. DPS’s web page indirectly reminds that a ""criminal alien"" isn’t necessarily someone living in the country without documentation. ""Of the total criminal aliens arrested in that timeframe,"" the page says, ""over 160,000 or 66% were identified by DHS status as being in the U.S. illegally at the time of their last arrest."" We noticed too that the DPS doesn’t specify how many of the noted arrests or convictions through criminal careers tie to the 160,000-plus people believed to be living here illegally at the time of their latest arrest. Our requests to the DPS to corroborate Patrick’s 566,000 figure didn’t yield additional information. Our ruling Patrick said that ""566,000 crimes"" were ""made in Texas by criminal aliens in the last 6 years."" We didn't find a factual path to this figure and, in fact, spotted no state-posted information specifying a relevant count of criminal arrests or convictions for the six-plus years singled out by Patrick. The DPS has said that more than 638,000 charges and over 286,000 convictions were accumulated through their ""criminal careers"" by more than 240,000 ""criminal aliens"" booked into Texas jails in the six-plus years. Unsaid: Some of those people were living in the U.S. with legal authorization. We find Patrick’s statement inaccurate and ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

"['Israel', 'Florida', 'Ron DeSantis']","
DeSantis wrong about UN resolutions against Israel
","Rep. Ron DeSantis, R-Fla., went head-to-head with an audience member after he criticized the United Nations’ treatment of Israel in the final year of Barack Obama’s presidency. ""I don't know really what they do other than attack Israel,"" DeSantis said during a Jan. 11 event at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative organization. ""In that year, they did 24 resolutions, and 20 of them were against Israel."" An unnamed person in the audience objected to that point after the speech, saying it ""was very disgraceful and sad that you said something as an elected official that's blatantly not true."" The man offered another statistic for anti-Israel resolutions and told DeSantis to ""double-check your facts."" ""I will. This stuff been widely reported,"" DeSantis said. ""I don’t think it’s much up for dispute."" PolitiFact Florida wanted to see about that.  DeSantis was referring to a more narrow count of resolutions from the U.N. General Assembly, and not the U.N. system. That’s important to know, because the United Nations adopted hundreds of resolutions in 2016 — not just 24. Any United Nations body can issue a resolution, which is a formal text or statement. But the most resolutions are issued by the Security Council or the General Assembly. The 15-member Security Council is the only body of the U.N. that can pass binding resolutions, which member states are required to implement under the U.N. Charter. The council can pass economic sanctions and launch investigations and peacekeeping missions.  For example, the Security Council adopted resolution 2397 in December 2017 in response to Pyongyang's Nov. 29 ballistic missile test. It established sanctions against North Korea that restricted fuel imports as well as the ability of its citizens to work abroad. Then there’s the U.N. General Assembly, comprised of all 193 member states. Unlike the Security Council, General Assembly resolutions are non-binding and do not carry any legal force on member states.  Some resolutions take public policy stances on serious issues and conflicts, while others are less significant. Resolution 71/124 desiginated May 2 as World Tuna Day. Resolution 71/4 appointed Mr. António Guterres as U.N. secretary-general. DeSantis spokeswoman Elizabeth Fusick said he was referring to resolutions passed during the 71st session of the U.N. General Assembly from September 2016 to September 2017. But the Assembly adopted about 330 resolutions during that time. So where is DeSantis getting his information? Fusick pointed to an analysis by UN Watch, a pro-Israel watchdog group that monitors criticism by the United Nations of the Jewish state. UN Watch’s analysis does not pertain to all of 2016, however. It only looks at resolutions passed in the last two months of 2016. In that timeframe, the UN Watch analysis showed the General Assembly adopted 20 resolutions that ""singled out"" Israel. In contrast, only four other resolutions were adopted condemning other nations: one each against Ukraine and Iran, and two about Syria. In a subsequent December 2016 story, UN Watch added two more resolutions against Syria and North Korea. The General Assembly resolutions against Israel are largely symbolic. Elliott Abrams, senior fellow for Middle Eastern studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, noted that a 2017 General Assembly vote against Israel was followed by no concrete steps in an issue brief. So why adopt them at all? Michael Koplow, Israel Policy Forum's policy director, said the resolutions are an easy way for Arab and Muslim states to indicate their opposition to Israel and also single out the United States. Whether the specific resolutions that are critical of Israel are justified is not something we will evaluate in this fact-check However, we will note that there are conflicting opinions on whether some of those resolutions should count as ""anti-Israel."" Koplow pointed to UN Watch's inclusion of resolution 71/126, which he said does not ""single-out"" Israel. Instead it welcomes humanitarian assistance and economic aid for Gaza, and reiterates multiple times the need for the Palestinian Authority to be in charge of implementing development projects rather than Hamas. The situation is reversed for resolutions passed by the powerful Security Council. Mainstream news reports in December 2016 did mention the Security Council’s resolution 2334, which condemned Jewish settlements in the Palestinian territories as ""constituting a flagrant violation under international law."" The vote was significant, because the United States abstained from the vote. For this reason, the U.N. Security Council was able to adopt the resolution — which usually doesn't happen. ""Israel is shielded from critical resolutions for the most part, because of the United States,"" said Louis Charbonneau, the director of the United Nations program at Human Rights Watch. A single vote from one permanent member on the Security Council can veto a resolution. Charbonneau said the United States has a history of vetoing resolutions that are critical of Israel, especially under the Trump administration. For example, in December 2017 the United States blocked a Security Council vote on a resolution that directed all states to stop building diplomatic missions in Jerusalem. This point explains the audience member’s issue with DeSantis. After calling DeSantis out for lying, the audience member said that the U.N. adopted 76 resolutions, and only one was related to Israel in 2016. He was referring to the number of resolutions passed by the Security Council in 2016. DeSantis said the United Nations spent one year doing ""24 resolutions, and 20 of them were against Israel."" These numbers are wrong. The United Nations' General Assembly passed hundreds of resolutions in the year-long 2016-17 session — not two dozen. DeSantis was apparently trying to repeat a watchdog group's findings that 20 of 24 (and then 26) General Assembly resolutions against other countries, over a few months in 2016, were against Israel. But his sweeping public comment contained no trace of those clarifications, and he doubled down on his statement at the event. His effort to boil down a complex system into a sound bite doesn't check out.

No, California didn’t pass a law allowing undocumented immigrants to register to vote
","In April 2018, a new law will allow Californians to automatically register to vote when they renew their driver’s license. It’s intended to bolster registration in a state where voter turnout has lagged. A slew of conservative websites, however, have seized on the law, dubbed the California New Motor Voter Program, to make the claim this week that it will register undocumented immigrants to vote. They cite a separate law, AB 60, that allows undocumented Californians to apply for and obtain a state driver’s license, as alleged proof. This World Net Daily headline on Jan. 21, 2018 sparked the recent claims: ""California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote – Automatically.""  Shortly after it was published, similar allegations were made by The New American, FoxNews.com and conservative commentators Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh. This isn’t the first wave of commentary on the topic. Similar statements were made when California passed the Motor Voter program in 2015. But because the claims popped up again this week, it’s time to take another look at the California laws in question and the safeguards state officials say are in place. We’ll also place a rating on the claim by World Net Daily. Background on the laws Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown signed AB 60 in 2013, making California the 10th state to allow driver licenses for people in the country illegally. The goal was to increase public safety and reduce penalties for undocumented immigrants who drive. As of June 2017, the state Department of Motor Vehicles had issued more than 900,000 of the licenses. In 2015, Brown signed the New Motor Voter law. By April, it will automatically register DMV customers to vote when they renew or obtain a driver’s license or fill out change of address forms, unless the customer opts-out. Under the law, the DMV would electronically send information for those eligible to register to vote -- which does not include undocumented residents -- to the California Secretary of State’s Office. That office would, in turn, verify name and citizenship information. A spokesman for that office did not respond to requests for comment this week. In the past, however, Secretary of State Alex Padilla has pledged the new system will be an improvement over the existing one. ""Automated voter registration is actually a more secure way of doing things,"" Padilla told the Huffington Post in 2015. Potential voters ""have to demonstrate proof of age, the vast majority of time people are showing a birth certificate or a passport, which also reflects citizenship. That’s arguably more secure than someone checking a box under penalty of perjury."" ""Completely inaccurate"" claims Jessica Gonzalez, spokeswoman with the California DMV, said she’s contacted several of the websites making what she called ""completely inaccurate"" claims and asked for corrections. One, the Daily Mail, had pulled down its story, another updated its article, while she said Fox News did not immediately correct its article. ""Undocumented Californians are not eligible to register to vote at the DMV,"" Gonzalez told PolitiFact California. ""And we have programming measures in place to prevent that from occurring."" At DMV field offices, Gonzalez said, technicians will not be able to key in any voting information for undocumented customers seeking AB 60 license renewals. As soon as a technician types in AB 60, the voter information section automatically gets ""greyed out"" and can’t be typed into and can’t be bypassed, the spokeswoman said. She added that the same safeguards are in place for online and mail renewals. ""The (mail) form won’t even have the voter information questions on it, so they won’t be able to register to vote,"" Gonzalez said. ""It’s really interesting how quickly false information spreads,"" she continued, ""and how difficult it is to get the correct information out there to Californians that really need to know this information."" A representative for World Net Daily could not be reached for comment. Several fact-checking websites, from Snopes.com to The Weekly Standard, a conservative publication, examined the topic this week. The Weekly Standard concluded ""there is zero evidence to support that ludicrous claim."" Our ruling Conservative news websites and commentators claimed California plans to register undocumented immigrants to vote. This isn’t the first time such unsubstantiated claims have been made. But the recent spat was sparked by the World Net Daily headline: ""California To Register Illegal Aliens To Vote – Automatically."" In reality, the California law that goes into effect in April 2018 will automatically register only those eligible to vote when they renew or obtain a driver’s license. Undocumented immigrants are excluded. The law does nothing to change the federal requirement that one must be a U.S. citizen to register to vote. State officials said safeguards are already in place to prevent state DMV workers from typing in any voter information for AB 60 license holders. The state allows unauthorized immigrants to obtain a driver’s license, but explicitly excludes that group from the automatic voter registration. The allegations on this topic are recycled. And they’re still blatantly untrue. We rate World Net Daily’s claim Pants On Fire. PANTS ON FIRE – The statement is not accurate and makes a ridiculous claim. UPDATE: After we published our fact check, World Net Daily published a separate  article saying a spokeswoman for the California Department of Motor Vehicles ""cleared up an inaccuracy in WND’s initial report."" It said the spokeswoman explained that California’s licenses for undocumented immigrants ""are not eligible for the new voter registration system."" As of Jan. 29, 2018, World Net Daily had not updated its original report with this information.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B1A500>],/factchecks/2018/jan/24/worldnetdaily/no-california-didnt-pass-law-allowing-undocumented/

Headline says Mueller-Pelosi affair is 'steamy,' but it's fake news
","A story on Facebook says that House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and former FBI director Robert Mueller are having a ""steamy, 13-year affair,"" but the story is fake news. ""Mueller will be forced to resign over Pelosi affair,"" stated a Jan. 18 headline by The Patriot Report. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The story has no evidence and is fake news. The story attributes the information to Ladies of Liberty, a website that describes itself as satire. Mueller was appointed by the Justice Department as special counsel to investigate connections between President Donald Trump’s 2016 campaign and Russia. In May, Pelosi supported Mueller’s appointment as a ""first step"" but in October called for an ""outside, fully independent investigation."" The Patriot Report said that Pelosi and Mueller had a 13-year affair that will force Mueller to resign, but Pelosi will hold her California congressional seat until she dies. The story said that Pelosi said her husband was aware of the affair and that her ""husband was afforded the same freedom to explore 'pleasures of the flesh.' "" Pelosi has never made any such comment. Fictional affairs are common fodder on fake news websites. We previously debunked fake articles claiming that U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat, had an affair with former FBI Director James Comey, and that U.S. Sen. Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, had an affair with a cheerleader.

Fake story says elderly man shot Muslims in self defense
","A story moving on Facebook would lead you to believe that an elderly California man was sentenced to death after defending himself when he was ambushed by two Muslim men, but the story is fake news. ""82-year-old who killed a Muslim in self-defense gets the death penalty,"" said a Jan. 15 headline on The Patriot Report. The story was previously posted by Ladies of Liberty, a website that defines itself as satire. Facebook users flagged the post as being potentially fabricated, as part of the social network’s efforts to combat fake news. The fake story has several made up details including that the photo of the elderly man reportedly sentenced to death in California is actually of a drug trafficker caught in Kansas. The story said that in October 2015 William DeLisle of Marina Del Ray, Calif., was walking home from the local senior center when he was ambushed by a pair of young Muslims -- Abdi Nadjeer Hallalla and Mustif Salabu. DeLisle, a Marine veteran, pulled a .22 from his ankle holster and shot both men within seconds, leaving one dead and the other paralyzed. The story said that the ""Dewey County Prosecutor"" said that because the two men were unarmed, the use of deadly force was ""extreme and unnecessary."" We found no such Dewey County in California, although the county does exist in Oklahoma and South Dakota. The photo allegedly of DeLisle matches a photo of Marshall Dion taken in Junction City, Kan., when he was arrested on drug trafficking charges in 2013. Dion had a long, colorful history with law enforcement dating back to 1985 when he crashed an airplane in Wisconsin and crawled away, denying that $112,000 found inside and around the airplane belonged to him. In that incident, the government confiscated the money, suspecting it was drug money, but he wasn’t charged. We searched the names of the alleged suspects in Nexis and found nothing in news accounts. We found nothing about an elderly William DeLisle in California, however, there was a 19th century British pulp-fiction writer by that name who in one book wrote about whites killing all blacks and Asians to create a paradise. Fake news purveyors have published many false stories that cast Muslims in a negative light, including one about 412 Muslims arrested in a Michigan bust and another story claiming a Muslim man started a California wildfire. In this case, the headline that an ""82-year-old who killed a Muslim in self-defense gets the death penalty"" is also fake news.

Donald Trump’s unsubstantiated claims about chain migration, NYC terror suspect
","President Donald Trump has repeatedly claimed that more than 20 people have migrated to the United States due to family ties to a terror attack suspect. A man drove a truck onto a bike lane and pedestrian walkway in Manhattan on Oct. 31, killing eight people and injuring 12 others. The suspect, Sayfullo Habibullaevic Saipov, is an Uzbek national whom Trump has singled out as a reason why ""chain migration"" and a visa lottery program should end. ""This man that came in — or whatever you want to call him — brought in, with him, other people … He was the point of contact — the primary point of contact for — and this is preliminarily — 23 people that came in, or potentially came in with him. And that’s not acceptable. So we want to get rid of chain migration, and we’ve wanted to do that for a long time,"" Trump said Nov. 1. Trump offered a lower number as he discussed the terror suspect with the Wall Street Journal on Jan. 11: ""So the lottery has to end, chain migration — he brought in, they say, 22 people through the chain. So we have 22 of his relatives, why?"" Two days earlier during a meeting on immigration with bipartisan lawmakers, Trump said it was ""22 to 24 people came in through him."" We wondered if Trump was right: have at least 22 people come to the United States due to familial links to Saipov? Neither the White House nor the Department of Homeland Security provided information to substantiate Trump’s claims. A State Department spokesperson told us that visa records are confidential under immigration law, preventing comment on the details of individual visa cases. Experts told us Trump’s figures are improbable. Saipov, from Uzbekistan, entered the United States in 2010 through the diversity visa lottery program, which admits up to 50,000 people per year from countries with low levels of immigration to the United States. Applicants for the diversity program are able to include in their application their spouse and unmarried children under 21 years old. That is not what happened with Saipov, who arrived in 2010. Multiple news outlets reported that Saipov got married in the United States in 2013 to a woman who already lived here, also an Uzbek national. Their three children were all born in the United States. The family lived in Paterson, N.J. ""Unless Saipov had 22 unmarried, under-age-21 children at the time he came here, President Trump's statement that Saipov brought 22 people with him is clearly false,"" said Stephen H. Legomsky, an emeritus professor at the Washington University School of Law in St. Louis who served as chief counsel of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services from 2011 to 2013. Once in the United States, green card holders, such as Saipov, are only able to petition their spouse and unmarried children. We have not seen any reports of 29-year-old Saipov fathering more than 20 kids before he left Uzbekistan and petitioning for them to come to the United States since his arrival. Generally, is it possible for one green card holder to bring in 22 or more relatives? ""It may be possible, but it’s very unlikely,"" said Julia Gelatt, a senior policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute working with the U.S. Immigration Policy Program. ""Theoretically, if someone had many foreign-born children, and those children had many children, they could sponsor one spouse, plus 21 children and grandchildren. The grandchildren would come as derivatives of their children."" But that would be far above the average rate of family sponsorship, Gelatt said. A 2013 study found that overall, each new immigrant sponsored an average of 3.45 family members. As the New York Times and Washington Post’s Fact Checker have noted, if Saipov were a U.S. citizen (he's not) he could have petitioned his parents and three sisters to join him. There's no waiting period for parents, but brothers and sisters of adult U.S. citizens fall under a ""fourth-preference"" immigration category. As of Nov. 1, 2017, there were 2.3 million people in that category waiting for a visa, with a waiting period of over 13 years. The categories of family members that can be petitioned for admission are greater for U.S. citizens, who can additionally bring in parents, siblings, and married sons and daughters and their spouses and children. U.S. citizens can also petition a fiance(e) to come on a visa, and eventually file for a green card after marriage. Another immigrant accused of a separate attack, Akayed Ullah, ""benefited from extended family chain migration"" when he came to the United States from Bangladesh in 2011, DHS said. Ullah, accused of setting of a pipe bomb inside a New York City subway terminal, is also a green card holder. The department did not describe Saipov as having ""extended family chain migration."" Trump said that ""22 to 24 people"" came into the United States due to family connection with the suspect in the October 2017 New York City terror attack. The Trump administration did not provide any information to support this repeated claim about Saipov. Green card holders, such as Saipov, can only petition for a spouse and unmarried children to come to the United States. Media reports indicate that Saipov married a woman who already lived in the United States and that their three children were born in the United States. Saipov could not have petitioned parents or siblings in his current immigration status. Without evidence to support it, we rate Trump's claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AF6E80>],/factchecks/2018/jan/24/donald-trump/donald-trumps-unsubstantiated-claims-about-chain-m/

Mexico isn't the deadliest country in the world, as Trump said
","Defending the wall at the heart of a government shutdown, President Donald Trump pitched a fishy claim about Mexico’s security levels. ""We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country,"" Trump tweeted on Jan. 18, 2018. ""We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal!"" We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country. We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world. If there is no Wall, there is no Deal! Drug trade and policy experts generally agree a border wall likely would not have the impact Trump envisions, we found in a previous report. This time around, we decided to take a look at Mexican security. Was Mexico just rated the most dangerous country in the world? While there are multiple ways to measure danger, there is no single ranking for the most dangerous country in the world. The White House did not repond to our inquiry on the record. Mexico does rank first or third for the number of journalists killed for doing their jobs. However, it is out-ranked by other countries in other lists, such as countries’ homicides per capita. The only way Mexico falls first is if we only consider the International Press Institute’s number of journalists who were killed in 2017. The global journalism network tallied at least 14 journalists killed in Mexico in its December 2017 report. The Committee to Protect Journalists confirmed six cases of murder in retaliation for the journalists’ work, placing Mexico third for killings worldwide and first after conflict zones. The number of journalists killed in Mexico with confirmed motives reached a historical high in 2017, the committee found. Outside of journalism, Mexico scores high on danger levels, but not first. The Institute for Economics and Peace produces an annual Global Peace Index report, which measures the world’s most peaceful countries using 23 qualitative and quantitative measures of safety, security, ongoing domestic and international conflict, and militarization. Read inversely, the countries at the bottom of this list could be considered the ""least peaceful."" Mexico was ranked 22nd from the bottom of that list. Syria was worst. Frank Zimring, a crime expert at the University of California, Berkeley, said the two most useful measures of danger are the homicide rate of a country and the rate of some index of reported crime. Comparing crime across countries is difficult and discouraged due to disparities in legal definitions, incident reporting and data collection. The main study of intentional homicides is performed by the United Nations’ Office of Drug Control. The figures don’t include war-related killings and deaths from internal conflicts, which are generally far higher than intentional homicides. Mexico was 10th on the list in 2015, and El Salvador was first. There were 16 intentional homicides for every 100,000 people in Mexico, whereas El Salvador had 109 per 100,000 population. (The United States, by the way, was 54th.) ""While Mexico has a significant problem of violence, it is manifestly false that Mexico is the most dangerous country in the world,"" Mexico’s foreign ministry retaliated in a press release about Trump’s tweet. ""According to UN figures for 2014 (the most recent international report), Mexico is far from being one of the most violent countries. In Latin America alone, other countries have homicide rates higher than Mexico's (16.4), which is far below several countries in the region."" The most recent year, however, did see Mexico’s highest homicide count since the government began counting in 1997: 29,168 homicide cases in 2017, Mexico’s interior ministry told the Associated Press. That places it slightly above the regional average, according to Eric Olson, the deputy director of the Wilson Center’s Latin American program. ""To maintain that Mexico is the most violent country in the world would be a very subjective claim, and to say it’s the most homicidal is certifiably wrong,"" Olson said. Trump tweeted a similar claim in June: ""Mexico was just ranked the second deadliest country in the world, after only Syria."" Mexico was just ranked the second deadliest country in the world, after only Syria. Drug trade is largely the cause. We will BUILD THE WALL! The source of that claim was a report from the International Institute for Strategic Studies that said Mexico’s 2016 intentional homicide total, 23,000, was second only to Syria. After the statistic garnered heavy media attention, a press release revealed a ""methodological flaw"" in their fatalities calculation, which spokeswoman Anais Auvray said researchers are working to fix. Regardless, the report measured the gross number of homicides, which have little comparative value. For context, in 2015 the United States had half the homicide rate as Mexico, yet recorded 15,696 intentional homicides, to Mexico’s 20,762, according to the United Nations. The report also excludes other violent Latin American countries, like Brazil, which do not fit the institute’s criteria for armed conflict. ""The Armed Conflict Database and Survey do not measure homicides on either an absolute or per capita basis,"" a June 23, 2017, news release said. ""We estimate deaths directly related to conflict. We do not provide an assessment of the levels of violence in any country."" Trump tweeted that Mexico is ""now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world."" That is the case for journalists, according to two groups that track retaliatory murders. But it is not true for the risk to the broader public, which is not mentioned or clarified in Trump’s Twitter feed. Experts offered homicide measures as the best measure of a country’s security. By that token, Mexico ranked 10th in the United Nations’ homicides measures in 2015. Mexico’s homicide count reached a record peak last year, according to government statistics. While certainly a cause for concern, that’s doesn’t make Mexico the ""number one most dangerous country."" We rate this statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096888200>],/factchecks/2018/jan/24/donald-trump/mexico-isnt-deadliest-country-world-trump-said/
