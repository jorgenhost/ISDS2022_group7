Chris Christie repeats misleading statistic on Newark’s high school graduation rate
","
Gov. Chris Christie pushes his plans to reform New Jersey public schools using student performance in urban school districts as one of his statistical battering rams, but consistently misrepresents the high school graduation rate of the state’s largest district.

Christie claims fewer than 25 percent of freshmen in Newark high schools graduate in four years. PolitiFact New Jersey debunked similar statements twice -- first in June, then again in November. But the governor hasn’t learned his lesson and keeps repeating the statistic.

On Nov. 18, the day after we published a story criticizing Christie for his use of the statistic, the governor delivered the keynote address at a Notre Dame education forum. He said there: ""How hard is it to understand failure, when in Newark, the children this year, two months ago, who entered the ninth grade, 23 percent will graduate in four years with a high school diploma.""

More recently, in a Dec. 29 radio interview on WOR-AM, host John Gambling asked Christie what his biggest disappointment was in 2011.  

""The biggest disappointment is that we didn't get any education reform this year, and we really need to. Now, members of the Legislature are telling me that we're going to get to it in the first quarter of 2012. So I live in hope, John,"" Christie said. ""But my biggest disappointment is, when you know that the kids who start in the ninth grade in the city of Newark this past September, 23 percent of them will graduate in four years, 23 percent.""

He said to Gambling later in the interview, after also citing per-pupil spending costs in Newark: ""that's why education reform is so necessary and that's the biggest disappointment from 2011 is that we didn't get it done.""

Actually, more than half of Newark’s ninth grade students will graduate from high school in four years, because there’s more than one way recognized by the state Department of Education to earn a high school diploma.

But Christie cites the lower number, which represents a segment of the city’s high school graduates. Both graduation rates are included in a presentation based on a study by a private consulting firm that had ties to Christopher Cerf before he was named New Jersey’s acting education commissioner.

The smaller percentage -- 22 percent, not 23 percent, according to the presentation -- only includes students who graduate in four years by passing the High School Proficiency Assessment, a state standardized test. But there are other routes to graduation.

Students can take an alternate exam, now called the Alternative High School Assessment, to finish high school and some students are exempt from testing.

In all, 55 percent of students graduate from Newark’s high schools in four years, according to data from the 2009-2010 school year.

Though there is debate about the merits of the alternate exam, it is still a state-approved way to graduate from high school. And when Christie cites a graduation rate without explaining who it represents, he ignores a group of the students he argues it’s imperative to help.

The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Our ruling

Christie said ""that the kids who start in the ninth grade in the city of Newark this past September, 23 percent of them will graduate in four years.""

The claim has been debunked twice but Christie continues to repeat the erroneous statistic. About 55 percent of Newark freshmen graduate in four years, not 23 percent. Consistently repeating a proven falsehood isn’t just wrong, governor, it’s ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

DCCC says Jim Renacci was trying to avoid voting on payroll tax cut extension
","
Defeating a Democratic incumbent, as GOP Rep. Jim Renacci did in 2010, is a sure-fire way to become a regular target of the Democratic party’s congressional campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.

Throughout December 2011, the group made Renacci part of its ""Drive for 25"" campaign to target Republicans it deems politically vulnerable with robocalls, news releases, and online ads. It accused Renacci, of Wadsworth, Ohio, of personally thwarting budget cut negotiations by a so-called super committee that he was not a member of and pushing for tax cuts for the wealthy instead of the middle class.

The group launched a robocall campaign against Renacci on Dec. 9, telling voters that Renacci ""is trying to leave town for the holidays without extending your payroll tax cut."" They accused Republicans of trying to ""force a $1,000 payroll tax increase on 160 million middle class Americans, while fighting for billionaires and Big Oil."" They then offered to connect callers to Renacci’s office, to tell the congressman ""that it is unacceptable to leave Washington for the holidays and raise your taxes.""

As Renacci prepared to vote on a Dec. 13 GOP plan that combined the payroll tax cut extension with other GOP priorities, including accelerated review of the Keystone XL oil pipeline, Democrats hammered him with yet another news release accusing him of trying to skip off on vacation ""rather than protect 5.8 million middle income Ohio families from a $1,000 payroll tax increase.""

Renacci backed the GOP package, which most Democrats opposed because they disliked other parts of the bill. For example, fellow Ohioan Rep. Marcia Fudge said she objected to provisions it contained that would reduce the length of time people could collect unemployment benefits and permit states to require drug testing for beneficiaries.

Before the vote, President Barack Obama said he would not accept a measure that tied the payroll tax reductions to ""a whole bunch of extraneous issues,"" and leaders of the Democrat-controlled U.S. Senate said it would die there after passing the House.

Renacci said he was pleased that the bill contained his idea to allow states to redirect unemployment benefits to employers for use in hiring unemployed workers. Renacci wanted to make sure that any payroll tax cut extension in the bill would be paid for by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget, said his spokesman, Shawn Ryan.

Ryan called it ""absurd"" for the DCCC to claim that Renacci was eager to leave town without taking care of the payroll tax issue. He noted that a Nov. 21 news release from Renacci called on all members of Congress to stay in Washington through the holidays ""until a plan to control our massive yearly deficits is finalized.""

So we asked the DCCC how it could allege that Renacci was trying to leave town without voting on the payroll tax issue when he supported a measure that would make the desired cuts to pay for it.

The DCCC responded that Renacci has not backed ""clean votes"" on extending the payroll tax, and only backed legislation that he knew had no chance for passage.

Fair enough, but that’s a lot different from the claim that he was trying to leave town without voting on the issue at all.

The Democrats have a point about the slim prospects for passage of the GOP payroll tax bill that Renacci backed. Senate President Harry Reid said the bill would be dead on arrival, and the legislation, in fact, went no where in the Senate. Ultimately, Renacci and other members of the House backed a Senate compromise that extended the payroll tax reduction for two months.

With newly drawn congressional districts in Ohio, Renacci faces an election challenge from Rep. Betty Sutton, a Democrat whose district was carved up on the new map. PolitiFact Ohio is sure that this salvo is just the beginning, with many claims to come from both sides.

But as for this one, Renacci indicated he was open to extending the payroll tax cut and did vote for a bill that contained the extension. And the DCCC asserted no grounds of support for the claim that that Renacci wanted to leave Washington without voting.

On the Truth-O-Meter, we rate the DCCC’s claim False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/05/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-says-jim-renacci-was-trying-avoid-voting-payr/

Ron Paul says majority of Americans favors gold standard
","
After his third-place finish in the Iowa caucuses Jan. 3, 2012, Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, told supporters that his campaign has been propelled by the issues he champions, including slashing government spending, abolishing the Federal Reserve System and withdrawing from Afghanistan.

Paul also said that ""today there was a national poll that came out and they were talking about how many people supported the gold standard. How long has it been since they've taken a national poll on the gold standard? And guess what? The majority of the American people believe we should have a gold standard and not a paper standard"" for U.S. currency.

Really?

First, let’s discuss what the gold standard is. Here’s a June 23, 2011, summary from the Congressional Research Service, a nonpartisan office that provides information to Congress:

Today, ""the U.S. monetary system is based on paper money backed by the full faith and credit of the federal government. The currency is neither valued in, backed by, nor officially convertible into gold or silver. Through much of its history, however, the United States was on a metallic standard of one sort or another.""

The pure gold standard ended in 1933, CRS said, ""when the federal government halted convertibility of notes into gold and nationalized the private gold stock."" Remnants persisted until the early 1970s, but then disappeared. Advocates have continued to push for reinstatement of the gold standard, in part to constrain inflation and shore up the dollar’s value.

Ralph J. Benko, a senior adviser for economics with the group American Principles in Action, which favors a return to the gold standard, wrote in a blog post earlier this year that ""the value of the dollar has eroded by some 95 percent from the day my father was born until today. For the most part it has been a slow process of erosion rather than a dramatic event. That said, history records that the gold dollar held its value – over centuries — and under the gold dollar, history records that … the economy grew, on balance, more steadily and robustly than it has since the last remnants of the gold standard were repudiated.""

This view is hardly universal among economists. Critics say that switching back to the gold standard would be impractical and unwise and potentially limit a government's ability to deal with recessions and depressions through monetary policy.

We'll leave the policy debate to others. What we're fact-checking is whether there’s as much public support for the idea as Paul claimed.

When we asked Paul’s campaign to point us to the survey showing national interest in restoring the gold standard, spokesman Jesse Benton pointed us to a column by gold standard supporter Benko and Andresen Blom, executive director of American Principles in Action, that appeared in the Jan. 3, 2012, edition of the Capitol Hill newspaper Roll Call.

The column mentions three surveys conducted on behalf of their organization by the Polling Co. Inc., a Washington, D.C., firm. The polls surveyed likely Republican primary voters and caucus-goers in states whose voters act first in choosing delegates for the presidential race -- Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina.

""Fifty percent of New Hampshire voters favor the gold standard, with more than half of those favoring it ‘very strongly,’"" Benko and Blom wrote. Similar polls in Iowa and South Carolina found support for the gold standard at 57 and 51 percent.

We asked American Principles in Action for the full data on New Hampshire, which they provided. The poll of 500 likely Republican primary voters had a margin of sampling error of 4.4 percent. It asked, among other questions, ""Do you have a favorable or unfavorable opinion of returning the U.S. monetary system to the gold standard?""

The poll found that 29 percent had a ""very favorable"" opinion and 21 percent had a ""somewhat favorable"" opinion, for a total of 50 percent. Majorities in the Iowa and South Carolina polls also supported the idea.

So Paul is correct on the number -- but way off on the description. This was not a ""national poll"" that shows that a ""majority of the American people believe we should have a gold standard."" Instead, it was three polls in three states, with respondents from only one party -- and even among this narrow sample, it only asked those who are active enough politically to be considered likely to participate in the upcoming primary. The survey was also commissioned by a group that supports the gold standard.

And what about national polls? There was one, but it doesn’t perfectly support Paul’s thesis.

Rasmussen Reports took a national poll of 1,000 likely voters Oct. 18 and 19, 2011, with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.

Rasmussen found that 44 percent of likely voters had a favorable impression of returning the U.S. monetary system to the gold standard, or, broken down, 15 percent very favorable and 29 percent somewhat favorable.

That’s closer to the majority mark, but it’s worth noting a few qualifiers. Among pollsters, Rasmussen, which describes itself as nonpartisan, has a reputation of producing polls that skew Republican. In addition, this poll was of likely voters, which uses a smaller pool of respondents than the default method, which is to poll all registered voters.

Most significantly, 44 percent isn’t a majority, though Rasmussen did find that 57 percent of likely voters agreed with the gold standard after they were asked this follow-up question: ""Many say that adopting the gold standard would dramatically reduce the power of central bankers and political leaders to steer the economy. If you knew that returning to the gold standard really would reduce the power of central bankers and political leaders to steer the economy, would you favor or oppose returning to the gold standard?"" However, framing the question like that is hardly a neutral wording of the question.

Jeff Bell, the policy director of American Principles in Action, told us that the Rasmussen poll does not show there’s a national majority in favor of the gold standard.

Bell told PolitiFact that those in favor amount to ""a plurality of the voters as a whole, unless you ask modifying questions, which aren’t completely kosher in national polling.""

When we told Benton, Paul’s spokesman, that the polls to which he referred us were of likely Republican primary voters in particular states -- not a national poll -- he said of Paul’s caucus-night comment, ""Relax, dude, it was a rally speech to supporters, not a major policy speech or a debate.""

Our ruling

Paul says ""the majority of the American people believe we should have a gold standard and not a paper standard."" But the polls his campaign cited to back up that claim surveyed likely Republican primary voters in three states -- not voters nationwide. The one national poll that addressed this question found 44 percent in favor of a gold standard, and that isn’t a majority. On balance, we rate Paul’s statement False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/04/ron-paul/ron-paul-says-majority-americans-favors-gold-stand/
"['National', 'Welfare', 'Rick Santorum']","
Rick Santorum ad claims he reformed welfare
","
A new Rick Santorum campaign ad asks, ""Who has the best chance to beat Obama?""

The answer: Santorum, of course.

As images appear of the Republican presidential hopeful on the stump and walking with his wife, a voice-over calls him a ""full-spectrum conservative"" and ""a favorite of the tea party for fighting corruption and taxpayer abuse.""

Then the words ""reformed welfare"" pop up in white type.

Santorum, a former Pennsylvania senator who also served two terms in the House, made welfare reform a central issue during his congressional career. So we wondered, among the many prominent politicians who also have worked to reform welfare, how does he stack up?

Efforts in Congress

When Bill Clinton was elected president in 1992, he pledged to ""end welfare as we know it.""

Santorum, then serving in the House, was among a group of Republicans determined to hold the new president to his promise.

In early 1993, Santorum helped write legislation that tied cash benefits to participation in work and educational programs, with the goal of moving people off of welfare rolls permanently. Newspaper accounts from the time call him a ""chief sponsor"" of the bill who ""helped shape the Republican position on welfare reform.""

That bill sputtered, but what evolved was a years-long battle between Clinton and Republicans in Congress over how to reform the system. In 1994, Santorum was elected to the Senate, where he immersed himself in the fight.

""The strict conservatives believe the bottom line is, let's cut this thing, let's save money,"" he said in 1995, according to the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""The rest of us, which I believe is a majority of Republicans, believe this is the number-one societal problem, that it's at the root of the disintegration of families in the inner city, the social decay we have seen in the last 20 years.

""What we have to stop doing is guaranteeing people failure. These programs have done nothing but keep people poor. Sure they put food on the table, but they don't provide much hope.""

Clinton vetoed two bills before signing landmark legislation in August 1996 that ended guaranteed cash benefits put in place under Franklin Roosevelt and transferred more control over welfare to the states.

Experts’ takes

We talked to several experts about the ad’s claim, and all agreed that Santorum was at the forefront of the welfare reform fight, even as a junior legislator.

""He certainly didn't reform welfare by himself,"" said Lawrence Mead, a politics and public policy professor at New York University and a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""He was less important than the more senior congressional leaders or President Clinton, let alone the myriad state and local officials who finally made it happen at the local level. But he was more important than the average member of Congress. The whole episode was a credit to him.""

Ron Haskins, who was a key Republican staffer in drafting the reform and who also wrote the book Work Over Welfare: The Inside Story of the 1996 Welfare Reform Law, had this to say:

""He deserves as much credit for welfare reform as anyone with the possible exceptions of (former Florida congressman) Clay Shaw and Bill Clinton. He wrote the bill that was part of the Contract with America which set the pattern for all subsequent Republican welfare reform bills. In addition, he ran the floor debate in the Senate even though he was a freshman member,"" Haskins, now a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said in an e-mail.

Our ruling

Santorum’s ad said simply that he ""reformed welfare.""

Santorum was a leader in the 1990s efforts to overhaul the nation’s system for aiding poor families, reshaping the program into one that encourages recipients to move toward financial independence. He had a hand in writing Republican bills and was influential in the process in both the House and Senate. But no one reformed welfare alone. Although he was a key player, Santorum’s ad ignores others who helped usher in change -- including some who played even larger roles than he did. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/04/rick-santorum/rick-santorum-ad-claims-he-reformed-welfare/
"['National', 'Campaign Finance', 'Barack Obama']","
Barack Obama's campaign says it doesn't accept lobbyist donations
","
In late December, President Barack Obama’s re-election campaign made a fundraising pitch that, among other things, touted the measures his campaign is taking to distance itself from lobbyists:

""We don't take a dime from D.C. lobbyists or special-interest PACs -- never have and never will.""

A reader pointed out this claim and asked us if it’s true.

First, we checked with the Obama campaign, and a spokeswoman confirmed that the campaign does not accept money from federally registered lobbyists, either making direct donations themselves or serving as ""bundlers"" who solicit and package donations from others. To enforce that policy, the campaign continually reviews the federal lobbyist registry.

On the surface, the Obama campaign’s claim seems plausible. But we think it’s important to add some context about how this pledge is phrased.

A key issue is how you define the word ""lobbyist.""

As we noted in a recent item, to be a registered lobbyist, one has to meet a number of detailed rules laid out in federal law. One of the main rules is that a person has to register if he or she holds two or more meetings with elected officials or staff in any quarter of the year on behalf of a client. Also, lobbying activities must constitute 20 percent or more of the lobbyist’s time during any three-month period. (Want more detail? Read 27 pages of guidance on disclosing lobbying activities via the U.S. Senate website.)
   
Experts we spoke to said that it’s not uncommon for a former lawmaker or other senior political official to offer ""strategic advice"" without having to register as a lobbyist.
   
Strategic advisers can do quite a bit for clients without acquiring the lobbyist label. They can give advice on individuals to meet with and what arguments to make. They can instruct someone who is a registered lobbyist, again telling the lobbyist with whom to meet and what to address. They may take clients to meetings with non-governmental groups, such as grassroots political groups. They may even have one big meeting with an elected official to make a case for a client.
   
""There’s a lot of activity that ordinary people would think of as lobbying that doesn’t trigger the obligation to register as a lobbyist under federal law. Strategic advice is one of those kinds of things that doesn’t,"" said Joseph Sandler, an attorney with the Washington law firm Sandler Reiff Young & Lamb. Sandler was one of four co-chairs of an American Bar Association task force that recommended changes to federal lobbying laws to improve disclosure and reduce conflicts of interest.

So by the campaign’s standard, a strategic adviser who doesn’t officially register to lobby -- or a former lobbyist who is no longer registered, or someone who supervises lobbyists but isn’t registered -- is free to give money to the campaign or serve as a bundler.

According to an Oct. 27, 2011, New York Times report, at least 15 of Obama’s bundlers, who collectively have raised at least $5 million, ""are involved in lobbying for Washington consulting shops or private companies,"" advocating interests from ""telecommunications and high-tech software to Wall Street finance, international commerce and pharmaceuticals.""

None of these 15 bundlers is ""currently registered as a federal lobbyist,"" the Times reported. But ""at least four of them have been (officially registered lobbyists) in the past. And a number of the bundlers work for prominent lobbying and law firms, including Greenberg Traurig and Blank Rome.""

As examples, the Times cited Sally Susman, David L. Cohen and Michael Kempner, all of whom have raised at least $500,000 for the campaign.

Susman, an executive with drug-maker Pfizer, ""helped organize a $35,800-a-ticket dinner that Mr. Obama attended in Manhattan in June. At the same time, she leads Pfizer’s powerful lobbying shop, and she has visited the White House four times since 2009 — twice on export issues. But under the byzantine rules that govern federal lobbying, Ms. Susman has not registered with the Senate as a lobbyist.""

Meanwhile, Cohen ""oversees lobbying at the Comcast Corporation"" and ""hosted the president and some 120 guests"" at his home in Philadelphia, the Times reported. Guests ""paid at least $10,000 each to attend; Mr. Obama called Mr. Cohen and his wife ‘great friends.’""

And Kempner ""runs a team of Washington lobbyists"" at the MWW Group, a New Jersey-based firm where he serves as CEO. The firm employs seven registered lobbyists in Washington, even though Kempner himself is not one.

The Obama campaign notes that its policy is still more stringent than federal law requires and adds that many of the Republican presidential campaigns have more permissive rules on lobbyist donations. The Obama campaign, for instance, voluntarily releases its list of bundlers.

In addition, the Obama campaign is hardly alone in setting the standards as it has. Experts we spoke to said that it’s not uncommon for campaigns to say they’re banning lobbyist money but to allow the same sorts of activities permitted by the Obama campaign.

""A world of strategic consultants and state-level lobbyists can, and do, give,"" said Meredith McGehee, policy director for the Campaign Legal Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that analyzes campaign-finance issues.

There are other ways for a campaign to benefit from the support of lobbyists without accepting their money.

""Even campaigns that say they will not accept lobbyists’ campaign contributions typically accept other forms of help from lobbyists, such as door knocking, poll watching and the like,"" said Robert K. Kelner, an attorney with the firm Covington & Burling who specializes in political and election law.

Lobbyists can also make sure that their clients ""are given good advice on where and when to give, especially with all the entities available -- candidate PACs, leadership PACs, super PACs, 501(c)4s, trade associations, party committees, state party committees and so on,"" McGehee said. ""A big dog lobbyist will help steer their clients, and the executives of that client, to ‘smart’ giving.""

Our ruling

The Obama campaign has a point that it doesn’t ""take a dime from D.C. lobbyists or special-interest PACs."" But this leaves out important details. The campaign -- like others before it -- uses a narrow definition of ""lobbyist"" that allows donations and fundraising by people who most likely look, to the average American, like ""lobbyists,"" even if they are not officially. In addition, the Obama campaign’s policy doesn’t bar even federally registered lobbyists from serving as volunteers for the campaign, as long as they don’t give or bundle money.

New Jersey residents earning $1 million face an effective tax rate about four times greater than residents at $100,000, assemblyman says
","
Earning $1 million in New Jersey can buy many things, but it also means you’ll be sending a larger share of your income to Trenton. 
As state legislators remain divided over reinstituting a so-called ""millionaires tax,"" state Assemblyman Declan O’Scanlon (R-Monmouth) argued in an opinion piece last month that millionaires are already paying a larger share of their earnings toward state income taxes than people earning $100,000.

""Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay,"" O’Scanlon wrote in the Dec. 16 piece published in The Star-Ledger. ""When and how will we know when we’ve achieved ‘fairness’?""

Millionaires are paying an ""effective tax rate"" four times more than those earning $100,000?

That’s right, PolitiFact New Jersey found. According to the New Jersey Department of the Treasury, taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective income tax rate of 6.88 percent, compared with 1.73 percent for people earning $100,000.

O’Scanlon told us his point was that those earning $1 million already pay their fair share. An increase in income taxes could drive people out of the state or discourage them from moving to New Jersey, O’Scanlon said.

""It’s wonderful politics,"" O’Scanlon said. ""It’s lousy policy.""

First, let’s explain what an ""effective tax rate"" is.

New Jersey currently imposes state income tax rates ranging from 1.4 percent on income of $20,000 or less to a top rate of 8.97 percent on income of $500,001 or greater.

But those rates don’t represent what individuals actually pay in total income taxes, because a person’s income faces different rates as his income increases. Also, taxpayers can receive various exemptions and deductions.

So, the ""effective tax rate"" represents the percentage of one’s gross income that actually goes toward income taxes.

Andrew Pratt, a Treasury Department spokesman, told us the department calculated effective tax rates for O’Scanlon, per the following income levels:

$100,000: 1.73 percent
$1 million: 6.88 percent
$5 million: 8.5 percent
$10 million: 8.72 percent

Based on those numbers, someone earning $1 million is paying $68,800 in state income taxes, compared to $1,730 for taxpayers earning $100,000.

For individuals with smaller incomes, the effective tax rate is even less. Taxpayers earning between $20,001 and $50,000 pay an effective tax rate of 0.7 percent, according to the state Treasury department.

Pratt also noted how higher-income earners represent a small percentage of taxpayers, but provide a significant portion of the tax revenue.

""Notice that income over $500,000 represents an infinitesimal 0.2 percent of taxpayers, yet brings in 34.1 percent of tax revenue,"" Pratt said in an email. ""Throw in the rest of the top 1 percent of taxpayers, and you get 37 percent of total tax collections.""

Roberton Williams, a senior fellow with the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, told us an effective tax rate is the ""appropriate measure to assess tax burden.""

""That's the share of income going to taxes. A person's effective tax rate equals her tax liability divided by her pretax income,"" Williams said in an email. ""Thus a person making $100,000 and paying a total of $15,000 in tax(es) faces an effective tax rate of 15%.""

Our ruling

In an opinion piece in the Star-Ledger, O’Scanlon wrote: ""Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate that is about four times what taxpayers earning $100,000 pay.""

Based on data from the state Treasury department, O’Scanlon is correct. Taxpayers earning $1 million pay an effective tax rate of 6.88 percent, which is about four times the 1.73 percent paid by individuals earning $100,000.

We rate the statement True.

Georgia unemployment rate higher than nation
","
State lawmaker Buddy Carter wants to help more Georgians find jobs. In the process, he gave us some work to do.

Carter, a Republican senator from Pooler, located near Savannah, wrote a column on his website in mid-December full of numbers and data highlighting Georgia’s high unemployment rate. There was one claim in it that we found particularly curious.

""Currently, Georgia’s unemployment rate stands at 10.2 [percent] while the national rate is at 9 [percent]. Perhaps even more disturbing is that Georgia’s unemployment rate has exceeded the national rate for 50 consecutive months,"" he wrote.

Has the state’s unemployment rate been higher than the national rate for 50 straight months?

We chose the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics to check out the senator’s claim. The federal agency keeps detailed data on unemployment for the nation and each state (the numbers include job growth or decline in various industries) and is used by most economists.

When Carter wrote his column, October 2011 was the most recent month that the bureau had unemployment data for Georgia and the nation. That month, the unemployment rate in the state was 10.2 percent. The unemployment rate for the entire country was 9 percent.

In each month of 2011, the unemployment rate in Georgia ranged between a high of 10.3 percent in January and September and a low of 9.8 percent, which was recorded in April and May. The highest national monthly unemployment rate was recorded in June, at 9.2 percent. So far, Carter is correct, which is 10 months.

How about 2010? Carter was right. The highest monthly national rate was 9.8 percent, which was recorded in April and November. The unemployment rate for Georgia those months were 10.1 and 10.4 percent, respectively. Georgia’s unemployment rate for the other 10 months of 2010 was at least 0.5 percentage points higher than the nation.

That adds up to 22 months of a higher unemployment rate for the Peach State.

Let’s go to 2009. Georgia’s unemployment rate rose steadily from 8.5 percent in January to 10.4 percent in October, November and December. Again, Georgia had a higher unemployment rate than the nation in each month of that year. The closest Georgia came to having a lower rate than the nation was May, when the state’s rate was 9.6 percent and the national rate was 9.4 percent.

OK, so when was the last time the nation’s unemployment rate was the same or eclipsed Georgia’s? Answer: July 2007. In that month, the national rate and Georgia’s were 4.7 percent, according to the BLS.

Carter was correct. We rate the claim in his column as True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/04/buddy-carter/georgia-unemployment-rate-higher-nation/

The issue doesn't generate many headlines, but proposed changes in trucking's Hours-of-Service regulations have stirred hot controversy in the industry.

The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration, which developed the rules, says they were based on an exhaustive review of research on the science on driver alertness and working hours, ""and strike the crucial balance between safety and economic vitality.""

The committee chairman, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio's 4th District, stressed how widely the regulations would be felt: ""The vast majority of all retailers, and 80 percent of all U.S. communities, depend solely on trucks to deliver and supply the products sold in stores or ordered on-line,"" he said.

That caught the interest of PolitiFact Ohio. We asked Jordan's office for more information.

Jordan’s press secretary, Meghan Snyder, said the 80 percent figure came from the American Trucking Associations, which cited the Rand McNally Commercial Atlas & Marketing Guide.

Darrin Roth, director of highway operations for the American Trucking Associations, confirmed that. He said his group had found the number of communities served by railroads -- 18.3 percent -- ""and did the inverse.""

He sent us the spreadsheet from atlas publisher Rand McNally showing state-by-state figures for rail service.

It had the 18.3 percent figure. It also showed a slightly smaller percentage for Ohio, where 627 communities of a total 3,516 (or 17.8 percent) were shown having rail service.

We found that puzzling for another reason. Census data on the website of Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted show Ohio with 247 cities, 691 villages and 1,308 townships, for a total of 2,246 divisions.

That's 1,270 fewer than the number of communities cited by Rand McNally. Where did they get their figure?

Rand McNally's media relations department told us that they have not produced the Commercial Atlas & Marketing Guide ""in many years, so we can't query the database any longer to specifically explain the difference in Ohio.""

In fact, the spreadsheet the American Trucking Associations provided lists its data source as from May 2000.

The atlas maker’s mapping specialists provided this explanation about the communities: ""Rand McNally included unincorporated places into the count which would make our number higher. Rand McNally had its own criteria for smaller populated places that would differ from the Census. Over the last decade that we produced the Commercial Atlas, Rand McNally continually analyzed and removed some of these smaller populated places year after year as population decreased from these older places or they went out of existence. These sometimes included rail yards, postal facilities, parks, etc., with small populations around them. In some portions of the country, this could result in significant differences between the Census reporting of 'community' and ours.""

In other words, city neighborhoods and rural crossings that are not distinct governmental entities might have been counted as communities. And while an area like Greater Cleveland most definitely has rail service, not all of the area's hundreds of neighborhoods and suburbs do.

Jordan's statement originates with a credible source -- Rand McNally. And the cited data backs his claim that ""80 percent of all U.S. communities depend solely on trucks to deliver and supply the products sold in stores or ordered online.""

But it also should be noted that Rand McNally hasn’t produced the Commercial Atlas & Marketing Guide ""in many years,"" and it is that data that the American Trucking Associations used to generate the figure of 80 percent. That’s a piece of information that provides clarification.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Jordan’s claim rates as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2012/jan/04/jim-jordan/jim-jordan-says-truck-services-often-only-link-us-/

Rick Perry says Rick Santorum voted for a teapot museum
","
Heading into the Iowa Caucus, Texas Gov. Rick Perry was working to stir a tempest in Rick Santorum’s teapot.

Perry’s campaign released a Web ad, taking Santorum, the former Pennsylvania Senator, to task for supporting a string of earmarks during his time in Washington.

The ad, launched Jan. 2, 2012, on Perry’s Website, accuses Santorum, who had surged in Iowa polls, of voting to spend taxpayer money on a teapot museum in North Carolina, among other earmarked projects.

""Why are these pigs so happy? … Because Rick Santorum is a porker’s best friend,"" reads the ad, titled ""Rick Santorum - Unelectable,"" which depicts a herd of pigs.

""Santorum voted to spend millions on the Bridge to Nowhere,"" the ad reads. ""Santorum also voted for a teapot museum in North Carolina.""

PolitiFact looked into Perry’s claim about the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" earlier this week, ruling it Mostly True. But is Perry right that Santorum voted in favor of the teapot museum, as well?

In the advertisement, the Perry campaign cites Senate Roll Call vote 264 of 2005, in which the U.S. Senate passed the related appropriations bill by a 93-1 vote.

The legislation, sponsored by Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., included $450,000 in funding for the New River Community Partners Museum Development Project, which was responsible for the Sparta Teapot Museum of Craft & Design in North Carolina. Museum Managers started working in 2003 to raise funds for a new building to house a private collection of more than 6,000 teapots.

In October 2005, Santorum voted in favor of the Senate appropriations bill, along with each of his Republican colleagues present at the time. And he reaffirmed his support the next month when he allowed the legislation, which had been combined with the House version, to pass by unanimous consent.

The only other current presidential candidate serving in Congress at the time, U.S. Rep. Ron Paul, R-Texas, did not vote either on the House bill or the combined proposal.

But does Santorum’s vote indicate support for the museum itself? Analysts say maybe not.

Representatives from the Santorum campaign didn’t return requests Tuesday for comment about the teapot museum. But, last week, he defended his support for earmarks to a crowd at an Iowa town hall meeting.

""Go and look at the Constitution. Who has the responsibility to spend money? Clearly, in the Constitution it is the Congress,"" Santorum said, according to the Des Moines Register.

""Now what has happened is that the system was abused, and it got a bad name, and as a result of that, I have said, ‘Look. the Congress has lost the public trust, and (earmarks) have to be suspended.’""

Relating specifically to the 2005 appropriations bill, Santorum’s positive vote does not necessarily indicate support for the teapot museum, according to some analysts.

In total, the bill included billions of dollars in funding for more than 1,100 earmarks, according to the House report.

Among the thousands of earmarks, the final version of the bill directed funding to nearly 70 projects in Santorum’s native Pennsylvania, including $750,000 for a Sept.11 memorial garden in Lower Makefield Township; $250,000 for the YWCA in Chester; and $200,000 for the Pittsburgh zoo, according to the bill report.

""(The teapot museum) became a very symbolic needle, but it's a needle in the haystack nonetheless,"" said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a non-partisan group that tracks federal earmarks.

""Did he vote for it? Yeah. He voted for funding the Department of Transportation, Housing and Urban Development and everything else,"" Ellis said. ""That said, don't vote for things if you don't want to be called out for supporting them.""

As a side note: the federal money for the Sparta Teapot Museum was returned in 2009 after the museum board disbanded and the facility closed due to lack of funding, according to the museum website.

Our ruling: The 2005 appropriations bill did fund the teapot museum, along with more than 1,100 other earmarked projects. But, Santorum didn’t vote for the museum in particular. He voted for the total appropriations bill, which provided billions in funding for federal transportation and housing projects, among others.

Rick Santorum says he's won votes of Democrats, independents in Pennsylvania
","
One of the attributes Rick Santorum often cites on the campaign trail is that he won repeatedly in Pennsylvania -- a state that has voted Democratic for president in every election since 1992.

Santorum -- a former two-term Republican senator from Pennsylvania -- has made this argument to counter the contention that his strong social conservatism makes him less electable in a general election than former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney.

During a Dec. 29, 2011, interview on NBC’s Today, Savannah Guthrie asked Santorum, ""Should Republicans … today be concerned about this issue of electability should you be the nominee against Barack Obama?""

Here’s Santorum’s full response:

""Absolutely they should be concerned about the electability. I'm the only one in this race that has a track record of winning elections in tough states. I had a million more registered Democrats than Republicans. And in two statewide elections, you know, running against very strong candidates, I was able to win the state of Pennsylvania, something a Republican hasn't done for president since 1988.

""And so if you look at everybody else in the field, no one has ever run as a conservative and been able to attract independents and Democrats to win. I have. And I think that's one of the reasons the people in Iowa are looking us. They say, ‘Wow, this guy's defeated, you know, straight up two Democratic incumbents to win his House seat and -- and Senate seat in very tough districts and in a very tough state.’""

There’s a lot to look at here. Let’s go race by race.

House elections

In 1990, Santorum, a 32-year-old lawyer, challenged seven-term Democratic incumbent Doug Walgren. ""Santorum knocked on 25,000 doors, amassed an army of volunteers including many right-to-lifers, attacked Walgren for voting for a pay raise seven times and for living in the Washington suburbs,"" according to the Almanac of American Politics. Despite being outspent, $717,000 to $251,000, Santorum won, 51 percent to 49 percent.

This district leaned Democratic, but after the 1990 Census, redistricting made it even more so. Yet Santorum won his 1992 re-election bid easily, defeating a Democratic state senator, 61 to 38 percent.

It’s worth noting that in this district -- and much of western Pennsylvania -- there are lots of voters who register as Democrats but who are substantially more conservative than the party label would suggest. Many are ethnic and blue-collar Democrats who are socially conservative, particularly on abortion. So as a Catholic politician staunchly opposed to abortion, Santorum was well positioned to win support from voters who were traditionally Democratic but whose leanings on social issues more closely mirrored those of the GOP.

 ""Those voters may be Democrats, but they are conservative, anti-communist (this still mattered in the 1980s and early 1990s), Catholic, pro-life, pro-gun, pro-manufacturing, and not-so pro-environment. Santorum fit perfectly,"" said David Patti, who heads the Pennsylvania Business Council and who worked in the Ronald Reagan campaign in Pittsburgh in 1984

So Santorum’s claim needs a bit of an asterisk. Still, he has a point. Under the district lines first used in 1992, Democratic candidates for president won easily -- Bill Clinton won, 52 to 39 percent, in 1996, and Al Gore won, 57 to 41 percent, in 2000. Clearly, then, lots of voters in the district were comfortable voting for Santorum, Clinton and Gore.

1994 Senate race

In 1994, Santorum challenged liberal Democratic Sen. Harris Wofford, who had been elected in a 1991 special election.

In 1991, Wofford -- running against a popular former Republican governor, Richard Thornburgh -- had won 61 percent of the vote in metropolitan Pittsburgh. But against Santorum, who hailed from the area, Wofford won metro Pittsburgh by only a 50 to 47 percent margin. This significant underperformance suggests that Santorum remained popular in his home region, which includes many Democrats. (Statewide, Santorum won narrowly, 49 to 47 percent.)

Here, too, it’s worth noting an asterisk: 1994 was the year of a Republican congressional landslide. This may not have greatly helped Santorum’s standing among Democrats, but his anti-incumbent status probably boosted his appeal among independents.

The best way to measure Santorum’s appeal for Democrats and independents in 1994 is through exit polls, in which pollsters gather data from voters exiting polling places on Election Day. However, when we contacted the main archive for exit polls -- the University of Connecticut’s Roper Center -- they told us that the statewide data was not in an easily usable form for 1994.

2000 Senate race

Of Santorum’s three Senate races, 2000 is the only one conducted in what might be called a ""neutral"" political environment -- neither the Republican rout of 1994, nor the Democratic tsunami of 2006. In 2000, by contrast, the presidential race ended in a virtual tie. For this reason, it may be the best test of Santorum’s argument that he’s ""been able to attract independents and Democrats.""

In 2000, Santorum’s strong conservatism initially made him look vulnerable for voters in a swing state. But in the general election, he faced Rep. Ron Klink, who had emerged from a multi-candidate Democratic primary with little money and not much of a statewide profile. Klink, like many western Pennsylvania Democrats, was anti-abortion and pro-gun, lessening his appeal for many fellow Democrats and making it hard for him to replenish his treasury. Ultimately, Santorum outspent Klink 3-to-1 and won a second term, 52 to 46 percent.

Fortunately, the Roper Center does have a breakdown of the 2000 Pennsylvania exit poll.

It shows that self-identified Democratic voters split their votes in the Senate race as follows: 80 percent for Klink, 18 percent for Santorum. Among self-identified independents, the breakdown was 55 percent for Santorum, 41 percent for Klink.

So Santorum’s record of Democratic support in his home district and regionally largely didn’t carry over to the statewide Senate race of 2000. He lost Democrats statewide by a 4-to-1 margin.

However, he has a point that he was able to win independent votes. Against Klink, he won a clear majority of independents in 2000.

2006 Senate race

In 2006, Democrats were buoyed by voter fatigue with President George W. Bush. Santorum faced a strong candidate -- Robert Casey, a former Pennsylvania auditor general and state treasurer who was the son of a popular former governor. In fact, the incumbent was considered an underdog for most, if not all, of the campaign.

In a year when the Democrats took over the House and Senate, Santorum was trounced, as Casey won, 59 to 41 percent.

The exit polls found that Democrats backed Casey over Santorum, 93 percent to 7 percent. Even independents abandoned Santorum, backing Casey by a 72 to 28 percent margin.

So whatever juice Santorum had among either group of voters essentially vanished in the Democratic wave election of 2006.

Our ruling

We come to a mixed verdict on Santorum’s claim that he has ""been able to attract independents and Democrats to win"" elections in Pennsylvania.

Santorum can point to solid evidence that he won over Democrats and independents in his two House races and in his wave-aided 1994 Senate election. However, since many of the conservative Democrats, including those in his home district, have either left the Democratic Party or voted increasingly for Republicans over the last quarter century, it’s not clear how relevant this fact is in bolstering the case that Santorum can win votes from disaffected Obama Democrats in 2012.

Meanwhile, Santorum lost badly statewide among Democrats in 2000 and 2006, and while he won independents in 2000, he lost them by a large margin in the Democratic wave of 2006. If anything, the general trend is that Santorum has done less well among Democrats and independents over time, and as he’s run for bigger political offices.

Chris Christie blames Corzine for New Year’s toll hikes
","
The news might have hit motorists like a rock smacking against a windshield, but the recent toll increases on the New Jersey Turnpike and the Garden State Parkway should not come as a complete surprise.

They were approved more than three years ago.

Gov. Chris Christie, a Republican, has reminded listeners of that history during various radio interviews in recent weeks. During a Dec. 23 interview with WFAN’s Boomer Esiason and Craig Carton, the governor corrected Carton when the co-host said Christie was raising tolls by 50 percent.

""Oh, and by the way, I’m not raising tolls 50 percent,"" Christie said.

Carton asked, ""Who is?""

""Jon Corzine did,"" the governor responded.

PolitiFact New Jersey found that Christie has his facts straight.

The toll hikes, which took effect New Year’s Day, represent the second phase of a two-part rate increase approved by the New Jersey Turnpike Authority in October 2008 under then-Gov. Jon Corzine. A Democrat, Corzine, signed off on the plan.

The first phase of the toll hikes began on Dec. 1, 2008 with 40 percent and 43 percent increases on the Turnpike and the Parkway, respectively. The second phase represents a 53 percent hike on the Turnpike and a 50 percent increase on the Parkway.

The toll increase was initially scheduled to support a $1.25 billion contribution to a Hudson River commuter train tunnel project, known as Access to the Region's Core, or ARC. But citing potential cost overruns, Christie terminated the project in October 2010.

In September, the turnpike authority agreed to redirect $975 million from the canceled tunnel to local road and bridge projects. Those projects are part of a five-year capital plan unveiled by Christie earlier this year.

The increased toll revenue also is going toward the authority’s $7 billion capital program, which includes a Turnpike widening project between exits 6 and 9.

Our ruling

In a radio interview, Christie directed blame for the new toll hikes to his predecessor, claiming ""I'm not raising tolls 50 percent....Jon Corzine did.""

The governor’s planning to spend the money, but he didn’t raise the tolls. With Corzine’s approval, the New Jersey Turnpike Authority approved the two-phase toll increase in October 2008.

John Boehner says the Social Security trust fund faces imminent bankruptcy
","
As 2011 wound down and Congress dickered over extension of a temporary payroll tax cut for 160 million Americans, concerns about the extension cross party lines.

A significant number of Democrats and Republicans argued that cutting that tax,which finances Social Security, will undermine the program.

During the negotiations, House Speaker John Boehner told reporters that the payroll tax cut was an issue on which House Republicans were ready to work with President Obama to find common ground.

""The key question is, how do we pay for it?"" the Ohio Republican said.  ""It's important that the payroll tax cut be paid for because that money is used to fund the Social Security trust fund, which is already facing imminent bankruptcy.""

That drew the notice of PolitiFact Ohio. ""Imminent bankruptcy"" describes a dire situation requiring immediate attention.

We asked Boehner's office for evidence. They referred us to the summary of the annual reports of the Social Security and Medicare trust funds that was issued last spring, and one passage in particular:

""Social Security expenditures exceeded the program's non-interest income in 2010 for the first time since 1983. The $49 billion deficit last year (excluding interest income) and $46 billion projected deficit in 2011 are in large part due to the weakened economy and to downward income adjustments that correct for excess payroll tax revenue credited to the trust funds in earlier years.""

The status report goes on, however: ""Through 2022,"" it says, ""the annual cash deficits will be made up by redeeming trust fund assets from the General Fund of the Treasury. Because these redemptions will be less than interest earnings, trust fund balances will continue to grow. After 2022, trust fund assets will be redeemed in amounts that exceed interest earnings until trust fund reserves are exhausted in 2036, one year earlier than was projected last year. Thereafter, tax income would be sufficient to pay only about three-quarters of scheduled benefits through 2085.""

PolitiFact has been over this ground before.

In recent history, the revenue raised in payroll taxes was more than enough to cover the benefits that Social Security needed to pay out. The excess went into a trust fund, which has now accumulated roughly $2.5 trillion.

That money is not cash sitting in a vault somewhere. The federal government has loaned the money to itself, using the cash to pay for other expenses. The loan is in the form of special-issue Treasury bonds that earned $117.5 billion in interest in 2010, according to the latest trust fund report.

Largely because of the recession, Social Security paid out more in benefits in the last two years than it raised from the payroll tax. To pay benefits in 2010 and 2011, Social Security supplemented money from the payroll tax with interest from the bonds, according to the Social Security Administration.

According to the Social Security and Medicare Trust Fund Reports, interest from the Treasury bonds -- plus revenue from the payroll tax -- will be insufficient to cover the cost of retiree checks in 2022.

Fourteen years later, in 2036, the trust fund itself will be depleted, according to the report. If nothing is done, the only money flowing into Social Security will be the amount raised year-to-year in taxes. That will only cover about 75 percent of benefits through 2085.

How does that add up for Boehner's statement about ""imminent bankruptcy""?

""Imminent"" is defined by the dictionary as ""about to happen.""

""Bankrupt"" is a distinct legal term that means a person, company or government is unable to pay its debts.

There is an element of truth here. Social Security is facing long-term fiscal challenges. But the claim ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

The program is not out of money or unable to pay benefits. At the current pace, according to federal projections, scheduled benefits should continue to be paid in full for about 25 years.

The sky may be darkening, but it is not falling.

On the Truth-O-Meter, Boehner's statement is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/jan/03/john-boehner/john-boehner-says-social-security-trust-fund-faces/

National Park Service director correct that its budget less than budget for Austin's city government
","From the mountains to the valleys and to the oceans, the U.S. government spends less money running parks than Austin devotes to city government, a federal honcho told Congress. Jonathan Jarvis, director of the National Park Service, prefaced his June 14, 2016, mention of Austin with some agency self-celebration, telling the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform: ""The NPS manages many of our nation’s most iconic and beloved landscapes and historic sites. We are responsible for managing more than 400 individual parks with more than 84 million acres of land, stretching from Acadia National Park in the State of Maine to the National Park of American Samoa in the South Pacific. The NPS also manages numerous wild and scenic rivers and national trails; programs that recognize our nation’s historic structures; and programs that help local governments and organizations provide recreational opportunities and protect open space. We are seeing record-breaking visitation -- more than 300 million last year -- and the resulting economic activity created by the parks topped $16 billion."" ""We are accomplishing all of this,"" Jarvis said next, ""on an annual budget that is less than the city of Austin, Texas."" Right off, Jarvis seemed right on the numbers. For the fiscal year that began Oct. 1, 2015, the park service’s budget amounts to $3.4 billion, which folds in $2.85 billion appropriated by Congress plus expected fee revenue, a park service spokesman, Jeff Olson, advised by email. The service has 22,000 employees, he said. Olson, asked how Jarvis came to single out Austin, said that in preparing for the House hearing, Jarvis ""was looking for another government entity's budget with which to compare the NPS."" Jarvis settled on Austin for his comparison after looking online for the budgets of various cities, Olson said. For the same fiscal year, the Austin City Council approved a $3.5 billion budget, according to the published city budget. A city spokesman, David Green, conceded the numerical differences though he indicated that comparing the total budgets obscures vast differences between the federal agency and Austin city government. ""While it is accurate to say Austin’s $3.5 billion budget is larger than that of the National Park Service,"" Green said by email, ""it is difficult to make a direct comparison. The City of Austin has over 13,000 employees spread across more than 40 departments – including our own Water and Electric utilities – that provide daily direct service to more than 900,000 residents. The scope and mission of the city is simply too varied to make an apples-to-apples comparison,"" Green said. Olson, reacting to Green’s analysis, said by email: ""It may be difficult to compare Austin to the NPS. While the city serves 900,000 residents, the NPS serves more than 300 million visitors each year, many of them from Austin, no doubt."" A federal wrinkle? We asked a pro-parks group, the National Parks Conservation Association, about Jarvis’ claim.  By email, spokeswoman Kati Schmidt said association experts pegged the service’s fiscal 2016 budget at $3.377 billion ""after adding appropriated funds plus fees and other mandatory funding."" But Schmidt also illuminated additional money coming to the park service for federal road projects. ""Park service roads also benefit from Highway Trust Fund dollars for maintenance totaling $268 million this year,"" Schmidt wrote. That $268 million would drive up the agency’s total expected 2016 spending to $3.645 billion by our calculation--which would exceed Austin city government’s $3.5 billion budget. But hold on: We ran this thought past the park service’s Olson who said by phone it’s fair to say the additional roads money is being spent by the agency. Yet Olson said by email the $268 million is part of the U.S. Department of Transportation budget. The association’s Schmidt further told us the park service’s ""resources/facilities also benefit at times from a variety of other random smaller sources like state grants and private donations (both monetary and in-kind), but we don’t have any sum total of all funding sources that benefit the"" system. ""These other sources are not technically part of the NPS budget so in terms of Jarvis’ reference to an ‘annual budget,’ indeed the claim appears to be defensible,"" Schmidt said. Citing insufficient knowledge about the city’s budget, Schmidt declined to speculate about whether the director made a fair apples-to-apples comparison. Some differences beyond budget totals It’s worth noting the park service and Austin’s city government draw on divergent revenue sources. Congress, which spends tax revenue, appropriated 84 percent of the park service’s budget. In contrast, just 24 percent of the city’s 2015-16 budget, or $818 million, was penciled in to come from tax revenue. On the other hand, the city budget shows $1.9 billion in revenue from ""utility charges,"" largely meaning income from the sale of electricity, water and wastewater services; that chunk of money covers 54 percent of the city budget. Notably, too, the city has a capital improvements budget supported by debt, grants and fund transfers. In 2015-16, the Austin City Council appropriated $629.6 million for such projects; that amount is not part of the $3.5 billion total budget, city spokeswoman Alicia Dean told us by phone. So, the city plans to spend more than $4 billion in fiscal 2016, counting the regular and capital improvements budgets. Olson told us the park service’s 2016 budget folds in more than $192 million budgeted by the agency for comparable construction and repair/rehabilitation purposes. Put another way, he said, that money is part of the $3.4 billion total budget. Our ruling Jarvis said the National Park Service has an annual budget that is less than the budget for the city of Austin. For the fiscal year through September 2016, this is so by $100 million--though there are arguably plenty of differences between the agency and Austin city government that keep this comparison from meaning a great deal.

Clinton, Trump both say Moody's economist is on the other team
","When respected financial analysis group Moody’s published a blistering report critiquing Donald Trump’s economic proposals, Hillary Clinton jumped on it. ""One of (Republican Sen.) John McCain’s former economic advisers actually calculated what would happen to our country if Trump gets his way. He described the results of a Trump recession. We would lose 3.5 million jobs. Incomes would stagnate. Debt would explode. And stock prices would plummet. And you know who would be hit the hardest? The people who had the hardest time getting back on their feet after the 2008 crisis,"" she said in a June 21 speech. Not so fast, Trump responded. Mark Zandi, Moody’s chief economist and the report’s lead author, actually supports Clinton and President Barack Obama. ""Mark Zandi is an Obama adviser and Clinton donor,"" read the headline of a rapid response email from the Trump campaign. So who is this guy Mark Zandi? Zandi is a well-respected economist, one we have quoted as an expert in previous stories, and politicians and economists on both sides of the aisle like him. His latest report is sharply critical of Trump’s policy proposals, but it is a serious, methodical examination that looks at three possible scenarios: one where Trump’s proposals are adopted in full, one where they are adopted on a smaller scale, and one that envisions a compromise with Congress. (Moody’s says a similar report about Clinton’s proposals is forthcoming.) Though others might take issue with some aspects of Zandi’s findings, the purpose of this fact-check is not to cast doubt on the quality of his Trump report or his work generally. Rather, Clinton is using Zandi’s Republican credentials as a former McCain adviser to make the point that even Republicans think Trump’s proposals would be bad for the economy. But it turns out she is leaving out an important piece of information that leaves a giant hole in that particular line of argument — notably that Zandi has donated the maximum amount of $2,700 to her primary campaign. Beyond this presidential cycle, Zandi has donated to a variety of Democrats going back to 2007. Zandi confirmed to PolitiFact that he is a registered Democrat. In the 2008 presidential race, though, he did support Republican candidate Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. He donated more than $2,000 to McCain’s campaign, and he was one of several economists advising McCain in an official capacity. Zandi was a Democrat back then, too, but he told the Wall Street Journal he is ""eclectic"" and that he has done work for members of both parties, a point he has since reiterated. After the 2008 election, though, Zandi turned out to be an important asset to the Obama administration. Zandi told us he wasn’t an adviser to Obama or the White House, as Trump claimed, but he has produced research concluding the Obama administration’s response to the 2008 financial crisis was a success. And Zandi was on Obama’s short list to regulate the Federal Housing Finance Agency, though he didn’t get the job. We asked Zandi what he would tell people who question whether his report on Trump is neutral, given his sizeable donation to Clinton and past connections with Democrats. ""We used the same model of the economy we use for all our studies,"" he said. ""And the study is completely transparent. Moreover, the approach we took is the same approach the (nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office) takes when evaluating similar fiscal policy proposals. I'm very interested in hearing substantive critiques of our work."" He also noted that one of the other three authors who worked on the report has donated to a Republican candidate this presidential cycle, though we were unable to confirm that point. Our ruling Clinton said that Mark Zandi, who wrote a report criticizing Trump’s economic proposals, is ""one of John McCain's former economic advisers."" Zandi was a donor and adviser to the McCain campaign, but that’s not the full picture of his political affiliations. As it turns out, Zandi is a registered Democrat and donated the maximum amount to Clinton’s primary campaign. Zandi is a well-respected economist, and we are not in this fact-check casting doubt on the credibility of his Trump report or his work generally. He has advised and worked on issues for politicians on both sides of the aisle for many years. But Clinton is invoking Zandi’s name to make the case that even Republicans oppose Trump’s economic proposals, and this argument is nearly hollow.

Clinton: Trump called pregnant employees 'an inconvenience'
","Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton uncorked a torrent of criticism on her opponent, Donald Trump, at a rally in Ohio’s capital city. The premise: what America’s economy would look like with Trump in charge. ""Over the years, he’s said all kinds of things about women in the workforce,"" Clinton said. ""He once called pregnant employees -- and I quote -- ‘an inconvenience.’ "" Clinton went on to say that even she was incredulous that Trump made remarks like the ""inconvenience"" statement, despite assurances from her researchers and speechwriters. We searched for the clip. Trump’s comment stems from a Dateline NBC interview of Trump from 2004. The segment, ""Blonde Ambition,"" was about Carolyn Kepcher, Trump’s Apprentice sidekick and executive vice president of Trump’s golf properties. Kepcher had just released Carolyn 101, a memoir of her business experience. Kepcher describes herself as a straight-shooter, but as her Dateline interviewer points out, that seems to conflict with an anecdote in the book in which Kepcher recounts waiting six months before telling Trump that she was pregnant. ""You were worried that he might feel inconvenienced?"" the reporter asked. ""Maybe, in my mind, he might think perhaps that this might be a setback,"" Kepcher answered. When the piece turned to Trump, he answered a question that the viewers don’t get to hear, due to editing. ""Well you know, pregnancy is never, um -- it’s a wonderful thing for the woman, it’s a wonderful thing for the husband, it’s certainly an inconvenience for a business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business."" Because the viewers don’t hear the question Trump is responding to, and the only other person to use the word ""inconvenience"" was the Dateline reporter, it’s possible that the term may have been introduced as part of the reporter’s question. Studies have shown that the costs of accommodating pregnant employees is minimal. The National Women’s Law Center published a fact sheet in 2012 that pointed out that the accommodations employers already provide for disabled employees are much the same as what pregnant women require, only temporarily. And the positive gains -- better recruitment and retention of workers, boosts in productivity, reductions in absenteeism, better workplace safety -- far outweigh any costs, according to the fact sheet. Trump’s views on pregnancy didn’t sway Kepcher’s admiration for her former boss. ""If there’s one thing I’ve learned from Donald, it’s to make a decision, make it fast, and stick with it,"" she said. Trump certainly didn’t view his daughter Ivanka’s pregnancy as an inconvenience when she stood beside him, well into her third trimester, stumping in New Hampshire and South Carolina. Trump told crowds in both states that he’d love for his daughter to have her baby there. ""You know, she had a baby like five days ago,"" Trump said of Ivanka at a March rally in New York, about 10 days after Ivanka gave birth. ""She did a good job. So I should not say Ivanka, you're fired, right? I promise."" We searched but were unable to find any additional comments made by Trump about women employees becoming pregnant. Our ruling Clinton said that Trump called pregnancy ""an inconvenience"" for business owners. Trump indeed used that word in a 2004 interview with NBC’s Dateline. ""The fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business,"" Trump said. Clinton’s claim is accurate.

More schooling reduces HIV risk. But by how much?
","There are any number of arguments for boosting the education of girls in poorer nations. A person who knows more, regardless of gender, tends to earn more. The children of mothers with more education often do better themselves. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., added another item to the list. At a Senate hearing on June 15, 2016, Kaine said, ""For every extra year that a girl stays in secondary school, her chance of getting infected with HIV/AIDS decreases by half."" As it turns out, Kaine had the general thrust right, but he went too far with the exact numbers. Here’s what the research shows. Botswana gave the world a natural experiment in 1996 when it changed its education policy by adding an extra year — grade 10 — to basic education. Botswana kept good records that covered both who stayed in school and their HIV status in the years that followed. Nearly two decades later, social scientists hopped on all that data. Their 2015 article in the medical journal Lancet found that among girls, the lifetime risk of HIV infection dropped by about one-third -- not one-half. Kaine’s press office cited that Botswana study as the source behind his statement. Looking at some of the wording in the article, we can see why they might read it to say that the risk for women fell by half. But it didn’t. We talked to one of the main researchers, Jacob Bor at Boston University’s School of Public Health, to confirm that it was reduced by one-third. Here’s the key table from that article.  We underlined the key numbers in red. Before the reform, women had a 32.3 percent risk of catching the HIV infection. After getting the extra year of school, that risk came down by 11.6 percentage points, or roughly one-third. We’d also note that Kaine’s statement also parted from the Botswana study in that he talked about ""every extra year that a girl stays in secondary school,"" while the study only had data on a single extra year. To say that the risk fell for every extra year would go far beyond what the research shows. Still, Bor said Kaine has the right idea. ""He’s qualitatively correct, but quantitatively a little bit off,"" Bor said. ""Also, these results are local to the incredibly high HIV prevalence in Botswana and their education reform. If you just parachute-dropped a year of extra schooling in another country, it’s not so clear you’d see the same result."" Two studies out of Uganda also give support to Kaine’s broad concept, if not his actual numbers. Two Harvard researchers reported that between 1990 and 1995, HIV rates fell by about 13 percentage points. During that time, Uganda moved to keep children in school longer. The study said the driving factor was women delayed having sex. ""(Education) policy can explain between one-sixth and one-half of this overall decline,"" the authors wrote in their 2013 article. That is a wide range, but it still shows movement in the direction that Kaine described. About a decade earlier, Damien de Walque, now at the World Bank, looked at 15 villages in Uganda. He and his colleagues found that ""for girls born after 1970, one additional year of education reduced HIV incidence, that is the risk of getting infected with HIV/AIDS, by 21 percent,"" de Walque told us. That was for primary school, not secondary. ""Sen. Kaine’s statement is largely correct that the more additional years of education a girl receives, the less likely it is that she will be infected with HIV,"" de Walque said. Our ruling Kaine said that a woman’s risk of HIV infection fell by half for every extra year of secondary school. That statement goes too far in a couple of ways. The biggest decline in risk that any study found with any precision was about one-third. That’s substantial, but it isn’t half. And Kaine erred in saying that the effect would come with each additional year, when the underlying Botswana study only looked at a single extra year. But in broad terms, leading researchers in the field gave Kaine points for getting the general point correct. More education has an appreciable impact in reducing a woman’s risk of contracting HIV.

What do we know about Hillary Clinton's religion? A lot, actually
","Donald Trump has once again questioned a presidential candidate’s religious affiliation, accusing presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton of shielding her religious preference from the public eye. Speaking prior to a gathering hosted by the conservative Christian activist organization United in Purpose, Trump said there has been no public reference to Clinton’s religion. The comment was captured in a video from E.W. Jackson, a former nominee for Virginia lieutenant governor who attended the gathering. ""We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion,"" Trump said in the video. ""Now, she's been in the public eye for years and years, and yet there's no — there's nothing out there. There’s like nothing out there."" This is not the first time Trump has questioned a candidate’s religion. In 2011, Trump floated the possibility that President Barack Obama, whose path to Christianity is well-documented, could be a Muslim. At the gathering, Trump also made the broader claim that Clinton would not protect religious liberty. ""We can’t be again politically correct and say we pray for all our leaders, because all of your leaders are selling Christianity down the tubes, selling evangelicals down the tubes,"" he said. So, what does Clinton have to say about her religion? A lot, we found out. On the campaign trail Let’s get this out of the way: Clinton is a Methodist, and the record on that is abundantly clear. The Clinton campaign directed us to several news articles where Clinton discussed her religion, including a Jan. 25 campaign rally in Knoxville, Iowa. When asked about her beliefs, Clinton cited her Methodist faith and tied it into her support for the poor, citing the teachings of Jesus. ""Because it sure does seem to favor the poor and the merciful and those who in worldly terms don’t have a lot but who have the spirit that God recognizes as being at the core of love and salvation,"" she said. She went on to criticize those who use Christianity to ""condemn so quickly and judge so harshly."" In February 2016, after the New Hampshire primary, Clinton paraphrased a phrase popular among Methodists and often attributed to John Wesley, founder of the Methodist Church. ""You know, my family and my faith taught me a simple credo — do all the good you can, in all the ways you can, for all the people you can,"" she said. She called upon her personal spirituality during her unsuccessful 2008 bid for president. ""I was raised to pray, you know, as a little girl, you know, saying my prayers at night, saying grace at meals, praying in, you know, church,"" she said at a 2007 presidential forum. Clinton has definitely brought up her religious background on the campaign trail this time around to convey both her political and personal philosophies. However, the intended message has not always hit home with voters. A 2016 Pew poll found that 43 percent of people found Clinton ""not religious"" compared to 60 percent for Trump. A 2008 Pew poll had 31 percent thinking her not religious, 53 percent only somewhat religious. Formative years Religion has played a large role in Clinton’s life even before ""there was any political advantage to do so,"" said Patrick Maney, a Bill Clinton biographer and professor of history at Boston College. Hillary Clinton’s religious upbringing starts around the sixth grade in Park Ridge, Ill., where she attended Bible classes and participated in the Altar Guild at the First United Methodist Church, writes Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Carl Bernstein in his Clinton biography. There, she met Don Jones, a Methodist youth minister who took Clinton under his wing. At Jones’ memorial in 2009, Clinton attributed her pursuit of social justice to Jones’ teaching. ""He taught me the meaning of the words ‘faith in action’ and the importance of social justice and human rights,"" she said at the time. In the conservative community of Park Ridge, Jones was considered to be more liberal and a free thinker, occasionally drawing ire for it. Jones made it a point to teach Clinton how ""Jesus would deal with social issues,"" said William Chafe, a professor of history at Duke University who has studied Clinton extensively. ""He took Hillary and the youth group into the slums of Chicago, had them interact with poor blacks and Puerto Ricans, and brought them to hear (Martin Luther King, Jr.) preach,"" Chafe said. ""Even though her father was a Goldwater Republican."" Jones was eventually asked to leave by members of the community, notably one of Clinton’s teachers Paul Carlson, who found his teachings too radical. The disagreements they had informed her shift in political philosophy, Clinton wrote in her 2003 autobiography Living History. ""Though my eyes were opening, I still mostly parroted the conventional wisdom of Park Ridge’s and my father’s politics,"" she wrote. ""While Don Jones threw me into ‘liberalizing’ experiences, Paul Carlson … reinforced my already strong anti-communist views."" Her critics have actually used her relationship with Jones against her as a ""radicalizing influence,"" Maney said. However, even after leaving for Wellesley College, the two kept in touch. ""I wonder if it's possible to be a mental conservative and a heart liberal,"" she wrote Jones in a letter, reflecting on her changing political ideology and its religious influences. Conservative historian Paul Kengor, author of the book God and Hillary Clinton, told PolitiFact that Clinton has deviated from recent Methodist doctrine on abortion and gay marriage. The United Methodist Church recently voted in May on actions to the contrary of Clinton’s views on those topics — withdrawing from a pro-choice group and choosing not to alter its stance on gay marriage. ""I think abortion should remain legal, but it needs to be safe and rare,"" she said at a 2008 forum commenting on how her Methodist tradition has complicated the issue. Kengor said in an interview with Christianity Today hat Clinton ""walks step by step with the Methodist leadership into a very liberal Christianity.""   She continued to attend church at Wellesley, and Chafe noted that her social justice pursuits meshed with her religious convictions once she got to Yale as well. ""She immediately identified with Marion Wright Edelman's Children's Defense Fund at Yale and worked with them after graduating from Yale,"" Chafe said. The group advocated for family rights. The trend continues after moving to Arkansas in the 1970s, where she taught Sunday school at the First United Methodist Church, Maney said. Clinton also attended the Foundry United Methodist Church in Washington as first lady. Kengor told PolitiFact she was considered a ""regular"" at the church, which is considered to be more liberal than the larger Methodist denomination. Bill Clinton is a Baptist, not a Methodist. Hillary Clinton’s daughter, Chelsea, was raised a Methodist. In her own words Clinton has said that ""advertising"" her faith publicly is not her first instinct. Chafe noted she has relied on it less extensively in the recent past. Nonetheless, she has expounded on her faith in several public comments and books since entering the national spotlight with the election of her husband as president in 1992. ""Bill and I went into our bedroom, closed the door and prayed together for God’s help as he took on this awesome honor and responsibility,"" Clinton wrote in Living History of her husband winning the 1992 election. In the same book, she describes meeting her ""prayer partners"" at the 1993 National Prayer Breakfast, and the gifts of Scripture they provided her. ""Of all the thousands of gifts I received in my eight years in the White House, few were more welcome and needed than these 12 intangible gifts of discernment, peace, compassion, faith, fellowship, vision, forgiveness, grace, wisdom, love, joy and courage,"" she wrote. Her first book — It Takes A Village: And Other Lessons Children Teach Us — published in 1996, includes a section devoted to Clinton’s religious affiliation, ""Children are Born Believers."" In the chapter, she marvels about children’s potential to grasp spiritual issues and cites it as reason to defend religious freedom. ""We are only children of God, not God. Therefore, we must not attempt to fit God into little boxes, claiming that He supports this or that political position,"" she wrote. References to Clinton’s faith surfaced in 1998, when news of Bill Clinton’s affair with Monica Lewinsky hit the press, and in 2000 when she campaigned for the U.S. Senate. In 2014, Clinton spoke to United Methodist Women, citing the Methodist Church as inspiring her to ""advocate for children and families, for women and men around the world who are oppressed and persecuted, denied their human rights and human dignity."" ""I’ll always cherish the Methodist Church because it gave us the great gift of personal salvation, but the great obligation of social gospel, and for me, having faith, hope, and love in action was exactly what we were called to do,"" she said. Our ruling Trump said, ""We don't know anything about Hillary in terms of religion."" The reality is we were able to find quite a lot about Clinton’s Methodist upbringing and beliefs, and how she says it ties into her political philosophy. We documented just some of what we found here, and experts agree there is more out there. Trump’s statement is inaccurate and ridiculous.

The Kenney Administration and the thorny problem of diversity in city government
","Mayor Jim Kenney boasted of his administration’s diversity numbers at the Better Bike Share Conference in Philadelphia Thursday. Clarena Tolson, deputy managing director of the Office of Transportation and Infrastructure (oTIS) had just given well received remarks to introduce the mayor. When addressing the crowd, seemingly in reference to Tolson, he said, ""I have some advice for anyone who wants to be successful in their career: Hire and promote smart women. Because they’ll get it done. ""We went about doing that in the beginning of the administration through [the] transition. We are well represented both racially, ethnically and gender-wise."" Kenney has received both good and bad attention for his hiring. A month into his administration, Philadelphia Magazine noted that 55 percent of his appointees were women. The magazine also reported that 34 percent his appointees were people of color. Does that mean it’s diverse? There are multiple ways we could measure diversity in the Kenney administration. Using this organizational chart as a basis, PolitiFact PA estimates at least 60 percent of the administration’s top brass is white, while some 50 percent are women. Exempt employees making more than $90,000, according to the city, are 61 percent white. Reacting to demographics for certain city departments, Council President Darrell Clarke called racial representation across execs ""clearly problematic"" during a budget hearing. City employees overall are 57 percent of color. (Philadelphia demographically is 44 percent black, 14 percent Hispanic, seven percent Asian, one percent Native American or Pacific Islander, and 34 percent white.) The disparity between the racial makeup between high-level employees versus the overall workforce predates Kenney’s term. Philly.com analysis found that in 2015, 64 percent of Nutter adminstration staffers making more than $85,000 were white, comparable to the current admistration’s numbers. This issue is by no means unique to Philadelphia. Kenney is among a recent wave of American mayors tackling this City Hall hiring gap with new tactics, perhaps following the lead of Boston’s Marty Walsh, Pittsburgh’s Bill Peduto, and former Seattle Mayor Greg Nickels. Kenney appointed the city’s first Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, Nolan Atkinson, whom he named before taking office. Many observers might say that the disparity needs closer examination. (Kenney’s spokeswoman Lauren Hitt said as much before the mayor’s swearing-in, in an email to Billy Penn last November.) Advocates and politicians have pointed to hiring practices and a less-than-ideal pipeline that’s not tracking candidates of color for the top jobs. Also of interest: according to Philadelphia Magazine, 57 percent of Kenney’s appointees, ""at least,"" had worked in the previous administration. ""[T]he City has some complicated, underlying barriers to racial and gender diversity, which the Mayor has acknowledged on multiple occasions,"" Mike Dunn, another city spokesperson, said in an email. ""It’s why he created the position of the Chief Diversity and Inclusion Officer, so that is one office’s full time responsibility to address these barriers in a systemic, focused way."" Dunn mentioned that Pew is currently studying their workforce diversity, looking into policy fixes and best practices. ""The outcome of the study will likely lead to changes made by the City to make city employment more representative of the population,"" Dunn wrote.   Our ruling Kenney said his administration was ""well-represented both racially, ethnically and gender-wise."" Philadelphia is the only major city where women constitute the majority of workers. It’s a slight majority, and that’s close to what Kenney’s administration looks like. This is something for which Kenney has been celebrated. The other categories in his comment are another story, though. Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto gets praise— his administration has been called Pittsburgh’s most diverse ever— for appointing a comparable percentage of blacks. But Pittsburgh is about two thirds white. Philadelphia is roughly two thirds of color. The Kenney administration’s numbers racially aren’t representative of Philadelphia. Sixty-one percent of the city’s top earners are white. While African-Americans are underrepresented, Asians and Latinos are even more so: Four percent of employees paid more than $90,000 are Hispanic; another four percent are Asian. In the city’s population as a whole, those two groups represent more than 2.5 times that.

Hillary Clinton: Pregnancy-related deaths dropped after Roe vs. Wade legalized abortion
","Hillary Clinton says her opponent Donald Trump wants to take the country back to a time that was bad for women’s reproductive health. ""When Donald Trump says ‘let’s make America great again,’ that is code for ‘let’s take America backward.’ Back to a time when opportunity and dignity were reserved for some, not all,"" she said in June 10 remarks at a Planned Parenthood event. ""Back to the days when abortion was illegal, women had far fewer options, and life for too many women and girls was limited. Well, Donald, those days are over."" Clinton went on to note significant moments in history for women’s health, notably the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion, Roe vs. Wade. ""So young women were no longer dying in emergency rooms and back alleys from botched, illegal abortions,"" she said. ""And this is a fact that is not often heard, but I hope you will repeat it: America’s maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically."" We decided to look into Clinton’s factoid: that Roe vs. Wade resulted in a decreased number of women dying as a result of pregnancy complications. Maternal mortality rates, which are the number of deaths per 100,000 live births, were already declining rapidly in the years prior to the January 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision, according to the Vital Statistics of the United States, maintained by the Centers for Disease Control. This is also true looking just at mortality rates related to abortion. In 1965, about 32 women for every 100,000 live births died as a result of pregnancy complications, including abortions. It fell steadily every year leading up to Roe in 1973, when the rate was 15.2. The rate continued to decrease in the years after, to 9.6 in 1979.  You can see in the graph that there is a slightly bigger drop than previous years in maternal mortality rates between 1972 and 1973, during which the Supreme Court decided Roe. The same pattern is visible for abortion-related deaths, with a rate of 6.3 in 1965, falling to fewer than 1 in the years after Roe. Both overall maternal mortality and abortion mortality were declining in the years leading up to Roe due to better antibiotics, blood banks and other medical advancements, said David Grimes, a clinical professor in obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine. However, the decline in abortion related-deaths accelerated when abortion started to become legal. It’s also worth noting that before abortion became legal, the number of abortions — and thus the number of abortion-related deaths — were likely underreported. While Roe is a focal point, the decline in maternal mortality as a result of legalized abortion took place over about a decade — from the time states began to legalize abortion on their own in 1966 to when the rest transitioned to complying with the Supreme Court ruling in the late 1970s, said Johanna Schoen, an expert in reproductive rights history and professor at Rutgers University. By the time the court decided Roe in 1973, New York, Alaska, Hawaii and Washington legalized abortion in nearly all cases, while about 13 other states legalized it in some cases, such as in the case of rape or incest. Legalizing abortion gave medical professionals the okay to conduct the procedure out in the open and to research safer methods, which helped bring overall maternal mortality rates down. So not only were women moving from less-safe illegal abortions to legal ones, the legal abortions were becoming safer. In fact, receiving an abortion now carries a lower mortality risk than moving forward with a pregnancy. ""With the legalization of abortion and the simultaneous introduction of medical equipment to perform first trimester abortions with vacuum aspiration machines, a previously clandestine and dangerous procedure became safe, quick, and inexpensive almost overnight,"" Schoen wrote in her book, Abortion after Roe. The fact that legalizing abortion was able to affect overall maternal mortality rates is a testament to how many women were having abortions at the time, Schoen told PolitiFact. In a stark turn of events, maternal mortality rates are currently on the rise in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control. This sets the United States apart from its peer countries, which have generally seen continued declines.  Researchers hypothesize that the increase has to do with women getting pregnant while suffering from a chronic illness like diabetes, more women giving birth via higher-risk cesarean sections, or hospitals are getting better at reporting maternal deaths. Our ruling As a result of Roe vs. Wade, ""America’s maternal mortality rate dropped dramatically.""   Rates of women dying as a result of pregnancy complications were already on the decline when the Supreme Court decided Roe vs. Wade. But experts told us that a primary reason behind this trend was legalizing abortion nationwide, which took place over a decade, with Roe as a focal point. So Roe solidified this improvement in maternal mortality rates.

Is there a Second Amendment right to semiautomatic rifles?
","Meet the Press host Chuck Todd did a double-take after House Speaker Paul Ryan made a claim about semiautomatic rifles, which was the type of gun used in the mass shooting in Orlando days earlier. ""I grew up hunting with Remington 7400s, which are semiautomatic rifles. Cosmetically they look different, they function exactly the same,"" the Wisconsin Republican said on the June 19, 2016 edition of the show. ""So, look, we can go into all of these issues other than to say, people have a constitutional right to bear arms. People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles."" Todd then interrupted Ryan, saying: ""There’s nothing in the Second Amendment that says you have a right for a semiautomatic. You can regulate."" Ryan agreed that the government can put restrictions on guns. But what about his statement? Do Americans have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles? Five experts we consulted agreed that Ryan was generally on target -- though, as University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck put it, ""there’s a ton of nuance behind"" his statement. 2008 case key Automatic rifles, which fire continuously when the trigger is pressed, are essentially banned by federal law. Semiautomatics -- which reload automatically but fire only once each time the trigger is depressed -- are not banned, though some states do impose restrictions on them. To check Ryan’s claim, we spoke with four law professors who are experts on gun law: Vladeck; Nicholas Johnson of Fordham University; Robert Spitzer of State University of New York-Cortland; and Adam Winkler at UCLA in Los Angeles. We also spoke to Adam Bates, a criminal justice policy analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. The Second Amendment to the U.S. Constitution -- ""the right of the people to keep and bear arms"" -- was passed by Congress in 1789 and ratified two years later. So, it does not, of course, explicitly declare a right to have a semiautomatic rifle, a version of which wasn’t invented until about a century later. The U.S. Supreme Court also has not explicitly declared a constitutional right to semiautomatic rifles. But semiautomatic rifles, as Ryan suggested with his reference to a hunting rifle, have been widely owned and commonly used for generations. The courts have allowed states to put restrictions on such rifles, but they have long been a legal firearm. All of the experts cited a 2008 U.S. Supreme Court decision in what is known as the Heller case, the high court’s first decision interpreting the Second Amendment since 1939. In a 5-4 ruling, the court said the Second Amendment confers an individual right to possess a firearm for traditionally lawful purposes such as self-defense. Key excerpts of the decision, which was written by the late Justice Antonin Scalia: The Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home ....  it connotes an individual right to keep and bear arms.  Like most rights, the Second Amendment right is not unlimited. It is not a right to keep and carry any weapon whatsoever in any manner whatsoever and for whatever purpose. Heller was a handgun case. But each of the experts told us that the decision has been read to includes semiautomatic rifles as being among guns protected by the Second Amendment -- and that any attempt to ban them (not restrict them) would very likely be ruled unconstitutional. Our rating Ryan said: ""People have a constitutional right to have semiautomatic rifles."" The U.S. Supreme Court decision has not explicitly declared that Americans have a constitutional right to semiautomatic rifles. And states can, within certain parameters, put restrictions on those guns. But generally speaking, experts told us, semiautomatic rifles are a legal weapon that fall under the Second Amendment right to keep and bear arms.

Did Ron Johnson call “The Lego Movie” an anti-business conspiracy?
","It’s not every day a U.S. Senate election includes conspiracy claims over an animated children’s movie and a staffer dispatched to visit an opponent dressed as ""Lord Business."" It felt like something we should check out. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, took hits from bloggers in May 2015 after criticizing ""The Lego Movie"" for pushing an anti-business message. Amid a contentious election that could swing the balance of power in the Senate, challenger Russ Feingold has repeatedly revisited Johnson’s statements, including June 3, 2016, at the state Democratic Party convention in Green Bay. Amid one of many reminders that he had visited all 72 Wisconsin counties, Feingold said this: ""Something else I didn’t hear around the state is that, as Sen. Johnson said, that ‘The Lego Movie’ — he said this — that ‘The Lego Movie’ is an insidious, anti-business conspiracy. I didn’t hear that. My grandkids don’t even think that."" Did a sitting U.S. senator claim Hollywood is in cahoots with anti-business forces elsewhere to bring their insidious doctrine to the masses? What Johnson said ""The Lego Movie"" — which was released in February 2014 and brought in almost $500 million worldwide — follows the exploits of an extraordinarily average Lego construction worker named Emmet. The Washington Post described him as ""an unthinking worshipper at the consumerist temples that President Business has erected to distract his citizens from Business’ evil plan to freeze them into a state of perfection."" In short, President Business — later revealed to be the sinister Lord Business — is trying to glue all the Legos together to keep everything in its proper place, and Emmet and his team of master builders want to maintain freedom and creativity. We eventually learn the plot stems from the imagination of a young boy playing with Legos belonging to his businessman father, who plans to, yes, glue them together to keep everything in its proper place. So what did Johnson say? From March to May 2015 he commented on the movie in various forums including comments to the Eau Claire Leader-Telegram and Wispolitics.com, a small group in Cedarburg and in a since-deleted blog post on his official Senate site. In the various comments, Johnson made multiple references to leftist control of education and the media and repeatedly referred to ""The Lego Movie"" as anti-business, though not in those direct words. As WisPolitics.com, phrased it in a May 28, 2015, post, Johnson ""lamented what he called a ‘cultural attitude’ that ‘government is good and business is bad,’ giving as an example the animated ‘Lego’ movie, in which the villain is called ‘Lord Business.’ ""That's done for a reason,"" Johnson told the site. ""They're starting that propaganda, and it's insidious."" Johnson noted in his blog post the same day that his comments were inspired by a Wall Street Journal column criticizing the anti-business tone of the movie. So Johnson clearly called the movie ‘insidious’ and implied it was anti-business, but there’s no conspiracy claim. (Merriam-Webster defines a conspiracy as ""a secret plan made by two or more people to do something that is harmful or illegal."") When questioned on the ""conspiracy"" claim, Feingold’s campaign provided a dozen links to stories on Johnson and ""The Lego Movie,"" but no evidence that Johnson had called it a conspiracy. A Feingold spokesman noted only that Johnson mentioned the movie to the Leader-Telegram two days after describing to the U.S. Chamber of Commerce how ""the radical left"" controls the university system, education system, news media, entertainment media and ""more and more of our courts."" The coverage of that talk also did not include any more direct reference to a conspiracy. And the conspiracy claim was notably absent when Feingold’s campaign hammered Johnson on ""The Lego Movie"" several weeks before the Democratic convention speech. The campaign issued a news release May 14 and even sent a press assistant to Johnson’s Milwaukee office dressed as Lord Business, asserting he and Johnson were friends. The character offered to endorse the senator if he supported the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade agreement backed by the Obama administration. Is the movie anti-business? As long as we’re on the topic, are Johnson and other commentators right to call the movie anti-business? However you summarize the plot, it is a feature-length piece of product placement, which seems a curious frame for anti-business propaganda. And while being ""anti-business"" is an opinion, it’s worth noting the creators at least didn’t intend it that way. Philip Lord, who co-wrote and co-directed the movie, described it as an ""anti-totalitarian film for children. Something that was talking about the importance of freedom and innovation in keeping society honest."" When asked to respond on Twitter to the anti-business claims last year, Lord said: ""Art deserves many interpretations, even wrong ones."" Our rating Feingold told a hall full of Democrats that his opponent called ""The Lego Movie"" an ""insidious, anti-business conspiracy."" Johnson used the word ""insidious"" to describe the movie on multiple occasions and repeatedly referred to it as anti-business, though not in so many words. But Feingold is wrong on the boldest and most significant part of the claim. A conspiracy implies a specific fact – that some great hidden hand or collusion is at work to indoctrinate the masses. And it’s something Johnson never said. We rate Feingold’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2016/jun/24/russ-feingold/did-ron-johnson-call-lego-movie-anti-business-cons/

Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton would create 'totally open borders'
","While Donald Trump vows to build a wall between the United States and Mexico to keep undocumented immigrants out, he says Hillary Clinton has the opposite approach. ""She’s pledged to grant mass amnesty, and in her first 100 days, end virtually all immigration enforcement and thus create totally open borders for the United States, totally open borders,"" Trump said in a June 22 speech. Claiming that Clinton would create ""totally open borders"" is a serious charge that suggests allowing people to travel freely or with very few restrictions between two countries.  That’s not what Clinton has proposed. Clinton has supported legislation that includes a path to citizenship (with conditions) and included heightened border security. As a candidate, she says she will focus on deportations of criminals. However, some experts argue that ""open borders"" doesn't necessarily mean no enforcement at all but making it far easier for undocumented immigrants to stay here. Clinton does want to make it easier for many undocumented immigrants, but that’s not the same as getting rid of enforcement. We emailed a Trump spokeswoman twice and did not hear back. Clinton’s immigration platform So if Clinton hasn’t called for ""open borders,"" what does she want to do on immigration? During this campaign, she has called for addressing immigration laws including a path to citizenship within her first 100 days. But she has also called for protecting borders and deporting criminals or those who pose threats. ""We need to secure our borders, I’m for it, I voted for it, I believe in it, and we also need to deal with the families, the workers who are here, who have made contributions, and their children,"" she said in November. ""We can do more to secure our border and we should do more to deal with the 11 or 12 million people who are here, get them out of the shadows."" This is pretty consistent with her view as a senator and secretary of state. As a senator, Clinton supported changing immigration laws, including supporting immigration bills in 2004, 2006 and 2007, and she co-sponsored the Dream Act, an effort to help young people who emigrated illegally as children avoid deportation. In her 2014 book Hard Choices, Clinton praised the 2013 immigration bill, which included billions for border enforcement over a decade for new surveillance equipment and fencing along the Mexican border, as well as adding 20,000 border agents. Clinton’s immigration platform does not amount to open borders, said Alex Nowrasteh, an immigration expert at the libertarian Cato Institute. Open borders existed before 1875, when there were no federal restrictions on emigrating to the country, he said. The United States had immigration restrictions from 1875 to 1924 without a border patrol, which was created in 1924. ""Trump may be conflating the term ‘open borders’ with anything less than perfect enforcement of our immigration laws -- which would be a serious rhetorical error on his part,"" Nowrasteh said. ""Trump can’t claim Clinton is for open borders while she has also supported massive increases in border security to better enforce our restrictive immigration laws."" Clinton has said she wants to limit deportations to violent criminals, not deport children and end raids and round-ups and go further than Obama for DREAMers and their parents if legally possible. That greatly expands who could avoid deportation in a Clinton White House. Those policies amount to less enforcement to supporters of reduced immigration, including Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, and Roy Beck, executive director of NumbersUSA. ""This really is a breathtaking step toward open borders,"" Krikorian told the Washington Post after the March 9 Miami debate. ""If you take that step, it needs to be put in front of the public: Do you think immigration laws are irrelevant unless the illegal immigrant has committed a violent offense or drug crime?"" Beck said the term ""open borders"" is imprecise. However, if undocumented immigrants can ""stay as long as you don’t commit a violent crime, that is pretty close to open borders. You don’t have to give amnesty -- you can just not have a threat of deportation and it allows people to stay."" Clinton’s aim to reform immigration laws and focus on deporting criminals is not the same as ending enforcement and creating open borders, said David Leopold, past president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Trump also fails to acknowledge that Clinton has supported legislation with border patrol measures. ""Proposing immigration legislation is a far cry from mass amnesty, and it’s generally accepted that any immigration reform proposal will include background checks, an English requirement, back taxes and fines,"" he said. Our ruling Trump said Clinton’s immigration platform would ""create totally open borders."" This is a huge distortion of Clinton’s proposals. Clinton has praised work already done to secure the border, and she said she supported a 2013 bill that would have invested billions more in border security while creating a path to citizenship for some undocumented immigrants. Her plan calls for protecting the border and targeting deportation to criminals and security threats. Her plan would make it easier for many undocumented immigrants to avoid deportation, but that’s not the same as ending all enforcement.

Donald Trump flubs claim that Hillary Clinton deleted her support of trade deal from her book
","Donald Trump accused Hillary Clinton of trying to delete part of her personal history during a June 22, 2016, speech that focused in part on the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. Clinton tried to promote the deal as President Barack Obama’s secretary of state, but she withdrew her support for the 12-nation pact in October 2015 amid sharp criticism from Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders. In his speech, Donald Trump took credit for getting her to change her mind and accused her of trying to cover up her support. ""Hillary Clinton has also been the biggest promoter of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which will ship millions more of our jobs overseas — and give up congressional power to an international foreign commission,"" Trump said. ""Now, because I have pointed out why it would be such a disastrous deal, she is pretending that she is against it. ""She has even deleted this record of total support from her book,"" he said, adding, ""deletion is something she is very good at,"" a reference to the tens of thousands of emails she deleted on her home internet server. Did Hillary Clinton actually censor her own book to hide her past support for the trade agreement that has since come under fire? We contacted the Trump campaign asking for its facts to back up the claim. They didn't respond to our query. For starters, there is no evidence that any of Trump's comments have influenced Clinton's thoughts on the treaty. As for the treaty itself, Clinton offered support for it in 2012, long before the deal was finalized. She hailed the deal as ""setting the gold standard"" during a 2012 speech in Australia, to name just one example. She now says she was, at the time, trying to sell the deal to U.S. allies as a member of the Obama administration. The deal was reached in October 2015, well after Clinton departed as secretary of state, and signed the following the February. During her debates with Sanders, Clinton said she had waited until the deal was actually negotiated before ultimately deciding to oppose it. Because of her early supportive comments, we rated her statement Half True. So what, if anything, did she say about the deal in her book Hard Choices? The book was published in June 2014, with a deal still more than a year away. On pages 77 and 78 of hardcover edition, she said the deal ""would link markets throughout Asia and the Americas, lowering trade barriers while raising standards on labor, the environment, and intellectual property."" Clinton also refers to it as ""important for American workers, who would benefit from competing on a more level playing field. And it was a strategic initiative that would strengthen the position of the United States in Asia."" ""Because TPP negotiations are still ongoing, it makes sense to reserve judgment until we can evaluate the final proposed agreement,"" she wrote, echoing the stance she would take when Sanders criticized her support for the deal. ""It’s safe to say that the TPP won’t be perfect—no deal negotiated among a dozen countries ever will be—but its higher standards, if implemented and enforced, should benefit American businesses and workers."" So how much of this did Clinton delete from the paperback edition, which the publisher says was trimmed to accommodate the smaller size? Nothing. The pages are now renumbered as 69 and 70, but the content is the same. We found one reference to the TPP that was cut. Here it is from page 254, in a chapter dealing with Latin American issues: So we worked hard to improve and ratify trade agreements with Colombia and Panama and encouraged Canada and the group of countries that became known as the Pacific Alliance -- Mexico, Colombia, Peru, and Chile -- all open-market democracies driving toward a more prosperous future to join negotiations with Asian nations on TPP, the trans-Pacific trade agreement. The Alliance stood in stark contrast to Venezuela, with its more authoritarian policies and state-controlled economy. That's a description of trying to get other countries involved, not a ringing endorsement. Finally, Clinton came out in opposition to the deal after it was finalized in October 2015. By then, the paperback had been out for six months. Our ruling Trump said Hillary Clinton ""has even deleted this record of total support (for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement) from her book."" The paperback removed a small reference to the TPP but the two pages that talked about it and why the agreement was important weren't deleted. The paperback edition continues to have text expressing support for the trade deal. Anyone who compares the hardcover and paperback versions of the book can see that the claim is ridiculous.

Did Google adjust its autocomplete algorithm to hide Hillary Clinton's problems?
","Is America’s most popular search engine trying to make us forget about Hillary Clinton’s email woes? The hosts of Fox & Friends explored this angle in a June 16, 2016, segment that started with a video clip contrasting autocomplete predictions for searching ""Hillary Clinton cri"" on Google, Yahoo and Bing. After watching the video, which was from a website called SourceFed, Fox News’ chief judicial analyst Andrew Napolitano accused Google of hiding Clinton’s problems. ""The clip that we just ran is the result of a very extensive test, an examination, about whether or not attempts to find things like, ‘crime,’ ‘criminal activity,’ ‘indictment,’ have been filtered out by Google, and we know that it has,"" Napolitano said. We wanted to find out for ourselves if Google manipulates search suggestions in favor of Clinton. Napolitano did not return emails seeking comment. The SourceFed video, posted on YouTube June 9, shows how certain terms, when searched with Clinton’s name, don’t autocomplete as suggestions underneath the search bar. For example, when users search ""Hillary Clinton cri,"" the suggested searches are ""Hillary Clinton crime reform,"" ""Hillary Clinton crisis,"" ""Hillary Clinton criticizes obama 2008"" and so on. No suggestions for ""Hillary Clinton crime"" itself.  However, Bing and Yahoo bring up ""crimes"" and related returns when you search ""Hillary Clinton cri.""    What’s going on? Searching for the truth SourceFed clarified its original video with another one June 10, which included comment from Google denying the accusation. CNN Money also put its two-cents in the mix, saying Google’s algorithm was set up to filter-out offensive information. In a statement, a Google spokesperson says the filter ""operates according to the same rules, no matter who the person is."" ""The autocomplete algorithm is designed to avoid completing a search for a person’s name with terms that are offensive or disparaging,"" the statement says. ""We made this change a while ago following feedback that Autocomplete too often predicted offensive, hurtful or inappropriate queries about people."" The statement linked to a Vox article that refutes the idea Google is manipulating autocomplete in favor of Hillary Clinton. The article says that most people who are accused of crimes but were not convicted will not show up in suggestions. We wanted to test Vox’s theory, so we searched ""Casey Anthony cri"" and ""George Zimmerman cri."" Both were suspects in criminal murder investigations and were acquitted. The autocomplete yielded no suggestions.    We wanted to try other presidential candidates and common allegations against them. When we searched ""Donald Trump fraud,"" no suggestions came up. When we searched ""Bernie Sanders communist,"" two suggestions appeared, but only when we spelled out ""communist."" ""Bernie Sanders arrest"" didn’t yield any results either.      A search of ‘Donald Trump rac’ does yield arguably offensive suggestions.  Experts told PolitiFact that Google’s autocomplete algorithm is not out-of-the ordinary for popular search engines. ""Google is the market leader among search engines by far, so its actions have a much larger impact than those of other search engines,"" said Susan Worst, a lecturer in computer science at Boston University said. ""That it would be leading the way in modifying its autocomplete algorithm is not unusual at all."" Worst cited an instance last year when Google made corrections to its algorithms after its photo recognition project delivered racist results to users. For many years, autocomplete algorithms were based on what others have typed in the past, but the possibility of Google changing its algorithm to detect offensive term suggestions isn’t that surprising, said Marti Hearst, a professor at the University of California at Berkeley School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. She said major search engines update algorithms frequently to assimilate to the ""changing online environment."" ""Algorithms have to be clever to show the best few choices, according to very complex measures of ‘best,' "" Hearst said. ""No doubt there are filters for curse words, and as time has gone by and the tenor of our times are getting more divisive, I would not be surprised if an algorithm has been developed to detect terms that feel offensive to a large segment of the population."" Our ruling Napolitano accused America's most popular search engine, Google, of scrubbing search suggestions in favor of Clinton. Although it is clear Google’s algorithm is different from Bing or Yahoo, it still isn’t correct to describe the difference as evidence of Google’s support of Clinton. Google’s suggested searches, for the most part, avoid offensive suggestions for everyone, not just Clinton.   Napolitano’s claim has a thread of truth, but it leaves out key details that would give the reader a different impression. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/4b442b95-e20a-4768-babf-61ed5ba7062f",/factchecks/2016/jun/23/andrew-napolitano/did-google-adjust-its-autocomplete-algorithm-hide-/
"['History', 'Crime', 'Texas', 'Steve Adler']","
Steve Adler wrong that first U.S. 'mass shooting' occurred in Austin
","Austin’s mayor struck a grim historical note when asked if he could help people understand the June 2016 shooting rampage that took 49 lives in a gay club in Orlando. ""For me it’s beyond understanding,"" Steve Adler replied on KOKE-FM’s morning program a couple of days after the carnage. ""It’s the kind of thing that could happen anywhere, though. You know,"" Adler said, ""Austin was ... the site of the first mass shooting in the country, from that tower, that was the very first one."" Adler was referring to the Aug. 1, 1966, acts of University of Texas student Charles Whitman, whose shots from atop UT’s iconic Main Building ultimately took 14 lives, wounding 31; he’d earlier stabbed to death his wife and mother. Whitman’s fusillade ended when he was shot and killed at short range. KOKE host Bob Cole followed up, asking Adler if he was saying Whitman represented ""the first mass shooting in our country."" ""That’s what I’m told,"" Adler replied. ""First one."" No doubt, Whitman holds broad significance. Texas author Gary Lavergne’s 1997 book, ""A Sniper in the Tower: The Charles Whitman Murders,"" says: ""With deadly efficiency, he introduced America to public mass murder, and in the process forever changed our notions of safety in open spaces."" Before 1966, Lavergne wrote, ""mass murder was so rare that the"" criminal justice ""system had no special category or documentation for it. Statistics and prosecutors had treated such criminals and their crimes in the same manner as a single murder."" However, mass shootings take in far more events than Adler acknowledged, making this Austin-was-first statement incorrect. Adler spokesman concedes error Mayoral spokesman Jason Stanford owned up to error when we inquired into the basis of Adler’s statement. By email, Stanford said he’d given the mayor the ""first mass shooting"" conclusion based on what he’d personally heard since moving to Austin in the 1990s. Next, we looked at news stories fetched from electronic archives, finding that the Austin American-Statesman didn’t deem Whitman the nation’s first mass shooter, at least in recent decades. Rather, a July 1991 American-Statesman news story called the day’s events ""one of the worst mass killings in American history."" Later in 1991, the Associated Press recapped the death of Richard Speck, who ""shocked the nation in 1966 by stabbing and strangling eight student nurses"" in a night. That story quoted James Alan Fox, then dean of Northeastern University’s College of Criminal Justice, saying the Speck slayings marked the start of America's ""age of mass murder. Mass murder was not something that was in our vocabulary until Richard Speck,"" Fox said. Whitman, the story noted, fired from the UT Tower two weeks after the Speck murders. Defining mass shootings That story's mention of Fox prompted us to seek the professor’s analysis of Adler’s statement. By phone, Fox reminded us that a mass shooting has conventionally been defined as one involving four or more deaths by gunfire, not counting military operations or shoot-outs connected to gang activity or other crimes, all in the same one-day period--a definition he sticks with, he said, for the sake of comparisons over time. That definition is in keeping with a 2008 FBI report stating that over the previous three decades, a mass murder was defined as four or more murders occurring during the same incident, with no distinctive time period between the murders--though later, a 2012 law set the federal threshold for a ""mass killing""  as three or more people killed, we noted in a January 2016 fact check. Yet there’s room for other definitions and a narrower term. By email, Fox noted a Stanford University database of U.S. mass shootings launched after the 2012 Sandy Hook shootings. The Stanford project advises: ""Instead of limiting our data collection to incidents in which four or more fatalities occurred (the previous FBI definition for mass murder), we instead collect incidents of three or more shooting victims (not necessarily fatalities). All mass shooting definitions are arbitrary in that there is no natural way to quantify such an event."" In June 2016, Stanford’s database, which chronologically starts with the Whitman shootings, listed more than 300 incidents fulfilling its ""mass shooting"" definition, most recently an April 2016 drive-by incident in Missouri that left four people injured. Mass public shootings To our inquiries, Fox and Grant Duwe, author of a book on mass murder in the U.S. and director of research and evaluation for the Minnesota Department of Corrections, each noted another term with a slightly different definition--""mass public shootings."" A 2013 Congressional Research Service report defined such shootings as ""incidents occurring in relatively public places, involving four or more deaths—not including the shooter(s)—and gunmen who select victims somewhat indiscriminately."" Whitman, Fox suggested to us, accounted for the first mass public shooting on a college campus and the largest to that time. A memorable previous public mass shooting, Fox said, occurred in September 1949 when Howard Unruh shot and killed 13 people, including three children, in a 20-minute stroll through his neighborhood in Camden, N.J., according to Unruh’s October 2009 obituary in the New York Times. Duwe said in an October 2014 article in Reason that he’d identified 161 U.S. mass public shootings since 1900, ""which I've defined as incidents that occur in the absence of other criminal activity (e.g., robberies, drug deals, gang ‘turf wars,’ et cetera) in which a gun was used to kill four or more victims at a public location within a 24-hour period."" And from 1900 until Whitman acted, Duwe told us by phone, there were 30 U.S. public mass shootings. His break-out, provided by email, showed pre-Whitman mass public shootings in 20 states--all but two resulting in less than 10 deaths. ""Even though they didn’t match the number of victims killed or wounded in the UT-Austin shooting,"" Duwe said, ""they certainly qualify as mass public shootings."" According to the compilation, two pre-Whitman shooters caused more than a dozen deaths: Unruh and Frank Gonzalez, a California man who shot pilots on a passenger plane in May 1964; 43 people perished. A caution Generally, Fox and Duwe each cautioned against getting bogged down in assessments of first or worst mass shootings partly because, due to the limits of the commonly accepted definition, incidents such as the Saint Valentine’s Day and Wounded Knee massacres get parsed out. ""This whole thing of what’s the largest,"" Fox said, ""is really an absurd exercise as if any of these episodes would be any less tragic if wasn’t the largest."" Whitman, he added, ""certainly did for many many years embody what Americans thought of when they heard mass murder."" Our ruling Adler said Austin was the ""site of the first mass shooting in the country."" The UT tragedy appears to have been the nation’s first mass public shooting on a college campus. But there were 30 mass shootings--mass murders of four or more individuals in a 24-hour period--just in the 60-plus years before Whitman acted. We rate the statement False.

Loretta Lynch says gays and lesbians are most frequently targeted for hate crimes
","The Orlando shooting massacre at the Pulse gay nightclub that led to the deaths of 49 victims has led to more national attention about hate crimes targeting the gay community. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch spoke about the attack hours later on Fox News Sunday. ""I think we have to keep our eye on a larger picture here, which is the victims of this crime were from a community that is often marginalized and that, frankly, the LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group,"" she said. Lynch is correct if we examine per capita rates for hate crimes, although there are some caveats about the data -- mainly that there are gaps in how law enforcement reports hate crimes. The FBI defines hate crimes as ""criminal offenses motivated, in whole or in part, by the offender’s bias against"" a particular group such as a religion, race or sexual orientation. Data on hate crimes A spokesman for Lynch said she was referring to an analysis by the New York Times published days after the Orlando shooting. Using data from the FBI and the U.S. Census, the newspaper compared hate crimes per capita in two years: 2005 and 2014. The newspaper found ""L.G.B.T. people are twice as likely to be targeted as African-Americans, and the rate of hate crimes against them has surpassed that of crimes against Jews."" Mark Potok, an expert on extremism at the Southern Poverty Law Center, did a similar analysis of 14 years of hate crime data in 2011. He found that LGBT (lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender) people are far more likely than other minority groups to be victimized by violent hate crimes. Potok examined the percentage of the population represented by these groups:  LGBT, Jews, blacks, Muslims, Latinos and whites. Then he compiled the total number of hate crimes against persons (excluding crimes against property) between 1995 and 2008. Then he compared the level of hate crime aimed at each group to the group’s percentage in the population to determine the rate of victimization. He found that LGBT people were victimized at 8.3 times the expected rate. Jews were victimized at 3.5 times the expected rate, blacks at 3.2 times, Muslims at 1.9 times, Latinos at 0.6 times, and whites at 0.2 times. An important caveat: There are several holes in the reporting of hate crimes to the FBI. Local law enforcement agencies voluntarily report their data to a state agency that compiles the information for the FBI. Some local agencies report no hate crimes or don’t submit a report. A study by the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 60 percent of violent hate crime victimizations were not reported to police in 2012. A 2016 Associated Press investigation found that more than 2,700 city police and county sheriff's departments have not submitted a single hate crime report to the FBI during the past six years — about 17 percent of all city and county law enforcement agencies nationwide. Among the agencies that reported zero hate crimes in 2014 were several major cities, including Jacksonville, Miami and Tampa. Another way to look at the data about hate crimes rather than per capita is the sheer number of crimes. By that measure, there were more hate crimes against African-Americans than LGBT residents. But that’s not surprising since African-Americans represent about 13.2 percent of the population according to the U.S. Census, while the LGBT community represents about 2.3 percent of the population, according to a survey done by the Centers for Disease Control (other surveys found a slightly higher rate.) Why would LGBT be victimized at a higher rate Answering the question as to why the LGBT community would be victimized at a higher rate is more complex. Some of the crime, paradoxically, may be motivated by more widespread acceptance of gay rights. ""We are seeing lots more gay people getting married,"" said Jack Levin, a sociologist at Northeastern University and expert on hate crimes. ""I think what hate crimes represent is a reaction to that."" Some are motivated by fear. ""There is a visceral hatred against LGBT people in large part connected to fears about sexuality,"" Potok said. ""Sexuality is an incredibly fraught topic for some people and especially those people who fear they might have same-sex attraction themselves."" Law enforcement is still investigating the Orlando shooting, but based on information so far, experts said that the shooter appeared to be motivated in part by bigotry and self-loathing. Omar Mateen, who was married to a woman, regularly visited the gay nightclub and used gay dating apps, according to reports by patrons at the club. Our ruling Lynch said, ""The LGBT community is more often the victims of hate crimes than any other recognized group."" It’s worth noting that there may be widespread underreporting of hate crime incidents in general. However, the best available research shows that the LGBT community is victimized at a higher rate than other minority groups, according to FBI data.  We rate this claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c6bf52bd-bfaf-4b75-95ce-8cd3348a1de6",/factchecks/2016/jun/23/loretta-lynch/loretta-lynch-says-gays-and-lesbians-are-most-freq/

Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton 'slept' through Benghazi attack
","Donald Trump says Hillary Clinton slept through the Benghazi attack, missing the proverbial 3 a.m. phone call. In a June 22 speech, Trump said Clinton’s decisions as secretary of state ""spread death, destruction and terrorism everywhere she touched. Among the victims was our late Ambassador Chris Stevens. I mean what she did with him was absolutely horrible. He was left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed. That’s right. When the phone rang, as per the commercial, at 3:00 in the morning, Hillary Clinton was sleeping."" Trump has made this claim before. Was Clinton really asleep in her bed Sept. 11, 2012, while terrorists killed four Americans in the Libyan city of Benghazi?  No. The, attack took place at about 9:30 p.m. Benghazi time, or 3:30 in the afternoon Washington time on a Tuesday. Clinton was at her State Department office.   None of the numerous congressional investigations into the attacks have faulted Clinton for her actions as the attacks unfolded that day or said she could have done something different on Sept. 12 that would have saved lives. For her part, Clinton has said in her memoir Hard Choices and in congressional testimony that she worked late into the night and did not sleep, though she did work from her Washington home for at least part of the night. We cannot independently confirm what she did that night, but we do know she released a public statement after 10 p.m. and emailed her daughter, Chelsea, after 11 p.m. The military, not the State Department, was in charge of responding to the attacks as they unfolded. At that time, the military had a limited presence in North Africa, but congressional investigations concluded that it did the best it could on the night of the attack with the resources available. ""Given the military’s preparations on Sept. 11, 2012, majority members have not yet discerned any response alternatives that could have likely changed the outcome of the Benghazi attack,"" found the House Armed Services Committee in a 2014 report. That report and another by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence found that no outside parties — such as the State Department or the White House — hindered the military nor the intelligence community in their immediate defensive response to the attacks as they unfolded. For a while after the attack, some Republican members of Congress claimed an official — some speculated Clinton  — told military or intelligence personnel to ""stand down"" while the attack occurred. The movie 13 Hours dramatizing the attacks perpetuates this rumor. But there is no evidence that anyone, much less Clinton, told personnel to ""stand down,"" and at least two of the investigative reports conclude definitively that no one gave such an order. It is generally understood that the State Department failed to adequately secure the Benghazi diplomatic compound, despite awareness of a deteriorating security situation in the region. These failings made the compound vulnerable to attack and unable to effectively defend itself. What role Clinton played in addressing these security issues prior to the attack taking place is in dispute. Some Republicans have claimed that Clinton personally denied or ignored requests for security from diplomats in Benghazi, including Ambassador Chris Stevens. We and other fact-checkers have highlighted the fact there is no unequivocal proof that Clinton personally, deliberately, ignored security requests. An internal State Department review concluded that the security failings resulted from bureaucratic confusion and made specific recommendations to prevent a repeat of the Benghazi attack. Clinton has accepted ultimate responsibility for the attack, as the head of the State Department at the time, though she has said administrators below her were responsible for making specific security decisions. Our ruling Trump said the Benghazi victims were ""left helpless to die as Hillary Clinton soundly slept in her bed."" Clinton was not literally sleeping when the Benghazi attacks unfolded, as it was mid afternoon on a Tuesday in Washington. She worked late into the night, as is evidenced by an 11 p.m. email. If we take Trump’s claim more broadly, that Clinton was inattentive throughout the hours in which the attacks occurred, none of the many congressional investigations into Benghazi have made that assertion. We rate Trump’s claim False.",/factchecks/2016/jun/23/donald-trump/donald-trump-says-hillary-clinton-slept-through-be/

Liberal filmmaker Michael Moore incorrectly claims AR-15 bullets banned by Geneva Convention
","Filmmaker and liberal commentator Michael Moore made a provocative claim about the ammunition used in the June 12 Orlando shooting — that it is prohibited by the Geneva Conventions. ""Ammo used in AR-15/M-16 is banned by Geneva Convention,"" Moore tweeted June 14. ""It enters the body, spins & explodes. Show the crime scene photos and the NRA is over.""   The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives reported June 12 that Omar Mateen had been in possession of a 9 millimeter semiautomatic pistol and a .223 caliber AR-type rifle. The latter was later identified as a Sig Sauer MCX rifle by the gun shop owner who sold Mateen the gun. Law enforcement has not released the exact type of .223-caliber ammunition used as of this fact-check’s publication. Still, many people responded on Twitter to Moore trying to debunk his tweet, so we took a closer look. We contacted Moore's office but didn't hear back.  What is the Geneva Convention? The 1949 Geneva Conventions are a set of treaties and protocols dictating the humane treatment of people during war. For example, they prohibit torture, hostage-taking, deportation and execution without ""judicial guarantees."" In particular, the Conventions prescribe protections for various classes — the ill, medical workers, prisoners of war and civilians during wartime. The main text of the Geneva Convention treaties does not include any specific mention of prohibited ammunition, and neither do the supplementary protocols. The closest thing to Moore’s claim is Article 35 of the first protocol. It prohibits ""weapons, projectiles and materials … causing superfluous injury or unnecessary suffering"" but does not offer further clarification. In any case, the Geneva Convention does not apply to domestic weapon use, said Dan Joyner, a professor of law at the University of Alabama. Only wartime. ""No source of international law prohibits the sale or use within a country of any particular kind of ammunition,"" Joyner said. Mateen’s declaration of allegiance to ISIS does give the incident an international character, but the Conventions primarily apply to issues between nation-factions. Different conventions We looked at other international conventions to see if they banned certain ammunition. Some do, but experts suggested Mateen’s ammunition might not qualify, again because these agreements are binding for traditional warfare, not domestic purchases. The first appearance of an ammunition ban in international treaties comes in the 1868 Declaration of St. Petersburg, which bans explosive or flammable projectiles weighing less than 400 grams. Declaration III of the 1899 Hague Convention bans bullets that ""expand or flatten"" upon entering the body — commonly known as ""hollow-point bullets."" The same language is included in the 1998 Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court. The catch? Hague only applies ""in the case of war"" between two or more signatories. Rome only creates jurisdiction over genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. Case in point, the International Committee of the Red Cross notes that many parties to the Hague Convention use ""expanding bullets"" in their domestic police forces. Gary Mauser, professor emeritus at Simon Fraser University, said Moore’s claim errs in relating the Orlando shooting to the Convention. ""That ban does not apply to the attacker in Orlando since he was not part of a formal military force,"" Mauser said. In its newly set International Small Arms Control Standards, the United Nations has recently included a ban on a narrowly defined type of armor-piercing ammunition. However, these protocols are only guidance for how countries could choose to behave domestically, Mauser said. ""ISACS recommendations are merely recommendations, and do not have the force of law, either internationally or within any nation,"" said Mauser, who is also an ISACS expert advisor. The bullets Experts are unsure whether Mateen’s ammunition matches what the treaties describe anyway, as law enforcement officials have not yet released the exact type of bullet Mateen used. George Mocsary, a professor of law at Southern Illinois University, said that the vast majority of AR-15 bullets (mentioned in Moore’s tweet) are .223 ""full metal jackets."" These, Mocsary said, would not violate any conventions because they are ""not expanding,"" ""not explosive,"" and ""not armour-piercing by the ISACS definition."" Mocsary did, however, note that many .223 rounds can penetrate some armour simply by nature of being shot from a rifle. However, investigators have not confirmed whether ""full metal jackets"" were in fact what Mateen used. Tim O’Rourke, an investigator for The Grafton Group forensic science firm, said it is impossible to definitively characterize Mateen’s rounds without further information. It is possible and legal to purchase hollow-point ""controlled expansion"" rounds in Florida, he said. Regarding what Moore tweeted about the bullets’ ""spin,"" O’Rourke noted it is possible for bullets to ""tumble"" in the body depending on contingent factors such as barrel length and distance fired. O’Rourke noted, however, that the bullets would not be designed to explode or detonate in the body. Nonetheless, doctors treating the injuries noted the severe damage done to victim’s bodies, such as ""big, giant cavities"" in the victims. One mentioned that bullets struck with such force that ripple effects damaged even nearby tissue. ""It actually puts kinetic energy into tissue that it didn't hit,"" said doctor John M. Porter in the Philadelphia Inquirer. ""It can go next to the liver and still destroy the liver."" Our ruling Moore tweeted that the Geneva Convention prohibits the type of ammunition used in the Orlando shooting. However, the Geneva Convention does not deal with ammunition. Other international conventions do prohibit certain ammunition, but only during wartime, not domestically. Even if they were binding domestically, experts are not sure whether Mateen’s bullets qualify, given the limited information released from law enforcement. That being said, Moore’s tweet does emphasize the amount of damage these bullets inflicted. Even if his specifics might be off, doctors’ reports support Moore on the general point about damages. We rate Moore’s claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/c7d1cc63-b740-4c9e-ae93-d00188ad5e6a",/factchecks/2016/jun/23/michael-moore/liberal-filmmaker-michael-moore-says-ar-15-bullets/

Sen. Cory Booker says al-Qaida has urged followers to use lax U.S. gun laws to kill Americans
","New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker was one of the U.S. senators who spent nearly 15 hours in an overnight filibuster designed to pressure Congress to vote on two gun amendments proposed in response to the mass shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Fla. One would block anyone on the government's terrorist watch list from buying a firearm. The other would expand background checks to all gun show purchases and internet sales. Both were rejected in a largely party-line vote June 20, 2016. Ahead of the vote, MSNBC's Chris Matthews asked Booker in a June 16 interview how the filibuster would ""lead to an actual bill, something the president can sign?"" ""Well, what I have been finding recently is how many Americans did not realize that you can be under investigation by the FBI, that you could have been put on the no-fly list because you were considered to be too dangerous to enter plane, but you could still go out and buy a trunk load full of weapons,"" he said. ""And so here we have this real war that we’re on — a war against terrorism. We’re basically telling our enemy, exploit this loophole. In fact, our enemy, al-Qaida operatives, have said, 'Hey, we want you to use this loophole to attack and kill Americans.' "" We've covered the fact that people on terrorist watch lists have been able to buy firearms. For this fact-check, we decided to look into whether al-Qaida propaganda has actually been urging people to exploit that situation. When we contacted Booker's office, a spokesman responded immediately with several links, all pointing to a 2011 video made by Adam Gadahn, an American serving as a spokesman for al-Qaida. ""Muslims in the west have to remember they are perfectly placed to play an important and decisive part in the jihad against the Zionists and crusaders, and to do major damage to the enemies of Islam, waging war on their religion, sacred places, and things and brethren. This is a golden opportunity"" to rush to do battle with everything at your disposal, he says. ""And in the West, you've got a lot at your disposal. Let’s take America as an example,"" Gadahn said. ""America is absolutely awash with easily obtainable firearms. You can go down to a gun show at the local convention center and come away with a fully automatic assault rifle, without a background check, and most likely without having to show an identification card. So what are you waiting for?"" (Gadahn's information was not entirely correct. As CNN noted, only specially licensed dealers can sell fully automatic weapons and they require a background check.) Gadahn, the first American charged with treason since World War II and an occupant of the FBI's list of most-wanted terrorists, was killed by the United States in January 2015 counterterrorism operation. Max Abrahms, an assistant professor of political science at Northeastern University, said he couldn't recall ""any other videos as explicit about the ease of using guns in the United States on Islamists' behalf. That said, I would be surprised if there isn't other propaganda seeking to exploit the permissiveness of gun access in the U.S."" Our ruling Booker said, ""Al-Qaida operatives, have said, 'Hey, we want you to use this loophole (for purchasing guns despite being on a watch list) to attack and kill Americans."" We've seen a 2011 video from one operative, an Al-Qaida spokesman born and raised in America, who did indeed urge Muslims to use the gun show loophole to purchase weapons and attack Americans. While an expert said its reasonable that other pieces of propaganda exist, we don't know of any. With that caveat, we rate the claim as Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/475e31b4-c182-4fd0-9834-ea5d0efad56f",/factchecks/2016/jun/23/cory-booker/sen-cory-booker-says-al-qaida-has-urged-followers-/
