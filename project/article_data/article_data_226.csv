Sean Hannity vows not to appear onstage at Trump rally, then he does
","On the eve of the midterm elections, Fox News host Sean Hannity promised he would not go onstage to campaign with President Donald Trump at a rally. Later that evening, he appeared to do exactly that.   Both Hannity and Trump were in Cape Girardeau, Mo., where incumbent Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill is locked in a close race with Republican state Attorney General Josh Hawley. Trump was there to amp up the crowd for Hawley ahead of the vote. Earlier that day, Hannity said he would broadcast his nightly show from the rally venue, but pledged not to participate in the campaign event. ""In spite of reports, I will be doing a live show from Cape Girardeau and interviewing President Trump before the rally,"" the Fox News host tweeted. ""To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the president. I am covering final rally for my show. Something I have done in every election in the past.""  In spite of reports, I will be doing a live show from Cape Girardeau and interviewing President Trump before the rally. To be clear, I will not be on stage campaigning with the President. I am covering final rally for my show. Something I have done in every election in the past. Yet minutes into Trump’s remarks, the president praised Hannity and called him onstage. ""I have a few people, and they’re right out here, and they’re very special, they’ve done an incredible job for us,"" Trump told the crowd. ""They’ve been with us from the beginning also. I’m going to start by saying, Sean Hannity, come on up."" Hannity took the stage and embraced Trump. Then the Fox News host approached the podium and wagged his finger at the media, which included reporters with Fox News. ""By the way, all those people in the back are fake news,"" he said to applause, invoking one of Trump’s favorite epithets. Hannity told the crowd he was unaware Trump would call him onstage. He then delivered an inventory of Trump’s accomplishments, took a veiled swipe at former President Barack Obama, then left the stage. ""The one thing that has made and defined your presidency more than anything else,"" Hannity said, ""promises made, promises kept."" To any reasonable observer, it looked like Hannity was onstage campaigning with the president — in direct contradiction to his statement hours earlier. Fox News did not respond to a request for comment. Hannity and Trump have had each other's ears since the 2016 election, when Hannity openly supported Trump’s presidential bid, provided political counseling to the candidate, and even appeared in a pro-Trump ad ahead of the vote. ""I’m not hiding the fact that I want Donald Trump to be the next president of the United States."" Hannity told the New York Times in August 2016, adding, ""I never claimed to be a journalist."" (In a subsequent interview with Times, Hannity described himself as an ""advocacy journalist."") Fox News draws a distinction between its opinion and news sides of the house. But the relationship between Fox News opinion programming and the Trump White House has raised ethical questions about whether the channel is reporting the news or promoting the president’s agenda. Hannity, whose evening show attracts more than 3 million viewers, is the network’s most popular opinionator, and his program is typically the most-watched cable news talk show. The day after the rally, Fox News issued the following statement: ""Fox News does not condone any talent participating in campaign events. We have an extraordinary team of journalists helming our coverage tonight and we are extremely proud of their work. This was an unfortunate distraction and has been addressed."" The network also pointed to a tweet from Sean Hannity about the incident, that said he was surprised to be called onstage and that  his earlier tweet was truthful.  What I said in my tweet yesterday was 100% truthful. When the POTUS invited me on stage to give a few remarks last night, I was surprised, yet honored by the president’s request. This was NOT planned. In any case, Hannity did in fact appear onstage to campaign with Trump at a rally, directly contradicting himself. Hannity promised he would not go onstage to campaign with Trump at a rally. Hours later, he did exactly that. We rate this a Full Flop. Update: This story was updated soon after its initial publication to include a statement from Fox News and a tweet from Sean Hannity.

DeSantis puts words in Gillum's mouth that he didn't say in Florida governor race
","Republican Ron DeSantis and GOP groups have painted Democrat Andrew Gillum as anti-police. In an interview with Sean Hannity on Oct. 30, 2018, DeSantis doubled down on his claim that Gillum is anti-law enforcement. ""There is no doubt that there's corruption in Tallahassee,"" DeSantis said. ""It is one of the most corrupt cities in Florida. It also has the highest crime rate in Florida. And this is a guy who has taken a pledge attacking our men and women in law enforcement. He will not standby them."" A few moments later, Hannity said he had read that Gillum was ""not a big fan of police."" DeSantis responded, ""He said police and prisons have no place in justice. It’s outrageous."" Gillum is the Democratic candidate for Florida governor and the mayor of Tallahassee. He’s up against DeSantis, a former congressman backed by President Donald Trump. We’ve looked at DeSantis’ and Gillum’s claims about Tallahassee’s crime rate as well as attacks on Gillum about an FBI probe. Gillum never said that ""police and prisons have no place in justice."" When we asked the DeSantis campaign what their evidence was, they pointed to Gillum’s relationship with the group Dream Defenders. We'll explain the connection, but Gillum never said those words.  DeSantis often zeroes in on the social justice group Dream Defenders, a group that has raised concerns about racial profiling since the 2012 death of Trayvon Martin, the young unarmed African-American teenager shot by a neighborhood watch volunteer in Sanford, Fla. Gillum’s support for the Dream Defenders goes back to the group’s formation, although both the Dream Defenders and Gillum have said they do not share the entirety of each other’s platforms. A Gillum spokesman told the Miami Herald in late September that the Dream Defenders were leaders for the struggle for social justice in Florida, but that Gillum did not agree with several of the group’s positions.

Dream Defenders spokeswoman Nailah Summers agreed, telling the Herald that the Dream Defenders were ""more left-leaning"" than Gillum and that they disagreed on topics including the role of police and prisons, the functionality of borders and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.

When DeSantis said Gillum signed a pledge attacking law enforcement, he was referring to the Freedom Papers elected officials pledge. This pledge is a two-page document that calls on those who sign it to pledge not to take a penny from the NRA or the Geo Group, a private prison operator. ""I will fight for a Florida that divests from prisons, detention centers, guns and police and invests in the basic needs and safety of its people, especially its children,"" the pledge stated. ""I will fight for a reallocation of our state budget from police and prisons to good food, affordable housing, quality health care and public education."" Gillum signed the pledge in June 2018, along with the three other Democratic gubernatorial candidates at the time, according to Dream Defenders spokeswoman Nailah Summers. The candidates signed the pledge following a debate co-hosted by the Dream Defenders. Summers said 30 Florida politicians have signed the pledge. The Freedom Papers elected officials pledge is a different document than the Freedom Papers, a longer document that outlines the Dream Defenders’ views in more detail. However, the two-page elected officials pledge contains the line, ""I pledge my support to the Freedom Papers."" The Freedom Papers is a 20-page document that makes a series of statements about social and economic issues, particularly those that affect poor people, minorities and immigrants. The papers raise concerns about underpaid teachers, income inequality, rent hikes and calls for open elections and an end to violence.

The Freedom Papers document includes a few paragraphs that are highly critical of police and prisons, stretching back to the days when police helped catch escaped slaves.

""Police and prisons have no place in 'justice,' "" this longer document stated. ""Police and prisons aren’t just racist but they work to enforce the separations of rich and poor. True safety can’t be found where it was never meant to.""

The papers also state that prisons separate rich from poor. ""We deserve real safety over our cities, our states, our homes, our schools, our workplaces, and our community centers,"" the pledge stated. Gillum has called for criminal justice reform, but his record shows that he wants to work with law enforcement. In a 2014 Tallahassee Democrat op-ed, Gillum talked about a ride-along he went on with Tallahassee police and implored community members to support them. ""For the sake of my children and yours, I hope you will join me in supporting our law-enforcement officers and investing your time and talents for the betterment of our community,"" Gillum wrote at the time. During Gillum’s tenure as mayor, Tallahassee added more than 50 police officer positions. Tallahassee started several law enforcement-related programs focused on fostering relationships between community members and police and on improving recidivism rates while Gillum was mayor and earlier while he was a city commissioner. Gillum did sign the Dream Defenders elected officials pledge, but we could find no evidence of him saying ""police and prisons have no place in justice."" That’s a line from the Dream Defenders’ longer document, the Freedom Papers. The pledge Gillum signed focuses on divesting from prisons, guns and police and putting money into safety and education. Signees also agree not to take money from the NRA or a private prison group. The longer document, the Freedom Papers, expands on the Dream Defenders’ views with 20-pages of statements about a range of social and economic issues. The two-page elected officials pledge contains the line, ""I pledge my support to the Freedom Papers."" However, Gillum and the Dream Defenders maintain that they do not see eye-to-eye on several issues and that the Dream Defenders are ""more left-leaning"" than Gillum.

In Illinois, Mike Bost attacks Brendan Kelly's record as prosecutor
","How do you define ""soft on crime?"" Mike Bost, a Republican congressman from southern Illinois, says his Democratic challenger, Brendan Kelly, embodies the definition. In a Bost-sponsored ad still running in the congressional campaign’s final days, an announcer says Kelly, a state’s attorney (the county prosecutor) for St. Clair County, ""allowed half of the criminals he faced to walk free."" ""That's 50 percent walk free!"" the ad in Illinois’ 12th Congressional District says. ""Kelly failed to protect women who were violently assaulted, allowed those guilty of sexual assault to cut inexcusable plea deals. That's a failed record."" Fifty percent sounds like a lot of criminals out on the street. So we looked to see if the numbers are accurate, and how they fit in the general scheme of crime and prosecution. We can tell you already that the numbers are correct if ""free"" means probation -- not only for cases prosecuted by Kelly but for those throughout Illinois. Bost's scary ad fails to note the reality of prosecution. Kelly became his county’s prosecutor in 2010. The Bost ad says Kelly ""allowed half of the criminals he faced to walk free."" We asked Bost’s campaign where it got that 50 percent figure, and were told it came from public records in the court system. What was the exact figure? Did Bost’s campaign look at every case Kelly and his office prosecuted, or did it use a sample? Bost’s campaign would not say, repeating in a series of emails with us that the source of the claim was public records. So we looked at a variety of data nationally, getting figures from the The Sentencing Project and the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics. It seemed like the 50 percent figure was somewhere in the ballpark of cases everywhere.  Then we got specific data for every felony conviction in Illinois, thanks to annual reports from the state courts. The year 2016 is the most recent, so we'll use those figures here: Of the 1,895 felony defendants prosecuted by Kelly's office that year, 1200 were convicted. That's a 63 percent conviction rate. So what happened to those 1,200 convicts? State records show 392 of them, or 33 percent, were sentenced to prison. Far more, 788, got probation. That means 66 percent of the criminals Kelly prosecuted ""walked,"" to use Bost's term, with probation. But how does that compare with the statewide figures? The statewide conviction rate -- for every felony defendant in Illinois in 2016 -- was 65 percent, making Kelly's conviction rate a near match. Of those convicted, 42 percent went to prison. That's higher than in Kelly's county, but Cook Couty, whose seat is Chicago, skews the totals. Looking only at other counties, Bost is 1 point higher than the average.  The trend was similar in 2015: 32 percent of convicted felons were sent to prison in Kelly's county, and 43 percent were statewide. Take out Cook County and the statewide average is 33.5 percent. So prosecutors across the state let criminals, in Bost's phraseology, ""walk free.""  The ad claims that Kelly allowed ""those guilty of sexual assault to cut inexcusable plea deals."" The commercial also cites St. Clair County Circuit Court records, without specifics, as the source for this. We asked for more information, and Bost’s campaign sent us synopses of four cases -- each involving a separate woman who was violently assaulted. In each case, the punishment for the men involved could have been more than a decade in prison. But in each of these cases, a plea deal from Kelly’s office resulted in probation -- 24 months in three of the cases, 30 months in the fourth. ""These plea deals allow predators to go right back on the street and put women and children in our communities at risk,"" Bost’s campaign said in an email. Kelly’s decisions on how to handle cases has been a theme for attacks from Bost or Bost’s allies throughout the campaign. Some of the discussion stems from stories in the Belleville News-Democrat, including its 2015 series, ""Violation of Trust."" An online headline said it best: ""Sex crime victims in Southern Illinois find that police, prosecutors typically do not charge their attackers. From 2005 to 2013, 70 percent of sex crimes never made it to a courtroom."" The newspaper’s investigation covered cases from 2005 through 2013. It found that in St. Clair County, the state’s attorney prosecuted just 18 percent of felony sex crimes reported to police. Part of the problem was that prosecutors didn’t deem all reports of sexual abuse eligible or strong enough for prosecution. The trend in southern Illinois was not unique. The Minneapolis Star Tribune found that in the two-year period of 2015 and 2016, fewer than one in 10 reported sexual assaults produced a conviction. Other studies have shown this, too. Kelly took office in 2010, so his office prosecuted cases covered in only three of the nine years the newspaper investigation covered. But prosecution rates improved under Kelly. In 2012 and 2013, about 30 percent of sex crime reports resulted in charges being filed, the News-Democrat said, and conviction rates for adult defendants in those cases was relatively high. Asked why prosecutors didn’t take on more cases, Kelly told the News-Democrat, ""We want to justly convict the guilty, but more importantly seek as much justice as possible for the public and for victims. That’s what drives us. ... There is no cookie-cutter answer."" He also said some accused sex crime suspects may wind up being prosecuted for non-sex crimes such as aggravated battery and unlawful restraint that might not show up in the newspaper’s investigation. He cited an example of a defendant tried and convicted of non-sex felonies in a case that also involved rape. Kelly and his campaign have said they cannot disclose all the details that go into a case but the factors can include the best resolution for the victim. Asked about the cases presented to us by Bost’s campaign, Kelly spokeswoman Elana Schrager said, ""In each of these four cases, Brendan worked closely with each of the survivors to ensure justice was achieved while respecting her wishes."" Bost says that Kelly ""allowed half of the criminals he faced to walk free"" and ""failed to protect women who were violently assaulted,"" allowing ""those guilty of sexual assault to cut inexcusable plea deals."" Bost’s campaign did not provide precise information when we asked repeatedly, but we found it anyway. If probation is viewed as letting a criminal walk free, Kelly is guilty -- as are prosecutors throughout Illinois. Very few counties had the opposite trend. Similarly, we also found, based on data from the Belleville News-Democrat as well as federal court data, that Bost’s general use of plea bargains is within the norms of state and national plea bargain rates. As for the ad’s claim that Kelly ""failed to protect women,"" Bost’s campaign said it based this on court cases. The information it sent us showed four men getting probation rather than prison. The information does not provide any nuances in the prosecution of each case. With all this in mind, we find Bost’s numbers are fine but shade the truth substantially about prosecution across his state. There are undoubtedly critics of the way Kelly has handled cases, just as there are people who praise him. This is a lot context to consider. Based on what we could measure and on the principles of the Truth-O-Meter --- specifically, the rating for a claim that contains an element of truth but is misleading -- we rate this Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096AC3780>],/factchecks/2018/nov/05/mike-bost/illinois-mike-bost-attacks-brendan-kellys-record-p/

Viral image supposedly depicting caravan members as rock-throwers dates back years
","Though the so-called ""migrant caravan"" isn’t expected to reach the U.S.-Mexico border until late November, efforts are well underway to sow fears that the people seeking refuge in the United States are violent, disrespectful and entitled.   A recent submission to this anthology suggests that the migrants fleeing Central America are coming to get you. ""All we want is a better life in your country,"" starts one Facebook post that appeared on Nov. 2. ""So we’re going to throw rocks and try to kill you."" The text frames an image of about a couple dozen men in what looks like a dusty melee. Some of the men have their arms in the air, and several seem to be throwing something. ""Dixon Diaz 2018"" appears to be written in the bottom left corner. ""To a liberal, its (sic) ok for poor people seeking refuge from violence to throw rocks at you,"" the The Snarky Conservative 2, which posted the image, commented. Some members of the migrant caravan have thrown rocks at the Guatemala-Mexico border, according to news reports. They also threw sticks during a standoff with Mexican police on Oct. 28, according to the Associated Press, a clash that left one migrant dead from a head wound, though the cause was unclear. On Nov. 1, President Donald Trump said he had told the military that troops should react to any rocks migrants throw at them as if they were rifles. But, the AP reports, ""while some migrants have clashed with Mexican police at a bridge on the Guatemala border, most of those traveling with the caravans have been peaceful and say they are fleeing violence and poverty at home."" ""We are not killers,"" the wire service quotes Stephany Lopez, a 21-year-old Salvadoran woman, as saying. The photo used in this Facebook post also does not show migrants throwing rocks. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Snopes noted in a 2016 fact-check that the ""Snarky Conservative"" is the creation of blogger Dixon Diaz—the name seemingly signed on the photo with a 2018 date. But a reverse Google image search turns up results related to the First Intifada in 1987, when Palestinians in the Israeli-occupied Gaza Strip rioted following the death of four Palestinian workers. Because the Palestinians were largely unarmed, the BBC reported 20 years after the revolt, ""the enduring picture of the intifada is one of young men and boys throwing stones and rocks at Israeli troops."" In a 2017 NISA journal article, Jeremy Pressman writes that throwing rocks was central to the intifada’s identity and definition. ""Stone-throwing was the most visible tactic Palestinians used in the first intifada."" The image appears on several blogs, though information about the photo, including the name of photographer, is missing. A website called torahcode.us includes the photo in an undated post about the intifada with the caption: ""Palestinian youths throwing rocks during the Intifada."" An undated timeline of the Arab-Israeli conflict posted on Timetoast.com, which lets users create timelines online, uses the image to illustrate ""The First Intifada"" in 1987. Other websites where the photo is posted also show that it predates the migrant caravan. It was included in a slideshow of pictures attributed to the intifada on this WordPress blog—""Palestina en el corazon,"" by Maria Landi—in December 2017. A reverse image search on TinEye.com shows that the first time the image search and recognition site found the image online was in 2008, when it was used as part an entry on Inciclopedia.wikia.com, a free Spanish-language online encyclopedia like Wikipedia. The caption for that image, when translated from Spanish, is: ""Squadron 202 of the special forces of the Mexican army making use of its sophisticaed weapons."" But when you click on the image’s file history, it says the image is named ""Palestinianyouth2www.jpg"" and was created in March 2007. Though the photo is widely used in connection with the intifada, we couldn’t find any news reports or retrospectives that featured the image with an official caption or credited to a photographer or publication. However, it’s clear that it’s been around since at least the mid-2000s, and its grainy quality suggests it’s even older. And what’s more, no credible outlets link it to the Central American migrants seeking refuge in the United States. We rate this claim Pants on Fire! Correction and update (Nov. 8, 2018): The Facebook user who posted this meme goes by the name The Snarky Conservative 2. In an earlier version of this post, we linked to a different account.

Checking Claire McCaskill on GOP's plan for pre-existing conditions
","Sen. Claire McCaskill has been a supporter of the Affordable Care Act, especially when it comes to protecting pre-existing conditions. Her opponent, Attorney General Josh Hawley, is part of a lawsuit that is trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act, which would take away mandatory coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. Hawley says he’s for protecting this coverage, just not through the current law. During their second debate, Hawley mentioned a bill on reinsurance as a way to cover people with pre-existing conditions. The measure is sponsored by Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Fla., and Susan Collins, R-Maine. McCaskill’s rebuttal was quite clear: ""The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions,"" she said. So who is right? We reached out to the McCaskill campaign for evidence, which pointed to a CNBC article. We decided to check out the bill for ourselves.   When Collins introduced the bill, she said it was ""a bill that would allow states to protect people with pre-existing conditions while lowering premiums through the use of these high-risk pools."" But the bill doesn’t actually contain the words ""pre-existing conditions"" — more on that in a second. The bill’s actual name is the Lower Premiums Through Reinsurance Act of 2017. It’s intended to ""reinsure"" insurance companies for taking on high-risk individuals. The bill would allow states to design their own reinsurance programs, which would then allow them to be eligible for federal funding. The bill would allocate $4.5 billion over two years, and states could use the federal funding to provide the reinsurance in a way that is up to them. At issue is the role of high-risk pools. That’s where people who have high premiums would be grouped, regardless of whether they have pre-existing conditions. The phrase ""pre-existing conditions"" doesn’t show up anywhere in the bill. Instead the bill uses ""high-risk"" as a qualifier for funding. Experts in health care whom we reached disagreed with McCaskill that pre-existing conditions would have nothing to do with the bill. Anup Malani, professor of law and medicine at the University of Chicago, said that many pre-existing conditions would qualify as a high-risk of using medical care. Alan B. Cohen, research professor at Boston University, believes there is no straight-forward answer, as reinsurance programs just shift the risk from one entity to another. Cohen brought up an interesting point that the bill does not mention in the definition of ""high-risk"" individuals. ""It is plausible that a state could define high-risk individuals as those with pre-existing medical conditions, but there is no guarantee that will be the case."" States would be in charge of making their own definitions of high-risk pools, and deciding whether to guarantee coverage for people with pre-existing conditions through this bill. So although the Collins referenced pre-existing conditions when speaking on the bill, there is no guarantee that states will be able to protect everyone with a pre-existing condition. Also, this approach relies on adequate funding. States have tried high-risk pools before and they often fell short because they didn’t have enough money. The bill is an incentive for states to reinsure insurance companies to cover individuals who are high-risk. If the government covers the costs of high risk people, then insurance companies could keep low-risk individuals’ rates low, so the logic goes. McCaskill said, ""The Collins-Nelson bill will not protect pre-existing conditions. It has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions."" The bill would help insurance companies cover individuals who are high-risk, which is a category that many pre-existing conditions fall into. While the bill allows the states to make their own decisions -- meaning there’s no guarantee that pre-existing conditions will be protected across the board -- it is an exaggeration to say it has nothing to do with pre-existing conditions. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097D41680>],/factchecks/2018/nov/05/claire-mccaskill/checking-claire-mccaskill-gops-plan-pre-existing-c/

","In the Oct. 25 debate between Missouri Attorney General Josh Hawley and Sen. Claire McCaskill, an audience member asked about businesses and jobs moving out of the country. Hawley, who is vying for McCaskill’s Senate seat, sought to explain how that issue was personal to him. ""The rural town that I grew up in — Lexington, Missouri, it's not too far from here — we used to have a manufacturing operation in that town, made the gunstock for Remington rifles, I believe it was,"" he said. ""And that plant closed down, we lost those jobs and it's been devastating for my little town."" We wanted to know more about Hawley’s story. Was it true that a gunstock manufacturing operation closed, taking away jobs? Gunstock manufacturer S&K Industries, a gunstock manufacturing company founded by Roy Stout in 1961. In 1986, S&K picked up Remington Arms as a client. The family business had three locations in Lexington, said Penny Grosso, executive director of the Lexington Chamber of Cmmerce. Remington went on to buy two of them, said city administrator Joe Aull. (We confirmed one facility’s purchase happened in September 2009, according to a 2010 air pollution permit with the Missouri Department of Natural Resources.) We wondered how the sale might have led to a facility closure or lost jobs. Finding the answer was more complicated than we thought. Multiple calls to Remington Arms Company’s national press office were not returned. Former S&K president Thomas Stout could not be reached. The Hawley campaign did not respond. After checking past records and speaking with a longtime plant worker, Aull said S&K never shut down its facilities before the sale. The third site, at 8th and Main streets, was not part of the Remington sale. We found another 2010 air pollution permit for S&K to operate a ""new wood trophy parts and plaque painting process"" on that location. That permit noted S&K previously housed a gunstock manufacturing facility there. But, ""the operation was shut down in December 2008"" and the original permit eventually expired. It should be noted that from 2008 to the sale, S&K was still selling gunstocks, per many posts on an online forum for gun owners, suggesting the other locations were still in operation. As a postscript: Lexington’s Remington Arms almost closed down, but in 2017 received a $1.6 million state grant for upgrades to its plant in return for promising that the company would employ at least 80 people and stay in town for another five years. Hawley said that the gunstock manufacturing plant in his hometown of Lexington ""closed down."" Of the three S&K Industries locations in Lexington, one site shut down for gunstock manufacturing, but the rest continued operations and were purchased by Remington Arms without much hassle. So technically, Hawley is right, but it was just one facility, not an entire business. His statement overstates the effect, making it seem like the manufacturing business left town or was shuttered. We rate this statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809788CDC0>],/factchecks/2018/nov/05/josh-hawley/checking-josh-hawley-whether-gunstock-company-his-/

Is Claire McCaskill one of America’s most independent senators?
","Trying to maintain her Senate seat in a historically red state, Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., has touted her voting record and bipartisan work as examples of her independence in one of her campaign ads. ""Nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked Claire one of the most independent senators — right in the middle,"" her campaign said in a TV ad. Her Republican challenger, Attorney General Josh Hawley, is critical of her for often voting along party lines. Does McCaskill follow party precedent, or does she often stray from the left side of the aisle when making her decisions? McCaskill’s ad cited Congressional Quarterly, her GovTrack Analysis records and National Journal ideology rankings to back up the claimed independent streak. Here’s what they said: • Congressional Quarterly: The publication’s analysis showed McCaskill was one of the least likely to vote in line with her own party, doing so 82 percent of the time in 2017. Only three senators, Angus King (81 percent), Joe Donnelly (74 percent) and Joe Manchin (64 percent), broke from their party during votes more often than McCaskill. • GovTrack: GovTrack is a small, four-member organization that regularly publishes the status of federal legislation and information about representatives and senators in Congress. On the site’s analytics page for McCaskill, the first metric displayed is her ideology chart. She is one of approximately 10 senators that rests ideologically close to the middle. GovTrack’s report card for her 2017 legislative year ranked her the sixth most conservative Senate Democrat. She joined bipartisan bills the seventh most often of all senators. • National Journal: Since 2007, her first year in office, McCaskill was ranked by National Journal as the 43rd, 52nd, 53rd, 48th, 51st, 57th and 50th most conservative member of the Senate, respectively, of the 100 members. National Journal stopped creating its ideology rankings in 2013, according to McCaskill’s team. We reached out to six political science experts to shed some light on what factors might qualify a senator as independent. All but one of our experts noted that the wording of the claim is odd. As Cato Institute research fellow and editor Jason Kuznicki noted, ""‘Moderate’ and ‘independent’ are not synonyms."" Only two senators are currently registered as independent — Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and Angus King (I-Me.). University of Missouri professor of American politics Marvin Overby said the claim was an exaggeration. ""We live in an epoch where politics is very partisan and independent politicians are extraordinarily rare,"" he said. ""But, comparatively speaking, it is fair to say that — in a hyper-partisan age — McCaskill shows more independence than most."" McCaskill said ""nonpartisan experts have consistently ranked (her) one of the most independent senators — right in the middle."" It’s difficult if not impossible to define independence. Multiple studies show McCaskill voted against her party more so than  mostother Democrats. However, experts cautioned that a moderate or centrist voting record does not necessarily equate to being independent. For those reasons we rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280979F0580>],/factchecks/2018/nov/05/claire-mccaskill/sen-claire-mccaskill-one-americas-most-independent/

The West Virginia Republican Party says so. On Nov. 3, the West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, ""What did Joe Manchin say about civility?

Here’s what Manchin said: ""You might have seen the debate the other night. (Applause) I want to tell you something. It took every bit of my discipline not to beat the living crap out of them. You don't come to someone's state. You don't come in here and not knowing who we are and just be spewing out horrible things.

He ran in the primary and got beat, only got 9 percent of the vote. Who trusts who?"" Morrissey picked up on the ""beat the living crap"" remark, tweeting that ""the national media should look at so-called Mr. Civility in action."" But the West Virginia Republican Party’s tweet twisted Manchin’s words by not reporting his entire remark. In Marmet, Manchin did express his frustration with Morrisey’s attacks in the recent debate -- enough frustration to feel an impulse to ""beat the living crap out of"" his opponent. But the tweet leaves out an element of what Manchin said -- that ""it took every bit of my discipline"" not to do it. In other words, by the time he was speaking in Marmet, he had already extinguished that impulse. That said, even what Manchin did say does seem to conflict with a prior pledge in favor of civility. In February 2018, Manchin took to the Senate floor to pledge ""an era of bipartisan cooperation and agreement in order to restore civility to the United States Senate and our political discourse."" Manchin urged his colleagues to join him in co-signing his pledge and ""taking the first step to show the American people that they are here to work towards a better United States."" The West Virginia Republican Party tweeted, ""What did Joe Manchin say about civility? Today, he said he wanted to ‘beat the living crap out of’ his Republican opponent during their debate, at a campaign rally in Marmet. #WVSen"" This uses a portion of Manchin’s remarks, leaving out the fact that Manchin had prefaced that comment by saying, ""It took every bit of my discipline not to"" beat up Morrisey.

Did Joe Manchin support Obama and Clinton efforts to kill coal jobs?
","Donald Trump Jr. tweeted his support for Republican U.S. Senate candidate Patrick Morrisey — and his opposition to Morrissey's Democratic incumbent, Sen. Joe Manchin — on Oct. 13, 2018. Trump Jr. tweeted, ""Liberal Joe Manchin can’t be trusted to fight for West Virginia. He sold out Mountaineers when he supported Hillary Clinton over my father & on just about every other issue imaginable."" The tweet attached a Morrissey campaign ad that included the charge that Manchin ""supported Obama and Clinton’s campaigns to kill coal jobs."" Liberal @JoeManchinWV can’t be trusted to fight for West Virginia.He sold Mountaineers out when he supported Hillary Clinton over my father & on just about every other issue imaginable. @MorriseyWV can be trusted. He will always fight for YOU. #WVSEN #wv #wvpol pic.twitter.com/rkpfZgyrAQ   Those are fighting words in coal-producing West Virginia. So we wondered whether it is accurate that Manchin supported Hillary Clinton’s and Barack Obama’s efforts to kill coal jobs. As we have previously noted, Manchin did back Clinton in the 2016 election — an endorsement that turned out to be strongly at odds with most voters in a state that voted strongly for her Republican opponent, Donald Trump. (Manchin later told Politico that his decision to stick by Clinton was ""a mistake. It was a mistake politically."") But the Morrissey ad didn’t just refer to Manchin’s endorsement of the candidates. It went a step further and said that Manchin specifically supported their coal policies. And that doesn’t appear to be correct. In his initial campaign for Senate in 2010, he famously ran an ad in which he shot a copy of the cap-and-trade bill proposed by Obama and other Democrats that would have curbed emissions, potentially hurting the coal industry. (The bill was never enacted.) In an 2013 Washington Post article, Manchin said that Obama’s climate initiative -- which would have put coal at a disadvantage to other forms of energy -- amounted to a declaration of war on the coal industry. ""The regulations the President wants to force on coal are not feasible. And if it’s not feasible, it’s not reasonable,"" Manchin said. Manchin went on to say in the article that it is not acceptable to get rid of coal. ""It’s clear now that the president has declared a war on coal. It’s simply unacceptable that one of the key elements of his climate change proposal places regulations on coal that are completely impossible to meet with existing technology."" He joined Sen. Shelley Moore Capito, R-W.Va., to introduce the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act, which the lawmakers touted as helping ""rein in President Obama’s Clean Power Plan."" In 2015, he emphasized his opposition to Obama’s Clean Power Plan in a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Gina McCarthy. He also urged constituents to direct their opposition to the plan at field hearings. Saying he believed that the plan would ""result in escalating utility bills for Mountain State residents and even more coal mining job losses,"" Manchin wrote that ""forcing new coal-fired plants to meet standards when experts know that the required technology is not sustainably operational on a commercial scale makes absolutely no sense. By requiring technology that has never been adequately demonstrated, the EPA is forcing an industry to shut down and consumers to pay higher utility bills."" He also voted to advance a resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act to reverse the ""Waters of the U.S."" (WOTUS) rule, arguing that it would ""impact the coal mining in West Virginia."" Manchin’s Senate website also examples of Manchin supporting the coal industry, such as introducing in 2018 the Fossil Energy Utilization, Enhancement, and Leadership Act, which was designed to ""protect coal jobs and develop new technologies to be used domestically and exported internationally,"" and supporting efforts to use the Defense Production Act to protect ""clean-burning, coal-fired power plants."" The Morrisey campaign did not respond to repeated requests to offer examples of Manchin opposing the coal industry. A tweet posted by Patrick Morrisey and shared by Donald Trump Jr. said that Manchin ""supported Obama and Clinton's campaigns to kill coal jobs."" Manchin actively opposed the two biggest efforts backed by Obama and Clinton over coal industry opposition: the cap-and-trade bill and the Clean Power Plan. He also pursued other legislative and regulatory efforts that aided the coal industry.

FALSE: Attack ad’s claim Tony Thurmond was ‘sued by the ACLU’
","Was candidate for California schools chief Tony Thurmond ""sued by the ACLU""? That's one of the attention-grabbing claims in a recent TV attack ad and campaign mailer by a group supporting Marshall Tuck, Thurmond’s opponent in the race. The two Democrats are running for State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Thurmond is a state assemblyman who represents Richmond, Berkeley and other East Bay communities and is supported by teacher unions. Tuck is a former education executive backed by charter school groups. The incumbent, Tom Torlakson, will be termed out in January after serving two four-year terms. Several recent attack ads by each side, funded by tens of millions of campaign contributions, have turned the typically under-the-radar race into a hotly-contested one. We wanted to know whether there was evidence to support the claim Thurmond was ""sued by the ACLU."" Our research Before he was elected to the state Legislature, Thurmond was a board member for the West Contra Costa Unified School District, based in Richmond, from 2008 to 2012. The TV attack ad and its claim about the lawsuit refer to this period of Thurmond’s career. Here’s the full version of the ad: ""Before he was running for State Superintendent, politician Tony Thurmond was responsible for a school district with widespread budget problems. Ranked last in the state for failing to serve students of color. Sued for leaving at-risk students in rotting trailers with mushrooms growing in the floors. Reprimanded by the Obama Administration for failing to address widespread sexual harassment and assault in district schools. Tony Thurmond failed the students he was supposed to help. California deserves better.""Marshall Tuck-supporting PAC ad targeting Tony Thurmond, 2018 from EdSource on Vimeo. The ad was produced by Students, Parents and Teachers supporting Marshall Tuck, an independent expenditure group created by EdVoice, a nonprofit that supports charter schools. During the voiceover, the ad uses large text that reads: ""TONY THURMOND: Sued by the ACLU"" to relay this claim, blurring the line between Thurmond and the school district. The campaign mailer is even less subtle, using bold block letters reading: ACLU. WHY DID THE ACLU FILE A LAWSUIT AGAINST TONY THURMOND? We agreed with analysis from EdSource, a nonprofit education news group, on this misleading nature of this claim: ""The ad’s statement that Thurmond was sued over school facilities is technically accurate, in that he was named as a defendant board member in an American Civil Liberties Union’s lawsuit against West Contra Costa Unified. However, the lawsuit named every member of the school board, along with the district, its superintendent and its associate superintendent. The district’s daily management falls to its administration, not the elected board members."" Singling out Thurmond for the problems cited in the June 2012 lawsuit gives the wrong impression. He served on the board during the period cited in the suit, but was not directly responsible for the conditions. Abdi Soltani, executive director of the ACLU Foundation of Northern California, wrote in a letter to EdVoice that the foundation, not the national ACLU, filed the lawsuit. Soltani added that the foundation had nothing to do with the campaign mailer and doesn’t endorse candidates. A spokeswoman for EdVoice pointed us to a website created by the independent expenditure group backing Tuck. It repeats the same claims as the TV ad and includes a link to the lawsuit. But it doesn’t connect Thurmond directly to any of the unsafe conditions. When we asked Thurmond’s campaign about the TV spot and mailer, it pointed to groups and individuals from the NAACP to U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris and San Francisco Mayor London Breed, who have all called out the claims. In a related fact check, we rated False the claim Thurmond was ""reprimanded"" by the Obama administration Our ruling  A recent TV spot and campaign mailer by a group supporting Marshall Tuck claimed Tony Thurmond was ""sued by the ACLU.""

All five members of the district’s board, including Thurmond, were named in the lawsuit, along with the district’s administrators. The lawsuit, however, doesn’t directly tie Thurmond to any of the school conditions, which are managed daily by administrators, not board members.

Mayor Barbara Sharief says Broward County has lowest unemployment rate in Florida
","On March 21, former Florida governor Jeb Bush -- a potential Republican presidential candidate -- attracted national media attention when he gave a speech at the Broward Workshop’s annual State of the County event on March 21. Prior to Bush’s speech in Davie to business and civic leaders, Broward Mayor Barbara Sharief took a turn at the podium to tout the host county’s recent economic success. ""Our unemployment rate is at 5.3 percent, the lowest in Florida, and it has remained that way for more than a year now,"" Sharief said. We wondered whether Sharief, a Democrat from Miramar, was correct. We checked with Sharief after Bush had finished speaking, and she reiterated her claim. She said the prior month’s rate, for December 2013, fell as low as 5 percent before increasing to 5.3 percent in January 2014. ""Our rate couldn’t go lower,"" Sharief said. Sharief said her source was from the county’s public relations office, and when we asked a spokeswoman, Kimberly Maroe, she located it -- a news release from February 2014 that used the 5 percent statistic from December 2013, which was the most recent data at the time. The news release said, ""Overall Broward excelled in many areas such as low unemployment, where at 5 percent, has remained the lowest unemployment rate among large urban counties in Florida for more than a year."" But that’s not exactly what Sharief said at the Broward Workshop event. She said, ""the lowest in Florida,"" not ""the lowest in Florida among large urban counties."" Does it make a difference? Our research suggests that it does. First, we looked to see whether Broward did indeed have the lowest unemployment rate in Florida among ""large urban counties."" This requires a bit of guessing, because the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the official federal tabulator of unemployment data, doesn’t have a definition for ""large, urban counties."" But we were able to assemble a list by seeing which counties in the state ranked both in the 10 largest counties by population and the 10 most densely populated counties. Nine counties fit both requirements: Broward, Duval, Hillsborough, Lee, Miami-Dade, Orange, Palm Beach, Pinellas and Seminole. When we looked at the most recent county-level unemployment rates available from BLS, which are from December 2013, we found that Broward did indeed have the lowest among that group. So if Sharief had communicated the talking point correctly during her remarks in Davie, she would have been correct. But she didn’t, so we next looked at whether Broward’s rate was ""the lowest in Florida."" It turns out that among all of Florida’s 67 counties, Broward does pretty well in this regard -- it ranks eighth-lowest statewide -- but this doesn’t make Broward’s rate ""the lowest in Florida."" Here’s the list of Florida’s eight lowest county-wide unemployment rates for December 2013. All of the counties ranking better than Broward, with the exception of Monroe, are in the northern part of the state: 1. Monroe County: 3.5 percent 2. Walton County: 4.0 percent 3. Okaloosa County: 4.4 percent 4. St. Johns County: 4.7 percent 5. Alachua County: 4.7 percent 6. Jackson County: 4.8 percent 7. Jefferson County: 4.9 percent 8. Broward County: 5.0 percent Broward’s rate also isn’t Florida’s lowest unemployment rate for a metropolitan area, a category that BLS does track. For January 2014, the most recent month available for this statistic, the 5.3 percent unemployment rate for Fort Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-Deerfield Beach was lower than for other large metro areas, such as Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall (6.9 percent), Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater (6.5 percent), West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Boynton Beach (6.3 percent), Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford (6.0 percent) and Jacksonville (6.0 percent). But two smaller metro areas had an unemployment rate lower than metro Fort Lauderdale -- Crestview-Fort Walton Beach-Destin (5.0 percent) and Gainesville (5.1 percent). We’ll note that some experts urge against reading too much into one month’s worth of statistics. ""My strong instinct is to be skeptical of county-level data based on a single-month estimate of anything, including the unemployment rate,"" said Gary Burtless, a senior fellow with the Brookings Institution. ""My hunch is that there’s a lot of ‘noise,’ and that the amount of ‘signal’ might be questionable."" We also wondered whether there is any reason why Broward might be doing relatively well, employment-wise. Sharief gave some credit to Broward’s ordinance that encourages contractors to use local workers -- a policy implemented many years ago, but which she said is now paying off. She also said an airport expansion has helped. During Sharief’s speech, Broward County Commissioner Stacy Ritter gave a shout-out on Twitter to certain construction projects that she said were creating jobs. Mark Vitner, managing director and senior economist at Wells Fargo Securities, agreed that Fort Lauderdale’s recovery ""has gained considerable momentum over the past year, as hiring in business and professional services has picked up."" But at least some of the airport and construction in question jobs are temporary jobs. And more troublesome to independent experts is that Broward’s relatively good unemployment rate obscures other longer-term employment indicators that aren’t so rosy. Chris Lafakis, a Moody’s senior economist who tracks Florida, said that among the six largest metropolitan areas and divisions in Florida, Fort Lauderdale has been ""dead last in payroll employment growth since December 2007, which is the month the recession began."" The reason for this seemingly paradoxical situation -- a low unemployment rate despite weak employment growth -- stems from relatively slow growth in the size of the metro area’s labor force, Lafakis said. ""It’s true that projects like airport expansion are helping Broward’s economy, but the low unemployment rate is overstating strength in Broward County’s labor market,"" Lafakis said. Our ruling Sharief said Broward’s unemployment rate of 5.3 percent is ""the lowest in Florida."" The rate -- which is indeed 5.3 percent -- is the lowest in Florida among large urban counties. But it’s not the lowest in Florida. Seven counties and two smaller metropolitan areas have lower unemployment rates in the most recent data. Because she phrased her otherwise accurate talking point inaccurately in her speech, in a way that makes the county seem to be No. 1 when it's not, we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097C03FC0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/21/barbara-sharief/mayor-barbara-sharief-says-broward-county-has-lowe/

Rep. Stefani Carter twice rented margarita machines for staff parties
","A salty claim figured into a Republican challenger’s campaign before the March 4, 2014, primary for the party’s nomination for a Dallas County seat in the Texas House. Candidate Linda Koop mailed out a flier with an illustration of a festively decorated margarita machine that said incumbent Stefani Carter of Dallas ""repeatedly used her campaign contributors’ donations to rent margarita machines for our state house office."" We learned about the flier via Scott Braddock, a writer for the Capitol news website Quorum Report. As best we could tell, there’s nothing illegal about throwing a margarita party for legislative staff with campaign funds, and Koop spokesman Craig Murphy told us by phone, ""We’re not alleging that it’s illegal,"" just questioning what constituents and donors would think of the expenses. Koop faces Carter in the May 27 runoff for the Republican nomination. We decided to see whether the margarita machine charge checked out. Koop’s mailer, which Murphy said went out Feb. 25, cites ""Texas Ethics Commission records."" Murphy said the margarita expenses were revealed in Carter’s campaign contribution and expenditure reports, specifically her July 15, 2011, semi-annual report and July 15, 2013, semi-annual report. There, the campaign listed two payments to Margaritas To Go of Austin: $258.72 paid June 3, 2011, for an ""end-of-session staff/hall party"" and $117.99 paid April 1, 2013, for ""Rental of Margaritas To Go machine for staffer’s birthday."" We found no other margarita mentions in any reports filed by Carter going back to 2010, when she was elected to the House, thoughtwo liquor-store purchases were described as expenses for 2010 and 2012 campaign victory parties in Dallas. By email, Carter campaign manager Nicole Pearce said of the margarita machine events, ""Rep. Carter paid for the traditional ‘sine die’ celebration at the end of the 2011 Legislative session, as well as one birthday party for a staff member in 2013, with campaign funds, not taxpayer dollars."" Stefani Carter, July 15, 2011, semi-annual report Stefani Carter, July 15, 2013, semi-annual report: Nick Tran, owner of Margaritas to Go, said by phone that his company rents machines and sets them up for legislators, sometimes in their Capitol offices, ""once or twice a year -- it’s never the same."" Tran confirmed the 2013 rental of one machine, set up at the Capitol, but said he couldn’t find a record of the 2011 rental, which would have happened before he took over ownership. The 2011 amount, he said, equals the price of two margarita machines and two extra batches of margarita mix. Is it ethical for legislators to serve their staff members margaritas in the Capitol? Craig McDonald, director of Texans for Public Justice, a left-leaning group that tracks campaign fundraising, told us by email, ""Under current law one can supplement your staff using campaign funds. I see no legal barrier to supplementing them with a tasty margarita. The fundamental test for use of campaign funds is whether they have been converted to ‘personal use’ of you or your family. If only the family came to the party, there might be a problem."" By phone, Ian Steusloff, assistant general counsel at the Texas Ethics Commission, directed us to some of the commission’s advisory opinions that might apply: 453, 314, 458, 378, 195. We found opinions that indicated spending campaign money on an office staff party was OK and that liquor being consumed by staffers in a legislator’s office wasn’t a problem in and of itself. In a Nov. 24, 2004, opinion, the commission said a former Texas senator, who had become a U.S. ambassador, could use donations that had been given to his Texas campaign to host a holiday party for his embassy staff. An April 13, 1984, opinion said a legislator could accept ""food, liquor, and other beverages (donated) for use in his office during the session"" presuming ""these items are used by the legislator or the legislator’s staff for such activities as entertaining constituents who visit the legislator's office or for their own consumption."" Our ruling Koop said Carter ""repeatedly used her campaign contributors’ donations to rent margarita machines for our state house office."" That’s misleadingly imprecise. Twice in four years, Carter reported spending campaign money to rent margarita machines for office staff parties; using the word ""repeatedly"" risks the misimpression that Capitol employees were downing margaritas every other weekend. We rate Koop’s claim as Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096BF5100>],/factchecks/2014/mar/21/linda-koop/rep-stefani-carter-twice-rented-margarita-machines/

""What lobbyists are there for just the average worker who’s a taxpayer?"" Morris said. ""They’re economizing and buying inexpensive cuts of meat, when with (food stamps) you can buy lobster."" So, food stamp recipients can purchase lobster. Is this true? PolitiFact Georgia thought we’d put on a lobster bib and do taste-testing as we researched this claim. A medium-tail lobster costs $7 for 5 ounces at some local supermarkets, so it’s not cheap. Our bosses said lobster was not in the budget. We trudged along. Nearly one in five Georgians, about 1.7 million people, receive food stamps (a program actually called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP), and 16,000 receive welfare (called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF), according to the Georgia Department of Human Services. Many of those are children, who would not be drug-tested under the bill. A revised version of HB 772 was passed by both chambers of the Georgia Legislature on Thursday, the final day of the session. HB 772 now heads to Gov. Nathan Deal for his signature. Morris did not return a call for comment. The lawmaker’s angst may stem from several Fox News Channel reports about an aspiring musician who used the federal benefits to buy the high-end seafood. The cable outlet showed a day in the life of California resident Jason Greenslate, who was 29 and unemployed and receiving SNAP benefits when Fox News met him. His day began with surfing. Next, he discussed plans for a party with friends. After that, Greenslate made a trip to the supermarket where he bought a rainbow roll of salmon, eel and other ingredients, coconut water and lobster that Greenslate observed was ""on special."" The lobster he purchased appeared to have a sale price on the wrapper. Greenslate used his food stamp card at the checkout counter. ""All paid for by our wonderful tax dollars,"" he said on camera. Greenslate later met with three friends and cooked the lobster on a grill. ""EBT lobster,"" he said before taking a bite. Electronic Benefits Transfer is the system that transfers the federal funds to food stamp cards. The number of Americans in SNAP has more than doubled in the past decade, from about 21 million people in 2003 to nearly 48 million in 2013, U.S. Food and Drug Administration data shows. The number of SNAP recipients has risen each year since 2000. The amount of money given in benefits has more than tripled from $21 billion in 2003 to $76 billion in 2013.   Greenslate said he receives about $190 a month for food stamps, which is about $60 more than the national average benefit per person. He’s been pilloried by some of the network’s commentators for what they describe as his carefree outlook on accepting federal benefits and purchasing luxury food. In a subsequent interview, Greenslate explained he’ll buy food like lobster if he can get a deal on it. ""I’ll eat whatever is on sale,"" he said. Tales of hipsters and middle-income Americans now down on their luck buying Japanese eggplant or lemon grass with their EBT cards have been reported by news outlets in recent years. Conversely, some politicians have attempted to show the difficulty of living on food stamps by writing about the tough decisions they’ve had to make about what food to purchase. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has no restrictions on SNAP recipients buying luxury items such as steak and seafood. They also can purchase food and soft drinks that are less nutritious, such as ice cream. Alcohol, beer, cigarettes and wine are prohibited. Live animals are off the list as well. The USDA said in a 2007 report that it resisted restrictions of most foods because it says it would be difficult to regulate, considering there are more than 300,000 food products in the country. The federal agency also was worried that further restrictions would embarrass some recipients and discourage them from applying to SNAP. So are there many other food stamp recipients buying lobster? It’s unclear. Messages to the USDA were not returned. Last April, the USDA released a study of the dietary habits of some SNAP recipients once they joined the program. It found they ate more whole fruit and less of some vegetables, such as carrots. The recipients ate food with less sodium and saturated fat. It did not have a breakdown of their consumption of lobster. Most other studies found little or no change in the waistlines of recipients, contrary to thinking that food stamp use leads to obesity.    Comedian Jon Stewart said Fox News is exaggerating the scope of the situation. ""Congratulations on finding your food stamp abuse Bigfoot,"" Stewart said on his Comedy Central television show, referring to Greenslate. ""That one guy you found is certainly not someone the food stamp program itself would point to as its greatest success story. But we make fun of you not for finding him, but for pretending that he somehow represents literally millions of Americans."" To sum up, Morris said that you can buy lobster with food stamps. It’s unknown how many other food stamp recipients are cracking open this yummy seafood from its shell. As the Fox News video showed, there is at least one person receiving those federal benefits who bought lobster. The man did say he does so if it’s on sale. From what we’ve seen, there are few people buying such high-end items. But it is possible, just as Morris said. We rate his statement as True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097635A80>],/factchecks/2014/mar/21/greg-morris/food-stamp-lobster-claim-true-extent-unclear/
"['Candidate Biography', 'Texas', 'James Moore']","
Sen. Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times in his tenure, the Rio Grande Valley of Texas once
","Texan James Moore, a self-described progressive pundit and communications consultant, took note of a Texas U.S. senator's latest stop in Iowa by posting a comparative tweet on March 20, 2014. ""Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times. Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- just once,"" Moore wrote. 
 Cruz, a Republican lawyer elected to the Senate in 2012, has been flitting in and out of Iowa, home to the quadrennial party caucuses kicking off each presidential election year. We were curious whether Moore's contrast holds up, especially per the infrequency of Cruz's forays to the valley, the region closest to the state’s southeastern border with Mexico. 'Anybody will tell you' Moore, who was in McAllen when we talked to him, told us by phone that his claim -- meant to refer to Cruz’s time as a senator, he said -- was based on what Moore had heard while in the valley. ""Everybody and anybody in the valley will tell you,"" Moore said, adding that Cruz had spoken at a club and then at a border park. After emailing Cruz's office about the accuracy of Moore’s statement, we searched the Nexis database of news stories for accounts on Cruz trips to the valley and Iowa. Let’s start with the Texas mention, then count Cruz trips to Iowa. Several valley stops on Sept. 3, 2013 In Cruz’s nearly 15 months as senator, he spent a weekday in the valley, according to regional news stories. That day was Sept. 3, 2013, when Cruz spoke at a sold-out luncheon in Mission and a stop at the Anzalduas International Bridge in Mission, according to news stories posted that day by the McAllen Monitor and San Antonio Express-News. Cruz spokeswoman Catherine Frazier told us by email that Cruz did three events that day in the valley--going to McAllen for a Department of Public Safety border tour and roundtable with landowners to discuss border/immigration policy and to Mission for a ""Rio Grande Partnership"" lunch. Cruz, Frazier said, looks forward to more events in the valley, ""one specific region in the state."" ""Since being sworn in,"" she said, ""he has traveled to 38 Texas cities for 118 events."" Cruz also stumped in the valley before his election. According to a Monitor news story posted online Oct. 13, 2012, Cruz was featured at a weekend event hosted at a Mission club by the McAllen Tea Party Association. Nearly 250 people paid $25 each to attend, according to the article. Cruz said then: ""We are campaigning all across the state of Texas. From the day we started this campaign nearly two years ago, we’ve gone 18 hours a day, 7 days a week, crisscrossing the state."" Moore told us the fact that his tweet didn’t say he was speaking to Cruz’s time as senator wasn’t significant, partly because Twitter posts are limited to 140 characters. A Moore commentary published by the Huffington Post a few hours after he wrote his tweet was direct about focusing on Cruz's Senate time. Cruz, Moore wrote, ""has been to Iowa four times in the... months he has been in office but has made one appearance here in the subtropical region along the border."" Four Iowa trips Now let's look north, where news stories indicate Cruz has been to the Hawkeye State four times since joining the Senate. On Feb. 11, 2014, a Dallas Morning News news blog post datelined Washington, D.C., opened by saying Cruz ""returns to Iowa next month -- his fourth trip in eight months, ensuring ongoing speculation about his 2016 ambitions."" The newspaper made the same fourth-time-in-eight-months reference in its March 18, 2014, news story on Cruz’s appearance before the Network of Iowa Christian Home Educators. And before? Cruz made his initial senatorial trip to Iowa in July 2013, according to a July 19, 2013, Associated Press news story, giving a private speech to the conservative American Renewal Project and headlining a GOP fundraiser. A commentary by Wayne Slater of the Morning News, posted online that day, said that when reporters in Iowa inquired into Cruz’s presidential ambitions, he demurred. ""I've been in office all of seven months,"" Cruz said. ""Prior to that, the last elective office I held was student council. It's been quite a whirlwind."" The senator’s second Iowa stop occurred Aug. 10, 2013 when he spoke to hundreds of evangelical Christians and social conservatives at a summit in Ames, Iowa, according to a news story posted online that day by the Ames Tribune. Another Iowa stop, Politico reported, entailed Cruz stirring Iowa Republicans at an annual fundraising dinner Oct. 25, 2013 before heading to a pheasant hunt in the state. In an Oct. 26, 2013, news story, the Omaha World-Herald summed up: ""This was Cruz's third visit to Iowa this year..."" The 'fair comparison' On Cruz's behalf, Frazier said by email the ""fair comparison to make is that the senator has been to Iowa 4 times and travels back to Texas almost every weekend."" Our ruling Moore tweeted: ""Ted Cruz has been to Iowa four times. Rio Grande Valley of Texas -- just once."" This is correct if limited to Cruz’s year-plus as the state’s junior senator, which is what Moore made clear in his subsequent blog post. We rate this claim as True.

Ad attacking Texas Rep. Ralph Hall for age gets a historical fact wrong
","A low-profile PAC has produced an ad attacking Rep. Ralph Hall, R-Texas, a 17-term House member who is facing a tough primary runoff against former U.S. attorney John Ratcliffe. The ad’s sponsor -- the Now or Never PAC -- is going for the jugular by attacking Hall for his age. ""Ralph Hall was first elected to Congress when Jimmy Carter was president,"" the ad says. ""Now he’s 90 -- the oldest member in Congress ever. With Texas families struggling, he isn’t making a difference for us any more. Hall’s a Washington insider who’s voted for wasteful earmarks and to increase the debt ceiling. Times have changed. After 33 years, let’s bring Ralph Hall home."" The ad is correct that Hall is 90 -- he turns 91 on May 3 -- but we raised our eyebrows at the claim that Hall is ""the oldest member in Congress ever."" It is correct to say Hall is the oldest serving House member in history. According to the U.S House of Representatives, Hall passed the previous record-holder for oldest serving member in 2012 -- Charles Manly Stedman, who died in office on Sept. 23, 1930. However, as students learn in basic civics class, ""Congress"" refers to the House and the Senate. And the Senate has had four members older than Hall, according to Senate historian Donald Ritchie. They are Carl Hayden, D-Ariz., who was serving at 91; Robert Byrd, D-W.Va., who was serving at 92;  Theodore Francis Green, D-R.I., who was serving at 93; and Strom Thurmond of South Carolina, who was serving as a Republican at 100. Ritchie noted one difference between the House and Senate: ""House members stand every two years and senators every six, so of all the 90-year-old senators, only Thurmond won re-election in his 90s,"" as Hall is trying to do. Still, that’s not what the ad said. Our ruling The Now or Never PAC ad said Hall is ""the oldest member in Congress ever."" That’s not correct -- four members of Congress, all of them senators, have served at a more advanced age than Hall. So we rate the claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F14DC0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/20/now-or-never-pac/ad-attacking-texas-rep-ralph-hall-age-gets-histori/

Drudge links to report claiming White House press briefings are 'show'
","The Drudge Report, a conduit of conservative news, threw a wrench in the daily ritual of the White House press briefing. That’s when reporters pepper White House spokesman Jay Carney with questions. Drudge gave top billing to an item in the Weekly Standard, posted by online editor Daniel Halper. In Halper’s article, the headline said it all: ""Reporter: WH press secretary gets questions from reporters before press briefing: It’s just a show."" Halper didn’t write too much more. Mainly, he inserted a video of a reporter from an Arizona CBS affiliate talking about what she learned on her visit to the White House. The reporter, Catherine Anaya, said Carney told her that the questions correspondents ask ""are provided to him in advance. So then he knows what he's going to be answering and sometimes those correspondents and reporters also have those answers printed in front of them."" Drudge’s headline -- at the top of its page -- meant the news quickly spread through other websites and Twitter (likely making for a good traffic day at weeklystandard.com).  Then came the rebuttal. Carney tweeted, ""Briefings would be a lot easier if this were true! Rest assured, it is not."" We got in touch with Anaya, and she let us know in an email that she had confused the matter. Basically, she had a question for President Barack Obama that was of more local than national interest. She had the option to submit it in advance, and she got that muddied with how the usual press briefings take place. ""I was attempting to not waste national time on a local question but in my attempt at explaining that I unintentionally made it sound like that experience applied to everyone,"" Anaya said. ""That is my mistake and I own up to it."" Anaya’s station, CBS 5 News, also released a statement (from Anaya) saying she didn’t know the process for White House regulars. The statement was removed from the station’s website, but a copy is available here. The station says they are working on reissuing a statement. We’ll update this post when it’s available. Update: Here is the CBS 5 statement, issued by Anaya. ""Last night during my live reports from the White House I attempted to describe the highlights of the day. I was speaking off the cuff and unscripted and in the process I made two major mistakes: I reported an off the record conversation and what I reported was not accurate. I took a conversation about the preparation for a press briefing and muddied it with my own experience of wanting to provide a question for the press briefing. I incorrectly applied the process to everyone. That was wrong and it was bad reporting. But it was not intentional and I would never purposely report inaccurate information. The White House never asked for my questions in advance and never instructed me what to ask. I chose to provide one of my questions in advance of the press briefing because I wanted to make sure it would have broad appeal. I did not attribute or report factually last night and for that I deeply apologize. I pride myself on truth and objectivity. I sincerely regret any harm I've caused and I hope that you will We asked White House reporters if they are ever asked to send in their questions, and get replies, before the actual briefings. In one form or another, they all said, no way. (We also created a video attached to this fact-check that shows some of the interactions between Carney and the press corps.) Steve Thomma, senior White House correspondent for McClatchy and president of the White House Correspondents Association said, ""I've never heard of a scripted set up before a briefing."" CNN’s Jake Tapper, host of The Lead and veteran of many daily briefings, had a wry response: ""The press briefing is not where you go to get clear and candid answers,"" Tapper said. ""In terms of this bizarre meme that was birthed – no, I have never in any way submitted questions ahead of time to anyone at the White House for any reason."" NPR White House correspondent Scott Horsley was also bemused. ""This story has generated some pained smiles today in the White House press room,"" Horsley said. Horsley explained that reporters ask plenty of questions outside of the briefings and so the press office staff will know what’s on their minds. If a longer term reporting story is in play, Horsley will tell the White House staff what he needs to know. ""But as a general rule, the briefings are not scripted that way. If they were, they could be a lot shorter,"" Horsley said. We emailed the editors of the Weekly Standard but did not hear back. Halper, when confronted on Twitter by Fox News White House correspondent Ed Henry (who called the story ""dead wrong""), said he was just reporting what Anaya said.  Drudge eventually updated its website, linking to a different article from Daily Mail with the headline, ""UPDATE: Reporter retracts story, says Press Sec doesn't get questions in advance..."" Our ruling The Drudge Report gave top billing to the claim that the daily White House press briefings are ""just a show,"" with questions submitted and answered in advance. That claim relied on the report of a television anchor in Arizona. But the Drudge Report did all it could to make the statement go viral. Accountability applies as much to spreading information, especially for a website as popular as the Drudge Report, as it does to the journalist who wrote the article. The reporter behind Halper’s article now says she made a mistake and really doesn’t know what happens in the briefings. She was considering asking a question about a local issue and wanted to know if it would be appropriate to ask at the regular press briefing. She opted to save the question for her interview with Obama. According to Carney and the reporters whom he faces daily, this scenario in no way matches up with their experiences. Halper took a shaky report and drew a strong conclusion without proof. Drudge put that claim on steroids. We rate this statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975572C0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/20/drudge-report/drudge-links-report-claiming-white-house-press-bri/

Americans for Prosperity claims people are getting less at a higher cost under Obamacare
","Americans for Prosperity has been active on the airwaves already this election cycle. The group, which opposes Obamacare, has run a handful of ads featuring people telling health care ""horror stories"" meant to tug on the heartstrings. We’ve looked at a couple and explained how they can be misleading.   But a pair of new ads take an entirely different tack to undercut support from Democratic Sens. Mary Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Udall of Colorado. (It has also run against Sen. Kay Hagan, D-N.C., and Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Ark.) In these ads, a woman on screen trashes political ads in her 30-second personal pitch. ""People don’t like political ads. I don’t like them either. But health care isn’t about politics,"" she says. ""It’s about people. And millions of people have lost their health insurance, millions of people can’t see their own doctors, and millions are paying more and getting less."" We’ve tackled claims about lost insurance and access to personal doctors before. But we haven’t heard someone say that the health care law is causing people to pay more for less, so we decided to check it out. Paying more There are a lot of factors in the health care law — and health insurance in general — that make it difficult to pin down whether people are paying more or less for coverage. In general, insurance premiums were increasing every year well before Obamacare became law. In fact, rates have increased consistently during the last 15 years. But there are signs that the rate of the increase has declined since the law was passed. Kaiser Family Foundation, for example, surveyed people who purchase insurance through their employer. Here are the average annual cost of premiums:   Year Single % increase Family % increase 1999 $2,196 $5,791 2000 $2,471 12.52% $6,438 11.17% 2001 $2,689 8.82% $7,061 9.68% 2002 $3,083 14.65% $8,003 13.34% 2003 $3,383 9.73% $9,068 13.31% 2004 $3,695 9.22% $9,950 9.73% 2005 $4,024 8.90% $10,880 9.35% 2006 $4,242 5.42% $11,480 5.51% 2007 $4,479 5.59% $12,106 5.45% 2008 $4,704 5.02% $12,680 4.74% 2009 $4,824 2.55% $13,375 5.48% 2010 $5,049 4.66% $13,770 2.95% 2011 $5,429 7.53% $15,073 9.46% 2012 $5,615 3.43% $15,745 4.46% 2013 $5,884 4.79% $16,351 3.85%   Other than a sharp increase between 2010 to 2011, the Obama years have experienced the smallest rate increases of the last 14 years. Throughout much of the early 2000s, premium increases of 9 percent or more were the norm. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid also found a slowdown in the increase in health costs during the last four years, including a modest 4 percent increase from 2011 to 2012. The government attributed the decrease in health costs to the economic downturn. Kaiser, too, said the recession accounted for much of the decline, though they said the health care law may have played a role, too. Because of the law, people making up to 400 percent of the federal poverty level are now eligible for subsidies to buy insurance, and for many of them, costs are going down. Those costs are capped at a percent of their income. But some people may see rate increases on existing policies or as they transition to new plans. Insurers can no longer deny individuals with pre-existing conditions, and there is now a much larger pool of people looking to purchase coverage. For younger, healthier people, this means they are now taking on some of the financial burden so older or sick people can buy insurance at a reasonable price. (This is especially true for young males, since young women were often charged more, and even more so if they don’t qualify for premium subsidies.) There were also people who previously purchased very cheap plans. But those policies provided very little coverage or capped their benefits at low levels, which the new health care law bars. So they’re getting more coverage, albeit at a greater cost. Getting less? Which gets us to our next point. We found it strange that the ad claimed that people are getting less under the Affordable Care Act. In fact, we’ve usually heard the opposite from critics of the law that people are now paying for types of coverage they don’t need. The favorite example is single men who now will now have maternity coverage if they buy a plan on the individual market. In October 2013, Rep. Renee Ellmers, R-N.C., grilled Secretary of Health and Human Services Kathleen Sebelius on this very point. ""An insurance policy has a series of benefits whether you use them or not,"" Sebelius said during her testimony on the Hill. ""And that is why the health care premiums are increasing this high,"" Ellmers said. ""We’re forcing them to buy things that they will never need."" ""Individual policies cover families. Men often do need maternity coverage for their spouses and for their families,"" Sebelius responded. ""To the best of your knowledge, has a man ever delivered a baby?"" Elmers asked. The discussion ended there. So are you getting less coverage, or getting more than you need? We asked Americans for Prosperity to clarify their position. ""Getting less speaks to a multitude of data points that has been America's Obamacare experience so far: botched website, shrinking provider networks, a string of broken promises, missed deadlines, and unilateral rule changes that have kept the entire country in limbo ever since this debacle rolled out,"" said spokesman Levi Russell. That’s a pretty ambiguous definition of ""less."" We think most people would assume ""less"" is referring to the amount of coverage or benefits under the law. Americans are getting more benefits under the law in a number of ways -- including, in some cases, being able to buy affordable insurance for the first time. In addition, insurance purchased in the individual and small group marketplace must meet 10 essential health benefits. This includes coverage for emergency services and hospitalization, prescription drugs, free preventative coverage for things ranging from basic immunizations to HIV screening, and maternity care. The law also caps out-of-pocket costs, providing greater protection from exorbitant hospital bills. The most a person could pay for health care in a year is $6,300; the most a family can pay is $12,600. Before the law passed, some insurers capped annual or lifetime benefits, forcing people who thought they were covered to pay large hospital bills once they passed the threshold. People with pre-existing conditions are also seeing a lot more benefits, since they previously couldn’t buy a policy at all. So it’s a tough sell to say millions are getting less. And for many, they aren’t paying more, either. Our ruling Americans for Prosperity said ""millions are paying more and getting less"" under Obamacare. We found their explanation of ""less"" rather dubious. Most people on the individual market are getting more benefits under the law. At worst, they’re paying more to get more, though in many cases they’re actually paying less. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F20800>],/factchecks/2014/mar/20/americans-prosperity/americans-prosperity-claims-people-are-getting-les/
"['Children', 'Education', 'Florida', 'Rick Scott']","
Rick Scott says Florida's VPK is No. 1 in the country for access
","In a photo any candidate for re-election would crave, Gov. Rick Scott is seated alongside a couple of cute pre-kindergarten kids at a science museum as a girl chews on her fingers and a boy reaches in a container for a crayon. Scott was at the the Science and Discovery Center of Northwest Florida in Panama City on March 12, 2014, to tout funding for the state’s voluntary pre-kindergarten program, known as VPK. A few days later, he boasted about VPK in a tweet: ""Florida ranks first in the nation for access to free prekindergarten. We need to keep it that way."" Scott, a Republican, is expected to face former Gov. Charlie Crist, now a Democrat, in November. Education has become a hot topic in the race and PolitiFact Florida has previously fact-checked claims about K-12 and higher education. Here we decided to explore Scott’s claim about the state’s ranking on access to VPK. Report comparing states on preschool Florida’s VPK program launched in 2005 as a result of voters approving an amendment to provide free access to all of the state’s 4-year-olds to prepare them for kindergarten. Students learn how to identify shapes and colors, write their own name, recognize letters and recognize patterns, among other skills. The program is offered at public schools and private day care centers. Children can enroll in a school-year program that totals 540 hours. That typically translates to three hours a day during the school year -- though many parents pay for additional ""wrap-around"" hours. Parents can also elect a summer program of 300 hours instead of the school year. The National Institute for Early Education Research, a unit of the Graduate School of Education at Rutgers, publishes an annual State Preschool Yearbook that has tracked the funding, access, and policies of state-funded pre-school programs since the 2001-02 school year. We looked at the rankings for Florida, which was compared against programs in 40 states during the 2011-12 school year. (The next report is expected in April.) The report ranked the states on the following criteria: Access. Florida ranked No. 1 for serving 4-year-olds with 79 percent of the eligible population served in 2012. Participation has grown rapidly from about 100,000 students in 2005 to 175,000 in 2011-12. The program remains optional, so it may not continue to grow much higher in terms of the percentage served. State spending. Florida ranked No. 35 for state spending. The amount of state funding per student dropped from $2,755 in 2008 to $2,281 in 2012, according to the report. The state’s Office of Early Learning had a slightly different figure because it provides a per-pupil amount for the school year and a lower one for the summer. In 2010-11 -- the budget set before Scott was elected -- the per-pupil school year amount was $2,562. Then under Scott it dropped to $2,383 where it has stayed for three years. Scott has proposed a $100 increase. Quality benchmarks. Florida meets only three of the 10 benchmarks -- those related to early learning standards, class size and site monitoring. It did not meet benchmarks that related to teacher degrees, specialized training and other areas. Florida and Ohio both met three benchmarks. Only one state met fewer (Texas with two). Experts weigh in on Florida’s VPK program So what’s the big picture about Florida’s VPK program? Does it make sense for Scott to boast about access when the state lags behind in per-pupil spending and quality benchmarks? Many states face the tradeoff between broad access and commitment to quality, said Daphna Bassok, an expert in early childhood education and assistant professor at the University of Virginia. ""Overall, Florida’s program is characterized by very high access but relatively low quality, as far as quality standards, length of school day, dollars per child,"" and other issues, she told PolitiFact Florida. Another expert said that the benchmarks set by the National Institute for Early Education Research, or NIEER, are subjective measures of quality. Grover (Russ) Whitehurst, a former U.S. Education Department official under President George W. Bush and a fellow at the Brookings Institution, noted that one benchmark requires programs to provide one meal a day. But that doesn’t make sense for a program such as Florida’s that offers three hours a day. ""Access and state spending are based on hard data, whereas the NIEER benchmarks are nothing more than the opinion of NIEER, an advocacy organization,"" Whitehurst told PolitiFact Florida. ""I place little stock in the NIEER benchmarks."" Scott’s spokeswoman referred us to the state’s Office of Early Learning for a response. ""When it comes to the benchmarks that NIEER uses to rank states for quality and spending, we believe that the most important benchmark is not included,"" spokeswoman Cynthia Sucher told PolitiFact Florida. ""How well does VPK prepare Florida 4-year-olds for kindergarten?"" Assessments done by public school districts once students enter kindergarten show that almost 82 percent of children who completed a VPK program were ready for kindergarten, compared to about 53 percent of those who did not participate in VPK in 2013. That was the fifth consecutive year of an increase in the preparedness rate for those that completed VPK. But that data isn’t compelling, some say, because there are likely differences in the backgrounds and abilities between the two groups. Non-attendees may be poorer or have parents who don’t speak English, Whitehurst said. That makes it difficult to draw conclusions that it's the program that's causing better outcomes. ""The present evidence that Florida's VPK is having a positive impact on school readiness and later academic achievement is weak to nonexistent,"" he said. ""This doesn't mean it isn't having a positive impact. Rather, it means that the impact is presently unknown."" Our ruling Scott said, ""Florida ranks first in the nation for access to free prekindergarten."" A national education group ranked Florida No. 1 in access for 4-year-olds during the 2011-12 school year, the most recent year available. However, the same report ranked Florida 35th in state spending per pupil. The report also concluded that the state only met three of 10 benchmarks, though it’s possible for education experts to quibble about the value of those benchmarks. Scott was careful with his wording because he only mentioned ""access,"" but the rest of the report’s findings may provide a different picture of Florida’s VPK program. His statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate his statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097711500>],/factchecks/2014/mar/20/rick-scott/rick-scott-says-floridas-vpk-no-1-country-access/

Greenlight Pinellas means a '300% tax increase,' No Tax For Tracks says
","Now that the special election to fill the late U.S. Rep. Bill Young’s open House seat has concluded, Pinellas County can get back to worrying about other issues -- like the fledgling mass transit initiative called Greenlight Pinellas. Not everyone is a fan of the expanded transportation plan, with the activist group No Tax For Tracks being its most vocal opponent. ""Greenlight Pinellas is nothing but an attempt to put a Happy Face on a 300 percent Tax increase and Money Grab,"" the group’s website, RailTaxFacts.com trumpets as a counterpoint to the plan. A 300 percent tax increase sounds like pretty hefty fee to build a light rail line and add more buses. We decided to look into the claim and find out if the county really would be taken for a ride. Taxes vs. revenues Greenlight Pinellas is a countywide transportation initiative that proposes expanding bus service throughout the county -- by adding routes in northern Pinellas and extending hours -- as well as adding a 24-mile light rail line between St. Petersburg and Clearwater. The entire plan hinges on whether Pinellas voters on Nov. 4 approve a sales tax increase from 7 percent to 8 percent, making the county’s sales tax rate the highest in the state. The higher sales tax would replace the Pinellas Suncoast Transit Authority’s current county funding, a property tax assessed at a 0.7305 millage rate. The sales tax would only go up on items already subject to the sales tax; Florida has a long list of items that are not taxed, such as medicine, groceries, certain agricultural and manufacturing startup equipment. It also would be limited to the first $5,000 of major purchases. The change would take effect Jan. 1, 2016. If it’s adopted, any future changes to the Greenlight plan, such as an extension of the proposed rail line, would be subject to a referendum. The new sales tax is projected to increase the authority’s budget from its current $34 million per year to about $120 million to $130 million, said Bob Lasher, the agency’s external affairs officer. This is the source of No Tax For Tracks’ claim that the tax revenue expansion amounts to ""a 300% tax increase."" The group argues that not only is the plan’s feasibility suspect, but the increase in the authority’s budget is unconscionable. ""What we’re asserting is that their revenue will increase 300 percent,"" No Tax For Tracks spokeswoman Barb Haselden told PolitiFact Florida. ""They’re broadening their budget with a tax increase on the non-homeowner poor. … It’s a regressive tax that is not necessary."" How much would the percent increase actually be for individual taxpayers? Greenlight Pinellas illustrates its plan using Census averages from 2008 to 2012, taking as a case study a median-family home in Pinellas County, which costs about $161,000. Under that scenario, the portion of property taxes that goes to the transit authority today is just less than $90. Greenlight also looks at a median-income family with two children earning about $46,000. Using the IRS sales tax deduction calculator, Greenlight concluded that this family will pay about $800 in sales taxes annually at the new 8 percent rate, about $104 more per year than they paid under the 7 percent rate. Under the plan, a family that owns a $161,000 home and makes about $46,000 would stop paying the $90 share of the property tax destined for the transit authority, but it would instead pay $104 in additional sales taxes. Allowing some uncertainty for the exact mix of taxed and tax-exempt purchases, that’s a tax hike of about 15 percent. The increase in dollars in this example is pretty modest -- $14 more per year. Other residents, however, could face heftier impacts. County residents who currently don’t own real estate won’t benefit from the authority’s switch from property tax revenue to sales tax revenue, so if they owe $104 in additional sales taxes, that won’t be offset by tax reductions. Still, on a percentage basis, that’s an increase in sales tax burden of about 14 percent. In other words, it’s not correct to call either of these examples of increases a ""300% tax increase."" No Tax For Tracks actually gets the talking point correct elsewhere on its website, saying, ""Now PSTA wants to 'replace' the property tax by increasing our sales tax from 7 percent to 8 percent. That’s a 14 percent increase! To convince us to vote 'Yes', they are calling it a 'Tax Swap'."" The ruling No Tax For Tracks says Greenlight Pinellas will balloon the transit authority’s budget by imposing ""a 300% tax increase."" That number comes from an estimated increase in the transit authority’s operating budget from $32 million to about $130 million per year. But that’s an increase in revenues to the agency, not an increase in the tax rate to individual taxpayers. In reality, no group would face a 300 percent increase. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280966C9680>],/factchecks/2014/mar/20/no-tax-tracks/greenlight-pinellas-means-300-tax-increase-no-tax-/

Wendy Davis overstates how much full-time working women make in Texas compared to men
","Texas women are paid less than men, Wendy Davis stresses. In a March 10, 2014, tweet, the Democratic gubernatorial nominee pointed out that her Republican opponent, Attorney General Greg Abbott, passed up a chance to say whether he would have vetoed a Davis-sponsored measure related to ensuring equal pay for Texas women that didn’t make it into law. Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, wrote: ""While @GregAbbott_TX dodges questions on the Texas Equal Pay Act, women are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in Texas."" We’ll leave it to Abbott and Davis to debate the 2013 measure vetoed by Gov. Rick Perry. But we wondered: Are Texas women still paid 82 cents for every dollar earned by a man? We found that pay gaps persist, though comparisons can be dicey. Comparing women and men doing 'same' job In August 2013, we rated as Mostly False a related Davis claim: ""Texas women make an average of $8,355 less per year than men doing the very same job."" That’s not necessarily correct for individuals doing the same job. In 2010, $8,355 was the general gap between median salaries of full-time working Texas men and women, according to federal estimates, and the 2012 gap was nearly $500 less than that. Significantly, the research cited by Davis did not drill down to salaries for men and women doing the same jobs. In contrast, 2013 survey results indicated a $2,000 gap between the median pay for Texas men and women with comparable professional experiences holding the same or similar jobs. Annual U.S. Census Bureau surveys But Davis’ recent ""82 cents"" claim wasn’t specific to people doing the same jobs. Responding to our request for back-up information, Davis spokeswoman Rebecca Acuña pointed us to an April 2013 ""fact sheet"" from the National Partnership for Women & Families, an advocacy group for workplace fairness and other issues. The sheet opens: ""In Texas, on average, a woman who holds a full-time job is paid $35,301 per year while a man who holds a full-time job is paid $43,160 per year. This means that women in Texas are paid 82 cents for every dollar paid to men, amounting to a yearly gap of $7,859 between men and women who work full time in the state."" That statement is footnoted to the one-year American Community Survey undertaken in 2011 by the U.S Census Bureau and a bureau chart indicating median earnings in the past 12 months by sex by work experience for residents 16 and older. These aligned with the partnership’s fact sheet. Latest available estimate Kliner pointed out, too, that comparable results based on the 2012 ACS were posted online by the bureau in September 2013. The 2012 estimates indicate that median earnings for Texas men who worked full time year-round in the past 12 months were $44,802; for Texas women meeting these criteria, median earnings were $35,453 — or 79 cents for every dollar earned by men who worked full time. Because Davis said women ""still"" earned 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, we calculated the comparable figure for previous years, according to the bureau’s surveys. We found the comparable figure to be 80 cents in 2006, 2009 and 2010, 79 cents in 2007 and 78 cents in 2008. Separately, we downloaded a bureau chart showing slightly different estimated median earnings for full-time male and female civilian workers in Texas based on the bureau’s 2012 survey. The resulting chart indicated a median wage for full-time working men of--$45,166 for men, $35,518 for women. By this metric, we calculated, civilian full-time female workers in Texas earned an estimated 79 cents for each dollar earned by full-time male workers. In 2011, a bureau chart suggests, the comparable figure was 81 cents. Kliner told us the partnership relies on bureau estimates not limited to civilian workers because it believes that delivers a more complete view of the workforce. ""It is also the chart that has been used historically, so it allows for comparisons over time,"" she wrote. Upshot: The latest available estimate is that Texas women working full time earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by such men in 2012. That was a penny better than in one of the previous six years, the same or a penny less than the result in four of the years and three cents less than the 82 cents estimated for 2011 and relied upon by Davis. Experts note caveats Experts we queried agreed with our math while offering caveats. By email, Lloyd Potter, the state demographer, pointed out that any focus on earnings for full-time workers leaves out part-time workers. Women, he wrote, are more likely to be employed part-time. Still, Potter said, ""if we just looked at part-time workers, again, you’d probably find women earn less."" In our 2013 fact check, we noted there’s a range of how many hours full-time workers log, and men are more likely than women to be on the job for 41 hours or more per week, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Because more men work overtime, that should translate into higher earnings for them -- because they are paid more, or because their longer hours lead to more job success -- and contribute to the wage gap. Though more nuanced analysis shows that job differences explain much of the pay gap, experts agree that much of it still cannot be accounted for. That’s where sexism comes in, some say. ""Finally,"" Potter said, ""the differential quoted probably is not adjusted for educational attainment or work experience."" It is not. ""If it were, we’d probably find the differential would shrink (toward equality) as women tend to have less work experience than men though educational attainment is fairly comparable among adults across sex."" Austin economist Stuart Greenfield similarly said by email: ""In the aggregate, Sen. Davis’ statement is absolutely, positively correct,"" though he said that ""when one controls for work experience, education, and other factors, the earnings’ differential is reduced."" National comparisons Greenfield also pointed out a Dec. 2, 2013, Bureau of Labor Statistics press release summarizing median-pay changes among full-time workers over the years: ""In Texas, the ratio of women’s to men’s earnings trended upward from 1997 to 2004. It then fluctuated from 2005 to 2009 before climbing to a series high of 85.6 percent in 2010. However, in the last two years the Texas women’s to men’s earnings ratio has declined 6.0 percentage points to its lowest level since 2001."" According to the 2012 survey results, Texas women fared better compared to men in their state than women in 24 states. Arizona placed first; women working full time earned 87 cents for every dollar earned by men.(For more than a decade, the graph indicates, Texas women fared better than their male counterparts in the state compared to women versus men in the nation as a whole, though conditions dipped in Texas compared to the nation in 2011 and 2012. We asked Cheryl Abbot, a regional economist for the Bureau of Labor Statistics, to speak to why this was so. See her reply here.)
 Jennifer Lee, a researcher for the left-leaning Center for Public Policy Priorities, which focuses on programs serving low-income Texans, said of the 79-cent pay difference estimate suggested by the 2012 survey: ""This is how the ‘wage gap’ is usually calculated. If you expand who you’re looking at to include all employed individuals (whether or not they work full-time or year-round), women earn 71 cents for every dollar that a man earns,"" Lee said by email. Lee reminded us of a February 2007 paper by Cornell University labor economists Francine Blau and Lawrence Kahn, ""The Gender Pay Gap: Have Women Gone Far Enough?"" The paper states that 53 percent of the gender wage gap stems from variation in job, industry and union status between the genders. According to the paper, major reasons for such wage gaps include: Occupational and industry category (49% of the reason) – Lee said that many women are concentrated in particular occupations. Occupations that are heavily female, such as health care support or personal care and service occupations, tend to pay low wages, she said. For example, home health aides in Texas, who are largely female, earn on average $17,430 per year, Lee said, while women also represent 63% of workers earning minimum-wage or less in Texas. When you break down earnings data by occupation, she said, this gap persists in almost all occupations. Labor Force Experience (10.5%) – A portion of the gap is explained by factors related to work experience, such as interruptions in work for child care, Lee said. Unexplained (41%) – Lee said a large portion of the gap is unexplained by women’s choices. This could be because of conscious or unconscious biases (research shows this is particularly acute against mothers), Lee wrote, while other research shows that different attitudes around wage negotiations may contribute to the gender wage gap. Lee added: ""A lot of people see occupational choices and time off from work as women’s choices. And while this is true, I think it’s important to realize that the choices we make are heavily influenced by the environment in which we make choices, the choices that are available, and how those choices are presented. So while it’s true that more women work in low-wage jobs, there may be reasons why women don’t choose to work in some higher-wage occupations. Similarly, mothers may choose to take time off work to care for young children, but perhaps they wouldn’t if child care were more available or affordable."" Our ruling Davis said that Texas women are still paid 82 cents for every dollar a man earns in the state. Her figure, based on a 2011 federal survey, reflects median earnings for adults who worked full time in the past 12 months, leaving out part-time workers. It’s also outdated in that according to the latest available survey, taken in 2012, Texas women earned 79 cents for every dollar earned by men (again working full time in the past 12 months), less than what Davis said. We rate this claim as Mostly True. MOSTLY TRUE – The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Chris Larson: GOP-led Wisconsin Senate denying veterans legal rights in cancer cases
","On March 12, 2014, the Republican-controlled Wisconsin state Senate approved several pieces of legislation that dismayed Democrats. The same day, Senate Minority Leader Chris Larson of Milwaukee pounced on three of the bills, citing them in a fund-raising email he sent on behalf of a committee that works to elect Democrats to the Senate. One of the bills, Larson wrote, is ""denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country."" Fund-raising letters often make startling claims, like ""denying"" rights. Let’s see how this one does on the Truth-O-Meter. The bill The bill Larson cites is due for a vote in the state Assembly on March 20, 2014. Gov. Scott Walker has not said whether he would sign it. The bill would change requirements for anyone who files a lawsuit claiming they contracted an illness, often cancer, as a result of exposure to asbestos. So, despite Larson’s claim, the bill does not target veterans. That being said, veterans, particularly those who served in the Navy, make up a large percentage of people with mesothelioma, one type of cancer caused by asbestos exposure. Some studies show that as many as 30 percent of all Americans with mesothelioma cancer are veterans who were exposed while on active duty, according to Mesothelioma.com. There are two ways that a person with asbestos-related cancer can seek to recover money for their medical costs and other damages: 1. File a lawsuit against a company that manufactured or used asbestos. 2. File a claim with one or more trusts that were set up by now-bankrupt companies to pay victims of asbestos-related illnesses. Under the bill, cancer victims suing an existing company would have to disclose whether they have also filed a claim with any of the asbestos trusts. And if they haven’t already done so, the judge handling the lawsuit could order them to file a claim with one or more of the trusts. Under that scenario, if the lawsuit is resolved in a settlement or at trial and it is determined that the cancer victim be paid damages, the parties or the jury could determine how much should be paid by the existing business being sued and how much, if any, should be paid by trusts. Opponents of the bill worry that a veteran could end up collecting less money, because the funds in some trusts have been depleted, while supporters see the possible apportionment of blame as a matter of fairness. Before we close, a little more from each side: -- Opponents of the bill include the American Legion, Wisconsin Veterans of Foreign Wars and the Military Order of the Purple Heart. They say the the bill could delay a trial for six months or more -- and given that Mesothelioma victims typically die within about a year or less of being diagnosed, a veteran could become incapacitated or die before the trial, hurting the chances of the veteran or the veteran’s family to collect damages. Moreover, if a jury decides an existing business is responsible for damages, the veteran stands a strong chance of collecting a full amount. But if the jury decides that a trust is responsible for some of the damages, it’s possible the veteran wouldn’t collect that entire amount because some trusts are depleted. -- Supporters of the bill include the National Federation of Independent Business, Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce and the AMVETS veterans group. They say there wouldn’t be any significant delays in asbestos trials because attorneys representing cancer victims would know before filing any lawsuit that they also have to file a claim with an asbestos trust. And even now, it can take up to a year before an asbestos lawsuit goes to trial, so many veterans videotape their testimony in case they die before the trial begins. The supporters also say the bill would stop so-called double dipping: a cancer victim collecting damages from the company they sue and then filing claims for more money with one or more of the trusts. Double dipping arguably depletes funds available for other cancer victims who have legitimate claims. Our rating Larson said the Republican-controlled Wisconsin Senate approved a bill ""denying veterans the right to recover their medical costs for cancers they developed while serving their country."" The bill does not target veterans and does not deny their right to seek compensation, both from existing and now-bankrupt asbestos-related companies, for cancer they contracted as a result of serving in the military. But Larson’s claim contains an element of truth, in that the bill could result in some veterans collecting less money from legal actions than they could under the current system for seeking compensation. We rate Larson’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F22800>],/factchecks/2014/mar/20/chris-larson/wisconsin-democratic-leader-chris-larson-says-gop-/
"['Foreign Policy', 'PunditFact', 'Facebook posts']","
The United States spent $5 billion on Ukraine anti-government riots
","It’s a conspiracy with mainstream crossover: The United States bankrolled the bloody political uprising in Ukraine. We saw the claim pop up recently in a story on RT (the Russian-funded English language cable network), and found lots of talk about it on reddit, Facebook and other websites. The claims have the same basic structure. While President Barack Obama publicly said Ukrainians have the right to determine their own future, the U.S. government pumped $5 billion into the country to promote regime change. In a Facebook meme, someone put it this way: Obama ""spends $5 billion paying Ukrainians to riot and dismantle their democratically elected government."" So is there any truth to this claim? PunditFact dove in. The roots The claim is rooted in a December 2013 speech by Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs Victoria Nuland to the U.S.-Ukraine Foundation, a non-governmental agency that promotes democracy in the former Soviet republic. Nuland had returned days earlier from her third trip to Ukraine in five weeks to assess the protests over President Viktor Yanukovych’s policies to move away from the European Union, she said. She made clear the United States supported the protesters’ fight and spoke of how she met with Yanukovych, pressing him to end the pushback from Ukrainian security forces because it is ""absolutely impermissible in a European state, in a democratic state."" She described how American taxpayer money has supported Ukraine’s democratic development despite the country’s challenges. ""Since Ukraine's independence in 1991, the United States has supported Ukrainians as they build democratic skills and institutions, as they promote civic participation and good governance, all of which are preconditions for Ukraine to achieve its European aspirations,"" she said. ""We have invested over $5 billion to assist Ukraine in these and other goals that will ensure a secure and prosperous and democratic Ukraine."" Her eight-minute speech (video) attracted little to no media attention. The truth We had a feeling that folks repeating the claim missed important context from Nuland’s speech. Wasn’t Nuland talking about money given since Ukraine broke away from the Soviet Union? The State Department said yes. ""The insinuation that the United States incited the people of Ukraine to riot or rebel is patently false,"" said Nicole Thompson, a State Department spokeswoman. Since 1992, the government has spent about $5.1 billion to support democracy-building programs in Ukraine, Thompson said, with money flowing mostly from the Department of State via U.S. Agency for International Development, as well as the departments of Defense, Energy, Agriculture and others. The United States does this with hundreds of other countries. About $2.4 billion went to programs promoting peace and security, which could include military assistance, border security, human trafficking issues, international narcotics abatement and law enforcement interdiction, Thompson said. More money went to categories with the objectives of ""governing justly and democratically"" ($800 million), ""investing in people"" ($400 million), economic growth ($1.1 billion), and humanitarian assistance ($300 million). The descriptions are a bit vague, which could lead people to think the money was used for some clandestine purpose. But even if it that were so, the money in question was spent over more than 20 years. Yanukovych was elected in 2010. So any connection between the protests and the $5 billion is inaccurate. And Obama was elected in 2008, so any connection between $5 billion and Obama also is inaccurate. The challenge We attempted to drill down and verify the expenditures independently but found that a difficult task. That’s a byproduct of the United States’ foreign aid investments, which rival no other country (though supporters note the spending equals only 1 percent of all federal spending). The massive check-writing across dozens of agencies to non-governmental organizations to scores of countries and regions around the world is almost impossible to untangle. ""As it stands, it is nearly impossible to find a figure,"" said Nicole Valentinuzzi, communications manager of Publish What You Fund, a group that pushes for aid transparency across the world. ""These kinds of things would be easily verifiable if people were given timely information."" The State Department created ForeignAssistance.gov to help taxpayers, journalists and others find out where the money is going, but the data is limited in the number of years available and not reported by all agencies. ""The Foreign Assistance dashboard is not capturing this information in an up-to-date, current way,"" Valentinuzzi said, ""so responding to a humanitarian crisis is a bit untraceable while it happens, which we argue makes it less effective, basically."" That said, the United States is working on being more transparent. The site started under the Obama administration and is a ""work in progress,"" Thompson said. Eight agencies, such as U.S. AID, Millennium Challenge Corporation and the Treasury Department, have begun posting planning and spending data to the site. Still, 14 agencies, including the departments of Agriculture, Energy, Transportation, and Health and Human Services, have not. From that website, we calculated the United States spent $456.4 million in Ukraine since 2009. Again, that’s an incomplete picture based on incomplete data reporting. Some examples? The United States spent about $20 million on Peace Corps programs in Ukraine over the past four years. It spent about $40 million through U.S. AID on health programs in the countries since 2010 -- fighting HIV/AIDs, malaria and providing for maternal and child health. The United States spent an additional $80 million or so working on projects related to weapons of mass destruction, according to ForeignAssistance.gov. Our ruling Contrary to claims, the United States did not spend $5 billion to incite the rebellion in Ukraine. That’s a distorted understanding of remarks given by a State Department official. She was referring to money spent on democracy-building programs in Ukraine since it broke off from the Soviet Union in 1991.

Karl Rove says George W. Bush had a more muscular stance against Putin in 2008 Georgia crisis than Barack Obama has had over Crimea
","Some Republicans have been critical of President Barack Obama’s handling of Russia and President Vladimir Putin recently. The critics say that Obama has appeared weak in the face of Russia -- first, when it sent troops into the Ukrainian region of Crimea, and then when it quickly acted to annex the territory. For instance, on Fox News Sunday, Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., said the Obama administration ""is creating an air of permissiveness"" toward Russian expansionism. ""We do need to show long-term resolve."" Another Fox News Sunday guest, Republican strategist Karl Rove, took the opportunity to contrast Obama’s actions with those of Rove’s old boss, President George W. Bush. Rove suggested that Bush’s policies were more muscular and effective in countering Putin’s Russia. Specifically, in 2008, while Bush was serving his final year in office, he faced a foreign-policy crisis that in some ways echoed what’s been happening more recently in Crimea. The conflict involved Russia; Georgia, a former Soviet Republic that was by then independent; and two separatist regions within Georgia, South Ossetia and Abkhazia. After several years of restiveness by Russian-backed rebels in South Ossetia, the Georgian government made a military push that attempted to retake control of the region in August 2008. Russia responded militarily, successfully pushing back Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Clashes continued for a week, including in portions of Georgia beyond the two breakaway regions, until France helped broker a peace deal. Russia then recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations, though most other countries have not taken that step. So how did Bush respond as hostilities were erupting in Georgia? Here’s Rove’s recollection: ""I think the 2008 experience is instructive. ... What the United States did was it sent warships to the Black Sea, (and) it took the combat troops that Georgia had in Afghanistan and airlifted them back, sending a very strong message to Putin that you're going to be facing combat-trained, combat-experienced Georgian forces. And not only that, but the United States government is willing to give logistical support to get them there. And this stopped (Russian troops) at … the two enclaves, and they did not make a move at Tbilisi. We need similar strong movement now."" We’ll take a look at two of the moves Rove said Bush made -- sending ""warships to the Black Sea"" and airlifting ""the combat troops that Georgia had in Afghanistan"" back to Georgia. Sending warships to the Black Sea The United States -- and its military alliance, NATO -- did indeed have ships in the Black Sea near Georgia in August 2008, but the story behind their presence is more nuanced than an unmistakable show of force against Russian aggression. There was little question that the United States backed the Georgian position in the conflict. The United States had been a staunch supporter of Georgia and its military ever since Georgia became independent, and Bush, speaking from the Beijing Olympics, said, ''Georgia is a sovereign nation, and its territorial integrity must be respected. We have urged an immediate halt to the violence and a stand-down by all troops. We call for the end of the Russian bombings.'' However, the military actions taken by the United States to back up these words were more cautious. For instance, the administration sent the guided missile destroyer McFaul to the Georgian port of Batumi, but it was loaded with humanitarian aid, according to a report in the Aug. 28, 2008, New York Times:  In essence, the United States was walking a tightrope between showing military defiance and offering a more humanitarian face. The Times called this balance ""delicate."" ""At the time, these gestures were not viewed as particularly strong,"" said Lincoln Mitchell, who was chief of party for the National Democratic Institute in Georgia from 2002 to 2004 and is now affiliated with the Arnold A. Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. Georgian President Mikheil Saakashvili, Mitchell said, ""complained throughout the war that he was not getting support."" It’s also worth noting that a portion of the western military presence in the Black Sea was already in place before the conflict erupted. For instance, NATO said that four of its warships were in the Black Sea because of previously scheduled anti-terrorist and anti-piracy exercises. Airlifting Georgian combat troops from Afghanistan There was in fact an airlift of Georgian military personnel -- but it wasn’t from Afghanistan. It was from another country where the United States and its allies were fighting a war: Iraq. On Aug. 11, 2008, Agence France-Presse reported that the United States military had ""nearly completed"" the airlift of 2,000 Georgian troops from Iraq to Georgia. Here, too, the United States took pains to portray its actions as being limited rather than aggressive. Pentagon spokesman Bryan Whitman told reporters that the United States was ""fulfilling our agreement with the Georgian government that, in an emergency, we will assist them in redeploying their troops. We are honoring that commitment."" Whitman told reporters at the time that the 130 U.S. troops and military contractors who were already in the country to train Georgian troops had been brought together at an undisclosed location away from the hostilities. And Whitman made clear to reporters that -- contrary to allegations by Putin -- the U.S. was not flying the Iraq-based Georgian troops to the war zone. It’s not clear that Russia was all that worried about the troops airlifted from Iraq, regardless of Putin’s rhetoric, Mitchell said. ""The troops from Iraq were not exactly combat ready to fight against Russia, nor was Putin concerned about those troops,"" he said. David L. Phillips, director of Columbia University’s program on peace-building and rights, expressed skepticism about Rove’s suggestion that the United States’ response in 2008 was so strong that it essentially stopped Russian troops in their tracks. ""There was never any chance of the Bush administration going to war in Georgia, and everybody knew that,"" he said. ""It was for show. It would be misleading to suggest that our response was so robust that it deterred further aggression."" Our ruling Rove said that after Russia went to war with Georgia in 2008, the U.S. sent a ""very strong message"" to Putin by sending ""warships to the Black Sea"" and airlifting ""the combat troops that Georgia had in Afghanistan"" back to Georgia. In reality, the military message sent by the warship movements was deliberately fuzzed by having the vessels carry humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, the airlift of Georgian troops from Iraq -- not Afghanistan, as Rove had said -- was carefully calibrated not to deposit them where they could quickly face off against Russian forces. Contemporary accounts and experts agree that Rove was spinning what was actually a modest and nuanced military response into something more forceful. The truth is that Bush was geopolitically hamstrung -- just as Obama is now -- by facing a nuclear-armed, expansion-minded Russia willing to intervene militarily in countries on its own doorstep, but far from our own. We rate Rove’s claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973C6AC0>],/factchecks/2014/mar/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-george-w-bush-had-more-muscular-sta/

Are Oregon students skipping math class to learn about the Bible?
","Religious-freedom issues are on center stage these days. Some religious groups say health-care provisions requiring them to provide birth control for their employees violate their First Amendment rights. At least two bakeries, one of them in Gresham, have made headlines by contending they shouldn’t be forced to bake wedding cakes for same-sex couples because of their religious beliefs. The Claim A Chicago school teacher who moonlights as an Internet blogger picked up a similar theme after seeing a recent story in The Oregonian. Hemant Mehta, whose pen name is ""The Friendly Atheist,""  had this to say after reading that Banks School District students are released from classes in the middle of the day for religious instruction: ""In Oregon, students are skipping math class to learn about the Bible."" He added, ""There’s a law in Oregon -- it’s been around for decades -- that allows public school students to skip classes for up to two hours a week (or five if they’re in high school) in order to get ‘instruction in religion.’"" Students are skipping math for religious instruction? PolitiFact Oregon took a look. The Analysis We emailed Mehta, who saw mention of a religious instruction law in a story that ran in The Oregonian on March 10, 2014. Mehta said he didn’t doubt the law existed. His problem with it, he said, is missed instruction time. ""In my experience, most students who miss significant time do not perform as well as their classmates,"" he said. To find out more about the law itself, we emailed Portland attorney Warren Foote, local chapter president of the Christian Legal Society, a group of legal professionals who incorporate Christian principles into their practices. Foote, noting that his practice doesn’t focus on First Amendment or religious freedom issues, said he hadn’t heard of the law. His subsequent research showed that ORS 339.420 was enacted by the 1965 Oregon Legislature. The law, amended twice since, requires parents to apply to have a child excused from school ""for periods not exceeding two hours in any week for elementary pupils and five hours in any week for secondary pupils to attend weekday schools giving instruction in religion."" Foote said he could find no other legislative history on how it came into being. We called Judy Busch, executive director of PREP4Kids, a Portland-based nonprofit that coordinates release-time religious instruction for about 30 area schools, Banks among them. For legal specifics, she referred us to Herb Grey, a Beaverton attorney active in conservative causes such as Oregon Right to Life. Grey said he lacked detailed information on the origins of ORS 339.420 but suspects it was a reaction to the landmark 1963 U.S. Supreme Court case that banned Bible-reading in American public schools. ""Ever since then, courts have generally ruled that these release-time laws are legal,"" he said. ""They’ve said you can’t get school credit for them, but you can certainly have them."" Crystal Greene, the state Education Department's communications director, said no numbers are kept on total student involvement in these programs statewide. However, an Internet check shows that numerous Oregon school districts incorporate the law into their policies. We visited the Multnomah County Law Library and learned that ORS 339.420 was part of House Bill 1020, introduced and eventually passed in 1965. The records we examined turned up no detailed information, such as House Education Committee minutes for any hearings held on the bill. We did learn that a young Portland state senator, Vic Atiyeh, sat on the Senate Education Committee that eventually approved the bill. Then-Gov. Mark O. Hatfield signed it into law March 25, 1965. Having at least blown some of the dust off the law, we wondered about the other part of Mehta’s claim: Are students skipping math to get that instruction? We called Banks schools Superintendent Bob Huston, who has the final say in the amount of time students spend in religious study since it’s specified in the law. What he can’t control, he said, is exactly which part of the day the instruction takes place. Huston, working with district parents, has agreed to carve out the last hour of the day for students to receive off-site religious instruction. Asked whether students are missing math to do that, he replied, ""No math class is at the same time for every student."" In other words, a student whose math class is at the end of the school day would miss that class, while other students are missing other subjects. It’s important to note that parents must grant their permission for students to miss school for religious instruction. As part of that, we looked at Mehta’s use of the word ""skipping"" to see whether that implies students are truant. But none of the definitions we consulted directly equated ""skipping"" with an unexcused absence. The Ruling Hemant Mehta, a Chicago teacher and moonlight blogger, recently wrote that a decades-old Oregon law has resulted in public school students ""skipping math class to learn about the Bible."" An Oregon law passed in 1965 does let children out of school for weekly religious instruction. Under ORS 339.420, hundreds of students are receiving anywhere from two to five hours of religious instruction a week, depending on their age. We also found that at least some of the students who miss classes for religious study are missing math class, with their parents’ permission. We rate Mehta’s claim True.

Karl Rove says Crimea annexation removes Viktor Yanukovych's 2010 margin of victory
","We and our friends at PolitiFact are used to poring over American election results. Here, we’ll test our skills looking at election returns from Ukraine. We’re checking a claim by Karl Rove, a former top adviser to President George W. Bush, who appeared on the March 16, 2014, edition of Fox News Sunday. Rove was discussing the Russian takeover of Crimea, suggesting that Russian-leaning candidates would now face long odds in Ukrainian politics without the votes of supporters on the Crimean peninsula.  First, some background. Crimea which had long been a part of Russia until it was handed over in 1954 by Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in the early 1990s, Crimea, despite the presence of Russian military facilities and a majority-Russian populace, remained part of the newly independent Ukraine. But earlier this month, protesters in the Ukrainian capital of Kiev ousted pro-Russia president Viktor Yanukovych. After a pro-western transitional government took power, Russia sent troops into Crimea -- located on the country’s southeast flank -- and scheduled a referendum to determine whether Crimea should affiliate with Russia. In the March 16 referendum, which was criticized by the West as illegal, roughly 97 percent of Crimean voters sided with secession to Russia. Within two days, Russian president Vladimir Putin had formally accepted Crimea into Russia by signing an annexation treaty. While this treaty still needs to pass through a few more hoops to take effect, these are considered formalities. On Fox News Sunday, Rove operated under the assumption that annexation would go forward. Annexation, Rove said, ""removes a million residents of the Ukraine that have provided the margin of victory for Yanukovych, the pro-Moscow prime minister in his last election."" Such a change to the map would mean that the remainder of Ukraine, following the removal of one of its strongest pro-Russia bastions, would become more favorable electoral territory for pro-Ukrainian politicians. In the United States, it might be analogous to gains the Democratic Party could make if Texas were to secede from the union, or gains the GOP could make if California were to quit the United States. We wondered whether what Rove said was accurate, so we looked through Ukrainian election results from the 2010 presidential election. In that election, the second and final round of voting pitted Yanukovych against pro-Ukraine politician Yulia Tymoshenko. In the final balloting, Yanukovych defeated Tymoshenko 49 percent to 46 percent. In order for Rove to be correct, Yanukovych’s margin of victory over Tymoshenko in Crimea and Sevastopol -- the two regions that joined Russia -- would have to match or exceed his margin of victory in the nation as a whole. It turns out that Rove’s claim was close, but not perfect. In Crimea, Yanukovych beat Tymoshenko by a 639,529-vote margin, and in Sevastopol, he won by a 156,261-vote margin. Together, that equals a margin of 795,790. Nationally, though, Yanukovych beat Tymoshenko by a somewhat larger margin -- 887,909 votes. So Yanukovych’s margin in Crimea and Sevastopol didn’t account for all of his national margin of victory, but it came close -- about 90 percent of the vote. Dominique Arel, who chairs the Ukrainian studies department at the University of Ottawa, said that ""47 percent of the electorate lives in the southeast. With the removal of Crimea, it probably shrinks to 45 percent or a touch less, making it very difficult in a polarized election for a southeast candidate to win."" A final note: Other regions provided even more votes for Yanukovych than Crimea and Sevastopol did. Donetsk provided him with a margin of more than 2.2 million votes, while Luhansk gave him a margin of more than 1.1 million votes. Our ruling Rove said that Russian annexation of Crimea ""removes a million residents of the Ukraine that have provided the margin of victory for (Viktor) Yanukovych, the pro-Moscow prime minister in his last election."" Crimea and neighboring Sevastopol -- the two newly annexed portions of Russia -- were certainly bastions of support for Yanukovych in the 2010 election. But while they came close to providing his entire national margin of victory, they fell a bit short, providing 90 percent of Yanukovych’s winning margin. We rate Rove’s claim Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097899E00>],/factchecks/2014/mar/19/karl-rove/karl-rove-says-crimea-annexation-removes-viktor-ya/

Four U.S. citizens killed in Obama drone strikes, but 3 were not intended targets
","As LaRouche Democrat and U.S. Senate candidate Kesha Rogers of Texas calls for the impeachment of Democratic President Barack Obama, she lists among her reasons the ""assassination"" of U.S. citizens. Rogers says on her campaign website that Obama violated the Fifth Amendment ""with the avowed assassination of at least four American citizens, Anwar Al-Awlaki, his 16-year-old son, Samir Khan, and Jude Mohammed, without benefit of due process of law. Indeed, the death warrants against these individuals were effectively signed in secret, in a committee which is overseen directly by the president."" PolitiFact has dipped before into the debate around the Obama administration’s use of pilotless drones armed with missiles to target terrorism suspects, exploring whether the president can legally authorize the killing of a U.S. citizen fighting for a foreign terrorist group, whether the program could be used on U.S. soil, if it complies with international law and if Obama has kept Congress fully informed. Were the individuals named by Rogers all U.S. citizens ""assassinated"" at Obama’s direction? Rogers’ views and alignment with conspiracy theorist and former presidential candidate Lyndon LaRouche led the Texas Democratic Party to urge voters not to cast ballots for her in the March 4, 2014, primary. Rogers still won enough votes to trigger a May 27 runoff that will determine whether she or Dallas investor David Alameel, who led the field, will challenge the Republican nominee, second-term U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, in November. In support of Rogers’ assassination claim, her campaign manager, Ian Overton, emailed us news stories from The New York Times and the New Yorker magazine, and we found more news coverage using Google and the Nexis news database. The citizens On May 22, 2013, the Obama administration ""formally acknowledged for the first time that it had killed four American citizens in drone strikes outside the battlefields of Afghanistan and Iraq"" since 2009, The New York Times said in a news story posted online that day. The acknowledgement came in a letter signed by U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder sent that day to the Senate Judiciary Committee chairman: Since 2009, the United States, in the conduct of U.S. counterterrorism operations against al-Qa’ida and its associated forces outside of areas of active hostilities, has specifically targeted and killed one U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Aulaqi. The United States is further aware of three other U.S. citizens who have been killed in such U.S. counterterrorism operations over that same time period: Samir Khan, ‘Abd al-Rahman Anwar al-Aulaqi, and Jude Kenan Mohammed. These individuals were not specifically targeted by the United States. Anwar al-Awlaki and Khan were killed in Yemen on Sept. 30, 2011. A March 9, 2013, Times news story about the strike said al-Awlaki, a cleric born in New Mexico, incited and plotted terrorist incidents involving U.S. targets, including lending support via email to Nidal Hasan in 2009 before Hasan killed 13 and wounded more than 30 people at Fort Hood in Texas. Khan, who the story said came from North Carolina, edited the online al-Qaeda propaganda magazine Inspire. The Times wrote of al-Awlaki’s death, ""For what was apparently the first time since the Civil War, the United States government had carried out the deliberate killing of an American citizen as a wartime enemy and without a trial."" Al-Awlaki’s 16-year-old son, a U.S. citizen born in Denver, Colo., died Oct. 14, 2011, in Yemen when, the Times wrote, ""a missile apparently intended for an Egyptian Qaeda operative, Ibrahim al-Banna, hit a modest outdoor eating place in Shabwa. … Banna was not there, and among about a dozen men killed was the young Abdulrahman al-Awlaki, who had no connection to terrorism."" U.S. citizen Jude Kenan Mohammad was believed by his family to have been killed in a November 2011 strike in Pakistan, according to a May 24, 2013, Los Angeles Times news story that said, ""Former U.S. officials said that even if Mohammad wasn't the target of the strike, he was of interest to American intelligence because he was believed to have communicated with Muslims in the United States and encouraged them to travel to Pakistan or carry out attacks at home."" The New York Times said another U.S. citizen, Kamal Derwish, had been killed by a drone strike in Yemen on Nov. 3, 2002, when George W. Bush was president. Derwish was a recruiter who put together an al-Qaeda sleeper cell in Lackawanna, N.Y., according to an Oct. 12, 2003, New York Times news story. The U.S. said he was not the intended target and did not acknowledge killing him, but a Yemeni official identified him as one of six men who died in the attack, the story said. Another U.S. citizen could be facing death by drone, according to news reports. A Feb. 28, 2014, New York Times news story said Abdullah al-Shami, ""a militant who American officials say is living in the barren mountains of northwestern Pakistan"" and who was possibly born in Texas, ""is at the center of a debate inside the government over whether President Obama should once again take the extraordinary step of authorizing the killing of an American citizen overseas."" Obama’s role Of the 2011 deaths, Rogers spokesman Overton said, ""The Obama White House claims that only Anwar al-Awlaki was specifically targeted. However, there is no way to verify that, since the deliberations are secret. Either they were targeted or they were collateral damage of a kill policy. In either case, the program is run by Obama, who personally makes the final decision to kill a target. If the three were not specifically targeted, their deaths remain the responsibility of Obama."" We looked to Obama’s public comments as well as news reports, including those Overton sent, for details. In a May 23, 2013, speech at the National Defense University, Obama said he had authorized the attack on Anwar al-Awlaki: ""I would have detained and prosecuted Awlaki if we captured him before he carried out a plot, but we couldn’t. And as president, I would have been derelict in my duty had I not authorized the strike that took him out."" What about the strikes that Holder said killed U.S. citizens unintentionally? News accounts indicate Obama likely approved those attacks as well. The New York Times reported in a May 29, 2012, news story that cited current and former presidential advisers, ""Obama has placed himself at the helm of a top-secret ‘nominations’ process to designate terrorists for kill or capture."" The story, which quoted sources including William M. Daley, chief of staff in 2011, and Thomas E. Donilon, White House national security adviser from late 2010 to mid-2013, said that ""the nominations go to the White House, where by his own insistence and guided by (then-White House counterterrorism adviser John) Brennan, Mr. Obama must approve any name. He signs off on every strike in Yemen and Somalia and also on the more complex and risky strikes in Pakistan — about a third of the total."" Brennan, who became director of the CIA in 2013, said in an April 30, 2012, speech at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars that proposals for a lethal strike are ""evaluated by the very most senior officials in our government for a decision."" CNN’s Jessica Yellin asked Obama in a Sept. 5, 2012, interview if he decides who will be targeted in drone attacks. The president said, ""As president, ultimately I’m responsible for decisions that are made by the administration,"" and said an ""extensive process"" is behind such decisions. He described criteria: the target must be ""authorized by our laws""; there must be a serious, not speculative, threat; there must be no option to capture the targeted individual instead of using deadly force; and civilian casualties must be avoided. Yellin pressed: ""Do you personally approve the targets?"" Obama said, ""I can’t get too deeply into how these things work,"" but again said, ""Ultimately I’m responsible for the process that we set up."" An Oct. 23, 2012, news story in the Washington Post said, ""Obama approves the criteria for lists and signs off on drone strikes outside Pakistan, where decisions on when to fire are made by the director of the CIA."" ‘Assassination’ Were the cited deaths assassinations? Dictionaries define assassination as killing a person, particularly a prominent political figure. Left open is the question of whether the person’s death was intentional or collateral. A 1976 presidential executive order banned government employees from involvement in political assassinations; the word ""political"" was dropped from later orders, ""assassination"" is not defined and the federal government has argued the restriction doesn’t apply to wartime or terrorists. A Nov. 4, 2002, CNN news story on the ban notes that in 1986, President Ronald Reagan ordered the bombing of the home of leader Moammar Gadhafi of Libya and in 1998, President Bill Clinton ordered missile strikes on suspected terrorist compounds in Afghanistan. After the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Bush signed an ""intelligence finding"" that enabled the CIA to pursue and kill terrorists around the world. Anthony Clark Arend, a Georgetown University expert on international law, told us by phone that the 1976 order was meant to prohibit attacks on political opponents such as Cuba’s Fidel Castro, ""where those individuals were not combatants in an armed conflict against the United States."" Holder has said the drone strikes are not assassinations because they are not illegal. In a March 5, 2012 speech at the Northwestern University School of Law, Holder said, ""Some have called such operations ‘assassinations.’ They are not, and the use of that loaded term is misplaced. Assassinations are unlawful killings. … the U.S. government’s use of lethal force in self defense against a leader of al Qaeda or an associated force who presents an imminent threat of violent attack would not be unlawful — and therefore would not violate the executive order banning assassination or criminal statutes."" Arend said that wasn’t how he’d state it, but agreed the deaths were not assassinations. That term, he said, applies to political opponents rather than foes at war with the U.S. In his view, Arend said, the use of military force authorized by the president ""against a combatant in an ongoing armed conflict -- which I would argue and one could argue actions against terrorists are -- that wouldn’t constitute an assassination,"" whether the combatant was American or not. Our ruling Rogers said Obama was responsible for ""the assassination of at least four American citizens"" in drone strikes. U.S. drone strikes reportedly carried out on Obama’s authority killed the citizens listed by Rogers. But three deaths were evidently not intended, while it’s debated -- and unsettled at best -- whether the killing of al-Awlaki, targeted for his al-Qaeda role, was an assassination. We rate this claim, which presents these deaths out of context, as Half True. HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.

Georgia sentencing reforms pays off on budget, Deal says
","The Great Recession forced many elected officials to rethink their approach to governing in some areas. In Georgia, it has resulted in a philosophical change that has saved the state millions of dollars, Gov. Nathan Deal recently told one group. Deal said the changes in criminal sentencing adopted in 2012 have helped Georgia’s bottom line by about $20 million. A PolitiFact Georgia reader saw an article that outlined the claim and asked us to check it out. We wanted to know whether the governor’s numbers were on target. Or should he be sentenced for faulty math? The governor made the comments at a reception of graduates of the University of Georgia School of Public Affairs in Atlanta. Deal told the group he was surprised by the speed and size of the savings, Morris News Service reported. ""I was amazed at the dollar figures ... and amazed at the time frame,"" said Deal, a Republican. Deal spokesman Brian Robinson said that in 2011 the state paid counties more than $23 million to house state inmates in county jails, some of which were overcrowded. ""In 2013, the payments were slightly under $3.2 million — approximately $20 million less!"" Robinson wrote in one email. In 2012, Deal, a former prosecutor, said Georgia needed more cost-effective criminal justice approaches that didn't compromise public safety. State lawmakers crafted legislation to establish alternatives to incarceration for low-level, nonviolent drug and property offenders. At the time, 60 percent of Georgia’s inmates were locked up for drug and property crimes, according to a state study. Many elected officials across the country have employed a similar approach to balance their budgets in the post-recession world. In Georgia, the changes included reduced sentences for relatively minor crimes such as writing bad checks and burglary, and the state is diverting addicts to community supervision and treatment through so-called accountability courts instead of sending them through the normal criminal system and on to prison. State officials projected the package would save taxpayers $264 million in prison spending over the next five years. The big change has been the state is spending less money on housing inmates in county jails because of a lack of space in Georgia prisons. Those inmates assigned to the county lockups typically work on roadway or construction projects for that county. Georgia spends $20-$22 per day for each inmate in a county jail, records show. Deal’s proposed budget offers statistics that support his claim. In Fiscal Year 2012 -- which began July 1, 2011, and ended June 30, 2012 -- the state’s subsidy to various counties to house its inmates was slightly more than $25 million. In Deal’s proposed budget, Georgia’s Department of Corrections projected it would pay about $4.6 million to counties. Deal recommended about $1.6 million. Georgia’s Department of Corrections sent us several spreadsheets that also backed up the governor’s claim. In 2011, Deal’s first year in office, Georgia spent about $26.5 million to house state inmates in county jails. In 2013, the state paid counties nearly $3.8 million. That’s a $22.7 million difference. Statistics show there are fewer Georgia prisoners in state and county lockups. In March 2011, the average daily population in county jails awaiting a trip to state prison was nearly 5,000, Corrections Department figures show. Last week, there were just 611 inmates waiting to be transferred, the Corrections Department spreadsheets show. The average number of inmates sitting in state prison decreased by about 1,000 a day between 2011 and 2013. Another state report showed the year-round number of inmates had declined in the past two years from 40,648 to 35,111. To sum up, Deal said Georgia has saved $20 million through changes in sentencing. State data show there has been a $20 million decrease in the amount of money spent housing state inmates in county jails. We rate the governor's statement True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097540180>],/factchecks/2014/mar/19/nathan-deal/georgia-sentencing-reforms-pays-budget-deal-says/
