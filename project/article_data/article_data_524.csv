No, Beto O'Rourke did not dismiss veterans and the elderly
","As rumblings of former U.S. Rep. Beto O’Rourke running for president gain traction, so do some questionable claims about the maybe-candidate’s platform. ""If I could throw two kinds of people in the garbage it would be the elderly and wounded veterans,"" reads the text under a photo of O’Rourke that was published on Facebook on Feb. 13. ""When a tool breaks you don’t fix it, you throw it in the damn trash."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Is it true? ""Of course not,"" O’Rourke spokesman Chris Evans told PolitiFact. ""Beto has never said that, and it’s a fabricated quote."" He pointed to O’Rourke’s position as a member of the House Veteran Affairs Committee and his work as ""the congressional representative for the large military community of El Paso,"" where the congressman is from. ""His leading bipartisan initiative to expand access to mental health care for veterans was passed in the House, passed in the Senate, and signed into law by the president,"" Evans continued. ""He held regular veteran town halls in El Paso to hear directly from those who wore our country’s uniform and ensure they had access to their representative in Congress."" Trump vs. O'Rourke on immigration messaging in El Paso After searching online, we couldn’t find any sources to corroborate the claim that O’Rourke said vets and seniors should trashed. According to ProPublica’s list of the legislation O’Rourke sponsored during 2017-2018, he backed six bills related to veterans, including the Get Veterans a Better Doctor Now Act and the Enhanced Veteran Healthcare Act of 2017. During O’Rourke’s failed bid to oust Ted Cruz from the U.S. Senate, the Texas Tribune asked both lawmakers what three legislative accomplishments they were most proud of. ""The O’Rourke campaign passed along three measures that the El Paso Democrat saw signed into law by Trump,"" the Tribune reported, including two bills related to veterans and service members. ""O’Rourke was the primary sponsor of the Honor our Commitment Act, which expanded mental health care through the VA to veterans with ‘other-than-honorable’ discharges from the military. The measure was included in an omnibus spending bill in March."" The Tribune notes a blog post O’Rourke wrote earlier on March 2017 describing veteran suicides.

Yes, Democrats held majority almost every time Congress approved a minimum wage increase
","Eighty-one years ago, the American workforce was introduced to its first ever federal minimum wage. President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1938 signed the Fair Labor Standards Act, which established an hourly minimum wage rate at 25 cents for covered workers. Today, the FLSA also sets standards for government and youth employees as well as overtime pay. Now, a meme circulating the internet attempts to examine how Congress acts on minimum wage standards depending on which party is in power. ""Since 1938, the minimum wage has been raised 23 times,"" the post, in full, reads. ""It was raised 21 times during Democratic congresses, and only twice during Republican ones. Still think both parties are the same?"" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found the figures to be relatively solid. The minimum wage has indeed gone up 23 times since 1938, when you count the year a minimum wage was established as a ""raise"" in itself. Some studies and reports put the number at 22, leaving the 1938 rate out of its tally, however. According to the Congressional Research Service, the public policy arm of Congress, the minimum wage has been raised 22 separate times, through 10 separate amendments to the FLSA. Some amendments to raise the minimum wage contained one-time increases (e.g., 1949 amendments), while others contained multi-year increases (e.g., 1977 amendments). The minimum wage hasn’t been raised since the current federal rate of $7.25 took effect in 2009, which was the last of a series of increases previously signed into law by President George W. Bush. (The federal minimum wage prevails in the 21 states that don’t mandate a higher one.) Regardless if Congress voted for multi-year or single-year increases, it is correct that all but two raises came about when the Democrats held the majority, whether it was when the increases were approved or enacted. Harry Holzer, professor of public policy at Georgetown University and a former chief economist at the Department of Labor, told us by email that the timeline sounds right. ""The Democrats controlled the House of Representatives for much time since 1938 and uninterrupted between 1955 and 1994; and they controlled the Senate for much of those time periods (but not 1981-86),"" he wrote. ""There were many minimum wage increases between 1955 and 1980, all passed by Democratic congresses. Since 1980, there have only been 3 increases voted on by Congress: 1991, 1996 and 2007. Only the middle of these came out of a Republican congress."" While various Republican presidents signed increases into law over the years, all did so while Democrats held the majority. The two times the rate was raised during a Republican majority were in 1996 and 1997, approval of which came after months of pressure from Democrats. The final vote was 74 to 24, with 27 Republicans joining all 47 Democrats in favor. President Bill Clinton signed that bill into law, which accounted for two raises over the two years, totaling at $5.15. It is also important to clarify that it isn’t as if 22 distinct votes were held to raise the minimum wage, and that all those came during Democratic majorities and subsequently brought about increases. There were only about half as many votes – since some amendments covered multiple years of raises. Nevertheless, it is accurate that – besides the 1996 bill – the votes that did take place and the raises that were approved came about when Democrats held the majority. There’s a reasonable explanation as to why: Many Republicans have long been wary of raising the federal rate. Opponents of doing so argue that such mandated wage increases could lead employers to cut positions, reduce hours or increase prices in order to stave off the reduced profits that may come from paying a higher wage. Proponents, meanwhile, argue that by increasing earnings for lower income workers, employers reduce employee turnover and create more demand by giving workers more purchasing power. That said, we feel compelled to note that eight of the times American workers saw an increase in the federal minimum wage, those increases were brought about by four separate amendments that were signed into law by Republican presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush. Because some of these raises were implemented over the course of numerous years, eight Republican presidents were in office during years when the minimum raise hikes took effect. A social media meme claims that since 1938, the federal minimum wage has been increased ""23 times"" and was raised ""21 times during Democratic congresses, and only twice during Republican ones."" Including the introductory federal minimum wage in 1938, the rate has indeed been raised 23 times and 21 of those increases came during a Democratic majority in Congress. But sometimes the bills for increases came as a multi-year package, while others were just single-year raises. That said, four Republican presidents signed the laws that made these raises possible and eight Republican presidents were in leadership at the time these increases took effect. The statement that Democrats controlled Congress 21 of 23 times the minimum wage was increased  is accurate but needs clarification or additional information.

Warren: U.S. rubber-stamped deal; Bayer-Monsanto now controls 25% market share
","Democratic presidential candidate Elizabeth Warren has put regulating the power of large firms at the center of her campaign. She often speaks about the big banks, but recently, she trained her sights on agribusiness. ""By rubber-stamping the Bayer-Monsanto merger, the Justice Department is handing control over one quarter of the world's seeds and pesticides market to one ginormous agribusiness,"" the Massachusetts senator posted on Facebook Feb. 4. ""That’s bad for farmers, bad for our food supply, and bad for consumers everywhere."" In this factcheck, we look at whether U.S. antitrust regulators gave the merger little thought, and whether the deal produced a company as large as Warren said. The $60-plus billion merger of German-based Bayer with the American firm Monsanto essentially won U.S. antitrust approval in May 2018. That came about 18 months after the two multinational firms struck a deal. After long negotiations, the Justice Department secured what it called the largest merger divestiture ever before letting Bayer’s purchase of Monsanto go through. The value of the sell-off was over $7 billion. Bayer had to unload its cotton, canola, soybean and vegetable seed businesses, as well as its Liberty herbicide line, all of which overlapped with what Monsanto was doing. It's also worth noting that European regulators approved the deal months before the Justice Department acted. Critics of the Justice Department's decision, such as the National Farmers Union, described it as rubber-stamping. The government's process was more deliberate than that term implies.  Industry analyst Jonas Oxgaard with the investment research firm Sanford Bernstein told us Bayer is now ""pretty close to one fourth of the world’s market."" There’s been a spate of mergers and acquisitions over the past two decades, and today, just four firms dominate the seeds and agrichemical business. Oxgaard said Bayer has about $12 billion in crop protection sales out of a world market of $56 billion, or about 21 percent of sales. And for seeds, Bayer has $10 billion out of a total $40 billion market, or about 25 percent. There are different ways to slice the data. Other analysts put Bayer at 33 percent of global seed sales and 22.9 percent of agrichemical sales. Either way, Warren’s number is a reasonable shorthand. But we found opinions mixed on what Bayer’s hefty market share means. For certain crops, the seed business now is in the hands of just two firms. ""In the two by far most valuable crops for the seed producers, corn and soybean, Bayer and DowDupont together have around 75 to 80 percent market share, a classic duopoly,"" Oxgaard told us. ""That said, that still hasn’t led to massive price increases over the last several years. The end result of the duopoly seems rather that they don’t compete particularly vigorously to capture market share from each other."" For rice and wheat, Oxgaard said, both Bayer and DowDupont are ""bit players."" But Philip Howard, associate professor in the Department of Community Sustainability at Michigan State University, said the small number of firms ""creates an environment conducive to price signaling and may result in higher prices."" In a study of growing industry concentration, the U.S. Agriculture Department reported in 2012 that ""for the past two decades, the prices of farm inputs have been rising faster than the prices U.S. farmers receive for their crops and livestock."" This likely limited the impact of market dominance, Howard said. He told us that in recent years, falling commodity prices have put a brake on rising prices for seed and agricultural chemicals, because farmers can’t afford to keep paying more. The story for chemicals can play out a bit differently than for seeds. Oxgaard noted that protecting crops from insects and diseases is a moving target. Dupont, for example, had a lock on a chemical that killed a moth that hit Brazil a few years ago. It made high profits, until the threat largely disappeared. ""A company might control the only means of protection against one specific threat, but that is temporary,"" Oxgaard said. Warren said the Justice Department ""rubber stamped"" a deal that cleared the way for one firm to control one-fourth of the seeds and pesticide market worldwide. The regulatory process took many months and Bayer had to sell substantial business lines to win approval. ""Rubber-stamped"" gives the wrong impression that it happened without scrutiny or conditions. The market share number is generally correct. However, Bayer plays a commanding role in the sale of some seeds, such as corn and soybeans, and not in others. And the experts we reached described the limits of control, even when one or two firms dominate a market. We rate this claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8F7EC0>],/factchecks/2019/feb/14/elizabeth-warren/warren-bayer-monsanto-controls-25-seed-pesticide-m/

Would Medicaid expansion bring 40,000 jobs to North Carolina, as state House Democrat says?
","Democrats in North Carolina’s General Assembly filed bills to expand Medicaid last month, and now the party’s leaders are taking their case to the public. One big selling point: jobs. ""Expanding Medicaid would bring 40,000 jobs to North Carolina,"" said House Minority Leader Darren Jackson, who represents part of Wake County, in a Jan. 30 tweet. PolitiFact North Carolina has checked claims about the added coverage Medicaid expansion would give to North Carolinians, but Jackson’s statement is the first we’ve considered that tries to link expansion to more jobs in the state. So we decided to see how it stacks up to the facts. (PolitiFact examined similar statements from politicians in Florida and Wisconsin in 2013.) North Carolina has participated in Medicaid, a program that provides health insurance to low-income people, since 1970. Since 2010, 36 states and the District of Columbia have used a provision in the federal Affordable Care Act to pay for expanded Medicaid coverage for people with household incomes below 138 percent of the federal poverty line, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, an independent health care research group. North Carolina has not expanded Medicaid, and the Republican-led state legislature passed a bill in 2013 that effectively prohibits expansion without the legislature's approval. But Democrats say there are economic reasons to expand the program. The costs of Medicaid are split between the state and the federal government, with the federal government currently paying 67 percent. But the federal government has pledged to pick up the bulk of the expansion costs, including 95 percent now and 90 percent after 2020. We talked to four experts about the economic impact, and they agreed that there would be a large gain in jobs. They said the reason is simple: An influx of new Medicaid money would lead to more spending across the state’s economy. Jackson said the $40,000 estimate came from a 2014 report by the Cone Health Foundation, a Greensboro-based 501(c)(3) organization that supports Cone Health, a nonprofit network of health-care providers in the area. The Cone report said that if North Carolina did not accept expansion by 2016, the state would lose an estimated $21 billion in federal money between 2016 and 2020, resulting in 43,000 fewer jobs statewide. Leighton Ku, director of George Washington University’s Center for Health Policy Research and the lead author of the Cone report, said that he has not updated his analysis since 2014. But he said conditions are about the same now and the amount of federal money Medicaid expansion would bring ""ought to be roughly comparable to our earlier estimates."" ""The evidence continues to indicate that Medicaid expansion would increase the flow of federal funding into North Carolina, which would improve economic growth and increase the number of jobs,"" Ku said. ""States that expanded Medicaid found that their economies were stronger; the lack of expansion in North Carolina has held the state back."" Other experts agreed. David Anderson, research associate at Duke University’s Margolis Center for Health Policy, said Medicaid expansion would ""turn on a new flow of federal funds into the state without changing the current outflow of funds."" In other words, there would be lots more money coming in, but not going out. Michael Walden, professor of economics at North Carolina State University, said that money would turn into spending and jobs both in and outside the medical industry. According to the Cone report, only about half of the jobs would be in the medical industry, with the rest distributed among industries such as construction, retail, real estate and food and beverage. Using an economic development model specific to North Carolina and assuming that Medicaid expansion would bring in $13 billion over the next decade, Walden estimated that the expansion would create about 39,000 jobs — a number similar to the Cone Health finding from 2014. Still, as PolitiFact Florida noted years ago, it can be difficult to determine to what extent new jobs are the direct result of one program or another. There are lots of moving parts, and expansion could inspire new Medicaid enrollees who are eligible but have not yet signed up to seek their own benefits, adding more costs to the state that could in turn affect job growth. It’s also worth noting that the Cone Health Foundation calls itself a ""supporting organization"" of Cone Health, which presumably would receive additional money from Medicaid expansion. So we should take its findings with a slight grain of salt, even though Anderson said the report used a ""well-established methodology and tools."" Jackson said, ""Expanding Medicaid would bring 40,000 jobs to North Carolina."" Indeed, economists and health care experts say more money injected into North Carolina would lead to more jobs for its residents, although it’s difficult to pinpoint exactly how much. Jackson’s estimate fits in line with the available research, and experts we spoke to agreed it was reasonable. But it’s still an estimate — a fact Jackson did not mention in his tweet. We rate this statement Mostly True. This story was produced by the North Carolina Fact-Checking Project, a partnership of McClatchy Carolinas, the Duke University Reporters’ Lab and PolitiFact.

Checking Kamala Harris on tax refunds and the GOP tax law
","  Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, a U.S. senator from California, recently tweeted criticism of the Republican-backed tax law. The impact of the law, which was signed by President Donald Trump in December 2017, is beginning to become clearer as Americans begin filing their returns. The law is in effect for the first time for the 2018 tax year, so people will be seeing the impact now. On Feb. 11, Harris tweeted, ""The average tax refund is down about $170 compared to last year. Let’s call the President’s tax cut what it is: a middle-class tax hike to line the pockets of already wealthy corporations and the 1%."" The average tax refund is down about $170 compared to last year. Let’s call the President’s tax cut what it is: a middle-class tax hike to line the pockets of already wealthy corporations and the 1%. The accuracy of her tweet, we found, is something of a mixed bag. Harris said, ""The average tax refund is down about $170 compared to last year."" Recent statistics from the Internal Revenue Service suggest that refunds are down, although it’s worth looking at the $170 figure somewhat cautiously. The IRS reported that of the 16 million tax filings made through Feb. 1, the average refund fell from $2,035 in the 2017 tax year to $1,865 in the 2018 tax year. That’s a decline of $170, as Harris said; that works out to an 8 percent decrease in refund size from the previous year. However, it’s important to note that this is based on a small sampling of tax returns. In 2017, the IRS processed more than 154 million returns, making the pre-Feb. 1 batch less than 5 percent of the total expected for this year. The government shutdown in January also slowed down the processing of early returns, so this is even a smaller sample than in a typical, non-shutdown year. Moreover, the early returns may not be representative of the ultimate patterns for refunds. ""We just don’t know yet"" what the pattern will be said Mark Mazur, director of the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. ""I caution against running with the 8 percent drop"" as what the typical refund will look like once all returns are in. Harris said, ""Let’s call the President’s tax cut what it is: a middle-class tax hike to line the pockets of already wealthy corporations and the 1%."" There’s something to this assertion, but the tweet leaves out some important caveats. Democrats have consistently painted the tax bill as heavily tilted toward the rich. For instance, the Democratic National Committee said the GOP ""passed a tax bill that gave 80 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent."" The DNC pointed to an analysis of the final version of the tax bill by the Tax Policy Center. The analysis found that by 2027, the tax bill would deliver 82.8 percent of its benefits to the top 1 percent of the income spectrum. However, in earlier years, the distribution of benefits would look very different. For instance, in 2018, the bill would deliver 20.5 percent of the benefits to the top 1 percent — vastly less than the 83 percent figure the DNC touted. And as late as 2025, the center projected, 25.3 percent of the benefits would flow to the top 1 percent. The main reason: By 2027, a number of key tax provisions that benefit middle-income taxpayers will have expired unless Congress extends them. Meanwhile, the Tax Policy Center also projected that the middle class would be more likely to benefit than not. The middle 60 percent of the income distribution would be much more likely to get a cut than an increase in 2018, with roughly 90 percent of those households getting a tax cut that year, compared to well under 10 percent who would see an increase. (By 2027, many more taxpayers in that group would see increases than decreases.) By placing the two assertions together, Harris implies that smaller refunds are evidence that the changes in the law aren't helping middle-income taxpayers. But in reality, there's no direct connection between refunds and tax burdens. Even beyond the concerns about how reliable the early refund statistics are, there’s an important difference between refunds and tax burdens. Refunds materialize when a taxpayer has too much tax withheld from their biweekly paycheck. When that happens, the IRS sends the taxpayer a check for the overage after processing their return. It’s entirely possible to get a smaller refund even as your tax burden falls -- you would have gotten a modest amount more per week, eating into your end-of-year refund. It’s also possible to get a bigger refund as your tax burden climbs. It all depends on how much was withheld in taxes on a biweekly basis. Harris’ campaign said that ""the tweet makes a couple assertions with a limited number of characters."" No -- it's totally understandable to be spooked by a smaller-than-normal refund, and it's an experience that tax wonks and ordinary people view very differently. To tax experts, any taxpayer’s goal should be to get as close as possible to zero refunded and zero owed. Anything different, in this view, amounts to a no-interest loan from the taxpayer to the government. ""People, if you want to know whether the (tax law) was good for you or not, stop obsessing about the size of your refund and pay attention to your total income tax bill,"" the Tax Policy Center senior fellow Howard Gleckman implored in a recent blog post. But this runs counter to how many Americans budget for the year. ""For those that rely upon refunds, the ‘you’re giving the government an interest-free loan’ argument is correct, but it’s not any solace for people who use that as a savings method,"" said John Buhl, a spokesman for the Tax Foundation. Small weekly changes made over a long stretch of time tend to make less of an impression than one big annual payment, especially if you’re used to relying on it to make ends meet. The Harris campaign noted that Gallup polling released in October 2018 found that about two-thirds of respondents said they haven't noticed an increase in their take-home pay since passage of the tax law. ""If I ask 100 people, ‘What was your tax liability last year?’ about 99 percent won’t know, and the other one will be a tax expert,"" said Mazur of the Tax Policy Center. ""But everyone knows what their refund amount was. It might be their biggest financial transaction all year."" Vanessa S. Williamson, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has studied this question, agreed. ""Obviously, legislators should not encourage additional confusion between a taxpayer’s refund and his or her net tax contribution,"" she said. Still, she added, the downside risk of owing taxes at the end of the year is big enough to justify higher withholding during the year, especially for those who don’t have large reserves of savings. ""It makes sense for these Americans to want to be absolutely confident that they will see some extra money come in during tax season, and to be absolutely sure they will not have to scramble to cover an unexpected bill from the IRS,"" Williamson said. Harris said, ""The average tax refund is down about $170 compared to last year. Let’s call the President’s tax cut what it is: a middle-class tax hike to line the pockets of already wealthy corporations and the 1%."" Average tax refunds are down by $170 so far this year, though that’s a preliminary number that may or may not hold up. And the wealthy do gain disproportionately from the tax changes passed in 2017, but this glosses over the projections saying that most households will see tax cuts for the first eight years or so. However, stating these two assertions in quick succession suggests that the smaller tax refunds are evidence of the tax bill’s negative impact on middle-income taxpayers, and that’s not the case. It’s entirely possible to get back a smaller refund even as you’re paying less in total taxes for the year, as a big majority of taxpayers are in 2018. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBA8A800>],/factchecks/2019/feb/13/kamala-harris/checking-kamala-harris-tax-refunds-and-gop-tax-law/

Matt Gaetz said Democrats' platform once said illegal immigrants were committing felonies
","In an emotional congressional hearing on gun violence, U.S. Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., sparked controversy when he brought up deaths by immigrants in the country illegally, drawing shouts from fathers whose children were shot to death in Parkland. Gaetz said Feb. 6 that a proposed gun background check bill would not have stopped violent crimes committed by undocumented immigrants. However, he said that a ""wall, a barrier on the southern border may have."" The next day, CNN host Chris Cuomo asked Gaetz why he brought up immigrant-linked deaths during the gun violence hearing in an interview the next night. Gaetz offered a fiery rebuttal, misleadingly saying that the ""new left"" wants to be ""borderless with no ICE."" ( In 2018, congressional Democratic leaders called for a restructuring of Immigration and Customs Enforcement — which handles removals from inside the country — but not an end to immigration enforcement. A few Democrats seem to want the agency shuttered, but many others talk of changing or limiting the agency.) At one point, Gaetz argued that the Democrats used to call for cracking down on illegal immigration, too. ""In 1992, the Democratic Party had in their platform provisions that said that illegal aliens were coming in this country, committing felonies, sent back and then they were right back across the border to do the same thing,"" said Gaetz, of Fort Walton Beach. Gaetz’s claim about the party’s platform was new to our ears, so we decided to fact-check it. We found that Gaetz had a point, but was off by one presidential cycle. The 1996 Democratic Party platform was unusually tough in raising alarm about illegal immigrants committing crimes, being deported and returning to the United States. The political parties write platforms in presidential election years to outline their positions on major political issues. They offer a collective vision to which the candidates are somewhat bound. ""Convention delegates, interest groups, party activists, and party officials fight very intensely over planks in the platform because they believe those words are important and define just what the party stands for,"" said University of Denver political science professor Seth Masket. ""They're not just to tell candidates what to run on; they're to tell party members just what kind of candidates they want to nominate in the first place. The 1992 party platform said very little about immigration. The brief mention shows the Democrats using welcoming terms: ""Our nation of immigrants has been invigorated repeatedly as new people, ideas and ways of life have become part of the American tapestry. Democrats support immigration policies that promote fairness, non-discrimination and family reunification, and that reflect our constitutional freedoms of speech, association and travel."" Gaetz’s spokeswoman told us that he was referring to the 1996 party platform, which indeed offered a sharp turn. That platform took a hard-line stance against illegal immigration and praised efforts on border security by President Bill Clinton, who was running for his second term. Part of the platform read: ""Today's Democratic Party also believes we must remain a nation of laws. We cannot tolerate illegal immigration and we must stop it. For years before Bill Clinton became president, Washington talked tough but failed to act. In 1992, our borders might as well not have existed. The border was under-patrolled, and what patrols there were, were under-equipped. Drugs flowed freely. Illegal immigration was rampant. Criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in America, returned the very next day to commit crimes again. … Just since January of 1995, we have arrested more than 1,700 criminal aliens and prosecuted them on federal felony charges because they returned to America after having been deported."" That language is similar to what Gaetz cited: the Democrats talked about immigrants in the country illegally committing crimes, being sent back to their home countries, and then returning to the United States. Gaetz didn’t mention this, but the platform also contained a pro-immigration message. It said, for example, ""we deplore those who blame immigrants for economic and social problems"" and ""deplore those who use the need to stop illegal immigration as a pretext for discrimination."" At the time, the Republican Party platform was more aggressive. It asserted that undocumented immigrants increase crime, that children of illegal immigrants should be blocked from gaining citizenship, and English should be the official U.S. language. It had a brief nod about the United States as a nation of immigrants: ""We welcome those who follow our laws and come to our land to seek a better life. New Americans strengthen our economy, enrich our culture, and defend the nation in war and in peace."" The Democratic platform in 1996 was influenced by the changing immigration politics of the early to mid 1990s. The number of unauthorized immigrants was rapidly rising, from 4.2 million in 1992 to 5.6 million in 1996 (a 33 percent increase). Public opinion polls indicated that two-thirds of Americans believed that immigration levels should be decreased. Major constituencies of the Democratic Party, including unions and environmentalists, also advocated for reductions in immigration, said Rey Koslowski, a University at Albany political science professor. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform chaired by Democrat Barbara Jordan recommended increasing Border Patrol officers, restricting the ability of undocumented immigrants to get public services and reducing legal immigration. The more conservative approach was part of Clinton’s broader effort to move the Democratic Party to the center. The ""New Democrat"" agenda included his 1996 overhaul of welfare (half of which was initially paid for by cutting all benefits to permanent resident aliens) as well as revisions to immigration law. The Democratic Party, having spent a long time being battered as being soft on crime, made a strategic decision to embrace the illegal immigration control pieces of the legislation, said William Stock, former president of the American Immigration Lawyers Association. Clinton signed the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act into law on Sept. 30, 1996 — just in time for the November presidential election. The 1996 law called for deporting immigrants who were once legally in the United States but now subject to deportation because of a criminal conviction. These efforts in 1996 helped Clinton attract a large swath of voters, including industrial workers in the midwest (so-called Reagan Democrats), independents, environmentalists and Southern Democratic voters. ""And it worked,"" Koslowski said. Before the election, the Republicans thought they would parlay their 1994 midterm sweep into a presidential victory, choosing San Diego, Calif., as the site of their national convention. Two years before, California voters passed a measure that prohibited illegal immigrants from using health care, public education and other services. (Courts later deemed Proposition 187 unconstitutional.) Clinton won re-election and received 72 percent of the Latino vote. Over time, the Democratic Party’s platform shifted to helping undocumented immigrants as immigration became more of a civil rights issue. The 2016 platform made a passing nod to border security, calling for a pathway to citizenship and stating that enforcement should focus on safety threats. ""President Trump and his aggressive immigration enforcement, unlike that seen in any modern president, has further polarized the issue and led many Democrats to resist the enforcement initiatives,"" said Kevin Johnson, dean of the University of California Davis, School of Law. Gaetz said, ""In 1992 the Democratic Party had in their platform provisions that said that illegal aliens were coming in this country, committing felonies, sent back and then they were right back across the border to do the same thing."" He got the year wrong; he was was actually referring to the 1996 platform. That document touted Clinton’s efforts on stopping illegal immigration. Using similar words as what Gaetz described, it said that in 1992, ""Drugs flowed freely. Illegal immigration was rampant. Criminal immigrants, deported after committing crimes in America, returned the very next day to commit crimes again."" Gaetz accurately captured the party’s sentiment in the mid 1990s. More recent platforms have favored a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. We rate this statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC37B00>],/factchecks/2019/feb/13/matt-gaetz/matt-gaetz-said-democrats-platform-once-said-illeg/

Bobby Scott is right about falling value of minimum wage
","U.S. Rep. Bobby Scott, D-3rd, recently touted his bill to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 a hour before the House Education and Labor Committee. ""Today’s minimum wage worker making $7.25 an hour has less buying power than a minimum wage worker in the 1960s,"" he said during a Feb. 7 hearing. We wondered if Scott was correct, so we looked at the data. In 1960, the federal minimum wage was $1 an hour. That’s equivalent to $8.57 an hour in today’s dollars. (We used the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ inflation calculator for calculations). In 1961, the minimum wage was raised to $1.15 and sat there the following year. In today’s dollars, it was worth $9.63 in 1961 and 9.57 in 1962. In 1963, the wage rose $1.25 and stayed there for the next three years. In today’s dollars, it was worth $10.23 in 1963, $10.13 in 1964, $9.94 in 1965, and $9.69 in 1966. In 1967, the wage increased to $1.40. In today’s dollars, it was worth $10.56. In 1968, the wage rose to $1.60 and stayed there for six years. In today’s dollars, it was worth $11.58 - an all-time high - and $10.98 in 1969. When adjusted for inflation, the average federal minimum wage during the 1960s was $10.09 and hour - $2.84 higher than today’s wage. That’s a 28 percent decrease in value. Over a 40-hour work week, that translates to $113.60 in lost gross pay. Scott’s bill would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 an hour in 2024, and afterwards index it to inflation. Scott and other supporters of the measure say it would put more money in pockets of an estimated 40 million workers, many of them women and minorities. They predict that the increased spending power will lift the economy. Opponents of the bill, including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, say the $15 an hour wage would harm small businesses, especially those located in the areas with low costs of living. It should be noted that were at least three bills introduced in the General Assembly this winter to raise Virginia’s minimum wage, which is set at the federal floor of $7.25 an hour.  All of the measures were killed in committees. Thirty states have raised their minimum wages above the federal floor. Our ruling Scott said, ""Today’s minimum wage worker making $7.25 an hour has less buying power than a minimum wage worker in the 1960s."" When adjusted for inflation into today’s dollars, the minimum wage of that decade varied from $8.57 an hour to $11.58. The average over the decade was $10.09 and hour - significantly higher than today’s rate. We rate Scott’s statement True. Correction: Bobby Scott is a Democrat. An earlier version of this fact-check misidentified his party.   ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC742E80>],/factchecks/2019/feb/13/bobby-scott/bobby-scott-right-about-falling-value-minimum-wage/

Donald Trump swipe at Beto O'Rourke's crowd size is wrong
","President Donald Trump loves to trumpet the sizes of the crowds at his rallies (and his inauguration, incorrectly). He also likes to belittle those of his political rivals. On Feb. 11, Trump went to the border city of El Paso, Texas, to tout his get-tough policies on immigration. On the same night, Beto O’Rourke, a possible 2020 Democratic presidential candidate who previously represented El Paso in the U.S. House, spoke to a crowd elsewhere in El Paso. During his speech, Trump mocked the turnout of O’Rourke’s event. Trump described O’Rourke as ""a young man who's got very little going for himself, except he's got a great first name."" Trump added, ""He challenged us. So we had, let's say 35,000 people tonight and he has 200 people, 300 people. Not too good."" Was it true that just ""200 people, 300 people"" attended O’Rourke’s speech? We may never know the exact number of attendees -- we sought an official estimate from the El Paso Police Department and the city government of El Paso, but none was provided by publication time. Media reports suggested the number was in the thousands. For instance, the Texas Tribune reporters in El Paso wrote that ""about 7,000 people went to see O'Rourke speak at the park, according to an aide, who cited law enforcement."" (The White House did not respond to a request for information.) Still, after reviewing photographic and video footage of the event, we conclude that the number was definitely higher than the 200 to 300 Trump said. Consider video footage distributed by O’Rourke on Twitter. Here’s a freeze-frame showing the middle of the crowd from the perspective of the podium:  Panning to the left, we see that the crowd continues (we’ve cropped it to avoid duplication):  And if you pan further left, there’s still more (also cropped to avoid duplication):  Meanwhile, a livestream video published by the El Paso Times has a different, and more narrow, perspective -- facing the stage. But even this view suggests a crowd of more than just 200 or 300 people.  As for the question of whether 35,000 people attended Trump’s rally, news reports suggest that law enforcement officials disagree with his estimate. An El Paso Fire Department spokesman told the El Paso Times that the venue where Trump was speaking holds 6,500 people for that type of event, and it was filled to capacity. A few thousand more might have been standing outside, fire public information officer Enrique D. Aguilar told the newspaper, though there was no official count made of the outside crowd. This would mean that the total crowd size ""might be 10,000 with the people outside,"" Aguilar told the paper. Other reported estimates were a few thousand higher. Either way, those estimates were well below Trump’s total. (We will update this article if an official government estimate is released.) Trump said that at O’Rourke’s rally in El Paso, there were ""200 people, 300 people."" Our review of the available visual evidence suggests that the number is clearly several times that. Media reports suggest the number may have been much larger still, in the thousands.

GOP leaders cite misleading Foxconn jobs number
","Amid reports questioning Foxconn Technology Group's future in Wisconsin, Republican leaders issued a statement praising the Taiwanese technology titan for the impact its project has already had in the state. The company has said it will build a $10 billion facility in Mount Pleasant to manufacture LCD panels and eventually employ 13,000. Those figures have appeared in doubt at times, including in January 2019 when news reports said the company was backing off or delaying its plans. Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, R-Rochester, and Senate Majority Leader Scott Fitzgerald, R-Juneau, released a joint statement on the company’s status Jan. 30, 2019. They covered a lot of territory, including some we’ve already fact-checked. They blamed new Gov. Tony Evers, a Democrat, for Foxconn’s waffling — which we rated Pants on Fire. They said ""not a dollar"" in state funds would go to Foxconn until jobs were created — which we rated Mostly True. And they addressed the impact Foxconn has already had in Wisconsin: ""In a short time, Foxconn has made a positive impact across Wisconsin with more than 1,000 new jobs, an investment of $200 million, three innovation centers and one of the largest gifts ever of $100 million to the UW-Madison,"" Vos and Fitzgerald said. The jobs claim caught our eye. Has Foxconn already been responsible for a four-figure bump in Wisconsin employment? When asked for backup to the claim, Vos spokeswoman Kit Beyer pointed us to a Jan. 17, 2019 letter Foxconn sent to state officials detailing the employment impact to date. The letter said Foxconn ""created 1,032 direct jobs and many more indirect jobs in support of the Wisconsin project. This figure includes 178 full-time Foxconn employees and 854 employees involved in the construction of (the Foxconn campus), who are residents of 54 counties in Wisconsin."" RELATED: See our Foxconn factchecks (A quick aside: Those 178 Foxconn jobs were 82 short of the minimum required for the company to immediately claim the first year’s job-creation tax credits from the state. Foxconn could still make up those jobs later and get the funds, which are among the first of a promised $4 billion in public subsidies.) So Foxconn is connected to more than 1,000 jobs, but reaching that number requires combining the company’s hiring with the temporary construction work generated by the building process. And there aren’t 1,000 current jobs. Foxconn said the 854 construction jobs tally is a cumulative one that counts every Wisconsin worker who has been involved in the project since it began. It’s the most recent jobs report assembled by Gilbane Building Co., the project’s general contractor, and includes work done through the end of November 2018. There were also several dozen construction workers from outside Wisconsin. Most of those construction jobs no longer exist, though, since the phase of construction those workers were involved in has ended. John Mielke, president of the Associated Builders and Contractors of Wisconsin, said a project the size of Foxconn likely has several hundred workers on site at a time. Both Mielke and Pat O’Brien, executive director of the regional development group Milwaukee 7, said 854 construction jobs sounds reasonable for a project the size of Foxconn. Vos and Fitzgerald said in a statement that Foxconn has already ""made a positive impact across Wisconsin with more than 1,000 new jobs."" That implies 1,000 people are now employed because of Foxconn, but that’s not the case. Nearly all of those jobs are temporary, construction-related positions. Experts say it’s more likely several hundred construction workers were on the job at any given point thus far. The discrepancy is particularly noteworthy since the number of Foxconn jobs is a key aspect of the political debate, and hiring at Foxconn itself fell short of the 260 jobs needed to qualify for a first round of state tax credits. That makes it a statement with an element of truth that ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E9BFDA80>],/factchecks/2019/feb/12/wisconsin-republican-legislative-leaders/wisconsin-gop-leaders-cite-misleading-foxconn-jobs/

Omar garbles details of McDonald's CEO and typical worker pay
","A liveable wage is high on the Democratic agenda, and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., focused on a fast-food icon to drive home her message. Omar highlighted the pay difference at McDonald’s. Her tweet said: ""In 2017, the CEO of McDonalds got paid $21.8 million. The median pay for a McDonald's worker that year was $7,000. This is a moral outrage. We need a $15 minimum wage so that no one is paid a poverty wage. #RaiseTheWage"" In 2017, the CEO of McDonalds got paid $21.8 million.The median pay for a McDonald's worker that year was $7,000.This is a moral outrage. We need a $15 minimum wage so that no one is paid a poverty wage. pic.twitter.com/TIxZMlzQF6 #RaiseTheWage The tweet features a video of Omar at a Feb. 7 congressional hearing in which she said, ""The median pay for a McDonald’s worker was $7,000 in 2017. That is the pay gap between the CEO that’s making $21.8 (million) to the $7,000 that a worker who has put in 40 hours a day gets paid."" If you’ve heard of Omar before, it’s because she was in the news recently apologizing for comments about campaign contributions and Israel, after her fellow Democrats said the comments were anti-Semitic. Most of Omar’s public comments since her 2018 election have focused on families and wages. Omar’s staff told us the McDonald’s numbers come from the company itself. (She meant to say 40 hours ""a week"" and not ""a day"" during her remarks.) As part of the Dodd-Frank regulatory reforms, publicly traded companies have to report how much compensation the CEO got and how much the median worker got. In McDonald’s SEC filing, it said CEO Steve Easterbrook made $21.8 million in 2017. The amount was largely driven by stock price and other company performance incentives. The company also said its median worker made $7,017, as Omar said. But there are two important qualifications: That was for all McDonald’s workers across the globe. And it included ""all full-time, part-time, seasonal and temporary workers."" The company’s filing gave the example of a part-time restaurant crew worker in Poland who made the median amount. Omar’s statement was about raising the U.S. hourly wage to $15. McDonald’s worldwide median pay doesn’t say anything about pay in the United States, with its very different labor market and all the things that affect those markets, such as health insurance, labor laws and more. If $7,000 a year isn’t the right number for a median American McDonald’s worker, what is? McDonald’s couldn’t provide the answer, although the press office told us that the average pay of hourly workers is over $10 an hour, for corporate-owned establishments. That represents about one out of nine McDonald’s, because most are franchise-owned. The economics firm Indeed posts McDonald’s pay on its website. The average crew member, like the one in Poland, makes $9.21 an hour in the United States. The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics says the median pay for a someone doing that work in the fast-food industry is $9.70 an hour. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average hours worked per week at a limited-service restaurant is 24.2 hours. Scale that up to a full year and, using the slightly higher rate from the BLS, the typical crew worker makes about $12,200. We invited McDonald’s to respond to our calculation and the press office said the company had no further information to share. The Economic Policy Institute, a labor-oriented think tank, compares the pay of CEOs to typical workers. The institute estimated that in the United States, the typical CEO makes 312 times more than the average worker. Based on our analysis, the ratio at McDonald’s is about 1,786 to one. Omar said that while the McDonald’s CEO made $21.8 million, the median worker made $7,000.  Those numbers reflect the company’s official filing, but Omar failed to note that the worker pay was a worldwide estimate and that it included part-time workers. Based on available information, we estimated that the typical McDonald’s crew member works part-time and makes about $12,000 a year. That’s about two-thirds more than Omar said.  The disparity between the CEO and the typical worker remains vast. But the specifics Omar offered leave the wrong impression about the real numbers for U.S. workers who would be affected by a minimum wage hike. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4E9BFD280>],/factchecks/2019/feb/12/ilhan-omar/omar-trips-details-mcdonalds-ceo-and-typical-worke/

Would White House hopeful Pete Buttigieg have more military experience than any recent president?
","With as many as 25 potential candidates eyeing a run for president in 2020, one of the least known is Pete Buttigieg, the millennial mayor of South Bend, Ind., population 102,245. On CBS’ This Morning, co-host Norah O’Donnell asked the 37-year-old what qualifies him to be president. Buttigieg (pronounced BOOT-edge-edge) noted his government experience, then added: ""I have more military experience than anybody who’s arrived behind that desk since George H.W. Bush."" As many readers already know, this comes down to a comparison between Buttigieg and the elder Bush’s son, George W. Bush. As Buttigieg indicated, the late George H.W. Bush had an extensive military background. He was a lieutenant (junior grade) bomber pilot in the U.S. Navy during World War II, serving from 1942 to 1945. He flew a total of 58 combat missions, was shot down in the Pacific and was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. Since the elder Bush served in the White House, three of the successors to the Oval Office — Republican Donald Trump and Democrats Barack Obama and Bill Clinton  — did not serve in the military. That leaves the elder Bush’s son, George W. Bush, also a Republican, who was president from 2001 to 2009. The younger Bush was a first lieutenant in the Texas Air National Guard from 1968 to 1973, during the Vietnam War. He was certified as a fighter pilot, but only served stateside, seeing no combat. So, is Buttigieg’s military experience more extensive than George W. Bush’s? Yes. The gay and married Rhodes scholar served longer in the reserves and saw active duty. Buttigieg’s official mayoral biography says he served eight years, from 2009 to 2017, in the U.S. Navy Reserve. A spokeswoman for his exploratory committee cited to us a first-person reflection that Buttigieg wrote for his hometown newspaper, the South Bend Tribune, about his wartime service. The article was about his taking a leave of absence as mayor, in 2014 during his first term, when he was called up to active duty to serve for six months as a counterterrorism intelligence officer in Afghanistan. The article included a photograph of Buttigieg in Kabul, wearing fatigues and a rifle strapped over his back. The war in Afghanistan is now in its 18th year, as the New York Times noted in a summary. In 2014, the Pentagon declared an end to American combat operations. Since then, a smaller number of troops have remained to train Afghan forces and carry out counterterrorism operations against groups like the Islamic State. Buttigieg’s military service has also been noted in a number of news articles, including the Washington Post, Military.com and the New York Times (which said his leave was unpaid). Buttigieg said: ""I have more military experience than anybody who’s arrived behind that desk since George H.W. Bush."" Among the four men who have been president since the elder Bush, only George W. Bush served in the military: five years stateside with the Texas Air National Guard. Buttigieg served eight years in the U.S. Navy Reserve, including a six-month war-time deployment in Afghanistan, in 2014. We rate Buttigieg’s statement True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBE4140>],/factchecks/2019/feb/12/pete-buttigieg/would-white-house-hopeful-pete-buttigieg-have-more/

The story says Trump signed the Save Our Seas Act of 2018 and ""extended and expanded the program to clean up man-made waste by boosting international cooperation on removing debris from the planet’s oceans."" It cites another story published on the website of a Fox News affiliate in El Paso.

There are millions of tons of debris in the world’s oceans; an estimated eight million metric tons of plastic find their way there each year, according to Ocean Conservancy. Is it accurate, we asked, to summarize the legislation as a bill ""to clean millions of tons of garbage from the world’s oceans."" ""Not exactly,"" said Jordana Merran, communications manager for the group. Rather, the law Trump signed reauthorizes ""the longstanding amount of $10 million annually"" for NOAA’s Marine Debris Program, she said. ""The program does support, among other efforts, Ocean Conservancy’s International Coastal Cleanup, in which volunteers collect millions of pounds of garbage off beaches and waterways annually across the globe. However, many entities provide financial support for the ICC."" According to a transcript of Trump’s remarks as he signed the bill on Oct. 11, he said more than 8 million tons of garbage is dumped into oceans every year. The Save Our Seas Act ""will help address this problem,"" he said. ""We also are strengthening that up to improve waste management overseas and clean up our nation’s waters."" The legislation, which was sponsored by U.S. Sen. Dan Sullivan, R-Alaska, and cosponsored by Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, had bipartisan support. It doesn’t direct the country to clean millions of tons of garbage from marine environments. Rather, the bill reauthorizes and amends the Marine Debris Act ""to promote international action to reduce marine debris, and for other purposes,"" according to the law. But it’s not specific about how much debris, or how it should be cleaned up. For example, in cases of a ""severe marine debris event""—when natural disasters like tsunamis or storms cause unusually large amounts of marine debris—the United States would ""assist in the cleanup and response required by the severe marine debris event,"" the bill says. It also notes the president should ""support research and development on systems and materials that reduce"" the amount of solid waste in the marine environment, as well as work with other countries that discharge waste into the water to develop ""mechanisms to reduce such discharges."" And there are other suggestions in the law, such as studying of the economic impacts of marine debris. The Marine Debris Program, meanwhile, was established in 2006 to ""identify, determine sources of, assess, prevent, reduce, and remove marine debris and address the adverse impacts of marine debris on the economy in the United States."" But it also doesn’t specify how many tons of debris the country will clean, in the words of the Facebook post.

Wasserman Schultz says expanding drilling would have virtually no effect on gas prices
","
On Dec. 1, 2010, Secretary of Interior Ken Salazar announced that the Obama administration would not allow oil and gas drilling through 2017 in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico.

That decision reversed one by the administration weeks before the April 20, 2010, Deepwater Horizon explosion.

December's announcement prompted cheers from U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Democrat who represents Congressional District 20 in South Florida.

In a Dec. 1 press release, Wasserman Schultz wrote:

""A 5 percent increase in domestic production would increase the world supply by less than 1 percent and do almost nothing to our dependence on foreign oil. This would also have virtually no effect on the price of gas at the pump, which is something every consumer really cares about. Adding a fraction of a percent to the global oil supply will not lower gas prices and ignores the critical need to develop alternative energy supplies that finally break our addiction to fossil fuels.""

The Truth-O-Meter has examined several claims about oil drilling and gas prices. But we wanted to know for this Truth-O-Meter, is Wasserman Schultz right? 
Would a 5 percent increase in domestic production increase the world supply by less than 1 percent, and why did she choose that 5 percent number anyway? Was she correct that such production would do almost nothing to our dependence on foreign oil and have virtually no effect on price at the pump?

We pulled background about oil drilling and gas prices from a June 2008 Truth-O-Meter ruling on U.S. Sen. and then-presidential candidate John McCain, who used the high price of gas as part of his argument to expand drilling. PolitiFact ruled False on his claim: ""We must deal with the here and now and assure affordable fuel for America by increasing domestic production.""

Background on drilling and gas prices

PolitiFact wrote:

The political momentum for offshore drilling has always risen and fallen along with gas prices. But while there are strong arguments that can be made in favor of offshore drilling, reducing the cost of gas ""here and now"" isn't one of them, according to oil experts and economists -- many of whom support the plan.

For starters, the lead time for oil exploration takes years. Even if offshore drilling areas opened up tomorrow, experts say it would take at least 10 years to realize any significant production. And even then, they say, the U.S. contribution to the overall global oil market would not be enough to make a significant dent in the price of gas.

""Drilling offshore to lower oil prices is like walking an extra 20 feet per day to lose weight,"" said David Sandalow, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and author of Freedom from Oil. ""It's just not going to make much difference.""

It takes years to bring new oil wells online, said Mike Rodgers, a leading oil expert with PFC Energy in Washington. Companies need to drill exploratory wells, then discovery wells around the exploratory wells that show promise. Shipyards that build platforms, a two- to three-year job, are already booked solid. 
""It's foolish to sell it as a short-term solution to high gas prices,"" Rodgers said. ""Opening off-shore drilling would have no impact whatsoever on gas prices today.""

Warning! Math starts here

Now back to Wasserman Schultz's claim. We asked her spokesman Jonathan Beeton for background information and he sent an e-mail with links to the documents Wasserman Schultz used. We're warning you now: This documentation includes lots of math.

For starters, Beeton pointed us to a map from the U.S. Department of Interior attached to a March 31, 2010, press release which shows that drilling in the Eastern Gulf could increase production by .274 millions of barrels a day. The chart also states that in 2007, U.S. domestic production was about 5.07 million barrels of oil a day. That translates to about 5.4 percent increase -- that's why Wasserman Schultz uses a 5 percent increase.

Beeton then turned to the Energy Information Administration, which provides statistics and analysis to the U.S. Department of Energy and Congress. The EIA showed that the U.S. consumes 19.5 million barrels per day as of 2008. EIA also states that global consumption of oil is about 85.46 million barrels a day (look for the world total on the bottom of the same chart for 2008.)

Then Beeton did some math:

Divide the amount that drilling in the Eastern Gulf could increase daily production -- .274 millions of barrels -- by global consumption of oil -- 85.46 million barrels a day -- and you get .32 percent increase to the world supply. That is less than 1 percent.

With current U.S. production of 5.07 millions of barrels a day, and U.S. consumption of 19.5 millions of barrels a day, then we produce 26 percent of what we consume, Beeton wrote. Increasing production to 5.344 (5.07 + 0.274) millions of barrels a day, would increase that number to 27.4 percent -- or a decrease reliance on foreign oil by 1.4 percentage points.

The experts weigh in

We ran Wasserman Schultz's claim by Jamie Webster, a senior consultant with PFC Energy, which tracks oil production and demand globally and whose clients are governments, including the United States., and oil and gas companies. We also heard from Daniel J. Weiss, who has written extensively about oil prices and policy and is a senior fellow and director of climate strategy at the Center for American Progress, which describes itself as a progressive think tank. Both Webster and Weiss agreed with Wasserman Schultz.

A 5 percent increase would produce around 200,000 to 300,000 barrels of oil a day while the world produced about 85 million barrels a day this year, Webster said.

""An increase like that would be one-third of a percent,"" Webster said. ""It could feasibly back up some potential imports but it would be almost a rounding error.""

As for prices at the pump, ""it wouldn't budge the market at all. We would still need to import gasoline; it would not have any impact. You wouldn't notice it at all.""

Weiss pointed to a chart from the Energy Information Administration, which shows projections of gas and oil costs in 2020 and 2030.

""Her point that it's going to make no difference in supply, no real difference in price, is correct,"" Weiss said.

Let's review: Wasserman Schultz's math adds up -- Gulf drilling does indeed represent about 5 percent of current domestic production, and a 5 percent increase would barely register in terms of the world supply. And the experts we found for this Truth-O-Meter as well as ones cited in the past about McCain's claim agree that expanding drilling now would have little effect at the pump any time soon. We rate this claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBBEF6C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/13/debbie-wasserman-schultz/wasserman-schultz-says-expanding-drilling-would-ha/
"['Federal Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Herb Kohl']","
U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl says he’s always been focused on reducing the federal deficit
","
Four-term U.S. Sen. Herb Kohl, D-Wis., isn’t often in the news, but a couple developments on a Friday afternoon in December put him there -- and may provide an early glimpse at the what to expect in the 2012 election.

Kohl, 75, has not hinted he will retire. But Republicans, after knocking off U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold in December, already have an eye on his seat.

So on Dec. 3, 2010, when President Barack Obama’s debt commission agreed on recommendations for long-term budget fixes and employment figures did not improve as much as expected, dueling news releases landed in reporters’ mailboxes.

Release one: The political arm of Senate Republicans blamed Kohl and Democrats for backing a ""bloated stimulus"" that failed to create jobs to bring the unemployment rate down.

Release two: Kohl issued a statement praising the debt commission’s work as a step toward getting America’s fiscal house in order.

""I have always been focused on reining in the deficit, and this is a good place to start for next year’s budget debate,"" Kohl said in the release.

""Always,"" of course, is a pretty high standard, especially over a 22-year career.

And during that time the multi-millionaire Kohl has been more known for his personal frugality than as a devoted deficit hawk. So we dug into that statement.

It would be impossible, of course, to examine every vote in that period. But we can look at key votes and examine how Kohl’s fiscal record compares to others in the Senate.

Kohl’s spokeswoman, Lynn Becker, said Kohl has approached the federal budget with a businessman’s eye for the bottom line. She cited numerous votes.

Her list includes Kohl voting in 2003 against expanding Medicare to give drug benefits to 40 million seniors and disabled people at a cost of $400 billion over 10 years.

Additionally, Kohl backed two balanced budget acts during the Bill Clinton years -- measures linked to bringing the federal budget into rare surplus; supported a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution; and voted against the second round of Bush tax cuts in 2003, citing concerns about deficits.

He went along with $500 billion in cost curbs on Medicare that were part of health care reform, and has voted against major military spending such as the F-22 aircraft, the C-17 cargo plane and B-2 bomber, Becker said. And he voted to eliminate the superconducting super collider and space station projects.

She notes Kohl was twice named to the deficit-reduction honor roll by the bipartisan Concord Coalition, a nonprofit group advocating for debt control.

A detailed defense, to be sure. PolitiFact Wisconsin confirmed those votes and honors.

But what about the other side of the ledger?

Among the big-ticket items Kohl voted for: 

Kohl also went along with supplemental appropriations to support the Iraq war, saying that cutting off funding would have endangered troops. He backed elimination of tax cuts for millionaires as an alternative way to pay for war costs.

Additionally, Kohl has opposed a ban on earmarks -- a small part of the budget but controversial because individual members of Congress use them to direct spending to their districts.

So the picture is not nearly as clear as the votes provided by Kohl’s office.

When it comes to budget-related rankings by the media and interest groups, some portray Kohl as fairly liberal on spending, while others put him in a different light.

The National Journal, a Washington D.C. publication, pulls out selected fiscal votes to judge senators on economic policy. It rated Kohl as the 19th to 34th most liberal in the 100-member Senate from 2007-2009. On a broader range of votes, the widely quoted rankings counted Feingold -- but not Kohl -- as a centrist.

The National Taxpayers Union Foundationa analyzes each lawmaker’s agenda based on bill sponsorship (not just those that had votes) and tallies its net cost -- or savings. Over his career, Kohl has averaged a ranking of 25th-stingiest in the Senate. The NTU advocates for lower taxes and smaller government.

We’ll sample a few other interest groups that take a broader view than simply budget issues: 
Overall, Kohl generally comes out as a somewhat moderate Democrat.

He certainly doesn’t have a reputation as a party-bucking maverick like Feingold, though he can point to some exceptions, such as supporting the balanced-budget amendment and line-item veto authority for the president.

Is he a Johnny-come-lately to the deficit issue or a closet deficit hawk?

He’s something in between, based on the ideologically mixed reviews he gets from interest groups and or examination of his voting record.

Let’s return to the original statement: ""I have always been focused on reining in the deficit.""

In making it, Kohl -- who owns the Milwaukee Bucks -- went to the basket hard. The statement certainly suggests Kohl has been at the forefront of the issue, though there is little evidence of that -- even on the deficit-minded votes his office cites. And he has voted for numerous big-ticket items, whatever the rationale for the individual votes.

Kohl’s fiscal rating of votes in recent years puts him in the most-liberal third of the Senate. That alone may not make him a big spender -- being a Republican conservative hasn’t necessarily meant deficit reduction in recent years -- but it’s a general clue that his agenda has often been focused more on spending than on cost controls. Thus, the slam dunk attempt falls short.

We rate Kohl’s statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4ECBBA1C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/13/herb-kohl/us-sen-herb-kohl-says-hes-always-been-focused-redu/
"['Education', 'Health Care', 'Texas', 'Donna Garner']","
Conservative education activist Donna Garner says Texas House Speaker Joe Straus coauthored a bill that would have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public school sex education
","
Blasting House Speaker Joe Straus, R-San Antonio, as a ""Republican in name only,"" the conservative Texas Eagle Forum says ""he has much more in common with the Democrats."" In a Nov. 9 newsletter, the group urges Texans to tell their state representative to vote for one of the other Republicans running for speaker. 
Legislators will choose the speaker for 2011-12 after the biennial legislative session convenes in January. 
In a section challenging Straus' conservative bonafides, the newsletter says he ""was co-author of a bill that would have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public school sex education."" 
Really? 
Some background: Planned Parenthood is a reproductive health care provider with facilities nationwide that offer family-planning services, including abortion. The organization advocates for comprehensive sexual health care and education. 
When we sought backup for the statement, Pat Carlson, president of the Texas Eagle forum, noted that the claim originated with Donna Garner of Hewitt, a retired teacher and a conservative education activist. 
Next, Garner told us via e-mail she was referring to House Bill 1842, a 2007 measure titled the ""Prevention First Act,"" which cleared a committee but died before the full House could take it up. Straus was one of its 14 co-authors. 
In an e-mail, Garner guided us to a May 2007 analysis of the legislation by the House Research Organization, a nonpartisan arm of the Texas House. According to the analysis, the legislation directed the state to promote family-planning services for low-income women and required school districts that provide sex education — including instruction on contraceptives — to explain the difference in effectiveness between correct and incorrect use of contraceptives. 
Garner stressed a section in the bill analysis outlining opponents' arguments against the bill. Among them: the proposed changes in how schools teach students about contraceptives would thwart efforts to promote abstinence and require detailed discussions about how to put on a condom. 
The legislation also described ""abstinence-only instruction"" to mean instruction that doesn't ""include information about preventing pregnancy, sexually-transmitted diseases,"" HIV and AIDS through any means other than abstinence. Opponents argued that the definition should reflect the definition that appears in Title V of the Social Security Act. The federal law describes abstinence-only instruction as teaching that abstinence is the expected standard for all school-age children and teaches that sexual activity outside of marriage is likely to have harmful psychological and physical effects, among other points, according to the bill analysis. 
Again in an e-mail, Garner told us that ""Straus' bill was meant to force teachers to emphasize condom/contraceptive use to students which would have, in turn, de-emphasized Title V guidelines that emphasize abstinence-only sex education.... changes in his bill would have resulted in a shift in the way sex education has been taught under Title V in the public schools in Texas."" 
But we found no language in the act potentially putting Planned Parenthood in charge of sex education in Texas. The legislation did not change current law that requires each school district's board and local advisory council of parents and community representatives to review course materials dealing with sexuality, and to comply with a list of restrictions as to how the courses can be taught, with emphasis on abstinence. 
Garner told us: ""If Straus had been a true conservative, he would not have supported H.B. 1842. His deep roots (and those of his wife) with Planned Parenthood undoubtedly led to his being a co-author of this bill. It is no surprise that Planned Parenthood in its fall 2009 Horizon newsletter publicly highlighted Joe Straus' support of its agenda."" 
Straus' wife was on the board of directors of the Planned Parenthood Trust of San Antonio and South Central Texas in the early 1990s, according to a January 2009 Austin American-Statesman news article. 
Finally, we consulted folks across the ideological spectrum about whether the proposed legislation would have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public-school sex education. 
In the ""no"" camp: Rochelle Tafolla, a spokeswoman at Planned Parenthood of Houston and Southeast Texas told us ""the statement is not at all accurate."" She did say Planned Parenthood, which has pushed ""for broader access to medically-accurate, comprehensive sex education and affordable family planning services,"" supported the legislation. 
One of the bill's five authors, Rep. Mark Strama, D-Austin, told us that Planned Parenthood was supportive of the legislation and was among the groups the authors consulted in drafting it. But he said that the legislation would not have allowed Planned Parenthood to control public school sex education. 
Tracy Young, a spokeswoman for Straus, also called Garner's statement ""inaccurate,"" and told us that the bill would have required HHSC to conduct an education outreach campaign to promote the reduction of unintended pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases. 
Kyleen Wright, president of the pro-life group Texans for Life who was listed as a witness against the bill, told us that ""it's obviously a stretch to say it gives Planned Parenthood control of sex education."" She said the legislation left the proposed outreach-campaign funding in the hands of the state. ""It certainly didn't hand (Planned Parenthood) sex education in the state,"" she said. 
We got a different take from Jonathan Saenz, director of legislative affairs at the right-leaning Liberty Institute. He told us he thought Garner's claim was valid. ""If Planned Parenthood (working through an elected official) has control and/or influence over changes to our statewide law governing how sex education is taught, changes that result in a version of sex education and related women's services that Planned Parenthood desires, approves of, and lobbies for, then they effectively have control of public sex education,"" he said in a statement. 
Our finding: In 2007, Straus co-authored a measure intended to promote family planning and to ensure that school districts that teach sex education spell out the effectiveness of contraceptives when used properly and not. Planned Parenthood supported the proposal and worked on the bill with Strama's office, but even if it had passed, it would not have changed the state-mandated, pro-abstinence focus on sex education in Texas schools. 
Garner can argue that legislation would have changed the education code to align more with Planned Parenthood's values than her own, but to say that it would have put the organization at the helm of sex education in public schools is an over-the-top claim. 
We rate her statement as Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC6AE3C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/13/donna-garner/conservative-education-activist-donna-garner-says-/

Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee labels Rep.-elect Jim Renacci a hypocrite over PAC contributions
","
Winning his bid for Congress has put Wadsworth Republican Jim Renacci in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee’s crosshairs for the foreseeable future.

On Dec. 7, the campaign arm of House of Representatives Democrats sent a ""Republican Hypocrisy Alert"" to reporters titled ""Representative-elect Jim Renacci Tells Washington Special Interests He is ‘Open for Business.’""

The news release cited news reports that listed Renacci among a group of newly elected Republican legislators who held post-election fundraisers in Washington, D.C., to pay off the debt from their campaigns.

""Representative-elect Jim Renacci claimed to run against the Washington establishment, but less than a month after being elected Renacci is hypocritically embracing it with big money, special interest fundraisers,"" DCCC spokesperson Ryan Rudominer said in the release.

On Dec. 8, Renacci spokesman James Slepian confirmed Renacci held a Dec. 7 lunch fundraiser to help retire his campaign debts. He said it was attended by about a dozen people, including political action committee representatives. Slepian called it ""disingenuous"" for the DCCC to attack Renacci for holding a fundraiser with PACs in light of the fact that the DCCC-backed incumbent that Renacci beat, Rep. John Boccieri, got most of his election money from PACs. During his term in Congress, Boccieri held numerous PAC fundraisers in Washington, according to a Sunlight Foundation database of fundraising invitations.

""We are just raising some money the way every other elected official is trying to do,"" Slepian said. ""There wasn’t an ‘open for business’ sign anywhere.""

Is Renacci being hypocritical for raising PAC money after his election?

During his campaign for Congress, Renacci often criticized his Democratic rival for relying on political action committee money. It’s a standard charge that challengers throw at incumbents. An Oct. 15 news release from Renacci said that ""John Boccieri has consistently relied on Washington special interests and union bosses to finance his campaign — with a majority of his contributions coming from political action committees.""

A review of Boccieri’s latest Federal Election Commission report shows the incumbent got about $1,047,000 from political action committees and $983,000 from individuals, which means he got roughly 52 percent of his money from PACs. A Center for Responsive Politics analysis of Boccieri’s PAC donations shows about a third of them came from organized labor, a third came from businesses and a third from ""ideological or single issue"" groups.

But even as Renacci complained about Boccieri’s political action committee money, he took it himself. Federal Election Committee records show that Renacci’s campaign got about $317,000 from political action committees and $1.1 million in donations from individuals. Renacci, an independently wealthy businessman, also loaned about $750,000 of his own money to the campaign. That’s the debt he’s now trying to pay off. About 15 percent of Renacci’s money came from PACs, about half was from individual donors, and about a third came from his own pocket.

Renacci accepted money from political action committees long before he won his election. Those that gave him $10,000 before November include committees representing Timken Co., Murray Energy and the American Health Care Association. The bulk of his PAC money came from committees operated by GOP politicians and from businesses, according to a Center for Responsive Politics breakdown of Renacci’s donations.

During the campaign, Renacci was up front about his political action committee backing, putting out news releases when well known conservative PACS like the Family Research Council Action PAC, the Ohio Right to Life PAC, the House Conservatives Fund, and The Citizens United Political Victory Fund, announced they’d back him.

Dictionaries define a hypocrite as someone whose actions contradict their stated beliefs. While Renacci publicly denounced Boccieri for accepting a large proportion of PAC money, he accepted PAC money himself all along, and continues to do so. He also publicly touted some of the ideological group PACs that backed his campaign.

So while there is an element of hypocrisy given Renacci’s past criticism, the DCCC’s indignation needs to be put in context, especially since its candidate received a majority of his contributions from PACs.

If Renacci’s PAC fundraising begins to outstrip his individual fundraising, he could end up deeper in hypocrisy territory. Meantime, we say the DCCC’s charge is Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAAF48C0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/13/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/democratic-congressional-campaign-committe-takes-l/
"['Georgia', 'Federal Budget', 'Jack Kingston']","
Congressman asks how many federal programs does it take to help homeless?
","
Georgia Congressman Jack Kingston wanted to be the guy to watch your tax dollars in Washington.

The Savannah Republican recently made an unsuccessful bid to chair the House Appropriations Committee, which oversees the distribution of federal funds. It's considered one of the most powerful positions in Washington. Republican House leaders voted in favor of Kentucky's Harold Rogers.

Kingston put together an 18-page presentation to make his case for the job. It was full of charts and numbers and graphs and a bandaged pig to illustrate the representative's big point -- that Washington's finances are being mismanaged, and Kingston had some conservative and innovative ideas to straighten things out.

The presentation also included some numbers listed as ""facts"" that made us curious: There are 16 programs to combat homelessness. It was listed under the headline ""end duplicative programs.""

Since fact-checking is our business, AJC PolitiFact Georgia couldn't pass this one up. Were there that many federal programs out there to help the homeless? And are they duplicative?

The congressman's office told us their numbers came from U.S. Sen. Tom Coburn, a Republican from Oklahoma.

Kingston's spokesman, Chris Crawford, said they believe federal efforts to help the homeless should be under one department, not the myriad of agencies that currently have programs to assist those without permanent shelter.

""Why are we duplicating the efforts so much?"" Crawford asked. ""Is there something that could be done to consolidate services?""

In 1987, Congress created the U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness to lead the federal government's efforts to aid homeless individuals and families. The agency's spokesman, Jason Kravitz, forwarded us its fiscal year 2009 report, which was released in April 2010. The ICH includes 19 federal departments and agencies, ranging from Health and Human Services to the Defense Department.

Kravitz said part of the ICH's mission since Barack Obama became president has been to ""break down the silos"" that some say exist among the various government agencies. Kravitz said there has been concerns that some federal agencies were unaware of what others were doing to help the homeless.

So does that mean there's duplication?

""Some [of the programs] target youth. Some target the mentally ill. Some target families,"" answered Sharon Price, the ICH's deputy director for policy.

We reviewed the FY 2009 report and found 27 federal programs to help the homeless. The programs cost at least $1.2 billion. The greatest number of them, eight, are within the Department of Veterans Affairs. One program is aimed at reintegrating homeless veterans back into society, another provides health care, one offers dental care, and another identifies and coordinates services.

Within Veterans Affairs, we found a Compensated Work Theory that, according to the FY 2009 report, ""endeavors to match and support work-ready veterans in competitive jobs, and to consult business and industry regarding their specific employment needs."" The VA budgeted $26.6 million toward that program. The Labor Department has a Veterans' Reintegration Program, which is ""the only nationwide program exclusively focused on assisting homeless veterans reintegrate into the workforce."" Its budget was $26.3 million.

The federal Health and Human Services Department has two programs that, in part, try to assist homeless people with mental health issues. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has a Supportive Housing program that has a component that works with people with severe mental illness. HUD's Shelter Care program also works with people who are ""seriously mentally ill.""

Additionally, there's an Emergency Food and Shelter program and Emergency Shelter grants.

Steve Berg, vice president of programs and policy for the Washington, D.C.-based National Alliance to End Homelessness, is familiar with virtually every federal program for the homeless. The programs, he said, are different. Berg did say some have ""similar functions,"" like the Emergency Food and Shelter program and Emergency Shelter grants. He noted that the grants go to state and local government, while the Food and Shelter program funding goes to large nonprofit organizations. Indeed, local governments can manage how the grants are used. Berg said it is ""highly unlikely"" that one person would get the same service from different programs.

Berg said some programs, like PATH, focus on implementing initiatives to help the homeless, while Grants for the Benefit of Homeless Individuals center on finding best practices to aid homeless Americans.

""There are reasons why each [program] exists,"" Berg said.

In summary, we found more federal programs aimed at helping the homeless than Kingston did. Some of the programs do share the same goals, although Berg noted there are some differences in who gets the funding and how they get used. We believe Kingston's statement is accurate, but more information shows there are some differences in about all of these programs. Kingston may not have gotten the assignment he wanted, but the congressman gets a pretty high mark on our rating system, Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBF39680>],/factchecks/2010/dec/13/jack-kingston/congressman-asks-how-many-federal-programs-does-it/
"['State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Bryan Kennedy']","
Union leader says Wisconsin state employees earn about 8 percent less than if they were in private sector
","
Targeted by Governor-elect Scott Walker, state employee unions in Wisconsin dominated the headlines in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel during the first days of December 2010.

Dec. 3: Walker targets early strike at state worker benefits

Dec. 7: Walker looks at showdown with state employee unions

Dec. 8: GOP leader floats right-to-work law

The common theme:

Walker and other Republicans, confronted with a state budget deficit of about $3 billion, want to cut state employee benefits.

Feeling the fire, union leader Bryan Kennedy stood up for state workers in a recent interview on WISN-TV in Milwaukee.

On the ""Upfront with Mike Gousha"" public affairs program, Gousha asked Kennedy if state employee unions ""have a perception problem with the general public.""

""Well, I think that there's been talking points used by those who don't like government to continually bash us and make us look as if we're the haves and we're really not,"" Kennedy replied during the Dec. 5, 2010 show.

""If you look across the board, we're averaging about 8 percent less than if we all worked in the private sector. Some of our people make half or a third as much as they could make if they worked in the private sector.""

Kennedy is president of the Wisconsin chapter of the American Federation of Teachers, known as AFT-Wisconsin. Despite its name, the union represents only a fraction of Wisconsin’s school teachers. Its 17,000 members include university and technical college faculty as well as a variety of other white-collar workers, including professionals such as nurses and lawyers, in state and local government.

Kennedy’s 8 percent number is awful specific. So we decided to take a look.

When we asked the basis for his statement, he provided two reports released in 2010 by two Washington, D.C., organizations.

Both studies compared state and private-sector employees taking into account differences in education, years of experience and other factors. That’s important because, on the whole, the average government worker has more education and earns a higher salary than a private-sector worker.

The first report, by the Economic Policy Institute, found that state workers across the country are paid 11 percent less than private-sector workers.

The difference is 7.6 percent less, the report said, if pay plus benefits are considered.

Kennedy described the 7.6 percent figure to PolitiFact Wisconsin as a ""pay differential."" He said he simply rounded it up to 8 percent in the Gousha interview.

Two problems here: 
The second report -- done by two University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professors for the National Institute of Retirement Security, whose board is largely composed of representatives of public employee pensions -- also was national in scope. But it did provide one Wisconsin statistic: From 2000 to 2008, the wages of state employees was 6.2 percent less than for private-sector employees.

Two more problems there: 
Beyond that, in his statement, Kennedy cited state employee pay.  

But when comparing state and private-sector workers, it is crucial to assess not only pay but benefits.

Historically, said UWM economics professor John Heywood, co-author of the second study cited by Kennedy, public employee unions have accepted lower pay in exchange for more generous benefits.

National studies, he said, have confirmed that state workers earn less but get higher benefits than private-sector employees -- although the overall difference is hard to calculate partly because benefits are complicated.

Indeed, many union leaders -- when defending higher benefits for public employees -- often point to the trade-off Heywood references: Higher benefits, but lower pay.

So, it’s ironic to now have the argument that low pay is the problem, without an acknowledgment of the higher benefits.

When it comes to benefits, pensions are often cited as more generous for government employees. In Wisconsin, that disparity was highlighted in a February 2010 study by the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank.

The study, done by an actuarial firm, calculated that a state employee in Wisconsin who earns $48,000 a year would retire with an estimated monthly pension benefit of $1,712. That is $411 more than a private-sector employee who earned $70,000 a year.

There are other sorts of benefits, of course, including health care and vacation time.

So what to make of Kennedy’s statement?

He said Wisconsin state employees are ""averaging about 8 percent less"" in pay than if they worked in the private sector. But the figure he relied on was from a national study that combined pay and benefits. A second study focused on state workers and pay, but it didn’t come out to 8 percent. What’s more, Kennedy’s statement skips a key point -- one union leaders have made over the years -- that pay is lower because benefits are higher.

In sum, Kennedy did not provide evidence that supports his claim, which itself provides only a partial look at the debate. If any more evidence emerges, we’ll review it. In the meantime, we rate Kennedy’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBD1AD40>],/factchecks/2010/dec/12/bryan-kennedy/union-leader-says-wisconsin-state-employees-earn-a/
"['Health Care', 'State Budget', 'Texas', 'Rick Perry']","
Gov. Rick Perry says federal health care overhaul to cost Texas $30 billion over ""next 10 years""
","
Stumping for his book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America From Washington, Texas Gov. Rick Perry often criticizes federal actions that he sees as overreaching, including the Democratic-steered health care overhaul that President Barack Obama signed into law in March. 
In a Dec. 3 interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network, Perry called the plan ""one of the greatest intrusions into our lives"" and objected to its ""massive cost"" to states. ""It will cost the State of Texas upwards of $30 billion over the next 10 years,"" Perry said. 
Why does the state expect the law to drive up its spending? One big reason is that it's projected to add about 2 million Texans to the number of people on Medicaid, the health insurance program for the poor and disabled whose costs are shared by federal and state government. 
The new Medicaid recipients fall into two groups. 
The first: People made eligible by the new law, which starting in 2014 is anyone who makes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level. (For a family of four, the level is $29,327. For a single person, it's $14,404.) This expansion will be a big change for Texas, which limits access to Medicaid more than most states. Currently, adult Texans without children do not qualify, and the vast majority of Medicaid beneficiaries are kids. 
The second: People who were eligible for Medicaid before the health care law passed but haven't signed up. According to Stephanie Goodman, a spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, some of these people are expected to come onto the rolls because of the requirement in the new law that all individuals obtain health insurance starting in 2014. 
These folks are more expensive for the state to serve than the first group because the federal government is expected to pay about 60 percent of their Medicaid costs, as opposed to almost all the costs for the newly eligible. 
We've heard state leaders talk about the projected costs before. In March, we rated Barely True Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst's statement that ""this federal plan costs Texas taxpayers $2.4 billion per year."" That number was based on a commission analysis that the law would cost Texas $24.3 billion over the decade running from 2014 through 2023. Dewhurst's statement was problematic on several fronts, partly because it was based on an outdated version of the law. 
In late March, the commission updated its 10-year cost estimate, raising it to $27 billion. At the time, Executive Commissioner Tom Suehs told lawmakers: ""I can tell you right now we have not included all the items we believe that'll have a fiscal impact to the state."" 
Here's how the $27 billion in costs breaks down: $9.5 billion for the ""Medicaid expansion"" enrollees — people made eligible by the federal law — and $8.6 billion for enrollees who were eligible for Medicaid before the new health care law passed. The rest, $8.9 billion, is what it would cost the state to continue higher payment rates that the new law mandates for primary care services. The federal government will fund the higher rates through 2014, but after that, state lawmakers will have to decide whether to chip in the money to continue paying providers more, Goodman said. If they do, the feds would share the cost as they do now for Medicaid. 
So, where does Perry get ""upwards of $30 billion over the next 10 years""? His spokeswoman, Katherine Cesinger, said that the governor simply ""rounded"" up from $27 billion and that he was referring to the 10-year period that starts in 2014. 
But ""the next 10 years"" begins in January, 2011. The commission's analysis puts the tab for 2011 through 2020 at $13.1 billion, half the 2014-23 estimate. And if lawmakers choose not to continue the provider rate increases, the total drops to $8.4 billion. 
An essential fact underlying all these figures: Health care reform becomes more expensive for the state as time goes on. Among the factors driving up costs down the line is the federal government's declining contribution for Medicaid. During the first three years of the Medicaid expansion (2014-2016), the feds pay all the cost of newly eligible enrollees. Starting in 2017, that federal share starts to drop, reaching 90 percent by 2020. 
Another essential fact: So far, we've only mentioned the cost of health care reform to the Health and Human Services Commission. A June report by State Comptroller Susan Combs enumerates other costs — as well as some financial benefits — to the state as a whole, although it doesn't offer a net figure. (The comptroller's report also uses a different time period than the commission's, focusing on the 10 years from 2010 through 2019.) 
For instance, on the expense side of the ledger is the mandated expansion of health plans administered by the Employees Retirement System of Texas, the University of Texas System and the Texas A&M University System. 
One of the pluses: The comptroller's office estimates that the state will receive $1.3 billion in new revenue from a tax on premiums charged by insurers and health maintenance organizations licensed by the Texas Department of Insurance. 
As for the projected increase in Medicaid costs, the comptroller's report jibes with the health commission's estimates. But it also tabulates the hefty federal contribution. For every dollar the state spends on new Medicaid enrollees through 2019, the federal government will spend $13, according to the figures in the report. The total federal contribution: $76 billion. 
We asked Perry why he had focused solely on the commission's cost projections. Cesinger told us: ""We fully recognize there will be additional costs to state government separate from the (health commission) costs. Unfortunately, those additional costs are difficult to calculate because it depends on factors yet to be determined,"" including how parts of the law are implemented. 
All told, Perry's sweeping statement is correct in one sense — federal health care reform will eventually cost the state billions. But he errs on several fronts. The latest cost projection from the Texas health commission is $27 billion, not $30 billion; the estimate covers 2014 through 2023, not the next 10 years; and it speaks only to a single state entity, not all of state government. 
We rate Perry's statement Barely True.

Tourism director says Rhode Island spends just 10 percent of U.S. average to promote tourism
","
Rhode Island hasn't always done a good job of promoting itself as a tourist destination.

During the 1980s, the state created catchy ads touting Rhode Island as ""the biggest little state in the Union,"" yet didn't invest money to run them outside the Ocean State. Other slogans such as ""America's First Resort"" and ""Our People Make Us Great"" never really caught on. (We couldn't even remember them. We had to look them up.)

So it seemed plausible when Mark Brodeur, director of the state's tourism division, told The Journal that Rhode Island's current tourism budget is $720,000, which he said is less than 10 percent of the $11 million that, on average, other states spend promoting tourism.

But we wanted to know whether the level is really that low, especially if you factor in Rhode Island's small size.

Our first stop was a call to Brodeur's office, where we asked for the source of his numbers. He wasn't available for an immediate answer so we did some digging on our own.

New Hampshire's Division of Travel & Tourism Development had no trouble coming up with numbers. Spokesman Tai Freligh e-mailed us a January 2010 report from the U.S. Travel Association, an industry group in Washington, D.C., that surveyed tourism budgets for 2008 to 2009.

It reports that Rhode Island ranked 48th out of 48 states when it came to spending money on tourism promotion. (The report had no data for Massachusetts or New Jersey.) It listed the median state expenditure for state tourism offices as nearly $11.8 million, the ""average"" Brodeur was apparently referring to.

Ten percent of $11.8 million would be $1.18 million. The $720,000 Rhode Island spends is, in fact, less than 10 percent of that (8.5 percent, in fact). 

So far so good.

Then the Rhode Island Economic Development Corporation, at Brodeur's request, sent us statistics, citing U.S. Travel as the source, that seemed more complete.

According to the newer figures for the now-complete 2010 fiscal year, Rhode Island again ranked dead last on the total amount spent. Second from the bottom was Connecticut, which cut its tourism spending from $5.7 million for the 2009 fiscal year to $981,538 the following year.

The median amount spent by a state was $10.2 million. Even if Rhode Island was spending $1 million promoting tourism, we would still be 10 percent below the norm, according to the numbers Brodeur's office sent us.

Brodeur's statement continued to ring true.

However, when we adjusted the numbers to account for Rhode Island's size, it revealed a different story.

But first, for the benefit of people who are savvy in math, we have to nitpick.

The ""average"" state tourism budget numbers that we've been citing ($11.8 million in 2009 and $10.2 million in 2010) aren't really averages. They're medians -- or the amounts spent by the two states in the middle of the list, as ranked by the amount spent. (The true average in both years is actually higher -- $13.5 million in 2010, for example -- because a few states such as Hawaii and California spent a disproportionately higher amount.)

So far, the distinction hasn't mattered. Whether you talk about average or median, Rhode Island's spending is 10 percent below either figure.

Now let's talk about per person (also known as per capita) spending.

We divided each state expenditure by the state's population, using U.S. Census Bureau estimates for July 1, 2009.

Suddenly our ranking improves, but not by much.

For 2010, Rhode Island was fifth from the bottom, at 68 cents per person. Only Ohio, Indiana, New York and Connecticut spent less.

But the amount wasn't low enough for Brodeur's statement to be accurate. According to our calculations, based on the numbers provided by the EDC, states, on average, spent $4.69 per person promoting tourism. The median was $2.40 per person.

Ten percent of the average spent would be 47 cents. Ten percent of the median spent would be 24 cents.

At 68 cents, we were well above both those amounts.

When Brodeur says that Rhode Island spends less than 10 percent of what the average state spends promoting tourism, that's true only if you ignore each state's population. Once that is factored into the equation, no matter which ""average"" you look at, his statement is wrong. 
But in the end, Brodeur's broader point that, compared with other states, Rhode Island spends very little promoting tourism is correct, especially when you take into consideration the fact that Rhode Island's tourism office had a budget of nearly $3 million in 1994.

So Brodeur gets an ""I survived the Truth-O-Meter"" T-shirt and a ruling of Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8ABC80>],/factchecks/2010/dec/12/mark-brodeur/tourism-director-says-rhode-island-spends-just-10-/

Rep. Jim Moran says Bush tax cuts did not improve employment and work-force participation
","

Democratic Congressman Jim Moran didn’t want tax cuts then, and he doesn’t want them now.

Explaining his vote against any extension of the Bush-era cuts, Moran paints the acts in 2001 and 2003 as abject failures.

""When the Bush plan was first proposed in 2001, the great cost of those tax cuts was sold to the public as a means of generating economic growth. That has proven to be false. The decade that followed the 2001 tax cuts featured the slowest average annual growth since World War II,"" he said in a Dec. 2 press release.

Moran continues: ""Nor did lower taxes increase employment. Work-force participation fell in 2001 and has never returned to the record level set in 2000 – before the tax cuts took effect.""

We were intrigued by the Congressman’s correlation between employment and the tax cuts. So we looked into the numbers.

Asked for a source, Moran’s chief of staff, Austin Durrer, sent us a New York Times business blog post by David Leonhardt, which does reinforce the congressman’s statement. 
Getting to the bottom of Moran's claim required us to examine two contentions in the congressman's statement: 1) That overall U.S. employment was not increased by the Bush tax cuts; 2) That work-force participation actually fell. 
These two contentions may sound similar, but in the specialized world of economists they are defined differently and involve separate sets of statistics.

Employment

""Nor did lower taxes increase employment,"" Moran said.

There were 132 million Americans employed when the first round of Bush tax cuts passed in June, 2001, according to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics. There were 130.5 employed at the end of last month. That’s a decrease of 1.5 million workers. 
So technically, Moran is correct. But he omits an important consideration: After the more-sweeping second round of tax cuts took effect in June 2003, there was a significant increase of jobs that lasted until recession’s onset at the end of 2007.

There were 129.8 million Americans employed in June, 2003 and almost 138 million with jobs in December, 2007. That’s an increase of 8.2 million workers.

The recession at the end of the decade is the great equalizer that makes Moran’s statement factually accurate. But you can’t dismiss that the number of workers steadily increased for better than four years after the second Bush tax cut.

So we’d rate Moran’s statement that lower taxes did not increase employment Half True.

Work-force participation

""Work-force participation fell in 2001 and has never returned to the record level set in 2000 -- before the tax cuts took effect,"" Moran said.

Work-force participation is the percentage of the population 16 and older that is employed. Most economists regard it as a more meaningful measure of employment than the total number of Americans working. Here’s why:

The total employment figure does not take into account that the United States’ population is growing and additional workers enter the job market every day. The U.S. has to create about 125,000 new jobs a month just to keep its employment and unemployment rates steady.

The measure of work-force participation includes population growth.

Moran is correct in saying work-force participation peaked in 2000. The high-water mark came in April that year when 64.7 percent of the U.S. population -- 16 and older -- had jobs.

In June, 2001, when the first Bush  tax cuts were approved, participation was at 63.7 percent. Last month, it was 58.2 percent -- the lowest measure since mid-1983.

The participation percentages varied slightly from passage of the second Bush tax cuts to the start of the recession. In June, 2003, participation was 62.3 percent; it was 62.7 percent in December, 2007.

Economists caution against measuring the success or failure of tax cuts by employment figures.

""The point of the tax rate cuts was to increase incentives for working, saving, and investing -- and therefore productivity and growth,"" said Brian Riedl, lead budget analyst for the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""Labor Force Participation is just one variable. There is also job totals, work hours, investment, productivity, etc. Those variables all responded well.""

Gary Burtless, a senior fellow specializing in labor market policy with the left-leaning Brookings Institution, says Moran’s point is valid. But he, too, says labor force growth is a small component in measuring the effectiveness of tax cuts.

""Tax changes can affect participation rates, though their impact has often been greatly exaggerated, especially by folks self-identifying as supply siders,"" he said.

So it’s fair to argue that the merits of tax cuts should not be reduced to employment figures. But Moran is accurate when he says work-force participation fell after 2000 and the tax cuts did not restore them to previous highs. We rate this part of his statement True.

Summary

Moran says the Bush tax cuts failed to boost jobs. He cites two measurements.

As he notes, total employment didn’t go up over the decade. But he neglects to mention numbers were on the rise before the advent of the worst economic downturn in 80 years. He’s half right here.

He’s correct in saying work-force participation fell since a record in 2000.

When you put both parts of his statement together, we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC8D6740>],/factchecks/2010/dec/11/jim-moran/rep-jim-moran-says-bush-tax-cuts-did-not-improve-e/

David Dewhurst says you can't check out a library book without a photo ID
","
Advocating for a law that would require Texas voters to present photo IDs at the polls, Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst told an interviewer this summer that ""you can't get on a plane without a photo ID, you can't buy Sudafed without a photo ID, you can't check out a library book without a photo ID . . . We need to protect the sanctity of our votes,"" he told a representative of Americans for Prosperity in a June 11 interview at the Republican State Convention in Dallas.

Most everyone knows that airline passengers have to hand up a photo ID before going through airport security. And since 2005, Texas pharmacies have been required by state law to make a person purchasing pills containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine or nopseudoephedrine to display a driver's license or other ID containing the purchaser's photograph, as noted online by the Texas State Board of Pharmacy. Sudafed, a decongestant, contains pseudoephedrine, according to WebMD, a medical information website.

But showing your ID to check out a library book?

To our inquiry, Dewhurst spokesman Mike Walz shared information we confirmed indicating that applicants for library cards from the Austin, Dallas or San Antonio public libraries must present a photo ID. His point: If a photo ID is needed to get a card, that's like requiring a photo ID to check out a book. You need a card before you can check out a book.

In Austin, according to its library website, adults seeking a card must apply in person at any branch and present a current photo ID plus proof of home address. Minors seeking a youth card may also apply at any branch, with a parent or guardian, the site says. ""They should bring current photo ID and proof of current residence address,"" a library site says.

Next, we looked into whether libraries around the country have identical photo-ID policies.

Not so, according to Amy Sargent, spokeswoman for the Chicago-based Public Library Association, a division of the American Library Association. Sargent, who undertook an overview at our request, said via e-mail that ""for as many listings we found of libraries that require a photo ID, we found as many that don't, so it's safe to say that the requirement is not nationally consistent"" or ""even consistent among types of libraries (urban, suburban, rural, etc...).""

""Even if a photo ID is a primary requirement,"" her e-mail says, ""many libraries seem to make concessions for people without IDs.""

According to the association, individuals seeking a Chicago library card must present a current ID with their photo or two pieces of current identification, such a a personal check, voter registration card or a current telephone, gas, electric or cable TV bill. Applicants for cards from the El Paso public library must show a photo ID or, if lacking picture identification, one type of non-photo ID with their name and current address.

According to the association, applications for a card from the Montgomery County (Md.) library must be accompanied by ""official identification,"" such as a driver's license, a check with pre-printed address or a postmarked letter addressed to the applicant.

Photo IDs are required to get cards at libraries in San Diego, Calif.; Scottsdale, Ariz.; Manchester, N.H.; and Troy, Mich., Sargent said.

And what about practices in Texas? Gloria Meraz, director of communications for the Texas Library Association, said local communities set their own policies. At our request, she asked librarians to share their approaches. From the responses, we learned that the Plano Public Library does not require a photo ID from applicants for library cards, while public libraries in Alamo, Allen, Baytown, Haslet, Irving, Richardson, Taylor and Wells Branch do have the ID hurdle.

Broadly, many libraries require photo IDs to get a card, some do not. Still, we found no instances of libraries requiring a photo ID when actually checking out a book.

Walz of Dewhurst's office said the lieutenant governor makes his point. ""If there are libraries that do not require a photo ID"" to get a card, ""there are certainly some that do,"" Walz said.

Our take: Dewhurst's claim confuses activities that are subject to uniform regulations in Texas--boarding a plane, purchasing Sudafed--with one that is subject to inconsistent, local rules. 
Photo IDs are always required to board a plane or purchase Sudafed, while public libraries simply don't require photo IDs at checkout. However, patrons of most libraries have to show a photo ID when applying for a library card, a factor that gives Dewhurst's statement an element of truth.

Bernie Sanders says ExxonMobil paid no taxes in 2009, but that's inaccurate
","
On Nov. 30, 2010, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent from Vermont, made a Senate floor speech about the gap between rich and poor in America. It soon went viral on the Internet. After receiving a number of requests by readers to fact-check it, we're doing so. (This predated Sanders' filibuster on Dec. 10, but he made many of the same points in both speeches.) 
We'll take a look at two of the claims Sanders made in the Nov. 30 speech. In this item, we'll look at whether Sanders is correct about the tax bill paid by oil giant ExxonMobil. In a separate item, we examined how Sanders characterized the income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans. 
In the Nov. 30 speech,  Sanders said that the government wasn't doing enough to hold companies such as ExxonMobil accountable. ""These people want to cut back on the powers of the EPA and the Department of Energy so that ExxonMobil can remain the most profitable corporation in world history while oil and coal companies continue to pollute our air and our water. Last year, ExxonMobil made $19 billion in profit. Guess what. They paid zero in taxes. They got a $156 million refund from the IRS. I guess that is not good enough. We have to give the oil companies even more tax breaks."" 
When we asked Sanders' office for a source of his claim that the company ""paid zero in taxes,"" they pointed us to page 92 of the company's ""10-K"" form filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Feb. 26, 2010. The form does indeed include a line that suggests that the company was refunded  $156 million in income taxes to the federal government in 2009. But there are two caveats that need to be included when citing this figure. 
What does the number actually mean? 
Douglas A. Shackelford, a tax professor at the Kenan-Flagler Business School at the University of North Carolina told PolitiFact that the $156 million number refers ""to the U.S portion of the current and deferred income tax expense."" But he added that this number does not refer to the cash taxes paid by Exxon to the U.S. government. 
""It is a (Generally Accepted Accounting Principles) number, not a figure from their U.S. corporate tax return,"" Shackelford said. ""The actual income taxes paid by the Exxon to the U.S. government is confidential information. It is not reported in their financial statements."" 
The company agreed with that description. ""The U.S. income taxes reported in the financial statements include more than ExxonMobil’s tax bill for 2009,"" said Exxon spokesman Alan Jeffers. The financial statements, he said, ""reflect financial transactions related to U.S. federal income taxes booked by the corporation during the year and include finalization of the taxes for prior years."" 
For instance, the liberal Center for American Progress quoted Jeffers saying that the company's tax figure for 2009 was heavily influenced by a holdover tax issue from 2008 that was technically recorded on its 2009 books. ""ExxonMobil was required to bolster its pension plan by $3 billion when the market went down in 2008,"" wrote CAP's Sima J. Gandhi. ""This overpayment reduced the amount of taxes owed in 2008, but the tax adjustment wasn't made until one year later, which led to an overpayment and the refund in 2009."" 
The three-year tax numbers listed on the 10-K do seem to suggest that the company's 2009 tax bill was unusual. In 2007 and 2008, the equivalent tax totals on the 10-K were $4.5 billion and $3.4 billion, respectively, which suggests that some unusual factor reduced the ExxonMobil tax bill into negative territory for 2009. 
While the company is not obligated to publicize its tax return, and thus the actual amount it paid in taxes, ExxonMobil has voluntarily released a figure for its actual federal income tax bill in response to media requests that questioned why the company reported a negative tax liability in 2009. Jeffers told PolitiFact that the ""U.S. income tax expense for 2009 activities was approximately $500 million."" The company declined to provide documentation for this number, however. 
U.S. income taxes aren't the only taxes ExxonMobil paid 
According to the 10-K, ExxonMobil remitted $6.3 billion in sales taxes, $110 million in state income taxes, and $1.5 billion in ""other taxes and duties."" All told, the company's tax liability according to its 10-K was $7.7 billion. (These numbers are not necessarily totals actually paid but derived using generally accepted accounting principles.) And that only counts taxes paid in the U.S. It paid an additional $70 billion-plus in taxes to foreign governments in 2009, $15 billion of which was for income taxes. 
The company does receive credit on its U.S. taxes for many of these foreign tax payments, which helps keep its domestic tax bill lower than it would otherwise be -- a complaint of many of its critics, who would like to see a curtailment of such benefits. Another criticism is that the company is (legally) able to shield some of its income by steering it through subsidiaries based offshore. 
Sanders spokesman Will Wiquist said that ""some have argued that these facts are not accurate because the company paid state and foreign taxes and because they lawfully wrote off the foreign taxes when paying their American federal taxes. Clearly, that is not the point of this statement by Sen. Sanders. He is arguing that the law should be changed to make companies like Exxon pay U.S. income taxes on their massive profits."" 
We agree that the tax policy toward companies like ExxonMobil is a fair subject for debate, but we do think that Sanders' articulation of the facts in his floor speech was misleading, because he omitted several important caveats, including a failure to note that the $156 million number only refers to one specific type of tax -- U.S. income taxes. To his credit, Sanders did make that distinction in a June 9, 2010, speech, saying that ExxonMobil ""reported to the SEC that not only did it avoid paying any federal income taxes, it actually received a $156 million refund from the IRS."" 
Still, while focusing on the negative-$156 million figure and saying that the company ""paid zero in taxes"" in 2009 was eye-catching, it is, at best, misleading. And it ignores the fact that the company paid hundreds of millions in state income taxes, sales taxes and other types of taxes. We can't verify the company's claim that its net tax was $500 million in 2009, but it's incorrect for Sanders to say ""paid zero in taxes."" We rate his claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB4ECC0>],/factchecks/2010/dec/10/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-filibuster-exxon-mobil/
"['Florida', 'Bill Montford']","
Democratic senator says state already cutting jobs, cites study
","
On the campaign trail, Gov.-elect Rick Scott promised to cut the state workforce by 5 percent. But now some Democrats are using a new state study to say the cuts aren't needed.

The Department of Management Services released its annual state workforce report on Dec. 8, 2010. The report profiles the number of state employees and their salaries, and it offers comparisons to state government workers nationwide.

That comparison is quite favorable, said state Sen. Bill Montford, D-Tallahassee.

""We're getting a good deal from our state workers,"" Montford said after digesting the results of the report.

""Facing the financial crisis that we are, I understand why anyone would say we have to cut back across the board, but we have less employees this year than we did last year,"" Montford told the Tallahassee Democrat. ""We're already reducing the size of government.""

As part of Scott's ""7-7-7"" plan to create about 700,000 private sector jobs in seven years, Scott has said he wants to trim 5 percent of the state workforce. Scott says that the workforce reduction would save almost $300 million, and that history shows Florida's economy grows better when government spending is lowered.

But Montford, like Democratic gubernatorial nominee Alex Sink, argues that the state government already is pretty lean. As proof, he says the state workforce is shrinking.

That's the statement we're checking here.

Highlights from the report

Florida in 2009 had the lowest ratio among the 50 states of full- and part-time state employees to overall population, and the second lowest ratio of full-time equivalent employees to population (Illinois ranked ahead of Florida), according to DMS.

Florida also had the lowest payroll expenditures per resident -- $38 -- in the country, the DMS found, using public payroll expenditures submitted to the United States Census Bureau. The national average was $72 per resident.

A word of caution about both figures -- Florida, because of its large population, has a comparative advantage using these types of calculation when compared to states with smaller populations. Those states still have to provide most or all of the public services that Florida does, but just for fewer people. Delaware and North Dakota, for instance, both have nearly three times as many state employees per resident when compared with Florida, and spend three times more on payroll per resident.

A couple of other interesting figures -- women occupy more than 56 percent of traditional state government jobs, but less than 40 percent of senior management positions, and women across the board make less on average than their male colleagues. Male employees in the state personnel system earn $45,715 on average while women earn $40,496.

State employee count

Montford, in his comments, focuses on the state employee count. There are a couple of different ways the state takes a head count.

Most figures refer to employees in the state personnel system -- those are the traditional government workers from state departments and agencies. But university employees -- professors and researchers and others -- are technically state workers, too. So are all the state courts and judicial system. On top of that, the state measures the government workforce by both budgeted positions, and the actual number of employees.

Luckily, regardless of how you classify the number of state employees, the results are generally the same.

But not necessarily a ringing endorsement of Montford's point.

The total budgeted state workforce as of June 30, 2010, stood at 167,797 -- 857 employees less than in 2009, and 5,689 employees less than in 2008. But the state in 2010 had 529 more employees than it did on Dec. 31, 2006, according to DMS.

If you look only at the state personnel system employees -- those that work directly for the government in an agency or department -- the gaps shrink ever more. The state system budgeted for a total of 109,020 employees in 2010, 456 employees less than its 2009 total (a 0.4 percent decrease) and 154 more than at the end of 2006 (a 0.1 percent increase).

So in budgeted head counts, the state cut back ever so slightly from 2009 to 2010, but still has a bigger workforce than it did four years ago.

The actual employee figures track the same way. State personnel system employees dropped from 105,174 in 2009 to 105,031 this year (difference of 143 people, or a 0.1 percent decline). But the number of employees increased 0.6 percent overall from 2006 to 2010.

We tried to contact Montford's office to see which figure specifically he was citing, but we did not hear back.

Conclusion

In arguing that Scott's plan to shrink the state workforce 5 percent may be illogical, Montford noted that the state already is cutting its head count. He's technically right -- a Department of Management Services report released on Dec. 8 found that the state workforce shrunk from 2009 to 2010. But hardly in a measurable or significant way. Sometimes we find a statement is accurate but still needing clarification or additional information, and that's the case here.

The state workforce shrunk between 0.1 and 0.4 percent depending on how you calculate it in 2010. But the workforce is bigger than it was at the end of 2006. We think those two facts combined seriously shade Montford's statement. So we say Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EDE0D480>],/factchecks/2010/dec/10/bill-montford/democrat-senator-says-state-already-cutting-jobs-c/

Bernie Sanders, in viral speech, says top 1 percent earn more than 23 percent of U.S. income
","
On Nov. 30, 2010, Sen. Bernie Sanders, an Independent from Vermont, made a Senate floor speech about the gap between rich and poor in America. It soon went viral on the Internet. After receiving a number of requests from readers to fact-check it, we decided to do just that. 
We'll take a look at two of the claims Sanders made. In this item, we'll look at how Sanders characterizes the income earned by the top 1 percent of Americans. In a separate item, we'll look at whether Sanders is correct about the tax bill paid by oil giant ExxonMobil. 
Here's a portion of Sanders' speech, which came during Senate debate over extending tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush. Democrats and Republicans divided over whether the cuts should be extended for the wealthiest Americans. 
""Mr. President, in the year 2007, the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income,"" Sanders said. ""The top 1 percent earned 23.5 percent of all income--more than the entire bottom 50 percent. That is apparently not enough. The percentage of income going to the top 1 percent has nearly tripled since the 1970s. In the mid-1970s, the top 1 percent earned about 8 percent of all income. In the 1980s, that figure jumped to 14 percent. In the late 1990s, that 1 percent earned about 19 percent."" 
To keep matters simple, we'll stick to checking Sanders' claim that ""the top 1 percent of all income earners in the United States made 23.5 percent of all income,"" which is ""more than the entire bottom 50 percent."" 
When we asked Sanders' office for a source, they pointed us to a study dated Aug. 5, 2009 by University of California (Berkeley) economist Emmanuel Saez, ""Striking it Richer: The Evolution of Top Incomes in the United States (update with 2007 estimates)."" We looked at the paper and found this line: The top 1 percent ""has gone through enormous fluctuations along the course of the twentieth century, from about 18 percent (of income) before WWI, to a peak to almost 24 percent in the late 1920s, to only about 9 percent during the 1960s-1970s, and back to almost 23.5 percent by 2007."" An accompanying chart confirmed the 23.5 percent figure for 2007. 
In a chart subsequently updated by Saez and forwarded to us by Sanders' office, the percentage of income earned by the top 1 percent actually fell modestly by 2008, to just under 21 percent. Still, Sanders was specific in his speech about referring to 2007, and the number he cited was calculated by a credentialed academic economist specializing in income and wealth statistics -- a pretty credible source, in our view. So the number looked pretty solid to us. 
Still, we've looked at a similar question before, so we were aware that various economists have attempted to grapple with this question. In the interest of making extra certain that Sanders was right, we decided to see whether the results in the Saez study mirrored those published elsewhere. 
One paper we found is by Arthur B. Kennickell, assistant director of the Federal Reserve Board's Division of Research and Statistics. This paper, published Jan. 7, 2009, found that the top 1 percent's share of income was 21.4 percent in 2007 -- slightly lower than the 23.5 percent that Sanders cited but certainly in the ballpark. That's also higher than the 14.6 percent taken by the bottom 50 percent, which is consistent with what Sanders had said. 
Another study, published in 2010 by Adrian Dungan and Kyle Mudry of the Internal Revenue Service's Individual Returns Analysis Section, found the top 1 percent taking 22.8 percent of income. Once again, this is slightly lower than what Sanders quoted, but in the same vicinity. That was also well over the 12.3 percent earned by the bottom 50 percent, which is once again consistent with what Sanders said. 
The differences from study to study likely stem from two factors -- the source of the data (using information from tax returns rather than surveys of American families, for instance) and the definition of ""income"" (such as whether capital gains are included in the calculations). When we asked Kennickell whether there was some reason to prefer one study over another, he responded that they all have their own merits. ""There are many definitions of income that may be appropriate for various purposes,"" he said. 
So, we're left with three studies that vary slightly but which all point in the same general direction -- showing the top 1 percent earning between 21.4 and 23.5 percent of the national income in 2007. The studies also show that this share exceeds what the entire bottom 50 percent of the United States earns. So we rate Sanders' statement True. ",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EC7B6F00>],/factchecks/2010/dec/10/bernie-sanders/bernie-sanders-viral-speech-says-top-1-percent-ear/
"['Health Care', 'Small Business', 'State Budget', 'Wisconsin', 'Scott Walker']","
Scott Walker says that eliminating state tax on health savings accounts would increase the number of small businesses offering health insurance
","
Governor-elect Scott Walker promises to ""open Wisconsin for business"" on Jan. 3, with his first official act to be convening an emergency session of the Legislature to consider economic development measures aimed at creating jobs.

That package will include a change in state law -- sought by the business community -- that was rebuffed in the past by Gov. Jim Doyle and his fellow Democrats: a state income tax credit for contributions to health saving accounts.

Walker included a pledge to eliminate the tax as one of his campaign promises, declaring on his website that the change would ""make it easier for small business owners to provide health insurance to their employees.""

In other words, more health coverage -- even without a mandate from Washington.

On Dec. 9, 2010, Walker unveiled some details of his HSA plan -- and again pitched its importance. We had decided days earlier to look at the issue, and had contacted his campaign office about it. So, a special thanks to them for going out of their way to make this item extra timely.

During the campaign, as the campaign website shows, Walker positioned  the change as a boon to the employers of the state. So that’s our starting point.

Some background: Wisconsin is among only four states that do not allow employees to deduct their contributions to health savings accounts. There already is a federal tax deduction available.

Supporters see the plans as a key to keeping health care costs under control. Opponents, such as Gov. Jim Doyle, argue that such savings accounts benefit only higher income workers -- and note that the change would cost the state millions in lost tax revenue at a time of huge budget deficits.  

Health savings accounts are allowed with plans that have deductibles of at least $1,200 for individual and $2,400 for family coverage. With such plans, workers (and employers if they choose to do so) can set aside money into a spending account for employees to use on health care expenses.

Many businesses have embraced high-deductible plans, which typically mean lower premiums than on conventional insurance plans.

""They’re an important tool"" toward keeping the cost of health insurance down, said Jon Rauser, a Milwaukee insurance broker who serves small businesses.

What does it mean for those with accounts?

On an account with $3,000 in annual contributions, the annual state tax credit would be about $195.

Let’s underline: That’s what the employee would receive on his or her tax return.

What about the argument, as the Walker campaign advanced, that this would help the bottom line for businesses?

Steve Baas, legislative director for the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce, says businesses believe the current rules could discourage workers from signing up with a plan that includes a HSA.

""It’s incredibly frustrating,"" he said. ""Why are we an outlier on this?""

In a letter to its members in spring of 2010, the MMAC in a letter called the lack of a deduction ""an unwarranted tax on employees.""

Walker transition spokesman Cullen Werwie argued allowing HSA contributions to be deducted would put Wisconsin on par with most other states by removing a competitive disadvantage for state businesses.

However, neither Werwie nor others involved with the issue said they were aware of any business that was holding off on high deductible plans because of the state tax issue.

""Does an employer really care about an employee’s tax situation?"" said Paul Fronstin of the Washington, D.C.-based Employee Benefit Research Institute. ""I don’t know if that amount of (tax savings) money makes any difference.""

Fronstein said about 10 million Americans were covered by health plans that were deemed eligible for HSA accounts.

Doyle vetoed versions of the bill in 2004 and 2006.

In his 2004 veto message, the governor said he feared that expanded use of HSAs ""could decrease employer-sponsored insurance coverage.

""Additionally, HSAs are only viable for healthy persons with higher incomes,"" Doyle wrote. ""As healthy individuals with higher incomes opt out of traditional insurance pools, the risk profiles of these existing health plans will worsen, which in turn will cause insurance companies to raise rates on remaining members likely to be those without any other options.""

It’s a little unclear what the exact cost to the state coffers would be if the tax break was allowed.

Doyle noted in 2004 the proposal would cost the state some $38.7 million over eight years; his 2006 veto message put the cost at $50 million but didn’t say over what period of time he was referring to. A version of the bill introduced last spring included a fiscal note that said it would cost $14.8 million in fiscal year 2011.

Walker’s announcement Dec. 9 said that under his measure ""taxpayers will save $4 million to $8 million in lower taxes if HSAs are tax-exempt."" However, those estimates were based on a fiscal note from the 2005 version of the bill.

The issue is bigger than the dollar impact of the tax deduction for employees, said John Torinus, retired chairman of Serigraph Corp. who has advised Walker on economic issues.

He said the change would ""remove a small impediment"" to getting workers into high deductible plans and ""would send a signal that the state of Wisconsin wants consumer driven health plans.""

Rauser said when he speaks before companies considering the plans, he has to remind workers that Wisconsin does not allow a tax deduction on the accounts. He termed it ""more of a nuisance than an impediment"" to getting workers to sign up for them.

But again, that’s on the side of the employee, not the employer.

State Sen. Alberta Darling (R-River Hills), a sponsor of the measures Doyle vetoed and a subsequent bill that died in the last session, said without the break, ""employers have trouble convincing their employees (having high deductible plans) is an advantage.""

HSA plans also lead to more prudent spending on health care because employees use health care providers more prudently, she said, because ""they have skin in the game.""

What’s the bottom line?

The consensus is pretty clear: State workers who have health savings accounts are getting nicked by Madison. And allowing them to take a tax deduction would bring Wisconsin in line with most other states. That may all be true. But Walker is arguing that a tax break for individuals -- not employers -- would boost the number of small businesses that provide health insurance.

He and other supporters have provided no evidence it would. We rate that statement Barely True.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EAB46800>],/factchecks/2010/dec/10/scott-walker/scott-walker-says-eliminating-state-tax-health-sav/

Oregon Right to Life encourages Oregonians to take advantage of a ‘no-cost’ political donation
","
One of Oregon's better known political action committees, Oregon Right to Life, has taken to the newspaper pages to remind you that it appreciates presents just as much as anyone else.

But, in case you’re not feeling particularly politically philanthropic this season, Right to Life is sweetening the pot. In a recent ad in the Catholic Sentinel, the group tells readers that making a difference (i.e. donating) is ""free"" and ""easy.""

""Announcing an amazing no-cost way to fight abortion,"" the ad says.

We love seeing ""free"" and ""no cost."" Mostly in conjunction with sales, but also here because it’s a tell-tale sign of a good fact check.

The ad urges people ""to use some of your taxes to help prevent abortion"" and says the group uses the money ""to help elect pro-life candidates in Oregon."" According to the ad, individual Oregonians can make a $50 political donation ($100 for couples) to Oregon Right to Life and get a tax credit back in the very same amount. Amazing! But is it true?

We did some googling and found ourselves on the Oregon Department of Revenue’s website. Lo and behold, there it was, under a list of possible tax credits: ""Political contributions.""

""Oregon law allows a tax credit for political contributions,"" according to the site.

It makes sense, we suppose, why wouldn’t politicians pass a tax break that has the potential to help them?

Here are the details: Under Oregon tax law, an individual can donate up to $50 (again, $100 for a couple jointly filing) to a candidate or their principal campaign committee, a political action committee or a political party (national, state or local) and claim an equal credit on their return. Read more here.

The ruling is pretty evident; weird as it may seem, Oregon does allow you to make a small political contribution ‘for free’ by giving you a tax credit of up to $50. We rate this claim True.

Hit zombie series shows CDC blowing up after generators fail
","
OK, OK, enough of that political stuff.

The winter holidays approach. State politicians are hibernating. Now PolitiFact Georgia' staff can investigate what's really important. 

Is there a doomsday plan for Atlanta's Centers for Disease Control and Prevention?

""Huh?"" you ask. And ""Why?""

Because of AMC's hit series ""The Walking Dead."" Flesh-eating zombies take over Atlanta, and in Sunday's season finale, survivors who take refuge at the CDC find out things are even worse than they thought: The building is locked down and rigged to explode.

When the CDC's generators run out of fuel, a two-stage device more powerful than anything known to mankind short of a nuclear bomb will blow it to kingdom come.

""It sets the air on fire,"" fictional CDC scientist Dr. Edwin Jenner said. ""No pain. An end to sorrow, grief, regret. Everything.""

Thirty minutes later, KAAABOOOOM!!!! No more CDC.

Really?

Don't laugh. PolitiFact Georgia readers and more than a few Atlanta Journal-Constitution staffers asked PolitiFact to check whether the CDC has an endgame plan.

""The Walking Dead"" follows survivors of a plague that turns people into zombies. In the show's post-apocalypse Atlanta, the undead lurch down Marietta Street and through the countryside hungry for human innards.

The Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre stands in as the CDC's stunt double.

""The Walking Dead"" is by far the most popular show shot in Atlanta, according to ajc.com's Radio & TV Talk blog. It averaged 5 million viewers during the fall season, which is 2 million more than second-place Bravo's ""The Real Housewives of Atlanta.""

This makes it the most popular drama in basic-cable history among the coveted 18- to 49-year-old demographic.

And when a show this popular turns a major DeKalb County employer into a smoldering pit of rubble, AJC PolitiFact Georgia readers take notice.

We called the CDC. Officials there said the agency was not consulted during production of the show.

While the agency does have safeguards in case generators fail, a subnuclear blast is not one of them, spokeswoman Karen Hunter said. 

""We do have systems in place, but none of them involve explosives,"" Hunter said. 

The CDC has safeguards for a variety of emergencies, but they don't specifically address the possibility of the end of humanity. 

""We do not have a doomsday scenario at the CDC,"" Hunter said.

If for some reason the CDC were unable to operate from its main campus, designated employees would travel to another location and work from there, Hunter said.

Backup generators have failed at least twice in recent years. In June 2007, lightning knocked out power at the CDC's $214 million infectious disease building -- including the agency's six high-tech labs designed to contain Ebola, smallpox, avian influenza and other killer bugs.

In July 2008, a bird shorted out a Georgia Power transformer, cutting off power to part of the CDC's main campus.

Critics worried the generator failures showed the lab was unsafe. The Government Accountability Office investigated.

While ""The Walking Dead's"" CDC seemed to use fire as a kind of disinfectant, the real CDC typically uses other cleaning methods. 

In the second-to-last episode, Jenner accidentally spills a caustic chemical as he works in a lab, which automatically decontaminates by setting itself on fire.

In reality, CDC scientists disinfect spills with some very uncinematic household products, said Tom Skinner, another CDC spokesman. 

""Lysol and bleach,"" Skinner said. Materials used to clean the spill are burned, but not by a self-immolating lab. They use incinerators.

Scientists work with dangerous pathogens in rooms with negative airflow to prevent germs from leaking outside. Air entering and leaving those rooms is scrubbed with filters. Scientists wear protective suits.

While we are disappointed to find that real life is not nearly as cinematic as fiction, we walk away from our effort heartened. 

We are pleased to reassure the CDC's neighbors that they do not need to install flame-proof siding. The CDC said none of its emergency plans involve blowing up its campus.

Plus, the AJC reported two cases in which the CDC emergency generator failures did not coincide with subnuclear explosions. 

We rule ""The Walking Dead"" claim Pants On Fire. And by the way, we can't wait for Season 2.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBB0F240>],/factchecks/2010/dec/10/walking-dead/hit-series-shows-cdc-blows-after-zombie-apocalypse/

Arm of Democratic National Committee says Americans ""overwhelmingly"" support passage of DREAM Act
","
Calling for congressional approval of a measure enabling young illegal immigrants to work toward citizenship, a Texas arm of the Democratic National Committee said most Americans back the proposal. 
""An overwhelming majority of Americans  support passage of the DREAM Act, which would provide a path to citizenship for undocumented youth willing to work for a college degree or serve in our armed forces—individuals who are Americans in every way but their legal status,"" trumpets a Dec. 6 press release issued by Organizing for America - Texas. DREAM stands for Development, Relief and Education for Alien Minors. The Democratic-majority House approved the act this week, turning it over to the Senate. 
We hunted for evidence of that overwhelming support, turning first to a summary of the poll linked to OFA's press release. 
The telephone poll of 1,008 adults , conducted June 10-13, was commissioned by First Focus, an advocacy organization that describes itself as dedicated to making children and families a priority in federal policy and budget decisions. According to its poll summary, 70 percent of respondents favored the act. The poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent, the summary says. 
A breakout on the poll shows that when asked if they'd favor or oppose the act, 51 percent said they'd strongly favor it while 18 percent said they'd not-so-strongly favor it. Twenty-five percent said they'd oppose it. 
And how was the question framed? Before answering the pollster, respondents heard a positive description of the bill, prefaced with these words: ""Currently, illegal immigrant children who were brought to the U.S. at a young age and have grown up here and have no way to become legal citizens and fully contribute to society."" 
The poll script states the DREAM Act would address ""this problem"" by giving illegal immigrants brought here as young children ""the opportunity to work legally without fear of deportation and ultimately earn permanent legal resident status if they meet certain requirements."" It says students must have come here when they were very young, lived here at least five years, stayed out of trouble, earned a high-school diploma or GED and completed at least two years of college or military service. 
Finally, respondents were told the proposal ""has the potential to provide children and young people who meet these requirements with improved access to a higher education and a legal means by which to contribute to society."" 
We wondered why the emphasis on contributing to society. Wendy Cervantes, a First Focus vice president, told us that aspect is relevant considering the avenues that are closed to illegal immigrant children. ""They can't work, they can't drive, they can't really do anything legally,"" Cervantes said. 
Still, might the repeated reference to contributing to society sway respondents in favor of the act? Cervantes said that was not the intent. ""We slaved over the wording quite a bit, mostly because we didn't want people to think we were trying to lead anybody one way or another,"" she said. 
Cervantes also pointed out two other polls suggesting Americans support the act. 
In a Rasmussen Poll released Sept. 21, 52 percent of likely voters said children brought here illegally who complete two years of college should be afforded a path to legal status, according to a write-up posted online by the Washington Independent, which describes itself as an independent news service. Thirty-six percent said such children should not be given an opportunity to become citizens, the Independent reported. In the poll, 78 percent said children brought to the U.S. illegally who later serve in the military should get a chance to become citizens, the Independent says. Its article didn't offer more details; Rasmussen hasn't posted the full poll on its public site. 
A poll commissioned by America's Voice, which advocates comprehensive immigration reform including tighter border security and giving illegal immigrants already here a path to citizenship, showed 66 percent of voters supporting the act, according to a Nov. 10 memo from the polling firm, Lake Research Partners. The poll surveyed 1,200 likely voters Oct. 31-Nov. 2. 
Those respondents heard the act described as providing ""illegal immigrant students who were brought here as young children with the opportunity to earn permanent legal resident status"" if they'd been ""brought to the U.S. when they were very young, lived here for at least five years, stayed out of trouble, earned a high school diploma or GED, and completed at least two years of college or military service."" 
Respondents were polled about the DREAM Act after being asked whether deporting all 11 million illegal immigrants now in the country is unrealistic; 76 percent agreed, 21 percent disagreed. But overall, immigration was not a high-priority concern; only 2 percent ranked it as their most important issue in deciding who to vote for Congress. The economy and jobs, health care, the federal budget deficit, education and moral values came out as most important for more voters. 
We wondered if any polls show that most Americans oppose the act. An online search led us to a November poll commissioned by the Federation for American Immigration Reform, a group that advocates for stronger border security and stricter immigration laws. It found that 54 percent of 1,000 likely voters contacted Nov. 22 preferred to leave consideration of the act to the new (more Republican) Congress being sworn in early next year. The FAIR poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. 
Worth noting: The FAIR poll put a negative light on the current Congress, which is now considering the DREAM Act. Its first question: ""Should the lame-duck Congress limit its work to fiscal issues like the budget and taxes or should the lame-duck Congress use the opportunity to address social policies that were too politically difficult to deal with before the election?"" 
Next, the poll says the act ""offers legalization to about 2 million illegal immigrants,"" a reference to the number of people who would be potentially eligible to earn citizenship if the act passes into law. Each of its questions about the proposal sounds a warning note: 
1) ""In additional to legalization, the DREAM Act would entitle newly legalized illegal immigrants to benefit from subsidized tuition rates at all state colleges and universities, and qualify for low interest government educational loans. Based on this information, would you be much more likely to support, somewhat more likely to oppose or much more likely to oppose passage of the DREAM Act?"" Sixty-one percent replied they'd be more likely to oppose, 34 percent said they'd be more likely to support. 
2) Under the act, ""any illegal immigrant who files an application for legalization... would be protected from deportation so long as the application is pending. In addition, the government would be barred from using information provided in DREAM Act applications against the applicants, even if they are denied legalization."" Fifty-eight percent said the information made them more likely to oppose. 
3) Given this additional information, would you support or oppose action on the act by the lame duck Congress? Fifty-four percent said they opposed such action, 38 percent said they supported it. 
We ran what we learned about these polls past Karlyn Bowman, who analyzes polls for the Washington-based American Enterprise Institute. Bowman agreed the polls commissioned by First Focus and FAIR used language that potentially biased the responses. Also, Bowman said, she's wary of polls that gauge voter attitudes on specific measures that most Americans don't know that much about. ""When you (then) begin asking Americans about (such) specifics, that's pushing the polling instrument far beyond where it should go,"" she said. 
As we completed this article, Bowman pointed out a poll just released by the Gallup organization. The poll taken Dec. 3-6 of 1,003 adults, with a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points, found 54 percent of respondents saying they'd vote in favor of allowing illegal immigrants brought here as children to gain legal resident status if they joined the military or went to college. Forty percent said they'd vote against, 
We set aside the First Focus poll (in which 70 percent favored the act) and the FAIR poll (in which 54 percent opposed acting on it now) as unreliable. That leaves the Rasmussen poll, for which we have scant methodological information (52 percent of those voters favored the act), the poll taken for America's Voices (66 percent in favor) and the fresh Gallup poll ( 54 percent in favor of a key aspect of the act). 
""Overwhelming"" public support? That's questionable. But polling consistently shows a majority of Americans favor giving undocumented immigrant children a way to gain legal residency.",[<zip object at 0x000001B4EBC1C200>],/factchecks/2010/dec/10/organizing-america/arm-democratic-national-committee-says-americans-o/
