Jennifer Carroll says ""we didn't go out asking people"" to join the ""stand your ground"" task force
","
Lawmakers and lawyers clamored to join the task force set up by Gov. Rick Scott to examine Florida’s justifiable homicide laws after Trayvon Martin’s shooting death.

The clamoring turned to confusion when Lt. Gov. Jennifer Carroll, whom Scott designated co-chair, explained how the panel’s members were chosen.

""What we did was go to the individuals that seek our approval to be on the task force. We didn’t go out asking people,"" she said at an April 19 news conference. ""They came to us with an interest in this review, and those are the people of the pool that we went and looked at, who would be best to serve on this task force given the diversity of the state.""

Reporters asked Carroll about Sen. Chris Smith, a South Florida Democrat and prominent ""stand your ground"" critic who publicly asked to be on the panel.

""He did not apply,"" Carroll said. ""We went with the application, people that sent in information who were interested in serving on this task force.""

Carroll’s comments immediately surprised some lawmakers. As we heard doubts about an application process, we started digging up more information about how the committee came together.

Was Carroll accurate that no one recruited people to the task force?

In March, Scott said the task force would be led by Carroll and the Rev. R.B. Holmes of Tallahassee and comprised of appointees from Attorney General Pam Bondi, House Speaker Dean Cannon, Senate President Mike Haridopolos, Senate President-designate Don Gaetz and House Speaker-designate Will Weatherford.

Sen. Gary Siplin, D-Orlando, who was chosen to sit on the 19-member task force, said he knew nothing about an application. He simply told Haridopolos he was interested. The same goes for Smith. (Read Smith’s letter to Haridopolos.)

""When the governor announced his task force, he stated who he’d get recommendations from,"" said Smith, who started his own task force to look into the law. ""I called those people and expressed my desire to serve. And I’ve expressed publicly in many news outlets my desire to serve. So I was surprised that there was an application process that I did not know about.""

Here’s what we know about the process. In short, some members were chosen because they asked to be, like Carroll said. But we found several cases where task force members said explicitly that they were recruited, some by Carroll’s own chief of staff.

Haridopolos, the Senate president, recommended Scott choose one senator from a list of seven senators that included four Democrats -- Larcenia Bullard of Miami, Arthenia Joyner of Tampa, Siplin and Smith -- and three Republicans -- David Simmons of Altamonte Springs, Andy Gardiner of Orlando and Greg Evers of Crestview, according to a March 28 letter.

Siplin and Simmons made the cut.

Cannon also made a recommendation. Unlike Haridopolos, he went outside of his chamber. Public records show the House speaker recommended Orlando attorney Derek Bruce, who filled out a standard questionnaire for gubernatorial appointees.

""The speaker reached out to Mr. Bruce and recommended him to the governor because he thought he would be a good fit for the task force,"" said House spokesman Ryan Duffy.

There’s no evidence in House records that Bruce lobbied Cannon to be on the task force.

Speaker-designate Weatherford also had some picks: Rep. Dennis Baxley, R-Ocala, who sponsored the 2005 ""stand your ground"" law, and Rep. Jason Brodeur, a Republican from Sanford, where Martin was shot.

When Baxley heard Scott’s instructions, he told us that he called Weatherford and asked him to submit his name for the task force.

Brodeur didn’t ask to be on the task force. But he readily agreed to it when Weatherford called, he said.

Bondi nominated two law enforcement leaders, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings and Florida State Police Chief David Perry, to the task force a week later. She approached them, spokeswoman Jennifer Meale said. No application.

Miami-Dade State Attorney Katherine Fernandez Rundle told us she received an out-of-the-blue call about joining the committee from Carroll’s chief of staff, John Konkus.

""He said that they would like me to be on it,"" she said. ""I asked some questions about who else was on there, what was the time frame.""

She accepted his offer the next morning. ""I consider it a real duty,"" she said.

So does Gretchen Lorenzo, a crime prevention coordinator for the Fort Myers police department. She said Konkus called the department, requesting that she be placed on the task force.

""I was appointed,"" she said. ""It was a great opportunity for our city.""

Task force member Maria Newman, 64, who stopped volunteering with her neighborhood crime watch unit two years ago, tells a similar story. She said a friend on the Melbourne Police Department asked her if she wanted to be on the task force. 
""I look at it as I’m taking a journey,"" Newman said. ""Hopefully my little voice will go a long ways.""

Miami community organizer Edna Canino deflected when asked about whether she was recruited onto the task force or volunteered herself, saying ""I don’t think that’s important at this time.""

So we know several members of the task force were essentially recruited by Carroll, Cannon or Bondi. It puts a hole in Carroll’s claim that the selections were entirely based on people who ""came to us with an interest in the review.""

We did find one person to support that claim: Tampa criminal defense attorney Joe Caimano, who emailed Cannon about serving. In an email, he wrote that his experience litigating ""stand your ground"" cases would be valuable. He ended up on the task force, though we’re not sure who made the decision since Cannon only recommended Derek Bruce. 
We made a public records request for all correspondence -- including any ""applications"" -- between those interested in the task force and the governor’s office on April 19, shortly after the news conference ended. It remained unfulfilled as of May 2, although the governor's office said it would get back to us shortly.

A spokeswoman for Scott clarified Carroll’s comments on April 25, a week after the request, saying, ""There was no formal application process.""

Spokeswoman Jackie Schutz added: ""Sen. Smith never made his interest in serving on the task force known to our office."" 
Konkus also called us on May 2 to explain there were no cold calls, but that some people had been recommended without their knowledge. ""Several people had their names put forward from other voices across the state,"" he said.

Our ruling

Carroll said ""we didn’t go out asking people"" to join the task force charged with examining Florida’s ""stand your ground"" law. ""They came to us,"" she said.

This was accurate for several members, including Baxley, Siplin and Caimano (there could be more, but we can’t know that without Scott’s office fulfilling our records request).

But we found several instances of the panel’s organizers inviting people to join, including a state attorney and crime prevention coordinator personally recruited by Carroll’s top aide.  
That's not how Carroll put it at the news conference, when she spoke of an application process. We rate Carroll’s claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809713D500>],/factchecks/2012/may/03/jennifer-carroll/jennifer-carroll-apply-stand-your-ground-task-forc/

Ad says stimulus tax credits funded jobs in Finland
","
Is your tax money paying for jobs in Finland?

A TV ad running in eight states blames President Barack Obama for sending stimulus money overseas while Americans are out of work.

""Tell President Obama, American tax dollars should help American taxpayers,"" the narrator says. Instead, $2.3 billion in tax credits funded jobs in Mexico, Finland and China, the ad claims.

Americans for Prosperity, a group dedicated to ""educating citizens about economic policy"" that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad April 26, 2012.

Here’s the string of claims, starting with an image of the president signing a bill:
  
Washington promised to create American jobs. We passed their stimulus. But that's not what happened. Fact: Billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas, while millions of Americans can't find a job. $1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico. Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China. 

We rated one claim from the ad, about stimulus tax credits supposedly funding a plant in Mexico, a Pants on Fire falsehood. A second claim, on building traffic lights in China, we rated Mostly False.  In this fact-check, we’re examining if those tax credits included ""half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland.""

(We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.) 
The ad said its source for the Finland claim was an ABC News article, ""Car Company Gets U.S. Loan, Builds Cars In Finland.""

A loan for U.S. work

The first clue something’s wrong is in that ABC News headline. A car company got a ""U.S. loan."" That’s not the same thing as a tax credit. Taxpayers expect to get loan money back, with interest. (Though, they don’t always. See: Solyndra.)

Things get even more wrong from there.

That U.S. loan program? It's the Advanced Technology Vehicles Manufacturing program through the Energy Department. And it's not funded by Obama’s stimulus bill — otherwise known as the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. It is, in fact, a program signed into existence by President George W. Bush in 2007 and first funded by legislation Bush signed in 2008. 

The program was designed to support development of advanced technology vehicles.

The Bush administration was in charge when the automaker filed its application. The Obama administration was in charge when the company’s loan was approved. The stimulus bill had nothing to do with it.

Now, the ad could have raised relevant criticism of the Energy Department’s loan programs. Watchdogs inside and outside government have argued since the Bush administration that the programs haven’t included safeguards sufficient to protect taxpayers. Instead, the ad says stimulus tax credits funded overseas jobs. That’s the claim we’re weighing here. And that’s just not the case.

Fisker Automotive, a U.S. automaker with global headquarters in Anaheim, Calif., got its $529 million federal loan to develop and produce two lines of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles — the Karma and the Nina.

The project was expected to create about 2,000  jobs in Wilmington, Del., where the Nina would be manufactured, according to the Energy Department.

Part of the loan — $169 million — paid for design, engineering and other work in the United States on the Fisker Karma. A larger part — $359 million — was slated to help buy and reconfigure a shuttered General Motors plant in Delaware to build the Nina.

Here’s where Finland enters the story: Before its Energy Department loans were approved, Fisker had decided it would manufacture the Karma at a plant in Finland. The company argued there simply wasn’t a U.S. plant available for the type of car they were building. But 65 percent of the parts for the Karma, based on cost, would come from U.S. suppliers.

""There was no contract manufacturer in the U.S. that could actually produce our vehicle,"" Henrik Fisker, the company's founder, told ABC News. ""They don't exist here.""

The loan for the design of the car ""was only used for the U.S. operations"" and could not be spent overseas, according to  Fisker and the Energy Department.

Meanwhile, most of the loan has yet to be disbursed. Fisker says it stopped taking loan money from the Energy Department in May 2011, after drawing $190 million — most of it for Karma design and development. Its Nina project, now called the Atlantic, has been delayed.

The News Journal in Wilmington, Del., reported the payments to Fisker stopped after the company failed to meet Energy Department milestones set as conditions for the loan. 
""Our loan documents require borrowers to meet certain milestones and other conditions prior to receiving loan proceeds,"" department spokesman Damien LaVera told PolitiFact. ""As has been widely reported, Fisker has experienced some delays in its sales and production schedule -- which is common for start-ups. 
""As Fisker works through those issues and incorporates lessons learned from the production of the Karma, the department is working with Fisker to review a revised business plan and determine the best path forward so the company can meet its benchmarks, produce cars and employ workers here in America."" 
That makes it an open question when the Delaware plant will produce Fisker autos. As of April, it only employed a small maintenance team. In the meantime, it's not getting loan money. 
Our ruling

An ad from Americans for Prosperity starts with an image of Obama and says the stimulus bill sent tax credits overseas, such as ""half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland.""

The reality: Half a billion in loans from a Bush-era program were approved for Fisker Automotive. But they weren’t tax credits, weren’t part of the stimulus bill, and didn’t go to Finland. And so far, the company has only gotten $190 million in those loans, far less than the half a billion.

Instead, the U.S. company spent a third of the money on U.S. engineering of a new electric vehicle. It chose to manufacture the car in Finland, without U.S. help. Another two-thirds of the loan, which it may or may not get, will go toward retooling a shuttered GM plant in Delaware.  

The ad strings together disparate statements to tell a concocted story. The result is simply False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096886340>],/factchecks/2012/may/03/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-jobs-finland/
"['Ohio', 'Kevin DeWine']","
Ex-GOP chair Kevin DeWine says that on his watch the Ohio party led all state organizations in new voter contacts
","
Kevin DeWine in April lost a bitter, high-profile power struggle for control of the Ohio Republican Party to Gov. John Kasich even though DeWine was the party’s chairman. The feud between these GOP titans grew so personal that even time may not be enough to heal these battle scars, especially for DeWine.

We won’t rehash all the nastiness but in a nutshell Kasich wanted DeWine booted for his perceived lack of support when Kasich successfully ran for office in 2010 against Democratic incumbent Ted Strickland.

But DeWine did not go quietly, penning a resignation letter in which he declared himself the better man making the sake of the party his foremost concern and noting that Republicans may have just lost the best chairman they had ever had.

DeWine, who took office in January 2009, noted that he had promised to re-engage the state party’s conservative base and establish improved voter contact programs. In his letter he deemed himself a success by using the 2010 elections as a barometer when Republicans swept the statewide elected offices and more.

He then took his boasting a step further, claiming at least by one measure to be the best run state-level Republican party in the country during his tenure.

""Since 2009, the Ohio Republican Party has collected more data points — nearly 6.6 million — than any other state in the nation,"" DeWine wrote.

Data points? PolitiFact Ohio decided to learn more.

Party spokesman Chris Maloney later explained that ‘data points’ represent actual contacts with voters, whether it be by phone, door-to-door knocking, email, snail mail or through social media outlets.

Maloney would not share the party’s data for proprietary reasons, he said, but insisted the ""nearly 6.6 million"" figure that DeWine touts is accurate. As for how that ranks against other states, Maloney referred us to the state-level’s parent organization, the Republican National Committee.

RNC spokesman Ryan Mahoney sent us a statement: The Ohio GOP’s ""strong performance in 2010 combined with their efforts in 2011 give them the most voter contacts/data points since 2009. We monitor and coordinate with all of the states across the country so we can compare how all of the state parties perform.""

The RNC, however, declined to show us actual state-by-state figures, leaving us to essentially take them at their word.

Reviewing the political activity of 2010 and 2011 would lend itself to support DeWine’s assertion. In 2010, all five of Ohio’s statewide elected offices were up for grabs: governor, attorney general, auditor, treasurer and secretary of state. And leading into the election, four of those five offices were held by Democrats.

But with the state, much like the rest of the country, reeling from the effects of a recession, Republicans figured to have a strong shot at winning several of those seats and they did — winning all of them. The GOP also held onto a U.S. Senate seat that year.

Then came 2011, an off-year for elections that turned out to be anything but. There were two major referendums on the ballot last year that helped mobilize both Republicans and Democrats and drove an unusually high number of voters to the voting booths for a year when no major state or federal political races are anchoring the ballot.

Democrats worked their base to come out in overwhelming support of a referendum to overturn Senate Bill 5, a controversial collective bargaining bill. And Republicans reached into their deeply conservative roots to block provisions of the federal healthcare law they dubbed Obamacare from being implemented in Ohio. That turned out to be more a symbolic vote than anything since the U.S. Supreme Court had already decided that it would hear a case to determine if the healthcare law was constitutional.

The bottomline is that it figures to reason that Republicans — and Democrats, too, for that matter should they make a similar claim — likely had strong success in reaching out and making contact with their base of voters.

So where does that leave us with DeWine’s statement?

DeWine’s claim was that since 2009, the Ohio party has collected more contact points than any other state in the nation. He presented that point as part of a greater discussion of his successes as party leader.

While the organization is quick to boast about a claim of being the best among 50 state GOP operations, it would not offer up definitive proof to support their point.

A spokesman for the Republican National Committee didn’t offer statistics, either, but did support DeWine’s claim that Ohio’s performance for building contacts was tops since 2009. We see no reason for the national organization to label Ohio’s operation as tops compared to the other states unless that is true.

Based on that, we find DeWine’s claim is accurate. That the party declined to provide supporting data to back the specific numbers DeWine’s letter cites is additional information that helps provide clarity.

On the Truth-O-Meter, DeWine’s claim rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096B3AF40>],/factchecks/2012/may/03/kevin-dewine/ex-gop-chair-kevin-dewine-says-his-watch-ohio-part/
"['Economy', 'History', 'Texas', 'Mike Martinez']","
Mike Martinez says that Austin has always grown more expensive
","
In an interview aired April 19, 2012, Austin City Council Member Mike Martinez was asked by Matt Largey of Austin’s KUT, 90.5 FM whether the council could do more to make Austin affordable. Yes, Martinez replied, adding a beat later: ""Over the history of Austin, it’s always gotten more expensive. And that’s not going to change.""

Martinez continued: ""What we do as a council is to try to manage that economic growth to where it doesn’t negatively impact our residents as much as it could. If we didn’t involve ourselves, if we didn’t insert ourselves, I dare say it would be a whole lot worse.""

Setting aside the council’s role and impact, has Austin always gotten more expensive?

Of course, Martinez told us in a telephone interview. Saying he’s been an Austin resident since 1988, Martinez said that gas prices, property values, property taxes and utility costs have all gone up. He added: ""I don’t think you need to do a study. You’re not paying the same price for a gallon of milk that you paid 20 years ago."" (Wise-guy response: You are if you don’t drink milk.)

""Always"" is a powerful characterization; Austin was established in 1839. And Martinez did not provide, nor did we find, information specifically showing Austin growing more expensive every year through history.

Seeking the long view, we queried David C. Humphrey, who wrote the entry for Austin in the Handbook of Texas Online. He replied by email: ""Over the years, Austin's economy has had its downs as well as its ups. In the latter 1980s, for example, starting in 1986, housing  prices tumbled and Austin's office vacancy rate jumped to No. 1 in the nation... Austin's economy took a few years to recover but was sizzling again by the mid-1990s. The early 1930s, during the Great Depression, were certainly hard economic times for many Austinites. Wages and salaries fell (UT faculty members took a 25 percent pay cut), and unemployment grew acute, though Austin's economy held up better than that of many other towns and cities.""

Humphrey, summing up, said Austin prices haven’t always been on the rise, though prices have trended upward in recent years.

We’ve poked into Austin’s affordability before, rating Mostly False a 2011 claim that Austin had lately experienced the highest cost of living of any large Texas city. At the time, we considered a composite cost-of-living index managed by the Virginia-based Council for Community and Economic Research. The council’s index is based on the costs of housing, utilities, grocery items, transportation, health care and miscellaneous goods and services, but it does not weigh the effect of property taxes, which is substantial in Texas.

The index enables comparisons of the cost of living between cities at any given time but does not lend itself to gauging changes in a city over time, council spokesman Dean Frutiger recently told us.

Frutiger forwarded Austin’s index for the first quarter of 1991 through 2011. In eight of those years, the index suggests, Austin’s cost of living was lower than the national average. In the first quarter of 1994, 1997 and 2004, Austin’s cost of living exceeded the national average.

Mindful that Martinez spoke about Austin’s cost of living in itself, we turned next to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, which tracks the Consumer Price Index, the government measure of the average change over time in the prices of consumer items — goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living.

James Howard, a Dallas-based bureau economist, told us by telephone that Austin is not among southern cities where prices are routinely checked by field staff. However, the bureau’s index research for some metropolitan areas of 150,000 to 1.5 million in population since 2002 included checks of prices in San Antonio, Beaumont-Port Arthur, Brownsville-Harlingen-San Benito, Amarillo and Midland-Odessa. And according to that research, the CPI-U -- that is, the index for urban consumers -- went up nearly every year from 2002 to 2012, with the bumps ranging from 1.1 percent, in 2002, to 4.7 percent, in 2008. The index dropped slightly in one year, 2009, by 0.4 percent. It then increased 1.8 percent in 2010.

Howard pointed out older bureau research for similar cities indicating that the CPI-U escalated every year from 1977 through 1997.

Other experts pointed out other ways of gauging changes in Austin’s cost of living.

Beverly Kerr, vice president for research at the Greater Austin Area Chamber of Commerce, applied a version of the CPI-U to average home prices as calculated by the Real Estate Center at Texas A&M University. Based on 2011 dollars, Austin’s average 2011 home price of $251,600 was higher, by about $100,000, than Austin’s average 1990 home price of $149,762.

Again calculated in 2011 dollars, the average home price dropped in six of the 21 years between 1990 and 2012, Kerr’s calculation suggests — in 2001, 2003, 2004, 2008, 2009 and 2011. The biggest drop was $13,095 from 2007 to 2008, when the average home price was $253,787.

Wondering about apartment rents, we checked with Dallas-based Laura Williams of ALN Apartment Data Inc. who guided us to its graph indicating that rents paid by Austin residents steadily climbed from late 2005 to early 2008, then dropped off to 2010 before mostly increasing to 2012. Separately, Kerr guided us to Hendricks & Partners, whose Austin spokesman, George Deuillet, told us average rents in Austin increased all but one year from 2006 through 2011, dropping 3.5 percent in 2009. 
A little more: Robin Davis of Austin Investor Interests, which has a website tracking apartment trends, told us that local apartment rents dropped from 2001 to 2004 before gradually climbing through 2008, dipping in 2009 and subsequently climbing.

We recognized one more aspect to gauging how expensive Austin has been during a telephone interview of Bruce Kellison, associate director of the University of Texas Bureau of Business Research, IC² (Innovation, Creativity, Capital) Institute. Kellison counseled that any analysis of changes in the cost of living should try to account for wage changes. It’s possible, he said, that while prices increased, wages outpaced them.

We asked Austin economist Stuart Greenfield to assess how average wages have tracked with the cost of living. Greenfield, drawing on information from state and federal agencies, said unadjusted annual pay in Travis County, which includes Austin, increased about 24 percent from 2001 through 2010, narrowly outpacing inflation which ranged from 23 to nearly 24 percent, according to different versions of the CPI. Put another way, he said, real annual pay increased about 1 percent -- a smidge.

And does this suggest that life in Austin grew a little less expensive? On average, Greenfield replied, ""one’s well-being improved"" slightly.

Nudged before we finished this research, an Austin consultant to Martinez, Mark Littlefield, pointed out that by the calculations of the the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, the CPI was far greater in 2012 than it would have been at Austin’s founding. ""There have been years of nominal decreases, like during the Great Depression, but over time things have obviously ‘gotten more expensive’ in Austin,"" Littlefield said by email.

According to the bank’s calculation, though, the CPI stayed the same or decreased in about 70 of the years from 1840 through 1955. After that, it dropped in one year, 2009, by 0.4 percent.

Our ruling

In some ways, Austin has grown more expensive of late. Yet rents dipped in some years. And the area’s average annual pay outpaced inflation over a recent decade. Also, while we did not come up with precise pre-1990s information, it's reasonable to speculate that periods of economic difficulty through history included decreases in Austin's cost of living.

This claim has a nowadays’ ring of truth, but its ""always"" element disregards times when costs dropped. We rate Martinez’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097746D00>],/factchecks/2012/may/03/mike-martinez/mike-martinez-says-austin-has-always-grown-more-ex/
"['New Jersey', 'Crime', 'Women', 'Guns', 'Frank Lautenberg']","
Frank Lautenberg claims a loophole allows individuals convicted of domestic violence to purchase guns
","
U.S. Sen. Frank Lautenberg pushed through a law 15 years ago that prohibits people convicted of domestic violence from acquiring a gun. But the Democrat said there’s still avenues for those individuals to arm themselves.

Lautenberg spoke April 26 on the Senate floor in favor of reauthorizing legislation that supports efforts to help victims of domestic violence and sexual abuse. During his speech, he said even more needs to be done in this area.

""Let me be clear. It would be tragic to turn our backs on victims and the people who dedicate their lives to supporting them. While we can’t stop all malicious acts, we can do more to keep women and their families safe,"" Lautenberg said. ""In 1996, I wrote the domestic violence gun ban, [which] forbids anyone convicted of domestic violence from getting a gun. Since the law's inception, we have kept guns from falling into violent hands on over 200,000 occasions. For instance, in our gun laws we’re allowing domestic abusers to sidestep this ban on getting a gun. The loophole allows a convicted abuser to walk into a gun show and walk out with a gun, no questions asked.""

PolitiFact New Jersey wondered if it’s that simple for someone who, under federal law isn’t allowed to have a gun, to buy one.

""Yes,"" said James Jacobs, director of the Center for Research in Crime and Justice at New York University School of Law, it’s ""that simple.""

Lautenberg was describing what is commonly known as the ""gun show loophole."" The Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, or Brady Act, requires all federally licensed firearms dealers to run a background check on potential customers to ensure they are not prohibited from owning a gun.

But private sellers without a federal license don’t have to meet the same requirement. Though this exception is known as the ""gun show loophole,"" unlicensed individuals don’t have to perform background checks whether they are selling a gun at a gun show or somewhere else.

""Of course, a prohibited possessor can also buy from a private party outside of a gun show with no paperwork or background check,"" said Gabriel Chin, professor of law at the University of California at Davis School of Law. ""But the trick is that many of the private sellers at gun shows are really unlicensed full time dealers, so they may be selling scores or hundreds of guns a year with no paperwork.  Because of the volume, they are much more reliable sources of firearms for prohibited possessors.""

As a result of the loophole, ""it’s possible a convicted felon could go into a gun show and buy a firearm without ever being checked,"" said Chris Bombardiere, public information officer at the Newark Field Division of the  Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives.

That isn’t possible everywhere, however, since some states have passed more restrictive gun laws. According to the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence, 17 states, including New Jersey, ""have either closed the gun show loophole or have taken action to close the loophole.""

Our ruling

Lautenberg said that ""in our gun laws we’re allowing domestic abusers to sidestep this ban on getting a gun. The loophole allows a convicted abuser to walk into a gun show and walk out with a gun, no questions asked.""

That statement is true because federal law does not require individuals who are not federally licensed to perform background checks before a gun transaction, whether they are at a gun show or not.

Though laws can vary state to state and some states have passed laws that have essentially closed that loophole, this does not diminish Lautenberg’s statement. He was speaking on the Senate floor about federal law.

We rate the statement True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Education', 'State Budget', 'David Dooley']","
University of Rhode Island president David Dooley says that average salaries at URI are the second-lowest among New England’s state universities
","
When Governor Chafee objected to 3-percent raises for faculty at the University of Rhode Island and other state colleges last month, his action raised questions about how much professors are paid for their work.

In an appearance last month on ""10 News Conference,"" URI President David Dooley was asked about the controversy.

""We have to recognize that our salaries for faculty are the lowest in New England with the exception of the University of Maine,"" he said on the show, which aired April 8. ""That’s a competitive disadvantage for us in the national and international hunt for talent. Our students will not be as successful if we don’t have the best and brightest in those classrooms.""

We wondered whether URI’s salaries are really that low relative to other public higher education institutions. If they are, Dooley’s contention that the salaries make URI less attractive to prospective faculty members makes sense.

While waiting for the university’s media relations department to get back to us on the source of Dooley’s claim, we searched for information and data.


The Chronicle of Higher Education, a news source about colleges and universities, maintains a salary database on its website based on annual surveys by the American Association of University Professors, a nonprofit organization based in Washington, D.C.

The AAUP’s most recent survey, for the 2011-12 fiscal year, collected salary information for 1,251 higher education institutions around the country. The survey broke down the average salaries by position: full professor, associate professor, assistant professor, and, where applicable, instructor.

According to the survey, the national average for full professors is $113,176; for associate professors, it’s $78,565; for assistant professors, $66,564; and instructors, $47,847.

At the University of Rhode Island, the average for full professors is $105,200; for associate professors, it’s $78,900; for assistant professors, the number is $65,800; and for instructors, it’s $58,600.

To be clear, in his statement, Dooley was comparing URI with the other flagship state universities in New England. This is a small group that excludes private institutions and smaller public colleges, such as Rhode Island College and the Community College of Rhode Island.

Besides URI, the list includes the University of Connecticut, the University of Massachusetts system, the University of New Hampshire, the University of Vermont and the University of Maine.

According to the Chronicle database, UConn, the four UMass campuses and the University of Vermont all had higher average salaries for each teaching level than URI. The University of Maine’s average salaries were all lower.

Data for the University of New Hampshire was missing from the 2011-12 survey. A spokeswoman for the AAUP told us UNH did not respond to a request for salary information. 

When we called UNH, a spokeswoman said the faculty union may not have provided the information because it’s in the midst of a contract dispute with the university and is working under the terms of an expired contract. Erika Mantz, director of media relations, gave us the current average salaries for UNH faculty.

In summary, these are the average salaries for full professors at each institution in order from highest to lowest: UConn ($139,100), UMass Amherst ($122,600), UMass Lowell ($120,100), UNH ($115,800), UMass Boston ($115,700), UMass Dartmouth ($111,200), the University of Vermont ($113,800), URI ($105,200) and the University of Maine ($95,000). 

So URI does indeed rank second from the bottom in the region. And for each of the other categories, it occupies the same place.

When David Lavallee, a spokesman for URI, got back to us, he provided data that the provost’s office took from the 2010-11 AAUP salary survey. We confirmed that in that year, URI also had the second-lowest average salaries in New England.

Our ruling

Dooley said that faculty salaries at URI are the lowest among public universities in New England except for the University of Maine. According to a national survey, he’s correct.

Moreover, although salaries for lower-level faculty at URI are comparable to national averages or better, salaries for full professors are 7 percent lower than the national average.

We rate Dooley’s statement True.

DCCC says Allen West wants to bring earmarks back
","
You’ve probably heard of the earmark to build the bridge to nowhere in Alaska.

But what about tariff breaks for those who make snow globes? Or yard ornaments depicting school mascots? Or men’s shoes?

Not just any shoes, but to be precise: ""certain men's footwear covering the ankle, the height of which from the bottom of the outer sole to the top of the upper exceeds 19 cm, with waterproof molded soles, valued at more than $30 per pair.’’

Those are all items that lawmakers in Washington sought to designate as worthy of a tariff break for companies in 2009-2010.

U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Plantation, was one of 65 freshmen Republicans who signed an April 20 letter calling for support of the ""miscellaneous tariff bill’’ which would reward these breaks. (Other Florida members who signed included Rep. David Rivera, R-Miami, and Rep. Steve Southerland, R-Panama City.)   
After POLITICO wrote about the tariffs and their similarity to earmarks, which are currently banned, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee blasted out an email:

""According to Politico, Representative Allen West (FL-22) has been caught ‘begging’ Republican leaders to bring back earmarks. West signed a letter in support of earmarks ‘even though it runs counter to the earmark ban Republicans campaigned on in 2010 and instituted when they took power.' ""

Does West calling for the tariff breaks mean he wants to bring back earmarks?

What’s a miscellaneous tariff bill?

To begin at the beginning: American companies import materials to make everything from umbrellas to medicines to pianos. The importers of these raw materials have to pay federal tariffs. And every year, hundreds of American companies, often with the help of lobbyists, ask members of Congress to suspend those tariffs. Supporters say waivers allow them to keep prices lower and employ more Americans.

Members introduce the requests as individual bills, which go through committees and then are vetted by the International Trade Commission and other agencies. The bills must meet certain criteria, including a limit on the loss of tariff revenue to under $500,000 per year.

(The Washington Post found that lawmakers circumvent that dollar limit by filing multiple bills. In 2005, a Massachusetts representative filed six different bills changing the wording slightly to cover leather basketballs, rubber basketballs, etc.)

The International Trade Commission posts the requests with explanations of the products. For example, here's an explanation about those snow globes, requested by Sen. Max Baucus, D-Mont., on behalf of a company in Missoula: ""A snow globe is filled with plastic flakes (or metallic glitter) in an aqueous liquid. ... Shaking or inverting the snow globe stirs up the plastic flakes that settle slowly in the liquid when the globe is set upright, thus creating the effect of snow fall upon the figurine, object, or scenery inside.""

Members had until April 30, 2012, to submit requests. The bills probably won’t reach the chambers for votes until fall.

West didn’t submit any requests, said his chief of staff Jonathan Blyth on the deadline day.

At least one South Florida lawmaker did, though. Rep. Ted Deutch, D-Boca Raton, filed one for certain coffee brewers with ""milk frothing capacity"" and another for electromechanical ice shavers.

Is it an earmark?

The DCCC -- and some Republicans -- say tariff breaks are equivalent to bringing back earmarks.

Back in 2010, the House Republican Conference adopted a rule stating members couldn’t request earmarks or limited tariff benefits. A limited tariff benefit is defined as benefiting less than 10 companies.

Today, lawmakers introducing miscellaneous tariff bills say they could apply to any company. But it’s not clear that’s always the case, since some of the bills seem quite specific.

West’s office pointed us to this myths vs. facts page distributed by the House Ways and Means Committee. In the fact sheet, the Republicans argued that earmarks increase spending, but tariff bills reduce tariffs and are equivalent to a tax cut. They also said the tariff waivers could apply to any company and that the process is a ""model of transparency.""

There is some feuding in the ranks about whether they are earmarks and about how they're handled.

Sen. Jim DeMint, R-S.C., has teamed up with Sen. Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to propose changing the process so businesses go directly to the trade commission to seek the tariff break. Lawmakers would still have to vote on it, but they wouldn’t have the chance to pick and choose which ones to forward to the commission. DeMint argues that would get rid of the ""pay-to-play racket.""

""Some want to restart this part of the political favor factory and hope Americans don't notice Republicans breaking their own earmark ban, and others want to redefine earmarks to create a loophole for tariff suspensions,"" DeMint wrote in an op-ed for CNN.com.

Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that monitors earmarking and other budget issues, has raised concerns about the tariff bills because of the ""potential pay-to-play and special interest giveaways that it perpetuates,"" said vice president Steve Ellis in a recent email.

""So call them earmarks, call them limited tariff benefits, call them whatever you like, we are still concerned with this legislation,"" he said.

Ellis said he will analyze this year's list to determine if some raise the same concerns as earmarks -- such as benefiting few people who are giving campaign donations to their members in Congress.

So would Ellis call them earmarks?

""I’m going to wait and see,"" he said. ""I wouldn’t be surprised if some of them are.""

Our ruling

The DCCC said that West’s signature on a letter with dozens of House Republicans calling for a miscellaneous tariff bill means that he wants to bring earmarks back. 
Tariff breaks do raise some of the same concerns as earmarks. Business owners who can help fund candidates’ campaigns seek the financial benefit from their own representatives.  And some of the bills are written in such a way as to only benefit a select few. 
But the process and the particulars involved in earmarks vs. tariff breaks are very different. Earmarks direct spending; tariff bills are more like tax breaks. More importantly, the process for tariff breaks is transparent and relatively easy to track, unlike the earmarks of previous years.

Ad says stimulus tax credits funded a solar company building a Mexico plant
","
A TV ad running in eight states blames President Barack Obama for sending stimulus money overseas while Americans are out of work.

""Tell President Obama, American tax dollars should help American taxpayers,"" the narrator says. Instead, $2.3 billion in tax credits funded jobs in Mexico, Finland and China, the ad claims.

We checked all three examples — and found the ad incorrectly describes them all. 

(We've also checked many other exaggerations about the stimulus.)

Americans for Prosperity, a group dedicated to ""educating citizens about economic policy"" that works closely with tea party activists and has been funded by the conservative Koch family, released the ad April 26, 2012.

Here’s the string of claims, starting with an image of the president signing a bill: 
Washington promised to create American jobs. We passed their stimulus. But that's not what happened. Fact: Billions of taxpayer dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. The Obama administration admitted the truth, that $2.3 billion of tax credits went overseas, while millions of Americans can't find a job. $1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico. Half a billion to an electric car company that created hundreds of jobs in Finland. And tens of millions of dollars to build traffic lights in China. 
Sounds like a scandal and an outrage. Is that what happened? 
For this fact-check, we’re focusing on whether ""tax credits"" that ""went overseas"" included ""$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico."" (In other fact-checks, we found the Finland claim False, and the China claim Mostly False.)

The ad listed two sources for its Mexico claim, the Energy Department and PV Magazine. We tracked those down, then chatted with the companies involved.

Two programs, two projects

We’ll start with what’s true: An American solar company, SunPower, was approved for federal stimulus money. It also opened a solar panel plant in Mexico.

(Or, rather, it moved its Mexican manufacturing from Chihuahua to a building it’s leasing in Mexicali, said company spokeswoman Natalie Wymer.)

That’s where the claim’s relationship to the truth ends.

• The company didn’t get tax credits, but a $1.2 billion loan guarantee. What’s the difference? The Energy Department expects the loan to be paid back — with interest.

• That loan guarantee wasn’t for the Mexico plant — a separate project with its own funding — but to build the California Valley Solar Ranch in San Luis Obispo, Calif. Construction on the California project has already started, with the Energy Department projecting 350 construction jobs and 15 permanent ones. Pacific Gas & Electric Co., the state’s largest utility, will ultimately buy the power.

• Most of the solar panels for the California project will come from SunPower’s California manufacturing facility in Milpitas, though given the size of the project, they’ll also come from the company’s plants in Mexico and Asia, Wymer said.

• SunPower no longer owns the California Valley Solar Ranch project. The solar project — and the loan guarantee — belong to New Jersey company NRG Energy. That’s the company that will get the federal loan money, and be responsible for repaying taxpayers.

Our ruling

A TV ad from Americans for Prosperity says billions of tax dollars spent on green energy went to jobs in foreign countries. It claims that stimulus bill tax credits went overseas, such as ""$1.2 billion to a solar company that's building a plant in Mexico."" The ad even cites sources for its claim.

But those same sources, plus a few phone calls, quickly bring down the ad’s house of cards. Sure, taxpayer money was originally approved for a California solar company that also happened to open a plant in Mexico. But that loan — not tax credits, as the ad claims — will go to a New Jersey company for a solar project in California, employing construction workers in the state, using mostly California-built solar panels, to create solar power that’ll be purchased by a California utility.

That’s a completely different story. The ad strings together alarming-sounding tidbits about actual stimulus projects to create the impression of something else entirely — in a way that’s ultimately ridiculous. And that earns our lowest rating, Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975B99C0>],/factchecks/2012/may/02/americans-prosperity/ad-says-stimulus-tax-credits-funded-solar-company-/

Gubernatorial hopeful Kathleen Falk says women in Wisconsin paid 81 cents compared to $1 for males for doing 'the same job'
","
Continuing to accuse Gov. Scott Walker of waging a ""war on women,"" Democratic gubernatorial candidate Kathleen Falk posted a YouTube video that highlights her opposition to the repeal of a workplace discrimination law.

Walker’s signature on a Republican-backed bill repealed the right of discriminated workers to sue in state court for compensatory and punitive damages.

Asked why the right to sue in state court was needed, Falk told the Oshkosh Northwestern newspaper on April 17, 2012 it was because Wisconsin women ""are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job.""

The key phrase here, which Falk also used in a speech three weeks earlier, is same job.

Is she right?

We’ve done several items related to the 2009 law, passed when Democrats controlled state government,  and its April 2012 repeal three times.

Most recently, we gave Falk a False for saying the repeal left women with no options to fight pay discrimination (They could still pursue the claims through other avenues, including federal court) and Walker a Mostly False for saying the old law was ""kind of a gravy train"" for lawyers (no lawsuits had been filed while it was in place).

When we asked Falk campaign spokesman Scot Ross for evidence to back the 81 cents vs. $1 claim, he cited an April 2012 report by the Center on Wisconsin Strategy think tank and the Wisconsin Women’s Council, a state government board that advocates for women.

The report says that in 2009, Wisconsin women earned, on average, 81 cents for every dollar earned by men.

That’s the same figure Falk cited -- but it measures something quite different.

Falk said Wisconsin women earn 81 cents for every dollar earned by men for ""doing the same job.""

What the report says is that -- considering all Wisconsin women and men in the workforce working all sorts of jobs -- women earn 81 cents for every dollar men earn.

The report underlines that point by saying that one reason Wisconsin women earn less than men on average is they are concentrated in occupations that pay lower wages, including in retail, services, education, nonprofits and health care.

Laura Dresser, associate director of the Center on Wisconsin Strategy, confirmed that the report does not say what Falk said it did.

We could say case closed, but we wondered whether there are statistics measuring the pay of Wisconsin men and women who work in the same job.

Dresser said she didn’t know of any such studies, but suggested we contact the Institute for Women’s Policy Research, a Washington, D.C. think tank. The institute provided us an April 2011 report it did on women in Wisconsin.

The D.C. think tank examined a slightly different population -- adults who worked full time year round in 2009. Its report found that Wisconsin women earned 75 cents for every dollar earned by men.

But, again, that figure is for all occupations, not women and men working in the same job; and the D.C. think tank, like the Wisconsin groups in their report, noted that women tended to work in lesser-paying occupations.

We did find evidence on the national level that women tend to be paid less than men in many occupations.

According to the D.C. institute, among 111 occupations for which weekly median wage data could be estimated for 2010, men earned more than women in all but four occupations.

The largest gap was among personal financial advisors, with women on average earning 58 cents for every $1 earned by men.

But in relation to Falk’s claim, those figures are national and apply to types of occupations, not to men and working the same job.

Our rating

Falk said Wisconsin women ""are paid 81 cents to the dollar of a man doing the same job."" To be sure, as a group women are paid less than men and they are in many individual instances.

But she misquoted the report she relied on.

What the report said is that, among all working men and women in Wisconsin working all sorts of jobs, women earn 81 cents for every dollar earned by men.

We rate Falk’s ""same job"" statement False.

"['New Jersey', 'Jobs', 'Barbara Buono']","
With Chris Christie to campaign for Scott Walker, a New Jersey state senator claimed Wisconsin led the nation in job losses over the past year
","
With Gov. Chris Christie heading west to campaign for Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, state Sen. Barbara Buono took a moment this week to inform New Jerseyans that the Badger State is leading the nation -- in job losses.

A little more than a year after signing a bill restricting collective bargaining rights for most public employees -- legislation that set off massive protests and attracted national media attention -- Walker is facing a recall election on June 5. The primary for the recall election is next Tuesday.

As Christie prepared to visit Wisconsin the next day, Buono, a Democrat representing part of Middlesex County, issued a news release on Monday criticizing the two Republican governors.

""Our governor seems more concerned with one man’s job in Wisconsin than the legions of unemployed constituents at home,"" Buono said in the news release. ""It’s not as if Scott Walker has any advice to offer. Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state.""

PolitiFact New Jersey discovered that Buono’s statistic is on target. From March 2011 to March 2012, Wisconsin lost more jobs than any other state, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Here’s how the labor figures break down.

We normally analyze job growth in both ""net"" terms -- the actual number of jobs lost or gained -- and ""percentage"" terms.

By both measures, Wisconsin finished in last place for over-the-year employment changes -- driven in large part by the loss of government jobs.

In March 2012, Wisconsin had 2,730,600 jobs, representing a loss of 23,900 jobs, or 0.9 percent, since March 2011. The state’s net loss of jobs far surpassed the next highest amount of 3,500 jobs lost in Mississippi. The March 2012 figures are preliminary and subject to change.

Nearly 75 percent of the jobs lost in Wisconsin during the past year occurred in the public sector, which accounted for 17,800 of the job losses.

Steven Deller, a professor of Agricultural and Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, argued that the political dynamics in the state has negatively impacted the business climate.

""In addition to the massive budget cuts at the state and local level the political dynamics has cast a black cloud over the business climate of the state,"" Deller told us in an e-mail. ""People/businesses are starting to say ‘stop the political war and work together’. This is independent of party affiliation.""

In case you’re wondering how job growth in New Jersey compares with the rest of the nation, here are the Garden State’s statistics:

From March 2011 to March 2012, New Jersey gained 38,300 jobs for an increase of 1 percent. That growth represents increases of 35,200 private-sector jobs and 3,100 public-sector jobs.

For total employment changes among all 50 states, New Jersey ranked 15th in net terms and 24th in percentage terms.

Our ruling

In a news release issued Monday, Buono offered this statistic about the Badger State: ""Wisconsin lost more jobs over the past 12 months than any other state.""

According to federal labor statistics, Buono’s claim is accurate. From March 2011 to March 2012, Wisconsin lost 23,900 jobs, or 0.9 percent, placing the state in last place for both measures.

We rate the statement True.

"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Energy', 'Sherrod Brown']","
Sherrod Brown says excessive oil speculation is driving gas prices, perhaps by 56 cents a gallon
","
When it costs more than $70 to fill up a tank with gas, average Americans are left wondering why?

Sen. Sherrod Brown says Wall Street oil speculation is partly to blame and recently called for the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to intervene.

""We’re seeing gas prices rise long before the peak summer driving season — and excessive oil speculation is a key source of these cost spikes,"" Brown said in a news release. ""In fact, one recent report showed that out-of-control speculation adds 56 cents to every gallon of gasoline siphoned from the pump — and that’s outrageous.""

Is there such a thing as excessive oil speculation? Does it really boost the pump price of gas by 56 cents? PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

First, a word about speculation in general. All agree that a certain amount in commodities markets is a good thing. Here’s why.

Take a soybean farmer. To ensure that he makes a certain amount of money on his crop, he will enter into futures contracts that guarantee a price at harvest time. It’s called hedging. Soybean buyers may enter into similar contracts to protect their interests. In both cases, hedging eliminates the chance of devastating, unforeseen price swings.

Speculators, unlike the industry hedgers, never intend to deliver or receive anything. They make their money by correctly guessing the direction the price will go. But to ensure hedgers have plenty of options, the market needs speculators to provide an ample number of buyers and sellers.

A rule of thumb is that an optimal commodity market needs 70 percent natural hedgers and 30 percent speculators, said Michael Greenberger, a law professor at the University of Maryland and former director of the division of trading and markets at the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.

But today, there are more than twice as many financial speculators in the oil markets as there are hedgers, he said, and consequently the spot price of oil has become ""unmoored"" from actual supply and demand fundamentals.

The spot price is what someone pays today for immediate delivery of a commodity.

In March 2011 report, Goldman Sachs analysts wrote that unrest in the Middle East and the possibility of disruptions to the oil supply added a $10 per barrel ""risk premium"" to the price of crude oil.

Fast forward to this February. Forbes writer Robert Lenzner blogged that if not for speculators, oil would trade at just under $75 a barrel instead of the $108 price at the time.

He came to that conclusion using Goldman’s analysis that every 100 million barrels of speculative oil futures adds $10 to the barrel price. After determining that the futures market had 233.9 million barrels of oil under contract by hedge funds and other financial investors, Lenzner concluded that the market was experiencing a price premium of $23.39 per barrel.

Extrapolating further, Lenzner said that every $10 increase in a barrel of crude adds 24 cents to the pump price for gasoline. So an increase of $23.39 means the pump price theoretically was up 56 cents.

In March 2012, a commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission fanned the flames of excessive speculation even more by reiterating the same 56-cent claim.

""Now, before some of you who have an opposing view about speculation get too worked up, let me say unequivocally that markets need speculators,"" said CFTC Commissioner Bart Chilton in a speech in New York. ""But like a lot of good things, too much can be problematic. Therefore, it is the excessive speculation that can cause problems, contort markets, and result in consumers and businesses paying an unfair price.""

Chilton drove home his point by citing an even more severe price swing in 2008, when a barrel of oil topped $147 in June before plummeting to about $30 in December.

""There was no justification for such a price swing based upon the fundamentals of supply and demand,"" Chilton said. ""The only good explanation is what many researchers and prominent economists and others have said about the link to excessive speculation.""

We mention Lenzner and Chilton because Brown’s office cited their comments as support for Brown’s claim.

So, is Brown right?

Many studies ""have concluded that the five year volatility in the price of crude oil is substantially due to excessive speculation in crude oil derivative markets,"" Greenberger testified April 4 before the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee of the House of Representatives.

This excessive speculation sends a false demand signal in the futures market that makes its way to the spot oil market and drives up prices, Greenberger said. In some cases, the speculators respond by purchasing oil on the spot market and holding on to it as prices go up.

But a number of very smart people also believe speculation is being unfairly blamed.

If the futures market was really dictating the spot price of oil then oil inventories would rise accordingly, but that hasn’t happened, said Nick Loris, an energy policy analyst at the conservative Heritage Foundation.

""What you’ve seen is relatively tight markets,"" he said. Asia has surpassed North America as the leading consumer of oil. Since oil is a global commodity, the price in the United States is affected by supply and demand elsewhere in the world.

Blake Clayton, an energy fellow at the non-partisan Council on Foreign Relations, attributes ""extraordinarily high"" gas prices in the United States to ""a global market facing serious strain and historic uncertainty.""

He points to the natural gas market, where speculators account for 60 percent of the futures market.

""Thanks to new drilling techniques such as hydraulic fracturing, the United States is swimming in natural gas, and a glutted market has sent prices plummeting,"" he wrote. ""Speculative traders who recognized that the market was imbalanced have enabled, not prevented, this drop in prices.""

Lutz Kilian, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, co-authored a report that states the evidence does not suggest speculation has played an ""important role"" in the spot price of oil since 2003.

""Instead, there is strong evidence that the co-movement between spot and futures prices reflects common economic fundamentals rather than the financialization of oil futures markets.""  

To give you an idea of just how hard it is for many economists to get their head around the issue of speculation, consider what liberal economist and Nobel Prize winner Paul Krugman has had to say.

In a 2008 blog post entitled ""Speculative nonsense, once again,"" he said futures contracts have ""no, zero, nada direct effect on the spot price,"" regardless of how many investors there are and how much they bet.

But the following year he reversed his position.

""Last year I was skeptical about claims that speculation was central to the price rise, because what I considered the essential signature of a speculative price rise — physical withholding of oil from the market, in the form of high inventories — just wasn’t showing,"" Krugman wrote. ""This time, however, oil inventories are bulging, with huge amounts held in offshore tankers as well as in conventional storage. So this time there’s no question: speculation has been driving prices up.""

For the last word, we turn to the non-partisan Congressional Research Service.

""Although the relationship between speculation and commodity prices has been studied extensively, consensus has not emerged as to whether speculative trading causes unusual oil price volatility,"" it states in a recent report.

So where does that leave Brown’s claim?

There is general agreement among leading experts that speculation does exist and that it could impact prices. No less an authority than Krugman, the Nobel Prize winning economist, agrees with Brown’s basic premise. And Brown correctly cited figures from one source that estimates the impact could be as much as 56-cents a gallon.

Lenzner, who made the 56-cent estimate, didn’t used the term excessive or out-of-control and his assessment seemed more like a theoretical, back-of-the-napkin calculation than empirical evidence intended to shape policy.

And as is often the case with a subject as complex as the economy, different minds can differ. Other experts and the non-partisan Congressional Research Service aren’t as convinced that speculative trading is the culprit for today’s prices at the pump. And even Goldman Sachs has weighed back into the debate.

After CFTC Commissioner Chilton referenced the 56-cent claim, Goldman Sachs issued a statement from its analysts that seemed to suggest they were taken out of context.

""To say that ‘speculation’ is contributing to higher oil prices is no different than to say that oil prices are rising on the expectation that the improving world economic outlook will lead to more oil demand and that tensions with Iran could lead to a disruption in crude oil supplies,"" the statement said.

So while there is some consensus that speculation can impact price and there are supporters of Brown’s claim out there, it’s important to know that the full impact of speculation is not a settled proposition. Brown correctly cited one report for the his 56-cent figure. But that others say that factors beyond just speculative trading are at work is additional information that helps provide clarification.

On the Truth-O-Meter, his claim rates Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097CF4D40>],/factchecks/2012/may/02/sherrod-brown/sherrod-brown-says-excessive-oil-speculation-drivi/
"['Georgia', 'Health Care', 'Military', 'Saxby Chambliss']","
Senator says military health care costs going higher and higher
","
U.S. Sen. Saxby Chambliss has been going around the Atlanta region in recent weeks talking about the dangerous consequences of the federal government’s inability to rein in spending.

One area of spending that has the Georgia Republican concerned is the U.S. Defense Department’s health care budget. We thought one claim by the senator was a case for the Truth-O-Meter.

In an April 11 speech to the Marietta Rotary Club, The Marietta Daily Journal paraphrased Chambliss as saying health care costs are the fastest-rising expense in the Defense Department.

""If we’re not careful, it’s going to consume our ability to buy weapons systems and to pay our men and women at the rate we need to pay them,"" Chambliss told the crowd in Marietta.

Chambliss, who serves on the Senate’s Armed Services Committee, made a similar point in an April 23 speech at the Atlanta Press Club.

""If I went around this room to every company represented here and I asked you what is the fastest-rising expense in your business over the last decade, I dare say 100 percent of you would say it’s health care costs,"" Chambliss said. ""And it’s exactly that way in the federal government, including TRICARE in the Department of Defense, which is taking away our ability to spend money on other quality-of-life issues and identify weapons systems to equip our men and women.""

TRICARE is the program that provides health care to active-duty service members.

Since defense is such an important part of the duties of the federal government, PolitiFact Georgia decided to examine whether the senator was correct.

Bronwyn Lance Chester, a spokeswoman for Chambliss, sent us several newspaper articles and other documents to back up the senator’s claim. She did not specify the time period to which Chambliss was referring. That left us to our own interpretation.

The Military Health System budget, which pays for care for nearly 10 million military members, their families, retirees, dependent survivors and some others, nearly tripled over the past decade, Defense Department officials say in their budget overview, released in February. According to the overview, spending rose from $19 billion in fiscal year 2001 to the 2012 fiscal year total of about $53 billion. That $53 billion total does not include health care costs for military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan.

The federal budget year begins Oct. 1 and ends Sept. 30. We’re currently in fiscal year 2012.

Multiple news accounts quote former Defense Secretary Robert Gates and other military officials as saying health care is the fastest-growing cost of the department budget. We saw nothing in that report that shows a larger increase in any department.

PolitiFact Georgia also looked at the latest Defense Department budget, which was completed in March. Lance Chester referred us to Table 5-5 of the budget, known as the Green Book, which has a breakdown of spending in several categories dating back to 1970 and projected through fiscal year 2017, which would begin Oct. 1, 2016.

We began by looking at the last five years. Here, the numbers were higher than what we saw in the February report. The current fiscal year spending under the health category was $100 billion. In fiscal year 2008, it was $82.74 billion. By our calculations, that was nearly a 21 percent increase over that five-year time span. That was the largest increase we saw. The second-highest increase was in fuel, which rose by 19.6 percent.

In fiscal year 2017, the health portion of the Defense Department budget is projected to be $114.24 billion. Other medical costs rose by a similar percentage.

Maya MacGuineas, president of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, an organization of former federal budget officials, members of Congress and experts, is frustrated with politicians of all stripes in Washington for their failure to manage taxpayer money. We asked her if Chambliss is correct about this claim.

""It’s true,"" said MacGuineas, who describes herself as a political independent.

Defense officials are proposing to cut health care costs by increasing health care fees, copays and deductibles for retirees.

Any way you slice the numbers, it appears the senator’s claim is based on some solid numbers. Health care spending was the fastest-rising cost over the most recent five years, Defense Department figures show. It is also projected to be the fastest-rising cost over the next five years.

We rate this Chambliss claim as True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967970C0>],/factchecks/2012/may/02/saxby-chambliss/senators-claim-military-health-care-costs-going-hi/

Did Amanda Fritz inaccurately claim an endorsement from NARAL?
","
Earlier last week, state Rep. Mary Nolan, D-Portland, issued a press release brimming with accusations against Portland City Commissioner Amanda Fritz. Nolan, who is running to unseat Fritz, said the incumbent had inaccurately claimed an endorsement from NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon: 
""Fritz publicly claimed to be endorsed by NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon, both on her website and in the voter’s guide. However, NARAL has given its sole endorsement to Mary Nolan. Fritz vowed to change the listing on her website and issue a statement correcting the error, but has failed to do so,"" the press release stated.

The city of Portland doesn’t have much, if anything, to do with federal and state abortion policies. Still, an endorsement from a reproductive rights group probably matters in a left-leaning city where the two leading candidates for a council seat are both Democrats and women. Also, it just looks bad when a candidate makes up an endorsement. We set to find out the truth.

First we checked the state Voters’ Pamphlet. Fritz lists among her supporters ""NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon Choice Action Team."" On her campaign website, she lists a ""green light"" designation from both ""Basic Rights Oregon PAC (co-designation) and NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon Choice Action Team.""

Naturally you’re asking, what’s a choice action team and what’s a green light designation?

The NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon PAC Board makes endorsements only at the statewide and legislative level, said executive director Michele Stranger Hunter. The Choice Action Team is a group of active volunteers within NARAL that studies local races and simply identifies whether the candidate is pro-choice or not. The Choice Action Team can only ""green-light"" a candidate; the team cannot make endorsements.

NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon made an exception for Nolan, Stranger Hunter said, because of her exceptional advocacy. Nolan is able to get campaign help from NARAL.

We asked Fritz if she had claimed an ""endorsement"" from NARAL. The commissioner emailed to say that she ""mistakenly put NARAL ProChoice Oregon Choice Action Team""  under the list of union and other group endorsements on her campaign website. Contacted by NARAL, Fritz reorganized her web site to make sure voters knew there was no endorsement, she said.

Fritz also offered to PolitiFact Oregon statements of endorsements by NARAL’s Choice Action Team filed with county elections officials. They are signed by Caitlin Campbell, a field organizer, and allow the use of her name and the Choice Action Team. Fritz did not mention the group in The Oregonian’s Voter Guide at NARAL’s request.

We went back to Nolan and told her Fritz had specified the Choice Action Team online and in print. Nolan, in response, told PolitiFact Oregon that Fritz should not cite any part of NARAL given that there is an endorsed candidate in the race.

We called Todd Foster, chairman of NARAL’s political action committee. He said that a green-light does not mean the group supports the candidate, despite Campbell’s signed statement. So Fritz cannot claim support or an endorsement. (And neither can a lot of other candidates, apparently, including mayoral candidate Eileen Brady, who listed the Choice Action Team under ""endorsements"" in the Voters’ Pamphlet and another mayoral candidate, Jefferson Smith, who listed the Choice Action Team under ""supporters."")

We have one final bit of evidence to share. Nolan’s campaign sent along a clip from the Portland City Club debate March 30, during which Fritz claimed an endorsement from NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon. NARAL contacted her after the event and Fritz apologized and agreed to refrain from stating so in the future.

So where are we with a ruling?

We know Fritz inaccurately stated an endorsement at the City Club debate. But we don’t think we should factor that into the ruling because Nolan did not specify that in her statement, and Fritz amended her connection to NARAL after the March 30 debate.

We also know that most voters likely wouldn’t know the difference between NARAL and its Choice Action Team. They would think the action team is the same as NARAL, when it’s not. So Nolan and NARAL are within their rights to complain about the confusion.

Fritz did claim an endorsement on her website. (Then she fixed it.) But as Nolan argued herself to PolitiFact Oregon, words matter. And here, Fritz did not claim an endorsement from NARAL Pro-Choice Oregon in print. She listed the Choice Action Team under supporters and online as a green-light giver. She even received written permission from a Choice Action Team person to use the group’s name in the Voters’ Pamphlet.

NARAL says Fritz shouldn’t claim support but other candidates are freely doing the same thing without complaint from the group’s leaders.

The statement is accurate about the website, but inaccurate about the voters’ guide. We find Nolan’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096D0E800>],/factchecks/2012/may/02/mary-nolan/did-amanda-fritz-inaccurately-claim-endorsement-na/

COVID-19 tests are not ‘scientifically meaningless’
","The United States has ramped up its COVID-19 testing capacity this summer in an effort to slow the spread of the virus. Some bloggers and Facebook users say that’s a mistake. In a June 27 article, a website called OffGuardian wrote that the tests many health care providers use to diagnose COVID-19 are ""scientifically meaningless."" ""These PCR tests are meaningless as a diagnostic tool to determine an alleged infection by a supposedly new virus called SARS-CoV-2,"" reads the article, which has been shared more than thousands of times on Facebook. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) It has also been copy-pasted into text posts, which have also been shared thousands of times. (Screenshot from Facebook) OffGuardian was launched in 2015. The site’s name comes from the fact that its founders were all ""banned from the Guardian’s ‘Comment is Free’ sections,"" according to its about section. OffGuardian has a track record of publishing conspiracy theories and Russian propaganda, so we wanted to take a closer look at its claim about COVID-19 testing. The article is inaccurate — polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests are among the most common and reliable ways to test for the coronavirus. Similar claims have circulated, and have been fact-checked, since March. There are three main coronavirus tests: diagnostic, antibody and antigen. Diagnostic tests, also known as PCR tests, look for the genetic material of the coronavirus in a sample that’s typically taken from a person’s nose or throat. Health care providers and public health officials use them to confirm whether someone has the disease. In a fact sheet for its PCR test, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the test is ""designed to detect the virus that causes COVID-19 in respiratory specimens, for example nasal or oral swabs."" ""If you have a positive test result, it is very likely that you have COVID-19,"" the document says. That’s because PCR tests amplify small segments of DNA, making it easier for labs to test for the presence of SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19. Health care providers have also used them for detecting viruses like HIV. It usually takes several days to get results.  In its 4,500-word article, OffGuardian lays out several (inaccurate) theories about PCR tests. None of them prove that the tests are ""scientifically meaningless."" OffGuardian wrote in its article that the inventor of the PCR test, Kary Mullis, ""regarded the PCR as inappropriate to detect a viral infection."" In a fact-check, Reuters rated that claim false — the source is a 1996 article about HIV/AIDS. It does not say PCR tests are ineffective for detecting viruses. OffGuardian makes several other inaccurate claims in its article, including: ""There are no distinctive specific symptoms for COVID-19."" The CDC says otherwise. ""The existence of SARS-CoV-2 RNA is based on faith, not fact."" Several researchers have analyzed the genetic material of the coronavirus — including its RNA. Between 22% and 77% ""of the ‘positive’ tests are false ‘positives.’"" Currently, about 92% of tests in the United States produce negative results. RELATED: Coronavirus testing: What we know, all in one place There are legitimate questions about the accuracy of diagnostic COVID-19 tests, particularly for people who are not experiencing symptoms. There have been several cases of tests producing the wrong results, and some experts are concerned about false-negatives. But OffGuardian’s claim about PCR tests is inaccurate and ridiculous. We rate it Pants on Fire!",[<zip object at 0x000002809A3FB080>],/factchecks/2020/jul/07/blog-posting/covid-19-tests-are-not-scientifically-meaningless/

Pelosi compares cost of state and local aid from coronavirus relief bill to 2017 tax cuts
","To put the size of a Democratic-proposed coronavirus relief bill into perspective, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi compared its costs with the debt she says was incurred by the Republican-backed 2017 tax bill.  Speaking to ABC News’ ""This Week"" host George Stephanopoulos about the Heroes Act, a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill passed by the House in May, Pelosi said, ""All of that money that is out there, and it is very significant, is half of what the Republicans put onto the national debt."" We wondered if that’s accurate, so we reached out to Pelosi’s team to learn more about what she was referencing in her comment. We found that while her specific comparison has merit, it lacks context about the level of overall bipartisan support for measures that have added to the national debt. Let’s take a look.  Drew Hammill, Pelosi’s deputy chief of staff, told PolitiFact in an email that Pelosi was referring to the portion of the Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions Act that would provide aid to state and local governments.  The so-called Heroes Act, which aims to provide money to state and local governments, small businesses, and households, received the support of just one Republican, Rep. Pete King of New York, while 14 Democrats voted against it in the House. The Senate hasn’t taken up the bill. The legislation’s state and local aid would add $1.13 trillion to the deficit when calculated over a ten year period, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Hammill said that Pelosi’s phrase, ""half of what the Republicans put onto the national debt,"" refers to the impact of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, which passed without a single Democratic vote in Congress and was signed by President Donald Trump. The Congressional Budget Office estimated in 2018 that the act would add $1.8 trillion to the deficit over 10 years, or more than $2.3 trillion including added interest expenses on the national debt. Using those figures, the state and local aid from the proposed coronavirus relief bill would cost 49% or 63% as much as the 2017 tax bill, depending on whether it's compared to the tax act estimate alone or with added interest. It gave tax cuts to corporations and individuals, and those cuts disproportionately benefit wealthier taxpayers. Steve Ellis, president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, said in an email to PolitiFact that Pelosi’s statement sounded accurate. ""If she was saying it how the speaker’s staff is characterizing it, yes, it is roughly half as much,"" Ellis wrote. However, the impact of the 2017 tax cut is still a projection and might be affected by the recession, Ellis said.  Pelosi’s statement is largely correct with respect to the tax cut bill, but it doesn’t tell the whole story of how other measures supported by both parties have contributed to increasing the national debt during Trump’s time in office.  All told, Trump has signed legislation that has added $4.7 trillion to the debt since 2017, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. That figure includes the 2017 tax bill, the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 ($445 billion), the Bipartisan Budget Act of 2019 ($1.7 trillion) and the 2019 spending deal that repealed Affordable Care Act taxes ($500 billion), among others. The 2018 and 2019 budget bills and the 2019 spending deal all received large numbers of both Democratic and Republican support.  Referring to the proposed Heroes Act approved by the House, Pelosi said, ""All of that money that is out there, and it is very significant, is half of what the Republicans put onto the national debt."" Pelosi’s statement has merit in that the state and local aid proposed in the Democratic coronavirus relief bill amounts to about half of the projected 10-year deficits created by the Republican tax cuts in 2017. But it implies that Republicans alone are to blame for increases to the national debt. A broader look at legislation signed by Trump shows that both parties have supported legislation that has added to the national debt. We rate the statement Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x00000280973E4B80>],/factchecks/2020/jul/07/nancy-pelosi/pelosi-compares-cost-state-and-local-aid-coronavir/

Donald Trump’s false claim that 99% of COVID-19 cases are harmless
","In a Fourth of July celebration with jets flying overhead and soldiers parachuting through the air, President Donald Trump minimized the threat of the coronavirus. With cases surging across many states, Trump said the latest numbers were promising. ""We have tested over 40 million people,"" Trump said July 4. ""By so doing, we show cases, 99% of which are totally harmless. Results that no other country will show, because no other country has testing that we have — not in terms of the numbers or in terms of the quality."" ""Totally harmless"" is a strong term, and while people can debate the finer points of what represents harm, no definition backs up Trump’s 99% figure. We reached out to the White House and the Trump campaign for the underlying data and did not hear back. Death is the least likely outcome of catching this disease. If Trump’s figure was going to be right, it would show up in how many people the virus has killed. Counting deaths from COVID-19 is an inexact science, but no data source shows a rate lower than 4.2%, based on the numbers of identified cases According to the government’s tally at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, since the virus hit, there have been about 2.8 million cases. The death toll has reached nearly 130,000.  That would produce a case death rate of 4.5%. Remember, researchers don’t know the number of people infected — only the confirmed cases. The infection tally would be larger than the number of identified cases. Some researchers expect the global fatality rate to come down, with the caveat that it will be higher for more vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and people with underlying health problems. Epidemiologists say we continue to learn more about COVID-19 and the damage it causes short of death. ""To cavalierly say that only 1% of infections result in problems is wildly inaccurate,"" said  Donald Thea, Boston University professor of global health. ""We are seeing reports of young people who have recovered from mild cases developing diabetes or blood clots and suffering from chronic fatigue, respiratory compromise, persistent fever or coming back with bacterial sepsis weeks later. There's too many reports of other organ damage that hints that there are possible long term serious implications."" And that doesn’t speak to hospitalizations. By most standards, anything that sends someone to the hospital has done significant damage. Numbers from the COVID Tracking Project give some idea of the hospitalization trends. Unlike the cumulative death rate, this data gives a window into the number of hospitalizations that emerged out of each day’s newly identified cases. The rate has been falling since early June, when it was 8%. But it still sits at 4%, or four times higher than Trump’s 1% figure. Researchers agree that while counting the number of cases is important, one of the most important aspects of the coronavirus remains murky — how many people have been infected by the virus. This is very different from looking at the known cases, because it includes the people who never show symptoms. By one CDC estimate, the total could be 10 to 12 times higher than the number of identified cases. If deaths and hospitalizations remained the same, the threat of death and harm would fall dramatically. The problem is, Thea said, we lack reliable numbers to fill in any of those boxes. He expects the estimated number of infections to grow, but so will the estimated number of deaths. ""We’re undercounting those deaths by 20% to 40%, conservatively,"" Thea said. ""There is a year-to-year-stability in death rates. We’ve seen an enormous amount of excess deaths, and the large majority of the excess mortality is due to the infection itself.""  Trump said that 99% of all COVID-19 cases are totally harmless. The White House provided no supporting data. Looking at the worst possible outcome, the government’s numbers show a cumulative death rate of 4.5%, although the actual fatality rate could end up lower once we learn more about the disease  The rate at which new cases lead to hospitalizations has fallen, but it still remains at 4%. And public health researchers note that more and more, there are reports that even people with mild cases are hit with medical problems after they’ve recovered. There’s a lot more to be learned about this disease, but nothing says that it’s harmless for 99% of the people it touches.

Is Mask Wearing Causing Fungal Lung Infections? No, This Is Another Bogus Claim On Facebook
","A widely-circulated Facebook post claims people are checking into emergency rooms with fungal lung infections due to wearing masks to prevent COVID-19.  ""People are starting to enter ERs with fungal lung infections from wearing masks!! Take breaks from your masks.""  The claim, posted on July 2, had been shared 16,000 times and viewed nearly 700,000 times over the past 24 hours.  It was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about PolitiFact California’s partnership with Facebook). With more states requiring face coverings in public settings, and lots of false claims spreading about masks, we wanted to know whether there’s any truth to this provocative statement.  We set out on a fact check. Misinformation About Masks This is far from the first social media post to claim that wearing masks is harmful to your health. In June, PolitiFact National debunked the multi-part allegation that claimed wearing masks for the coronavirus ""decreases oxygen intake, increases toxin inhalation, shuts down immune system"" and ""increases virus risk."" It rated the claim False.  In May, PolitiFact rated False a similar claim that wearing a mask causes health problems, particularly from breathing in too much exhaled carbon dioxide. It found there’s no credible data to back that up. ""Experts say prolonged use of N95 respirator masks can increase blood CO2 levels for people with breathing problems, but those masks are not recommended for the general public, and using ordinary cloth or surgical masks poses little or no risk from CO2,"" PolitiFact reported.  Fungal Infections? With those fact checks in mind, we examined whether people are truly showing up at ERs with fungal lung infections due to wearing masks. We reached out to regional, statewide and national experts and found no supporting evidence.  ""Neither the chair of our emergency department nor the head of our infectious diseases division have seen that type of condition in a patient after an individual has been using a face mask,"" a spokesperson for UC Davis Health in Sacramento wrote in an email.  After looking into the claim, Elena Lopez-Gusman, executive director of the California chapter of the American College of Emergency Physicians, called it ""as suspected, false.""  Finally, the national American College of Emergency Physicians told us they’ve seen no evidence supporting the claim.  ""While we’ve heard some folks complain about irritation, we have not heard of reports of fungal infections stemming from masks,"" Maggie McGillick, a spokesperson for ACEP wrote in an email. ""There are several professions where people wear masks for hours on end without issue."" The College released a statement last week encouraging people to cover their face when in public. ‘Recycled breathing’ not a real danger Taking a closer look at the Facebook post in question, some commenters wondered whether wearing a mask for hours on end might be harmful, while wearing it for just a short while might not be.  In an email, McGillick of ACEP addressed that concern: ""There is not a real danger to breathing in your own air or ‘recycled breathing,’ nor is the idea of low oxygen or carbon dioxide buildup a concern. However, there could be risk from someone’s mask getting contaminated from others and then transferring that to your mouth/eyes/etc. when you touch your own mask."" The spokesperson stressed that it’s important to avoid touching your face and to wash your hands before and after touching your mask. Some commenters on the Facebook post in question said they worried about the health effects of wearing masks. Yet others said they were skeptical of the claim given that doctors, nurses, mechanics and others wear masks for a prolonged period and don’t come down with fungal lung infections.  One medical professional jumped into the comments with her own fact check: ""It isn’t happening. I’m an ER nurse. This is not true at all.""  Sanitary Tips For Mask Wearing Earlier this month, the health information website MedicalNewsToday fact-checked a similar claim and found there ""is no evidence indicating that masks increase the wearer’s risk of developing pneumonia or other bacterial, viral, or fungal lung infections.""  It also included guidance from leading health organizations for how to safely handle your mask. It found the World Health Organization acknowledges ""that if a person wears the same mask for a long time, microorganisms may grow on the fabric.""  ""All masks should be changed if wet or visibly soiled; a wet mask should not be worn for an extended period of time. ... Either discard the mask or place it in a sealable bag where it is kept until it can be washed and cleaned,"" the WHO advises. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends ""that a person removes the face covering once they return home and washes it before using it again,"" the MedicalNewsToday article also noted.  Our ruling  A popular Facebook post alleges people are checking into ERs with fungal lung infections due to wearing masks to prevent the coronavirus. Regional, statewide and national emergency physicians groups said there’s no evidence to back up this claim.  Medical experts recommend wearing face coverings to slow the transmission of COVID-19 and say the effects of wearing the coverings are not harmful.  They also encourage people to wash their hands and their masks on a regular basis to avoid contamination.  This claim about mask-wearing leading to fungal lung infections is bogus.  We rated it False.  FALSE – The statement is not accurate.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097834C40>],/factchecks/2020/jul/06/facebook-posts/mask-wearing-causing-fungal-lung-infections-no-ano/

No proof '1 million' North Carolinians exposed to coronavirus
","A North Carolina congressman says 10% of his state’s population has been exposed to the novel coronavirus. U.S. Rep. Greg Murphy, a doctor and a Republican, made the claim in a June 23 Facebook post criticizing Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper. ""We also found out over the weekend that antibody testing conducted by Dr. John Sanders at Wake Forest University showed that over 1 million people in North Carolina have now been exposed to the virus. How could another institution in our state get this done so quickly when the governor’s administration could not?"" Murphy wrote. Is Murphy right that 1 million North Carolinians have been exposed to the novel coronavirus? This particular claim stands out for several reasons: 1 million people equates to roughly 10% of North Carolina’s population, which is a little more than 10 million.  North Carolina’s total number of lab-reported cases hasn't hit 100,000.  At the time of Murphy’s tweet, the World Health Organization reported that there were fewer than 9 million cases reported worldwide. There were fewer than 3 million cases in the United States as of July 6, according to the CDC. Some people contract the virus and never know it because they don’t experience symptoms. So they would not be counted in tallies of confirmed positive cases that are often reported. The New York Times reported in June that the number of infections in certain parts of the country could be 10 times higher than the number of reported cases, based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data. In his Facebook post, Murphy makes an estimate based on preliminary data in an antibody study at Wake Forest University. But the post goes too far. Murphy frames the data as conclusive, something Wake Forest researchers and state officials aren’t willing to do. The first thing to know is an antibody test isn’t the same thing as a standard coronavirus test, often referred to as a ""diagnostic"" test. Diagnostic tests tell you whether you are presently sick with the virus. These types of tests are being administered and tracked by governments around the world. Antibody tests, as the CDC points out, detect proteins in your body that help fight off infections and can provide protection against a disease that you’ve been exposed to. So an antibody test may detect if you had a past infection with the virus that causes COVID-19.  However, the CDC says the tests aren’t always definitive. Positive results can be triggered by other coronavirus strains, not just COVID-19. They also don’t show you whether you are currently infected with the virus. And scientists aren’t sure yet whether the presence of antibodies means someone is immune from the virus. So what did the Wake Forest University study say? The study, which state lawmakers sponsored in April, initially mailed tests to 1,000 North Carolinians.  By mid-June, nearly 10% of the 5,000 people tested showed signs of antibodies, according to a story by WRAL. By June 30, the number of positive antibody tests had climbed to 12% from the study’s sample size of 18,000. Wake researchers hope to enroll more than 500,000 participants. And they post their updates online.  Does that mean that 10% of North Carolinians have been exposed to the virus? No.  The CDC has made estimates about coronavirus exposure in six select cases. But North Carolina is not one of them. Dr. John Sanders, section head of infectious diseases at Wake Forest Baptist Health and the lead researcher for the study, told PolitiFact that the study doesn’t have enough data yet to make an estimate about infections in North Carolina. ""Wake Forest Baptist Health has not extrapolated its data to cover the entire state,"" Sanders said through a spokesperson. Wake tracks the residence of participants. As of June 30, researchers had an abundance of evidence from the Winston-Salem area and far less from Wake and Mecklenburg counties — the two most populous areas of the state. ""The study's data is robust for our region but may not fully represent the state at this time,"" Sanders said.  ""Our partners at Atrium Health are currently collecting data and expanding the sampling reach,"" he added. ""As we add WakeMed Health, Vidant Health and New Hanover to the study, more broad research and data will be available."" We asked North Carolina’s health department if they believe the study results represent coronavirus exposure in the state. ""No, the proportion with positive antibodies depends on who is tested and we don’t have data yet to tell us what that proportion is statewide,"" said Kelly Haight Connor, the department’s communications manager. NC’s health department is also involved in other antibody prevalence studies, Connor said. So far, those studies found fewer positive returns. ""The first of those studies found SARS-CoV-2 antibodies in samples from 6.4% of random samples from 1,780 patients collected from mid-April to mid-May at UNC hospitals (Chapel Hill, Rex, Chatham and Johnston),"" she said.  ""This study is on-going; researchers are doing additional analyses and will continue testing to monitor for changes over time."" Researchers believe more people have been exposed than the case reports show. But they’re not predicting a figure as high as 10%. Paul Delamater, assistant professor in the Department of Geography at UNC-Chapel Hill, and Julie Swann, head of the Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering at North Carolina State University, told WRAL on July 6 that they believe roughly 500,000 people could have been exposed to the virus. Murphy said a study ""showed that over 1 million people in North Carolina have now been exposed to the virus."" A Wake Forest study found that 10% of participants might have antibodies for the virus. But the leader of the study and NC health department officials say there’s not enough data yet to make an estimate about how many people have been exposed to coronavirus. Murphy extrapolated the data before it was ready.

No, a national coin shortage during COVID-19 was not intentional
","Maybe you’ve seen signs in retail stores about a coin shortage, which led to a widely shared conspiracy theory on Facebook. ""National Coin Shortage Just Beginning. The national coin shortage was done intentionally, the mint is no longer releasing coins into circulation aka this is the beginning of the end of paper money,"" the July 2 post says in part, arguing it’s part of a decades-old plan toward enabling a ""soon coming one world government"" to track every private transaction. ""First it will be coins, then one dollar bills and in a not so distant future cash will not be accepted at any store."" The post includes what appears to be a photograph of a sign inside of a grocery store that says: ""Our country is experiencing a national coin shortage"" and asking customers to use exact change or non-cash forms of payment. Some commenters posted images of what appear to be retail store signs with similar messages. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We found there was a coronavirus-induced shortage of coins, but no evidence of a plan to eradicate pocket change. Many news outlets reported in June that across the country, coins were hard to find. ""Coins have become scarce as virus lockdowns keep people from emptying their coin jars in exchange for paper bills,"" the New York Times reported. ""The Latest Pandemic Shortage: Coins Are The New Toilet Paper,"" said NPR, describing how banks were running low on nickels, dimes and quarters, in turn leading to shortages at retail outlets. ""With the partial closure of the economy, the flow of coins through the economy has gotten all…it’s kind of stopped,"" Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell told a House subcommittee. The Fed announced June 11 a ""strategic allocation of coin inventories,"" saying:  ""The COVID‐19 pandemic has significantly disrupted the supply chain and normal circulation patterns for U.S. coin. In the past few months, coin deposits from depository institutions to the Federal Reserve have declined significantly and the U.S. Mint’s production of coin also decreased due to measures put in place to protect its employees."" The Fed also said it would work to ""maximize coin production capacity."" U.S. Mint spokesman Todd Martin told PolitiFact that in the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak, the Mint reduced the number of employees per shift in order to enhance social distancing, leading to a reduction in production of 10% in April and 20% in May. At the same time, reduced sales activity meant retailers were ordering more coins from the Mint because they were receiving fewer of them as people stayed home, he said. Coin production began to ramp up in May with mandatory Saturday overtime, the Mint returned to full production by mid-June, and nearly 1.6 billion coins were produced in June, Martin said. In short, the coin shortage was caused by reduced retail activity and a temporary reduction in production, both due to COVID-19. It was not, as this post suggests, done ""intentionally"" as part of a plan to eliminate paper money.

Joe Biden correct that Trump administration delayed, scaled back CDC reopening guidelines
","Joe Biden berated President Donald Trump’s handling of the COVID-19 pandemic, saying in a recent speech in Delaware that Trump failed to take the necessary steps to get the virus under control. Biden, the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee, said the administration stifled and scaled back the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s initial guidelines on reopening the country.  ""The CDC tried to develop clear guidelines about what the stages of reopening should look like — the administration delayed and scaled them back,"" Biden said June 30. Did they? Here’s what we found out. Biden’s campaign pointed us to a May 7, 2020, Associated Press report, which found that the Trump administration shelved part of a CDC document that contained step-by-step advice to local authorities on how and when to reopen businesses and public areas amid the pandemic.  The 68-page CDC report, titled ""Guidance for Implementing the Opening Up America Again Framework,"" was supposed to publish on May 1, according to the AP, but the White House called it ""too prescriptive."" The White House told the agency revise its guide because it didn’t align with Trump’s strategy of giving states the final say.  The CDC released the approved 62-page report on May 20. (Some sections were released a few days earlier.) While it’s slightly shorter than the original, it still provides a detailed reopening roadmap for schools, camps, restaurants, child care facilities and transit organizations.  In a May 8 press briefing, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany countered that the CDC guidelines weren't ready and said that a rogue employee leaked a draft that was still in the editing process. After the final guidelines were released, she was asked in another briefing why Trump didn’t make an announcement. McEnany said that sections of the document were already out and different appendixes had to be discussed first. ""The 60-page document was merely an aggregation of a lot of what was already out there, so it’s not as if this was new information that we were announcing, but it was more guidance pursuant to our ‘reopening of America’ guidance that was issued several weeks ago,"" McEnany said.  The CDC also said the guidelines are meant to be taken together with the White House’s reopening guidance issued on April 17, 2020. But the White House version makes clear reopening decisions are up to state and local officials, while the CDC’s version includes more details, such as recommendations to help businesses decide when to shut down in the case of future outbreaks.  The original plan also included instructions for faith-based organizations, which were stripped out of the final version.   CNN reported that this section was one of the main holdups for publishing the CDC documents, because the Department of Health and Human Services’ Office for Civil Rights argued that faith-based organizations were being unfairly targeted. The department asked the CDC to ease social distancing recommendations for those groups, according to CNN, and encouraged federal health officials to let churchgoers congregate, saying that this aligned with the president’s agenda. The shelved CDC guide also recommended that nonessential travel should be avoided until the last phase of reopening, while the released version only mentions nonessential travel in relation to high-risk persons. The White House plan is looser on nonessential travel, too, and advises that communities ""minimize"" travel in Phase 1, and that in Phase 2, ""non-essential travel can resume."" Some health experts and officials have criticized the delay, saying that detailed recommendations should have been available earlier. ""While it is not unusual for there to be White House review of forthcoming guidance, it is highly unusual for there to be a wholesale rewriting of guidelines at the request of the White House,"" said Jeffrey Levi, a professor of health policy and management at George Washington University.  ""The holding back of recommendations regarding places of worship was particularly egregious given the high level of risk such indoor, mass gatherings can pose,"" Levi said. ""The shorter versions that were first released diminished their effectiveness, since they didn’t provide as much detail as people needed to know how best to implement them. This delayed implementation of best practices — which could potentially have placed people at greater risk."" But the CDC told PolitiFact the report’s revisions were part of a standard interagency process with the White House coronavirus task force. ""There is an iterative effort to ensure effective, clear guidance is presented to the American people,"" said Benjamin Haynes, a spokesperson for the CDC. ""As part of the Administration’s whole of government approach to combating COVID-19, the CDC followed an inter-agency process of drafting considerations and submitting them to the White House Task Force for review and comment before posting the guidance for states to safely reopen."" PolitiFact reached out to the White House for comment but did not hear back. Biden said that the Trump administration ""delayed and scaled back"" the CDC’s COVID-19 reopening guidelines.  Biden is mostly on target. The CDC said that the delays were caused by review and revision that was part of a standard process. Still, the White House did request that the public health agency revise its initial guidelines to align more with Trump’s approach of leaving reopening decisions up to state and local governments. We rate this Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C443F40>],/factchecks/2020/jul/06/joe-biden/joe-biden-correct-trump-administration-delayed-sca/
"['Health Care', 'States', 'Wisconsin', 'Tim Carpenter']","
Yes, Wisconsin Republicans did increase state funding for nursing homes in the last budget
","Nursing homes in Wisconsin have been hit hard by the coronavirus.  One in four facilities in the state have had at least one case of COVID-19, and Gov. Tony Evers in late May directed $100 million in federal CARES Act funding to nursing homes and other long-term care providers to ease the financial burden of the pandemic.  How the state funds its nursing homes, then, became the subject of a May 23, 2020, Twitter exchange between state Rep. Jim Steineke, R-Kaukauna, and state Sen. Tim Carpenter, D-Milwaukee.  Steineke, who has said he believes Evers should have allocated more of the federal money to nursing homes, asked whether Carpenter also thought the facilities should have received a bigger piece of the CARES Act pie.  Carpenter responded, ""Why didn’t the GOP increase state funding for nursing homes in the last budget?""  Did nursing homes get a boost from the state in Wisconsin’s last budget, or is Carpenter correct?  Let’s dig in.  Evers sought to expand Medicaid and free up state tax dollars in the 2019-21 biennial budget by tapping into $1 billion in federal funds through the Affordable Care Act.  Republican lawmakers on the Joint Finance Committee rejected that effort, but did allocate an additional $30 million in state dollars to nursing homes.  For every 41 cents the state spends on most Medicaid programs, the federal government will spend 59 cents, meaning the full increase in funding for nursing homes in the current biennium totaled about $74 million.  So the GOP did increase state funding for nursing homes in the last budget — just through state tax dollars, instead of Evers’ proposed reliance on federal funds.  When asked to provide evidence to back his claim, Carpenter pointed to a May 28, 2020 memo from the Legislative Fiscal Bureau — which he sought — detailing declining state and federal spending for medical assistance fee-for-service payments to nursing homes. That data does show the expenditures have been dropping since at least the 2011-12 fiscal year.  These payments designate how much money the state and the federal Medicaid program are paying nursing homes to care for seniors with limited resources.  But the state is not spending less because state lawmakers failed to fund nursing homes. The state is spending less because fewer Medicaid recipients are choosing to live in nursing homes.  Care recipients are increasingly preferring to reside in non-nursing home settings, the memo says, favoring home and community-based settings or smaller, more home-like assisted living facilities.  The total number of days that Medicaid pays for a senior in a Wisconsin nursing home has dropped nearly 40% in the last decade or so, from about 6 million days during the 2010-11 fiscal year to about 3.7 million days during the 2017-18 fiscal year, the memo says.  As a result, with fewer days to pay for, spending declines. Meanwhile, the state has increased the dollar amount paid per day to nursing homes.  In 2017, that rate was $174.61, according to a Department of Health Services spokeswoman. In 2018, it was $181.08, and in 2019, it was $191.50. The 2018-19 fiscal year’s average daily rate is approximately 17% higher than it was during the 2010-11 fiscal year, the memo says.  That said, even as rates increased, as the number of days paid decreased, total spending dropped. And, in any case, Carpenter’s claim was limited to GOP actions in the most recent budget, not any decline over time. Carpenter claimed Republicans didn't ""increase state funding for nursing homes in the last budget."" But they did increase funding for nursing homes in the 2019-21 biennial budget, allocating $30 million in state dollars. When the federal match is included, that added up to about $74 million more.  Carpenter cited declining overall state spending on nursing homes, but the reason those expenditures decreased is because fewer Medicaid recipients are residing in nursing homes. Meanwhile, rates charged for those Medicaid recipients have increased over the years.  We rate Carpenter’s claim False.

Did software cause Wisconsin's unemployment backlogs? Not quite, but it did delay payments
","In Wisconsin, the surge in unemployment claims due to the COVID-19 pandemic has led to a surge of frustration from those out of work who are relying on the state for help. More than 150,000 applicants have faced issues with claims, resulting in weeks -- and sometimes months -- without getting much-needed payments.  So far, the state Department of Workforce Development, which oversees the payments, has blamed the problem largely on a decades-old software program that powers the system. But state Sen. Chris Kapenga, R- Delafield, has a different take on blaming software for the backlog. ""It is a complete lie,"" Kapenga said in a June 21, 2020 interview on WTMJ radio. ""The software they’re using for back-end processing has nothing to do with the problems that are caused right now.""  He went on to say he believes mismanagement is to blame for the issues, as well as a lack of employees and a failure to have a plan to handle an inundation of claims.  Is he right that the Evers administration is wrongly blaming the software system? When asked to provide backup for the claim, Kapenga said that the software can’t be the root of the problem, because the problems leading to the backlogs are actually starting before the computer system, known as COBOL, would even be involved. ""A basic explanation to help better understand this issue is that COBOL is simply the ‘delivery person’ that takes the check to the claimant once all the other systems and processes determine who, where and how much,"" he said in a June 24, 2020 email. ""The massive backlog in payment of claims is because one or all of the pieces of information required to make the delivery has not yet been determined.  ""The system can’t do its job if it isn’t told what to do.""  He said that in order to get the who, where and how much into the system, the department needs more staff to do the work, which is where the problem lies.  ""I have stated publicly that they should have immediately pulled people in (from existing resources in other agencies) and worked 24/7 to manage the load,"" he said.  Kapenga’s view is supported by recent media reports, which have explored the same issue in other states that use the software to power their systems. An April 22, 2020 report from Wired.com, noted that COBOL is typically only used for back-office tasks, such as processing forms and payments, not for the front-end public interface that applicants see when they log on to the state website.  But the article highlights one issue that can cause backups when it comes to COBOL -- the fact making changes to the system requires coders familiar with the 60-year-old program.  So any change to the rules, such as the recent lifting of the one-week waiting period for new claims, has to be written into the code. And that takes time.  Ben Jedd, communications director for the Department of Workforce Development said in a June 24, 2020 email exchange that the reprogramming of the software did take time, resulting in some delays. For instance, the code had to be rewritten to handle three new federal programs that gave Wisconsinites more money, such as the $600 enhanced payment.   What’s more, he said, each of the changes had to be handled one at a time.  ""The linear nature of implementations of the new programs results in delays and increased backlog of claims for (the federal programs),"" he said. ""Additionally, due to the archaic nature of the system and lack of automation, processing of claims and subsequent release of benefits payments to claimants, requires a significant amount of manual exception processing further adding to the backlog.""  Jedd said that programming was done while state lawmakers were waiting to pass a bill that waived the standard one-week waiting period before getting benefits.  Once the law was signed, the programs had to be tested to be sure they were running correctly. That took two weeks.  Aside from the reprogramming, Jedd said other issues have contributed to the backlog, starting with ramping up staffing. That includes new hires to process claims and to sort out errors and adjudicate unusual circumstances. According to a June 19, 2020 article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, hundreds of new staff members had to be hired and trained, a process that took months. In all, the department says it has hired more than 1,000 people, including for the call center.  ""With unemployment as low as it was, the staffing levels were as low as they'd been in years,"" Jedd said. ""When the pandemic hit, we had to go from the lowest staffing level to the level needed to address this situation, which we have done as quickly as possible with the required recruiting, vetting, hiring, and training. ""It was not possible to onboard staff at the necessary levels overnight."" Kapenga claimed the Evers administration is wrong to blame old computer software being used to process unemployment claims, declaring it ""has nothing to do with"" the backlog. To be sure, there were many other problems leading to the backlog, including the sudden volume of claims and the need to ramp up staffing overnight. What’s more, there were several changes made to the system, including new payments and the waiver of a one-week waiting period. That’s where Kapenga is wrong to say the computer system had no role in delays. The decades-old system had to be reprogrammed to accommodate those changes -- and news reports note only coders familiar with the programs could get the job done. We rate the claim Half True.

DeSantis falsely claims he was never asked about COVID-19
","Gov. Ron DeSantis has a new narrative about Florida’s rising COVID-19 numbers: As cases leveled off in May, the media stopped covering the story, and the public grew complacent. DeSantis made this case during his July 2 meeting in Tampa with Vice President Mike Pence, where he said that the pandemic ""fell out of the news."" at the end of May and beginning of June. A week earlier, DeSantis said the media had returned its attention to the pandemic as the caseload grew in June amid reopenings of restaurants, shops and beaches. ""Well, I think now this is back in the news. I think people understand. Look, it was natural. It wasn’t much, I mean, I would do press events in May, I would never be asked about coronavirus,"" DeSantis said June 26. ""It was about all these other things. Now it’s something that they are (asking about)."" The other major news story that swept the nation and Florida starting in late May was the protests about police brutality and racism that followed George Floyd’s killing in police custody. As Florida journalists covered weeks of protests across the state, media outlets continued their pandemic coverage. In the week following Floyd’s death, we found news articles about Florida’s COVID-19 case numbers, reopenings of beaches and gyms in Broward, a photo gallery of pandemic life in Jacksonville, updates on openings and closings in southwest Florida, and the impact of the pandemic on hurricane planning, just to name a few of thousands of examples we found in Nexis. Reporters pushed back against DeSantis, so we wanted to look into it.  We found that multiple transcripts of DeSantis press conferences in May show reporters asking him about lifting COVID-19 restrictions on businesses, the state’s rising unemployment and flawed benefits system, the plan for addressing spikes, and outbreaks in nursing homes and prisons.  We sent a link to those transcripts to spokespersons for DeSantis and asked what he was referring to when he said he wasn’t asked about the coronavirus. We did not get a response to our emails or phone messages. The press conferences we reviewed showed DeSantis taking questions about COVID-19, even if that wasn’t the main topic of the event. Reporters asked him about the pandemic at press conferences on judicial appointments and a road construction project. We found at least a dozen times reporters asked DeSantis about COVID-19 in May. Here are a few examples. For our review, we used the transcript service Rev.com and video from the Florida Channel, a public affairs programming service based at the state Capitol. May 3: Reporters asked about applicants for unemployment, antibody testing and efforts to protect people in nursing homes as well as a prison outbreak. May 8: A reporter asked a question about the phases of reopening in South Florida.  May 11: DeSantis faced questions about people awaiting unemployment checks and the state’s unemployment website. A reporter started to ask a question about one of the covid case models that the state was looking at and DeSantis interjected: ""Has that been accurate so far? Have any of the models been accurate so far?"" May 13: DeSantis faced a couple of questions about cases in long-term facilities including if he had considered testing for all residents and staff and why Florida was not pursuing the White House recommendation to test everyone in nursing homes.  May 15: Reporters asked questions about unemployment as well as when bars would be allowed to reopen and vacation rentals could resume. A reporter also asked if parents should send their children to summer camp. May 22: Reporters asked questions about lifting restrictions, the number of pending unemployment claims and if the state had a plan if COVID-19 spiked in the future. DeSantis said, ""I would do press events in May, I would never be asked about coronavirus,'' His spokespersons did not respond to our multiple queries to figure out which events he had in mind. Our own review shows that he was asked about coronavirus issues at many press conferences. Questions related to unemployment, nursing homes, rules about reopening and how the state would handle spikes. We rate this claim False.

Attack ad wrongly claims Pritzker hiked politicians’ pay during pandemic
","A new group affiliated with a national Republican opposition research organization is targeting Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker over the perennially fraught issue of lawmaker pay. Illinois Rising Action, a nonprofit launched in March by America Rising Squared, is out with an ad accusing Pritzker of putting the interests of politicians above those of working families during the COVID-19 pandemic. ""While voters were distracted, Pritzker gave huge pay raises to his politician buddies,"" a narrator says halfway through the 30-second spot, which includes boilerplate imagery of an envelope being passed across a table. The group has said it spent $1 million on the TV ad buy. The ad cites an article published in May by a news station based in Quincy, which claimed state lawmakers ""gave themselves an $1,800 pay raise"" by including a cost-of-living increase in the budget they approved for the new fiscal year, which began July 1. Leaders in the Democrat-controlled General Assembly, long vocal about refusing such raises, are adamant there is no raise on the books. So we decided to check it out. There’s an interesting history behind the way state lawmakers are compensated, a system long criticized as political cowardice. Decades ago, every time lawmakers wanted more taxpayer money in their personal bank accounts, they were required to pass a bill. Voting themselves pay raises in lean years was a liability come election time. So, through a series of acts in the 1980s criticized at the time as backdoor menuevers, they gave themselves an automatic cost-of-living bump each year. That means the only time lawmakers need to act on their personal pay is if they want to reject their automatic raises, which they have routinely done for most of the past decade. But last year a circuit court judge ruled unconstitutional the pay freezes for lawmakers passed during their terms. The longstanding maneuver was challenged in court by two former lawmakers who want their back pay. The state is appealing that judge’s ruling. This year — faced with that legal decision — Democratic leaders took a different approach by freezing legislator pay indirectly through their spending bill. Instead of rejecting the pay increase, they simply appropriated no money for it. It’s a move experts say could face similar legal challenges from dissenting lawmakers who feel entitled to their raises. Republican lawmakers are suspicious of this new tactic, which comes only a year after Pritzker signed a budget that gave legislators their first raise since 2008, hiking their base pay to more than $69,000. The governor defended that increase based on ""how hard these legislators are working."" This year, Pritzker and the General Assembly have promised no such raises, a point Pritzker reiterates in a TV spot of his own responding to Illinois Rising Action’s attack. So we asked Illinois Rising Action for their evidence that lawmakers are getting a raise this year thanks to Pritzker. Kayleen Carlson, the group’s executive director, referred to yet another law, passed in 2014, that made lawmaker pay a ""continuing appropriation,"" which she argues makes the $0 appropriation for raises in the budget Pritzker signed an empty gesture. ""Since 2014, Illinois law automatically increases state lawmakers’ pay through a ‘continuing appropriation,’"" Carlson wrote in an email. ""This means that legislators who want to foreclose a pay increase must pass a bill specifically to do so."" Regardless, Democratic Comptroller Susana Mendoza, the official in charge of cutting the state’s checks, promises there will be no raises this fiscal year. She even released a video to underscore that message. Experts say the decades of political gamesmanship lawmakers have used to avoid voting for their own pay raises may be finally coming to a head. Charles N. Wheeler III, who has followed the General Assembly for decades as both a journalist and professor at the University of Illinois Springfield, said there is one obvious fix — go back to the politically inconvenient practice of forcing lawmakers to vote on pay increases. One Republican senator proposed legislation in February to do just that, but the bill died in committee without ever coming up for a vote. Under that legislation, the fix wouldn’t take effect until 2023, when lawmakers will all begin new terms. As for the ad’s claim, Wheeler called it ""a convenient misstatement of the facts."" ""If you wanted to be more accurate, you would say the governor and the Democratic majorities failed to take the actions that would have been needed to eliminate these things going forward,"" he said. ""But that’s not as effective as saying, ‘he gave his buddies a pay raise.’"" Illinois Rising Action’s ad says ""while voters were distracted, Pritzker gave huge pay raises to his politician buddies."" The group was referencing the annual cost-of-living adjustments legislators are provided with automatically under state law. For most of the past decade, legislators have passed bills rejecting those raises. Because of a recent legal decision, lawmakers used a different maneuver to freeze pay this year in the budget Pritzker signed. Lawmakers have gotten no pay raise this year, and the governor made no moves designed to give them one. We rate this claim False. FALSE — The statement is not accurate.

But over the past several weeks, many social media users — including Musk, the CEO of Tesla and SpaceX — have passed on secondhand stories about fraudulent COVID-19 tests or unproven claims about false-positives. So we wanted to look into the notion that labs are falsifying COVID-19 test results. Public health officials say that false-positive tests are rare; the real concern is false-negatives.  While COVID-19 tests may sometimes produce false-positive results, there is no evidence that labs are deliberately manipulating samples. And public health officials are more concerned about false-negatives than false-positives. There are three main coronavirus tests: diagnostic, antibody and antigen. Diagnostic tests look for the genetic material of the coronavirus in a sample that’s typically taken from a person’s nose or throat. Health care providers and public health officials use them to confirm whether someone has the disease. Since diagnostic tests are considered the most common and reliable COVID-19 test, we’re going to focus on them. There are more than 100 diagnostic tests that have received emergency use authorization from the Food and Drug Administration. Many cities and health care providers use private firms like LabCorp and Quest Diagnostics to provide and process diagnostic coronavirus tests. We reached out to both companies for a comment, but we haven’t heard back. We could find no evidence that labs are deliberately altering coronavirus test results to create false-positives. RELATED: The international supply chain behind coronavirus testing The accuracy of a coronavirus diagnostic test depends on several factors, including the timing of the test and how it was stored. There have been several cases of tests producing the wrong results. In mid-May, the Food and Drug Administration issued a warning saying that a rapid-response test from Abbott Laboratories could produce false-negative results. Abbott advised health care providers not to store patient samples in solutions known as ""viral transport media."" The company said the swabs should be placed directly into the device and then the test will work as expected. The accuracy of COVID-19 tests, particularly for people who are not experiencing symptoms, is still uncertain. But false-positive results appear to be an outlier. A LabCorp fact sheet for the company’s diagnostic coronavirus test says there is a ""very small chance"" the test can give false-positive results. The instructions for a similar test from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say that false test results are ""highly dependent on prevalence."" ""False-negative test results are more likely when prevalence of disease is high,"" the document reads. ""False-positive test results are more likely when prevalence is moderate to low."" In layman's terms: as coronavirus infections increase, so does the chance of false-negative results. So it stands to reason that, as the U.S. continues to see new COVID-19 cases rise, false-negative results are more common than false-positives. That fact can have worse unintended consequences than false-positive results. People who receive false-negative results may not seek treatment for COVID-19 symptoms and risk infecting more people. Sebelia’s post inspired a slew of copy-pasted hoaxes about COVID-19 testing. Many cite friends or family members, and they echo months-old conspiracy theories about the coronavirus pandemic. A June 30 Facebook post is very similar to Sebelia’s story. ""Nurses at a hospital doing covid testing became suspicious when all their tests were coming back positive,"" reads the post. ""They sent 2 tests with unused swabs and they came back positive. Nurses used fake names, sent 10 unused swabs to be tested and all came back positive. We are being played!"" The post is a screenshot of a now-deleted tweet from a user named Robert Tayman, whose account was created in February and regularly promotes conspiratorial content. He said in a follow-up tweet (also deleted) that the nurses are ""close personal friends that work at a major hospital in Baltimore, Maryland."" (Screenshot from Twitter) The Baltimore Department of Health denied commenting for this story. Tayman’s tweet was deleted, but screenshots quickly made their way to Facebook, where they were shared thousands of times. The first few posts with Tayman’s tweet were published in conservative and anti-media groups on June 29, according to CrowdTangle. At first, users started off linking to the tweet, but soon users were posting screenshots of the post. Eventually, the text of the tweet was copied and shared with no context at all — similar to how chain emails work.  Another Facebook post, published June 29, also recounts the story about nurses sending in ""10 unused swabs"" that all came back positive. The post is a screenshot of an Instagram post and cites a sister who’s a cardiac ICU nurse. ""The consensus was not that +cases don’t exist, but that the numbers are exaggerated,"" reads text in the screenshot. In each iteration of the post, the one clear theme is that every test comes back positive. But that belies the actual numbers hospitals and health departments are reporting. According to data compiled by the COVID Tracking Project, the rate of positive coronavirus tests has never exceeded 21.9% (that was in early April). The positivity testing rate hit a low of 4.4% in mid-June. Currently, it’s around 7%. That means 93% of tests produce negative results.  These recent posts were not created in a vacuum. Similar rumors have circulated recently in India and Turkey. And conspiracy theories that claim officials are falsifying coronavirus test results — or that the pandemic itself is fabricated — have been circulating online for months. In late March, a website called the Cabal Times wrote about a video from a Swedish YouTuber who goes by the name Zakleo Se Bumbar. The video spins an elaborate conspiracy theory that asserts false-positive COVID-19 tests are driving the bulk of new cases. The Facebook post claims that labs are manipulating coronavirus tests to create false-positive results. We could find no evidence to back that up. Sebelia, the source of the claim, said it was a ""word-of-mouth story"" from his mom without proof. Similarly inaccurate or unproven claims about coronavirus tests have been circulating for weeks, many of which echo months-old conspiracy theories about the pandemic. While COVID-19 tests may sometimes produce false-positive results, there is no evidence that labs are deliberately manipulating samples. Experts are more concerned about false-negatives, which could pose health consequences. The Facebook post is inaccurate. We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C165A40>],/factchecks/2020/jul/02/facebook-posts/fact-checking-claims-about-nurses-getting-nothing-/

No, Oklahoma didn’t have 100% COVID-positive test rate after Trump’s Tulsa rally
","President Donald Trump’s campaign rally in Tulsa, Okla., was notable for being his first since the start of the coronavirus pandemic and nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, and for attracting far fewer people than expected. But the June 20 indoor rally, where many attendees did not wear masks, did not lead to a 100% test rate for COVID-19, as a headline briefly claimed. This was the original headline on a PoliticusUSA.com article on June 29: ""Oklahoma 100% coronavirus test rate after Trump Tulsa rally."" The original post — shared more than 253,000 times, according to PoliticusUSA — was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The article quoted MSNBC talk show host Chris Hayes as saying on June 29:  ""Yesterday in Oklahoma, they tested 352 people for the coronavirus, and every single test came back positive. Today they tested another 178 people, and all those tests came back positive, too. ""If you can’t do the math in your head, that's a 100% positive rate."" But three days later, on July 2, the website revised the article and replaced the original headline with this:  ""Correction: MSNBC’s Chris Hayes Misinterpreted Oklahoma Virus Test Data."" The revised article quotes Hayes as correcting himself.  Here’s what Hayes said on his show, per a July 2 tweet from the show:  ""On Monday, I said that in Oklahoma, authorities tested 352 people for coronavirus over the weekend and found every test positive. They then tested another 178 people and found them all positive, as well. I was so incredulous over those numbers, I even checked the website of the Oklahoma State Department of Health to confirm those numbers before we went on air. Indeed, that is what is on the official website. We weren’t wrong. That’s what they report. The problem is, there is a lag in the way that Oklahoma reports its data. With fewer, but almost entirely positive tests being reported on the weekends, and then larger numbers, including negative tests bulk-reported later in the week. So, those numbers I cited on Monday did not provide a clear or complete picture because they were not the final numbers for Oklahoma’s weekend testing. I have a cardinal rule that I violated there, that if a statistic sounds too wild to be true, it probably is. I’m going to remind myself of that in the future."" Oklahoma City TV reporter Dillon Richards had already knocked down the original article, tweeting: ""Not only are these dates incorrect (this is referring to Sunday and Monday) ... Oklahoma generally doesn't report negative tests on Sundays and Mondays, so the rate always appears to be 100% when it really isn't."" We rate the original post False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C179940>],/factchecks/2020/jul/02/facebook-posts/no-oklahoma-didnt-have-100-covid-positive-test-rat/

No, Taylor Swift didn’t say we should remove the Statue of Liberty
","Taylor Swift has taken a public stance in support of removing Confederate monuments in her home state of Tennessee. But has the popular singer-songwriter also advocated taking down the Statue of Liberty?  No. But that’s not what a falsified image being passed around on Facebook would have you to believe: ""Taylor Swift says we should remove The Statue Of Liberty,"" reads what looks like a headline in a screengrab of a news story dated June 18, 2020. Below the supposed headline, a blurb with a typo reads, ""How can you have a moment to freedom that was built by slaves. Racist monuments make me sick."" The Facebook post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The design of the post — which includes a banner with a ""G1"" logo and the word ""World"" — appears to imitate the design of an article from the Brazilian site globo, the website associated with the Brazilian television network Globo. G1 is the name of the news portal for the site. The site is real, but there weren’t any articles posted about Swift on June 18. We did a Google search of the headline in the image and narrowed it down to articles posted on June 18, but the search turned up nothing. Another Google search of the headline alone also produced no results. We did the same thing in Nexis, which holds news archives, and nothing came up. We do know that in a June 12 tweet, Swift called for the removal of statues that honor Confederate leaders and other historical figures: ""As a Tennessean, it makes me sick that there are monuments standing in our state that celebrate racist historical figures who did evil things. Edward Carmack and Nathan Bedford Forrest were DESPICABLE figures in our state history and should be treated as such,"" Swift said. Carmack was a white politician and newspaperman who in 1892 incited a mob that destroyed the newspaper office where investigative journalist Ida B. Wells worked. A statue of Carmack resided at the Tennessee State Capitol for over 90 years, before recently being toppled at a demonstration in Nashville. Wells, who was African American, was posthumously awarded a 2020 Pulitzer Prize for her work chronicling ""horrific and vicious violence against African Americans during the era of lynching."" Forrest was a Confederate general and the Ku Klux Klan’s first grand wizard. The Tennessee State Capitol holds a bust of Forrest, and the Tennessee Capitol Commission is expected to vote on whether to remove it from the building in July. A Facebook post circulating on the internet has a headline that reads, ""Taylor Swift says we should remove the Statue Of Liberty."" There is no evidence Taylor Swift has stated support for removal of the Statue of Liberty. A search of news archives and Google surfaced no article like the one that this Facebook post purports to show.
