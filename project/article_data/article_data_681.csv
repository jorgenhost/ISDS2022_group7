Has the state grown tax giveaways while cutting school resources?
","
For several years, Oregon has faced an economic crunch. Schools, social services and public safety have all taken cuts. In a recent newsletter, Our Oregon, a nonprofit backed by public employee unions, highlights those cuts and points to an alternative: Tax breaks.

Here’s what the newsletter says: ""The reason for this crisis is simple: As a state, we're not funding our schools at even an adequate level. And it's not that we don't have the resources, it's that we're choosing to give away the money through an ever-increasing list of tax breaks and loopholes.

Even while state leaders have cut funding for our schools and other basic priorities, the amount of money the state is projected to give away through tax breaks increased by a whopping $3.4 billion.""

PolitiFact Oregon has looked a lot at budgets. We say this again and again, but technically the state budget as a whole is not shrinking. It’s actually up about $400 million this biennium over last. But that growth isn’t enough to keep up with inflation and other factors. That means, even with budget increases, the state still has to make service cuts.

The state’s schools are seeing something similar happen. The State School Fund is up about $160 million this biennium over last and yet teachers are being laid off and class sizes are increasing.

We’re also no stranger to the issue of tax breaks. Previously we looked into whether the state spends more on giveaways than it does on education, public safety and health care combined. The answer: Mostly True.

Still, we wondered if lawmakers were really growing giveaways by the billions while cutting other programs.

We pulled out our copy of the state’s 2011-13 Tax Expenditure Report and on Page 5 we found the numbers we needed. We figured Our Oregon was talking about this biennium compared to last -- by that measure, they were right. In the 2009-11 biennium, the state granted nearly $28 billion in tax breaks. This biennium, the total is expected to hit $31.4 billion. That’s the $3.4 billion -- or 12 percent -- increase Our Oregon mentioned.

We confirmed with Our Oregon spokesman Scott Moore that those were the same numbers they looked at.

Fact checks, though, are never that easy. We wondered why this increase was happening, especially, as Our Oregon pointed out, during a time when other things are being cut.

We called the state’s economist Mark McMullen and asked him if he could explain some of the growth to us. ""A lot of these are just going to grow organically or just along with the economy,"" he said. Some of these are particularly big breaks, too. Say mortgage interest deductions or state income tax deductions. A good chunk also comes from the fact that Oregon is linked to the federal tax code.

That is all to say that lawmakers can’t cut these areas as easily as they can other spending. That doesn’t mean they don’t try. During the 2011 session, about 20 tax credits were set to expire and lawmakers opted to renew half of them -- or about $10 million worth. This is part of a recently instituted, six-year cycle in which all credits will get reviewed before being renewed.

We asked Moore whether he thought the group’s newsletter might have pointed that out. ""The sunsetting of the tax breaks that they embarked on in the last session is a good start,"" he said. ""It's wonderful that they're doing that ... but right now that only applies to tax credits.""

What’s more, he said, whether the growth happens with or without an explicit vote, the problem remains.

""We are automatically giving away money because we're connected to the federal tax code,"" he said. ""Rather than just throwing up their hands and just allowing us to be connected to the federal tax code (they should ask) ‘Does this make sense for the state of Oregon?’""

Our Oregon said in a newsletter that the state is projected to give away $3.4 billion more in tax breaks this biennium than the last, even as lawmakers make cuts in education and other programs. Education budgets have definitely seen service cuts -- though the actual state education budget has grown. Our Oregon’s math is right, but we think it’s important context that the increase isn’t all a result of legislators passing new giveaways and that other budgets haven’t shrunk so much as failed to keep up with growth.

We rate this claim Mostly True.","[('\nState of Oregon, 2011-13 Tax Expenditure Report\n\nInterview with Our Oregon spokesman Scott Moore, July 3, 2012\n\nInterview with Mark McMullen, Oregon’s state economist, July 3, 2012\n\nInterview with Chris Allanach, senior economist with Legislative Revenue Office, July 3, 2012\n\nOur Oregon newsletter, June 20, 2012', 'https://www.oregon.gov/dor/STATS/docs/ExpR11-13/tax-expenditure-report-2011-2013.pdf?ga=t')]",/factchecks/2012/jul/06/our-oregon/has-state-left-tax-giveaways-grow-while-cutting-sc/
"['National', 'Health Care', 'Nancy Pelosi']","
Nancy Pelosi says 'everybody' will get more and pay less under the health care law
","In the debate over health care reform, a central question is whether the Affordable Care Act will live up to its name and make health insurance more affordable. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif, said on Meet the Press that she welcomes the debate over repealing the law that Republicans promise.  

""They will ask for repeal,"" Pelosi said.""Repeal of all the things I said that help children, help young adults, help seniors, help men or women who may have prostate cancer, breast cancer, whatever it is, any precondition.  And everybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.""

That last line is a bold statement, because ""everybody"" covers a lot of people. PolitiFact has looked at Republican allegations that the law is bad because it will drive up premiums for most people and found those statements False. Pelosi’s statement allows us to make an assessment of the opposite point -- the law is good because everyone will save money.

The Congressional Budget Office is designed to be the neutral analytic arm of Congress, and its study on how the ACA will affect insurance premiums is widely seen as the gold standard when it comes to projections. We called Pelosi’s office for background on her claim, and they pointed us to a CBO analysis of the law.

Pelosi’s staff highlighted part of the report that states that for people who buy insurance on their own -- the individual market as it’s called -- rates will be 7 to 10 percent lower. Rates for those in the ""small group"" market will be 1 to 4 percent lower; and there will be little appreciable change for those in the ""large group"" market.

That sounds like everyone either wins or is held harmless, but those numbers come with two important caveats. First, they are averages, and the personal experience of individuals within each group could be very different. This is just basic math. If my premium goes up 10 percent and yours goes down 10 percent, the average change is zero, but that doesn’t make my insurance more affordable to me.

Second, the CBO did this section of its analysis assuming that people would buy the same kind of insurance they do today, without the new law. So if they have a $5,000 deductible and limited coverage today, the CBO analysts compared that to the rate they would pay in 2016 to get that same coverage under the law.

But in its study, the CBO number crunchers actually predict that a large number of people will want to buy better insurance. They would opt for a lower deductible, lower co-pays and a wider range of benefits. That personal choice would cause their total premiums to rise some 27 to 30 percent. For a policy covering just one person, the difference would be about $600 a year, before accounting for any of the subsidies the law provides; over half the people in the individual market would qualify for those subsidies.

Ed Haislmaier, a Senior Research Fellow at the Heritage Foundation, a group that opposes the health care law, said he thinks the CBO rightly factored in how people might respond when they see what the law offers. Haislmaier said the law will make rates ""artificially"" low. When buyers see a discount, they increase their spending.

""It’s like the store that sells jeans and has a sale with 50 percent off the second pair,"" Haislmaier said. ""You end up buying two pairs.""

Haislmaier predicts that people over age 50 with some health issues will be the first to trade up and buy a more expensive plan because they would figure they’re likely to use it.

Whatever the reasons, the CBO study estimates that 17 percent of people with insurance will see an average increase in premiums of about 10 percent. Of that group, more than half will see subsidies that will lower their costs considerably, and those people will pay less than they would today.

That still leaves roughly 8 percent of people with insurance paying more.

That is a national estimate. There have been a number of studies at the state level. One in Minnesota was done by team that included MIT economist, Jonathan Gruber. Gruber helped design the near-universal coverage program in Massachusetts under Mitt Romney and was a paid consultant for the Obama administration when the health law was being crafted.

On average, in Minnesota, the great majority of people would come out ahead and spend less for their health insurance. Nearly 300,000 people would have health insurance who did not have it before. But still, rates would go up for about 100,000 Minnesotans -- slightly less than 3 percent of the total.

These numbers might be on the mark or they might fall wide. Gruber describes the new law as ""transformative legislation that will reshape the U.S. health care system for decades."" And he says accurate predictions are ""very difficult"".

But every analysis in every state finds that some people will pay more.

Our ruling

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said ""Everybody will have lower rates, better quality and better access.""

But even the study that Pelosi’s staff cited as the source of that statement suggested that some people would pay more for health insurance. Analysis at the state level found the same thing.

The general understanding of the word ""everybody"" is every person. The predictions don’t back that up. We rule this statement False.","[('CQ Transcript, Meet the Press, July 1, 2012, accessed July 2, 2012\n\nCongressional Budget Office, ""An Analysis of Health Insurance Premiums Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,"" Nov. 30, 2009, accessed July 2, 2012\n\nInterview with Ed Haislmaier, senior researcher, Heritage Foundation, July 5, 2012\n\nMilliman,\xa0 ACA Impact on Premium Rates in the Individual and Small Group Markets - Indiana, Paul Houchins, June 2011, accessed July 3, 2012\n\nMinnesota Health Care Reform Task Force, Gruber and Gorman Analysis of ACA and Exchange Impact on Minnesota, February 2, 2012, accessed July 3, 2012\n\nThe Minnesota Basic Health Plan, Minnesota Budget Project, accessed July 2, 2012\n\nThe Daily Caller, Obamacare architect: Expect steep increase in health care premiums, Myles Miller, February 11, 2012, accessed July 2, 2012\n\nThe Incidental Economist, Debunking conservative use of Gruber, Harold Pollack, February 25, 2012, accessed July 2, 2012\n\nCommonwealth Fund, Commonwealth fund analysis of affordability, Gruber, April 2011, accessed July 3, 2012\n\nNational Bureau of Economic Research, The Impacts of the Affordable Care Act: How Reasonable are the Projections?, Jonathan Gruber, June, 2011, accessed July 2, 2012\n\nEmail interview, Jonathan Gruber, July 3, 2012\n\nForbes, How Obamacare Dramatically Increases the Cost of Insurance for Young Workers, Avik Roy, March 22, 2012, accessed July 2, 2012', 'https://cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/ftpdocs/107xx/doc10781/11-30-premiums.pdf')]",/factchecks/2012/jul/06/nancy-pelosi/nancy-pelosi-says-everybody-will-get-more-and-pay-/

Rick Scott says health insurance premiums will increase under health care law
","
Add this to the list of qualms Florida Gov. Rick Scott has with the nation’s health care law.

He says it will lead to increased premiums.

How? Through the part of the law that creates an online marketplace for individuals who do not receive insurance from their employers. Known as a health exchange, the idea is consumers can compare plans to get the best deal.

After the Supreme Court upheld the law, Scott announced he would not to set up the required exchanges, which means the federal government will step in to do it.

Scott -- who built his fortune running the nation’s largest hospital chain and his political cred leading an attack group opposed to health reforms -- says these exchanges ""don’t work"" and will lead to bigger bills for families. 
""If it was such a great idea the private sector would do it,"" Scott said on Fox News on July 2. ""And we know the Congressional Budget Office said if you’re going to buy your own policy with these exchanges you’ll be paying 10 percent more, or a family will. So about $2,100 more for a family. So you’re going to pay more with these exchanges.""

We’re familiar with Scott’s comments, which have roots in this 2009 report from the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan research agency.

Origins of this talking point

The CBO report, produced Nov. 30, 2009, examined how the law would affect health care premiums for people who purchase insurance through an employer-based group market (both large and small businesses) and for individuals.

As Scott said, CBO expected the average premium per person in new individual policies would rise 10 percent to 13 percent in 2016 compared with where it was before the law took effect.

In this market, average premiums per policy in this market would be about $5,800 for single policies (a $300 increase) and $15,200 for families (a $2,100 increase -- just like Scott said), according to CBO (pages 5 and 6).

If only the report ended there.

Subsidies and expanded coverage

More than half the 32 million people expected to seek their own coverage in 2016 (57 percent) would be eligible for subsidies that would reduce their premiums by 50 to 60 percent, the CBO said. (The subsidies are to be allocated according to a fee schedule that links a person’s income with the federal poverty level.) 
Scott’s comments also don’t account for an important change with these individual policies.

People will pay more, but it will be for a bigger swath of benefits. The law requires insurance companies to offer an ""essential health benefits"" package that would mirror benefits people get through employer plans.

These new policies have to cover services such as maternity care, prescription drugs, and treatment for mental and substance abuse.

In an ""apples to apples"" comparison, CBO found that premiums for new ""essential health benefits"" packages would actually be 7 to 10 percent less than equivalent insurance under the old law.

A small market

Scott was specific when he described who would be affected by CBO’s projections. But he didn’t include an important qualifier: People purchasing their own health insurance comprise less than one-fifth of the market.

According to CBO, people in the individual market could make up about 17 percent of the insurance market in 2016.

The biggest share, about 70 percent of the market, belongs to people who receive coverage in the large-group market. Health insurance premiums for the 134 million people in this larger, employer-based classification could decrease by zero to 3 percent in 2016.

As for the small group market, which is comprised of businesses with 50 or fewer workers, their premiums would stay mostly the same, either increasing 1 percent or dropping 2 percent. 
Our ruling 
Scott said that the Congressional Budget Office said people would pay 10 percent more for policies on the exchange, ""so about $2,100 more for a family."" What he doesn’t say is that these policies will have to offer comprehensive coverage. So people will pay more, but they’re also get more benefits. Additionally, the federal government will offer subsidies to many of these people to cut the cost. 
It’s also important to remember the CBO’s ""apples-to-apples"" comparison. According to the agency, people in the individual market will actually pay less for the required amount of benefits under the Affordable Care Act than they would for those same benefits under old policies.

We rate Scott’s statement Mostly False.","[('\nFox News, Florida refusing to implement part of health care reform law, July 2, 2012', 'http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/americas-newsroom/index.html#/v/1716596847001/florida-refusing-to-implement-part-of-health-care-law/?playlist_id=86909'), ('\nCongressional Budget Office, ""An Analysis of Health Insurance Premiums Under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act,"" Nov. 30, 2009\n\nPolitiFact.com, ""Obama says under Democratic health plan, family insurance premiums in the individual market would decrease 14 to 20 percent,"" Feb. 25, 2010\n\nPolitiFact.com, ""Rep.

Bob McDonnell says Supreme Court ruling on health care left Medicaid mandate intact
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell joined the list of disappointed Republican leaders who took to airwaves in the hours after the U.S. Supreme Court upheld most of President Obama’s health care law.

McDonnell, the chairman of the Republican Governors Association, said the court’s ruling does not mean the law is good policy.  Then he ripped at a provision that will greatly widen the Medicaid program for low-income and disabled people. McDonnell said the expansion will strain state budgets.

""I tell you what it means for Virginia -- $2.2 billion of an unfunded mandate in Medicaid expansion over the next decade,"" McDonnell said in an interview on MSNBC on June 28, the day the Supreme Court issued its ruling.

McDonnell repeated his statement on June 29 -- the day after the court decision -- during a CNN interview with Soledad O’Brien. He said as a result of the ruling, a ""$2.2 billion unfunded mandate falls on Virginia.""

""Medicaid is growing incredibly fast as a part of the budget. Now this is $2.2 billion on Virginia,"" the governor said.

Late in the afternoon of June 29, McDonnell appeared on Fox News and referred to the health care law as ""a cumbersome, unfunded mandate that will cost my state $2.2 billion in the next 10 years by this incredible expansion of Medicaid that has already busted the budget."" 
McDonnell’s mandate claims are striking because, even at the time of his first utterance, it was being widely reported that the court ruling overturned a provision in the law that required states to expand Medicaid. We initially thought the governor misspoke. But when McDonnell twice repeated his statement on national television the next day, we decided to examine his claim that the health care law still subjects states to a Medicaid mandate.

The Supreme Court, in a 5-4 ruling, upheld the major provision of the health care law that will require most people to buy medical insurance or pay a tax penalty.

The law also calls for expanding Medicaid by covering adults and families with incomes up to 133 percent of the federal poverty level, starting in 2014. The court struck down a provision that allowed the federal government to revoke its matching Medicaid funds to a state that refused to take part in the expansion.

Chief Justice John Roberts wrote on page 58 of the ruling: ""As for the Medicaid expansion, that portion of the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution by threatening existing Medicaid funding. Congress has no authority to order the states to regulate according to its instructions. Congress may offer the states grants and require the states to comply with accompanying conditions, but the states must have a genuine choice whether to accept the offer.""

Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, in a written statement released several hours after the Supreme Court decision, concluded that the Medicaid mandate had been voided. He called it a ""silver lining"" in a disappointing ruling.  

""The court blocked the federal government from withholding Medicaid dollars that states receive under the current Medicaid program if those states do not want to participate in the new and costly program expansions mandated under the health care law,"" Cuccinelli wrote. ""This alone could save the commonwealth about $200 million a year...""

Timothy S. Jost, a law professor at Washington & Lee University, had a similar take during an interview the day after the high court ruling.

""The Supreme Court expressly said if Virginia doesn’t want to participate in the Medicaid expansion, it does not have to,"" Jost told us.

We asked the governor’s office how McDonnell justified his claim that the ruling means a $2.2 billion mandate for Virginia.

Jeff Caldwell, a McDonnell spokesman, cited a 2010 report by the Virginia House Appropriations Committee staff estimating it would cost the state between $1.5 billion and $2.2 billion to cover Medicaid expansion through fiscal 2022.  

""As you know, the Supreme Court’s ruling places some uncertainty in this issue by removing the mandate"" for Medicaid, Caldwell said in an email.

In other words, the administration is acknowledging that -- contrary to McDonnell’s statements -- the Medicaid mandate is void.

One final note: The federal government will pay for the vast bulk of the expansion costs for states, covering 100 percent of the tab from the 2014 through 2016 fiscal years. Starting in 2017, the federal share gradually goes down to 90 percent by the 2021 fiscal year. That’s still a better deal than the 50 percent federal Medicaid match now offered to Virginia.

Our ruling

After the Supreme Court’s ruling on the health care act, McDonnell repeatedly said states still face a ""mandate"" to take part in Medicaid expansion provisions in the law.

Actually, the court’s ruling had the opposite effect. It took away Washington’s ability to punish states that don’t take part in the expansion by eliminating their federal Medicaid subsidies. The court ruled states must have ""a genuine choice"" whether to take part in the expansion.

It is perplexing that McDonnell --  a lawyer for 23 years who served as Virginia’s attorney general and now commands a knowledgeable gubernatorial staff -- would repeatedly misrepresent a major part of a landmark decision by the U.S. Supreme Court. Thirty hours after the ruling, McDonnell maintained on national TV that the Medicaid mandate was intact.

Wisconsin Rep. Robin Vos says voter fraud accounted for a portion of Lehman’s victory margin over Wanggaard in Senate recall
","
The balance of power in the state Senate is poised to flip from Republicans to Democrats after voters in the 21st Senate District chose Democrat John Lehman over first-term Sen. Van Wanggaard, R-Racine.

Lehman’s margin of victory -- 819 votes out of 71,897 cast -- was confirmed July 2, 2012 after a recount. Lehman’s victory gives Senate Democrats a 17-16 seat majority -- at least until the November elections.

In the days following the vote, Republican leaders noted that Wangaard received 49.4 percent of the votes cast in the Senate district, while Republican Gov. Scott Walker racked up 51.04 percent. (The results showed that Wanggaard received 2,689 fewer votes than Walker, while Lehman got 310 fewer votes than Barrett suggesting that Democrats were more prone to vote for their party’s Senate candidate than the Republicans in that election.)

The Wanggaard campaign is considering a court challenge based on issues found during the recount. The problems identified included a variety of complaints from poll workers and election materials that were found in a garbage bin.

The idea that the election results were tainted was advanced most aggressively by state Rep. Robin Vos, R-Rochester, whose Assembly district is part of the 21st Senate District. He offered his views June 17, 2012 on WISN-TV (Channel 12)  ""Upfront with Mike Gousha.""

""Unfortunately, a portion of (the vote) was fraud,"" Vos said, adding ""I’m not sure the entire 800 vote margin was...""

Gousha interrupted and asked Vos if he could make the statement about fraud ""with certainty.""

""I can, a portion,"" Vos said. ""Yeah, I do believe that.""

When we asked Vos to back up his claim, he noted that the Racine County Sheriff’s Department is investigating two election-related issues -- election registration documents found in a dumpster, and complaints by a poll worker at one polling place. And he said he heard second hand that someone tried to use a Bed Bath and Beyond mailer as proof of address.

""Is that fraud? I don’t know. It isn’t right and it seems fraudulent,"" he said. ""You tell me how that’s not a fraudulent vote.""

""I did not personally witness any voter fraud,"" Vos said. ""But some portion of what happened could be classified as fraud.""

We’re on thin ice already. He told us that there ""could"" be fraud involved in the vote. Yet Vos told Gousha and  ""Upfront"" viewers that he could say with ""certainty"" that there was voter fraud. He offers no specific examples, other than the fact that the sheriff’s department is looking into election-related complaints.

""We’re looking at a whole bunch of reports,"" Sheriff’s Department Lt. Steve Sikora told us. ""It’s not voter fraud, it’s irregularities.""

Sikora said that once the reports were completed, the department would turn its findings over to the Racine County clerk and the district attorney’s office, since there has been so much public interest in it. As of July 3, 2012, no case has been turned over for prosecution of voter fraud.

Because it was expected to be a tight race, the election was monitored by a large number of poll watchers from both political parties.

And there have been claims of problems from both sides. Democrats and Racine Mayor John Dickert have complained that Republican poll-watchers broke the rules and intimidated voters.

Meanwhile, the Mount Pleasant Patch.com site and the Racine Journal Times have reported that there were problems with voters who registered on the day of the election allegedly not signing poll books.

However, the Journal Times reported June 26, 2012, that the book signing issue was considered an administrative mistake by the state Government Accountability Board and that the votes would be counted.

GAB spokesman Reid Magney said that it was up to local law enforcement to determine if there were any violations of state election law.

Regardless, none of these incidents -- at least so far -- appears to fall into the category of voter fraud. And certainly there has been no evidence that voting irregularities were significant enough to tilt the balance in Lehman’s favor.

Conservative blogger Christian Schneider noted this in a June 26, 2012, post on his blog The Yankee Review, published on JSOnline.com.

""The fact that new registrants were not required to sign log books isn't in itself proof of vote fraud.  If one were dedicated enough to get on a bus and head down to cast a fraudulent vote, presumably they wouldn't have a problem scratching out an illegible signature on a log book.""

Even Wanggaard, in a July 2, 2012, statement issued after the recall was completed, stopped short of declaring that it was fraud: ""Anyone who argues that this recount was a waste of time, or that we do not need voter ID, either wants to conceal these potential fraudulent activities or hasn’t been paying attention.""

Wanggaard campaign counsel Jonathan Strasburg went a bit further, saying the recount revealed that election officials ""used procedures that would make Fidel Castro blush.""

In the run-up to the June 5, 2012, recall, we examined a statement from Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, who said that because of voter fraud, GOP candidates ""need to do a point or two better"" to win statewide elections in Wisconsin.

Although past reports have found flaws, including cases of fraudulent voting in the city of Milwaukee, Priebus didn’t provide any information to support the specifics of his claim or the percentages cited. That’s one of our principles: It’s incumbent upon those making claims to be able to support them. We rated Priebus’ claim False.

Our rating

Vos said voter fraud provided ""a portion"" of the difference in Wanggaard’s loss in a critical state Senate recall election.

The Racine County Sheriff’s Department is investigating issues regarding election procedures and paperwork, but a top official told us they do not suspect fraud. What’s more, Vos acknowledges he has no direct evidence of fraud.

Mitt Romney says health care law's penalty is a tax
","
In the days following the Supreme Court’s decision on President Barack Obama’s health care law, supporters and critics of the law sparred over the question of whether or not the individual mandate was a tax.

In its 5-4 ruling upholding the mandate -- as well as most of the rest of the law itself -- the court concluded that the mandate to buy insurance was constitutional because of Congress’ taxing power.

Republicans who were dejected by the law being found constitutional found a silver lining in that determination, as they proceeded to attack Obama as a tax-raiser.

Meanwhile, both sides faced uncomfortable questions on whether the mandate was a tax. Critics of the law highlighted Obama’s shifting views of whether the mandate was a tax or a penalty (an issue we fact-checked here). On the other hand, Democrats noted that if the individual mandate was actually a tax, then Mitt Romney himself had also imposed a tax when he signed a health care law as governor of Massachusetts.

Initially, a senior Romney aide, Eric Fehrnstrom, told MSNBC that Romney ""has consistently described the mandate in Massachusetts as a penalty"" -- a position at odds with many other Republicans in the wake of the ruling. But then, Romney changed course in a July 4, 2012, interview with CBS News.

""Well, the Supreme Court has the final word,"" Romney said. ""And their final word is that Obamacare is a tax. So it's a tax.""

We thought Romney’s comment offered us an opportunity to clear the air on this question. Did the court rule that the individual mandate was a tax, or not?

We received comments from 15 constitutional law experts from across the ideological spectrum. We found a certain degree of consensus -- but also a wide range of opinions on whether Romney’s claim was worded accurately, particularly given the complexity of the court’s ruling.

What the court ruled

The court actually addressed two questions relevant to Romney’s claim. Before it could address whether the mandate itself was constitutional, the court had to look at another critical question -- whether a law called the Anti-Injunction Act prevented the challenge to the law from going forward in the first place.

What’s the Anti-Injunction Act? It says that no tax may be challenged in court before it takes effect. Instead, a tax can be challenged only after the government begins to enforce it, with the plaintiff seeking a refund for taxes already paid. Part of deciding whether the suit against the health care law could proceed to the merits depended on the court determining whether the individual mandate is a tax.

Ultimately, the court ruled that the individual mandate did not constitute a tax under the Anti-Injunction Act. But the story doesn’t end there. With that hurdle cleared, the court proceeded to the merits, ruling the individual mandate constitutional based on Congress’ taxing power.

This seeming contradiction about whether it was or was not a tax is at the root of much confusion. But experts we interviewed said the distinction makes sense legally. The Anti-Injunction Act is a law, while Congress’ taxing power is enshrined in the Constitution. Because of that, the majority opinion addressed the two definitions of ""tax"" differently.

Specifically, when addressing the Anti-Injunction Act, the court gave deference to Congress’ decision not to label the individual mandate a tax when it wrote the legislation. If Congress had wanted the law to be subject to the act, the majority concluded, it could have easily done so by calling it a tax -- but it didn’t. So the Anti-Injunction Act was no barrier to the suit proceeding.

However, when the court looked at whether the mandate was constitutional, it used a more expansive definition of the word ""tax"" -- one that includes provisions that are not explicitly labeled taxes, but act in similar ways.

In the decision, Chief Justice John Roberts explained the divergent conclusions by writing, ""It is of course true that the Act describes the payment as a ‘penalty,’ not a ‘tax.’ But while that label is fatal to the application of the Anti-Injunction Act … it does not determine whether the payment may be viewed as an exercise of Congress's taxing power. It is up to Congress whether to apply the Anti-Injunction Act to any particular statute, so it makes sense to be guided by Congress's choice of label on that question. That choice does not, however, control whether an exaction is within Congress's constitutional power to tax.""

Legal commentator Stuart Taylor Jr. described this distinction as requiring ""some fancy footwork,"" but he concluded that ""it’s justified by the principle that the broad constitutional power of Congress to levy taxes should govern when the issue is constitutional, whereas other factors -- including whether Congress labeled something a tax -- should govern when the issue involves a law.""

What legal experts said

Most of the legal experts we interviewed said Romney was on pretty safe legal ground. For instance:

• Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute: ""This is an easy one. The Supreme Court has said it’s a tax, so it’s a tax. I disagree with the Supreme Court on that point, but the Constitution says that the court’s opinion trumps mine and anyone else’s.""

• University of California-Davis law professor Vikram Amar: ""The court said the mandate provision fell within Congress' powers to lay and collect taxes, duties … and excises -- i.e., that it fell within the federal government's power to raise revenue. It is thus a tax for purposes of how the Constitution defines a tax. And that word from the court means that no legal challenge to it on the ground that Congress lacked power to enact it will succeed.""

• Yale Law School professor Jack Balkin: ""The Supreme Court held that the mandate is constitutional under the taxing power because it functions as a tax, regardless of what Congress calls it.""

Even so, we heard one main criticism from our experts -- that Romney went too far when he said that the Supreme Court ruled that the mandate is a tax. Several legal scholars told us that the court ruled that the mandate acts like a tax, or is analogous to one, but not that it is one -- a small linguistic distinction, but an important legal one.

""The Supreme Court did not say, ‘It's a tax,’ but rather, ‘It does not matter if it was called a tax, because Congress could have done this in the form of a tax, which it is permitted to do,’ "" said George Washington University law professor Neil Buchanan, who blogged about the decision.

As evidence, Buchanan pointed to several passages in Roberts’ ruling. For instance, Roberts wrote that the payment for not having insurance ""may for constitutional purposes be considered a tax, not a penalty."" Buchanan noted Roberts’ use of the restrictive phrase ""for constitutional purposes."" Buchanan noted that Roberts at one point also distinguished between interpreting something to be a tax for constitutional purposes and imposing a tax.

It’s also worth pointing out that in two of Roberts’ key concluding paragraphs, he wrote that the act’s ""requirement that certain individuals pay a financial penalty for not obtaining health insurance may reasonably be characterized as a tax,"" and that ""it is reasonable to construe what Congress has done as increasing taxes on those who have a certain amount of income, but choose to go without health insurance. Such legislation is within Congress's power to tax.""

Guy-Uriel Charles, a Duke University law professor, was one of several experts who agreed with Buchanan that the Supreme Court did not technically label the provision a tax. ""The Court said that the mandate is consistent with Congress' exercise of the taxing power, which is different from saying that the mandate is a tax,"" Charles said.

""What Romney said is accurate on the political level, but not on the legal level,"" said Steven Schwinn, a law professor at John Marshall Law School in Chicago.

Our ruling

Romney said, ""The Supreme Court has the final word. And their final word is that Obamacare is a tax. So it's a tax."" If you put Romney’s comment under a legal microscope, there’s a strong case that he’s cut some rhetorical corners. The Supreme Court found the law constitutional based on Congress’ taxing authority, but nowhere in the opinion did Roberts say that the individual mandate actually was a tax -- only that it ""may reasonably be characterized as a tax"" and that ""it is reasonable to construe"" it as a tax.

Still, PolitiFact focuses on political speech, rather than legal speech, and judged by that standard Romney is pretty close to accurate.

"['Oregon', 'County Budget', 'County Government', 'Elections', 'Taxes', 'Clackamas County Democrats']","
Will passage of light-rail ballot measure in Clackamas County increase taxes?
","
Clackamas County residents will vote Sept. 18 on a measure that, if approved, will require county officials to get voter approval before spending county resources for ""financing, design, construction, or operation of any public rail transit system."" Yes, that means MAX.

Conservatives tend to back Measure 3-401 as a way to hip-check county commissioners who make spending decisions. In response, Clackamas County Democrats issued a statement saying they would fight the measure. The statement was published in the letters section of the Clackamas Review.  

Democrats argue that passage will stymie economic development, throttle local government and cost taxpayers money. Actually, it’s more than just costing more money -- the claim is that the measure will increase taxes: ""Let’s be very clear on 3-401. Its passage will hurt our county, cripple economic growth, and increase our taxes with excessive special elections.  A ‘no’ vote is sensible and reasonable.""

Who wants higher taxes for more elections? Nobody, right? Or was this just a scare tactic by Democrats?

PolitiFact Oregon recalled a similar argument when a similar issue was on the ballot in Clackamas County last year. Supporters of one urban renewal ballot measure tried to scare voters away from a competing ballot measure by arguing that countywide elections would cost ""a fortune"" compared with geographically limited elections. We ruled that statement False because adding a voter question to a primary or general election doesn’t really cost the elections division extra.  

We acknowledge that this is a different situation. If voters approve Measure 3-401, future questions about light-rail related decisions will need to go to voters during any one of four authorized regular elections every year. Again, it doesn’t cost much money, if anything, to add a question to a primary or general election.

But it will cost money if it’s the only issue on a ballot -- and the election is held just to address that one question. Want an example? Measure 3-401 is the only issue on the Sept. 18  ballot. Steve Kindred, county elections manager, estimates the election could cost around $125,000. That’s real money.

But the claim is that the ballot measure will ""increase our taxes with excessive special elections."" Will it?

The answer is no. There is no special tax for elections. County residents pay property taxes, which grow at a predetermined rate, and the money pays for various county agencies, including elections. Kindred checked with staff and said nobody there can recall a time when the tax base was raised to cover the cost of additional elections.

Just to be on the super safe side, we checked with the county assessor, Bob Vroman. He, too, said that more elections do not translate into higher taxes.

Before we rule, we should include what the spokesman for the Clackamas County Democrats said when we put the tax-raising question to him. Remember, this is a statement that went to media outlets and elected officials. It was published in the Clackamas Review.

""Special elections cost money, that’s all it means,"" said Peter Toll. He added, ""The county is compelled to run an election at our expense. It’s going to cost tax money.""

Well, then. So much for precision in language, or even giving voters accurate information.

Approving Measure 3-401 will not increase taxes. Elections cost taxpayer money, but the election may have been held anyway. Taxes in Clackamas County will go up, but for reasons outside the frequency of elections.

We rule the statement False.","[('\nClackamas Review, ""Local politicians need to build trust; Clackamas County Dems vote to oppose 3-401,"" Letters to the Editor, June 26, 2012\nInterview with Peter Toll, Clackamas County Democrats, June 26, 2012\nEmails from Peter Toll, June 25, July 3, 2012\nEmails from Steve Kindred, Clackamas County elections manager, June 25-26, 28, 2012\nInterview with Bob Vroman, Clackamas County tax assessor, July 3, 2012\nPolitiFact Oregon, ""Will a countywide vote on urban renewal cost taxpayers ""a fortune"" and an alternative backed by Clackamas County commissioners cost less?""

John Boehner says U.S. health care system is best in world
","
House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, says the health care law signed by President Barack Obama -- and upheld by the U.S. Supreme Court -- imperiled the nation’s health care system. 
""Gov. Romney understands that Obamacare will bankrupt our country and ruin the best health care delivery system in the world,"" Boehner said, during the July 1, 2012, edition of CBS’ Face the Nation. 
Boehner wasn’t the only one making that claim on the Sunday talk-show circuit. On Fox News Sunday, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., added that the U.S. has ""the finest health care system in the world."" 
A reader asked us to check whether there is any statistical evidence showing that the U.S. has ""the best health care delivery system in the world."" So we took a look. 
Boehner’s case 
When we asked Boehner’s office whether they had a particular study in mind, a spokesman acknowledged that there is no generally accepted measure for quality of care. However, they cited several narrower measures in which the U.S. scored well. 
For instance, the Commonwealth Fund rated the U.S. the best in four out of five preventive-care categories in 2004 when compared with four other advanced industrialized nations. Boehner’s office also cited data showing strong survival rates in the U.S. for patients with cancer when compared with other nations. 
Boehner’s office also noted that wealthy foreigners flock to the U.S. to receive care because of its cutting-edge facilities, and that the U.S. is among the leaders, if not No. 1, in medical research and pharmaceutical development. 
""As the speaker made clear, there are things we must do to improve the system we have, but there are many things that work well and Obamacare would only increase government involvement in patient care,"" spokesman Brendan Buck said. 
The U.S.: 37th in the world? 
But is there any data on the health-care system as a whole? There is, though it’s not perfect. 
We’ll start with a recap of our previous fact-check of the claim that the U.S. health care system ranks 37th in the world. The number refers to the World Health Organization's ranking of the United States as the 37th best health care system out of 191 countries. WHO, an arm of the United Nations, published the international comparison in its World Health Report 2000. 
We found that observers generally agreed on two things about the report. One, it was a landmark study that attracted a lot of attention around the world. And two, its conclusions have inspired intense controversy ever since it was released. 
Five factors went into WHO's calculation: 
• Health level, as defined by a measure of life expectancy, which shows how healthy a country's population is. This factor gets a 25 percent weight. 
• Responsiveness, which includes factors such as speed of health services, privacy protections, choice of doctors and quality of amenities. This factor gets a 12.5 percent weight. 
• Financial fairness, which measures how progressive or regressive the financing of a country's health care system is — that is, whether or not the financial burdens are borne by those who are economically better off. This factor receives a 25 percent weight. 
• Health distribution, which measures how equally a nation's health care resources are allocated among the population. This factor receives a 25 percent weight. 
• Responsiveness distribution, which measures how equally a nation's health care responsiveness (which we defined above) is spread through society. This factor gets a 12.5 percent weight. 
Once these statistics were collected, the WHO combined them into two summary rankings. One, called ""overall attainment,"" is the basic weighted average of the five factors listed above. The other, called ""overall performance,"" took that number and adjusted it for how well a country's health system was doing compared to how well WHO's experts believed it should be doing based on education level and economic resources. 
Using the second of the two ratings — overall performance — the United States ranks 37th. France ranked first, with the list of nations ranking ahead of the U.S. including a mix of industrialized countries in Western Europe, Scandinavia and Asia; wealthy oil producers from the Middle East; tiny realms of prosperity such as Monaco and Luxembourg; and some seemingly unlikely nations such as Colombia, Cyprus, Morocco, Dominica and Costa Rica. 
Using the first factor — overall attainment — the United States does better, finishing 15th. 
Most observers broadly agree that two of the WHO's five measures — health level and responsiveness — are reasonable. The first statistic gauges health outcomes, which are obviously a health care system's No. 1 goal, and the second seeks to measure how well a health system works when interacting with patients, another widely agreed upon mission. 
But there is far less consensus over the other three factors. Concerns stem from a mix of methodology and ideology. 
For instance, some critics, many of them conservative, reject the assumption that the rich should pay a similar percentage of their income for health care as the poor do. They argue that basic mathematics suggests that those with smaller incomes will naturally spend a larger share on highly important items such as food and health care, doing well in WHO's rankings almost requires a steeply progressive tax structure. 
Other studies 
Another study that included a smaller number of nations found the U.S. health system’s performance to be mediocre. The third edition of a periodic study by the Commonwealth Fund found that ""compared with six other nations — Australia, Canada, Germany, the Netherlands, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom — the U.S. health care system ranks last or next-to-last on five dimensions of a high performance health system: quality, access, efficiency, equity, and healthy lives."" 
Meanwhile, this chart by National Geographic compares health care expenditures with health outcomes and frequency of doctor visits in 20 other nations. It shows that the U.S. is a major exception, combining extraordinarily high costs, mid-level outcomes and a low frequency of doctor visits. 
The U.S. system does a good job at some things, such as keeping down wait times. A study of five English-speaking countries found that in the U.S., only 5 percent of patients reported a wait longer than four months for surgery, compared to 23 percent in Australia, 26 percent in New Zealand, 27 percent in Canada, and 38 percent in the United Kingdom. 
But it does poorly in other ways -- particularly in having so many people uninsured. A paper published by Urban Institute scholars in 2009 noted that the U.S. was one of only three countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -- the group of advanced industrialized nations -- with a sizeable share of its population lacking coverage. The others were Mexico and Turkey. 
(A wide range of other international comparisons are linked to here, though most of them tackle different questions, such as spending on health care, than Boehner addressed in his Face the Nation comment.) 
Glen Whitman, a professor of economics at California State University at Northridge, has offered strong criticism of the WHO’s methodology in a paper for the libertarian Cato Institute. Still, he suggests that Boehner went too far with his claim. 
""The assertion that the U.S. is ‘the best’ across the board has little support -- as does the assertion that the U.S. is ‘the worst,’"" Whitman said. ""It's a mixed bag. We're better in some ways, worse in others -- and in many categories of potential comparison, there's just not good evidence available, so we have to remain agnostic. People who assert confidently that the U.S. health care system is simply ‘the best’ are probably doing so out of national pride."" 
Our ruling 
It’s true that specific aspects of the U.S. health care system are either the best or among the best in the world. But other aspects of the U.S. system fall short of what other advanced nations provide. Boehner’s claim that the United States has ""the best health care delivery system in the world"" is too glib to accurately characterize a much more nuanced reality. On balance, we rate his statement Half True.","[('\nJohn Boehner, interview with CBS’ Face the Nation, July 1, 2012', 'https://www.cbsnews.com/8301-3460_162-57464563/face-the-nation-transcripts-july-1-2012-speaker-boehner-senators-schumer-and-coburn-governors-walker-and-omalley/?pageNum=2&tag=contentMain;contentBody'), ('\nMitch McConnell, interview with Fox News Sunday, July 1, 2012', 'No link'), ('\nWorld Health Organization, World Health Report 2000: Health Systems, Improving Performance , published June 2000', 'http://www.foxnews.com/on-air/fox-news-sunday/2012/07/02/white-house-ready-move-and-implement-health-care-law-mcconnell-we-can-defeat-obamacare-no?page=4'), ('\nThe Commonwealth Fund, ""Mirror, Mirror on the Wall: How the Performance of the U.S. Health Care System Compares Internationally,"" 2010 Update', 'No link'), ('\nThe Commonwealth Fund, ""Percentage of Adults Who Received Recommended Preventive Care or Reminders, International Comparison, 2004""', 'http://www.who.int/whr/2000/en/whr00_en.pdf'), ('\nThe Commonwealth Fund, ""Comparison of Health Care System Views and Experiences in Five Nations: 2001 Findings from The Commonwealth Fund 2001 International Health Policy Survey,"" May 2002', 'No link'), ('\nUrban Institute, ""How Does the Quality of U.S. Health Care Compare Internationally?""

Connie Mack IV says cutting one penny out of every federal dollar would quickly balance the budget
","
U.S. Rep. Connie Mack IV faced accusations of using public money for campaigning when he sent an office mailer about his ""Penny Plan"" beyond his southwest Florida congressional district in May. Mack, R-Fort Myers, is running statewide for the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate.

Mack blamed the widespread mailing on the vendor who had also done campaign work for Mack. The vendor then reimbursed the government.

While who received the mailer drew much scrutiny, what the mailer actually said drew less attention.

Mack’s mailer was about a plan he introduced in May 2011 to balance the budget that he says is so basic it comes down to -- you guessed it -- a penny.

""The Mack Penny Plan is simple -- eliminate one penny out of every federal dollar spent,"" the mailer said. ""Doing this would balance our budget by 2019 and restore economic freedom by reducing spending and bringing fiscal discipline to Washington. The Penny Plan continues to gain support and now has 70 cosponsors in the House of Representatives, as well as support from key senators like Marco Rubio, Pat Toomey and Rand Paul. If Florida families can cut one penny, or more, out of every dollar in their budgets, so can Washington.""

We had a few questions about Mack’s plan:

• Does the math work -- would it balance the budget in eight years?

• How would Mack get to that 1 percent cut each year -- would it be across the board in every area, including Social Security and Medicare?

• Is it really gaining support? Or is it stalled?

By the numbers

Mack has a fact sheet that shows the numbers for H.R. 1848, the One Percent Spending Reduction Act.

Mack got the idea from the One Cent Solution. The founder, Bruce Cook, is a businessman from Georgia and a graduate of Harvard Business School.

The math works like this: For six years, the federal government would reduce spending by 1 percent each year. In the seventh year, funding would be capped at 18 percent of gross domestic product, which measures the size of the overall economy. By the eighth year, the plan would balance the budget and save $7.5 trillion over 10 years.

If Congress and the president couldn’t reach an agreement about what to cut, the plan would trigger automatic across-the-board spending cuts.

Mack’s website shows the 1 percent reduction each year:

FY 2012 – $3.382 trillion*, less 1 percent => $3.348 trillion cap
FY 2013 – $3.348 trillion, less 1 percentt = > $3.315 trillion cap
FY 2014 – $3.315 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.282 trillion cap
FY 2015 – $3.282 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.249 trillion cap
FY 2016 – $3.249 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.216 trillion cap
FY 2017 – $3.216 trillion, less 1 percent => $3.184 trillion cap

At the beginning of fiscal year 2018, it sets an overall spending cap of 18 percent of gross domestic product.

The mailer says the plan would balance the budget by 2019, while a Mack congressional staffer told us based on the latest figures it would do the trick by 2017.

To give you an idea of how dramatic this is, Paul Ryan’s budget plan wouldn’t balance the budget for nearly three decades, until 2040.

The math isn’t the hard part

We sent Mack’s fact sheet to several federal budget experts and asked them if the math worked and their opinion of Mack’s plan. Our experts included JD Foster of the conservative Heritage Foundation; Chris Edwards of the libertarian Cato Institute; Josh Gordon of the centrist Concord Coalition; Jason Peuquet of the centrist Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget; and Michael Linden, of the left-leaning Center for American Progress.

Our experts generally agreed that Mack’s math is correct and would balance the budget. But no one we interviewed thought Mack’s plan was a realistic way to balance the budget.

""One can always make the math work, as presented in this fashion it's a fairly straightforward exercise,"" Foster said.  

The straight math isn’t the hard part. It’s whether to cut everything by 1 percent or to target programs selectively.

""The numbers work, but they have to be made effective by policy changes,"" Foster said. ""The easiest part legislatively is the targets, and you have to have those, but then you still need to finish the job.""

Republicans have programs they want to protect from cuts, just like the Democrats do, and the GOP can end up fighting amongst themselves about what to cut -- take for example the battle over whether to extend the Export-Import Bank.

""There are a lot Republicans in the House and Senate who fashion themselves as being for small government and supporting these overall caps, but when the rubber hits the road and they actually have to vote on cutting particular programs, they chicken out,"" Edwards said.

Most notably, the bill doesn’t explain how it would adjust Medicare and Social Security to make up for the expected growth as Baby Boomers retire.

We asked Mack’s congressional office if Mack supports cutting peoples’ Social Security 1 percent a year for six years. Their statement:

""The Penny Plan sets a framework for reducing spending. It will be up to Congress and the president to work together to determine how best to achieve those spending reductions.""

(The One Cent Solution states that some programs could be spared while others cut more than others, so theoretically that could mean Social Security wouldn’t be cut though that would mean larger cuts elsewhere.)

Linden, who called Mack’s plan ""ridiculous"", noted that this plan could mean an even cut larger than 1 percent for each senior, since the number of seniors getting Social Security will increase. And if Social Security and Medicare were off the table, that would remove about 35 percent of non-interest spending from the chopping block, leaving bigger cuts elsewhere.

Most proposals to control spending account for the fact that more people are going to be getting Social Security and Medicare benefits in the future, Peuquet said. That means making actual cuts to the programs is very difficult.

The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities hasn’t analyzed the Penny Plan but examined a 2011 plan by Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., and Claire McCaskill, D-Mo., to limit total federal spending to no more than 20.6 percent of the gross domestic product -- slightly larger than Mack’s proposal of 18 percent. The Center wrote that the cuts to entitlements would be massive:

""There is little possibility that Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security all would be exempted from these cuts. To do that would require cutting everything else — including defense, veterans’ programs, education, scientific research, and the like — by unthinkable amounts.
...and the cuts would have to be even larger if the economy faltered.""

Social Security and Medicare aren’t the only programs that our experts raised concerns about.

Linden raised questions about whether Mack would cut veterans’ benefits although their needs are growing.

""You have to think not just compared to what we spend today, but what we have to spend based on underlying demographics,"" he said.

Gaining support?

Mack introduced his bill in the House on May 11, 2011. It was referred to committees and introduced in the Senate on June 30. Since then, it’s seen no official action, according to the Library of Congress website. All 70 cosponsors in the House signed on in 2011.

In the Senate, there is one sponsor plus 13 cosponsors and about half of the cosponsors signed on in 2012. Mack’s office also points to this April 2012 article in the conservative Washington Times cowritten by a Treasury official who worked under President George W. Bush. Mack also spoke about his plan at George Mason University’s Mercatus Center in April 2012.

We agree that the Penny Plan is still getting some attention, but even Mack’s own website largely links to endorsements and news coverage from 2011.

Our ruling

Mack’s plan calls for reducing federal spending 1 percent a year for six years and then capping spending at 18 percent of GDP. Our experts agreed that the math works to balance the budget.

But Mack has not provided a detailed road map on how to achieve cuts -- he simply says if Congress and the president can’t work it out, there will be across-the-board cuts, with no explanation about what that means for programs serving an increased number of people. We’d like to hear him provide details about whether older Americans should expect lower Social Security checks and to pay more for Medicare, or if they’ll be spared and in turn other departments will face much larger cuts.

And we don’t see evidence that the plan is gaining support. The lack of action in the Republican-controlled House of Representatives is a sign that balancing the budget requires broader policy discussions and debates about spending priorities.

Tommy Thompson says he ""fired"" Kathleen Falk by eliminating the state public intervenor's office
","
Republican U.S. Senate candidate Tommy Thompson made an extra effort to demonstrate his passion for property rights while addressing a tea party audience in Oconomowoc on June 4, 2012.

He talked up life on his 700-acre farm. He said as governor he ""took on the DNR"" -- the Department of Natural Resources -- and also took control of appointing the agency’s leader. He blasted ""Agenda 21,"" the United Nations environmental program.

And, with a touch of glee in his voice, he recounted how as governor he got rid of Kathleen Falk as a public intervenor, a position in the state Attorney General’s office that served as a sort of watchdog in environmental disputes.

Falk, a Democrat appointed to the position by Attorney General Bronson La Follette, later was elected four times as Dane County executive. She lost races for governor in 2002, attorney general in 2006 and governor again in the 2012 recall primary.

""Who had the guts to take away the public intervenor in this state?"" Thompson said at a meeting of the Lake Country Area Defenders of Liberty.

""I got rid of Kathleen Falk!"" he added, to big laughs in the crowd. ""I was the first one to fire Kathleen Falk!""

Did then-Governor Thompson eliminate the public intervenor’s office, getting ""rid"" of Falk and becoming the ""first to fire"" her?

Let’s roll back the clock.

The issue arose in 1995, when Thompson -- then in his third term as governor -- sought to eliminate the public intervenor’s office in his two-year budget.

""It’s a law office hired by the state to sue us,"" Thompson complained at the time. He considered the intervenors ""state-financed lawyers for the environmental movement.""

Proponents said the office saved the state money by solving problems and heading off lawsuits by environmental groups.

The office was created in 1969 by Gov. Warren Knowles, a Republican, as an independent mediator to represent the public's interest in court and state agency decisions.

The intervenors were assistant attorneys who often sued other state agencies to register objections to plans for highway, dredging and mining projects.

When Thompson made his move, two assistant attorneys general -- Falk and Thomas Dawson -- had full-time intervenor status. Both had served as intervenors under both Republican and Democratic attorneys general.

In his budget bill, Thompson proposed doing away with the intervenor’s office by wiping out the attorney general’s authority to appoint intervenors.

Although Republicans both chambers of the Legislature, the Senate passed a compromise abolishing one intervenor, and moving the other to the Thompson-controlled DNR with no power to sue.

Two years later, the Legislature and Thompson eliminated the DNR position, with Democrats saying it had little authority.

So Thompson can take credit for abolishing the office, which directly led to Falk losing the intervenor job.

But does that mean Thompson fired her?

Both Falk and Dawson stayed on as assistant attorneys general, just doing different assignments. Both positions were under the civil service system, so they could not lose their job by the stroke of Thompson’s pen.

Falk stayed in the office for about two years until she left in 1997 to become Dane County executive. Dawson is a staff attorney in the office. Though Falk and others campaigned in subsequent years for restoring the intervenor’s office, it was never brought back.

Thompson, of course, said he was the ""first"" to fire Falk.

His campaign said he meant that statewide voters had later rejected her. That rings hollow because she never lost a campaign while holding an office. How can you be ""fired"" from a job you don’t have?

Our rating

Thompson said he was the ""first to fire"" Falk by eliminating the environmental watchdog known as the state public intervenor’s office.

In making the remark, he did so in the context of abolishing the office, so he’s on target there.

In a colloquial sense, ""fired"" may fit because Thompson knew Falk would no longer be intervenor due to his actions. But he went too far in leaving the impression Falk was out on the street. And Falk was never removed from any other job we know of, so Thompson misfired with ""first to fire.""

Mitt Romney, Barack Obama in “margin-of-error race” according to most polls, says Chris Christie
","
Gov. Chris Christie said a narrow win for the national health care law in the U.S. Supreme Court helped boost President Barack Obama’s poll numbers over his Republican opponent for the moment. But, he said, the race for the White House is a statistical dead heat.

""If you look at most of the polls, this is a margin-of-error race on Fourth of July between Mitt Romney and the president,"" Christie, a top surrogate for Romney, said in an interview on CNBC’s Squawk Box on Tuesday.

""And if for any Republican, if I had told them in January, in the middle of the scrum between the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary with Mitt Romney getting beaten up by all those people on the stage, ‘Don't worry. On Fourth of July, it'll be a dead heat race between the president and Mitt Romney’ every Republican would have signed up for that. So let's keep everything in perspective. This is a margin-of-error race. It's going to be a close election. But I think Governor Romney is in [a] really good position right now as the challenger to be able to make the case over the next number of months that he can win,"" Christie said.

Are Obama and Romney facing off in a ""margin-of-error race,"" as Christie claims? PolitiFact New Jersey found most polls back up the governor.

We reviewed more than a dozen polls, conducted by different organizations, that asked respondents about who they would vote for in the 2012 presidential election. Only two of those polls found a difference between Obama and Romney that could not be impacted by the survey’s margin of error.

A July 2 report from Gallup found respondents split 48 percent in favor of Obama to 43 percent in favor of Romney. That poll had a margin of error of 2 percentage points, not enough to swing the results another way.  

Charles H. Franklin, professor of political science at the University of Wisconsin, Madison and co-founder of Pollster.com, said ""you can easily find some polls where the margin is within the margin of error and a few now and then that are outside the margin of error.""

But the fact that a poll falls outside of the survey’s sampling error ""doesn’t mean that poll was right,"" he said, citing a June 20 Bloomberg poll that found Obama 13 points ahead of Romney as an example.

Recent polls from CNN, Fox News, NBC News/Wall Street Journal, Pew Research and others, show a more narrow spread between Obama and Romney. Though almost all of those polls had the president ahead of his Republican challenger, the margins of error had the possibility of swinging the results in Romney’s favor.

A CNN/ORC International poll with a margin of error of 2.5 percentage points released July 2 found Obama ahead of Romney, 49 percent to 46 percent.

In a Fox News Poll released June 27, 45 percent of respondents said they’d vote for Obama and 40 percent said they vote for Romney if the election were held today. That survey had a sampling error of 3 percentage points.

""In general all the polls show Obama with a lead within the margin of error,"" said Peter Woolley, executive director of the PublicMind Poll at Fairleigh Dickinson University.

But, he said, ""I wouldn’t call that a dead heat. I think that’s an optimistic pronouncement. When you have poll after poll that puts Obama a little bit ahead then I would say that you’re pretty confident Obama is a little bit ahead.""

Our ruling

Christie said that  ""if you look at most of the polls, this is a margin-of-error race on Fourth of July between Mitt Romney and the president.""

PolitiFact New Jersey reviewed 13 recent polls from different organizations, nearly all of which put Obama ahead of Romney. Only two of those polls showed the president with a lead outside of the margin of error.

"['Pensions', 'State Budget', 'States', 'Wisconsin', '  AFSCME']","
Labor leader Marty Beil says state pension plan is ""self funded""
","
Gov. Scott Walker fueled fears in some state government workers about pension security when he initiated a study that public-sector unions saw as a step toward a 401(k)-style plan they see as less secure.

When the study came out July 2, 2012, it recommended against adding an optional ""defined contribution"" plan to the state pension system, and Walker said he was not ""currently"" planning ""substantial"" changes.

Some conservative critics have decried the guaranteed pensions in the current ""defined benefit"" plan, while defenders noted the best-in-the-nation fiscal health of the Wisconsin Retirement System.

On June 14, 2012 the state’s highest-profile public employee labor leader, Marty Beil, talked pensions during an appearance on the liberal ""Sly in the Morning"" radio show on Madison’s WTDY radio.

Beil, executive director of District Council 24 of the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME), said ""we have pensions here that are not out of line. We have pensions that don’t put huge amounts of economic burden on the taxpayers.""

Beil went on:  ""It’s really the employees’ money, and that has to be told, and has to be told to legislators, to neighbors and friends -- that this really is a self-funded pension plan. It’s the money of the workers’ that funds it.""

In 2010, the state pension system paid out some $3.9 billion.

That’s a lot of cash.

Is Beil right that the system is ""self funded"" by employee contributions and ""it’s the money of the workers that funds it?""

About the system

We started with data compiled by the state Department of Employee Trust Funds, which administers the retirement plan for 166,000 retirees and 260,000 active workers.

For 2010, the latest year available, revenues flowing into the pension fund totalled $9.78 billion -- 85 percent of which came from investment returns on the fund.

That’s pretty typical of the fund’s experience. Over the past decade, except for a couple years when stock market losses wiped out any revenue gain, investment income has averaged 76 percent of the annual revenue.

But what about all the money that generated the returns? When and where did it come from?

For 2010, nearly all of the remaining 15 percent came from the employers who are part of the fund -- the state, school districts and most local units of government, based on collective bargaining agreements.

But, wait, didn’t Walker limit collective bargaining and require the state and its employees to begin making identical contributions to the fund?

Yes, but that didn’t kick in until 2011, so it has had little impact on the sources of the $77 billion in the fund, and it had no impact on the fund as of 2010.

What’s relevant for this fact check is what the law was before Act 10.

Here’s the history on where contributions to the fund came from.

Dating to at least the 1940s, Wisconsin law has made both workers and the state responsible for contributing to the pension fund in amounts based on flat percentages or actuarial calculations related to keeping the fund healthy.

Indeed, the state’s books still show a cost-sharing arrangement.

But the statutes, since at least 1981, have allowed or dictated that the state cover some or all of the workers’ contributions in addition to the employer share. This was the era of collective bargaining.

And that’s what happened.

It became commonplace over a period of decades for almost all public employers -- the state, school districts, local governments -- to ""pick up"" the entire employee contribution.

So, looking simply at the numbers, it’s clear the vast majority of funds in the pension system are from investment returns and taxpayer-funded contributions by employers.

By that measure, Beil’s claim of a ""self funded"" pension system is way off the mark, given that few employees were making a direct contribution to the fund before 2011.

Another high-ranking AFSCME official in Wisconsin, Susan McMurray, a lobbyist with AFSCME Council 11, agreed that ""self funded"" is not an accurate description.

""It doesn’t really work like that,"" she said. ""It’s not a 401(k). It’s a different mechanism.""

Keith Brainard, research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, agreed: ""The pension is an important part of compensation, but to say the employer is not contributing to the cost, that’s not really defensible.""

More to the story

But that’s not the end of the story.

Pensions are an integral part of an employee’s compensation package. In effect, it is money set aside now to be available when the worker retires.

""It’s not like they’re giving it to us,"" said McMurray, who spoke for Beil.

This point of view was advocated during the original collective bargaining debate by financial journalist David Cay Johnston.

""The money the state ‘contributes’ is actually part of the compensation that has been negotiated with state workers in advance so it is their money that they choose to take as pension payments in the future rather than cash wages or other benefits today,"" Johnston wrote in a 2011 article for Tax.com.

Others argue the exact opposite.

""One could equally say that 100 percent of Wisconsin pensions are funded by taxpayers, since taxpayers are the sole source of income for public sector workers, including the portion of their salaries that are deducted to meet pension contributions,"" The Economist magazine’s Buttonwood column argued in February 2011.

Asked if unions feel they gave up the same amount in foregone wage increases as they received in pension improvements, AFSCME’s McMurray said they have not documented the relationship.

Joshua Rauh, a Northwestern University finance professor who tracks pension costs, told us he doubted any serious economist would dispute the tradeoff, but the extent of the wage giveback is debatable.

""The answer is certainly not that 100 percent of the benefit was paid for by employees through lower wages,"" he said.

If the system is ""self-funded"" as Biel claimed, what happens when investment returns lag?

Critics say the taxpayer is on the hook when contributions are required beyond beyond those funded in the planned compensation package.

In reality that hasn’t happened -- but only because the laws were written so that the employer contribution was open-ended. It’s important to note that in bad times, many retirees get a smaller pension, too -- unlike pensioners in other states.

Our rating

Beil said the Wisconsin Retirement System for public employees is ""a self-funded pension plan"" and ""it’s the money of the workers’ that funds it.""

There’s an element of truth in his statement, in that workers for years made trade-offs in collective bargaining that to some unknown extent paid for the pension contribution their employers agreed to pick up. Even the state’s accounting system continued to show an annual worker contribution.

But Beil’s ""self-funded"" remark leaves the strong misimpression that taxpayers have little or no skin in the game, when, in fact, taxpayers have been the major source of the money in the pension fund.

Chris Christie claims New Jersey’s job gains in the last year “was the sixth highest in the nation”
","
Calling on state legislators Monday to approve a tax cut immediately, Gov. Chris Christie returned to a familiar rallying cry: job growth in New Jersey is among the highest in the nation.

""We’ve added nearly 85,000 private-sector jobs since February of 2010, seeing the best year of private-sector job growth in 2011 in over a decade and with 2012 already on pace to be even stronger,"" Christie said in a speech during the special session of the state Legislature.

""Our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation and we’re seeing housing sales, car sales and personal income increasing at higher rates than the nation.""

But in claiming ""our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation,"" the Republican governor also was making a familiar mistake, PolitiFact New Jersey found.

As we’ve noted in previous fact-checks, job growth can be measured in two ways -- the net increase in jobs and the percentage increase. Looking at percentage increases accounts for states’ different population sizes.

Christie’s claim is right in terms of the net increase, but wrong in regard to the percentage increase, according to seasonally adjusted data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Between May 2011 and May 2012, New Jersey gained 59,800 total nonfarm jobs -- including private- and public-sector employment -- for an increase of nearly 1.6 percent, according to the bureau. The May 2012 figures are preliminary.

That net increase places the Garden State in sixth place among the 50 states, just as Christie said.

But the percentage increase leaves the state in 13th place.

The governor made the same mistake in February, when he said private-sector job growth in 2011 ""places New Jersey in the top third among all of the states."" He received a Half True, because his claim was right for the net increase, but wrong for the percentage increase. 
The governor's office did not respond to requests for comment.

Our ruling

In a speech Monday during the special session of the state Legislature, Christie claimed ""our 12 month job increase was the sixth highest in the nation.""

That’s a very specific claim, but it’s only true when you look at New Jersey’s net increase of 59,800 total nonfarm jobs between May 2011 and May 2012. The percentage increase of nearly 1.6 percent leaves the state in 13th place.

pointed out that if we took an area of the Southwestern desert 100 miles on a side, that would be enough, in and of itself, to provide 100 percent of all the electricity needs for the United States of America in a full year.""
 
In January 2008,

Scientific American

published an influential article titled

""A Solar Grand Plan.""

 
A conservative writer immediately attacked Gore's claim. The

Scientific American

article ""did not say we needed an area 100 miles on each side, which is 10,000 square miles,"" William Tucker of the

American Spectator


wrote

a day after Gore's testimony. ""The article stated, 'To meet the 2050 projection [of electrical demand], 46,000 square miles of land would be needed...""
 
Gore's spokeswoman, Kallee Kreider, said Gore had cited the wrong source — he intended to cite

this report

from Environment America, an advocacy group that promotes clean energy.
 
That report in turn cites the U.S. Energy Department, which does indeed say on

this Web page

, ""The solar energy resource in a 100-mile-square area of Nevada [otherwise known as 100-miles-squared, or 10,000 square miles] could supply the United States with all its electricity using modestly efficient (10%) commercial photovoltaic modules.""
 
That's a compelling source, but the apparent contradiction cited by Tucker made us wonder. So we called two of the authors of the

Scientific American

piece, James Mason and Ken Zweibel. They said that Gore was probably correct, and in fact their article — far from contradicting his claim — contains data that support it.
 
Mason and Zweibel said that when they wrote that 46,000 square miles would be needed to meet the electricity demand in 2050, they were assuming electricity would provide a much greater portion of the country's energy than it does now — including, for example, 344 million plug-in hybrid vehicles.
 
A 10,000-square-mile solar plant could well provide

today's

electricity needs, they said.
 
Here's how (dense math ahead; proceed with caution):
 
As graphics accompanying the print version of the 

Scientific American

piece indicate, the sun in parts of the Southwestern United States provides an average of about 6.5 kilowatt hours per square meter per day of solar radiation.
 
Take that 6.5 kilowatt hours per square meter per day and multiply that by the 365 days in a year and you get 2,372 kilowatt hours per square meter per year. We'll round it to 2,400.
 
Solar-electric systems could — optimistically — convert about 15 percent of that to electricity. That comes to 360 kilowatt hours per square meter per year.
 
You can't cram solar panels close together, because they would cast shadows on each other. For every square meter of solar panel in the southwestern U.S., you need 2.5 square meters of space. Once you account for that (by dividing 360 by 2.5), you find each square meter of a solar installation could produce 144 kilowatt hours per year.
 
There are 25.9 billion square meters in 10,000 square miles. Multiply that 25.9 billion by the 144 kilowatt hours that a square meter can produce in a year, and you get 3,729 billion kilowatt hours per year.
 
The U.S. consumes about 3,900 billion kilowatt hours of electricity per year, according to the

federal Energy Information Administration

.
 
So Gore's estimate was close enough considering the many uncertainties involved.
 
""I don't think you've found a serious blunder,"" said Zweibel, director of the Institute for Analysis of Solar Energy at George Washington University.
 
""Anywhere from 100 to 150 miles per side will easily produce all the electricity in the United States with any solar technology,"" said Mason, director of the American Solar Action Plan and the Renewable Energy Research Institute in Farmingdale, N.Y.
 
That said, there are all sorts of reasons why building a 10,000-square-mile solar installation would be even more difficult than it sounds.
 
For one, we would need a place to store the electricity so that it could be doled out in the dark night hours and on cloudy days. Mason and Zweibel suggest using the solar energy to compress air underground in caverns, old mines, aquifers and depleted natural gas wells. Then it could be released on demand to turn turbines that would generate electricity.
 
Also, we would need a vast new system of transmission lines. To pay for that and other necessary improvements, Mason and Zweibel call for $420 billion of government subsidies.
 
Even given all the challenges, they, like Gore, argue large-scale solar development makes sense when you consider the enormous amounts of land, energy and money we currently use to mine fossil fuels, produce electricity from them and control their pollution.
 
Gore didn't exactly tell the whole story, since the 10,000-square-mile solar farm would not do the job ""in and of itself"" without other infrastructure improvements. But he was testifying on the broad issue of climate change, not delivering a lecture on building a solar plant. And his misattributing the claim to

Scientific American

is not a significant inaccuracy, since that article did contain statistics that support the claim.
 
We find Gore's claim True.

No money in the stimulus for San Francisco mice
","To hear Republican House members tell it, you'd think House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stuffed $30 million into the stimulus bill to benefit an endangered mouse in her district. Rep. Steve King of Iowa called it an earmark and ""a pet project"" while  pointing to a sign  he made that said ""Pelosi's Mouse slated for $30 Million."" Rep. John Boehner of Ohio opposed the bill and asked how money ""for some salt marsh mouse in San Francisco is going to help a struggling autoworker in Ohio?"" And Rep. Mike Pence of Indiana said on Fox News that there was ""$30 million in there to protect mice in San Francisco."" The tale of the mouse appears to have originated around Feb. 6, 2009, from Republican staff members of the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee. ""Appropriations Republicans, concerned with this irresponsible process and possible abuse of taxpayer funds, have asked various federal agencies how they intend to spend the windfall of cash that Congress may approve in the 'stimulus' bill,"" said a memo posted to the site. ""One peek behind the bureaucratic curtain has yielded the following examples of hidden program information that is  not included in the language of the bill or report  . These are programs which various federal agencies have privately indicated they will fund with 'stimulus' money."" The memo lists a number of projects, including up to $37.5 million for ""wetland restoration in the San Francisco Bay Area — including work to protect the Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse."" That became fodder for a Feb. 11 e-mail from Michael Steel, Boehner's spokesman. ""Thirty million dollars for wetland restoration in the San Francisco Bay Area — including work to protect the Salt Marsh Harvest Mouse,"" Steel wrote. ""This sounds like spending projects that have been supported by a certain powerful Democrat in the past. And it certainly doesn't sound like it will create or save American jobs."" That e-mail made it into a Feb. 12 story in the  Washington Times  headlined ""Pelosi's mouse slated for $30M slice of cheese."" The story stated, incorrectly as it turns out, that the stimulus bill ""includes $30 million for wetlands restoration that the Obama administration intends to spend in the San Francisco Bay Area to protect, among other things, the endangered salt marsh harvest mouse."" And that story was then picked up by the Drudge Report. That's when the mouse references exploded, morphing from a possible project of an unnamed agency to Pence's ""$30 million in there to protect mice in San Francisco."" We wanted to get to the bottom of this issue and find out what was up with the mouse. Turns out the salt marsh harvest mouse is a previously obscure beneficiary of a major environmental restoration project for the San Francisco Bay area. ""A friend e-mailed me and asked me if any of the $30 million for the mouse was for us, and I was like 'What are you talking about?'"" said Steve Ritchie, an engineer with the California State Coastal Conservancy, a state agency charged with preserving and restoring the coastline. When the stimulus bill was first proposed and a call went out for ready-to-go projects, Ritchie prepared a list of the agency's shovel-ready projects and submitted it to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, both of which received money in the final version of the stimulus bill. Three projects would turn abandoned industrial salt operations back into natural wetlands, about 26,000 acres in all. It turns out the mouse is an endangered species that likes tidal salt marshes, and it's  mentioned by name  as one of several species that will benefit. But the projects themselves — the  South Bay Bay Salt Pond Restoration Project  , the  Napa Plant Site  , and the  Napa Salt Marsh restoration  — are intended to do more than just benefit wildlife. It's major construction work to create recreation areas and to restore marshland that will resist flooding and storm surge. ""This is bulldozers, front-end loaders, backhoes. These are major earth-moving projects to break down levees, to resculpt the landscape and to make sure nature can do its thing,"" Ritchie said. ""Right now, we just have these lousy little salt pond levees and they break."" ""These are real jobs, and these are truly ready to go,""  he added. ""We can definitely spend this money for construction by Nov. 30, 2010."" Given this description of the projects, which were first reported in the  San Jose Mercury News  , it's a serious distortion to say there's money in the bill to protect San Francisco mice. The bill doesn't even list the San Francisco projects by name. And the funding agencies — the Corps of Engineers or NOAA — could still decide to fund the projects or not. The bill passed a final vote in the House on Feb. 13, with no Republicans supporting it. So Pelosi did not put an earmark in the bill to save the mice. In fact, there's no money in the bill for mice.

DeMint says stimulus plan would bar students from having prayer meetings in dorms
","The Democratic-led economic stimulus plan has been attacked by opponents as bloated, pork-ridden and ineffective. Now add antireligious to the list. Their complaint centers on a portion of the bill that would provide federal funds for colleges and universities to modernize, renovate or repair facilities. The bill specifically prohibits the funds to be used for buildings that may be ""used for sectarian instruction or religious worship; or in which a substantial portion of the functions of the facilities are subsumed in a religious mission."" It's the part that prohibits funds used to renovate a building used for ""religious worship"" that has many conservative groups concerned. The conservative criticisms were fueled by a 10-page legal argument released on Feb. 3, 2009, from the nonprofit American Center for Law & Justice, founded by evangelist Pat Robertson, which concluded that the language in the stimulus discriminates against private religious speech and argued that it ought to be removed. Sen. Jim DeMint of South Carolina took the reins and proposed an amendment to strike the language from the stimulus plan, but it failed by a vote of 54-43. In making his pitch for the amendment on the Senate floor on Feb. 5, DeMint called the language hostile to religion and warned it would open up colleges and universities to lawsuits from the likes of the American Civil Liberties Union and others. The language, DeMint said, ""would make sure that students could never talk openly and honestly about their faith. The fact is, any university or college that takes any of the money in this bill to renovate an auditorium, a dorm, or student center could not hold a National Prayer Breakfast there any longer because of what is written in this bill.""   ""Keep in mind that a prayer has been called by our courts to be religious worship,"" DeMint said. ""What this means is students cannot meet together in their dorms, if that dorm has been repaired with this federal money, and have a prayer group or a Bible study. They cannot get together in their student centers. They cannot have a commencement service where a speaker talks about their personal faith. ""The National Prayer Breakfast could not be held in a building renovated with funds from this bill,"" DeMint said. ""The Campus Crusade, a fellowship of Christian athletes, Intervarsity Christian Fellowship, Catholic and Jewish student groups who are meeting on campuses all over the country today could no longer meet in buildings that use funds from the bill we are talking about today. Classes on world religions or religious history, academic studies of religious texts could be banned by facilities that are renovated by this bill."" Howard Simon of the ACLU said it's preposterous to claim that the ACLU would sue if students in a dorm want to share their faith or organize a Bible study, even if that dorm was renovated with federal funds. ""On what basis would there be a lawsuit? There is a First Amendment in our country. People have a constitutional right to state their faith."" Barry Lynn, executive director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State, said the language in the stimulus plan amounts to little more than boilerplate for federal legislation, similar to language used for decades in the Higher Education Facilities Act. Lynn points to several Supreme Court decisions in the 1970s that upheld the constitutionality of such language, as well as that federal construction grants could be awarded to church-related colleges and universities. The Supreme Court has also consistently ruled that religious groups have as much right to equal access to public facilities as anyone else. For example, in 2001, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the Good News Club, a private Christian organization for children, which had been barred from using a public school for weekly afterschool meetings. Nonetheless, Robert Alt, deputy director of the Center for Legal and Judicial Studies at the Heritage Foundation, argues that the language in the stimulus bill was written overly broadly. Yes, he said, the Supreme Court has made clear what the law is on all this, so why add the language at all? The provision, as written, ""would seem to permit a legal challenge"" to all sorts of religious activity on college campuses in buildings renovated with fedeal funds, he said. Given the Supreme Court's decisions, though, wouldn't those challenges fail? ""The Supreme Court precedent is perfectly clear,"" Alt said. ""I think they would lose."" So what's the problem? Notwithstanding assurances from the ACLU and Americans United for Separation of Church and State that they would not sue over a group of students getting together for Bible study in a dorm room, the language opens the door for someone to bring ""needless litigation,"" Alt said. ""Why not make it better?"" Alt said. In reaching our conclusion, we note two things that advocates on both sides of the issue more or less agree to. First, the Supreme Court has repeatedly upheld that similar language in the Higher Education Facilities Act is constitutional. Second, the courts have been clear that religious groups are entitled to the same equal access to public facilities as any other group. Maybe someone will bring a lawsuit, as DeMint claims, if students hold a Bible study in a dorm that has been renovated with federal money from the stimulus plan. But both the ACLU and the Heritage Foundation say the Supreme Court's rulings indicate such a lawsuit would fail. Maybe the language could be clearer. But we think it's misleading for DeMint to claim that, if enacted, the stimulus plan would surely mean that students can't hold a prayer session in a dorm. We find his statement False.","[('U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Education and the Workforce,  ""Higher Education Act As Amended Through October 2002"" ', 'http://republicans.edlabor.house.gov/archive/publications/compindex.htm'), ('Huck PAC blog,  ""URGENT: Stimulus Bill Is Anti-Religious,""  by Mike Huckabee, Feb. 10, 2009', 'No link'), ('U.S. Senate Web site,  Senate Amendment 189 to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009):\xa0 To allow the free exercise of religion at institutions of higher education that receive funding ', 'http://www.huckpac.com/index.cfm?FuseAction=Blogs.View&Blog_id=2133'), ('U.S. House of Representatives, Committee on Rules,  Text of Conference Report on the merican recovery and Reinvestment Act ', 'No link'), ('U.S. Supreme Court Center,  Tilton v.

Bloggers post bogus claim about Obama and military oath
","
Two weeks ago, Matthew Avitabile, a 22-year-old grad student in upstate New York, decided to write a tongue-in-cheek blog item that said President Obama wanted soldiers to stop taking an oath to the Constitution and instead pledge their loyalty to the president himself.
 
Under the fake name Michele Chang — a name he dreamed up because he had just been talking to someone named Michele — Avitabile wrote

a bogus news story

that quoted a statement from White House spokesman Robert Gibbs saying, ""The president feels that the military has been too indoctrinated by the old harbingers of hate: nationalism, racism, and classism. By removing an oath to the American society, the soldiers are less likely to commit atrocities like those at Abu Ghraib.""
 
Avitabile labeled it satire in a note beneath the story, but in the superheated world of political blogs, where passions often run faster than reason, that wasn't enough.
 
The label got left off and his bogus story was quickly copied and pasted on blogs, zapped around the country through chain e-mails, and discussed in YouTube commentaries. Many people didn't bother to verify it and responded with comments of outrage.
 
""

Who does this megalomaniac think he is?"" someone commented on the Web site Digg.

 

""Good g*d---Obama is an egomaniac like we've never seen before. Another Hitler on the rise. This guy is just trashing everything the Consitution stands for,"" wrote someone named Kitty on the blog Tree of Liberty.

 
Someone identified as bill122460 posted a commentary about it on YouTube titled ""

OBAMA S HITLER OATH THIS IS MESSED UP

.""
 
""He don't belong in office,"" bill122460 said in the five-minute commentary. ""End of story.""
 
He added that it was ""a Hitler oath. I told you! Welcome to the United States of Nazi Germany!""
 

It's clear that bill122460 and many other people didn't know it was satire. Some of the blog postings referred to Michele Chang as if she were a well-known (and real) writer. ""Michele Chang: bama wants to have soldiers and officers pledge a loyalty oath directly to bama, not the Constitution,"" said one.


 
Some blogs were eventually corrected, or people posted comments that said the article was a fake, but others still carry the fake article. Brent Johnson, a radio host who posted the item on his Voice of Freedom blog, said he posted it without verifying it because ""This is one of those stories where, if it is true, is so, so serious. It’s the kind of thing people need to know about in the chance it is true.""
 
But now that Johnson has heard it is a satire, he said he will revise or remove the item.
 
Avitabile, a Republican who had previously poked fun at Obama with a tongue-in-cheek article that said scientists had determined that he was ""genetically superior,"" is thankful for all the traffic it generated for his blog Jumping in Pools. In the past he was lucky to get 1,000 hits on a story, but this one got more than 50,000. Yet he's disappointed that so many people published his work without verifying it.
 
""Out of the 50,000 who looked at it, only three had the good sense to contact me and see if it was true,"" he told us (PolitiFact was one of the three).


Avitabile described himself as a moderate Republican — ""I'm pro-gay rights, pro-wind energy"" — but said he was surprised that so many in his party had such negative feelings about Obama.
 
""People wanted to believe this about the president so bad, that he would really go toward a dictatorship so much that they would go with it without checking it,"" he said.
 
Indeed, we all know that passions run high in politics, but it's remarkable to us that so many people would pass along something that is so obviously ridiculous without verifying it. But we should have expected this. During the campaign, we found people were passing along e-mails claiming that

Obama wanted to adopt the Coke theme song as the National Anthem

.
 
So now, as we did for that one, we've got to set the meter ablaze. And this claim is not just Pants on Fire wrong. It's a reminder that if you get something shocking in your inbox, you should check it out before you pass it along.

Bogus e-mail is wrong about Pelosi and 'windfall profits' from stocks
","
Chain e-mails, generally characterized by exclamation points, typos and a strained relationship with the truth, were perhaps the most effective distribution method for falsehoods in the 2008 presidential campaign.
 
They spread like viruses, infecting the ill-informed and anyone unfortunate enough to be in their address book.
 
But they live on.
 
This one targets Nancy Pelosi, the California Democrat and speaker of the House of Representatives, accusing her of trying to take money from retirees and give it to illegal immigrants.
 
A version of this e-mail popped up as early as October 2006, just before the Democrats won control of the House. ""'Only the rich benefit from these record highs,'"" it alleged Pelosi said about the stock market. ""'There is no question these windfall profits and income created by the Bush administration need to be taxed at 100 percent rate and those dollars redistributed to the poor and working class.'""
 
Pelosi never said anything of the kind. (If she had, it's reasonable to conclude it would have hampered her fundraising, which netted $151,000 from the securities and investment sector in the past two years.)
 
A more recent version, forwarded numerous times to PolitiFact from readers imploring us to check it out, shares the same thrust, though it is in a class by itself when it comes to misplaced capital letters.
 
""Nancy Pelosi wants a Windfall Tax on Retirement Income,"" it says. ""Madam speaker [where's that shift key when you need it?] Nancy Pelosi wants to put a Windfall Tax on all stock market profits, including Retirement fund, 401K and Mutual Funds! Alas, it is true — all to help the 12 Million Illegal Immigrants and other unemployed Minorities!""
 
""Send it on to your friends,"" the e-mail concludes. ""I just did!! This lady is out of her mind.""
 
Pelosi's office is well-practiced at responding to inquiries about this hoax, and did so with a prepared letter from the speaker:
 
""Internet and e-mail rumors indicating that I support a windfall profits tax on earnings from the stock market are completely and utterly fabricated,"" Pelosi's letter says. ""In addition, my record on promoting retirement security and strengthening 401(k)'s and other savings incentives in the tax code contradict these rumors.""
 
The Democratic presidential candidates kicked around the idea of a windfall tax on oil companies, and Democrats support the idea of raising the capital gains tax rate somewhat. But there simply is not a shred of proof in the public record that Pelosi has ever advocated anything even remotely like the windfall tax described in these e-mails.
 
In her letter she provided links to two other fact-checkers who have debunked these e-mails, Snopes.com and Truthorfiction.com. She might consider adding FactCheck.org — they took on this hoax on Jan. 14, 2009.
 
And by all means, feel free to add us to the list. This chain e-mail, distinguished by its longevity and implausibility, is Pants on Fire wrong.

UPDATE: This claim was accurate when President Obama said it. As you can see below in the original item, it is indeed unprecedented to have three Cabinet members from the opposite party. The circumstances changed on Feb. 12, 2009, three days after Obama's statement, when Sen. Gregg

withdrew

. But because we rule on statements based on the wording and timing of statements, we're keeping this one as a True. Obama was correct when he said it on Feb. 9, for the way he said it.

 



 
So far, the votes on the massive economic stimulus package have fallen starkly along partisan lines. The bill that passed the House didn't get a single Republican vote, and the version that passed the Senate got a grand total of three.
 
During a news conference on Feb. 9, 2009, in which President Obama made his case for the stimulus plan, he was asked if pressing forward despite Republican objections meant the White House is moving away from its emphasis on bipartisanship.
 
""You know, when I made a series of overtures to the Republicans — going over to meet with both Republican caucuses; you know, putting three Republicans in my Cabinet, something that is unprecedented; making sure that they were invited here to the White House to talk about the economic recovery plan — all those were not designed simply to get some short-term votes,"" Obama said. ""They were designed to try to build up some trust over time.  And I think that as I continue to make these overtures, over time hopefully that will be reciprocated.""
 
We decided to check out whether Obama can accurately claim that his three Republican Cabinet appointments represent a bipartisan high-water mark in presidential history.
 
For starters, we're going to give Obama three Republicans, though a stickler could point out that Defense Secretary Robert Gates isn't actually registered as a Republican. But he's Republican enough in our book. Gates has served under several Republican administrations, and though he dropped his party registration to present an apolitical appearance while with the CIA, Gates himself said in December, ""I consider myself a Republican.""
 
The other two Obama appointees are card-carrying Republicans: Ray LaHood, a former congressman from Illinois, as secretary of transportation; and Sen. Judd Gregg of New Hampshire as commerce secretary (though he has not yet been confirmed).
 
And Obama is right. No other president has had this many.
 
For a little perspective, here's a rundown of the crossovers from a century's worth of presidential Cabinets:
 
• George W. Bush: Democrat Norman Mineta, transportation secretary.
 
• Bill Clinton: Republican William Cohen, defense secretary.
 
• George H. W. Bush: nada.
 
• Ronald Reagan: William Bennett was a Democrat when appointed as education secretary in 1985, but the following year, he became a Republican and has remained a conservative Republican voice ever since.
 
• Jimmy Carter: Republican James Schlesinger, who served as defense secretary under Republican presidents Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, was tapped by Carter as America's first energy secretary.
 
• Richard Nixon: Daniel Patrick Moynihan served as ambassador to the United Nations, which at the time was not a Cabinet-level position.
 
• John F. Kennedy: Republicans C. Douglas Dillon as treasury secretary and Robert McNamara as defense secretary. McNamara wasn't such a stretch though, as

Time m

agazine pointed out at the time, ""In politics, McNamara is a lukewarm, liberal Republican who often contributes to Democratic candidates. This year he voted for Kennedy.""
 
• Dwight D. Eisenhower: Democrat and Labor Secretary Martin Patrick Durkin, the ""plumber"" among Eisenhower's so called ""Nine Millionaires and a Plumber"" Cabinet. Durkin was replaced in 1953 by fellow Democrat James P. Mitchell, a so-called ""Democrat-for-Eisenhower.""
 
• Franklin D. Roosevelt: Republicans Frank Knox as secretary of the Navy and Henry Stimson, secretary of war.
 
""Nobody's got three,"" said presidential historian Richard Shenkman. ""This is unprecedented.""
 
Shenkman doesn't think you'll be hearing much from the secretaries of transportation or commerce any time soon — those Cabinet secretaries typically take a lower profile — but the appointment of Gates, he said, is ""highly significant.""
 
""I wouldn't call it tokenism,"" Shenkman said. ""I think it's real. He (Obama) is making some kind of an effort there. And it comes at very little cost. It's a shrewd political move.""
 
But Terry Sullivan, associate professor of political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, called the Obama appointments little more than political symbolism.
 
""The real question is not whether it's true or false (that Obama has appointed an unprecedented number of Republicans), but what it means,"" Sullivan said. ""I don't know what having a bipartisan Cabinet gets you. I don't see that it gets you anything.""
 
Yes, he said, it may mean a few Cabinet members can occasionally give a presidential policy some bipartisan cred. 
 
""I'm suggesting this is a very sophisticated political community,"" Sullivan said. It'd be one thing if Obama had appointed the Republican leader of the Senate to a high-level Cabinet position. That might move things toward some sort of reconciliation government, he said. ""But governing is way more sophisticated than these symbolic gestures.""
 
Whatever you make of the appointments, Obama is on solid ground when he said his three Republican Cabinet appointments were unprecedented. We rate his statement True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Michael Steele']","
Steele says government has never created a job. We conclude the opposite.
","Michael Steele, the former lieutenant governor of Maryland, recently won a contest to lead the Republican National Committee. He also made history as the first African-American to lead the party. One of Steele's first appearances was before a retreat for House Republicans on Jan. 31, 2009. Steele praised the House Republicans for voting as a block against the stimulus package promoted by Democrats and President Barack Obama. Then he said that the stimulus was pointless, because government can't create jobs. ""You and I know that in the history of mankind and womankind, government — federal, state, local, or otherwise — has never created one job. It's destroyed a lot of them. It's hampered a lot of them,"" Steele said. He went on to praise the diligence of the small business owners who ""build prosperity, to realize the American dream."" Listen to  an audio recording of his remarks  . This seemed a little strange to us: Many people work and retire from the federal government. The U.S. Postal Service rivals Wal-Mart as  the nation's largest employer  . Local governments tend to be the biggest employers in their communities when you count public school teachers and other school employees. A week after talking to the House Republicans, Steele appeared on  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  . Stephanopoulos showed Steele video of Republican Gov. Charlie Crist of Florida praising the stimulus bill. Steele didn't seem to back off the spirit of his previous comment. The exchange, which is a little long,  went down like this  : Crist (recorded earlier): ""This program will help us with education, with health care, Medicaid specifically, infrastructure. These are the kinds of things that produce jobs. It could mean $13 billion to the Sunshine State. It comes at a time when we need it. People need jobs. It's about jobs, jobs, jobs."" Stephanopolous (to Steele): ""He suggests that you and Republican Party leaders here in Washington are on the wrong side of the biggest issue, jobs."" Steele: ""Well, no — you know, with all due respect to the governor, I understand where he's coming from. Having been a state official, I know what it means to get those dollars when you're in tight times. But you've got to look at the entire package. You've got to look at what's going to create sustainable jobs. What this administration is talking about is making work. It is creating work."" Stephanopoulos: ""But that's a job."" Steele: ""No, it's not a job. A job is something that a business owner creates. It's going to be long term."" Stephanopoulos: ""So a job doesn't count if it's a government job?"" Steele: ""Hold on. No, let me finish. That is a contract. It ends at a certain point, George. You know that. These road projects that we're talking about have an end point. As a small-business owner, I'm looking to grow my business, expand my business. I want to reach further. I want to be international. I want to be national. It's a whole different perspective on how you create a job versus how you create work."" Stephanopoulos: ""I guess I don't really understand that distinction."" So we started looking for evidence that the government creates jobs. It wasn't hard to find. The Bureau of Labor Statistics says that the federal government is the nation's largest employer, with more than 1.8 million employees, excluding the post office. ""Competition is expected for many federal positions, especially during times of economic uncertainty, when workers seek the stability of federal employment,"" says a report posted on the Bureau of Labor Statistics Web site. ""In general, federal employment is considered to be relatively stable because it is not affected by cyclical fluctuations in the economy, as are employment levels in many private sector industries."" At USAJobs.com, you can look for a job with the federal government. On the day we looked, the Web site said, ""There are 37,409 U.S. government job opportunities worldwide,"" and invited applicants to seek by job title, keyword, city, state or zip code. We looked at lists of largest employers published by local chambers of commerce and found many local government entities listed. We randomly selected Durham, N.C., for example, and found that the chamber in 2007 listed the public schools as the third largest employer with 5,489 workers. The city of Durham was seventh largest employer with 2,336 jobs. The Veterans Administration Medical Center as ninth with 2,162 jobs, and ... well, we'll stop there. Perhaps in his mind Steele was trying to make a point that private sector jobs are superior to public sector jobs. But that's not what he said. He said that ""government — federal, state or local — has never created one job."" Then, in the interview with Stephanopoulos, he implied that only businesses can create jobs, not government. Steele may not like government jobs, but he can't wish them away. For trying to pretend that government jobs don't exist, we rate his statement Pants on Fire!","[('YouTube.com,  Michael Steele speaking to House Republicans  , Jan. 31, 2009, accessed Feb. 10, 2009', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UWmuX2ztlMc#t=6m05s'), ('ABC News,  This Week with George Stephanopoulos  , Feb. 8, 2009', 'No link'), ('Bureau of Labor Statistics,  Career Guide to Industries: Federal Government  , accessed Feb. 10, 2009', 'https://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/Story?id=6830708&page=3'), ('Greater Durham Chamber of Commerce,  Largest Employers in Durham County  , 2007', 'No link')]",/factchecks/2009/feb/10/michael-steele/steele-government-never-created-job-opposite/

Many choices for CBO numbers for 2009 and 2010
","One of the catch phrases for the stimulus has been ""timely, targeted, temporary."" Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., said the bill was none of those things, attacking it on the Senate floor on Feb. 5, 2009. We were particularly interested in his claim that it was not timely. The Congressional Budget Office, Roberts said, ""estimates that only 15 percent of this stimulus package will be spent in 2009; 37 percent, 2010; the remaining part spent in 2011 and beyond. Less than half the money will be spent by the end of next year.  This is not immediate relief that families and businesses desperately need now to help get the economy back on track."" We wondered about this because Democrats counter that the bill is timely, with as much as 80 percent of the money being spent in the first two years. Roberts' office pointed us toward a letter from the Congressional Budget Office dated Jan. 28, 2009. There it is in black and white: ""About 15 percent of that spending would occur in the remaining several months of fiscal year 2009; another 37 percent would be spent in 2010. A total of almost 80 percent of the cumulative 11-year spending would occur from 2009 through 2011."" Case closed, right? Not quite. The numbers the CBO referred to applied to spending from the House version of the bill introduced on Jan. 26, but left out what many people consider a key stimulative impact of the bill: its tax cuts. Also, the CBO considered spending according to fiscal years, which begin on Oct. 1. So when the CBO said that spending for 2009 is only 15 percent, it meant spending by Sept. 30, 2009, not the full calendar year. Additionally, Roberts made his remarks on Feb. 5. Yet, just three days earlier, the CBO had published a new analysis on the Senate version of the bill. The Senate version got its spending out of the gate faster: Using the same method of looking at only spending and not tax cuts, the CBO data showed that 20 percent would be spent in 2009, and 38 percent in 2010. That would push the money spent in those two years to 59 percent, which would be more than half spent by the end of the fiscal year 2010, which is Sept. 30, 2010. If you include the tax cuts in the Senate version, the bill's overall impact for 2009 and 2010 are 79 percent of the total package. So that is where the Democrats got their numbers in response. All are legitimate numbers from CBO reports, depending on how you pick and choose the data. Finally we should also note that none of this data addresses the late-night compromise reached by Democrats and three Republican senators on Feb. 6, 2009. As of this writing on Feb. 9, the CBO analysis of the compromise was still in the works. So we have several problems with Roberts' use of the CBO numbers. He uses numbers for a House bill in a Senate debate, when data on the Senate version has been available for several days. He refers to the stimulus ""package,"" but he uses figures that take into account spending only, ignoring the benefits of tax cuts. His statement leaves the impression that the Senate bill would do little by the end of 2010, and we find there's a lot in the CBO data to contradict that. For these reasons, we rate his statement Barely True.  ","[('Sen.

Obama says Republicans are quibbling over less than 1 percent of the stimulus plan
","In the battle for public opinion, Republican opponents of President Obama's economic stimulus plan have repeatedly scored points by ticking off various spending programs that seem hard to defend as economic stimulus. Hundreds of millions for contraceptives. Hundreds millions more for sexually transmitted disease prevention. Two hundred million to refurbish the National Mall, including new sod. Some Republican leaders warned the plan even cleverly funnels millions, maybe even billions, to the party's favorite villain, ACORN. In one of several interviews last week to promote the plan, Obama played defense, portraying those controversial projects as relatively small in the overall scope of a massive and urgently needed plan. ""People have plucked out this program or that program that doesn't look particularly stimulative, the contraceptives issue being a primary example,"" Obama said in an interview with the  CBS Evening News  on Feb. 3, 2009. ""If you add all that stuff up, it accounts for less than 1 percent of the overall package. Now, that doesn't mean that the package can't improve and that's what I said to the leadership last night, 'Let's improve it. Let's make this a package that is big enough for the moment.'"" Obama is right about some of the Republican sound bites that have drawn the most attention. A few examples: • ""How you can spend hundreds of millions of dollars on contraceptives — how does that stimulate the economy?"" — House Republican Leader John Boehner. • ""I mean, there's $300,000 for a sculpture garden in Miami. You know, there's $360 million for sexually transmitted disease education."" — Rep. Eric Cantor, the House Republican whip. • As much as ""$4.2 billion would be available to organizations like ACORN for so-called neighborhood revitalization. That's just political payoff."" — Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter.   • ""I mean, there are so many different things that you can make fun of in this bill. Let me just mention one — millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines. ... It doesn't stimulate anything."" — Sen. Jon Kyl, the Republican Whip. • ""In legislation before the Senate this week, $20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers or $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs is not going to put this economy back on track."" — Republican Rep. Mike Pence. PolitiFact has looked at a number of the Republican claims and found that some are accurate (such as spending for STD prevention), some are misleading (such as the claims about money for ACORN), some are outright wrong (such as the claim about money for a sculpture garden in Miami) and some have since been cut (such as money for contraceptives). We find that Obama is right that these projects are tiny in the scheme of a plan costing upwards of $800 billion. In fact, all those items listed above would come, as Obama said, to less than 1 percent of the package. Democrat Charles E. Schumer, the senior senator from New York, picked up that line of defense in an interview on Feb. 9 on MSNBC’s  Morning Joe  when he said, ""Why quibble over $200 million?"" But that argument from Schumer and Obama ignores more wholesale Republican criticisms of spending in the plan. For example, Sen. Tom Coburn and his staff put together a widely circulated list of more than 30 items in the proposed stimulus plan that he considers wasteful. That list includes a ""$2 billion earmark to restart FutureGen, a near-zero emissions coal power plant in Illinois that the Deptartment of Energy defunded last year because the project was inefficient"" and ""$246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers to buy motion picture film"" (since removed). The majority of his list comes to about 2 percent of the overall package, but jumps significantly when he includes $87.7 billion that he calls a state Medicaid bailout, a project that Democrats contend would have a good stimulative effect. John Hart, a spokesman for Coburn, said those items hardly comprise a list of the entirety of Coburn's objections to the stimulus package. ""These are items that are particularly egregious,"" Hart said. ""But there are thousands of provisions in there. These are just a few that jump out at us as particularly wasteful, the ones that didn't pass the smell or laugh test."" In fact, in an opinion piece written by Coburn for the   Wall Street Journal   , Coburn laid out his case that the overwhelming majority of Obama's plan is not stimulative. ""Less than 10 percent of the bill could be considered true stimulus, if one assumes tax credits and infrastructure spending will jolt the economy,"" Coburn stated. ""The other 90 percent of the bill represents one of the most egregious acts of generational theft in our nation's history, with taxpayer money going to special-interest earmarks, an ill-conceived bailout to states, and permanent spending increases that expand government's reach in areas like health care and education."" Coburn is hardly alone among Republicans in believing that major portions of the Obama stimulus plan aren't stimulative. Said Republican Rep. Kenny Marchant of Texas: ""This bill, quite frankly, was an attempt to sneak hundreds of billions of dollars in pork into an 'emergency' bill under the guise of 'stimulus.'"" Sen. Charles Grassley and other Republicans say they have less problem with the proposed tax cuts and shovel-ready projects where the money can be spent in two years. Grassley suggests, ""Cut all the spending out, keep the stimulus, do almost as much stimulus as you want to do and can do in two years, and keep the tax provisions. And what that adds up to, it would add up to a lot less than $900 billion. But whatever it adds up to doesn't bother me as much as what's in the $900 billion bill that's going to obligate us for the next 50 years as opposed to the next two years."" We're not going to weigh in one way or the other about whether the Republicans or Democrats are right about whether spending in the plan is stimulative — only that many Republicans have claimed large portions of it are not. Obama's point is that some perspective is in order, that legislators are quibbling over a relatively small portion of the spending. And yes, if he's talking about some of the most publicized projects, he's right. But we think that it's misleading to dismiss all of the complaints as less than 1 percent. In fact, many Republicans have said large percentages of the stimulus plan would not stimulate the economy and would waste taxpayer money. And so we rate Obama's statement Half True.          ","[('Wall Street Journal,  ""The Stimulus Package Is More Debt We Don\'t Need,""  by Sen.

Obama Porn Lawyer Laid Bare
","
To hear some conservative opponents talk about David Ogden, President Obama's choice for deputy attorney general, you might have expected recommendation letters to come to the Senate in plain brown wrappers.
 
""An Obscene Choice: Obama Taps Porn Lawyer for # 2 at Justice,"" blares a headline atop the Web site for Fidelis, a conservative group that has waged a PR campaign against Ogden's nomination.
 
According to a press release from Fidelis, ""President Obama's Choice for Deputy Attorney General has represented Playboy, Penthouse, the ACLU and others.""
 
First some background. Yes, as a lawyer in private practice more than 15 years ago, Ogden once did legal work on behalf of Playboy, Penthouse and other adult businesses. Ogden was then a lawyer in the Washington, D.C., office of the law firm Jenner & Block, which had an active constitutional practice representing a number of media clients with First Amendment issues.
 
In 1986, Ogden famously represented Playboy (as well as the American Council for the Blind, the American Library Association and others) when he successfully argued in federal court that the Library of Congress violated the First Amendment when it refused to fund publication of a Braille edition of

Playboy

magazine. The federal government pays to have many periodicals printed into Braille. Ogden was quoted in the

Washington Post

at the time hailing the decision as ""turning the tide in the censorship battle"" and saying that he hoped the printing of Braille editions of

Playboy

""is not an intolerable burden on the program"" but was ""the price of violating people's First Amendment rights.""
 
Ogden also sought an injunction to prevent the Meese Commission (a commission on pornopgraphy) from including

Playboy

in a potential ""black list"" of adult magazines. And he represented a mail-order distributor of adult videos that challenged the constitutionality of a multidistrict prosecution strategy. The Fidelis Web site documents numerous other briefs Ogden filed in obscenity cases on behalf of Playboy, the ACLU, the Amerrican Booksellers Association and others.
 
In a news release, Brian Burch, president of Fidelis, said, ""Ogden’s record is nothing short of obscene. He has represented Playboy Enterprises in multiple cases, Penthouse Magazine, the ACLU, and the largest distributor of hard-core pornography videos.  He has opposed filters on library computers protecting children from Internet smut, and successfully defended the right of pornographers to produce material with underage children.


""David Ogden has collected checks from Playboy and Penthouse to fight reasonable protections for parents and children from pornography. Ogden even sued the federal government in an attempt to publish Braille versions of Playboy magazine – at taxpayer expense, of course.""
 
During a hearing on Ogden's nomination on Feb. 5, 2009, several Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee grilled Ogden for nearly two hours about positions he took in some of those cases.
 
Several asked Ogden about the Library of Congress case.
 
""I was representing a client as a lawyer in private practice,"" Ogden explained. ""A lawyer in private practice does not sit in judgment of his clients. His job is to present their views as persuasively and appropriately as possible.""
 
Orrin Hatch, the ranking Republican on the Judiciary Committee, challenged Ogden about arguments he once made against a law requiring producers of sexually explicit material to keep records about the identity and age of performers. ""How,"" Hatch asked, ""can we believe the Department of Justice will properly enforce this law, and if necessary defend its constitutionality when you have said for 20 years that it is unconstitutional?""
 
Ogden said the courts have made it clear that the government has the power to require that records are kept, and he said, ""I think the law is constitutional as it stands today."" And he stressed that while he fought for constitutional issues in that case, it should not be interpreted that he believes obscene materials or child pornography should go unpunished or unregulated.
 
""I want to make it very clear that the laws against child pornography are extremely important laws,"" Ogden said.  ""I think that child pornography is abhorrent. I think the efforts to exploit children is abhorrent and deserves the full sanctions of the law. And that is my strong view.""
 
Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions noted that Ogden once argued against a congressional attempt to force librarians to put a filter on computers so that children could not view pornography. Sessions said he understood that lawyers advocate for their client's position, but he wanted to know what Ogden felt about that personally.
 
""I think it's quite important that children be protected from exposure to materials that is obscene to them,"" Ogden responded. ""I think that's a different standard than what's obscene to adults. I think it's appropriate for parents to want to have protections with respect to those materials.""
 
Republican Sen. Jon Kyl called Ogden's attention to arguments he made against the conviction of a man found in possession of videos with girls in bikinis, or otherwise scantily clad, striking provocative poses and gyrating suggestively. A court later ruled the videos were clearly intended to pander to pedophiles. Ogden filed a brief on behalf of booksellers and library associations arguing that the videos did not constitute child pornography, that the standard ought to be nudity. They lost.
 
Ogden said he'd have no problem enforcing the law, and that he would stand up for it if confirmed.
 
""That was an argument made for a client,"" Ogden said. ""As the lawyer for the United States, I will aggressively and appropriately enforce the law of the U.S. to its full letter.""
 
So that's a few highlights of Ogden's representation of the adult business.
 
Supporters — many of them Republicans — say those cases are hardly career-defining for Ogden. Rather, they note that while head of the Department of Justice's civil division, Ogden was part of the team that defended the Child Pornography Prevention Act of 1996; and that he helped to defend the Child Online Protection Act of 1998.
 
In the hearing on Feb. 5, Ogden said one of his proudest professional moments came from a brief he filed for the American Psychological Association arguing that child victims of sexual abuse sex ought to be allowed to testify via closed-circuit television due to the psychologically damaging effects of having to testify in person.
 
For the last eight years, Ogden has worked for the law firm WilmerHale, where he is a partner and co-chair of the Government and Regulatory Litigation Practice Group. His clients include pharmaceutical, petrochemical, insurance, automotive, airline and media companies. For a more complete look at some of the work Ogden has done for WilmerHale, check out

his page

on the company Web site.
 
Reginald Brown, a former Bush Administration official and current law partner of Ogden, said Ogden's work for adult businesses has been vastly overplayed.

 

""He took some positions on behalf of interest groups that obviously the government disagreed with,"" Brown said. ""It was by no means a majority of his practice. The bulk of his practice over the last eight years has been representing various companies — energy companies, pharmaceuticals and even some government agencies. I would describe it as a wide-ranging commercial litigation practice.""


As for the work for Playboy, Penthouse and other distributors of adult videos, Brown said. ""The extent of that work is greatly exaggerated and is taken out of context. It's borderline libelous to suggest that David has a huge practice representing the pornography industry. That's not to say he didn't work on the cases cited.""
 
Said Ben LaBolt, a spokesman for the Obama administration: ""David Ogden is committed to fighting for families and children. That is why his nomination has been supported by the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, the Boys and Girls Club of America, among others. While Ogden served at DOJ, he led the U.S. government’s defense of various antipornography statutes against constitutional attack, arguing forcefully against positions taken in some of those cases by former clients.  He will do so again as Deputy Attorney General.""
 
We take LaBolt's point. And we think when some people hear Fidelis and others refer to Ogden as a ""porn lawyer"" they may assume that Ogden spent the better part of his career representing the pornography industry. That's just not the case. Ogden's work with adult-oriented companies came more than 15 years ago, and only reflects a fraction of his body of work as an attorney both in private practice and for the government. And we appreciate Ogden's point — made repeatedly in the hearing — that lawyers sometimes take a position on behalf of a client that doesn't necessarily reflect  the views of the attorney.
 
Still, it is undisputed that Ogden once did significant legal work on behalf of Playboy and other adult businesses, no matter how many years or clients ago it was. And so we rate the comment Mostly True.

FedEx chair delivers perspective on bonuses
","
Reports about big bonuses for Wall Street executives have struck a nerve with people who wonder how the executives can justify large payments when their firms are in shaky condition or are seeking federal help.
 
It's drawn the ire of President Obama, who called it ""the height of irresponsibility. It's shameful."" On Feb. 4, 2009, he said top executives at firms receiving federal aid will have their compensation capped at $500,000 and that bonuses would have to come as stock that they can't receive until the government is reimbursed.
 
The New York State Comptroller reported in late January that Wall Street firms in 2008 handed out $18.4 billion in cash bonuses to employees who live in New York City, the sixth-largest amount on record. Critics have said the employees don't deserve the rewards because the firms lost more than $35 billion in 2008 and the federal government is spending hundreds of billions of dollars bailing out many of them.
 
Fred Smith, chief executive of FedEx and supporter of George W. Bush, John McCain and other Republicans, tried to cool down the heated discussion with a bit of perspective on ABC's

This Week

on Feb. 1, 2009.
 
Host George Stephanopoulos noted that Smith ""actually took a pay cut in December. You announced a 20 percent pay cut because of the performance of FedEx over the last year, because of the tough economic times. And I wonder ... what do you think of the bonus structure now on Wall Street?""
 
Smith replied that compensation on Wall Street is built on bonuses ""much more so than in the industrial sector. As I understand it, the average bonus in that $18 billion is about $100,000 a year. The bonuses on Wall Street are down about 44 percent.""
 
Smith was not far off when it came to the average cash bonus. It was $112,000 in 2008, according to New York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli's Jan. 28, 2009, report.
 
And indeed bonuses were down 44 percent in a sense: The total amount given out in bonuses, $18.4 billion, was a decline of 44 percent from the $32.9 billion handed out in 2007.
 
But due to job losses on Wall Street, there were fewer employees to split the pie in 2008. So the average bonus was down a slightly more modest 37 percent from the previous year's average.
 
Also, it might have been worth pointing out that while bonuses were well below the 2007 level, that average of $112,000 was still the fifth-highest since the comptroller's office started keeping records in 1985. And the total haul of $18.4 billion was the sixth highest on record. Both were around the same as 2004, a vastly better year for the securities industry and its investors.
 
And although it's true that bonuses generally make up a substantial portion of the compensation on Wall Street, $112,000 is still more than twice the average salary in the United States.
 
But Smith is free to use statistics selectively — and the statistics he chose were off by just $12,000 and a few percentage points. We find his statement Mostly True.

Stimulus has money to help fish, off-roaders
","In a speech on the House floor on Feb. 3, 2009, Republican Rep. Mike Pence sounded off about what's in the stimulus bill before Congress. ""In legislation before the Senate this week, $20 million for the removal of small to medium-sized fish passage barriers or $25 million to rehabilitate off-roading trails for ATVs is not going to put this economy back on track,"" Pence said. ""And, it was exactly that kind of wasteful government spending that resulted in unanimous Republican opposition last week."" We wanted to check to see if the bill includes the money Pence mentioned. Some of our previous reports have shown that opponents of the bill have not been  completely   truthful  about what's in the bill. In this case, Pence is right. The Senate report on the bill, as of this writing, includes $20 million ""for the removal of small- to medium-sized fish passage barriers,"" which means  clearing barriers  in rivers and streams to allow fish migration. It's part of an overall $190 million for the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service for habitat restoration projects that ""accomplish ecological goals and provide employment opportunities in the local communities."" The report also says the projects can be modified to ""achieve the goals of maximum job creation and most effective use of resources."" Similarly, the $25 million for recreation maintenance, ""especially for rehabilitation of off-road vehicle routes,"" is part of an overall $135 million for the Bureau of Land Management, which includes funding for trail maintenance, remediation for environmental and public safety hazards on public lands, and habitat restoration. This passage also allows for modification for ""the goals of maximum job creation and most effective use of resources."" A Democratic spokesman defended the funding when we asked about Pence's criticism. ""Preserving our national parks and preserving our wildlife don't seem to be unreasonable goals,"" said Rob Blumenthal, a Democratic spokesman for the Senate Committee on Appropriations. ""These are ready-to-go jobs that will employ American workers."" The Fish and Wildlife Service said the work to remove fish barriers is ""shovel ready"" and includes projects like building bypasses around large dams and demolishing obsolete mill runs that date back to colonial times. ""There's going to be a lot of work for local contractors,"" said Fish and Wildlife spokesman Chris Tollefson. ""We're talking about restoring native fish runs all over the country."" We'll let others decide if the projects are worthy or not. We should point out that almost any job the government pays someone to do is technically stimulating the economy by creating income and reducing unemployment, if only by the smallest amount. Also, the two projects combined account for not even 1 percent of the bill — more like .005 percent. Nevertheless, $45 million for most people is serious money. When he made his remarks, Pence had his facts straight on what was in the legislation — $20 million for fish-barrier removal and $25 million for off-road trails. We rule his statement True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/07a56563-3240-4087-a1bf-60b7abb63097","[('Rep.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Stimulus', 'Robert Gibbs']","
Stimulus bill includes projects that some consider earmarks
","For weeks, President Obama and his aides have said it is critical that the economic stimulus package not contain any ""earmarks,"" projects that are often viewed as wasteful or frivolous. This week, Obama's spokesman Robert Gibbs declared they had succeeded. At his daily briefing on Feb. 2, 2009, Gibbs said the bill contains ""unprecedented accountability and transparency.  There are no earmarks in this bill.  The information on the projects that will be funded in this legislation will be available online, as you know, at  www.recovery.gov  .  There will be an oversight board that will monitor the progress of each project and address any problems that are involved early and aggressively."" Obama made a similar claim in an interview with ABC on Feb. 3, saying, ""If you take a look at the bill, the fact is, there are no earmarks in this bill, which, by the way, some of the critics can't claim for legislation they've voted for over the last eight years."" Given all the complaints Republicans have made about the bill, we wondered if Gibbs and Obama were right.  What's an earmark?  We need to start by explaining the different ways earmarks are defined. The term comes from the practice of marking the ears of livestock for identification. It has been used in American politics since the 1930s and has come to mean money that is ""set aside . . . for a special project or purpose,"" according to  Safire's Political Dictionary,  a well-regarded reference book on political terms. But  Safire  's notes that in Congress, the term often has a narrower meaning: ""funds that individual senators or representatives specify be directed to projects and activities that will benefit particular people, institutions or locations in their home constituencies."" The Office of Management and Budget, an agency that is essentially an extension of the White House, offers a definition with a little executive branch attitude: ""Earmarks are funds provided by the Congress for projects or programs where the congressional direction (in bill or report language) circumvents the merit-based or competitive allocation process, or specifies the location or recipient, or otherwise curtails the ability of the Executive Branch to properly manage funds."" If you sense a little snarkiness in the OMB definition, it's because the executive branch doesn't fancy the legislative branch telling it what to do. But members of Congress, particularly those on the Appropriations Committee, say an earmark is simply how the legislative branch fulfills its duty under the Constitution to tell the executive branch what to do. (Article 1, Section 9: ""No money shall be drawn from the treasury, but in consequence of appropriations made by law."") Because of the fuss over the ""Bridge to Nowhere"" and other controversial projects, the House and Senate now have rules requiring members to disclose their requests for earmarks. The Senate avoids the fuzzy term ""earmark,"" preferring the more lawyerly ""Congressionally directed spending items,"" which it defines as ""a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Senator providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula driven or competitive award process."" The Senate definition also covers tax benefits for ""a particular beneficiary or limited group of beneficiaries."" The House rule defines earmark as ""a provision or report language included primarily at the request of a Member, Delegate, Resident Commissioner, or Senator providing, authorizing or recommending a specific amount of discretionary budget authority, credit authority, or other spending authority for a contract, loan, loan guarantee, grant, loan authority, or other expenditure with or to an entity, or targeted to a specific State, locality or congressional district, other than through a statutory or administrative formula driven or competitive award process.""  More earmarking in Senate  The stimulus bills are huge. The Senate version has more than 700 pages that on average cost more than $1 billion per page. In general, the approach behind the bills is to leave the specific spending decisions to federal agencies and states and municipalities. For example, the bill's don't specify particular highways for federal money. The states can decide. Still, there are plenty of specifics in the House and Senate versions that indicate members of Congress are earmarking, at least in the broad sense of the word. PolitiFact has spent the past couple of weeks fact-checking many claims about what's in the bills. Although we found Eric Cantor was  Pants on Fire wrong  when he said the House bill included $300,000 for a Miami sculpture garden, the Republicans were right the House bill  had $335 million for prevention of sexually transmitted diseases  , and that the Senate version  authorizes $198 million for Filipino veterans.  (We should note that the Senate bill is a work in progress and that the contents may change; our rulings are accurate for the time when the statement was made.) When the House bill was being considered, it had controversial elements such as money for improvements to the National Mall, which some people consider an earmark. But that was stripped out before final passage. Matthew Specht, a spokesman for Rep. Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican who is considered the biggest critic of earmarks in the House, told us, ""Yeah, we agree that the House version can probably be considered earmark-free."" There seems to be more earmarking in the Senate version, however. Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla., has highlighted many provisions he considers to be earmarks, including a $246 million tax break for Hollywood movie producers. It would allow large Hollywood studios the opportunity to choose between an existing tax break or write off 50 percent of the entire production cost for movies and TV shows made in 2009. It was in the bill when Gibbs made his statement but was removed Feb. 3 when Coburn passed an amendment 52-45 to remove it. To answer whether that project and others could be considered earmarks, we turned to Taxpayers for Common Sense, a Washington advocacy group that tracks government spending and highlights waste. Steve Ellis, the group's vice president, said congressional leaders had generally resisted the urge to fill the bill with earmarks, according to the strict definitions of the word. But he said there still were some projects in the bills that he and other people would consider earmarks. ""There’s at least a few and I wouldn’t be surprised if we end up finding more,"" he said, citing the provision for Filipino veterans as an example. Coburn spokesman John Hart and Taxpayers for Common Sense also cited another project as an earmark: a provision in the bill calling for $2 billion for a ""near zero emissions powerplant."" They say the money is intended to restart FutureGen, a near-zero emissions coal power plant in Illinois that is supported by Sen. Dick Durbin. Senators are also employing a  wink-wink  approach that uses vague-sounding language in a committee report to quietly direct money to pet projects. Although the language does not sound specific, groups that track earmarks say it's clear where senators want the money to go. For example,  a report on the bill  from the Senate Appropriations Committee specifies $70 million for ""supercomputer activities, especially as they relate to climate research."" The  Senate Conservatives Fund,  a political action committee, says that is probably targeted for the National Center for Environmental Prediction in Camp Springs, Md.  The group also cites $250 million that is designated ""to repair NASA facilities damaged by Hurricane Ike and to reduce the significant backlog of maintenance and repair projects at NASA facilities nationwide."" That appears to be for the Johnson Space Center in Houston. Those projects don't have senators' names attributed to them, but the Senate Conservatives Fund points out that senators on the Appropriations Committee include Barbara Mikulski of Maryland and Kay Bailey Hutchison of Texas. It's worth noting that Obama's observation about the overall nature of the bill is mostly correct. The House and Senate stimulus bills have not been stuffed with hundreds of pet projects the way that highway, energy and water bills often are. And that's especially true for the House bill. But the Senate version includes at least several projects that we consider to be earmarks. The Filipino project might not fit the narrow definition of earmarks that Congress or OMB uses, but we think reasonable people would consider it to be an earmark. And the movie industry tax break, which was in the bill when Gibbs made his statement, and the Texas and Maryland projects sure look like earmarks by any definition. Gibbs didn't leave himself any wiggle room. He said ""no earmarks."" But we see at least a few, so we find his statement to be False.","[('Today show,  Interview of President Obama  , Feb. 1, 2009', 'https://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=439449&keyword=&phrase=&contain='), ('The Free Dictionary,  earmark,  accessed Feb. 3, 2009', 'No link'), ('St. Petersburg Times,  Bridge to Nowhere: Three words that changed U.S. politics,  April 1, 2007', 'https://www.thefreedictionary.com/earmark'), ('Office of Management and Budget,  Earmarks,  accessed Feb. 3, 2009', 'No link'), (' U.S. Constitution ', 'http://www.sptimes.com/2007/04/01/Worldandnation/Three_words_that_chan.shtml'), ('Congressional Research Service,  Earmark Disclosure Rules in the Senate:  Member and Committee Requirements  , April 29, 2008, accessed Feb. 4, 2009', 'No link'), ('Congressional Research Service,  Earmark Disclosure Rules in the House:  Member and Committee Requirements  , April 29, 2008, accessed Feb. 4, 2009', 'http://earmarks.omb.gov/'), ('Congressional Record,  Debate over film industry tax break  , Feb. 3, 2009', 'No link'), ('ABC News,  Interview with President Obama  , Feb. 3, 2009', 'http://www.law.cornell.edu/constitution/constitution.articlei.html#section9'), ('William Safire, Safire\'s Political Dictionary,  ""earmark,""  accessed Feb. 4, 2009', 'No link'), (""Sen.

Stimulus plan includes plan to compensate Filipino vets, but no actual money
","In an interview with  Fox News Sunday  , Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Ariz., argued that the Democratic-backed economic stimulus package is so full of waste and clutter that legislators ought to scrap it entirely and start fresh. ""I mean, there are so many different things that you can make fun of in this bill,"" Kyl said. ""Let me just mention one — millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines. Now, that may be a good thing to spend money on, but not in a stimulus bill. It doesn't stimulate anything."" Does the Senate version of the stimulus package really include millions for Filipino vets? The answer is yes. And no. Let's start at the beginning. During World War II, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos fought for the United States with the promise that after the war they'd get a path to U.S. citizenship and would also qualify for full veterans benefits. Thousands of Filipinos died in the infamous Bataan Death March. But soon after the war, Congress reneged and established that Filipino veterans would not be recognized as “active service” for the purpose of any U.S. law conferring ""rights, privileges or benefits."" Filipino veterans activists have been fighting it ever since. Fast forward to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, otherwise known as the economic stimulus bill. In the 735-page version of the bill now before the Senate, there are a full seven pages dedicated to ""Payments to eligible persons who served in the United States armed forces in the Far East during World War II."" It details a plan to compensate Filipinos who fought for the United States during World War II with lump-sum payments of $15,000 for those who are U.S. citizens and $9,000 for those still living in the Philippines. There are an estimated 18,000 Filipino vets still living who might qualify for payments; about 7,000 of them U.S. citizens. The total cost: up to $198 million. In a statement explaining its inclusion in the stimulus plan, Sen. Daniel Inouye, D-Hawaii, said the bill would right a wrong. ""This nation made a solemn promise, and with hardly a hearing, we revoked it,"" Inouye stated. ""This is not the America I know and love. This episode is a blight upon the character of the United States, and it must be cleansed."" Time is of the essence, Inouye said. ""It should be noted that as you read this, many of the Filipinos who would qualify are on their deathbeds. Today, the average age of these men is about 90."" Whether or not the bill has merit is beside the point, said Steve Ellis of Taxpayers for Common Sense. ""This has no business being in an economic stimulus bill,"" Eliis said. ""It's just catching a ride on this legislation. It's just cluttering up an already complicated and wordy piece of legislation."" Retired Col. Romy Monteyro, who has testified several times before Congress to lobby for compensation for Filipino World War II vets, said the bill has kicked around Congress for several years and ""Inouye wanted to create a shortcut and put it in the stimulus package.""   ""This is not a waste of money,"" Monteyro said. ""These people are suffering. They are in the twilight of their lives. They should be rewarded for all they did for the U.S. during the war."" But here's the thing: If passed as currently written, the money for the program wouldn't come out of the stimulus package. It was approved in another bill passed last year, said Rob Blumenthal, Democratic communications director for the Senate Committee on Appropriations. If the stimulus legislation passes, it would authorize that money to be released, he said, but ""the amount of money for it in the stimulus bill is zero. The money was appropriated last year; it's not coming out of the stimulus bill."" So why is it even in the stimulus plan? Well, it so happens that Inouye is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, the very same committee that wrote this part of the stimulus plan. No, Inouye stated, it would not appropriate any money, but ""it will close a dark chapter in the history of this country."" Compensation for Filipino vets was not in the version of the stimulus plan passed by the House. The original legislation has another high-profile backer: President Barack Obama. Back in the campaign, in a May 2, 2008 ""open letter to the people of Guam,"" Obama noted that he co-sponsored the Filipino Veterans Equity Act in the Senate ""because I believe deeply that we must honor the heroic sacrifices of Filipinos who fought side by side with Americans on behalf of freedom. … This bill finally provides Filipino veterans and their survivors with the benefits that they were promised, and that they bravely earned in battle."" However, we could not find any statements by Obama on whether he supports its inclusion in the stimulus package. So back to Kyl's statement that the stimulus plan includes ""millions of dollars to World War II Filipino veterans in the Philippines."" The Senate version of the bill does include provisions for a program to compensate Filipino vets; and most of those who would be eligible for payments live in the Philippines. And, yes, the program is ""authorized"" for up to $198 million. But that wouldn't actually be part of the stimulus spending. That brings us to a Half True.","[('Fox News,  ""Transcript: Sens.

Stimulus plan comes to more than a million bucks a day since Jesus Christ was born
"," In a CBS  Face the Nation  interview on Feb. 1, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell , R-Ky, sought to put the proposed economic stimulus bill into some sobering perspective. ""You know, this is huge money,"" McConnell said. ""This is — someone said the other day that, if you started the day Jesus Christ was born and spent $1 million every day since then, you still wouldn’t have spent $1 trillion.” The bill isn't that expensive yet — the House version is estimated at $819 billion — but the Senate is expected to add new programs and additional tax cuts that could increase the cost significantly. Both chambers are expected to keep the total pricetag under $1 trillion. We'll save you from counting zeros on your online calculator and give you our quick and dirty assessment of whether his analogy is right.   First, a starting point. Biblical scholars may quibble about the actual birth date of Jesus Christ, but we're going to go with the fairly  commonly accepted theory  that it was around 4 B.C. That's right, it would mean Christ was actually born ""Before Christ.""   Add that to Anno Domini time, and you come to 2012 years since the birth of Christ.   So here goes our math: 2,012 times 365 (yes, we are aware there are leap years ... don't be like that) times $1,000,000. A: $734 billion (give or take a few hundred million).   The stimulus package is actually short of $1 trillion too, $819 billion. But that's still more than a million bucks a day since the day Jesus was born.

In theory, ACORN could compete for some home rebuilding money in stimulus plan
 ","
In criticizing the economic stimulus bill, Republicans have found an old villain: ACORN.
 
A frequent object of Republican derision and scorn during the presidential election, the Association of Community Organization for Reform Now (ACORN) has become a popular target in GOP attacks on the $819 billion, Democratic-backed economic stimulus plan.
 
Some Republicans say the plan could steer billions of federal dollars to this left-leaning community organizing group.
 
You remember ACORN. In the 2008 election campaign, ACORN was lambasted in many Republican circles for voter registration efforts that resulted in some fraudulent names (Mickey Mouse, it turns out, was not an eligible voter). ACORN leaders said they discovered the fake names, notified authorities and fired some workers who cut corners. Some Republican leaders claimed it was a willful effort to forward the group's liberal agenda.
 
So how does ACORN factor into the economic stimulus bill? Some Republican leaders have noted that a House version of the stimulus package includes $4.2 billion for ""neighborhood stabilization."" The Senate version of the bill calls for $2.2 billion. The money would be doled out to groups to buy up abandoned and foreclosed homes, to rehabilitate them and then sell or rent them out. The government already has such a program, but the money is only available to government agencies. The stimulus package would allow nonprofits to compete for this kind of work as well. Some Republicans view that as a backdoor attempt to fund groups like ACORN.
 
""The legislation could open billions of taxpayer dollars to left-wing groups like the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now (ACORN), which has been accused of voter fraud, is reportedly under federal investigation, and played a key role in the housing meltdown,"" House Republican Leader John Boehner said in a Jan. 26 news release.
 
Louisiana Republican Sen. David Vitter went one step further, telling Newsmax TV that ""$4.2 billion dollars would be available to organizations like ACRON for so-called neighborhood revitalization. That's just political payoff, quite frankly, not in spite of their voter registration fraud activity, really because of it, in my opinion, in terms of support from some of the liberals in Congress.""
 
We read the fine print from the House version of the stimulus package and saw no money designated for ACORN, or any other specific nonprofit organization. Kirstin Brost, a spokeswoman for the Democratic chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, said the lion's share of the neighborhood stabilization funds would go to local governments. But the authors of the stimulus plan decided to open the process to nonprofits, she said, because they have found that some local governments could not, or were not interested, in participating in the program.
 
""Some local governments were very good and some local governments didn't have the capacity to do it and the money just sat there,"" Brost said.
 
Under the House plan, nonprofits would be allowed to compete to do some of the work. They would have to prove they are ""capable of moving the money out the door quickly and efficiently,"" Brost said. ""They would have to go through stringent competition. They would have to use the money to purchase homes, renovate them and then rent them out or resell them. They couldn't use it for anything else. ... We absolutely

have

to do something about foreclosed homes.""
 
If Democrats were trying to steer money to ACORN, say ACORN leaders, they sure picked an odd way to do it. ACORN has never done this type of foreclosure work, and according to ACORN's chief organizer, they don't plan to.
 
In response to Boehner's statement, ACORN chief organizer Bertha Lewis stated: ""We watch with bemusement as he tries to gin up opposition to progressive solutions to America's deep economic crisis by accusing ACORN of doing something we have never done. We have not received neighborhood stabilization funds, have no plans to apply for such funds, and didn't weigh in on the pending rule changes.""
 
Sister organization ACORN Housing Corp. has developed some housing in several cities, but it also has never done any foreclosure work.
 
""We theoretically could apply,"" said Richard Hayes, director of strategic projects for ACORN Housing. ""But we would have to compete like everyone else. There is no guarantee we would be chosen.""
 
Keep in mind, Hayes said, ACORN Housing and ACORN are separate corporate entities. They have separate boards and separate headquarters in different cities. So even if ACORN Housing were to apply for funds, it would not be comingled with ACORN funds for voter registration efforts.
 
""They are trying to imply there is money set aside for us,"" said Brian Kettenring, an ACORN spokesman. ""That is a fabrication for political ends.""
 
ACORN is obviously a negative buzzword in some conservative circles, and we think some Republicans are trying to capitalize on that to discredit the stimulus plan. Could ACORN Housing apply for some of the money? Sure. So could lots of other nonprofits. They'd have to compete, though. And they'd have to use the money to buy up abandoned or foreclosed homes, fix them up and resell or rent them.
 
Boehner's comments imply money is earmarked for ACORN (it's not) or that money would be funneled to suspect voter registration programs (it wouldn't). And so we rate his comment Barely True.

Some economists disagree with Obama
","There's plenty of debate about how to respond to the economic crisis, but you wouldn't know that from the comments of President Obama and fellow Democrats. ""Economists from across the political spectrum agree that if we don't act swiftly and boldly, we could see a much deeper economic downturn that could lead to double-digit unemployment and the American dream slipping further and further out of reach,"" Obama said in his weekly address on Jan. 3, 2009. ""Every economist from right to left, Republican, Democrat, advises that (a government stimulus) has to be a very substantial package,"" said Democratic Congressman Steny Hoyer of Maryland on Jan. 4. ""There's no disagreement that we need action by our government — a recovery plan that will help to jump-start the economy,"" Obama said at news conference on Jan. 9. ""Everybody, I think, from economists on the left to economists on the right realize that we must make critical investments at this time,"" said White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel on Jan. 18. The libertarians at the Cato Institute got weary of this line of argument and took out a newspaper ad in the  New York Times  on Jan. 28, 2009. ""With all due respect Mr. President, that is not true,"" the ad said. ""More government spending by Hoover and Roosevelt did not pull the United States economy out of the Great Depression in the 1930s. More government spending did not solve Japan's 'lost decade' in the 1990s. As such, it is a triumph of hope over experience to believe that more government spending will help the U.S. today,"" the ad says. ""Lower tax rates and a reduction in the burden of government are the best ways of using fiscal policy to boost growth."" The Cato ad has 203 signatories, including three recent Nobel Prize winners. We talked to one of the Nobel winners, Edward Prescott of Arizona State University, who won in 2004, about Obama's plan. ""I agree with his wants, but just because you want something, that doesn't make it happen,"" Prescott said. ""I guess he thinks that everything can be solved by people's goodwill and good actions coming from Washington, D.C."" Prescott advocates for a permanent reductions of the income tax or, failing that, nothing. ""I hope Obama succeeds, but benign neglect is a good policy,"" he said. Before we go much further, we should point out that there are many economists who  do  believe a stimulus is needed, and yesterday. For what it's worth, the most recent recipient of the Nobel for economics, Paul Krugman, supports the stimulus and has written about how wrong the opponents are. ""Conservatives really, really don’t want to see a second New Deal, and they certainly don’t want to see government activism vindicated. So they are reaching for any stick they can find with which to beat proposals for increased government spending,"" Krugman wrote recently in  his New York Times column  . Far be it from us to referee a knife fight between Ph.D. economists. But for those who are interested in how economists deal with facts, we would point you to the very interesting blog and podcasts of  economist Russell Roberts  of George Mason University. Roberts also opposes the stimulus bill, though he did not sign the Cato ad. Roberts said that economists actually agree on lots of things, but when it comes to big, new problems like the recent crisis, things get complicated. It's difficult to look back in history and pinpoint exact causes for economic turnarounds. ""We're trying to tease out the effect of one social policy in the face of hundreds of thousands of other changes,"" he said in a podcast on the role of  empirical evidence and bias  in economics. So where does that leave us for our ruling? We can't tell you which side is right on the stimulus bill. But we do know that Obama is wrong when he says there is ""no disagreement that we need action by our government."" Clearly, there is disagreement. We rate his statement False.","[('CQ Transcripts Wire, ""Obama announces his national security team,"" Jan. 9, 2009', 'http://change.gov/newsroom/entry/american_recovery_and_reinvestment/'), (""Change.gov,  President-Elect Obama's weekly address  , Jan. 3, 2009"", 'No link'), ('Fox News Sunday,  transcript with Steny Hoyer  , Jan. 4, 2009', 'http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,475704,00.html'), ('Meet the Press,  transcript with Rahm Emanuel  , Jan. 18, 2009', 'No link'), ('The Cato Institute, ""  Fiscal Reality Central  ,"" accessed Feb. 2, 2009', 'http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28719411/'), ('Interview with Edward Prescott of Arizona State University, Jan. 30, 2009', 'No link'), ('New York Times, ""  Bad Faith Economics  ,"" by Paul Krugman, Jan. 25, 2009', 'http://www.cato.org/fiscalreality'), ('Cafe Hayek blog, ""  Stimulus Petition  ,"" by Russell Roberts, Jan. 29, 2009', 'No link'), ('EconTalk podcast, ""  Roberts (and Hanson) on Truth and Economics  ,"" Jan. 26, 2009', 'https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/26/opinion/26krugman.html')]",/factchecks/2009/jan/30/barack-obama/some-economists-disagree-obama/
