No, a CDC study did not find that mask mandates make no statistical difference on coronavirus rates
","A new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that widespread mask use significantly helped stem the spread of the coronavirus.  Yet a conservative news site claims that the study actually found the opposite, quoting two sentences out of context to make it appear that mask mandates had an insignificant effect on coronavirus case rates.  ""CDC: Mask Mandates Made No Statistical Difference,"" reads the headline of an article published in Texas Scorecard that is being shared widely on Facebook. The article was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We interviewed three public health experts familiar with the study and a spokesperson from the CDC. They were unanimous: The article’s reading of the study is off-base.  ""It’s not accurate at all to say that mask mandates played no role in decreasing COVID-19 case rates and deaths,"" said Cindy Prins, a clinical associate professor of epidemiology at the University of Florida College of Public Health and Health Professions. ""People are completely misunderstanding the study design if they are coming to that conclusion."" Both the study and the article were released as state governments considered lifting mask requirements, with five states — Texas, North Dakota, Mississippi, Iowa and Montana — opting to do so.  We reached out to the author of the article but did not hear back.  The main takeaway from the study was that ""mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates,"" said CDC spokesperson Jason McDonald.  This conclusion is stated multiple times in the agency’s study.  As evidence for its claims, the Texas Scorecard article quotes two sentences from the study out of context.  ""Daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period,"" reads the first.  The article takes the term ""reference period"" to refer to the period after the mask mandate was implemented. However, the report explicitly defines the ""reference period"" as the 20 days before the mask mandates started.  ""When the authors (of the CDC study) say ‘daily case and death growth rates before implementation of mask mandates were not statistically different from the reference period,’ they mean that rates 60-21 days before mandates were not statistically different from those 20-1 days before the mandate,"" explained Johns Hopkins epidemiologist Nikolas Wada.  The CDC study compared case rates from these two time periods to make sure that there wasn’t already a downward trend in coronavirus case and death rates before the mask mandate was implemented. According to McDonald, this helped the CDC to rule out other factors that could have accounted for the decrease.  The Texas Scorecard article also quotes the following sentence from the CDC study out of context: ""Changes in daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates were not statistically significant 1-20 and 21-40 days after restrictions were lifted.""  The sentence appears at a point in the study that discusses the effect of indoor dining on coronavirus case and death rates. Although the study found that allowing restaurants to serve customers initially had a statistically insignificant effect on coronavirus case rates, the effect did gradually become statistically significant sometime between the 41st and 60th day after dining restrictions were lifted. Other studies on mask mandates from the CDC and other sources have consistently found that widespread mask use decreases coronavirus case rates.  Texas Scorecard wrote that a CDC study found that ""Mask Mandates Made No Statistical Difference"" on coronavirus case rates.  That’s wrong and amounts to a ridiculous reading of a study that actually found the opposite: Mask mandates were associated with statistically significant decreases in county-level daily COVID-19 case and death growth rates.

Record turnouts after voter ID law passed? Not really
","Citing concerns over voter fraud, Wisconsin Republicans implemented a voter ID law in 2011 requiring photo identification before casting a ballot. Opponents blasted this as disenfranchisement, saying it disproportionately affected certain groups of voters and imposed unconstitutional barriers to voting. That prompted a yearslong legal battle that concluded only when the U.S. Supreme Court rejected a challenge to the law in 2015. With Republicans gearing up to push an array of new election law changes, state Sen. Duey Stroebel, R-Cedarburg, raised the voter ID topic in a recent TV interview. ""We’ve had more voter turnout since voter ID was passed than ever before,"" Stroebel, who is leading the effort to introduce the new limitations, said in a March 7, 2021, appearance on WISN-TV’s UpFront program. In other words, Stroebel is asserting the photo ID requirements that opponents on the left condemned as voter suppression in fact were followed by an increase in voting. Let’s see if he has a point. The first question is how we define turnout — a more complicated question than it might seem. It’s easy to bungle the data. For instance, while trying to make the case for widespread fraud in 2020, Donald Trump Jr. said voter turnout in Wisconsin had jumped from 67% in 2016 to 89%. But he calculated the two figures differently, and we rated the claim Pants on Fire. In defending Stroebel’s claim, his policy director, Brian Sikma, pointed to raw vote totals. But that’s a poor measure since the number of potential voters changes dramatically over time, due to population growth and other factors. Stroebel’s claim was that recent turnout is the highest ""ever,"" but Wisconsin has twice as many potential voters as it did in the 1960s. So we need a rate statistic — some reflection of the percentage of eligible people who voted, which allows us to compare different eras. Many states use registered voters for this calculation, but that’s a tough measure to use in Wisconsin since the state allows same-day voter registration. That creates a significant lag between knowing how many votes were cast and knowing how many people were registered, which clerks report well after the election.  But there are other problems as well. ""Some have argued that a strict voter ID law could actually discourage people from registering if those individuals believe that they lack proper ID to vote. If this sort or behavior occurs, then a law that reduces voter registration could misleadingly appear to produce higher turnout because fewer people are registered,"" said Barry Burden, director of the Elections Research Center at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. ""In a similar fashion, the actions taken by the (Wisconsin Elections Commission) over the past few years to remove outdated or incorrect registration records from the statewide database could lead to misleading conclusions about turnout rates."" Because of such concerns, the elections commission calculates turnout as the number of voters divided by the number of voting-age adults. We’ll lean on that for our analysis, along with a similar calculation that divides by the number of eligible voters (which removes non-citizens, felons and other ineligible voters from the total). Stroebel’s assertion is noteworthy since it is at odds with traditional wisdom on the subject — the expectation that adding requirements to voting will reduce the number of voters. Some form of voter ID is now required in 36 states, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. A 2014 report from the nonpartisan U.S. Government Accountability Office found the changes had a mixed impact on turnout. They examined 10 studies that analyzed turnout before and after voter ID was implemented in various states: five studies found no connection between the two, four found decreases in turnout and one found an increase in turnout. In a Wisconsin-specific study in 2017, Kenneth Mayer, a University of Wisconsin political science professor, estimated between 11,701 and 23,252 people did not vote in the 2016 presidential election because of confusion over voter ID requirements or lack of proper identification. Conservatives disputed that finding, however. Will Flanders, research director at the Wisconsin Institute for Law and Liberty, told the Wisconsin Center for Investigative Journalism in 2018 the study ""pushed a narrative"" of voter suppression but did not actually prove it. So did Wisconsin really post its highest-ever voter turnout in the years since voter ID took effect? Burden said presidential elections are the best way to gauge the law’s effect, since other elections have a lower turnout and involve voters who ""tend to be older, wealthier, more educated, and whiter, all factors that correlate with the likelihood of knowing about the law and possessing IDs."" We’ll start there, but will review all elections since Stroebel’s claim wasn’t specific to presidential contests. In 2012 — the last presidential election before voter ID — 70.1% of the voting-age population turned out. That dropped to 67.3% in 2016 under voter ID, then rose to 72.7% in 2020, according to the elections commission. The 2020 turnout figure is the third-highest since 1948, topped only by turnout around 73% in 1960 and 2004, according to data assembled by the elections commission. Turnout figures from the U.S. Elections Project — which calculates turnout based on eligible voters — showed 2020’s turnout was the highest since at least 1980, slightly edging 2004. But let’s look closer at 2016. Turnout rose overall in the U.S. that year to 60.1%, up from 58.6% in 2012, according to the Elections Project. So Wisconsin was bucking the national trend by declining in the first year of voter ID. Wisconsin had the second-largest decline in turnout in 2016 among the 50 states from 2012 to 2016. That’s a big mark against the narrative Stroebel is laying out. Taking a broader view, here’s how the other elections since 2016 stacked up, according to elections commission data: The gubernatorial elections, i.e. mid-term elections, show results in line with Stroebel’s claim. The 2018 turnout of 59.43% was the highest in the state dating back to 1950. That was part of a national surge, however. Nationwide turnout in that election was the highest overall since 1914 amid the polarizing tenure of President Donald Trump, according to the elections project. Turnout for the recent April presidential primaries has not been the highest ever. The 2016 turnout was fourth-highest since 1948, and 2020 was 10th-highest.  The August primary turnout was even lower compared to historical norms. Among the 2016, 2018 and 2020 elections, only the 2018 race was in the Top 10 since 1948.  The 2018 and 2019 spring elections, which were topped by Wisconsin Supreme Court contests, ranked second and third for turnout among the 10 contested races since 2010, but they were far short of the 2011 turnout in the race won by Justice David Prosser.  If we narrow our focus to just the few elections before and after voter ID (as in the chart above), we see turnout rose since 2016 in the gubernatorial elections, presidential primaries and partisan primaries, while it stayed largely stable in presidential elections and fell short of the recent high in the state Supreme Court race. But Stroebel didn’t just say turnout rose, he said it was the highest ever. And on that, he is off the mark. Stroebel said, ""We’ve had more voter turnout since voter ID was passed than ever before."" The implication baked into this claim is that the law must not have hampered voting if turnout was still historically high. But the data doesn’t make that case, especially since turnout rose in the U.S. overall in recent years. Turnout in the 2018 gubernatorial election was the highest ever — as part of a nationwide surge — but the other elections held since voter ID passed don’t show such a historic jump. And many weren’t close. In the presidential elections, turnout rose in 2020, but it dropped in 2016 even as voter turnout rose nationally. We define Mostly False as ""a statement that contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That fits here.",/factchecks/2021/mar/19/duey-stroebel/record-turnouts-after-voter-id-law-passed-not-real/
"['Energy', 'Missouri', 'Eric  Greitens']","
Greitens missed the mark with Keystone XL statement
","During a March 2 radio appearance on the Marc Cox Morning Show on 97.1 KTFK, Former Missouri Gov. Eric Greitens told listeners he’s evaluating the possibility of running for Senate in 2022. Such a run became more probable after Sen. Roy Blunt announced that he wouldn’t run for another term. While explaining his views and would-be platform, Greitens attacked President Joe Biden’s energy policy and praised former President Donald Trump’s. He specifically went after Biden for nixing the Keystone XL pipeline project. ""Look at what he did, for example, coming into office and killing the Keystone XL pipeline,"" Greitens said. ""Not only did he kill 11,000 jobs with the stroke of the pen, he also imperiled one of Donald Trump's most significant achievements, which was that we had achieved American energy independence under President Trump."" Repeated attempts to reach Greitens via his website and social media were unsuccessful.  On Biden’s first day as president, he signed an executive order revoking the permit for construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, an 875-mile pipeline that would have carried a heavy crude oil mixture from Alberta to Nebraska. This led to the project being suspended in the early days of construction. It was originally authorized by then-President Trump in March 2019 but met with criticism over its effect on the environment and its encroachment on indigenous peoples’ territory. PolitiFact has already looked at statements claiming that the order killed 11,000 jobs before and rated them Half True. But we wanted to take a closer look at the rest of Greitens’s statement. Achieving complete energy independence was one of Trump’s big campaign promises and something he worked for while in office. PolitiFact tracked most of Trump’s campaign promises, including this one — rating it a Compromise. There are two generally accepted definitions of energy independence. One says that energy independence occurs when the country produces more energy than it consumes. By that definition, the U.S. achieved energy independence in April 2019. The U.S. Energy Information Administration releases a monthly report tracking energy statistics. According to that report, the U.S. produced 7.918 quadrillion Btu in November 2020. (A Btu is a measurement of energy consistent with the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of a pound of water by 1 degree Fahrenheit.) In that same month, the U.S. consumed 7.603 quadrillion Btu. Some experts prefer a different definition of energy independence: no energy imports. Here, the U.S. doesn’t have to rely on other countries or be subject to global market disruptions. It’s independent from the global market. By this definition, the U.S. is far from achieving energy independence. The Energy Information Administration’s monthly report shows that the U.S. imported 1.598 quadrillion Btu in November 2020. But if the U.S. is producing more energy than it consumes, why is it importing energy? Well, much of the energy the U.S. produces is exported to other countries. Of the 7.918 quadrillion Btu the U.S. produced in November 2020, it exported 1.958 quadrillion. This left the country short of the 7.603 Btu Americans consumed that month, so energy was imported to make up the difference. So why does the U.S. export so much energy? According to the American Petroleum Institute, a group that represents the oil and gas industry, companies need to in order to refine it properly. Crude oil is not a consistent homogenous product, it says. Different types of crude oil — particularly those with different viscosities or sulfur levels — require different types of refinery infrastructure to process it properly. Not all of the oil extracted from U.S. soil can be processed well in the U.S. This claim circulated around social media in the days after Biden’s executive order and other similar actions. PolitiFact found it to be Mostly False. This claim relies on the notion that canceling the Keystone Pipeline would decrease American energy production.  However, the pipeline would be transporting oil extracted in Canada. Energy production is defined as the amount of primary energy extracted from nature, so this won’t affect the amount of energy the U.S. actually produces, only potentially the amount it imports and where it is imported from. Greitens said that when Biden canceled the Keystone XL pipeline, he ""imperiled one of Donald Trump's most significant achievements, which was that we had achieved American energy independence under President Trump."" According to one definition of energy independence, the U.S. achieved energy independence under Trump. Another definition says it means no net imports. Either way, his claim that Biden’s action threatened that energy independence doesn’t hold up. The action won’t affect U.S. energy production, only imports. We rate this Mostly False.",/factchecks/2021/mar/19/eric-greitens/greitens-missed-mark-keystone-xl-statement/

Fact-checking DeSantis on sanctuary cities, E-Verify laws
","Gov. Ron DeSantis said while the Biden administration has created a crisis at the border, Florida lawmakers have taken action on their own to address illegal immigration. ""When I became governor, we banned sanctuary cities and we also did E-Verify,"" Florida’s Republican governor said on Fox News, adding that he hoped such policies spread nationwide. ""Biden is going in the absolute wrong direction,"" DeSantis said. ""Trump had it right at the border, Biden has got it wrong."" DeSantis did sign laws to ban sanctuary cities and require some employers to use E-Verify, a federal program for employers to verify eligibility for employment. But he omits context about both bills. There is no official definition or list of sanctuary cities, and some cities or counties have pushed back on that label. There also isn't any uniform sanctuary policy. Broadly, jurisdictions are described as sanctuary cities when they have policies that restrict state or local police from assisting federal immigration officers; stop local or state officials from inquiring into a person's immigration status; or restrict information sharing between local or state law enforcement and federal authorities. Democrats have said that sanctuary cities don’t really exist, but that Republicans pretend they do to score political points. We found in 2018 that the fluidity of the definition plus legal challenges made it hard to determine if Florida had sanctuary cities or counties. In 2019, DeSantis signed a law prohibiting a local government entity from having a sanctuary policy. The law required county jails to enter into agreements with a federal immigration agency and do their best to support federal immigration law. Supporters of the bill said it would improve public safety. Opponents said it was discriminatory and would erode trust between law enforcement and immigrant communities. A spokesperson for DeSantis said that the legislation has deterred cities from choosing not to enforce federal immigration laws. A spokesperson for the Florida Sheriffs Association said that after SB 168 was signed into law, sheriffs updated their policies and entered into agreements with federal immigration officials, although some already had such agreements. ""The vast majority cooperated anyway,"" said Paul Chavez, an attorney at the Southern Poverty Law Center. ""It’s rare that a jurisdiction wouldn’t."" Before DeSantis signed the sanctuary cities ban, the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank favoring low levels of immigration, listed Florida’s Alachua and Clay counties and the city of West Palm Beach as being sanctuary jurisdictions, but all denied the label at the time. Now, there are no Florida communities listed. Both Alachua and Clay counties now have ""basic ordering agreements"" with ICE, as do most Florida counties. But Alachua’s sheriff spokesman Art Forgey said it was already the agency’s policy to give ICE access to inmates when in 2019 it signed a formal agreement to that effect in response to the new law. West Palm Beach reached an agreement with the Justice Department over its policies, and the city directed employees to share information with federal immigration officials. DeSantis campaigned on a promise to enact E-Verify for employers. E-Verify is a federal online program that allows enrolled employers to confirm the eligibility of their employees to work in the United States by matching information employees provide against Social Security and immigration records. Many states require the use of E-Verify for at least some employers. After resistance from business groups, DeSantis signed a bill in June 2020 that required E-Verify for public employers and contractors, but gave private employers a choice: They could use E-Verify or complete federally required employment eligibility forms and retain copies of the supporting documents. Many businesses already chose to retain those supporting documents, such as a passport, green card, driver’s license or birth certificate.  ""We have not seen a substantial difference with implementation of this law compared to what (employers) were doing previously,"" Gonzalez said. The Florida law required compliance by Jan. 1, 2021. There were about 66,000 Florida employers with E-Verify agreements as of Dec. 31, an increase from about 51,000 in 2019. But it’s unclear to what extent that relates to the new law or simply normal growth; there were about 41,000 in 2018. A bill introduced this session would mandate that all employers use E-Verify. DeSantis said ""when I became governor, we banned sanctuary cities and we also did E-Verify."" DeSantis did sign both bills, but omits context about both.  The bill he signed in 2019 banned local governments from having sanctuary policies. and required local jurisdictions to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement. But many jurisdictions already cooperated in such a manner before the law. The future of the law is uncertain due to a pending ruling from a federal judge regarding its legality. In 2020, DeSantis did sign a bill to require E-Verify for public employers and their contractors, but in his comments, the governor omitted that it didn’t apply to private employers who could instead use federal forms used to verify eligibility for employment.  The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information. We rate it Mostly True.

Yes, marijuana is stronger than it used to be
","Wisconsin Republicans have been blunt about their opposition to legalizing marijuana.  Gov. Tony Evers proposed legalizing recreational and medical marijuana in his 2021-’23 state budget as a way to bring in more revenue that he’d put toward rural schools and marginalized communities. Some GOP lawmakers have signaled they could support medical use, but the measure is not given much hope for passage.   State Rep. Barbara Dittrich, R-Oconomowoc, published a column on her legislative web page on Feb. 16, 2021 titled ""Gaslighting Marijuana"" that touched on a range of arguments against legalization. One line in particular caught our eye. ""There is the pervasive, false perception that marijuana is not dangerous,"" Dittrich wrote. ""Pot today is not the weed baby boomers were smoking."" Is Dittrich right that modern marijuana is different than the grass of Woodstock past? Dittrich’s argument centers around the amount of THC — the chemical that produces a high — in dried marijuana leaves and wax used for vaping devices. When asked for evidence to support her claim, an aide provided links to several articles about the drug and its health impacts. In 2015, Andy LaFrate of the marijuana testing lab Charas Scientific said the average potency of marijuana the lab tested had reached 20% THC — an increase from where it was 20 or 30 years prior. ""I would say the average potency of marijuana has probably increased by a factor of at least three,"" LaFrate said in a video from the American Chemical Society.  That tracks with other research done on this topic. One study in 2019 found marijuana potency on average increased from 8.9% in 2008 to 17.1% in 2017. Another group of researchers indicated THC amounts were as low as 4% in 1995.  By contrast, THC content reached 22% and 67% in parts of the Netherlands, according to a study in Europe. Products with an average potency of 14% represented most of the London street market, while Italy, France and Spain saw marijuana with less than 10% THC. Today’s potency depends in part on whether the marijuana comes from the legal or black market, said Susan Weiss, director of the Division of Extramural Research at the National Institute on Drug Abuse. Marijuana recently seized by the Drug Enforcement Administration tests between 12 to 14% on average, she said, compared to 3% or less in the 1970s and 1980s. But dispensaries sell products with up to 20% THC. The change over time can be attributed to several factors, Weiss said: Marijuana back in the day was largely imported from Mexico, and potency would have decreased as it sat before being distributed. People also know more about the genetics of the plant now and can grow it in more controlled environments. Plus, the demand exists for a stronger product. ""Just as you can breed for better tomatoes, you can breed for higher potency plants,"" Weiss said. Marijuana users also have more options today by way of concentrates like wax and oil that can be used for vaping — which are even stronger than dried cannabis.  In 2014, the head of the DEA told lawmakers that the THC content of those products averaged 54%, with some as high as 99%. According to NIDA, solvent-based products range on average from 54 to 69% THC, while non-solvent products have levels between 39 to 60%. In a column, Dittrich said ""pot today is not the weed baby boomers were smoking."" Research shows that the THC content of marijuana has increased significantly since the 1970s amid shifting trends in the industry and a greater understanding of the cannabis plant.  We rate Dittrich’s claim True.   ",/factchecks/2021/mar/19/barbara-dittrich/yes-marijuana-stronger-it-used-be/

There’s no denying that it looks strange. But it doesn’t prove he’s talking in front of a green screen.  Steve Herman, a Voice of America reporter who was holding one of the microphones, tweeted about the rumors on March 17.  ""I was the one holding the lighter-colored fuzzy microphone and thus literally in front of @POTUS on the South Lawn,"" Herman wrote. ""It’s all real."" Herman also shared a video created by Mick West, who writes about conspiracy theories.

The effect is the same. ""It does look weird, but once you understand what’s going on, it’s pretty obvious,"" he says in the video. Herman noted in an email to PolitiFact that, even when there's not a pandemic, the booms are regularly used during outdoor helicopter talks due to challenging acoustics.  Other images from that day show the president, microphones and reporters from other angles.  In this Reuters image, taken by photographer Tom Brenner, Biden can be seen from the side talking to reporters who are standing several feet away with their microphones extended forward.

On March 13, he tweeted, ""70% of Georgians said they would vote for Trump in 2024."" ""And 55.5% disapprove of the job Biden is doing,"" Huckabee continued. ""Makes you wonder how Biden could have won Georgia, but you’d better not wonder that out loud.""   This post, which was also shared as a screenshot on Facebook, was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) We reached out to Huckabee seeking a source for the figures he cited but did not hear back.  He appears to be quoting the results of a Georgia statewide survey conducted over a few days in March by the Trafalgar Group. The Georgia-based polling company released the results in a report on March 12, a day before Huckabee’s tweet. But Huckabee’s tweet suggests that 70% of all Georgians — including Democrats — favor Donald Trump for president in 2024. That’s not what the poll report says. The results on support for the former president as a 2024 candidate included ""only likely GOP primary voters.""  And 70% of that group said they would ""absolutely vote for Trump"" if he were to run in the Republican presidential primary that year. The group surveyed 1,093 respondents, including likely 2022 general election voters and GOP primary voters, the report says. The likely 2022 general election voters were not necessarily Republicans, according to Trafalgar, whose chief pollster is a veteran Republican strategist, Robert Cahaly. But some of the survey’s questions were asked only of likely Republican voters.  The report says that 55.5% of respondents disapprove ""of how Joe Biden is handling the job of president,"" as Huckabee said in his tweet. That rating ""was among all likely 2022 general election voters regardless of party history of affiliation,"" according to Trafalgar. Biden won Georgia with 49.5% of the vote, beating Trump by about 12,000 votes. Georgia certified the results after a hand recount and audit.  Cahaly incorrectly predicted that Trump would win the 2020 election, but in 2016, Trafalgar’s state surveys ""most effectively presaged Mr. Trump’s upset win,"" the New York Times reported. The firm doesn’t disclose its polling methods, the newspaper said in November. We couldn’t find other recent polls showing Biden’s approval rating in Georgia. According to FiveThirtyEight, which averages multiple Biden-approval polls, 52.9% of likely or registered voters in the United States approved of the president as of March 17, and 40.9% disapproved. A new poll from PBS NewsHour, NPR and the Marist Institute for Public Opinion found that about half of Americans said they approve of how Biden has served as president so far and 42% disapproved. Our ruling Huckabee said that 70% of Georgians said they would vote for Trump in 2024.  That’s not the case. According to the Trafalgar Group’s poll, the 70% support for Trump was among likely Republican primary voters.  We rate this post False. ",/factchecks/2021/mar/18/mike-huckabee/huckabee-post-misstates-georgia-survey-results-sup/

GOP’s McCarthy wrongly accuses Democrats of destroying 1 million energy jobs
","House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy took to Fox News to highlight the damage purportedly wrought by Democrats since President Joe Biden took office. He summarized his comments in a tweet. ""Democrats have accomplished a lot in just 2 months,"" McCarthy tweeted March 14. ""Higher gas prices. Biden's border crisis. 1 Million energy jobs destroyed."" Democrats have accomplished a lot in just 2 months:❌ Higher gas prices❌ Biden's border crisis❌ 1 Million energy jobs destroyedAnd they’re just getting started. pic.twitter.com/8gUGmL0QFL The press of unaccompanied minors and families at the Mexico border is real. Gas prices have gone up, though most of the increase took place under President Donald Trump, and is driven by an improving economy and global oil markets, rather than Washington policy. McCarthy’s statement about 1 million energy jobs, which he also made in the Fox News interview, is way off. We reached out to McCarthy’s office for an explanation and did not hear back. The 1 million figure in his claim number aligns with a forecast from the American Petroleum Institute, a group that represents the oil and gas industry, but McCarthy misrepresented what the number means. In September, the American Petroleum Institute wrote that under a total ban on oil and gas leasing, ""nearly one million jobs would be lost by 2022."" Here’s why that doesn’t back up McCarthy’s claim: The study assumed all new leasing and new drilling on existing leases for oil and gas on federally controlled land and waters would stop completely. The Biden administration fulfilled its campaign promise to put new leasing on hold, but production on current leases continues uninterrupted. Plus, there are over 7,000 approved drilling permits that oil and gas companies have yet to use.  The study estimated total job losses, not energy job losses. The underlying model forecast a decline in the national economy, and translated that into an overall decline in employment. McCarthy spoke of 1 million energy jobs. It is a projection, and as the underlying study itself noted, projections ""are not predictions of what will happen, but rather modeled projections of what may happen."" McCarthy’s statement holds Democrats responsible for hypothetical results as if they’ve actually taken place. Philip Jordan with BW Research tracks jobs in the energy sector for the National Association of State Energy Officials. Jobs in the oil, gas and coal industries have declined due to the pandemic downturn, Jordan said, but that was about 120,000 jobs, and took place before Biden took office. Jordan said that McCarthy’s number is implausible on its face. ""The total of fossil fuel industries combined have about 1.6 million jobs,"" Jordan said. ""A million energy jobs lost? I think the math is impossible."" McCarthy said in the past two months, Democrats led by Biden have ""destroyed 1 million energy jobs."" The 1 million figure matches a number from an American Petroleum Institute report, but that report assumed all new oil and gas development on federal property would cease, while the Biden policy affects only new leasing. And the projected job losses were across the entire economy — not solely in energy. McCarthy spoke as if the jobs were actually lost in the past two months, but the figure came from a projection, which might never come to pass.

Maria Bartiromo conflates Trump’s Georgia calls in primetime interview
","Fox News host Maria Bartiromo conflated the details of two post-election calls former President Donald Trump had with Georgia election officials, wrongly claiming that the Washington Post walked back its reporting on Trump’s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. The Washington Post issued a high-profile correction to a Jan. 9 report about another phone call between Trump and a different Georgia official, Frances Watson. But the Post has not changed its reporting on Trump’s Jan. 2 call with Raffensperger, which was backed by audio of the call. As she interviewed Trump on March 16, Bartiromo suggested that the facts surrounding Trump’s hour-long call with Raffensperger were also up in the air. That’s not true. ""Let's talk about the Washington Post and what took place yesterday, with the Washington Post being forced to correct what you told the secretary of state of Georgia,"" Bartiromo said.  There’s no debate over what Trump told Raffensperger on Jan. 2. The full audio of the call confirmed the Post’s Jan. 3 report describing it. With other people on the line, Trump was recorded pressuring Raffensperger to ""find"" enough votes to flip the election as he recycled debunked claims about dead and ineligible voters, mystery ballots, rigged machines and other allegations of fraud. ""I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state,"" Trump told Raffensperger, wrongly insisting that he won the swing state. Bartiromo also said in her interview with Trump that the since-corrected report came ""right before the Senate race"" in Georgia that tipped control of the chamber to the Democrats. That’s also wrong. The report that was recently corrected was published on Jan. 9, days after the state’s Jan. 5 runoff elections. On her show March 17, Bartiromo said during an interview with Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, that she had confused the two calls. ""I misspoke last night and said that the call in question was a call between President Trump and the secretary of state of Georgia,"" Bartiromo said. ""No, no, no. It wasn’t. It was President Trump and a Georgia election official."" In January, the Washington Post published two major stories about Trump’s efforts to pressure Georgia’s election officials to overturn the state’s results. The separate reports focused on two different phone calls involving two different election officials. The first report, published Jan. 3, detailed Trump’s call with Raffensperger. The Post published the full audio and transcript of that call. Its Jan. 3 story was never corrected.  Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger speaks during a news conference in Atlanta on Nov. 11, 2020. (AP) The second report, published Jan. 9, said Trump had a similar call in December with Watson, Georgia’s chief elections investigator. Citing an anonymous state official, the Post reported that Trump told Watson she should ""find the fraud,"" and that she’d be a ""national hero"" if she did.  A recording of that call, first reported March 11 by the Wall Street Journal, was later located. The audio reveals that Trump did not urge Watson to ""find the fraud.""  Rather, the former president is heard telling Watson to uncover the ""dishonesty"" in signatures on absentee ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, which covers most of Atlanta. He said in the call that ""when the right answer comes out, you’ll be praised."" In her March 17 follow-up, Bartiromo said the ""bigger story"" was that the Post reported that Trump told Watson to ""find the fraud"" when, she argued, he ""didn’t say anything at all like that."" The Post has since identified the anonymous source who provided the quotes as Jordan Fuchs, Georgia’s deputy secretary of state. Fuchs told Washington Post media columnist Erik Wemple that she believed the report accurately reflected Watson’s interpretation of the call.  ""The only mistake here was in the direct quotes, and they should have been more of a summary,"" Fuchs is quoted as saying in Wemple’s March 16 column. ""I think it’s pretty absurd for anybody to suggest that the president wasn’t urging the investigator to ‘find the fraud.’"" The Post on March 11 appended a lengthy correction to its original report about Trump’s call with Watson, acknowledging that it had ""misquoted Trump’s comments."" But in her interview with Trump, Bartiromo muddled the details around that correction, giving the false impression that what we know about Trump’s call with Raffensperger was also discredited. ""The Washington Post initially accused you of a crime, based on fabricating quotes, and the rest of the media ran with it,"" Bartiromo said, before reading from the Post’s correction. ""I know you put out a statement about this story, Mr. President. But tell us what your reaction is that the Washington Post had to correct this fake news that they reported that you told the secretary of state of Georgia to find the fraud and find the votes right before the Senate race."" Responding to Bartiromo, Trump said the Post’s report ""probably affected the Senate race"" that sent two Democrats to the Senate — even though the runoff election for those seats took place on Jan. 5, days before the Post published its report on Trump’s call with Watson. Bartiromo said that the Washington Post was ""forced to correct what (Trump) told the secretary of state of Georgia."" That’s inaccurate. The Washington Post issued a correction about a separate report detailing the contents of a different call Trump had with a different Georgia official, Watson. But the newspaper has not changed its reporting on Trump’s Jan. 2 call with Raffensperger, the secretary of state. The report that was corrected came after the Georgia Senate runoffs and therefore had no bearing on the outcome of that election. We rate Bartiromo’s claim False.

No, an image of a White House Rose Garden event wasn’t taken at a film studio in Georgia

The White House confirmed that the photo was taken on March 12, during the signing ceremony of the American Rescue Plan, the $1.9 trillion COVID-19 relief bill.  As can be seen in the photograph displayed in the post, Associated Press images of the event show House Speaker Nancy Pelosi in the same pink dress, Biden in a blue suit, and Vice President Kamala Harris and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer both wearing black.

"['Infrastructure', 'Negative Campaigning', 'Kelly Loeffler']","
Loeffler attacks Collins for increasing taxes with Stacey Abrams. The reality is more nuanced.
","As they battle for a Georgia Senate seat, Republicans Sen. Kelly Loeffler and Rep. Doug Collins have each adopted an unorthodox campaign strategy: tying the other to Democrat Stacey Abrams.  A new attack ad released by the Loeffler campaign follows this tack, claiming that Collins voted with the state’s former Democratic gubernatorial candidate to raise taxes when they were both state representatives.  ""Doug Collins repeatedly joined liberal Stacey Abrams to raise taxes,"" the ad claims, with text citing HR 206, a bill to fund infrastructure projects. The ad then goes on to refer to HR 206 as ""the largest tax increase in Georgia history"" and concludes by saying that ""Kelly’s never voted for a tax increase — and never will."" While the ad makes claims that are accurate, it also leaves out crucial context about HR 206 and Loeffler’s own position on it.  In 2009, the Georgia State Assembly was deadlocked over two transportation bills: HR 206 and HB 277. The bills, which complemented each other, allowed Georgia voters to decide whether to adopt a statewide 1-cent sales tax increase to fund infrastructure improvements. Proponents of the bill, including Republican business-owners, noted that Georgia spent less on transportation than almost every other state and that its crumbling infrastructure was discouraging investment.  As the ad claims, both Collins and Abrams supported HR 206 and HB 277 when they were state representatives. Collins was quoted in the Gainesville Times supporting ""the state-wide approach"" to taxation.  However, HR 206 and HB 277 did not actually constitute a tax increase per se. Instead, they punted the decision to Georgia voters, who would be asked in a statewide ballot whether they wanted to amend the state constitution to allow the tax. The ad’s claim that Collins ""joined liberal Stacey Abrams to raise taxes"" is therefore misleading.  HR 206 and HB 277 passed the House but stalled in the Senate, where they were fought over, amended, and kicked from committee to committee. In 2010, HB 277 was finally passed – as The Atlanta Journal-Constitution wrote – ""as if it were a billion-dollar kidney stone.""  By the time it passed, HB 277 had changed significantly. Instead of calling for a statewide vote, the bill split Georgia into 12 regions and asked residents of each region to vote in a referendum on whether to enact the tax for projects within that region.  Loeffler, then an Atlanta businesswoman and co-owner of the Atlanta Dream WNBA franchise, supported one of the regional tax increases that the bills put on the ballot. Along with other sports executives, Loeffler was quoted in the Henry Herald promoting the sales tax in the Atlanta regional referendum:  ""This is about sports and competition and improving the fan experience,"" Loeffler told the Herald, in reference to the tax hike. ""There is no other option for creating jobs in this way right now."" Loeffler did more than simply voice her support for the tax. According to campaign finance records, the company led by Loeffler’s husband, of which she was a senior executive, donated $100,000 to a political committee backing the sales tax increase.  The Loeffler campaign said that the attack ad was referring to Collins’ vote for HR 206 and HB 277 before they had been amended to include the regional referenda. Since Loeffler supported the regional tax increase rather than the statewide tax that Collins and Abrams favored, she is not taking an inconsistent position, the campaign said.  ""Kelly supported the 2012 regional [referendum] that allowed communities to vote individually for and fund projects of importance in their own communities,"" wrote Loeffler spokesman Stephen Lawson in an email. ""Doug Collins voted to tax south Georgia for Atlanta's traffic problems by voting for the statewide, one-size-fits-all approach.""  In support of Lawson’s claims, the Loeffler campaign ad does specifically cite Collins’ vote on the version of HR 206 that endorsed a statewide, not regional tax referendum. But the reality is that Georgia taxes did not actually increase statewide because of Collins’ vote on HR 206.  The Loeffler campaign ad makes a series of claims about the transportation bills HR 206 and HB 277. These claims leave out crucial context about Collins’ voting record and Loeffler’s own position on similar tax increases.  The first part of the claim, ""Doug Collins repeatedly joined liberal Stacey Abrams to raise taxes"" does not strictly apply to the bill that the ad calls ""the greatest tax increase in Georgia history."" As noted above, HR 206 would not have levied a statewide tax per se. Instead, it left the ultimate decision on the tax up to Georgia voters.  The second part of the claim, ""Kelly’s never voted for a tax increase — and never will,"" is also misleading. As a citizen, Loeffler publicly supported a regional transportation tax, saying it was necessary to create jobs.  We rate this claim Mostly False. ​",/factchecks/2020/aug/17/kelly-loeffler/loeffler-attacks-collins-increasing-taxes-stacey-a/

Trump Claims California Lawmaker Pushed To ‘Abolish Single-Family Zoning.’ Is He Right?
","President Donald Trump and U.S. Housing Secretary Ben Carson claimed yesterday that a California state lawmaker is trying to ""abolish single-family zoning"" in the state. ""For the past three years, the state senator who represents Speaker Nancy Pelosi’s San Francisco, has led a push to abolish single-family zoning in California,"" Trump and Carson wrote about state Sen. Scott Wiener, D–San Francisco, in an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal titled ""We’ll Protect America’s Suburbs.""  Wiener, called the op-ed ""racist,"" and said it attacks him ""for fighting to legalize affordable housing in neighborhoods zoned to only allow single-family housing."" ""This is an ugly and desperate attempt to appeal to white suburbanites, whom they fear are going to vote for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris this November,"" Wiener said in a press release on Monday.  Last month, the Trump administration rescinded the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing mandate. That Obama-era rule required communities that receive grants and housing aid to assess racial segregation in housing and offer plans to correct it. Advocates criticized the move, saying it would make it harder to bring lawsuits alleging discrimination in housing, while conservative groups said it would stop frivolous lawsuits. Politics aside, we wanted to know more about Trump and Carson’s claim on housing in California. Is there really a push to ""abolish single-family zoning"" in the state? Or did they stretch the truth?  We set out on a fact check.  Our research Like much in California’s housing world, the claim from Trump and Carson is confusing.  From the viewpoint of housing and zoning experts, the administration’s claim is technically accurate but needs a lot of explaining and could be interpreted as misleading.  In recent years, Wiener led the push to pass legislation to allow for greater housing density in California to meet the state’s lack of supply.  His most recent effort, Senate Bill 50, stalled out in the Democratic-controlled Legislature earlier this year. Previous versions also failed.  SB 50 would have required cities and counties to permit higher-density zoning near job and transit centers. But housing experts say that legislation doesn’t fit with Trump’s dark narrative about Democrats wanting to ""destroy the suburbs,"" noting vast tracts of single-family homes would still be permitted across California communities. In neighborhoods within a half mile of rail stations, ferry terminals and other transit hubs, this ""upzoning"" would greenlight mid-rise apartment towers of four or five stories. In spots farther from transit and jobs, it would permit dividing homes into duplexes, triplexes and fourplexes in areas previously zoned only for single-family homes.   Earlier in the op-ed, Trump and Carson claim that, if left in place, the federal housing rule they rescinded would also ""abolish single-family zoning, compel the construction of high-density ‘stack and pack’ apartment buildings in residential neighborhoods, and forcibly transform neighborhoods.""  This gives the impression that the failed California legislation would do the same. But under the state bill, the private market would drive the construction of higher-density housing, not government. Local governments would not be compelled to build anything. And large tracts of single-family homes would still be permitted. Among experts, a zoning designation communicates the maximum density that can be built on a property, but it doesn’t mean other less-dense options, such as single-family homes, are off limits.  Of course, not everyone who reads the op-ed is a housing or zoning expert and they might be left with a very different impression, including the idea that there’s a push to abolish new single-family homes in California, which is not the case. Here’s one viewpoint from a housing expert:  ""I think it is accurate,"" Ben Metcalf, managing director of UC Berkeley’s Terner Center for Housing Innovation, said of the claim. ""There has been a longstanding effort over the last several years, among folks like Sen. Scott Wiener and other leaders in the Legislature and in the governor’s office, under Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov. Gavin Newsom, to try and create more flexibility for individual homeowners who want to add second units or third units or want to subdivide their lots.""  But, as Metcalf explained, abolishing single-family zoning doesn’t mean getting rid of the ability to build new single-family homes.  ""In President Trump and Secretary Carson’s op-ed, they are definitely doing some fear mongering here, making folks think that,"" said Metcalf, who led California’s Department of Housing and Community Development from 2015 to last year, and served in President Obama’s housing agency. ""The implication here is, we here in California are trying to do away with the ability of folks to own and live in single-family homes. That’s just not it at all."" ""I think it’s a major misconception and Trump and Carson are driving a bus through that misconception,"" Metcalf added. ‘No one is proposing to ban single-family homes’ In an interview on Monday, Wiener also said the claim was correct from a zoning perspective, but added a similar caveat.  ""By eliminating single-family home zoning, all we’re saying is people will get to choose if they want to build a single-family home or 2-unit building or a 3-unit building or whatever. It’s about giving people more latitude,"" Wiener said. ""No one is proposing to ban single-family homes. Single-family homes are a very important part of our housing stock."" Jenny Schuetz, who studies housing policy at the Brookings Institute, a Washington, D.C., think tank, wrote in an email that ""people who aren't housing nerds (as Ben Metcalf, Sen. Wiener and I all are) find ‘abolish single-family zoning’ confusing. It sometimes gets repeated as ‘abolish (or ban) single-family homes’, which implies that someone will take a wrecking ball to existing homes. Not the same thing at all!"" Scheutz added that SB 50, if it had passed, ""would be a very far cry from abolishing single-family zoning in California. SB50 would have applied to a limited set of geographic areas, mostly around transit stations and designated ‘job-rich’ communities."" Our rating President Trump and Housing Secretary Ben Carson claimed that state Sen. Scott Wiener ""has led a push to abolish single-family zoning in California"" over the past three years.  Wiener and housing experts say the claim is technically correct. In recent years, the lawmaker championed bills to allow for more apartments on land now zoned only for single-family homes. But they also say the statement takes things out of context and could be misleading.  Among zoning experts, ""abolishing"" single-family zoning means to allow additional, higher-density options on the same property but not to eliminate the ability to build single-family homes. For others, however, the claim could be interpreted as ending the right to build single-family homes across the state or in parts of it.  That was never proposed. Trump and Carson say nothing about that key information, leaving a potentially misleading impression.  We rate the claim Half True.  HALF TRUE – The statement is partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context.",/factchecks/2020/aug/17/donald-trump/trump-claims-california-lawmaker-pushed-abolish-si/

No, Kamala Harris didn’t say this about guns
","Sen. Kamala Harris has taken a strong stance on gun control, but has she actually threatened to send police to your house to take your guns? The short answer is no. But that hasn’t stopped social media users from spreading a fabricated quote attributed to her that suggests otherwise. ""If elected & you don’t surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door,"" reads a post attributed to Harris, the newly selected running mate for presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden. Harris didn’t say this. And there is no evidence Harris plans to force people to surrender their guns. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The claim appears to be a mischaracterization of a pledge Harris made during a CNN Presidential Town Hall in April 2019.  ""Upon being elected, I will give the United States Congress 100 days to get their act together and have the courage to pass reasonable gun safety laws, and if they fail to do it, then I will take executive action,"" Harris said during the town hall.  Harris continued, clarifying what her executive action would encompass.  ""And specifically what I will do is put in place a requirement that for anyone who sells more than five guns a year, they are required to do background checks when they sell those guns,"" Harris said. ""I will require that for any gun dealer that breaks the law, the ATF take their license."" During the town hall, Harris did not discuss confiscating guns using law enforcement officers. What’s more, a commitment to use ""executive action"" can refer to more than just executive orders, as the Washington Post reported. At another campaign event in August 2019 in Las Vegas, Harris reiterated her pledge to take action on guns within 100 days of taking office. At that event, she said she would also use executive action to implement ""a ban on the importation of assault rifles into our country."" In a follow-up question, Harris was asked what enforcement of an assault rifles ban might look like. A reporter is heard off-camera asking, ""Does it involve law enforcement essentially going to people’s houses looking for specific banned guns? Does it involve perhaps creating a database of people who are legal gun owners? What kind of process are we talking about here?"" Harris answered by referencing her experience as attorney general in California, when she said law enforcement was permitted to confiscate guns by going to the doors of people who were both ""found by a court to be a danger to themselves and others"" and were also ""on a list where they were precluded and prohibited from owning a gun because of a conviction.""   ""I have to stress, lawful gun ownership, that is one thing. We’re talking about something else and we have to stop conflating and blending all these issues,"" Harris said.  Harris did not say she planned to send law enforcement officers to the homes of all gun owners, as the post suggests.  When we first spotted the false quote being shared Aug. 11 on a Facebook page called YET-iheart-NRA, PolitiFact reached out to the page administrator to ask what evidence they had to support the claim. Someone with the Facebook page responded, pointing us to an article from the blog Law Enforcement Today. That article referenced an exchange between Biden and Harris in the September 2019 Democratic presidential primary debate, found here.  In it, debate moderator David Muir of ABC’s World News Tonight pointed out that Harris said she planned to use executive action to ban imports of AR-15 assault weapons if Congress did not act quickly enough. Muir explained that Biden had expressed doubts about the future president’s ""constitutional authority"" to ban assault weapons via executive order, which Harris had not committed to doing.  When asked if Biden’s stated concern had a point, Harris jokingly replied, ""I mean I would just say, ‘Hey Joe, instead of saying no we can’t, let’s say yes we can.’"" Here again, there is no evidence she made the statement that is being attributed to her. (The post made by YET-iheart-NRA appears to have been removed since we inquired about it.) Other fact-checking organizations debunked similar claims that circulated online in 2019, but Harris’ new role as vice presidential candidate caused the claim to reemerge. Fact-checking organizations have continued debunking the claim after it reappeared. A post claims that vice presidential candidate Sen. Kamala Harris said, ""If elected & you don’t surrender your guns, I will sign an executive order & the police will show up at your door."" This quote is fabricated.

No, Wisconsin mailbox picture isn’t proof of “massive voter suppression”
","President Donald Trump has openly said he opposes emergency funding for the U.S. Postal Service because he doesn’t want to see it used for mail-in voting.  ""They need that money in order to make the Post Office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,"" Trump told Fox News on Aug. 13, 2020, reiterating his frequent and false claim that mail-in voting is rife with fraud. And that has opened the conspiracy floodgates. It gave life to a long-running claim his opponent, Democrat Joe Biden, and others have made for months that Trump wants to limit the Postal Service to restrain mail-in voting. (Democrats have long been perceived to benefit most from mail-in voting, and a Marquette Law School poll released Aug. 11, 2020, confirmed this in Wisconsin, showing Biden leading by 67 points among those planning to vote absentee by mail.) And it triggered an avalanche of allegations and news coverage about various Postal Service actions, from removing sorting machines to pulling mailboxes off the streets. One claim that drew a particularly large audience is built around a picture of stacks of mailboxes. The picture — described as originating in Wisconsin — has taken off across Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Reddit and elsewhere, being shared hundreds of thousands of times and viewed millions of times within a few days of the earliest posts on Aug. 14, 2020. The most widespread version on Facebook is a screenshot of an Aug. 15, 2020, tweet that describes the picture this way: ""Photo taken in Wisconsin. This is happening right before our eyes. They are sabotaging USPS to sabotage vote by mail. This is massive voter suppression and part of their plan to steal the election."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Are these really mailboxes rounded up to suppress mail-in voting? Let’s review the evidence. The one accurate element in this claim is that the picture is from Wisconsin. The earliest version of this picture we could find — hat tip to twitter user @ushadrons, one of many online sleuths looking into this claim — surfaced at noon central time Aug. 14, 2020. It simply included the caption ""Whole thing looks terrible."" A followup comment noted it was from Wisconsin. Another Reddit user posted the same picture an hour later labeled as ""Harford, Wisconsin today,"" misspelling the name of Hartford. Ensuing claims about voter suppression drew pushback from another user, who posted a picture of himself at the company gate, noting he lives one minute away in Hartford. His picture showed a man standing outside a very similar-looking fence with a Hartford Finishing Inc. sign on it and a very similar stack of mailboxes in the background.  By all accounts, this location is correct. Hartford Finishing — in businesses since 1986 with about 220 current employees — has a contract with the Postal Service to refurbish old mailboxes. The business specializes in powder painting systems. Job ads the company posted in 2018 were for positions that specialize in ""blues postal mailboxes."" The Postal Service confirms the working relationship. The company did not immediately respond to an email seeking comment, but Street View images from Google Maps show stacks of mailboxes are a regular occurrence there. A picture taken in August 2019 shows stacks far larger than the one in the viral image, in fact. The fence and gate mechanism in Street View images from 2013 and 2019 match exactly the fence and gate shown on the viral image. The gate and buildings also match the image posted by the Reddit user in Hartford. The core question then is whether the existence of these boxes at the company proves any kind of voter suppression. That’s the heart of the claim we’re checking here and many others connected to this picture online. ""THEY AREN’T EVEN TRYING TO HIDE IT NOW,"" actress Jeri Ryan said in a Facebook post sharing the Hartford image. One Twitter user claimed Postmaster General Louis DeJoy — a controversial recent Trump appointee — was committing a felony. Another called it ""clear evidence of illegal voting suppression."" But they’re all wrong. Claims in this vein have surfaced around the country in response to images of other mailboxes stacked on the ground or on flatbed trucks. The Postal Service has said these are part of long-running, standard practices. Little-used boxes are removed (after a public notice is posted on them) and dilapidated boxes are replaced with new ones, while the old ones then go in for refinishing. Here’s the full response from the Postal Service when we asked them about the Hartford picture. The Postal Service reviews collection box density every year on a routine basis to identify redundant/seldom used collection boxes as First-Class Mail volume continues to decline. Based on the density testing, boxes are identified for potential removal and notices are placed on boxes to give customers an opportunity to comment before the removal decision is made. This process is one of the many ways the Postal Service makes adjustments to our infrastructure to match our resources to declining mail volumes. Given the recent customer concerns the Postal Service will postpone removing boxes for a period of 90 days while we evaluate our customers’ concerns. The photo in question is of a vendor we have done business with for several years. They are a contractor that repairs or destroys old collection boxes. They now make new collection boxes also. Photos such as this appear every couple of years. In response to the widespread social-media blowback, the Postal Service said Aug. 14, 2020, it was suspending all removal operations until after the election, the Washington Post reported. A viral picture circulating on social media says a picture of stacked mailboxes is proof of voter suppression in Wisconsin. The picture is from Wisconsin, taken at a Hartford company, but it’s not proof of anything nefarious. USPS contracts with Hartford Finishing to repair or destroy old mailboxes. The mailboxes shown could have been removed — after a public notice — due to lack of use (following a long-established process), or they could have been replaced with new boxes due to their condition.

GOP Senate ad misrepresents Montana governor’s stance on rural hospitals, public option
","An attack ad, which was released in mid-July, states that Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, a Democratic candidate for the Senate, supports a government-run health care program that would wreak havoc on the state’s health care infrastructure.   ""Bullock’s health care plan will force rural hospitals to close. Medicare as we know it will change, replaced by a government-run program with fewer doctors and longer wait times,"" says the narrator in the dark and grainy advertisement paid for by the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC).  Bullock is running against first-term incumbent Republican Sen. Steve Daines in a race viewed as a toss-up. Given the COVID-19 pandemic, both candidates have been focusing on health issues.  Because this race is critical to determining whether Democrats or Republicans control the Senate, and considering that its themes are likely to be repeated in many congressional campaigns, we thought it was important to check the ad’s validity.  We first asked the NRSC for the evidence on which the ad was based. A spokesperson pointed to Bullock’s support for a ""public option"" health plan and provided us with a report predicting this proposal’s negative impact on rural hospitals, as well as quotes from both Republicans and Democrats about how the public option could lead to the eventual implementation of a ""Medicare for All"" program. (Medicare for All refers to the single-payer health system, advocated by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, which would eliminate private insurance and replace it with a government-run health care system.) We also reached out to the Bullock campaign for its response.  In a statement, Sean Manning, spokesperson for Montanans for Bullock said, ""The claims in this ad are false. Montana hasn't lost one rural hospital under Governor Bullock, and he will continue to support policies that protect rural hospitals while making affordable healthcare available to all Montanans in the Senate."" (According to the University of North Carolina Sheps Center for Health Services Research, no rural hospitals have closed in Montana since 2005.)  The ad vaguely refers to Bullock’s ""health care plan"" but doesn’t say outright what the candidate supports.  According to Bullock’s campaign website, he supports the creation of a public option.  A public option is generally defined as a health plan administered by the federal government that exists alongside and competes with private health insurance plans on the Affordable Care Act exchanges. Public option proposals differ by political candidate, and can take various forms, including Medicare or Medicaid buy-ins as well as a new government-run entity.   Opponents of such plans say that a public option, which would have the scale and regulatory power of the federal government to set lower reimbursement rates to providers, would have a competitive advantage and could put private insurance companies out of business. This would leave Americans with only one choice ― government-backed insurance. But that conclusion is debatable. Some health care scholars argue a public option would increase competition, leading to expanded access to health coverage, lower health care costs and lower premiums for consumers.  In the end, the outcomes from implementing this approach are difficult to predict unless a specific plan is released, said Benedic Ippolito, a health care research scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. ""Things can be radically different based on what the public option looks like,"" said Ippolito. ""The two big variables are, who is covered? And how does that insurer actually pay health care providers? You can imagine two public options looking totally different.""  Now to tackle the first part of the ad, which says that ""Bullock’s health care plan will force rural hospitals to close.""  This argument stems from the idea that a public option would lead to lower reimbursement rates, based on the model provided by Medicare, which pays less than private insurance. And, because many rural hospitals are already severely financially strapped, lowered payments would do them in, the argument goes. When we asked the NRSC for the evidence to support this position, a spokesperson provided an August 2019 study conducted by Navigant, a consulting firm. The study was commissioned by the Partnership for America’s Healthcare Future, a health industry coalition including  drugmakers, insurance companies and private hospitals. The organization opposes Medicare for All and a public option. The study modeled what would happen to rural hospitals if three separate public option approaches were implemented.  While it found that a public option could, depending on the scenario, cause a revenue reduction for rural hospitals of between 2.3% and 14%, the study reached these findings by assuming that the hospitals would be paid at Medicare rates.  Bullock’s campaign website, though, under his rural health care policy proposals, specifically states: ""We need a public option that includes higher reimbursements for rural hospitals."" We asked the Bullock campaign if it could provide us with details about what the ""higher reimbursement"" rate would be based on. It declined. A campaign staffer told us Bullock would support a public option that pays rural hospitals above Medicare rates. Since the reimbursement rates would be higher than Medicare’s, the assumptions in the Navigant study cannot be applied here.  ""If the public option is a reasonably generous payer, that won’t be the end of rural health care,"" said Ippolito. ""But, you can easily imagine due to budgetary concerns, a public payer could have a lower reimbursement, which would have consequences.""  Some health policy experts argue that a public option would help rural hospitals by increasing the number of people in rural areas who have health insurance.  This would ""benefit rural hospitals, since getting virtually nothing from uninsured patients is worse than getting a reasonably good rate from the public option,"" said Gerard Anderson, a professor of health policy and management at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.  Next, we’re on to the NRSC ad’s second claim: ""Medicare as we know it will change, replaced by a government-run program with fewer doctors and longer wait times.""  As several experts pointed out, this sentence doesn’t make a lot of sense. Medicare is already a government-run program.  Also, the design of most public option proposals thus far keeps Medicare and the public option as two separate government programs, said Linda Blumberg, a health policy analyst at the Urban Institute, a think tank.  The NRSC clarified its position and told us it was referring to the idea that a public option would stifle competition in the insurance market, eventually leading to only government-run insurance or Medicare for All. The evidence the NRSC provided to support this claim were quotes from a selection of Republicans, Democrats, professors, and experts from conservative think tanks saying that the public option is a stepping stone to this single-payer approach.  But others suggest that’s a big leap in logic.  ""I think that analysis is almost surely wrong,"" said Matthew Fiedler, a fellow with the Brookings Institution. ""In a world where there is a public option, the negotiating dynamics between insurers and providers would change substantially.""  This would likely create an environment in which private insurers could negotiate lower rates and providers would have to respond to that change in revenue with more efficiencies, he added. However, depending on how a public option plan is structured -- specifically if providers can opt out of participating -- some in-demand providers may choose to stay in private-plan networks where they could negotiate higher payments. This would keep private plans competitive.   ""I don’t think it’s reasonable to argue that a public option would drive all other plans out of the market,"" Fiedler said. Again, Ippolito said it all depends on how the public option program is designed, and he allowed that if providers and hospitals were paid at Medicare rates, the public option would have a huge competitive advantage over commercial insurers because it would be paying out less for services and then could charge lower premiums, and ""there’s no question in the short run, that it would be disruptive.""   As we noted earlier, the prediction of any outcome is difficult without specifics. Without details of Bullock’s public option plan, it’s misleading to characterize the outcome of the public option as surely leading to Medicare for All.  The race between Bullock and Daines is indicative of a trend occurring in campaigns across the country. Republicans often paint Democrats as left of the general public and health care has often been one of the issues the GOP highlights in that effort.  In this case, the NRSC ad links  Bullock to Medicare for All, despite his expressed support for a public option. Sean Manning, Bullock’s campaign spokesperson, said the governor does not support Medicare for All. Jeremy Johnson, an associate professor of political science at Carroll College in Helena, Montana, said that even before COVID-19 became a major campaign issue, Daines, echoing a Trump theme, had pushed the idea that he stood for freedom versus socialism.  ""One of the things [Daines] gives as a symbol of socialism is Medicare for All,"" said Johnson. ""Because Bullock says he favors a public option, there is a conflation of that on the Republican side to mean Medicare for All.""  But the public option and Medicare for All are not the same program and it’s misleading to lump them together.  The NRSC claimed in a television ad that Steve Bullock’s support for the public option would cause rural hospitals to close. While the NRSC did provide us with one study that offered support for its rural hospital claim, the study was industry-funded and based on broad assumptions that don’t accurately reflect positions outlined on Bullock's website. Thus, this claim doesn’t stand up.  The second part of the ad asserts that the public option would lead to the implementation of Medicare for All. While supporters and critics debate how a public option would affect the private health insurance market and some on both sides consider it a ""glide path"" to a single-payer health care system, it’s too big of a jump to say it would definitely trigger this outcome.   We rate this False. ",/factchecks/2020/aug/17/national-republican-senatorial-committee/gop-senate-ad-misrepresents-montana-governors-stan/

Trump tweet mischaracterizes New York’s voting woes
","In numerous public statements, President Donald Trump has questioned the security of voting by mail, and he is using uncounted ballots from New York’s June primary to make his case.  In a July 29 tweet, Trump said: ""New York Mail-In voting is in a disastrous state of condition. Votes from many weeks ago are missing - a total mess. They have no idea what is going on. Rigged Election. I told you so. Same thing would happen, but on massive scale, with USA. Fake News refuses to report!""   New York Mail-In voting is in a disastrous state of condition. Votes from many weeks ago are missing - a total mess. They have no idea what is going on. Rigged Election. I told you so. Same thing would happen, but on massive scale, with USA. Fake News refuses to report!   Terms like ""disastrous state"" and ""total mess"" are subjective and open to interpretation. We recognize that in political rhetoric, there is license for hyperbole. Clearly, there were problems with voting by mail. The delayed results and other issues that emerged from New York’s June 23 primary have been documented by reporters. A month after the primary, some races had not been called. And it stemmed from the expansion of absentee voting as a way to avoid possible exposure to COVID-19 at polling places. But we wondered about Trump’s claim that ""votes from many weeks ago are missing"" and the election was ""rigged.""   The New York State Board of Elections told PolitiFact that there are an unknown number of ballots from eligible voters that cannot be counted and fall into two categories.  ""We have received reports of voters who applied for absentee ballots at the front end, but did not receive them,"" said John Conklin, director of public information at the state board. ""Some of those voters were not entitled to ballots because they were not qualified. This was a primary and some voters were not enrolled in the party having the primary. We have also received reports of voters who returned ballots that did not arrive at the board. The number of ballots in both categories is unknown."" We asked the White House press office about what Trump meant when he said ""missing"" and ""rigged"" but did not receive a response.  We also talked to voting experts and election lawyers about Trump’s claim. Several mentioned the primary in the 12th Congressional District, an election that Trump has also mentioned when talking about problems in New York. Nearly all cautioned that what Trump said in his tweet -- that the election in New York was ""rigged"" -- is unfounded, and that the problems in New York had to do with election workers overwhelmed by vastly more absentee ballots than is typical, as well as strict laws governing absentee ballots. The problems cannot be attributed to ballots cast fraudulently or ballots that were tampered with after they were submitted, they said. ""There’s no rigging of any election here,"" said Sarah Steiner, an election lawyer based in New York City whose clients hold varying positions on the mail-in ballot issue. ""There are people trying to make an election work under the worst possible circumstances,"" she said.  Sarah Goff, deputy director of CommonCause/NY, estimates that 40 to 60 percent of the people who cast ballots in the primary statewide voted with an absentee ballot, a dramatic increase from a typical election.    Norm Ornstein, a political scientist with the American Enterprise Institute who describes himself as a political moderate, said that the situation ""is more an example of ineptitude than it is malfeasance.""  ""The state has a long history of incompetence when it comes to running elections,"" said Ornstein. ""There’s nothing new here.""  Two candidates and a group of voters whose ballots were not counted in New York City filed a lawsuit against the state Board of Elections and won. The lawsuit, citing information from Brooklyn Democratic Chairperson Rodneyse Bichotte, states that almost 4 percent of ballots in Brooklyn alone could be invalidated. Plaintiffs’ lawyers argued in favor of counting ballots that were disqualified because of missing or late postmarks.  The number of ballots that were cast in good faith by eligible voters and were not counted for various reasons -- a missing signature, a missing postmark, or another similar problem, is not known.  We reached out to the conservative Heritage Foundation, which didn’t look at the situation in New York, but said in general, absentee and mail-in ballots are unaccounted for in every election. Hans von Spakovsky, a former member of the Federal Election Commission, cited reports filed with Congress by the U.S. Election Assistance Commission, and said that in the last four federal elections, 1.3 million ballots were rejected by election officials.  PolitiFact found this to be about 1 percent of votes cast.  The state Board of Elections told us that an unknown number of voters who requested ballots did not receive them, and that ballots placed in the mail were not received by the board. These could be considered ""missing,"" the word used by Trump.  But in the same tweet, Trump claims that the election in New York was ""rigged,"" leaving the reader with the impression that these ballots are missing because there was malicious intent, where none has been proven in New York.  We rate Trump’s claim Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2020/aug/15/donald-trump/trump-tweet-mischaracterizes-new-yorks-voting-woes/

In key US Senate race, Susan Collins’ attack on rival over COVID program partly correct
","Susan Collins, viewed as among the most vulnerable U.S. senators up for reelection Nov. 3, says her opponent is guilty of hypocrisy in connection with the federal Payment Protection Program response to COVID-19. The Maine Repubican’s challenger is Democrat Sara Gideon. Gideon’s husband’s law firm ""took up to $2 million"" from the Paycheck Protection Program, a Collins ad claims, the same program she ""falsely"" attacked Collins over. ""That’s hypocrisy,"" the narrator says after making the two-part claim in the ad. It’s similar to a Republican-on-Democrat attack we fact-checked in another key Senate race, in Arizona. In this case, the $2 million part is correct, but the ""falsely attacked"" part is not. Collins has been a senator since 1997. Gideon has served in Maine’s state House since 2013 and as its speaker since 2016. Many news accounts say the race is one that could determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats. With polls showing a tight contest — the Cook Political Report has rated the race a tossup — federal aid programs for businesses have become a focal point of attacks on both sides. Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program to help small businesses affected by the COVID-19 pandemic avoid layoffs. The program was established by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, or CARES Act, signed into law in March by President Donald Trump. The law provides for up to $659 billion in loans for businesses so they can pay their employees and cover certain other expenses, such as rent and utilities. The loans are forgiven if businesses meet specified terms. While the federal government created and administers the program, banks, credit unions and other lending institutions handle the loan applications and disbursement of funds. Collins’ ad launched on Facebook on Aug. 1. According to Facebook, it has been viewed 175,000 to 200,000 times. Wayne Parry, who is identified as a Maine lobsterman in the ad, appears in and narrates the 30-second piece. As has been reported, Parry also served four terms as Republican state representative, backed by campaign donations from a Collins political action committee, and is currently running for his old seat. The ad’s first claim is about a PPP loan of ""up to $2 million"" to the law firm of Gideon’s husband, personal-injury attorney Benjamin Gideon. Berman & Simmons, a Lewiston law firm where Benjamin Gideon is a partner, received a PPP loan of between $1 million and $2 million, according to data from the Small Business Administration. The loan came from a Lewiston bank. The firm did not reply to our request for the exact amount of the loan it received. Gideon campaign spokeswoman Maeve Coyle said Benjamin Gideon is one of 11 partners at the firm and was not involved in seeking the PPP money. She said 43 of the firm’s 61 employees are not attorneys, and that nearly all Maine law firms took PPP loans because the pandemic closed courts. Most large Maine law firms sought PPP aid, the Associated Press reported. Collins’ ad says Gideon’s criticisms have included a false attack on Collins over the program. It cites a June 15 article by the Washington Post Fact Checker that called a Gideon attack ad ""highly misleading."" Still, there are some facts behind Gideon’s attack that are literally accurate, as new reporting from ProPublica shows.  The Gideon ad claimed: ""As coronavirus spread, Susan Collins took $12,000 from the corporate hotel industry. Then Collins wrote a special loophole into her bill allowing large, out-of-state hotels to get millions — while only one in 10 Maine small businesses were getting the help they needed."" We found that Collins collected a total of $12,500 in donations in February from hotel industry political actions. Her campaign committee received $2,500 from the International Franchise Association; $2,500 from Hilton Worldwide; and $2,500 from American Lodging and Hotel. And the American Lodging and Hotel PAC gave $5,000 to Collins’ leadership PAC. As for the timing, by mid-February, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had confirmed 15 coronavirus cases in the United States. Collins and other senators began drafting the PPP bill in early March, said her campaign spokesman, Kevin Kelley. Collins was a key drafter of the PPP, which targeted aid to businesses with 500 or fewer employees. She did respond to lobbying from the hotel industry. As reported Aug. 6 by ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning nonprofit newsroom, Collins’ office said it had been contacted during the drafting process by the International Franchise Association and the American Hotel and Lodging Association, among other business interests, and ultimately an exception was written in the legislation for restaurant and hotel chains. Collins took credit for the exception, which allowed those companies to apply with up to 500 employees per location, even if they were much bigger overall. At least 59 large hotel companies were approved for more than 600 forgivable government loans totaling up to $1 billion despite having more than 500 employees overall, according to ProPublica. In an opinion article she authored, Collins called ProPublica ""a left-wing outlet that is financed by Democratic billionaires."" She defended the exception, saying it made a franchise hotel owner eligible ""as intended to help keep the business afloat and its workers employed,"" but that a large corporate chain such as Hilton ""is prohibited from receiving a PPP loan for its corporate headquarters or any hotels that it owns and operates directly."" On Gideon’s claim that at the time, only one in 10 small businesses in Maine got the forgivable PPP loans, the Bangor Daily News reported that statistic as of mid-April, saying 16,000 Maine small businesses had received aid. That was at a point when the first batch of PPP funds had been exhausted. Federal figures show that as of Aug. 8, more than 28,000 PPP loans were made in Maine. So, Gideon’s number was from initial reports that later increased.  Overall, we found Gideon’s attack on Collins to be a mixture of exaggeration and accuracy.  Collins claimed that Gideon’s husband’s law firm ""took up to $2 million"" from the same federal program she ""falsely"" attacked Susan Collins over. The law firm where Gideon’s husband is a partner did take a loan through the federal Payment Protection Program program that could be as large as $2 million. With fewer than 500 employees, the firm qualifies as a small business under the program’s guidelines. But Gideon’s attack on Collins is largely accurate.  As Gideon claimed in an ad, after Collins received campaign contributions from the hotel industry, she wrote an exception in the PPP law that, according to a ProPublica investigation, enabled at least 59 large hotel companies to be approved for more than 600 forgivable government loans totaling up to $1 billion.

Pritzker’s mostly correct about Illinois’ historic unemployment spike
","Overwhelmed by a surge in unemployment claims during the COVID-19 recession, the Illinois Department of Employment Security has faced criticism for lengthy backlogs, a data breach and user fraud. During an Aug. 4 news conference, Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker defended his agency’s response given the tsunami of new claims flooding in. ""IDES, as you know, was hit with something no one expected: 10 to 20 times the claims, even during the worst recession of my lifetime. That was the 2008-2009 recession,"" Pritzker said. ""No one expected that we could see a recession worse than that one."" Nationwide, initial unemployment claims last week dipped below 1 million for the first time since March, but the figures remain staggeringly high. Even so, we wondered if the number of claims filed in the early weeks of the pandemic in Illinois really reached the levels Pritzker suggested. So we reached out to the governor’s office to ask for the data. Spokeswoman Jordan Abudayyeh sent us IDES figures for initial unemployment claims for each week of the current recession, which officially began in February. She highlighted two separate weeks when the number of claims reached a peak, and sent data for the corresponding weeks of the Great Recession which started in December 2007. In week nine of the current recession, the week ending April 4, 2020, IDES received more than 202,000 new unemployment claims — 12.5 times more than the roughly 16,000 the agency received for week nine of the 2008 recession. And in week 15 of the current recession, the week ending May 16, 2020, initial claims spiked again as jobless workers in the gig economy and others who were previously ineligible for unemployment insurance began to apply under the new federal Pandemic Unemployment Assistance program. That week, IDES received a little over 10 times the number of new claims it got in week 15 of the previous recession. Both peak weeks fall within the range Pritzker cited even though they don’t reach as high as 20 times more, or even 15 times more. Tallies for other weeks this year outpaced the comparable period of the Great Recession but by less than 10 fold. Experts told us it was fair for Pritzker to highlight those early spikes given the unique challenges state unemployment systems faced in processing claims because of the sudden health crisis sweeping the nation. ""It was all of a sudden, just everybody at once,"" said Eliza Forsythe, an assistant professor at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign’s School of Labor & Employment Relations. ""Because it was so fast, these claims were many times over what we usually see, even in other recessions."" Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at the University of Michigan, said although there are multiple ways to compare this recession, ""they all point to a surge in initial unemployment claims of historic proportions."" Pritzker’s spokeswoman also told us the governor’s claim referred to the difference between the claims IDES is seeing this year and the numbers it normally receives. Pritzker did not make this clear in his original remarks. ""The governor is saying IDES is seeing 10-20x the claims they normally do as well as EVEN more than the worst recession,"" Abudayyeh wrote in an email. IDES data backs that up. New claims this year outpaced those received in Illinois last year by 10 or more times in 10 of the last 20 weeks. In three of those weeks, cases were between 20 and 23 times greater than the same period in 2019. Pritzker said when COVID-19 struck, IDES ""was hit with something no one expected: 10 to 20 times the claims, even during the worst recession of my lifetime."" His office pointed to two weeks when state data show new unemployment claims surged by as much as 12 times the number of initial claims received in the same weeks during the 2008 recession. Those two weeks of peak claims fall within the range Pritzker cited, if not hitting 20. His spokeswoman also told us the governor was referring to the difference between the claims IDES is seeing this year and the numbers it normally receives, which is supported by the data too.

No, Kamala Harris didn’t say she wants to eliminate beef
","Hundreds of Facebook users have shared a post that says that Kamala Harris, presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden’s running mate, wants to put an end to beef production.

Cory Booker of New Jersey to go after animal agriculture.  ""Kamala Harris wants to eliminate this right here. If you raise beef or eat beef, you can't vote (for) the Democratic Party this election. She has worked with Cory Booker on eliminating animal agriculture and is on record starting that meat is killing the planet. That shows her ignorance,"" the post says. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Despite what this post alleges, Harris hasn’t said she wants to eliminate beef.  In July, Booker, who is a vegan, introduced legislation to protect workers at meatpacking plants, which became deadly hot spots amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The bill would suspend waivers and rules that permit companies to ramp up production, and Harris was one of its cosponsors. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated in July that 16,233 COVID-19 cases in 239 meat and poultry processing facilities were reported in 23 states across the country.  It’s not just Facebook users who are weighing in on Harris’ policy recommendations for meat consumption and production. President Donald Trump’s YouTube account recently shared a video clip from Harris at a CNN climate change town hall during the Democratic primaries in September 2019. At an August 2020 speech in Iowa, Vice President Mike Pence criticized her town hall remarks and said, ""We’re not going to let Joe Biden and Kamala Harris cut America’s meat."" But Pence’s statements were misleading. Here’s what Harris said at the town hall. ""As a nation, we actually have to have a real priority at the highest level of government around what we eat and in terms of healthy eating,"" Harris said in response to a question at the CNN town hall. The agriculture sector contributed 10% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions in 2018, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. Cattle produce methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as part of their digestive process, and the management of manure can also add to emissions.  Harris added that the government should create incentives and change dietary guidelines to reduce the consumption of red meat, as opposed to banning it altogether.  ""I love cheeseburgers from time to time,"" Harris said. A viral Facebook post says that Kamala Harris wants to eliminate beef. Harris didn’t say that.

Fact-checking an attack on Sen. Susan Collins over opioids, campaign donations
","The opioid addiction crisis, along with the billions earned by the maker of OxyContin, are being invoked in a race that could help determine whether Republicans keep control of the U.S. Senate. The target is four-term GOP incumbent Susan Collins of Maine. The attack comes from Senate Majority PAC, which works to elect Democrats to the Senate. Collins ""voted against accountability for opioid makers"" and ""lied"" when she said she didn’t take campaign money from a family who made its wealth selling OxyContin, the political action committee claims in a TV ad. The claim misleadingly cherry-picks one Collins vote.  But while being videotaped in 2020, Collins did deny taking any campaign funds from the family, when she did receive one donation in 2007. Collins has served in the Senate since 1997. Her opponent Sara Gideon has served in the Maine’s House since 2013 and as its speaker since 2016. With polls showing a tight contest, the Cook Political Report has rated the race a tossup. Many news accounts say the race is one that could determine whether Republicans keep a majority in the Senate, where they now control 53 seats. Purdue Pharma began selling OxyContin, a slow-release pill based on the pain reliever oxycodone, in the mid-1990s and heavily promoted it. Between 1991 and 2011, the number of opioid prescriptions, as well as the number of opioid-related deaths, nearly tripled. Since 2000, four opioids — oxycodone, hydrocodone, heroin and fentanyl, a synthetic — have killed more than 400,000 Americans. That includes nearly 15,000 people who suffered fatal overdoses from prescription opioids in 2018, the latest year for those figures from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Purdue Pharma is seeking bankruptcy protection as part of an effort to settle nearly 3,000 lawsuits brought against it by state, local and tribal governments that blame the company for sparking the opioid crisis. The company's settlement plan calls for the members of the Sackler family who own the company to pay at least $3 billion and give up ownership of Purdue. The PAC’s 30-second ad starts by citing a figure for the number of opioid pills ""pushed to Maine"" by opioid distributors and how much money opioid distributors have given to Collins’ campaign. Then it says Collins accepted campaign money from Jonathan Sackler (who died of cancer on June 30.) Senate Majority PAC cited a donation of $2,300 that Sackler made to Collins’ campaign in 2007. Then comes the two parts of the ad we’re checking. Claim No. 1. Collins ""voted against accountability for opioid makers."" The reference is to Collins’ vote in a Senate committee against a failed amendment, proposed by Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., to the Opioid Crisis Response Act of 2018.  Sanders said his amendment would have imposed retroactive fines on companies and executives and set new punishments for future activities.  Collins campaign spokesman Kevin Kelley, noting that three Democrats on the committee also voted no, told PolitiFact that Collins’ concern was the amendment ""was written so broadly that anyone involved in a transaction could have been implicated.""  Kelley cited instances in which Collins voted to hold opioid companies accountable, including voting for a 2018 law. One provision in that law aims to hold drug distributors and manufacturers accountable for stopping delivery of drugs on suspiciously high orders by pharmacies and stopping the diversion of drugs. A 2016 law she voted for requires any new drug application for an opioid to be referred to an advisory committee for recommendations prior to FDA approval. Claim No. 2. Collins ""lied"" about campaign money This part of the ad features a video clip, recorded in January, showing Collins on an airplane having a conversation with a woman who is not visible: Woman: ""Your campaign has taken money from the Sacklers?""  Collins: ""From the Sacklers? No, I have not."" Woman: ""Never?"" Collins: ""Never."" Collins did not know she was being videotaped and was thinking about donations for the current campaign when she answered the question, Kelley said. ""But, to be more accurate, the senator has said that she should have said that she does not recall receiving such a donation,"" he said. The woman in the conversation is Amy Halsted, co-director of the Maine People’s Alliance, according to a January article by MaineBeacon.com, which is a project of the alliance. The alliance is a progressive grassroots group. The article includes video of the full six-minute conversation. An attack ad claimed Collins ""voted against accountability for opioid makers"" and ""lied"" when she said she didn’t take campaign money from a family who made its wealth selling OxyContin. The first part of the claim is misleading. On holding manufacturers accountable, Collins voted against one measure that failed, but voted for several others that became law.  When asked if she had ever taken campaign money from the Sackler family, Collins said no, and was wrong. One member of the family gave her one donation, of $2,300, in 2007. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

No, Kamala Harris wasn’t the prosecutor in the ‘Fruitvale Station’ case

The photo from the movie shows Jordan sitting down with his hands raised. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  It’s wrong.  Here’s some pertinent history, which the San Francisco Chronicle recounts in this story looking back on Grant’s death 10 years after the shooting:  Johannes Mehserle, a police officer with Bay Area Rapid Transit, shot Grant, who was unarmed, in the back after Grant among others were pulled off a train after a fight. Mehserle resigned from BART on Jan. 7, 2009, less than a week after the shooting. Hours after his resignation, protesters marched and rioters smashed storefronts in downtown Oakland while demanding the district attorney in Alameda County, where Oakland is the county seat, file a murder charge against Mehserle. The district attorney at the time was Tom Orloff, not Kamala Harris.  Two weeks after the shooting, Orloff charged Mehserle with murder. His trial began in June 2010. David Stein was the prosecutor for the district attorney’s office who tried the case.  On July 8 of that year, the jury convicted Mehserle of involuntary manslaughter, suggesting that jurors believed Mehserle’s defense that he intended to tase Grant, not shoot him. They also convicted him of ""intentionally"" firing a gun, though a judge later threw that conviction out. Mehserle was sentenced to a minimum of two years in custody but with credit for time served, he was eligible for release about seven months later. Harris isn’t named in the Chronicle’s story, which ran less than a month before she declared her candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination. As a high-profile U.S. senator, her connection to the case would draw attention in an article on the 10-year anniversary of Grant’s death.  According to a biography of Harris on California’s justice department website, she joined the Alameda County DA’s office in 1990 after graduating from law school. She worked there until 1998, prosecuting child sexual assault, homicide and robbery cases, before leaving to work in the San Francisco district attorney’s office.  In 2004, she started her tenure as the first woman district attorney in San Francisco, according to the bio, a post she held until 2010.

No, Joe Biden can't ban school choice vouchers in Wisconsin
","Should tax dollars be used to fund private school tuition? In Wisconsin, this is done through a system commonly referred to as vouchers or school choice, where parents apply money the state would have given a public school for their child toward tuition at approved private schools. Supporters say parents are providing the education funds through tax dollars, so it’s only fair for the funding to follow their child to another school. Critics say it’s not right to use public funds to support what are in many cases religious institutions, and that vouchers bleed needed support from public schools. The system is one of many dividing lines in the 2020 presidential race between President Donald Trump and former Vice President Joe Biden. One website ""analysis"" shared widely on Facebook claimed Biden’s stance would have sweeping consequences in Wisconsin. The Aug. 11, 2020, article from Milwaukee City Wire used this headline: ""Analysis: Biden school choice ban would impact 74,000 Wisconsin students, 35,000 in Milwaukee."" This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook). Let’s separate fact from fiction. The article was published by one of many purported local news sites run by Metric Media Publications. The company boasts 24 web pages with a Wisconsin brand under names like ""Central Wisconsin News,"" ""Green Bay Reporter"" and ""The Sconi."" It also includes the ""Fon du Lac News,"" where the city name of Fond du Lac is misspelled in both the web address and the banner atop each page. The Metric Media Foundation, the official name of the nonprofit entity, says on its website it runs more than 1,000 such websites around the country. The Columbia Journalism Review reported the network relies heavily on algorithmically-generated stories and can be traced to conservative businessman Brian Timpone. His former company, Journatic, drew outrage in 2012 for plagiarism, fake bylines and fake quotes in what was dubbed ""pink slime journalism."" For this particular story what is labeled an ""analysis"" is actually just a regurgitation of a Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction spreadsheet, which the story’s unnamed author misunderstood. Now, on to the claim. The fundamental assertion here is that Biden wants to ban school choice. That’s not a new claim. And it’s not exactly accurate. PolitiFact National rated Mostly False a Trump claim that Biden ""wants to end school choice.""  The key question is what ""school choice"" means. EdChoice, an advocacy group that says it aims ""to advance educational freedom and choice,"" says that term can include private school vouchers as well as charter schools and specialized ""magnet"" schools that, for instance, may focus on math and science or the arts. In Wisconsin, the term school choice is often used as shorthand for the three voucher programs (Milwaukee, Racine and statewide), but it could also refer to an array of non-traditional schooling options such as charter schools, virtual schools and the open enrollment program, where a student can enroll in a public school outside his or her district. RELATED: No, voucher schools haven't raised property taxes by $1B since 2011 Biden’s campaign, which did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this piece, told PolitiFact National that Biden ""does not oppose districts letting parents choose to send their children to public magnet schools, high-performing public charters or traditional public schools."" But Biden is against sending public money to private K-12 schools through voucher programs, something supported by Trump and his Education Secretary Betsy DeVos.  Regardless of Biden’s preference, however, he wouldn’t have the power as president to simply halt voucher programs — in Wisconsin or anywhere else. ""Parental choice programs in Wisconsin are state authorized and funded,"" said state DPI spokesman Chris Bucher. ""They are not subject to federal control."" Jim Bender, president of School Choice Wisconsin, agreed, noting Biden would have ""very limited power to impact school choice,"" just as Trump and DeVos now ""are pretty limited"" in their ability to pursue their desired expansion of school choice. Frederick Hess, director of education policy studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said it is possible Biden could create hurdles for school vouchers, though — particularly if Congress swings to the Democratic Party in November. ""Certainly on the face of it, (a ban) does not seem to be an immediately credible threat,"" Hess said. ""But one can spin scenarios if one works hard enough."" Since about 10% of school spending comes from Washington (primarily for special education and low-income students), a Democratic Congress could write legislation or dole out that aid in a way that hinders voucher funding, Hess said. Or the Department of Justice could mount lawsuits that would impede vouchers. The DOJ involvement isn’t exactly far-fetched given the agency (unsuccessfully) sued the Louisiana school choice program in 2013 under President Barack Obama, asserting the program ""frustrates and impedes the desegregation process.""  But these hypotheticals are a far cry from the suggestion in this story that Biden can implement a ban. The legitimacy of voucher programs has been upheld at the highest levels, including a June 2020 decision where the U.S. Supreme Court ruled, 5-4, that Montana’s voucher program should not be struck down for redirecting tax dollars to a religious entity. That overturned a Montana Supreme Court ruling that ended the voucher program. All of which brings us to the last part of the claim: That a ban would impact 74,000 Wisconsin students. The text of the article referred to these as the tallies for the 2018-19 school year.  But the stats are badly botched on multiple fronts. The number comes from a DPI report summarizing the voucher program, but it’s from 2019-20, not the preceding year. And the actual number of students in the voucher program was 42,157. The number cited in the headline is the total number of students attending voucher schools — many of whom paid their own way and did not use taxpayer-funded vouchers. A viral post on Facebook from a pseudo-news site says a ""Biden school choice ban would impact 74,000 Wisconsin students."" Biden does oppose one stripe of school choice programs, ones that apply public tax dollars to parents’ private school tuition bills. But everything else in this headline is wrong. The term ""school choice"" also covers an array of other programs that Biden supports. And the voucher program in Wisconsin is about 42,000 students, not 74,000. But most notably, the assertion that Biden has the power to ""ban"" such voucher programs simply doesn’t hold water. A president and Congress that opposed vouchers could put some hurdles in place, but the Wisconsin program is authorized and funded by the state.

Are Republican voters in Texas 20 years older than Democrats, on average?
","Texas Democrats fought to expand access to mail-in ballots in the state to all voters during the primary runoff election, citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic in multiple lawsuits filed in state and federal courts. Their efforts were blocked, meaning the normal rules for voting by mail were in place for the July election and extra safety precautions were in place at polling sites, including finger coverings for using the voting machines and social distancing for those waiting to vote. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, a Republican, fought the effort to expand mail-in voting through the courts, where cases are still pending that could impact voting during the November election. During an interview with Progress Texas, a liberal advocacy group, state Rep. Gene Wu, D-Houston, said Republicans should support the expansion of mail-in voting because of the demographics of the party’s supporters. ""In Texas, vote-by-mail overwhelmingly benefits Republicans,"" Wu said. ""The average age of the Republican voter is like 20 years older than the average Democrat. It is a lot. Their average age is like 65, or something crazy high like that."" In Texas, state law allows people who meet certain criteria to apply to vote through the mail, which includes any person over 65 years old. So, is Wu’s comparison accurate? Is the average Republican voter in Texas really 20 years older than the average Democratic voter? Wu said he was aware of reporting to this effect, but did not have a source for the specific statistic he shared during the interview. Looking to the voter rolls In Texas, voters do not register with political parties and they are not required to have any affiliation with a party to participate in that group’s primary election. To check Wu’s statement about the average age of voters in each party, we turned to voter registration data available from the Texas Secretary of State’s office and different polls of likely voters in the state. Derek Ryan, a voter data specialist and  the former research director for the Republican Party of Texas, maintains a list of registered voters and, at PolitiFact Texas’ request, analyzed the ages of people who voted during this year’s Republican primary and Democratic primary. ""Based on this data, the average age of people who voted in the 2020 Republican primary election was 59.2 years old,"" he said. ""The average age of people who voted in the 2020 Democratic primary election was 51.6 years old."" In 2018, Ryan found that people who voted in the Republican primary averaged 60.1 years of age and Democratic primary voters had an average age of 54.5. Based on those figures, the average Republican voter was about 7.6 years older than the average Democratic voter in 2020 and about 5.6 years older in 2018. Ryan did note that, while primary election data is the best way to identify Republican and Democratic voters, people who go to the polls in primaries tend to be older across the board compared with people who vote in general elections. ""But the Democrats appear to be doing a better job at getting younger voters to participate in their primary (Beto in 2018 and a competitive presidential primary in 2020 probably helped),"" he said in an email. ""I went back to the 2012 election cycle and the average age of a Democratic primary voter that year was 57 while the average age of a Republican primary voter was 59."" Brandon Rottinghaus, a political science professor at the University of Houston, conducted an analysis using polling data on political ideologies in the state. Both surveys he cited are representative of the state’s general population and do not reflect just those individuals who actually voted, the population Wu specified in his statement. Using Harvard University’s Cooperative Congressional Election Study, a national survey with state-level data, Rottinghaus said the average age of people who identified as Republicans in Texas in 2018 was 52 and the average age of people who said they were Democrats was 46 — a 6-year age difference. In 2016, the average age of Republicans was 54 and the average Democrat was 49. That’s a gap of 5 years. Polling from Univision in partnership with the University of Houston showed a similar trend — although people were asked to identify their ideology, not a political party. In 2018, Rottinghaus said respondents who said they were conservative or very conservative had an average age of 57, while those who said they were liberal or very liberal had an average age of 41 — 16-year age gap. In 2016, conservative or very conservative respondents had an average age of 57, and liberal or very liberal respondents had an average age of 47 — a 10 year difference. Our ruling Wu said that in Texas, the ""average age of the Republican voter is like 20 years older than the average Democrat."" The most recent voter data shows that the average Republican voter was older than the average Democrat, but the age difference was far less pronounced than Wu’s statement, for which he did not have supporting evidence. The average Republican voter in Texas was younger than Wu said and the average Democrat was older.

Kamala Harris is open to letting Boston bomber vote, but didn’t advocate for it
","Joe Biden’s choice of Kamala Harris as his vice presidential running mate drew an attack the same day from Republican Nancy Mace, who is running for a congressional seat in South Carolina. Mace’s Aug. 11 tweet made a half dozen claims about Harris, a Democratic senator from California. One referred to the surviving bomber in the 2013 bombing at the Boston Marathon, who killed three people and wounded more than 260 others.   Harris ""advocated for restoring voting rights for the Boston bomber,"" Mace claimed. During her own campaign for the presidential nomination, she said she is open to the idea, but she didn’t advocate for it. Mace, a state representative since 2018, describes herself as a single mom, businesswoman and former Waffle House waitress. The first woman to graduate from The Citadel military college in South Carolina, she is challenging first-term Democratic Rep. Joe Cunningham in the Nov. 3 election.  As of Aug. 7, the Cook Political Report rated the race a tossup.  On July 31, a federal appeals court threw out the death penalty for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who had been convicted for his role in the marathon bombing, leaving in place a life sentence. His lawyers argued that the mastermind of the attack was his older brother, Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was killed in a gunfight with police a few days after the April 15, 2013 bombing.  Harris worked as a prosecutor in Alameda County (Oakland) and in San Francisco, then was elected San Francisco district attorney in 2003 and 2007. In 2010, she was elected California attorney general, then was re-elected in 2014. A series of CNN town halls on April 22, 2019, with candidates running for the Democratic presidential nomination for president included sessions with U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Harris.  Sanders said that he believes all prisoners — including ""terrible people"" like the Boston Marathon bomber — should be allowed to vote.  That prompted an exchange between Harris and host Don Lemon, who asked Harris what she thought of the idea. Harris: ""I agree that the right to vote is one of the very important components of citizenship and it is something that people should not be stripped of needlessly, which is why I have been long an advocate of making sure that the formerly incarcerated are not denied a right to vote, which is the case in so many states in our country, in some states permanently deprived of the right to vote.  ""And these are policies that go back to Jim Crow. These are policies that go back to the heart of policies that have been about disenfranchisement, policies that continue until today, and we need to take it seriously."" Lemon: ""But people who are convicted, in prison, like the Boston Marathon bomber, on death row, people who are convicted of sexual assault — they should be able to vote?""  Harris: ""I think we should have that conversation.""  On the campaign trail the next day, a reporter asked Harris to expand on her remarks about the Boston bomber, saying: ""What is your view on felons voting from prison?"" In comments that her then-press secretary highlighted on Twitter, Harris replied by saying she would make a decision after giving the issue more thought:  ""Listen, it’s a complex issue, and I take it very seriously. Look, I’m running for president of the United States; I'm going to be very thoughtful and serious about the issues I weigh in on. And so I'm going to think about it, and I'm going to talk to experts, and I'm going to make a decision, and I'll let you know. I will tell you this: One, it's a complex issue, I'm fully aware of that. Two, we right now have got a lot of work to do with the people in our country who have served their time and have been prohibited from voting. ""Currently in our country there are 6 million people who have served their time and are still prohibited from voting, and that has been an area of focus for me for quite some time, and we have got to address that immediately. And so that is one of my first areas of focusing concern. ""But, do I think people who commit murder, or people who are terrorists, should be deprived of their rights? Yeah, I do. I'm a prosecutor, I believe there have to be serious consequences for the most extreme types of crimes."" Mace claimed that Harris ""advocated for restoring voting rights for the Boston bomber."" Harris has not said that she would advocate for giving the surviving Boston marathon bomber the right to vote, only that she is open to a conversation about it.

Barnes misses with claim linking cut in polling places with 'racist disenfranchisement'
","The political mudslinging surrounding who is responsible for Wisconsin’s chaotic spring election is not quite over.  In an Aug. 10, 2020, op-ed in The Progressive, Lt. Gov. Mandela Barnes a Democrat, blamed the Republican-led state Legislature for exacerbating racial inequalities in the state and described efforts to disenfranchise Black voters — ""from gerrymandering our districts to making the simple task of voting unnecessarily arduous."" He then said: ""We have one of the most restrictive voter ID laws in the country, and we saw a new kind of racist disenfranchisement play out during our catastrophic April 7 election, when there were only five polling places in Milwaukee, instead of the usual 180."" Was GOP-backed ""racist disenfranchisement"" behind the decision to have only five polling places open in Milwaukee during the spring election? Let’s take a look. Barnes isn’t the first person to point fingers in the wake of the tumultuous spring election. The Republican Party of Wisconsin in early July accused Democrats of closing down voting locations in some of Wisconsin's largest cities — including Milwaukee — during the election ""to cause chaos."" We rated that claim False, noting the decision to consolidate polling places largely came down to poll worker shortages. There also wasn’t evidence to suggest Democrats would benefit from the chaos or from discouraging votes.  The Democratic Party of Wisconsin later claimed Republicans pushed for longer lines and limited voting time amid the pandemic.  We rated that claim Mostly False, noting the statement ignored GOP calls for early voting. Republicans did push for in-person voting during the election, but it was a stretch to say they ""pushed"" for long polling lines. What’s more, the number of open polling places was a local decision. When asked to back up the claim, Chet Agni, a spokesperson for Barnes’ campaign, said Barnes’ claim was not that racist disenfranchisement caused only five polling places to be open but rather that disenfranchisement was ""an effect of only five polling places being open."" But that’s not the way it was presented. In the opinion piece, the claim included a litany of criticisms of actions by the Republican-controlled Legislature, such as gerrymandering and voter ID laws and then immediately called the limited polling places ""a new kind of racist disenfranchisement."" So, let’s start with some of the basics on the election. In his opinion piece, Barnes included a link to an April 9, 2020 Milwaukee Journal Sentinel article that examined the reason for the limited number of polling sites in Milwaukee. In it, Neil Albrecht, then-executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, attributed the small number of polling locations in the city to a shortage of poll workers who expressed concerns about safety at the polls. In the end, Gov. Tony Evers allowed National Guard troops to assist at the polls, but Milwaukee officials said that decision came too late for them to adjust and open more locations.   Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, told PolitiFact Wisconsin voting policies in Wisconsin over the past decade — when Republicans have generally controlled state government — have had ""a disproportionate impact on communities of color, as well as other vulnerable voting groups."" But Mayer added he does ""not see evidence that the (election officials) had the goal of disenfranchising Black voters"" when reducing the number of Milwaukee polling places from 180 to five.  He said the consolidation of polling places made it more difficult for all voters in Milwaukee to get to the polls and noted polling place movement and consolidation is ""frequently a strategy used to make voting more difficult for minority voters."" The issue, though, is a complex one. GOP lawmakers fought efforts to delay the April election and took a move by Evers to do so to the state Supreme Court, which ruled the election must be held as planned. And Republicans fought an effort to extend the deadline to return a mailed-in absentee ballot beyond the day of the election. A U.S. Supreme Court ruling the day before the election held that no ballots postmarked after election day should be counted.  Yet, the number of polling sites were reduced throughout the city -- not just in neighborhoods with more Black voters. And reducing the number of polling places was a local decision by Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett, a Democrat, and city election officials — not by Republicans.  In the end, all of that undermines the idea that racial disenfranchisement was the purpose of the dramatically reduced number of polling places.  But what about Barnes’ contention that racial disenfranchisement was the result? His aide, Agni, pointed to a June 24, 2020 study from the Brennan Center for Justice, a left-leaning public policy institute, that found the consolidation of polling places in Milwaukee during the April election reduced turnout among Black voters by 10.2% compared to past elections. Turnout among non-Black voters decreased by around 8.5% due to the consolidation, according to the study.  Agni also cited an analysis of election data from researchers at two advocacy groups, All Voting Is Local and Demos, that found average voter turnout in Black and Hispanic wards was 30 percentage points lower than the average voter turnout in white wards. We did our own analysis of Spring election data for Milwaukee and found more than 53 percent fewer ballots were cast in majority-Black wards in 2020 than 2016. Roughly 37 percent fewer ballots were cast in majority-white wards in 2020 than in 2016.  It was difficult to determine how many of these were cast absentee, and — as such — would not be determined by the number of in-person polling locations.  Meanwhile, there may be other factors at play as well, such as the fact the 2016 primary included competitive contests on the Republican and Democratic sides, while that was not the case in 2020. Barnes claimed that GOP-backed ""racist disenfrachisement"" led to only five polling places being open in Milwaukee for April 7 election. While closing polling places did appear to have a disproportionate impact on Black voters, the context of the claim suggests the goal of closing polling places was racial disenfranchisement. While Republican maneuvering contributed to the chaos and uncertainty around the election, decisions on polling places were made in Milwaukee, not Madison.  We rate this claim Mostly False.
