In defending U.S. currency, Bachmann distorts Geithner's comments about dollar
","
Rep. Michele Bachmann has been uncommonly strident lately in her opposition to the Democrats running Congress and the Obama administration.
 
Bachmann, a Minnesota Republican who is a tax lawyer, considers herself a ""foreign correspondent on enemy lines"" in Washington, D.C. She also called for an ""orderly revolution"" against the Democrats on a recent radio show.
 
One source of her concern, Bachmann has said repeatedly, is that she fears the Obama administration wants to do away with the dollar. She introduced a constitutional amendment on March 25 that would prohibit that. Thirty-one Republicans have co-sponsored it.
 
In a news release announcing the measure, Bachmann claimed Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner had said he was open to the idea of dropping the dollar.
 
""Yesterday, during a Financial Services Committee hearing, I asked Secretary Geithner if he would denounce efforts to move towards a global currency and he answered unequivocally that he would,"" Bachmann said in the March 25, 2009

news release

. ""And President Obama gave the nation the same assurances. But just a day later, Secretary Geithner has left the option on the table. I want to know which it is.""
 
Bachmann's allegation that Geithner ""left the option on the table"" is based on comments he made at a question-and-answer session that day at the Council on Foreign Relations.
 

Here's

the relevant exchange:
 
""Wonder if you could comment on two related things,"" a questioner said to Geithner. ""One, the Chinese government proposal about a global currency; and about the IMF regulations...""
 
""On the first question, I haven't read the (Chinese central bank) governor's proposal,"" Geithner said. ""He's a remarkably — a very thoughtful, very careful, distinguished central banker. Generally find him sensible on every issue.""
 
It might have sounded to those who don't follow finance that Geithner declined to dismiss the idea of replacing the dollar with a multinational currency.
 
But those who do follow finance would know the Chinese proposal had nothing to do with replacing the U.S. currency. Rather, it was to replace the dollar as the international reserve currency.
 
An

Associated Press Q-and-A

about the Chinese proposal published a day before Bachmann's news release explained the difference: ""Q: Does China want to get rid of the dollar and other currencies?"" it says. ""A: No, Americans wouldn't be expected to give up the dollar, nor would China give up its yuan, for that matter. The idea is to create an international currency that China and other countries could use to hold trillions of dollars in reserves.""
 
Chinese officials have argued that creating a new global currency for international reserves would protect them from the danger of inflation of the dollar, which would lower the value of their reserves.
 
In any event, for Geithner to entertain the Chinese idea (which he later firmly rejected) was decidedly not to consider pulling the greenback off the street in favor of some one-world currency.
 
Yet that is clearly how Bachmann portrayed Geithner's remarks.
 
Bachmann's spokeswoman, Debee Keller, said, ""We all recognize the difference between the global reserve currency and the actual currency we use here in the U.S."" She said Bachmann was trying to defend the dollar's status in both regards.
 
But in her news release and in public comments, Bachmann continually distorted the issue, suggesting that Geithner expressed openness to replacing the dollar as the U.S. currency. For example, her news release was titled: ""Bachmann Demands Truth: Will Obama Administration Abandon Dollar for a Multi-National Currency?"" It said her resolution would ""bar the dollar from being replaced by any foreign currency.""
 
And her proposed constitutional amendment makes no mention of an international reserve currency — rather it would forbid the president from ""entering into a treaty or other international agreement that would provide for the United States to adopt as legal tender in the United States a currency issued by an entity other than the United States.""
 
Bachmann continued to confuse the issue the next day on

Hannity's America: 

""I'm very concerned about the international moves they're making,"" she said, referring to the Obama administration. ""Particularly the question that there was about moving the United States off of the dollar and onto a global currency, like Russia and China are calling for.""
 
Again, Russia and China were not calling for ""moving the United States off the dollar.""
 
A few days later, on the

Glenn Beck Program,

Bachmann made comments that indicated more understanding of the subtlety of the issue. Instead of railing against replacing the dollar, she referred to the prospect of the International Monetary Fund ""taking the dollar off as the medium of exchange.""
 
But never during that appearance did she correct Beck's introduction, in which he had said Geithner ""can't make up his mind whether or not he supports the global currency to replace the U.S. dollar or leave the U.S. dollar. The next guest (Bachmann) adamantly opposes a global currency and is proposing legislation now that would prohibit the United States from recognizing any other currency besides the greenback.""
 
So Bachmann left Beck's viewers with the impression that Geithner was open to abandoning the dollar.
 
This claim, which Bachmann repeated in several forums over several days, including in a news release that remains on her Web site, is just wrong. That earns a False on the Truth-O-Meter.

Conditions in Afghanistan have deteriorated for soldiers and civilians alike
","
Long since eclipsed by Iraq, the Afghan conflict, known to the military as Operation Enduring Freedom, has often been relegated to the back pages of the newspaper.
 
Even as it has faded from view, however, the war has grown ever deadlier, President Barack Obama said in a speech to government officials and military officers at the White House on March 27, 2009.
 
""It's been more than seven years since the Taliban was removed from power, yet war rages on, and insurgents control parts of Afghanistan and Pakistan,"" Obama said, announcing the deployment of 17,000 more troops to Afghanistan. ""Attacks against our troops, our NATO allies, and the Afghan government have risen steadily. And most painfully, 2008 was the deadliest year of the war for American forces.""
 
We wondered if that was true and checked the latest

Pentagon statistics

. Indeed, U.S. military deaths numbered 155 in 2008, which is the highest since the war began in 2001.
 
The number of U.S. deaths has increased almost every year, with two exceptions. The year-to-year fatality count, from 2001 to 2008, is: 11, 48, 45, 52, 98, 98, 117, 155.
 
In the first two months of 2009, there were 30 U.S. military deaths, putting this year on pace to be the deadliest yet.
 
We looked for any indication that this statistic was unrepresentative of the conditions in Afghanistan. Quite the contrary — it is one of several measures by which the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated.
 
The number of U.S. military personnel wounded in action has also increased every year, from 33 in 2001 to 790 in 2008, totaling 2,713.
 
Military deaths of personnel from the 21 other outside countries involved in the conflict have increased every year since 2004, to a peak so far of 139 in 2008 (and 2009 is on pace to surpass that).
 
Afghan civilian casualties hit a high mark too last year, with 2,118 civilians killed, up from 1,523 in 2007, according to the United Nations.
 
In testimony to the House Armed Services Committee in September, Adm. Mike Mullen, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Taliban and al-Qaida fighters are coordinating better from safe havens in Pakistan and launching ""ever more sophisticated, even infantry-like attacks against fixed coalition positions.""
 
""I'm not convinced we're winning it in Afghanistan,"" Mullen said.
 
Defense Secretary Robert Gates told the committee Afghanistan was in some ways a more complex challenge than Iraq. ""We don't have a single adversary,"" he said. ""We have the Taliban, we have the Gulbuddin Hekmatyar group, we have the Haqqani network, we have narco-thugs, we have al-Qaida, we have foreign fighters.""
 
So Obama's claim is not only technically correct, but also accurately reflects the deteriorating security conditions in Afghanistan. We find his claim to be True.

Judd Gregg is against reconcilation now, but has been for it in past
","
When Democratic leaders said they wouldn't rule out a procedure called budget reconciliation to pass sweeping measures on health care reform and carbon emissions policy, Republican senators immediately objected.
 
Little known outside Washington, budget reconciliation is a policy created in 1974 that essentially allows the Senate to pass legislation on revenue and spending levels with a simple majority — 51 votes rather than the 60 needed to beat a filibuster — and without amendments or the possibility of a filibuster by the minority party. The majority party sometimes attaches nonbudget legislation to a reconcilation measure to move it more expeditiously. For a fuller explanation, see the official definition

here

.
 
Bottom line, when your party's in power, you probably like it. And when it's not, you probably don't.
 
""It is interesting to see the views on reconciliation and how they've changed since, say, the Bush tax cuts in 2001,"" White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said on March 23.
 
Sen. Judd Gregg, who was briefly under consideration to serve in Obama's Cabinet as commerce secretary, has been the loudest Republican voice opposing the possibility of reconciliation. And he's also been singled out as an example of how Republicans have been hypocritical on the issue.
 
In remarks on the Senate floor on March 17 criticizing President Barack Obama's proposed budget, Gregg spent nearly half of his time railing against the possibility of reconciliation.
 
""You're talking about the exact opposite of bipartisan,"" Gregg said. ""You're talking about running over the minority, putting them in cement, and throwing them in the Chicago River. Basically, it takes the minority completely out of the process of having a right to have any discussion, say, or even the right to amend something so fundamental as a piece of legislation of this significance. ... So using reconciliation in this manner on this type of an issue would do fundamental harm, fundamental harm, to the institution of the Senate. I mean, why have a Senate if you're going to do reconciliation on something this significant? You might as well go to a unicameral body. Be like Canada. Have one body and have it be the House of Representatives because that will be the practical effect of using reconciliation here.""
 
Contrast that, as the

New York Times


did

, with Gregg's position in 2005, when Democrats complained about the use of budget reconciliation to open the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil drilling. Gregg called their objections ""inappropriate"" and said, ""We are using rules of the Senate here. Is there something wrong with majority rules? I don't think so.""
 
So is that a simple flip-flop?
 
Maybe not completely. First, it's important to recognize that in his statements about reconciliation over the past two weeks, Gregg has been upfront about his support of the policy in the past. But he has consistently said that what's different this time is that it is being talked about as a way to slam through major initiatives — health care reform and the cap-and-trade plan to limit industries' carbon emissions, which is likely to result in higher energy costs to consumers.
 
""Sometimes over the years (reconciliation) has been used in an aggressive way,"" Gregg said. ""It was used to adjust already existing programs, authorized programs, entitlement programs, and tax proposals. President Bush used it aggressively on taxes. In 1997, President Clinton used it aggressively along with a Republican Congress on everything — entitlement and taxes. But it was always directed at existing policy and adjusting that policy. In other words, raising the tax rate or dropping the tax rate, changing an entitlement program in some way that already existed or not changing an entitlement program.
 
""Reconciliation has never been used for the purposes of putting in place a dramatic new federal program which will fundamentally shift the way the government functions in this country,"" Gregg said. ""It has never been used in the sense as an initiating event. The carbon tax or the national sales tax on electric bills is a massive exercise in industrial policy, totally redirecting how energy is produced in this nation and affecting everybody in this nation. ... Obviously rewriting the health care system of this country is a dramatic exercise affecting absolutely everyone in this nation at all sorts of different levels, a brand-new major program. These are initiatives of significant size and import.""
 
Our review of the instances when reconciliation has been used indicates Gregg is correct and that it's been used for less dramatic policy changes. And so Gregg doesn't get a Full Flop. But we find his arguments — made repeatedly in several press conferences and political news programs — that the tactic ""totally undermines the purposes of the two branches of government"" a bit hypocritical in light of his prior statements in support of reconciliation. And so we rate it a Half Flip.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'House Republican Conference']","
GOP full of hot air about Obama's ""light switch tax""
","
Taxpayers may have been shocked to learn from House Republicans that President Barack Obama wants to pay for health care by charging them to turn on a light.
 
""The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year,"" the House Republican Conference said in a Web post and press release titled ""Questions on the Budget for President Obama,"" distributed March 24. ""What effect will this have on Americans struggling to pay their mortgages?"" it asked.
 
This alleged ""light switch tax"" is a reference to Obama's proposal to tax power companies for carbon dioxide emissions, and allow companies to trade emissions credits among themselves. That's called a cap-and-trade program, and Republicans say the companies would just pass the tax on to electricity consumers.
 
So any revenue raised by a cap-and-trade program amounts to a ""light switch tax"" on consumers, the House Republicans alleged.
 
To back up the claim, their staff pointed us to an

M.I.T. report

that says a similar a cap-and-trade proposal (the administration has not yet detailed their own version) would raise $366 billion per year. If you divide that by the 117 million households in the United States, you find it would cost each household $3,128, they said.
 
But is it that simple? Can you just assume consumers would be out $366 billion since that's how much the program would raise from fuel companies?
 
No.
 
""It's just wrong,"" said John Reilly, an energy, environmental and agricultural economist at M.I.T. and one of the authors of the report. ""It's wrong in so many ways it's hard to begin.""
 
Not only is it wrong, but he told the House Republicans it was wrong when they asked him.
 
""Someone from the House Republicans had called me (March 20) and asked about this,"" Reilly said. ""I had explained why the estimate they had was probably incorrect and what they should do to correct it, but I think this wrong number was already floating around by that time.""
 
It continues to float.
 
That's just not how economists calculate the cost of a tax proposal, Reilly said. The tax might push the price of carbon-based fuels up a bit, but other results of a cap-and-trade program, such as increased conservation and more competition from other fuel sources, would put downward pressure on prices. Moreover, consumers would get some of the tax back from the government in some form.
 
The report did include an estimate of the net cost to individuals, called the ""welfare"" cost. It would be $30.89 per person in 2015, or $79 per family if you use the same average household size the Republicans used of 2.56 people.
 
The cost would grow over time as the program ramps up, but the average annual cost over time in today's dollars — that is, the ""average annual net present value cost"" — is still just $85 per person, Reilly said. That would be $215.05 per household.
 
A far cry from $3,128. And that isn't the only inaccuracy in the claim.
 
The Republican press release said the cap-and-trade program would pay for ""nationalized health care.""
 
But Obama's

health care proposal

is not for ""nationalized health care."" It does call for a ""National Health Insurance Exchange"" with private insurance options plus a new public plan based on the one currently available to members of Congress — but consumers could still keep their private insurance if they want, as Obama emphasized during his presidential campaign.
 
Even if it were true that Obama wants to nationalize health care, he does not envision paying for health care reform with the cap-and-trade program as the Republicans alleged. Rather, his $634 billion health care reserve fund is to come from efficiencies in Medicare and Medicaid and decreased deductions for some charitable contributions by upper-income taxpayers, according to Obama's proposed budget.
 
The House Republicans partially corrected this portion of the claim, changing their Web site and sending out an updated press release that says the cap-and-trade program would pay for ""increased spending"" rather than health care.
 
But it still calls cap-and-trade a ""light switch tax"" and claims the whole cost would come from consumers.
 
If the Republicans had simply misstated the results of the MIT study, the Truth-O-Meter would have been content giving this one a False. But for them to keep repeating the claim after the author of the study told them it was wrong means we have to set the meter ablaze. Pants on Fire.
 

Update, May 6, 2009

 
Two days after we published this item, Reilly sent a letter to Rep. John Boehner, the Republican leader in the House, complaining that his study ""has been misrepresented in recent press releases distributed by the National Republican Congressional Committee. The press release claims our report estimates an average cost per family of a carbon cap and trade program that would meet targets now being discussed in Congress to be over $3,000, but that is nearly 10 times the correct estimate, which is approximately $340."" (The $340 is a cost per family of four, comparable to the $215 we used as the cost per household of 2.56 people.)
 
Reilly said it was ""simplistic and misleading"" to interpret the statistics the way the Republicans did because the administration's cap and trade proposal has ""been designed to offset the energy cost impacts on middle and lower income households.""
 
A day later Boehner responded with a statement that insisted $3,128 was accurate. ""In reality, it would be a tax of up to $3,100 per family on every American family that drives a car, buys products manufactured in the United States, or flips on a light switch,"" Boehner said in the statement.
 
On April 22, the conservative

Weekly Standard

came to the defense of the Republicans and published

an article

that said Reilly had erred in calculating the cost. It said that Reilly had since corrected the figure from the original $340 to $800. The article by John McCormack, an editorial assistant at the publication, said that even with the corrected figure, Reilly was ""still low-balling the cost of cap and trade by using some fuzzy logic. In reality, cap and trade could cost the average household more than $3,900 per year.""
 
The

Weekly Standard

noted that Obama plans to use some of the cap-and-trade revenues to fund his ""making work pay"" tax credit of $400 per individual and $800 per family per year but then did not reflect that plan in the ultimate cost to households. It said there was no proof that Reilly is correct to assume that ""the $3,128 will be 'returned' to each household."" The article also said that our PolitiFact item was incorrect because we relied on Reilly's numbers.
 
Several PolitiFact readers who apparently believe that Reilly's corrected figure means the Republicans are now accurate, wrote to us and urged us to publish a correction. So we have revisited the numbers to provide this update.
 
First, we should emphasize that our original item was simple and straightforward. The Republicans said their claim was based on the MIT study. But Reilly, the author of that study, said the Republicans were misrepresenting his work. And not only that, he said he'd told them they were misrepresenting his work

before

they made the claim, and they made the claim anyway. That struck us as an egregious falsehood.
 
And it's important to recognize that our Pants on Fire rating was on the overall statement that, ""The administration raises revenue for nationalized health care through a series of new taxes, including a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year."" The first part of that statement about nationalized health care is completely false. The Obama administration is not proposing nationalized health care, a phrase we believe is meant to invoke fears of socialized medicine. Yet Republicans have repeatedly made that inaccurate claim. So that part of the claim was and remains ridiculously false.
 
Now, in light of Reilly's revised number and Boehner's refusal to change what he says, let's reconsider the second part of the claim, that the Obama administration is proposing ""a light switch tax that would cost every American household $3,128 a year.""
 
First, calling it a light switch tax remains incorrect. That implies that it is a federal tax levied on consumers when in fact it is an extrapolation of the per-family burden of a new federal charge that would be levied on energy companies. To say it ""would cost every American household $3,128 a year"" suggests tremendous precision. But we have found virtually no precision about anything to do with the cap and trade proposals because they are still very much just in the talking stages. Indeed, the House Democratic version is known as the ""discussion draft"" and, although there are some broad concepts, key details about how the program would work, its ultimate cost and how Americans would be reimbursed for higher energy costs are still far from final.
 
But, given Reilly's corrected number, is it now accurate to say it will cost every household $3,128 a year?
 
No, it's not. As we said in our original item, Reilly's analysis has produced two different ways to measure the cost of a cap and trade system. One way is the total estimate of federal revenues from a cap and trade auction, which indeed works out to $3,128 per family in the United States. That's the amount of money the energy companies would have to pay the federal government, and presumably the companies would pass those costs to consumers through higher prices.
 
The issue then becomes whether or not the Obama administration intends to offset that cost to families. Republicans take the position, which was echoed by the

Weekly Standard,

that the Obama administration has no such plans. Reilly says the administration does.
 
Who's right? Of course, we can't really know what the administration intends to do, but the available record makes it pretty clear that the White House has made plans to return to families the money the cap and trade program might cost them in energy bills. Some of it -- $400 per year for individuals, $800 for families -- would go directly back to families through the ""making work pay"" tax credit totalling $65 billion per year, according to

the Obama budget proposal

. An additional $15 billion per year would benefit them indirectly through research and development on clean energy technologies. And the budget specifies that ""all additional net proceeds will be used to further compensate the public.""  That backs up Reilly's claim that the $3,128 is effectively returned to people.
 
The second way to look at the cost of cap and trade is through the impact the proposal would have on the overall economy -- the extent to which the new system would constrain the economy and slow its growth. That's the source of Reilly's $340 number, which he has corrected to $800. That number is still far short of the very precise $3,128 the Republicans have been using. And Republican leaders continue to toss around the $3,100 number, often with no caveats or qualifiers -- or mention of the $800.
 
We called Reilly to get his reaction to the article in the

Weekly Standard

and the Republicans' latest claim

.

He said the

Weekly Standard

editorial assistant who wrote the story ""just completely twisted the whole thing.""
 
He said his correction to the $800 figure didn't substantially improve the accuracy of what the Republicans are contending. Their claim ""is a misrepresentation. They are basing (the $3,128) on our study and that is an incorrect use of our study. It's false.""
 
Here at PolitiFact, we're sure there will be plenty of other claims in the next few months that will allow us to further examine the cost of a cap and trade proposal. This claim has centered on Reilly's two-year-old study, but other studies have been done more recently and will soon be in the political mix.
 
But for now, this claim remains a serious distortion in many ways. It is a ridiculous falsehood to say the money is being used ""for nationalized health care."" It is inaccurate to call it a ""light switch tax."" And it is incorrect to cite a precise ""tax"" of $3,128 -- with no caveats or qualifiers -- when the Obama administration has specified how the money would be returned to people. Given Reilly's comments that they are using his numbers improperly, we see nothing to change our conclusion. So our original ruling stands: Pants on Fire.

Republican budget proposal lacks numbers on revenues and costs
","
The back and forth over President Barack Obama's budget has gone like this: Republicans say it's big and costly and will saddle future generations with too much debt. Obama complains the Republicans are the party of ""no"" and don't have their own plan. Republicans finally release their own plan.
 
""The Republican Road to Recovery"" is a 19-page document released March 26 that includes sections on curbing spending, creating jobs, lowering taxes and controlling debt.
 
But it came under quick criticism from White House officials who said it was remarkably short on specifics — so much, in fact, that it doesn’t contain actual numbers about how much the Republicans would spend on various areas of the government.
 
""It's interesting to have a budget that doesn't contain any numbers. I think the party of 'no' has become the party of 'no new ideas,' "" said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs.
 
""I think the administration is glad that the Republicans heard the president's call to submit an alternative. We just hope that next time it will contain actual numbers so somebody can evaluate what it means,"" he added.
 
A reporter asked him if wasn't being a little snarky there.
 
""I think if I intoned to you that I would produce a 20-page document that outlined my budget priorities, that it might actually contain a chart with some numbers. I don't think that's a whole lot to ask,"" Gibbs answered.
 
We were curious if Gibbs was right that the Republican budget outline contained no numbers, or if he was just being snarky. So we downloaded the Republican document and read it.
 
We found Gibbs is right. It's a budget proposal without proposing actual numbers.
 
It's not very long, and you might even want to

read it for yourself

. But if you don't want to, here's our quick summary:
 
•  Spending: The Republican plan says the Obama budget spends too much and is ""reckless."" The Republicans say they would undo wasteful spending from recent legislation such as the economic stimulus bill and the omnibus spending bill for this year. But they don't specify what programs or how much. The Republican plan also says it would ""cut overall nondefense spending by reforming or eliminating a host of wasteful programs deemed ineffective by various government entities."" So what programs and how much? The plan doesn't say.
 
•  Lowering taxes and creating jobs: In a rare moment of specificity, the Republican plan says it would rewrite the tax code so that people making up to $100,000 would be taxed at a marginal rate of 10 percent and everyone above that would be taxed 25 percent. Fair enough. So how much would that cost? The plan doesn't say. It offers a few other tax-cutting ideas — tax deductions for businesses and an overall vow to keep the Bush tax cuts — but again there are no estimates about the impact on revenues.
 
•  Controlling debt: The Republican plan says it will control debt by ending spending on bailouts for Wall Street. For a savings of ... hmm, doesn't say. The plan also opposes runaway inflation and promotes keeping the cost of living low for families and entrepreneurs. Sounds great! What that means for the federal budget, we couldn't tell you.
 
Now, we should note that the Republican document has some numbers in it. But they're numbers about Obama's budget, used to illustrate the party's complaints, under labels like ""Future Debt Burden"" and ""Expanding the Size of Government."" 
 
What the Republican plan lacks is the numbers that really matter, numbers that would show how much the Republicans propose to spend on various parts of government.
 
There are many pressing questions in the public debate that an alternative budget could answer. For example, if we're going want to cut wasteful spending, what programs should be cut? Also, what will cutting taxes do to deficit projections in years to come? But the Republican plan doesn't provide any answers.
 
The Republican House leaders said they will be releasing more data next week. Perhaps that will include some numbers. But Gibbs was right. The first version of the ""Republican Road to Recovery"" is a budget without budget numbers. We find Gibbs' statement to be True.

Secret ballots would be rare, but not eliminated
","
Business groups and other opponents of a bill to make union organizing easier contend that the measure would eliminate the secret ballot in union elections.
 
This is point one from the

U.S. Chamber of Commerce

, which is leading the opposition. Rush Limbaugh discussed the topic on March 10 and said ""you cannot vote in private"" under the bill.
 
And Sen. Arlen Specter, the Pennsylvania Republican who dealt a severe blow to the bill's prospects when he announced his opposition March 24, cited the issue as his primary concern.
 
""On the merits, the issue which has emerged at the top of the list for me is the elimination of the secret ballot, which is the cornerstone of how contests are decided in a democratic society,"" Specter said on the floor of the Senate.
 
Here's how union elections work now:
 
Union organizers try to get employees in a particular business or unit of a business to sign cards indicating they want the union to represent them in negotiations with the employer. The employer is not permitted to see the cards before they are turned in to the National Labor Relations Board — or often even after that — or engage in any other kind of surveillance to try to discern which employees are union adherents and which are not.
 
If more than 30 percent of the employees sign, the union can ask the National Labor Relations Board to conduct an election. If more than 50 percent sign, the employer must either accept the union or ask the board for an election.
 
Most employers ask for an election. It takes place a few weeks later at the employer's place of business. It's a secret-ballot election and is run by the National Labor Relations Board. If a majority votes for the union, the union wins.
 
Here's what would happen under the Employee Free Choice Act:
 
Just like before, if unions got more than 30 percent of the employees to sign cards, they could ask for a secret-ballot election. But if they got more than 50 percent, the union would win automatically. The employer would no longer have the right to insist on a secret-ballot election and would have to negotiate with the union. 
 
""Decertification"" elections, where the employees vote on whether to cease being represented by their union, are currently secret-ballot elections, and would continue to be under the Employee Free Choice Act.
 
As a practical matter, secret-ballot elections would be far less frequent if the Employee Free Choice Act were passed. But they would still take place under certain circumstances: during decertification contests, or on the occasions where unions won the support of more than 30 percent but less than 50 percent of the employees (but unions don't generally ask for elections unless they have the support of more than half).
 
There would also continue to be secret-ballot elections in instances where a majority of employees say they want one. That is, where more than 50 percent of the employees sign cards requesting a vote on unionization rather than cards saying they want a union to represent them.
 
So we find Specter's claim to be Mostly True.

Judd Gregg says Obama's budget drives national debt to 80 percent of GDP
","
Sen. Judd Gregg, a Republican senator from New Hampshire, has been making the rounds on political news programs this week, criticizing President Barack Obama's budget as too costly.
 
Gregg has repeated one statistic over and over to make his point: that Obama's budget plan would increase the national debt to 80 percent of gross domestic product.
 
""Seventeen trillion dollars worth of debt at the end of 10 years, $11 trillion at the end of five years,"" Gregg said. ""This translates into a debt-to-GDP ratio which we have not seen in this country since the end of World War II when we were trying to pay off the war debt. Basically, you take national debt up to about 80 percent of gross national product. That's the public debt. Historically, it's been about 40 percent.""
 
At 80 percent, Gregg has been fond of saying this week, the United States would be getting into ""banana republic"" territory.
 
Debt-to-GDP ratios may not get a lot of public attention, but economists follow them closely as a good indicator of economic health.
 
""Over the long haul, that is the most important number,"" Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
 
Gregg's numbers come from an analysis of the Obama budget by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which concluded that the national debt would grow by $9.3 trillion between 2010 and 2019 under Obama's plan. According to the CBO, the debt held by the public would rise, from 41 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2008 to 57 percent in 2009 and then to 82 percent of GDP by 2019. That comports with Gregg's statement.
 
Projections put out by the administration's Office of Management and Budget in February were a little more optimistic, due largely to differing assumptions about the future growth of the economy. According to the White House forecasts, the national debt-to-GDP ration would rise to 67 percent in 2019.
 
Still, by either count, the debt-to-GDP ratios are climbing.
 
Gregg is right that since the post-World War II years, debt-to-GDP has averaged about 42 percent. He's also right that if the debt-to-GDP ratio rises to 82 percent in 2019, that would be a level we have not seen in the United States since World War II. According to historical budget tables, the debt-to-GDP ratios actually climbed over 100 percent, peaking at 109 percent in 1946. Since then, the ratios have spiked occasionally as a result of recession or war, but have never gone above about 50 percent. That will change this year.
 
It's less clear if that 82 percent would put us in the ""banana republic"" range. According to the

CIA World Factbook,

the United States has the 22nd highest level of public debt as a percentage of GDP in the world. There are no separate statistics for banana republics, but it's worth noting that many Latin American countries have a lower public debt ratio than the United States.
 
Regardless, Gregg is right that 82 percent would be remarkably high and put the country in unenviable company.
 
So why should we care?
 
If the debt-to-GDP level were to go to 82 percent, Heritage's Riedl said, ""It's a simple fact that interest rates would go through the roof.""
 
Moreover, he said, it would be harder for companies to borrow money; harder for people to get mortgages. It would decrease productivity and overall economic growth.
 
""It's just not a sustainable ratio,"" Riedl said.
 
Jonathan DeWald, a spokesman for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that specializes in analysis of budget deficits, also cautioned that as interest rates increase in coming years, interest payments on the growing national debt will continue to eat up more and more of the overall budget.
 
Obama has warned not to place too much stock in the ""out years"" of budget projections because ""none of us know exactly what's going to happen six or eight or 10 years from now."" And Obama has said that making investments today in education, health care and energy will pay off down the road with a stronger economy, which presumably would create a better debt-to-GDP ratio.
 
Gregg is on solid ground, relying on projections from the CBO, a highly respected, nonpartisan arm of Congress, about the long-term debt-to-GDP ratios. We rate his statement True.

Obama promises to cut the deficit in half in four years
","
Defending his budget at a news conference on March 24, President Barack Obama repeated his claim that his plan would cut the deficit in half in five years.
 
""Both under our estimates and under the CBO estimates, both the most conservative estimates out there, we drive down the deficit over the first five years of our budget,"" Obama said. ""The deficit is cut in half.  And folks aren't disputing that.""
 
Earlier in the news conference, Obama said he'd cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term. So we'll look at the picture from four and five years out.
 
According to projections in the Obama administration's

proposed budget

, released at the end of February, the yearly deficit would go from $1.75 trillion in 2009 to $533 billion in 2013 and $570 billion in 2014. So obviously, by the administration's estimation, the deficit would be cut well more than half whether you measure it until the end of Obama's first term (four years), or five years out.
 
The Congressional Budget Office

projections

— released a month later — were not as optimistic. The CBO, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, projected the 2009 deficit at $1.8 trillion, and forecast it would taper down to $672 billion in 2013, then to $749 billion in 2014. Still, even those numbers support Obama's assertion that he'd halve the deficit.
 
So technically, Obama is correct. But it's a bit misleading.
 
When Obama says he will halve the deficit, he's comparing it to a 2009 deficit that is massive and far, far above the norm. It's a deficit fueled by a major recession (translation: lost tax revenue) and boosted by costly recession-fixers like the bailouts last fall and the economic stimulus package passed in February. For comparison purposes, we note that the deficit in 2008 was $459 billion (and less than half that the year before). So the deficit is expected to nearly quadruple in 2009.
 
That's the number Obama promises to cut in half.
 
""It’s true, but it's very misleading,"" said Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation. ""It's true because they quadrupled the deficit this year and then they'll cut that in half."" Riedl notes that Obama's projected deficits in four and five years will be ""significantly higher"" than deficits before the recession.
 
""It's quite easy to cut

that

in half,"" echoed Jonathan DeWald, a spokesman for the Concord Coalition, a nonpartisan organization that specializes in analysis of budget deficits.
 
Obama was quick to point out that he inherited much of this year's goliath deficit. And he's mostly right. The deficit began skyrocketing before Obama ever took office. In January, the CBO projected the 2009 deficit would balloon to $1.2 trillion. A worsening economy, the burden of the economic stimulus package, and projected spending in Obama's budget led the CBO in late March to revise its 2009 deficit projection to $1.8 trillion. So Obama can't claim that he inherited the entire deficit. But suffice to say the huge jump in the 2009 deficit is not a result of Obama's proposed budget.
 
We note one other point. Although Obama's budget plan is expected to more than halve the 2009 projected deficit in four and five years out, after that, the CBO projects that deficits will begin to grow again, and significantly. The CBO's 10-year outlook predicts a deficit of $1.2 trillion in 2019. That's far more pessimistic than the Obama administration's projections, which Obama rightly attributed in the news conference to different assumptions about the future growth of the economy.


""Now, none of us know exactly what's going to happen six or eight or 10 years from now,"" Obama said. ""Here's what I do know: If we don't tackle energy, if we don't improve our education system, if we don't drive down the costs of health care, if we're not making serious investments in science and technology and our infrastructure, then we won't grow 2.6 percent, we won't grow 2.2 percent. We won't grow.""
 
And to be extra clear, deficits are one-year snapshots. They represent a revenue versus expenses picture for that year. In other words, Obama is not saying he will be cutting the national debt by half in four or five years. To the contrary, the CBO projects the running total of the country's national debt — which was around $7 trillion when Obama took office — will increase to nearly $12 trillion in four years.
 
In summary, Obama is correct when he says the CBO predicts that under Obama's budget plan, the deficit would be cut in half in five year. But he's comparing it to a year we all hope is a major anomaly, which makes the dramatic-sounding achievement much easier. So we rule his statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Barack Obama']","
Obama's claim about discretionary spending relies on one number
","
Under fire from Republicans for his proposed budget, President Obama has been using a couple of comebacks.
 
He says his proposed budgets would cut the deficit in half in five years (a claim we rated

Mostly True

) and that they would reduce ""nondefense discretionary spending"" (a key phrase that we'll explain shortly) to historically low levels.
 
At a White House news conference on March 24, Obama said that under his plans, the NDD spending (we're not fond of acronyms, but we'll use NDD because nondefense discretionary spending is such a mouthful) will fall to its lowest level since the 1960s.
 
Asked by a reporter about long-term estimates that show growth in spending under his budget, Obama said much of the growth is in mandatory programs such as Medicare and Medicaid that go up automatically. ""We're very serious about working on a bipartisan basis to reduce those deficits, or reduce those costs — you're not going to see those savings reflected until much later.""

 

But he indicated that his administration was also being fiscally responsible. ""Just to give one other example — as a percentage of gross domestic product, we are reducing nondefense discretionary spending to its lowest level since the '60s — lower than it was under Reagan, lower than it was under Clinton, lower than it was under Bush — or both Bushes.""
 
We wondered if that was true. But first, we should explain a couple of basic concepts.
 
Policymakers focus on the NDD spending because it's the part of the budget that the president and Congress can most easily control. The mandatory programs are just that — mandatory. They include Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, programs that go up automatically based on how many people are eligible.
 
Defense costs are often excluded because they are subject to outside forces such as whether the United States is at war. So that leaves NDD as everything else the government spends money on — education, agriculture, transportation, social programs, NASA, and a host of other things.
 
Policymakers often measure government spending against the gross domestic product, the total output of the U.S. economy, to show the relative share of government spending in the overall economy.
 
So now let's examine Obama's claim. First, we should note that although it was clear Obama was talking about the long-term impact of his budget, he didn't specify a time frame. A listener might not know if he was talking about the first five years or the last five, or some other period.
 
That allowed him to do some cherry-picking, to rely on the one number that supports his point when others do not. Indeed, he achieves that historic spending level only once in his 10-year-projection — in 2019, the final year, according to numbers from his Office of Management and Budget.
 
(We should note that, unless the constitutional term limit is changed before then, even if he wins a second term, Obama will be out of office in January 2017, two years before we can see if his budget projections came true.)
 
Also, it's important to note that these are

White House

estimates. Administration officials say they are based on realistic policy decisions for future years, but the numbers have been criticized for being too optimistic.
 
Brian Riedl, a budget analyst for the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, said Obama is using unrealistic numbers to make his spending appear lower.
 
""This is a complete gimmick,"" Riedl said, adding that ""President Bush played the same game.""
 
Indeed, this is a standard ploy for presidents to promise to meet goals in later years when the circumstances are beyond their control.
 
Presidents assume very low growth in government spending for the long-term to make their budgets look more lean. But when those years come, they usually propose much higher spending, Riedl said.
 
At the news conference, Obama acknowledged that his analysis was relying on GDP projections that are more optimistic than the ones from the Congressional Budget Office, a well-respected nonpartisan group. But he said his numbers were in line with other prominent economists.
 
So where does this leave us? Obama's claim is that ""we are reducing nondefense discretionary spending to its lowest level since the '60s."" 
 
Although his statement suggests broad success, he achieves the historic level only in the last year. Yes, it would be lower than the other presidents, but it would beat the lowest number only in 2019 — a year when Obama will be out of office. And he relies on economic assumptions that are slightly more optimistic than the ones from the well-respected CBO. So we find Obama's claim to be Barely True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Judd Gregg']","
Judd Gregg says Obama's budget doubles the national debt in five years
","
You remember Judd Gregg, the Republican senator from New Hampshire tapped by President Obama to be commerce secretary. He was one of Obama's celebrated bipartisan Cabinet picks, but then withdrew his nomination in February, citing ""irresolvable conflicts"" with the Obama agenda.
 
Conflicts indeed.
 
This week, Gregg has appeared on several news programs lambasting Obama's proposed 2010 budget, saying it runs up so much debt ""it basically will bankrupt our children and our children's children.""
 
In what has become a familiar talking point from Republican opponents, Gregg told Fox News on March 25 that Obama's budget ""doubles the (national) debt in five years, triples it in 10 years.""
 
To check the claim, we relied on an analysis from the Congressional Budget Office, released on March 20. The CBO, a nonpartisan arm of Congress, projects that the national debt will go from $5.8 trillion in 2008 to $11.8 trillion by the end of 2013; and to $17.3 trillion in 2019. By that count, Gregg's claim of doubling the debt in five years, tripling it in 10 years, is correct. But we think that's a little unfair.
 
In January, the CBO projected the one-year 2009 deficit at $1.2 trillion. Remember, that's the 2009 fiscal year, which began in October 2008. That deficit was worse because of the recession, and grew because of a financial bailout plan in the fall. To be fair, we don't think Obama's record ought to be saddled with something that passed under President Bush.
 
So let's add that $1.2 trillion that was largely started under Bush to the $5.8 trillion in national debt accumulated through fiscal year 2008. That comes to roughly $7 trillion. Under that scenario, the CBO's projections don't quite translate to a doubling of the national debt in 5 years ($7 trillion to $11.8 trillion). Nor does it fully support the claim that the debt would triple in 10 years ($7 trillion to $17.3 trillion). But it's not outrageously off either.
 
In another item, we looked at Obama's claim that his budget plan would cut the deficit in half in five years. We found that while technically true, it is a bit misleading because it uses 2009's massive deficit as a comparator. Obama and others in his administration have cited this stat along with sentiments that we can't ""pass on our problems to the next generation.""
 
This is a good time to note the difference between the deficit, a calculation of the difference between what the government takes in versus what it spends in any given year, as opposed to the national debt, which is a running tally of what the U.S. government owes. That's why it's possible that Obama is technically accurate when he says the CBO projects his plan will halve the

deficit

in five years; while the national

debt

will grow by $4.6 trillion over the same stretch.
 
""It's the biggest transfer of debt onto future generations in American history,"" said Brian Riedl, a research fellow in federal budget policy at the conservative Heritage Foundation.
 
The Obama administration's projections aren't as dire as the CBO's. While the CBO projects the national debt to rise $9.3 trillion in 10 years; the administration projects it will grow by $7 trillion.
 
In a prime-time news conference on March 24, Obama said the difference is due to the administration's slightly more optimistic outlook on future economic growth. Obama warned not to place too much stock in the ""out years"" of budget projections because ""none of us know exactly what's going to happen six or eight or 10 years from now."" And, he said, it's just his first of many budgets moving forward.
 
As for Gregg's claim, we think that based on CBO projections, his numbers come up a little short of ""double in five years, triple in 10."" But they're not grossly misrepresentative of the CBO's projections, which we think is as fair a measure as any. And so we rate his statement Mostly True.

"['National', 'Taxes', 'Cynthia Lummis']","
Cynthia Lummis claims families who make over $250,000 would lose their mortgage and charitable deductions under Obama plan
","
At  the weekly Republican leadership news conference on March 24, members took turns taking shots at President Barack Obama's proposed budget.
 
One of them, Rep. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., took up the cause of a Kansas tumbleweed farmer to drive home her point.
 
""Every small business in this country will be affected by the president’s budget,"" Lummis said. ""I think of a couple in Kansas. The woman in the family sells tumbleweeds for a living to augment their family farming salary. But they better not make more than $250,000 a year or they’re going to lose their mortgage deduction, their charitable deductions, their taxes are going to go up. So there is a cap now on the American dream. Especially the American entrepreneurial dream for small businesses.""
 
We wondered if selling tumbleweeds was a path to the American Dream, but a quick check on the Web set us straight about the public appetite for the dried brush. Apparently, there are enough TV producers in need of props and home decorators with an affinity for the American West for some people to make good money selling tumbleweeds.
 
But we digress.


The issue here is whether the family of our tumbleweed farmer, or any other family that makes more than $250,000, would lose their mortgage and/or charitable deductions under Obama's plan.
 
That would be a shocking change because the mortgage deduction enjoys sacred protection in American tax law, and the charitable contribution deduction isn't far behind.
 
To check out her claim, we went right to the Obama administration's proposed budget. In a section that talks about offsetting the cost of lowering health care expenses and expanding health insurance coverage, there is a proposal to reduce itemized deduction rates for families with incomes over $250,000. The plan is to ""limit the tax rate at which high-income taxpayer can take itemized deductions to 28 percent.""
 
So for families in higher tax brackets, say 36 or 39 percent, they'd only be able to write off 28 cents on the dollar (as opposed to 36 or 39 cents), said Eric Toder of the Tax Policy Center. Say you are in a tax bracket where you pay a 36 percent rate; if you had $1,000 a year in mortgage interest payments, you'd currently be able to deduct $360. Under Obama's plan, you'd only be able to deduct $280.
 
""You won't lose the deduction,"" Toder said. ""It would be pared back. But it'd be inaccurate to say you'd lose it.""
 
Same thing with charitable deductions. They wouldn't be lost, as Lummis suggests, they would simply be scaled back.
 
And judging by the less-than-enthusiastic reaction this proposal has received in Congress, Toder doubts it will be enacted anyway.
 
(Now, Lummis is right that families making over $250,000 would see an overall tax hike under Obama's plan. That was a hallmark of Obama's campaign. Essentially, Obama would allow the Bush tax cuts for those earners to expire next year. That would raise the tax rates for some from 33 to 36 percent; for others from 35 to 39.6 percent.)
 
We'll allow for a bit of hyperbole in Lummis' statement that raising tax rates for families making over $250,000 amounts to putting a cap on the American Dream.
 
What we find egregious is her claim that these high earners would ""lose"" their mortgage and charitable deductions. She's alleging that Obama wants to eliminate a sacred cow, a cherished deduction for decades. But that is just patently false, alarmist, and a complete distortion of the administration's budget proposal.
 
We rate her statement Pants on Fire.

Republicans accuse nominee Johnsen of supporting abortion rights but opposing motherhood
","
Republicans have made it clear they're opposed to the nomination of Dawn Johnsen to head the White House Office of Legal Counsel. They're unhappy with her support of abortion rights, but a recent blog posting made a surprising allegation: That she said motherhood was ""involuntary servitude.""
 
We wondered if she was really was so impolitic as to attack motherhood. And if so, does she have it in for apple pie as well?
 
The allegation came from the Web site of the House Republican Conference:
 
""At least 45 House Republicans have co-signed a letter to President Barack Obama in opposition to his nomination of Dawn Johnson [sic] for the head of the Office of Legal Counsel,"" the site says in a

blog post

. The post continued: ""Her brazen pro-abortion stances [include] a Supreme Court amicus brief where she called motherhood 'involuntary servitude.'""
 
The Republicans are referring to a 1989 brief in

Webster vs. Reproductive Health Services,

a case that tested whether states could prohibit abortions in public health institutions. Johnsen was then legal director of the National Abortion Rights Action League, one of 77 organizations to sign the brief.
 
Footnote 23, part of the brief that Johnsen said in a Senate hearing that she wrote, said the following: ""While a woman might choose to bear children gladly and voluntarily, statutes that curtail her abortion choice are disturbingly suggestive of involuntary servitude, prohibited by the Thirteenth Amendment, in that forced pregnancy requires a woman to provide continuous physical service to the fetus in order to further the state's asserted interest. Indeed, the actual process of delivery demands work of the most intense and physical kind: labor of 12 or more grueling hours of contractions is not uncommon.""
 
So Johnsen compared ""forced pregnancy"" — not motherhood — to involuntary servitude.
 
After we asked the Republican Conference about the claim, staffer Ericka Andersen acknowledged it was wrong. ""You are correct that the post was written inaccurately,"" she told us in an e-mail. She corrected the post to say Johnsen ""equated forced pregnancy with 'involuntary servitude.'""
 
Kudos to the conference for acknowledging the error. But we still find the original claim False.

Billionaire Warren Buffett still backs Obama
","
The Oracle of Omaha is still for Obama. So the president claimed on

60 Minutes

, interrupting interviewer Steve Kroft to tout the continued support of Warren Buffett, the Omaha-based stock-picker extraordinaire. 
 
""Your plan really for solving the banking crisis was met with very, very, very tepid response,"" Kroft said to Obama. ""A lot of people said they didn't understand it. A lot of people said it didn't have any, enough details to solve the problem. I know you're coming out with something next week on this. But these criticisms were coming from people like Warren Buffett, people who had supported you, and you had counted as being your...""
 
""And Warren still does support me,"" Obama interjected. ""But I think that, understand, Warren's also a big player in the financial markets who's a major owner of Wells Fargo. And so he's got a perspective from the perspective of somebody who is part owner of a bank.""
 
Indeed Buffett, who endorsed Obama during the campaign, did explicitly say during a three-hour interview March 9 with CNBC that he still supports Obama.
 
""I voted for Obama and I strongly support him, and I think he's the right guy,"" Buffett said early in the interview.


Buffett did criticize Obama's handling of the banking crisis, saying that ""a bank that's going to go broke should be allowed to go broke,"" as long as the depositors are protected. (Obama's approach has leaned toward giving the banks more bailout money in some form rather than letting them fail and having the government take them over.)


But Buffett's primary concern was that Obama wasn't communicating clearly with the public about struggling banks. ""The right answer for me (to the banking crisis) is the president to clarify things as only he can, because you have heard so many different things,"" he said. ""He is the commander in chief on this, and it has to be clarified ... because if people aren't clear, they're going to be confused. And if they're going to be confused, they are going to be scared stiff. And that has to end.""


It's not surprising Buffett would want Obama to focus on the financial crisis — it has cost Buffett $25 billion. That's how much of his $62 billion fortune he lost in the past year, as shares of his holding company Berkshire Hathaway fell nearly 50 percent,

Forbes

reports. That knocked Buffett off his perch as the world's richest man, to No. 2 behind Bill Gates.


Toward the end of the three-hour interview, Buffett reiterated his support for Obama. ""He is the right president,"" Buffett said. ""He's very, very smart. He's got, I think, exactly the right goals. He's articulate and I — you know, he will be the right person to be the commander in chief in this economic crisis.""


So clearly Obama was on solid ground touting Buffett's continued support. We find this claim to be True.

"['National', 'Health Care', 'States', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says 'health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country'
","When President Barack Obama went to Boston on Oct. 30, 2013, to give a speech supporting his health care law amid a troubled website rollout, he chose the location carefully: Massachusetts was the state that enacted a universal health care law that Obama’s own proposal was based on. So it was natural that elected officials and pundits would begin to compare the Massachusetts plan with Obamacare. For the Nov. 3 edition of NBC’s Meet the Press, host David Gregory invited Mitt Romney -- the former Republican governor who enacted the law and the 2012 presidential nominee -- to discuss the laws. Gregory noted that in 2007, when Romney was making his first presidential bid, he encouraged other states to consider the Massachusetts model, even though in the 2012 race, Romney became -- like most others in his party -- a fierce critic of Obama’s law, which was passed in 2010. Romney said the two laws are not identical, and he added that he still believes that states should be able to choose the approach that fits their circumstances. Some will like the Massachusetts approach, and some won’t, he said. The Massachusetts approach ""teaches some important lessons some states are not going to want to follow,"" Romney said. ""One lesson is health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country. Now, that’s something that Texas and Minnesota and Montana are not going to necessarily want to adopt."" Is it true that health insurance is ""more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country""? There are a number of ways to measure the cost of what Romney termed ""health insurance."" For answers, we turned to research by the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation. Here are a few of the categories that would seem to fit Romney’s definition. (Note: None of the categories here include the District of Columbia.) Employer-based health insurance for individuals • Employee share: Massachusetts ranks 1st among all states. • Employer share: Massachusetts ranks 10th among all states. • Combined employee and employer share: Massachusetts ranks 2nd among all states. (Only Alaska is higher.) Employer-based health insurance for families • Employee share: Massachusetts ranks 11th among all states. • Employer share: Massachusetts ranks 5th among all states. • Combined employee and employer share: Massachusetts ranks 2nd among all states. (Only Alaska is higher.) Individual-market insurance per person • Monthly premiums: Massachusetts ranks first. So, overall, health insurance costs are indeed higher in Massachusetts than almost anywhere else. Still, it’s worth noting that while Massachusetts’ universal health care plan is likely a factor in producing high costs, it’s probably not the only factor. The state ranked second nationally in per capita personal income in 2012 (Connecticut was first), and it ranked eighth in the nation in highest cost of living. Whenever residents of a state make a lot of income and pay a lot for consumer goods generally, it’s likely to follow that health care will be relatively expensive as well. In addition, Massachusetts ranks first among states in health care expenditures per capita, and most of the rest of the top 10 consists of other relatively affluent, northeastern and mid-Atlantic states: Connecticut, Maine, Delaware, New York, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, and Pennsylvania. (The others are Alaska and North Dakota.) Our ruling Romney said, ""health insurance is more expensive in Massachusetts than anywhere else in the country."" The numbers show he’s basically correct that Massachusetts does have higher premiums than almost every other state. On some measures, though, Alaska outranks Massachusetts. The statement is accurate but needs clarification or additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C0A20C0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/03/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-health-insurance-more-expensive-m/

Chris Abele says Milwaukee is one of few communities that didn’t lose population in last census
","Among the plethora of positive points Milwaukee County Executive Chris Abele shared in a recent speech was this one: Milwaukee is on a very short list of areas that didn’t shrink in the last U.S. census. Here’s what Abele said in the Oct. 1, 2013 speech to the Rotary Club of Milwaukee: ""We’re one of the only communities in the country that didn’t lose population in the last census, the median age for which went down, and any economist will tell you that’s good news."" That is good news. If it’s accurate. To be sure, the city of Milwaukee’s population losses in recent decades have paled in comparison to some other Midwestern cities. But we were surprised by Abele’s broader population claim, which compares us with communities across the nation. Just what numbers was he using? Abele’s office first pointed us to state population trends from 2010 to 2012 showing a gain for Wisconsin. But that didn’t address his claim about Milwaukee and the country. What’s more, Abele’s state data showed that 49 states gained population from 2010 to 2012, based on the most recent estimates. So, virtually no one went down. There’s another problem: The figures he shared with us were based on annual population estimates by the Census Bureau, not the full census -- the nose count that occurs every 10 years, most recently in April 2010. Abele’s ""last census"" reference may have been to the estimates, not the actual census. But as we’ll see it doesn’t change the accuracy of his claim. Let’s look at the population numbers, starting with the last full census. Milwaukee’s population change First, we checked population figures for the city, for Milwaukee County and for the Milwaukee metro area, comparing the 2000 census with the 2010 census. City: Milwaukee lost about 2,000 people, coming in at 594,833. So, it actually shrunk a bit, by 0.4 percent. Milwaukee County: It grew by 0.8 percent, landing at 947,735. Metro area: The four-county metro region added about 55,000 people, or 3.7 percent, landing at 1,555,908. The national picture Then we examined census data on other large urban areas, again noting the change in population in the decade. Cities: Only Chicago, Detroit, Memphis and Baltimore lost ground among the 25 largest cities. In the next tier of 25, Milwaukee joined Cleveland (-17.1 percent) and Oakland (-2.2) on the downside. So the vast majority gained population, with  19 cities adding more than 10 percent. Counties: Forty-four of the top 50 most-populous counties gained population. In fact, Milwaukee County’s gain was one of the smallest on a percentage basis in that group. Metros: Forty-five of the top 50 metropolitan areas grew. The big winners included Raleigh, N.C.; Austin, Tex.; Charlotte, N.C.; Las Vegas, Nev.; Orlando, Fla.; Riverside-San Bernardino, Calif.; and Phoenix, Ariz. It’s clear from the data that most urban areas grew or at least held steady, contrary to Abele’s claim. And the modest growth in the Milwaukee metro region, though rivaling the Los Angeles and New York City areas, was at the very low end among large urban areas. A Census Bureau report on the 2000-2010 trend among some 900 metro and ""micro areas"" confirmed that growth was widespread, though slower than in the 1990s. A ""micro area"" contains an urban core of at least 10,000 but less than 50,000 people, according to the federal definition. ""Population growth of at least twice the national rate occurred in many metro and micro areas, such as some areas in parts of California, Nevada, Arizona, Texas, Florida, and the Carolinas. No metro area in the West region declined,"" the 2010 Census report said. Among counties, the report said, ""the counties that lost population were mostly regionally clustered and mirrored decades of population loss for those areas."" For example, there were population declines in many Appalachian counties in eastern Kentucky and West Virginia; many Great Plains counties in the Dakotas, Kansas, Nebraska, and Texas; and a group of counties in and around the Mississippi Delta. Notably, the report found that ""many counties along the Great Lakes and on the northern U.S. border either lost population or grew below 10 percent."" After we completed our fact check, Abele’s office got back to us again. This time, we were told Abele had been referring specifically to the city of Milwaukee, and the small estimated gain it made between the 2010 census and 2012. It’s true that annual census estimates since the full 2010 census show the city of Milwaukee growing slightly, by about 2,000 people. But gains in that two-year post-census period were common, even among cities that saw declines from 2000 to 2010, based on media reports and the Census Bureau estimates released for 2011 and 2012. In 2011, for example, the Census Bureau noted that ""overall, the population in cities grew by 1.0 percent across the nation between 2010 and 2011. However, large cities (285) tended to grow faster than the national rate at 1.3 percent."" Abele spokesman Brendan Conway conceded his boss would have been more accurate had he referred specifically to the Great Lakes Area cities and population growth. Our rating Abele contended that ""We’re one of the only communities in the country that didn’t lose population in the last census."" However you cut it, he’s way off base. This claim, given that fast growth in certain regions of the U.S. is well-established and well-known, ventures into ridiculous territory.

R.I. General Treasurer Gina Raimondo says Providence invests more of its pension money in hedge funds than the state does
","Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo has come under fire because, on her recommendation, the State Investment Commission, in 2012, put more pension money in hedge funds. Critics say the funds, which are designed to retain value or increase in value for large investors when the overall market is performing poorly, are risky and charge exorbitant rates. On Oct. 21, after a report commissioned by the largest state employees union accused Raimondo of selling out Rhode Island's public workers and retirees for an ""opportunity to enrich herself and her hedge fund backers,"" Raimondo sent out a fundraising letter trying to put the investment strategy in perspective. One portion focused on Providence's pension fund, overseen by Mayor Angel Taveras, a declared candidate for governor who is expected to face Raimondo in a Democratic primary. ""Providence has more of its pension fund invested in hedge funds and is less transparent – and yet isn’t included in the [union-financed] report because this is about attacking one individual and a comprehensive reform,"" she said. We wondered whether her points about hedge funds and transparency were accurate. Looking at how much each fund is investing in hedge funds, the most recent monthly numbers show that, as of Sept. 30, Raimondo is correct on a percentage basis. The report, available on the treasurer's website, says 14.2 percent of Rhode Island’s $7.8 billion retirement account is invested in hedge funds. In Providence, hedge funds on Sept. 30 made up 16.6 percent of the $241 million in Providence's retirement account, according to a city report. That's nearly two and a half percentage points higher than the state’s ratio. However, when Providence made part of its annual required pension contribution nine days later, that percentage dropped to about 14.3 percent, virtually identical to the state ratio. (The value of the hedge funds hadn’t declined, only their percentage of the overall fund.  When the city made the rest of its annual contribution, the ratio dropped to 13.2 percent, according to city spokesman David Ortiz, who noted that Taveras is trying to move away from hedge funds while Raimondo has embraced them.) So whether Raimondo is correct or not depends on when you look. Raimondo's office said her fundraising letter was based on a May 8, 2013, blog post at WPRI.com, which reported that Providence had just under 20 percent of its pension money invested in hedge funds at a time when the state's ratio was 14.6 percent. ""The media report from May 2013 was the only information that we could publicly find regarding Providence’s investment allocation to hedge funds,"" said Collin Berglund, spokesman for Friends of Gina Raimondo. That has changed. After Raimondo made her comment and PolitiFact called Providence to check it on Oct. 23, the city posted more of its retirement fund data online, including the Sept. 30 numbers and an Oct. 22 tally that included the $33 million infusion of cash from the city that made hedge funds an even smaller slice of the retirement pie. Which brings us to the issue of transparency. Raimondo's office has bragged about its openness because detailed information about the investments is posted on the general treasurer's website. Raimondo has also, for the first time, included information on the hidden fees that some funds charge the state and most states don't report. City spokesman Ortiz responded in an Oct. 24 email: ""Reports prepared by our pension investment advisers have always been provided to the media without any redaction, and are now publicly available on the city’s open data portal: https://data.providenceri.gov/."" He said that Raimondo has denied public records requests and redacted ""key data"" regarding fees and performance for some investments. He did not respond when we pressed him for specifics. But earlier this year, Raimondo’s office denied a request by The Providence Journal to see certain details that each hedge fund gives to the state, saying it is bound by contractual confidentiality agreements. An Aug. 4, 2013 Journal story reported that much of that information was redacted from documents Raimondo’s office provided to the newspaper. When we asked Raimondo's office about Ortiz's allegations about disclosure, spokeswoman Joy Fox said in the few instances where information has been withheld, it had to be kept secret to avoid violating contracts. We found some hedge fund report information on the Providence website that seemed to offer more detail than what Raimondo offered, but it's not clear whether the report was available before PolitiFact began inquiring about Raimondo's claim about openness. Our ruling Rhode Island General Treasurer Gina Raimondo said Providence has more of its pension fund invested in hedge funds than the state does and is less transparent about it. Based on the Sept. 30 financial statements, the first part of Raimondo's statement would have been true. The city had 16.6 percent of its pension money in hedge funds, compared with the state’s 14.2 percent. That's no longer true because Providence subsequently made its annual pension payment, increasing the proportion of non-hedge fund investments. But that information was not public at the time Raimondo made her statement. On the issue of disclosure, the city has released pension information when asked, but there’s much more pension information -- particularly historical information -- widely available to the public on the state’s website. Raimondo’s statement was accurate on Sept. 30, but recognizing that a key element had changed by the time she made it on Oct. 21, we rate it Mostly True.

Aquarium referendum means no more money for neighborhoods, flier claims
","On Tuesday, Clearwater voters will decide whether the city charter should be amended to allow officials to begin negotiations with the nonprofit Clearwater Marine Aquarium for a lease of city-owned property downtown where a $160.5 million aquarium could eventually be built.

Supporters and opponents have filled mail boxes with rival fliers touting the benefits or risks of the idea.

One recent flier paid for by the Friends of Clearwater political action committee, which opposes the aquarium idea, lists eight reasons to vote no.

One particular reason in the list caught our eye: ""NO future funding for our neighborhoods.""

PolitiFact Florida decided to fact-check the claim that if the referendum passes, there will be no future funding for Clearwater neighborhoods.

Officials we spoke with said the statement is false, and even opponents admit it is based on speculation.

""That’s just a bizarre statement,"" said Howard Warshauer, a longtime activist and vice president of the Clearwater Neighborhoods Coalition. Warshauer opposes the aquarium plan, but said the mailer’s cut-and-dried claim is inaccurate.

""Obviously, the city will go on funding neighborhoods,"" he said.

Clearwater Marine Aquarium officials have said they intend to ask for city funds from two sources if the plan to build the aquarium advances: the city parking fund and a portion of taxes raised in the downtown Community Redevelopment Area.

The city parking fund isn’t typically used for neighborhood projects, which are things such as parks, recreation facilities, traffic calming and community policing. The city uses the parking fund for parking projects and Clearwater Beach lifeguards. The city is planning to use parking fund money to build a downtown parking garage — a project which presumably would benefit the downtown neighborhood.

What about the aquarium’s potential use of property taxes raised in the downtown CRA? Would that mean ""No future funding for our neighborhoods""?

The money the aquarium wants would come from the annual tax increment raised in the district. The tax increment is new tax revenue collected if property values rise after the date the district is established. This year, that was $1.7 million in the downtown Clearwater district.

CMA plans to ask the city for half of that increment revenue for 20 years, but would need the agreement of city and county officials.

By state law, that money can’t be spent outside the boundaries of the district, which are roughly Drew Street on the north, the waterfront to the west, Chestnut Street to the south and Highland Avenue to the east. So Countryside, Island Estates, Sand Key, Morningside Estates or any other neighborhood outside the district wouldn’t be eligible for that money anyway.

But Warshauer says a broader argument about the proposed aquarium’s financial impact on neighborhoods has some validity.

""There is an unknown factor here. How much money is going to be spent on traffic impact if this aquarium is built and if it is successful?"" Warshauer said.

CMA officials contend that a successful aquarium will increase property values downtown, therefore pouring more tax increment revenue into city coffers and helping to pay for any infrastructure improvements downtown necessitated by a successful tourist attraction.

Tina Wilson, the city’s budget director, said the city has $1.8 million budgeted for street resurfacing citywide. If streets needed to be improved because so many people were drawn to the aquarium, the costs could be paid for out of the resurfacing fund, any available tax increment revenue, or a variety of other funds, including reserves, the Penny for Pinellas sales tax or the general fund. But the city hasn’t discussed options yet, Wilson said.

No one, including referendum opponents, has a crystal ball to predict what the city will spend in future years for neighborhood projects or for downtown improvements.

But since the aquarium plan is to seek only half of the increment revenue, and only for 20 years, the remaining half of that revenue would theoretically remain available for projects benefitting the downtown neighborhood.

And use of those dollars downtown wouldn’t hurt other neighborhoods in the city, since those dollars can’t legally be spent elsewhere.

There is no proof that approval of Tuesday’s referendum — which would only authorize the city to negotiate a lease and doesn’t ensure construction of the aquarium — will mean no future funding for Clearwater neighborhoods. The opponents’ statement is based on speculation, with no foundation in fact.

We rate it False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280974A3F40>],/factchecks/2013/nov/02/friends-clearwater-pac/aquarium-referendum-means-no-more-money-neighborho/
"['Georgia', 'Candidate Biography', 'Matt Rinker']","
Flier takes issue with councilwoman's record
","Atlanta residents are finding their mailboxes flooded with fliers from politicians vying for the City Council, the school board and the mayor’s office. One flier attacking the record of a veteran city councilwoman gained our attention. ""Natalyn Archibong skipped City Council meetings or was late 90% of the time,"" Matt Rinker’s flier says. ""Then She Voted Herself a Pay Raise,"" the flier says in red letters. PolitiFact Georgia wondered about the accuracy of the flier, particularly the part about Archibong voting herself a pay raise. In 2012, Archibong was one of four council members who voted against a pay raise that still passed by a 10-4 margin. Archibong represents the District 5 seat on the council, which includes several east Atlanta neighborhoods located in Fulton and DeKalb counties. An attorney in private practice, Archibong was first elected in 2001 and is hoping to be re-elected to a fourth four-year term. The District 5 council race has become particularly nasty in its final days, with accusations flying back and forth among the four candidates. On Thursday, Archibong filed a lawsuit in DeKalb County against Rinker and candidate Christian Enterkin, accusing them of slander. Enterkin also claimed in a flier that Archibong was late or absent to council meetings 90 percent of the time in 2011 and 2012. Enterkin’s flier did not mention Rinker’s claim that Archibong voted herself a pay raise. DeKalb County Superior Court Judge Gregory Adams denied Archibong’s motion for a temporary restraining order of statements about the councilwoman’s attendance record and other claims about her. The city convenes a panel of citizens once every four years to review the salaries of the mayor and the council. In 2004, the panel met and proposed raising the council’s pay from about $32,000 to $39,473. In March 2005, the council voted by a 9-3 margin to approve the pay raise. Archibong supported the salary increase and voted in favor of it. Rinker said via email he was referring to the 2005 vote. The 2012 vote raised the salaries of council members from $39,473 to $60,000 and takes effect in 2014. Archibong also sent PolitiFact Georgia attendance records that were certified by the city clerk’s office. Those records show Archibong has missed just one council meeting this year and two meetings per year in 2011 and 2012. They show she didn’t miss any council meetings in 2009 and 2010. Council records, though, raised some questions about Archibong’s punctuality. Our review of City Council meeting minutes since the beginning of 2010 shows Archibong was either absent or not listed as present when the meeting convened about 75 percent of the time. In most cases, Archibong’s arrival time was listed about one hour after the meeting was convened. The news website East Atlanta Patch published a spreadsheet that concluded Archibong was either absent or late 78.6 percent of the time during the same time frame. The council often hands out proclamations to citizens and visiting dignitaries at the beginning of meetings and then allows time for public comments before voting on legislation that is on its agenda. It is often 30 minutes to one hour before the council actually gets to the agenda. Most council members sit through the proclamations and public comments. Others, instead, hold sidebar conversations with their colleagues or administration officials or conduct other activities. ""I don't sit through proclamations,"" Archibong told us. ""I'm at work though, because the Committee on Council precedes the full council meeting."" The Committee on Council is a semimonthly gathering of select council members who discuss council administrative issues. The committee typically meets less than two hours before council meetings. Was Archibong around when the council took its first vote of the day? She was nearly every time, council records show. So, what does this mean about the accuracy of Rinker’s flier? He’s right that Archibong voted to increase her pay, but that was eight years ago. The councilwoman voted against a pay raise in 2012. This makes Rinker’s flier confusing, if not misleading. As for her attendance record, Rinker’s number comes close to our count concerning how often Archibong is either absent or was not present when the council convened. Council records show Archibong is usually present when the council makes its first vote of the day. Rinker’s claim contains some elements of truth, but there is a lot of context that needs to be considered before fully understanding what he put in the flier. On our rating scale, this one gets a Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096EE4280>],/factchecks/2013/nov/02/matt-rinker/flier-takes-issue-councilwomans-record/

Rachel Maddow says Rand Paul's 'Gattaca' speech 'was totally ripped off of Wikipedia'
","There’s no love lost between Rachel Maddow and Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky. The MSNBC host for years has criticized the rising Republican star and libertarian during her evening talk show. So when Maddow went on a rant about a recent stump speech Paul gave on behalf of Virginia Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Cuccinelli, at first it seemed like business as usual. During remarks Oct. 28 at Liberty University, Paul ventured into a diatribe against eugenics -- a sensitive topic in Virginia, where until 1979 it was legal to sterilize the mentally disabled -- when he brought up the 1997 sci-fi thriller Gattaca, starring Ethan Hawke, Uma Thurman and Jude Law. It’s at that point Maddow said he got into trouble, claiming Paul’s comments about the movie were ""totally ripped off of Wikipedia."" ""Rand Paul wants to be president,"" she added. ""But right now he’s just lifting whole sections of this Wikipedia entry hoping that nobody’s going to notice and he can call it his speech."" It’s not the first time a politician has been accused of (ahem) borrowing his words from someone else. But from Wikipedia? It seemed too sophomoric a slipup for someone like Paul, who filibustered for 13 hours straight on the Senate floor earlier this year without any accusations of lifting his remarks. It’s true the campaign trail isn’t the classroom, where copying and pasting from secondary sources is a fatal sin. But Paul is a major political player in Washington, and is considering a run for president in 2016. So a bold accusation like Maddow’s raised our eyebrow. Paul shrugged it off as a phony controversy ignited by Maddow, who he said has been ""spreading hate on me for about three years now."" ""This is really about information and attacks coming from haters,"" Paul said. We’re more than familiar with the ""haters gonna hate"" defense, just as we fact-checkers know what it’s like to be on the receiving end of Maddow’s scorn. But it was a serious enough claim that we decided to check it out anyway. What Wikipedia says We wanted to review the Gattaca Wikipedia page for ourselves. Any of the site’s users can edit entries as they see fit, meaning pages’ content changes frequently. But the pages’ edit histories are public, too, making it clear who added or changed which information and when. At first, we thought it might be possible that a reader edited the movie’s Wikipedia entry to match Paul’s speech after-the-fact. However, the history shows no change to the page between Sept. 25 and Oct. 29, the day after he stumped for Cuccinelli. Let’s check several examples of Paul’s words against the Sept. 25 version of the page: ""In the not-too-distant future, eugenics is common and DNA plays a primary role in determining your social class."" The Wikipedia entry reads, ""In ‘the not-too-distant future’, liberal eugenics is common and DNA plays the primary role in determining social class."" That looks nearly identical. ""Due to frequent screenings, Vincent faces genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way to achieve his dream of becoming an astronaut, is he has to become what’s called a ‘borrowed ladder.’ "" Wikipedia: ""Due to frequent screening, Vincent faces genetic discrimination and prejudice. The only way he can achieve his dream of becoming an astronaut is to become a ‘borrowed ladder’, a person who impersonates a ‘valid’ with a superior genetic profile."" That too is mostly identical, with a brief addition at the end. ""He assumes the identity of Jerome Morrow, a world-class swimming star with a genetic profile said to be ‘secondary to none’ but he’s been paralyzed in a car accident."" Wikipedia:  ""He assumes the identity of Jerome Eugene Morrow, a former swimming star with a genetic profile ‘second to none’, who had been injured in a car accident, leaving him paralyzed from the waist down."" Some of the wording here is different, but the sentence structure is strikingly identical. ""Jerome buys his identity -- uses his DNA, his blood, his hair, his tissue, his urine -- to pass the screenings."" Wikipedia: ""Vincent ‘buys’ Jerome's identity and uses his 'valid' DNA in blood, hair, tissue, and urine samples to pass screening."" Almost identical, but Paul mixed up the character names. Sensing a pattern? So are we. Paul was adamant there was no wrongdoing. Speaking on Oct. 30 to Fusion, a news and pop culture network aimed at young Hispanics, Paul insisted ""nothing we said was not given attribution to where it came from"" and the matter was a ""disagreement on how you footnote things."" ""We borrowed the plot lines from Gattaca. It’s a movie,"" Paul told Fusion. ""I gave credit to the people who wrote the movie."" In a statement to PolitiFact on Nov. 1, his office added: ""While Sen. Paul doesn’t believe that this is the normal standard for speeches, going forward he will be more cautious in presenting and attributing sources."" Experts weigh in Paul’s excuse doesn’t hold water, said Bob Lehrman, author of The Political Speechwriter’s Companion and a former speechwriter for Vice President Al Gore. ""When I looked at the size of language and how closely he took it, I thought that was really inappropriate, and his defense of it shows he’s either desperate to shield something or he doesn’t understand plagiarism,"" he said. Lehrman, who also teaches a speech writing class at American University, says he tells his students lifting ""even one distinctive phrase or sentence is plagiarism and is grounds for turning you in. It is absolutely inappropropriate."" It’s happened before. Then-Sen. Barack Obama was campaigning for president in 2008 when he was caught using a line uttered previously by Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. It turned out to be a blip in the race. ""People do it,"" Lehrman said. ""That doesn’t mean it’s the right thing, and it’s not the right thing to take language and just use it in a speech without attributing it."" Paul’s speech is a more serious offense than that of Obama’s 2008 gaffe, said Jonathan Bailey, the creator of Plagiarism Today, an online resource for writers to combat plagiarism. Obama forgot an attribution, one he remembered several other times, and acknowledged the error. ""What gets me is not so much what happened,"" Bailey said. ""What happened by itself is fairly mundane. All Paul had to do was apologize."" But Paul claiming he credited the movie exacerbated his problem, since the movie itself wasn’t what he lifted from. ""A little transparency, a little openness about what happened and why it’s not going to happen again would also go a long way,"" he said. Our ruling We’ll leave it to the prognosticators to determine how much impact Paul’s blunder will have on his political prospects, but the facts are pretty clear on this one. Maddow was dead on; Paul recited Gattaca’s Wikipedia page nearly word-for-word.

Suzanne Somers says even with Obamacare, tens of millions will remain uninsured
","The actress Suzanne Somers, best known for her role on the 1970s sitcom Three’s Company, sparked controversy recently when she wrote a column for the Wall Street Journal that harshly criticized President Barack Obama’s health care law. In her column, topped by the provocative title, ""The Affordable Care Act Is a Socialist Ponzi Scheme,"" Somers argued that ""the word ‘affordable’ is a misnomer. So far, all you are hearing on the news is how everyone’s premiums are doubling and tripling and it doesn’t take a rocket scientist to recognize that the whole thing is a big mess. Plus, even after Obamacare is fully implemented, there still will be tens of millions of people not covered. So what’s the point? Medical care will be degraded, the costs will skyrocket, and most frightening of all, your most intimate and personal information is now up for grabs."" The column prompted a backlash, as critics took issue with the substance of her arguments while also snickering at the Journal’s need to append multiple corrections to the column. (The correction called a quotation Somers had attributed to V.I. Lenin ""widely disputed,"" a quotation attributed to Winston Churchill unconfirmed, said Somers had misstated the type of animal used on a cover of Maclean’s magazine in 2008 -- it was a dog, not a horse.) ""In fewer than 600 words, Somers managed to purvey untruths, misinterpretations, made-up quotes and irrelevant anecdotes,"" said one particularly stinging response by the Los Angeles Times’ Robin Abcarian. But it turns out that not everything Somers said is wrong. Here we’ll take a look at her claim that ""even after Obamacare is fully implemented, there still will be tens of millions of people not covered."" We can’t predict the future, but we can turn to the best available independent analysis of the health care law’s impact -- projections from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. The CBO’s most recent projections, from February 2013, produced the following figures:   Year Number of non-elderly people without insurance Percentage of the population without insurance 2013 55 million 20% 2014 44 million 16% 2015 37 million 14% 2016 31 million 11% 2017 29 million 10% 2018 29 million 10% 2019 29 million 10% 2020 29 million 10% 2021 29 million 10% 2022 29 million 10% 2023 30 million 10%   So, Somers is right -- by 2023, there will still be 30 million Americans without insurance. Presumably these will be a combination of people who opt to pay a penalty rather than signing up for insurance, people or families who are exempted because they can’t find affordable coverage, and undocumented immigrants, who are exempt from the mandate to purchase insurance. Obamacare supporters will surely counter that the number of uninsured Americans will drop over this decade-long period by 25 million people, or almost half, despite overall population growth. In addition, the percentage of uninsured Americans will be cut in half, from 20 percent today to 10 percent a decade from now, according to CBO. Our ruling Somers wrote that, ""even after Obamacare is fully implemented, there still will be tens of millions of people not covered."" She’s right -- by 2023, CBO projects that 30 million Americans will lack health insurance. While this is lower than today’s figure both in absolute numbers and in the percentage of the population, that doesn’t take away from the basic accuracy of Somers’ claim. We rate her claim True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A448F80>],/factchecks/2013/nov/01/suzanne-somers/suzanne-somers-says-even-obamacare-tens-millions-w/

","Just hours after Democrat Alex Sink announced her run for the congressional seat left vacant after C.W. Bill Young’s death, the Republican Party of Florida started a full-court press attack. The Florida GOP posted a YouTube video criticizing Sink on a host of issues, presumably attacks they pulled from their arsenal when she ran against Rick Scott for governor in 2010. ""As Florida’s CFO, Alex Sink failed Florida taxpayers by using the state plane as her own personal charter, overseeing a $27 billion loss in the state’s pension fund and supporting a $5.2 billion increase in Florida’s debt,"" the video’s text reads. We’ll examine other claims from the ad during the race, but in this fact-check we’ll focus on looking into Sink’s tie to the state pension fund. Is it accurate to say she oversaw $27 billion in losses? As the state’s chief financial officer, Sink’s responsibilities included accounting, auditing and managing Florida’s finances. She also served on the State Board Administration of Florida, the office that oversees the pension fund. In their Feburary 2013 report, the SBA put the value of pension assets at $132 billion. In 2007, the year Sink took office, the pension was worth $136.3 billion, according to the SBA. In 2010, her last year as CFO, that value was down to $109.3 billion. That makes the net loss $27 billion, as the ad said. This claim echoes those made by the party when Sink ran for governor against Republican Rick Scott. As we’ve noted before, there are several important caveats to this claim. The action of comparing how much the pension is worth at different points in history is not as devastating as it might sound. There’s no permanent loss in value until the assets are sold. Although the pension was temporarily worth less in 2010 than in 2007, the money isn’t gone by any means. When the nation started recovering from the recession a couple of years ago, the Florida pension followed suit. ""The pension fund is in pretty good shape right now,"" said Kurt Wenner, vice president for tax research at Florida TaxWatch, a business-backed institute focused on tax issues. ""It certainly wasn’t a critical situation."" Besides the figures not being permanent, the implication that Sink, as CFO, is to blame for the loss in value is also misleading. Three SBA trustees jointly oversee the pension fund: the governor, the attorney general and the CFO. There’s nothing that suggests Sink’s responsibilities should be singled out above those of either former Gov. Charlie Crist  or former Attorney General Bill McCollum (who were both Republicans at the time, by the way). Our ruling The Republican Party of Florida said there was a loss of pension assets of $27 billion during Sink’s term as the state’s CFO. But that doesn’t represent a permanent loss of funds. We also see no reason why Sink deserves more of the blame than the other two trustees. And, Sink was CFO during a historic recession. Given these sizeable caveats, we rate the Florida GOP’s claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097092080>],/factchecks/2013/nov/01/republican-party-florida/florida-gop-says-alex-sink-oversaw-27b-loss-pensio/
"['New Hampshire', 'Debt', 'Kelly  Ayotte']","
Ayotte counts the amount of debt accrued by Presidents Bush, Obama
","During a swing through New Hampshire in October 2013, Sen. Kelly Ayotte, R-N.H., hammered home her concern about the country’s growing national debt. When she met with about 60 people at a town hall forum in Hudson, N.H., Ayotte stood beside a national debt counter projected onto a screen. It ticked away each new dollar added to the country’s debts, which recently topped $17 trillion. Ayotte said both parties bear responsibility, and that the debt can only be addressed through bipartisan cooperation. ""It took two parties to get us into debt. It’s going to take two parties to get us out of debt,"" she said. ""Under President (George W. Bush), we added $4.9 trillion to the debt. Under President Obama, since he’s been in office, we’ve added $6.5 trillion to the debt,"" she said. ""I think all of us sort of on a gut basis understand why the $17 trillion debt is bad for the country, because at home, if we didn’t pay our bills, eventually we get to a point where if our bills end up being more than we’re taking in, we go bankrupt."" Throughout his first term, Obama was saddled with criticism that deficit spending has ballooned under his watch. PolitiFact has checked a variety of these claims in the past, but with Ayotte again drawing attention to the national debt, we thought it would be useful to take another look. It’s somewhat tricky to calculate how much money Obama is responsible for adding to the national debt. The point at which Obama starts to bear responsibility for debt increases is a matter of dispute. Normally, presidents inherit budget policies from their predecessors, but because Obama took office during an economic free-fall, several big-ticket budgetary items, including the Troubled Asset Relief Program, could plausibly be ascribed to a combination of the two presidents. (See a full discussion here and here.) However, the simplest way to analyze Ayotte’s claim is to look at the size of the debt on the day Obama took office -- January 20, 2009 -- and compare it to the debt level today. This is what Ayotte was getting at when she cited the increase in the national debt ""since he’s been in office."" Another challenge in assessing Ayotte’s claim is the fact that there are at least two ways to measure the national debt. ""Public debt"" is one measurement commonly used by the U.S. Department of Treasury. It includes all debt borrowed by the federal government and held by investors through Treasury notes and other securities. Another commonly cited figure is the country’s total debt, or gross federal debt. This number is higher. It includes public debt plus government debts, such as the money borrowed from the Social Security and Medicare trust funds to fund government operations, which are effectively government IOUs to itself. Here, the context in which Ayotte made her claim is helpful in determining whether she was referring to public debt or total debt. Before discussing Obama, Ayotte said that former president Bush added $4.9 trillion to the national debt during his time in office. Bush did in fact increase the national debt by $4.9 trillion if you measure by total debt, or gross federal debt. For this reason, we’ll assume Ayotte was also speaking about total debt when she discussed the $6.5 trillion increase under Obama. Crunching the numbers On Jan. 20, 2009, the date of Obama's inauguration, the debt held by the public stood at roughly $6.307 trillion, according to the Treasury Department’s ""Debt to the Penny"" calculator. The total debt, or gross federal debt, was about $10.627 trillion. Next, we need to calculate how much the debt increased as of Oct. 24, 2013 -- the date Ayotte made her remark in Hudson. By that date, the debt held by the public was about $12.122 trillion and total debt had climbed to nearly $17.1 trillion. So, since Obama took office, debt held by the public increased by about $5.815 trillion, and total debt increased by about $6.451 trillion. So she was right on the money. Ayotte overstated the increase by about $49 billion, which is a lot of money, but it’s a tiny fraction of the country’s multi-trillion dollar debt. One final note: On claims where a speaker takes credit or assigns blame for a statistic, we usually take a two-part approach to rating the claim’s accuracy. Is the number right? And is the credit or blame correctly assigned? In this case, Obama doesn’t deserve full ""blame"" for the debt growth on his watch, since about two-thirds of the annual deficit during his term has been from entitlements and interest. Entitlements, such as Social Security and Medicare, are less susceptible to a president’s policy preferences than discretionary spending that Congress must approve on an annual basis. Entitlements are also more heavily driven by demographic factors, such as the aging of the population, which is also out of any president’s control. Meanwhile, a sizable share of the interest being paid today is paying off debts accumulated under previous presidents. That said, we’re not going to dock Ayotte for how she assigned blame, because her claim was carefully evenhanded. Even as she applied ""blame"" to Obama, she said the same applied to Bush. Her statement that ""it took two parties to get us into debt. It’s going to take two parties to get us out of debt"" is distinctly bipartisan in tone. Our ruling Ayotte said that the country has added $6.5 trillion to the national debt since Obama took office and $4.9 trillion under Bush. When measuring by total debt, she’s correct on both counts. We rate her claim True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F88CC0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/01/kelly-ayotte/ayotte-counts-amount-debt-accrued-presidents-bush-/

Cuccinelli says McAuliffe wants to raise average family taxes by $1,700
","Republican Ken Cuccinelli is closing his gubernatorial campaign with warnings to Virginia families about the price they’ll pay if Democrat Terry McAuliffe wins Tuesday’s election. ""Terry also wants to raise your taxes $1,700 to pay for his infinite promises,"" Cuccinelli said during the final gubernatorial debate on Oct. 24. He’s makes the same claim on a number of ads, including a TV spot released on Oct. 29 that says, ""Terry McAuliffe’s plan: expand Obamacare, increase spending, raise your taxes by $1,700."" The tax charge originates from Cuccinelli’s estimate of the fiscal impact of various promises he says McAuliffe has made. Let’s look at how the Republican arrived at that number. Cuccinelli says the McAuliffe’s pledges add up to $14 billion in new spending over the next four years. About $12 billion of that sum stems from statements McAuliffe has made on three issues: public school funding, college debt and public teacher pay. On K-12 education, Cuccinelli points to a section on page 11 of McAuliffe’s platform where the Democrat laments cuts to school funding that the state made during the Great Recession and has not fully restored. ""It’s time to restore those standards and make sure our schools have the tools they need to get the job done,"" McAuliffe’s platform says. Cuccinelli interprets that statement as a McAuliffe pledge to fully restore education money at the start of his administration. The Republican cites research by The Commonwealth Institute, a liberal think tank, which found that in inflation-adjusted numbers, the per-pupil general fund spending for K-12 students was about $5,000 during the 2007-08 school year  fiscal year, but only about $4,000 this school year. With enrollment data from the Virginia Department of Education showing about 1.2 million K-12 students in 2012-13, Cuccinelli estimates that restoring per-pupil funding to 2007 levels would cost more than $1.2 billion annually, or $5 billion over a four-year McAuliffe term. The second biggest expense, Cuccinelli says, would come from what he interprets to be McAuliffe’s position on college debts assumed by Virginia undergraduates. Page 12 of McAuliffe’s platform says, ""Every student deserves the opportunity to get a quality education and start their working lives without the burden of debt."" Cuccinelli says that means McAuliffe is vowing to clear all Virginia students’ debts. Using figures from the Institute for College Access, which estimated that 2011 college graduates receiving a bachelor’s degree in Virginia had an average debt of $14,628, Cuccinelli estimated it would cost $667 million to pay off the loans of the entire class. Once rising enrollments and debt loads are taken into account,  Cuccinelli says the total cost of this policy would be nearly $3.9 billion over the next four years. Cuccinelli also says McAuliffe has vowed to raise teacher pay in Virginia to the national average. He points to a May 25 speech in Manassas in which McAuliffe said, ""as governor, I want to make sure that we pay our teachers the national average in order for us to get the best possible teachers."" Cuccinelli took figures from the National Education Association showing there are 103,908 teachers in Virginia. During the 2011-2012 school year, Virginia instructors earned an average of $48,703. That was $6,715 below the national average of $55,418. Cuccinelli estimates it would cost about $700 million a year -- or $2.8 billion over four years -- to end the disparity. To compute the tax cost per family, Anna Nix, a Cuccinelli spokeswoman, says the campaign divided its estimated four-year, $14 billion cost of McAuliffe’s full agenda by four, which comes to $3.5 billion annually. Cuccinelli’s camp divided that yearly cost by the state’s population of 8.2 million and arrived at an estimate of $427 per person. So an average  four-person family would pay slightly more than $1,700, Nix reasons. Josh Schwerin, a McAuliffe spokesman, dismisses Cuccinelli’s calculations, saying his campaign ""is just making up numbers."" ""Terry has no plans to raise taxes,"" Schwerin said in an e-mail. He also denied that McAuliffe has made any of the three major promises Cuccinelli attributes to him. He said that McAuliffe’s comments on restoring public school funding, raising teacher salaries to the national average and easing college students’ debts merely reflect his boss’s ""spending priorities."" ""It would be irresponsible to say how much you’re going to spend before knowing how much revenue there will be,"" Schwerin wrote. Cuccinelli’s $1,700-a-year tax estimate assumes McAuliffe will accomplish all of his policy ambitions during his first months in office without reducing any governmental expenses. McAuliffe has pledged to ""save millions of taxpayers dollars through operational efficiencies,"" but his plan is not greatly detailed. He’s broadly called for reducing government energy costs, cutting state employee travel expenditures and streamlining agencies. Cuccinelli’s estimate assumes there will be no increase in state revenues during a McAuliffe governorship, ignoring that general fund tax receipts have risen by an annual average of 3.7 percent over the last three years. It also assumes McAuliffe will fail to convince the General Assembly to expand Virginia’s Medicaid program to reap federal dollars available under Obamacare. There may be good reason for Cuccinelli’s hunch: the Republican-led House is staunchly opposed to the enlargement. McAuliffe says the expansion could produce $500 million a year in new revenues and savings, but some predict analysts predict the annual yield may only be $50 million. Cuccinelli’s tax estimate also ignores some standard practices in state budgeting. For example, it assumes that the state would pay the entire cost of raising average teacher salaries to the national average. Virginia traditionally shares the cost of increasing teachers’ pay with localities. Our ruling Cuccinelli says McAuliffe wants to raise taxes by $1,700 annually for an average four-person family to pay for his ""promises."" The major problem is that Cuccinelli’s claim is based on his own interpretation of McAuliffe’s agenda. He assumes, for example, that McAuliffe’s statement that college graduates ""deserve the opportunity"" to start their careers without the burden of student debts is a promise that the state will pay off their loans, starting his first year in office. He assumes McAuliffe’s statement that ""it’s time"" to restore per-pupil funding in public schools to pre-recession levels is a vow to do that instantly. Then, Cuccinelli takes his assumptions and multiplies them by a stew of worst-case scenarios to come up with his unreliable tax estimate. We don’t fault Cuccinelli for demanding specifics on McAuliffe’s agenda; the Democrat has addressed issues with a broad brush throughout the campaign. It’s fair to ask how McAuliffe would accomplish his objectives and keep his word not to raise taxes. But that doesn’t give Cuccinelli the license to create a platform for his rival. We rate his claim False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A413A40>],/factchecks/2013/nov/01/ken-cuccinelli/cuccinelli-says-mcauliffe-wants-raise-average-fami/

McAuliffe says Cuccinelli would use public school money to fund private education
","Democratic gubernatorial nominee Terry McAuliffe says Ken Cuccinelli, his Republican rival, is no friend to public education. ""On education, he’d take money away from public schools to fund private schools,"" the McAuliffe campaign says in a TV ad that began airing Oct. 16. The claim -- according to Josh Schwerin, a McAuliffe spokesman -- centers on Cuccinelli’s plan to empower parents whose children attend what the state deems to be a failing school. Under the proposal, a majority of parents could vote to change the leadership of such a school, close it, transform it to a charter school, or put their children in their choice of public or private schools. Cuccinelli would have the state compensate parents for additional costs they incurred by changing their child’s school. He would establish a scholarship fund for children who switched public schools. And he would seek legislation allowing Virginia to provide the parents with tax credits to defray tuition at nonsectarian, private schools. Cuccinelli also wants to offer the tax credits to failing-school parents who want to send their children to religious academies. This would require voters to approve what he called a ""narrowly drafted"" amendment to the state constitution, which bans state aid for K-12 sectarian education. Cuccinelli has not put a pricetag on the tax break. Anna Nix, a spokeswoman for the campaign, said the total cost would vary based on how many parents opt for the tax credit choice and how much it costs to educate a child in those private venues. McAuliffe's ad says the plan would force localities to raise property taxes to compensate for lost state aid to public schools.  Seeking a bottom line, we came up with our own estimate of the cost of the tax credit. Cuccinelli would define a failing school as one that was denied state accreditation because of chronically low student achievement. There are six such schools this year: three in Norfolk, two in Petersburg and one in Alexandria. According to state Department of Education figures, total enrollment at those schools was 3,335 last school year. Based on per-pupil allocations to each of the cities housing a failing school, the state spent $16.9 million educating those students. So the maximum cost of the tax credit -- assuming every student at every failing school would up being privately educated -- would be about $16.9 million this year. That’s about three-tenths of 1 percent of the nearly $5.2 billion in general funds the state will spend on public education. Nix said Cuccinelli ""will not touch education"" to pay for the tax credit. But Democrats have long argued that it’s impossible to cut income taxes without affecting the long-term money available to public schools. That’s because income taxes are the largest revenue source for the state’s general fund -- now at $17.4 billion -- which pays for education, health programs and public safety. About 30 percent of the general fund is traditionally allocated for public education. Our ruling McAuliffe says Cuccinelli would ""take away money from public schools to pay for private schools."" Cuccinelli’s K-12 plan opens that possibility by proposing tax credits for the parents of children in failing public schools to defray their cost of switching to private education. The program, if passed by the General Assembly, would have enormous symbolic meaning because it would crack Virginia’s tradition of not directly aiding private schools. McAuliffe’s statement, however, lacks perspective. It doesn’t note that Cuccinelli’s program would be very small. This year, only six of Virginia’s 1,828 public schools are failing. They are attended by 3,335 of the state’s 1.27 million students. In the unlikely scenario that every failing-school parent switched their children to private schools, Cuccinelli’s tax credit would have cost about $16.9 million this year -- one-third of 1 percent of the state’s public education budget. Cuccinelli says he would not cut the K-12 budget to pay for his plan. But in the long run under other governors, the revenues available to fund public education would be reduced -- very marginally -- to support the private school tax break. So there’s a sliver of accuracy to McAuliffe’s statement, but it creates a misleading impression of Cuccinelli’s education platform. We rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097096780>],/factchecks/2013/nov/01/terry-mcauliffe/mcauliffe-says-cuccinelli-would-use-public-school-/

Gov. Scott Walker cites Philadelphia Fed to say Wisconsin ranks No. 2 in economic growth
","In recent weeks, Gov. Scott Walker -- and his allies -- began emphasizing an obscure measurement  to argue that his policies were improving the state’s economy: an index created by the Federal Reserve Bank of Philadelphia. It sounds like a prestigious, important metric. But until Walker started discussing the Philly Fed report, scant attention was paid to this index of states’ economies. The report is meant to predict how the states’ economies will grow in the next six months, but  is seldom cited nationally and almost never used to compare one state with another. More on that last point later. But after the report issued Sept. 24, 2013, the Philly Fed became a talking point for Walker and his supporters, including the Wisconsin Manufacturers and Commerce, which featured it in a $1 million television ad campaign. For his part, Walker’s office highlighted the Sept. 24, 2013 report in public appearances, social media, and with a news release. The headline: ""Wisconsin ranked #2 in economic growth."" Amid concern about jobs, is Wisconsin really ranked second for economic growth? As we looked into Walker’s claim, we learned that  there’s good reason the report doesn’t receive much attention: The index varies wildly from month to month. In late spring, the index ranked Wisconsin’s economy as second worst in the nation, behind only Wyoming. How did we go from bottom of the barrel to the cream of the crop? The Philly Fed index seeks to measure state-by-state economic growth using variables such as building permits, initial unemployment insurance claims and data from a survey of manufacturers. A key component is each state’s monthly jobs report. This figure is based on reports from only about 3 percent of the state’s employers. It comes with a large margin of error, is revised in subsequent months, and ultimately replaced with more-accurate quarterly figures that come from virtually all state employers. The preliminary Philly Fed report for April  2013  showed only five states with contraction, assigning Wisconsin an index rank of -0.74 percent. Wyoming, with a rank of -1.29 percent, was the only state with a lower index. Things changed in the report issued one month later. The state’s April ranking was revised to 40th. And the new report, for May, said Wisconsin had moved up to 20th place. This volatility is identical to that seen in the monthly jobs reports. Walker’s own administration once highlighted those jobs reports as a measure of success, but now criticizes them as inaccurate. Yet the same data is used to create the Philly Fed index. State by state comparisons? The Philly Fed doesn’t provide a first-to-worst listing for the states, but it is easily created by ranking states by the percentage change in the states’ indexes from month to month. That is what Walker did in September, when he declared the August numbers showed Wisconsin ranked second. The index for Wisconsin grew 0.51 percent from July to August. The only other state that had a larger change was North Dakota, which increased 0.52 percent. Nationally, the index changed 0.23 percent in the same time frame. To be clear, the Philly Fed doesn’t do the ranking. The bank provides the monthly index and shows the change on a map. States are grouped into seven categories based on the size of the change. It’s a simple process to calculate the percentage change, and then sort them from highest to lowest. After Walker touted the number, the Philly Fed issued a statement saying that it was wrong to use its data to compare performance between states: ""We do not consider state rankings based on the coincident and leading indexes to be valid."" When we asked the governor’s office about this, they said such state-to-state comparisons were valid, and cited an unusual source: The Philly Fed itself. Walker’s staff pointed us to the part of the bank’s website that explains the indexes. it reads: ""The model and the input variables are consistent across the 50 states, so the state indexes are comparable to one another."" When we went back to the bank, spokeswoman Marilyn Wimp said they were sticking with their most recent statement -- don’t compare states -- despite what the website says. And bank spokesman Thomas Elliott directed us to a January 2013 report issued by the bank that  evaluates the effectiveness of the index. That report says the index provides a good measure of states’ economies but that state-by-state comparisons are problematic because the system doesn’t provide good measurements for states that have a lot of agriculture or mining. Here is the relevant portion: ""Since the volatility of the percent change in these indexes is relatively large compared to the average change, an individual state’s ranking based on the percent change can jump wildly from one end of a relatively narrow range to the other. Rank order is not persistent, thus state rankings are misleading."" We asked Elliott if the bank has told Walker not to make state-to-state comparisons. ""We were proactive in reaching out to those who mischaracterized our indexes,"" he responded. Our rating Walker said  the Philadelphia Federal Reserve Bank ranks Wisconsin as ""No. 2 in economic growth."" But the bank did not provide the information as a ranking and maintains it is not valid to make such state-to-state comparisons. What’s more, the number for each state is based in part on monthly employment numbers which Walker’s own administration has criticized as inaccurate. Still, the fact the bank’s own website seems to invite a comparison. We rate Walker’s statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809A2A50C0>],/factchecks/2013/nov/01/scott-walker/gov-scott-walker-cites-philadelphia-fed-say-wiscon/
"['Oregon', 'Economy', 'Julie Parrish']","
Is West Linn a national leader in number of home businesses?
","For more than a decade, economists have charted a pronounced trend toward more home-based businesses. Nationally, the number of people working from home increased by 2 million from 2005 to 2010, according to the U.S. Census. In Oregon, the city of West Linn has long claimed a relatively high number of home-based businesses, with City Council members and others routinely referring to the city as having one of the highest rates per capita in the state. Rep. Julie Parrish, R-West Linn, took things to a new level during the recent legislative special session, when she spoke on the floor to support a small-business tax cut. She said the proposed cuts would save enough for many businesses to hire an additional employee, then added, ""West Linn has one of the highest per capita rates of home-based businesses in the United States."" That caught our attention. Does West Linn’s per capita rate of home-based businesses top almost anywhere in the country? PolitiFact Oregon decided to check. We contacted Parrish by email and received a quick reply. She cited a May 2, 2013, article in the West Linn Tidings newspaper. The article, referring to U.S. Census data, stated that West Linn ranked second in Oregon in the rate of home-based businesses per capita at 8.9 percent. Only Lake Oswego, at 10.9 percent, ranked higher. Parrish offered additional figures to bolster her case. As of April, she said, 2,769 businesses with West Linn addresses were registered with the Oregon Secretary of State’s office. Further, West Linn has a population of about 25,600 and 9,779 households, according to the 2010 Census. Of those, 777 units are vacant. That leaves 2,769 businesses spread among about 9,000 households. Suitably crunched, those numbers indicate that about 28 percent of households have a registered business, Parrish said, adding, ""Of course, not all of those are going to be home-based."" From there, however, the slope got more slippery. We took Parrish up on her suggestion to contact West Linn City Councilor Thomas Frank, who, she said, had cited 2010 Census Bureau data for statewide numbers of home-based businesses in one of his recent blog posts. Frank said West Linn used to call itself Oregon’s leader when it came to the number of home-based businesses. He then cited the same figures used in the West Linn Tidings article. Asked whether West Linn had, as Parrish stated, one of the highest per capita rates in the nation, Frank said, ""I’ve not heard that one before."" Next, at Frank’s suggestion, we turned to Chris Kerr, West Linn’s economic development director. He also could not pinpoint the origin of West Linn’s reputation for having a high concentration of home-based businesses. ""I have heard similar statements about the comparatively large number/percentage of home-based businesses in West Linn,"" Kerr wrote by email. ""However, I am not familiar with any comparative data on this subject; certainly not related to the national averages or on a per capita basis."" In the end, neither he, Frank nor anyone else contacted by PolitiFact Oregon could cite numbers supporting the notion that West Linn is a leader in home-based enterprises, even though that’s been the conventional wisdom for years. Kerr said the city probably does have a beefy number of home-based businesses because of its high percentage of residential to nonresidential land. The city last year listed 1,245 licensed businesses -- far fewer than the state listed for West Linn -- of which 423 were at residences. The discrepancy underscores the difficulty of finding precise numbers. Kerr noted that some of those homes were listed for mailing-address purposes only. Other home businesses don’t bother to get licenses in hopes of avoiding regulation or licensing fees. ""I’ve been told that Southeast Portland has an unusually high number of home-based businesses, but there’s no way to prove it,"" said Eric Norberg, longtime president of the Association of Home Businesses in Portland. ""Cities don’t tabulate that separately, and many home businesses have no desire to tell anyone but their customers what they are doing."" Still, we wondered whether cities can be ranked according to their per capita rates of home-based businesses. Yes, said Jason Jurjevich, assistant director of Portland State University’s Population Research Center, but not by using full Census statistics. Instead, data along these lines come from the Economic Census, a survey of business owners conducted every five years. The problem is it’s a relatively small survey and doesn’t produce information down to cities the size of West Linn, Jurjevich said. The single source of information that could be used that way -- Public Use Microdata Sample, or PUMS -- requires population sets of at least 100,000. Of West Linn, he said: ""It’s too small."" The Census’ annual American Community Survey also gathers data from businesses and homeowners. In a question asking how many people work from home, 8.5 percent of West Linn respondents answered yes (not the 8.9 percent listed in the Tidings article). But there’s no way to determine how many are simply employees who work from home. To Parrish’s credit, she promised to continue looking for ""the specific numbers,"" adding, ""I’m willing to acknowledge that I don’t have them in hand."" She stood by saying West Linn has ""one of the highest"" per capita ratings in Oregon, despite the fact that no one could point to specific data to back that up. But back to her original claim to House colleagues that West Linn has ""one of the highest per capita rates of home-based businesses in the United States."" It’s conceivably possible that’s true, but Parrish could offer no substantiation. And we found that no such statistics exist on a city the size of West Linn. In such cases, PolitiFact rates the claim False.  ",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B92480>],/factchecks/2013/oct/31/julie-parrish/west-linn-national-leader-number-home-businesses-p/

No evidence for claim that Texas voter ID law tries to disenfranchise women and defeat Wendy Davis
","An Oct. 24, 2013, email blast from the Democratic Governors Association opened: ""BREAKING: Texas Governor Rick Perry’s voter ID law is a blatant effort to defeat Wendy Davis by disenfranchising tens of thousands of women voters."" The email, urging donations to Davis’ gubernatorial campaign, went on to say that Perry and ""his handpicked successor, Greg Abbott,"" the Republican Texas attorney general running for governor, ""are trying to undo the voting rights women fought for – a century ago! It’s downright anti-democratic."" Dramatic--and is this so? From the top, there’s a sizable timeline hiccup in the idea that the Texas voter ID law, approved by the Republican-led Legislature and signed into law by Perry in 2011, came to be in order to disenfranchise women potentially voting for Davis for governor in 2014. Davis, a Fort Worth state senator, announced her gubernatorial candidacy on Oct. 3, 2013 and wasn’t even reported to be considering a statewide bid until after her June 25, 2013 filibuster slowing GOP-led passage of a measure stepping up abortion restrictions. To our request for backup information, an association spokesman, Danny Kanner, emailed us links to a news article and commentary, both published in October 2013, and to a 2006 report by the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. The articles touched on the possibility that photo IDs presented by women at the polls might not have the same names on them as voter records. None reached conclusions about a link between the 2011 law and Davis garnering votes for governor in 2014. Under the Texas law, which had its implementation delayed to the November 2013 elections by legal challenges, voters going to the polls are expected to present a photo ID issued by the Texas Department of Public Safety (a driver's license, personal ID card, concealed handgun license or election identification certificate) or by the federal government (a passport, military ID or a citizenship or naturalization certificate). One voter's experience As noted by Kanner, on Oct. 22, 2013, KIII-TV, Channel 3 in Corpus Christi, reported that the law may cause delays at polling places when a voter’s name on their offered ID doesn’t match their name on the voter roll. The story quoted a state district judge, Sandra Watts, as saying that when she went to vote the day before, what ""I have used for voter registration and for identification for the last 52 years was not sufficient."" Watts was required to sign an affidavit affirming her identity, the story said, when a poll official noticed that she had one name shown as her middle name on her driver’s license and a different middle name on her voter registration card. One of the middle names was her maiden name. The story further noted that the alternative to signing a voter affidavit would be to vote a provisional ballot. A provisional ballot isn’t counted until seven to 10 days after an election and then only after a voter proves their eligibility. Commentator's speculation On Oct. 24, 2013, Slate legal columnist Dahlia Lithwick wrote a commentary, also noted by Kanner, about the effect of voter ID laws on turnout. She concluded there is insufficient data to reach sweeping conclusions about the effects of voter ID laws on disenfranchising women. Lithwick noted first that some see an effort to deter females aligned with Democratic candidates from casting ballots. To the contrary, Lithwick wrote, some election law experts told her such laws might deter more conservative women who might be more likely to have different names on their voter registrations and photo IDs. Brennan Center survey Kanner also pointed out a 2006 survey conducted by the Brennan Center indicating that only 48 percent of voting-age women with ready access to their birth certificates had a certificate with their current legal name. ""Many of those who possess ready documentation of their citizenship do not have documentation that reflects their current name. For example, survey results show that only 48% of voting-age women with ready access to their U.S. birth certificates have a birth certificate with current legal name – and only 66% of voting-age women with ready access to any proof of citizenship have a document with current legal name. Using 2000 census citizen voting-age population data, this means that as many as 32 million voting-age women may have available only proof of citizenship documents that do not reflect their current name."" Concern about women being blocked from voting is one thing. We looked for signs the law was written to do so, coming up empty. A press release and a news blog post On the Nexis database, we searched for news articles on the 2011 Texas law and the disenfranchisement of women. Many stories touched on Democratic charges that ID demands at the polls would deter Latino and black voters. Very little turned up focusing on the effects of the mandate on women. On March 24, 2011, blogger Charles Kuffner of Houston quoted a press release issued by Houston state Rep. Jessica Farrar, a Democrat who opposed the proposal. Issued after the House advanced the ID measure, Farrar’s release said: ""The list of citizens who could be denied the right to vote because of the new requirement is quite lengthy, and includes: the elderly, women who are recently married or divorced, college students, the poor, those who live in rural areas, Hispanics and African Americans."" Earlier, the Fort Worth Star-Telegram reported on Davis questioning the Senate’s version of the ID measure by recalling her younger years while stressing the possible effect of the law on low-income Texans. ""Long before she was a Harvard-educated attorney and a member of the state Senate, Wendy Davis was a divorced single mom who was holding down two jobs and raising a young daughter while attending Tarrant County Community College,"" the newspaper’s Dave Montgomery said in a Jan. 25, 2011, PoliTex blog post. ""Davis recalled those experiences Tuesday as the Republican-controlled state Senate debated a controversial voter ID bill. Like other Democrats, she contended that (Senate Bill) 14 threatens to disenfranchise the indigent, minorities and elderly by requiring voters to show a photo identification in order to vote,"" the post went. The blog post continued: ""‘There was a time when I was indigent,’ the Fort Worth lawmaker told Sen. Troy Fraser, R-Horseshoe Bay, as they debated the merits of the legislation. Had the law been in effect during her earlier days, Davis told Fraser, she ‘would have been quite challenged’ in acquiring the documentation needed to exercise her right to vote."" Davis cited her own experiences when was holding down two jobs and said that many low-income Texans do not have the time to leave work and stand in long lines, nor do they have the money to purchase the required ID documents, Montgomery wrote. ""For people who have to take off at work it can be a very real problem,"" Davis said as she stood beside a chart illustrating the cost of supporting documents, the blog post said. ""I'm afraid we're going to wind up disenfranchising legal citizens...who are going to be denied the right to vote."" More women might lack required ID to vote Separately, we asked activists and attorneys who have questioned the law about evidence bearing on the association’s claim. Wendy Weiser, who directs a Brennan Center project focused on voting rights and who also has been involved in litigation against the law, said by telephone that she is not aware of studies specific to the ID mandate’s effect on women alone, though she said that due to marriages and divorces, women generally change their names more often than men. Weiser suggested we consider research by Matt Barreto, a University of Washington political scientist who has conducted voter surveys to gauge how many have the IDs required to vote in states with such mandates. By email, Barreto told us that a 2009 survey of Texas registered voters indicates that at that time, 89.5 percent of male registered voters had a valid photo ID compared with 84.2 percent of women. The difference, Barreto said, was statistically significant and an indication that about 900,000 registered female voters lacked the ID likely required to vote compared with about 520,000 men. Arianna Campos, a Farrar aide, suggested we contact Sondra Haltom, president of Empower the Vote Texas, a nonprofit group that describes itself as advocating changes that encourage voter participation and opposing restrictions of voter rights. By telephone, Haltom said that by her analysis, a match of state voter rolls with driver license data, as of August 2013, nearly 610,000 registered voters had no sign of a driver’s license or state ID on their voter registration records--with 84 percent of them being women and/or minorities and/or young people. Haltom emailed us a spreadsheet indicating that by her calculation, about 402,000 of the nearly 610,000 voters, 60 percent, were women. But the state of Texas and federal judges have objected to reaching conclusions about how many people carry appropriate IDs based on such absences of matching information, a spokesman for Abbott’s state office, Jerry Strickland, pointed out by email. In August 2012, a judicial panel for the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia issued a ruling striking down the Texas ID law, though that ruling was overtaken on June 25, 2013 when the Supreme Court held that Texas and other jurisdictions no longer had to win federal preclearance of changes in voting laws before carrying them out. Regardless, the 2012 ruling said the state had failed to prove the ID law would not lead to retrogression in voting among racial minorities. That ruling also challenged the methodology behind tabulating those registration records lacking driver license numbers. The judges noted, first, that Texans seeking to register to vote are given the option of recording the last four digits of a Social Security number or their eight-digit driver’s license number, meaning ""even voters who possess a driver’s license may opt to provide a Social Security number. After all, four digits are easier to write than eight. Furthermore, many voters likely memorize their Social Security number but not their driver’s license number,"" the judges wrote. ""Thus, what voters write on their registration form is barely probative of whether they actually possess a state-issued ID card—much less whether they possess any"" of the types of photo IDs permitted under the law. State: No voters turned away to date Finally, a spokeswoman for the Texas Secretary of State’s office, Alicia Pierce, telephoned us after learning of this fact check from the attorney general’s office. Pierce stressed that the Texas law does not require anyone’s name on a valid ID to perfectly match their name on their voter registration. She said, too, that voters whose names are ""substantially"" similar had cast ballots in the 2013 ""early voting"" period by swearing that they are who they say they are. Men and women were affected to limited degrees, she said. She said she was not aware of anyone with a substantially similar name on their ID and voter registration being prevented from voting. Our ruling The Democratic governors group said the voter ID measure signed into law by Perry is a ""blatant effort to defeat Wendy Davis by disenfranchising tens of thousands of women voters."" In addition to its timeline gulf--the ID proposal passed into law two years before Davis emerged as a serious gubernatorial prospect--this claim suffers from an absence of proof that the Texas law was intended to disenfranchise tens of thousands of women or has had such an immediate effect. Significantly, we are not judging here whether the ID hurdle is affecting voter participation. The law is lately being enforced for the first time. Only after the 2013 elections is there likely to be data on its effect on voters--of all kinds. This pre-election claim, weakened by chronological illogic and an overall absence of evidence, shakes out as both incorrect and ridiculous.

"['Census', 'Race and Ethnicity', 'Florida', 'Alan Grayson']","
Florida will become majority-minority in 2014, Alan Grayson says
","U.S. Rep. Alan Grayson, D-Orlando, drew fire for comparing the tea party to the Ku Klux Klan in a fundraising email just days before the Florida Democratic Party’s big conference in Orlando.   At the conference, he continued his theme of portraying the GOP as ""bigots"" when he read a mock Republican Party conference agenda that included raising the Confederate flag. A less publicized part of his speech, though, seemed worth of a fact-check, and on a less incendiary topic: the changing demographics of Florida voters. ""We go into an election next year with something very important happening in Florida this year. This is the year that Florida becomes a majority minority state, joining New Mexico, Arizona, Texas, California and Hawaii. Why is that important? Because it tells us what our strategy as the Democratic Party will be for next year ..."" Grayson then continued to talk about how the Democratic Party represents a variety of people, including blacks and Spanish-speakers, and that the party will tap into that diversity during the 2014 election. The proportion of minorities in Florida -- particularly Hispanics -- is a key issue for both major political parties as they prepare for the 2014 election battle when Republican Gov. Rick Scott is on the ballot. Is Florida on track to become majority minority in 2014? A look at census data In this context, ""majority minority"" would mean that non-Hispanic whites represent less than half the population, while minorities -- blacks, Hispanics and other groups -- add up to more than half. We interviewed demographers, both in Florida and nationally, and all of them disputed Grayson’s claim. The evidence that Grayson’s office sent us from the census only showed that the percentage of non-Hispanic whites in Florida has shrunk since 2000. We looked up the most recent data on the census website, and it showed that 11 million non-Hispanic whites accounted for about 57 percent of Florida’s overall 19.3 million population, as of July 2012. So in Florida, minorities are about 43 percent. Census data showed a few states were majority-minority: Hawaii (77.2 percent minority), California (60.6 percent), New Mexico (60.2 percent) and Texas (55.5 percent).   Census data and other evidence cited by Grayson’s office didn’t prove that the state is about to flip to majority-minority next year. But his staff told us they think Florida is clearly on its way. ""The crossover point will take place earlier than projected, possibly as early as this year,"" said Grayson spokeswoman Lauren Doney. ""We readily acknowledge that other people may view the data and reach different conclusions; only time will tell."" University of Florida projections The census doesn’t make projections for changing demographics. For that, we turned to a 2013 study from the University of Florida’s Bureau of Economic and Business Research. Using the paper’s statewide projections, we looked at the non-Hispanic white population percentage through 2040. The percentage started with 57 percent in 2015 and then drops a percentage point or two every five years, until it hits virtually break-even in 2040. ""We project the proportion of the population that is non-Hispanic white to decrease over time, reaching 50.2 percent by 2040,"" Stefan Rayer, a research demographer, who co-authored the report with Stanley Smith, told PolitiFact Florida. It’s highly unlikely that the percentage of non-Hispanic whites would drop from 57 percent to 50 percent by next year, agreed University of Miami demographer Ira Sheskin. ""In fact, impossible,"" Sheskin wrote in an email. Florida’s future Hispanic population depends on a variety of factors that make projections -- particularly out to 2040 -- challenging. Those factors include whether immigration reform occurs, and the health of the economy in Florida, the nation and Latin America. ""In the case of Florida -- particularly Miami -- Miami attracted a lot of immigrants recently from Venezuela, Colombia and Brazil,"" said Mark Hugo Lopez, director of Hispanic Research for Pew Research Center. That’s a relatively recent phenomenon compared to the earlier waves of immigrants from Cuba, he said. ""Whether or not immigration reform happens -- whatever the push and pull factors are in Latin America -- that can all shape what happens in Florida."" Jeffrey Passel, a senior demographer at Pew, pointed to Census data that shows that the percentage of minority residents in Florida has grown slowly in the past couple of years -- from 42 percent in July 2010 to 43 percent in July 2012. If the share of minority residents were to increase at half a percentage point per year -- the average of the last two years -- ""it would take 14 years for Florida to become less than 50 percent white, not Hispanic."" Our ruling Grayson said, ""This is the year Florida becomes a majority minority state."" The state is inching closer to majority-minority status, but in 2012, non-Hispanic whites still accounted for about 57 percent of Florida’s population. Based on our research and interviews with the experts, it’s highly unlikely -- one expert said impossible -- that Florida will become minority-majority next year. It’s possible that it may not happen for many more years. A University of Florida study projects it won’t happen before 2040. There are a variety of factors that could speed up or slow down that process, but we found no evidence to support Grayson’s claim that Florida will become majority-minority this year. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280970A6140>],/factchecks/2013/oct/31/alan-grayson/florida-will-become-majority-minority-alan-grayson/
"['Georgia', 'Congress', 'Edward Lindsey']","
Who's scarier? Zombies or Congress.
","Readers, beware. You might encounter something spooky this Halloween. A zombie? Nah, more frightening than that. Yep, a member of Congress. Boo! It’s John Boehner and Nancy Pelosi at your door. ""[A] majority of voters actually prefer the blood-hungry creatures of The Walking Dead and Zombieland to the current Congress,"" state Rep. Ed Lindsey, R-Atlanta, wrote in a press release. ""One poll earlier this month found that a plurality of registered voters prefer real zombies over the pseudo variety haunting Washington today. (Even mother-in-laws and the DMV also outpolled Congress.)"" Lindsey even included a picture of one of the menacing creatures (to be clear, we’re talking about the zombies) in the press release. Despite his disdain for Congress, Lindsey is one of several Republicans running for the 11th District seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. The district encompasses conservative-leaning communities to the north and west of Atlanta. The current officeholder, Phil Gingrey, R-Marietta, is running for the U.S. Senate. So who’s scarier? Creatures who have returned from the dead to wreak havoc on the world or the men and women in Washington who recently took more than two weeks to resolve a partial government shutdown? PolitiFact Georgia thought it would be fun to find out whether Lindsey was using hyperbole in his quest to convince voters he is a less frightening option that the lot that’s currently in Congress. ""The Walking Dead"" is a popular TV show that follows survivors of a plague that turns people into zombies. In the show's post-apocalypse Atlanta, the undead stagger through downtown and through the countryside hungry for human innards. Public Policy Polling, a North Carolina-based firm, recently asked 502 registered voters by telephone a series of questions to determine how disliked is Congress. It was taken Oct. 4-6, a few days after the shutdown began. They asked the respondents ""What do you have a higher opinion of: Congress or zombies?"" Forty-three percent of the respondents said zombies, 37 percent said Congress. Nineteen percent said they weren’t sure. The poll had a 4 percent margin of error. The political party and racial breakdown of the respondents was pretty similar to that of other polls and U.S. Census data. Slightly more men than women answered the poll (53-47 percent), which differs from data that shows the majority of voters are women. There was no breakdown of how many respondents are zombies. Congress was less popular than a trip to the Department of Motor Vehicles, jury duty, toenail fungus and cockroaches. The congressional approval rating was 8 percent, which is nearly identical to most polling. Our political leaders in Washington did fare better than homegrown reality star Honey Boo Boo as well as controversial entertainers, such as Lindsey Lohan and Miley Cyrus. This is no cause for celebratory twerking, Congress. Lindsey said he based the claim on the PPP poll, although some of their polls has been said to favor left-leaning candidates. ""Based on my anecdotal conversations, if anything, I think the poll numbers may be higher (in favor of zombies),"" Lindsey said. We found no other polls on this topic. PolitiFact Georgia had one more question. Why would Lindsey would want to work in a place where his colleagues are so widely despised? ""I’ve seen just about every zombie show and, so far, the humans win,"" Lindsey explained with a hearty laugh. We have no reason to question the PPP’s accuracy on this topic.

HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius says 'it's illegal' for her to use the health insurance exchange
","Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius testified before Congress Oct. 30 for the first time since the federal health care marketplaces went online, answering questions about problems with the website and facing accusations that President Barack Obama lied to the American people about who could keep their health care plan. At the tail end of three and a half hours of testimony, Sebelius had a testy exchange with Rep. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who asked the secretary why she wasn’t enrolling in the exchanges herself. ""If I have affordable coverage in my workplace, I'm not eligible to go into the marketplace. ... It’s illegal,"" she said. The Twittersphere lit up after Sebelius’ remarks, questioning whether they were valid. Even the government’s own website instructs people with job-based insurance that ""if you'd like to explore marketplace coverage options you can."" So was Sebelius right and the Obamacare website wrong, or vice versa? Given the vast amount of misinformation circulating around the health care law and the insurance marketplaces, we thought it necessary to straighten this out. Employer insurance vs. Medicare We went right to the source on this one, asking the Department of Health and Human Services if Sebelius misspoke. It turns out she did. Individuals who have health insurance through their employer can sign up for the online marketplaces, it’s just not financially beneficial for most to do so. If an individual forgoes affordable insurance through work, he or she won’t qualify for subsidies to help pay for insurance on the government-run marketplaces. And plans purchased through an employer are typically cheaper because the company is paying a portion of the costs. A spokeswoman for the department said Sebelius meant to say, ""Marketplace plans cannot be sold to a Medicare enrollee, and the secretary is a Medicare enrollee."" While Sebelius receives health benefits from her government job, as of May, she is also 65 years old and therefore eligible for free Medicare Part A, which covers hospital visits. She can couple those benefits with her employer insurance, but according to guidelines released Oct. 4 by the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services, ""it is illegal to knowingly sell or issue a Qualified Health Plan to a Medicare beneficiary"" on the government-run insurance marketplaces. That hasn’t always been clear, said David Lipschutz, a policy attorney at the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Nothing in the Affordable Care Act mentions whether Medicare enrollees are eligible for the health insurance marketplaces, he said, but the administration lately has cited a section of the Social Security Act also known as the Medicare Anti-Duplication provision that bars private insurance companies from offering coverage to Medicare enrollees. There are some exceptions. A small fraction of individuals who are not eligible for free Medicare Part A and those with end stage renal disease can still buy insurance on the exchanges and receive federal subsidies. Neither of those situations apply to Sebelius. Hypothetically, Sebelius could abandon her government health care plan and get out of Medicare Part A. But that would require her to revoke and forfeit her Social Security benefits for the rest of her life, something we can’t envision anyone volunteering to do. ""It’s really not going to be an option to drop it in order to get into an exchange,"" said Andrea Callow, also a policy attorney with the Center for Medicare Advocacy. Our ruling It’s pretty clear Sebelius was wrong when she said ""it’s illegal"" for her to buy insurance on the exchange because she already has affordable insurance through her employer. Those inclined to do so certainly can, though the financial incentives to stay with the employer-based plan are quite convincing. We rate her statement Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097047D80>],/factchecks/2013/oct/30/kathleen-sebelius/sebelius-says-she-not-eligible-exchange-because-i-/
