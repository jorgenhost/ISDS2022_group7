Yes, Jan. 6 Capitol assault was an “armed insurrection”
","Five people died Jan. 6, 2021, including a U.S. Capitol Police officer, when a mob violently invaded the U.S. Capitol in protest of the November 2020 election results. Few arrests were made that day, but our understanding of the day’s events and the rioters’ motivations has grown over time, as more than 230 people have now been identified and charged, according to a database maintained by National Public Radio. But U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, still claims accounts of the day’s events are being exaggerated. He made his case Feb. 15, 2021, in an appearance on ""The Jay Weber Show"" on WISN radio. ""The fact of the matter is this didn’t seem like an armed insurrection to me. I mean armed, when you hear armed, don’t you think of firearms?"" Johnson said. ""Here’s the questions I would have liked to ask. How many firearms were confiscated? How many shots were fired? I’m only aware of one, and I’ll defend that law enforcement officer for taking that shot."" Johnson made a nearly identical claim later that morning on another Wisconsin radio show. Johnson is couching this as an opinion, but he’s attempting to make a factual case that Jan. 6 wasn’t an ""armed insurrection.""  So let’s review the evidence on that point. Johnson prefaced this comment by claiming that Democrats are painting a picture of every Trump voter being a violent rioter. Certainly not everyone in the crowd was armed. And many clearly came intending only to peacefully protest. But claiming this was not an armed insurrection goes well behind this line of thinking. Many in the crowd attacking the Capitol have said their intent was to stop the vote confirmation and keep Trump in office despite the election results. That’s an insurrection. That leaves us with his objection to the word ""armed."" Yes, carrying a gun would constitute being armed. But the definition of the word is much more broad, referring simply to carrying a weapon. So the question is whether this insurrection involved people carrying weapons. And it certainly did. First off we’ll note that any reports of weapons at the Capitol will greatly understate the quantity that was likely there. Only 75 people were arrested that day, and police weren’t doing any widespread searches that would have identified weapons on others present, NBC News notes. ""The cops weren't searching people,"" Mark Jones, a former agent of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives with 20 years of counterterrorism experience told NBC News in a Jan. 13, 2021, story. ""I'd speculate that there were many, many more firearms that were there that were not uncovered."" But news and official reports are filled with accounts of armed people at the Capitol. Fourteen people tied to the Jan. 6 attack are facing federal charges related to bringing or using dangerous weapons inside the building and two are facing firearms-related charges, according to the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia. NBC News reported that within a week after the attack a dozen guns and thousands of rounds of ammunition had been found on seven people arrested before and after the Capitol riot. Cleveland Grover Meredith, drove to Washington from Colorado with an assault-style Tavor X95 rifle with a telescopic sight, a Glock 9 mm with high-capacity magazines and more than 2,500 rounds of ammunition, including at least 320 rounds of armor-piercing bullets, NBC reported. Reuters said Meredith texted ""War time"" after hearing Vice President Mike Pence would count electoral votes from states Trump lost. In the trunk of Lonnie Coffman’s vehicle, police found an AR-15-style rifle, a shotgun, a crossbow, several machetes, smoke grenades and 11 Molotov cocktails, Reuters reported. Another man, Christopher Alberts of Maryland, was stopped as he left the Capitol grounds after a police officer spotted a loaded handgun on his hip. Many more people armed themselves by more unorthodox means, causing damage and injury. Robert Sanford, 55, of Pennsylvania, was allegedly caught on video throwing a fire extinguisher at a group of police officers. David Blair, 26, was seen hitting officers with a lacrosse stick, NBC said. Others had pepper spray, brass knuckles, a pipe and pocket knives, and one man was carrying a ""stinger whip,"" a tool with blunt and whip-like edges marketed for self-defense and escaping a locked vehicle. One rioter was caught on video beating a police officer with a flagpole bearing an American flag, NBC Washington reported. The New York Times reviewed video that showed people using stolen police shields, sticks and crutches as weapons. And the man photographed with his feet on the desk of U.S. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi was carrying a 950,000-volt stun gun walking stick, House impeachment manager Stacey Plaskett revealed Feb. 10. Not to mention pipe bombs were found near the Capitol at Republican and Democratic party headquarters. Johnson’s staff did not immediately return an email seeking evidence or explanation of his claim. Johnson said the Jan. 6 Capitol riot ""didn’t seem like an armed insurrection."" That’s ridiculous revisionist history. Overwhelmed police arrested and had direct contact with only a fraction of the mob that day, but we still can identify accounts of numerous weapons found in and around the Capitol, brought there in some cases by people who saw themselves as soldiers in a war. And many other rioters used whatever hard objects they could find to attack police and force their way into the Capitol. A majority of senators, through the impeachment vote, put the blame on Trump for stirring up the riot, though others debate the ""why"" question for the events of Jan. 6. But the ""what"" question shouldn't be debated. It was an armed insurrection. We rate this claim Pants on Fire.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097AC5080>],/factchecks/2021/feb/15/ron-johnson/yes-jan-6-capitol-assault-was-armed-insurrection/

Nabisco plant closures aren’t linked to Biden win, won’t shift jobs to Mexico
","Mondelez International, Nabisco’s parent company, announced Feb. 4 that it would close two biscuit bakeries by summer 2021, one in Fair Lawn, N.J., and the other in Atlanta. Social media users linked the company’s announcement to President Joe Biden’s election.  ""Nabisco is closing plants in Georgia and New Jersey moving to Mexico,"" reads a Feb. 11 Facebook post. ""Congratulations on electing Biden."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)

But there is no indication that the company’s decision to close the plants was linked to the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. (Other fact-checking organizations have also debunked this claim.) And the company says it’s not moving jobs or production from those sites to Mexico. Mondelez is based in Chicago, with U.S. headquarters in northern New Jersey. A spokesperson for Mondelez directed PolitiFact to its Feb. 4 statement, which said it would be focusing U.S. production on ""strategically located"" bakeries in Richmond, Va., Chicago and Portland, Ore. The company said the New Jersey and Georgia facilities were ""no longer strategic assets from a geographic footprint perspective.""  ""Both face significant operational challenges, including aging infrastructure and outdated production capabilities, which would have required significant investment to bring them to the modernized state required for the future,"" the statement read. Mondelez said production from the two closing sites would shift its other U.S. bakeries, not abroad. ""No U.S. jobs will go to Mexico related to these two closures, and U.S. biscuit production levels will be maintained,"" the company said. Posts claim that Nabisco is closing plants in Georgia and New Jersey and ""moving to Mexico"" because of Biden’s election. Mondelez, which owns the brand, announced the plant closures Feb. 4, but there is no evidence that they are due to Biden’s election.

Keystone XL suspension probably won’t boost oil prices for Americans
","One of President Joe Biden’s first official acts effectively halted construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which was designed to help carry up to 830,000 barrels per day of crude oil from Canada to the Gulf Coast. Does his executive order also make oil more costly for average Americans? A Facebook post, appearing eight days after the order, claimed: ""Stopping the pipeline did not change our use of oil. It just made oil more expensive for us to use. Thanks Joe!! What an idiot!!!"" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) There’s no evidence yet that Biden’s decision, which fulfilled a campaign promise dating back to at least May 2020, triggered any spike in oil prices that affects consumers now. But what about the impact over time? We talked to several experts to gauge what effect Biden’s order might have on future prices consumers pay for refined oil products like gasoline, diesel or heating oil.  Some said that given constant demand, taking away the pipeline option would make transporting crude oil less efficient and more costly, at least for producers. But most of them said they doubted that those higher costs would make their way to U.S. consumers, given where the Canadian oil was likely headed, and how the oil markets operate. The Keystone XL pipeline, first proposed more than a decade ago, was to have transported crude oil from Alberta, Canada, to Steele City, Neb., where it would connect with another leg stretching to Gulf Coast refineries.  The Trump administration backed the project in the face of objections from environmental groups. The company building it announced in March 2020 that it was launching construction, saying it would invest $8 billion in the project, with service expected to begin in 2023. But the project was stalled again by litigation over environmental concerns. Biden’s order revoked the pipeline’s construction permit. He said the pipeline would ""not be consistent with my administration’s economic and climate imperatives.""  For two benchmark products, the price of oil trended downward in the time between Biden’s order and the Facebook post. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil on the spot market was $53.16 per barrel on Jan. 20, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. It was lower each day between then and Jan. 28, the date of the Facebook post, when it was $52.26. The price of Europe Brent was $55.66 per barrel on Jan. 20. It rose 2 cents the next day, but then was lower each day and was $54.87 on Jan. 28. The U.S. Energy Information Administration and the Department of Energy told us they had no analyses on what suspending the pipeline might do to prices. Several energy economics experts we talked to said they saw no evidence that Biden's order has already had an impact on the cost of oil, particularly for consumers. Because the pipeline ""would not be available for some time, I do not see how the Biden decision could have already affected the price of oil for consumers,"" said Jay Hakes, administrator of the EIA during Bill Clinton’s presidency. ""If there is any long-term impact on prices at the pump, the change would be very small and unnoticed by customers."" Some experts expect that Biden’s order will result in higher costs in the future, at least for producers, if oil demand recovers.  ""It almost certainly will. Killing KXL does nothing to reduce demand for hydrocarbons. It will only make everything more expensive for consumers,"" said Michelle Michot Foss, a fellow in energy, minerals and materials at Rice University in Houston.  ""Constraining sources of supply, especially when demand is building, always impacts prices,"" Foss said. ""Give it a year."" Brook Simmons, president of the Petroleum Alliance of Oklahoma, said that ""without pipeline transportation, product must be moved by less efficient, more costly"" rail or truck.  Toby Mack, president of the Energy Equipment and Infrastructure Alliance, which represents businesses that support natural gas and oil operations, cited a 2014 report from the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service on railroad transportation of crude oil that said ""railroad transport reportedly costs in the neighborhood of $10 to $15 per barrel compared with $5 per barrel for pipeline."" That report also said the Keystone XL ""could move a significant proportion"" of crude oil shipments ""off the rails, as pipeline transportation is likely to cost less per barrel."" Other experts don’t see those higher transport costs automatically being passed on to U.S. consumers, for a variety of reasons. They point to larger market forces that affect prices, including the relatively high worldwide supply of oil. Plus, they note, most oil passing through the Keystone would have been exported, so Americans wouldn’t be the ones paying for it. Less pipeline capacity likely means Canadian oil producers have to use rail more to transport oil to refiners. But they would be under competitive pressure to absorb the added costs of that rather than passing them on, said Richard Masson, chairman of the World Petroleum Council Canada and an executive fellow at the University of Calgary School of Public Policy. ""This is because U.S. refiners, particularly on the Gulf Coast where KXL was aimed, have the ability to import crude from tankers, and therefore pay the global price for it,"" he said. ""If Canadian crude was to get more expensive than global crudes on tankers, the U.S. refiners would shift to a higher level of tanker imports."" Hakes said most analysts believe that delivery by rail is somewhat more expensive than delivery by pipeline, ""but the difference is slight and transportation of crude oil to refineries is a very small part of the overall cost of gasoline at the pump. That is why, if the argument is that motorists will see a difference in purchase prices, it is highly dubious.""  Moreover, the world can currently produce much more oil than is needed to meet demand, so ""I am confident that the cancellation or delay of the Keystone pipeline would not have any impact on gasoline prices at the pump,"" Hakes said. Global demand for oil has been depressed over the past year by economic slowdowns caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Economics professor Robert Godby, deputy director of the University of Wyoming's Center for Energy Regulation and Policy, said oil prices are set in world markets and ""we don’t suffer from supply constraints in this country that raise the cost of oil.""  The Keystone XL ""could have alleviated some local and regional pipeline bottlenecks in the upper Midwest and northern Rocky Mountain region, but overall should not have been expected to lower oil or gasoline prices in the U.S.,"" he said. Keystone XL was not designed to supply the U.S. market, but to deliver oil from Canada mainly for export to foreign markets, said Tyson Slocum, energy program director at Public Citizen. The consumer advocacy group, which opposes the pipeline, has argued that historically, the average U.S. price of gasoline rises when domestic oil exports increase.  A Facebook post claimed Biden’s order stopping the Keystone XL pipeline ""made oil more expensive for us to use."" We found no evidence to support the claim that Biden’s order has made oil more expensive for consumers. Spot market prices for benchmark products fell slightly in the days after the order. As for the future impact, some experts said that without the pipeline project, Canadian oil producers would face higher costs to transport oil, which could raise consumer prices. But most of the experts we spoke with said they didn’t expect the higher transport to affect U.S. buyers, since the Canadian oil was mostly destined for export and producers would face competitive pressure to absorb the added transport costs rather than passing them along. They also say transportation costs are a small factor in the cost of oil products. We rate the statement Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097179500>],/factchecks/2021/feb/15/facebook-posts/keystone-xl-suspension-probably-wont-boost-oil-pri/

Fact-checking Laura Ingraham’s claim about immigrants staying in hotels
","As former President Donald Trump was tried in the Senate for inciting an insurrection, Fox News host Laura Ingraham accused Democrats of plotting their own insurrection by ""enticing illegals to bust through our borders, exploit our resources and commit crimes."" Ingraham said immigrants were exploiting American hospitality. ""You may not have stayed in a hotel in the past year, but illegals arriving since Biden’s inauguration, they get to stay free of charge,"" Ingraham said Feb. 8, citing a report in the New York Times. ""It sounds so pleasant. Can you believe that? At a time when our own people are suffering,"" Ingraham said, after reading a snippet from the report.  As part of a story about an influx of migrants at the U.S. border with Mexico, the New York Times reported that some migrants arriving in San Diego were quarantining in a hotel in order to comply with California’s 10-day quarantine requirement for out-of-state travelers. ""To guard against the coronavirus, health authorities in San Diego have arranged housing for hundreds of arriving migrants in a downtown high-rise hotel, where they are being quarantined before being allowed to join family or friends in the interior of the United States,"" the newspaper found. A clip from Ingraham’s monologue was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) So PolitiFact decided to put her claim about ""illegals"" at hotels to the Truth-O-Meter. We spoke with immigration experts and Jewish Family Service of San Diego, the nonprofit social-services agency that’s helping families through their hotel quarantines in San Diego.  It’s true that arriving migrants are quarantining in a hotel in at least that one location, they said. But they said Ingraham was wrong to characterize the public health measure as an amenity for ""illegals."" It involves migrants who were let into the U.S. to seek asylum. ""The hotel stay is not a vacation,"" said Nicole Hallett, an associate clinical professor of law and the director of the Immigrants’ Rights Clinic at the University of Chicago. ""It is designed as a public health measure to protect the entire community."" Eitan Peled, a border services advocate with Jewish Family Service, said the migrants quarantining at the hotel include some who came through ports of entry and some who were apprehended after entering the country unlawfully.  ""Every one of these migrants is asserting their legal right to seek international protection in the United States,"" Peled said. The hotel-quarantine setup in San Diego was covered in the New York Times’ report, and also by KSWB-TV, a Fox affiliate in San Diego, and the San Diego Union-Tribune.  KSWB-TV reported Feb. 9 that the migrants in question ""have been allowed to remain in the U.S. after asking for asylum"" and were turned over to Jewish Family Service. Immigrants who are physically present in the U.S. can seek asylum regardless of whether they are in the country legally or illegally, as PolitiFact has reported. They generally have to apply for asylum within one year of arriving in the U.S. For that reason, immigration experts took issue with Ingraham’s characterization of the migrants in San Diego’s hotel as ""illegals."" ""A person can seek asylum at a port of entry to the United States or within the interior of the United States,"" said Erin Barbato, director of the Immigrant Justice Clinic at the University of Wisconsin Law School. ""If a person crossed the border without inspection, that person was not ‘admitted’ into the United States, but that does not make the person ‘illegal.’"" In San Diego, the immigrants quarantining in a hotel are those who have been released by immigration officials while they wait to present their case in an immigration court, Peled said.  They have ""passed a credible fear interview conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, and are now awaiting their asylum cases in the U.S.,"" he said. When immigrants claim asylum, they are processed and either detained or released to friends or family who promise that they will appear at future court hearings, Hallett said. But getting people to their sponsors can be tricky in a pandemic, when travel is restricted. ""Thus, the government releases people to a local nonprofit that assists with the quarantine and then ensures that they arrive at their final destination,"" Hallett said. ""It appears that Jewish Family Service is playing this role in San Diego."" Peled said JFS is helping families through their quarantines by providing case management as well as financial and travel assistance. He said the effort is part of San Diego County’s ability to access federal funding for reimbursement of ""non-congregate sheltering"" — that is, temporary living arrangements that avoid crowding to reduce the risk of spreading the coronavirus. A spokesperson for the Border Patrol in the San Diego sector told the San Diego Union-Tribune that COVID-19 restrictions have caused some facilities to reach ""maximum safe holding capacity,"" prompting the release of some migrants before their court hearings. The practice of releasing immigrants until they appear before a judge was less common under Trump, Barbato said. The Trump administration starting in 2019 forced migrants to wait in Mexico while their cases moved through the immigration system.  It isn’t clear how many places are using hotels like San Diego. The Associated Press reported that a Texas charity was testing migrants released by the Border Patrol for COVID-19 and sending those with infections to isolate in a hotel. A Fox News spokesperson cited the transcript from Ingraham’s show, where she referred specifically to what was happening in San Diego after first mentioning the hotel quarantines.  But Ingraham’s broader claim that ""illegals … get to stay free of charge"" could have given some viewers the impression that President Joe Biden’s policy was opening up free hotel rooms along the border to immigrants who were in the country unlawfully. White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Feb. 10 that the ""vast majority have been turned away."" In the video clip, Ingraham said, ""You may not have stayed in a hotel in the past year, but illegals arriving since Biden’s inauguration, they get to stay free of charge.""  Ingraham’s sweeping comment exaggerated the facts. In San Diego, under an arrangement with local health authorities and a local nonprofit, migrants seeking asylum have been quarantining in a hotel before traveling elsewhere to await their court cases.  These migrants have been cleared by federal authorities to be in the country while they pursue their asylum claims, even if some entered unlawfully. Their hotel stays are part of public health measures to help contain the spread of COVID-19. Ingraham’s claim contains an element of truth but gives a misleading impression by omitting important context about the circumstances of their hotel stays. We rate this claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097B3F900>],/factchecks/2021/feb/15/laura-ingraham/fact-checking-laura-ingrahams-claim-about-immigran/

Democrats say 40% of people with college debt didn't get degrees
","Rep. Alma Adams, D-N.C., says many Americans carrying heavy student loan debt aren’t even getting their money’s worth. Her comments come as the Biden administration considers action to relieve some student loan debt. ""Almost 40% of borrowers with student loan debt didn't finish their degree. Now, they face the worst of both worlds: all of the debt and no degree,"" Adams tweeted on Feb. 9. Is it true that nearly 40% of borrowers didn’t finish their degree?  Adams’ tweet caught our attention because it didn’t cite a source for her claim. When we reached out to Adams’ office, a spokesman said Adams got the statistic from Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Warren tweeted a similar claim on Jan. 27, saying: ""Up to 4 in 10 people with student loan debt weren’t able to graduate, many because of high costs, so now they’re in the worst of both worlds—crushed by debt, with no diploma to boost their earnings."" Warren mentioned the statistic again during a Feb. 3 confirmation hearing for President Biden’s nominee for education secretary. (Warren has previously misstated facts about student loans.) After speaking with Warren’s office and tracking down the origins of this claim, it appears the stat shared by Warren and Adams is on track. However, it's based on a limited data set with a short tracking period. Warren’s office said her source is data compiled by the National Center for Education Statistics and analyzed by Mark Huelsman, former associate director of policy and research for Demos, a progressive think tank. Huelsman now works as a fellow at Temple University’s Hope Center for College, Community, and Justice. He’s also a fellow at the Student Borrower Protection Center, a nonprofit advocacy group. Huelsman told PolitiFact that he looked at students who entered college in the 2011-12 school year who had taken on debt from public or private lenders. Then he looked at whether those students graduated by 2017. ""I looked at cumulative debt. If you had any debt at any point going to college, did you graduate?"" he said. The number that emerged from his research: 38.6% of people who took out student loans in that six-year span did not complete their college education in that period. PolitiFact reached out to other experts about Huelsman’s findings.  Adam Looney, an economics expert and senior fellow at the Brookings Institute, and Judith Scott-Clayton, a professor of economics and education at Columbia University, said they analyzed the same NCES data and got virtually the same result. Of course, Huelsman’s analysis is just a snapshot of a specific time period. Experts at the NCES and the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan think tank, look at graduation rates in six-year windows because that period can account for part-time students and other variables, as explained in a recent institute report. However, some people do return to school outside the six-year timeframe and ultimately earn their degree,"" said Jill Barshay, a writer and editor for The Hechinger Report, a nonprofit newsroom that covers education. ""The problem with the six-year time frame is that many many people take longer than 6 years to get a degree,"" Barshay said in an email. ""I don't know what percentage of them eventually do. Some colleges like to use an 8 year period for measuring how many students complete their 4 year degrees."" We asked Looney and Scott-Clayton if they’re aware of other significant studies on the issue. They said information tracking individual debt repayment and college completion over the long term is hard to come by.  ""This every-8-year survey is the best that is readily available,"" Looney said. In an email, Scott-Clayton said: ""Unfortunately, the number of datasets that link information on borrowing with information on degree completion are rare. A lot of student loan borrowing statistics (e.g. that come out of the Federal Reserve Banks) are based on credit report data — these are not connected to any info on degree completions. That's why we have to rely on these NCES surveys which track people over time and gather a lot of rich info, but are only fielded every so often."" Huelsman pointed out that his 38.6% figure for student-loan borrowers tracks with overall college graduation trends. The NCES last year reported that the overall six-year graduation rate for most full-time undergraduate students was 62% in 2018, meaning nearly 40% didn’t graduate. In the debate over whether lawmakers should forgive student loan debts, Looney says it’s important to note that the nearly 40% of non-graduates do not hold 40% of the debt. ""While 39% of borrowers did not complete a degree, they account for only 23% of ebt borrowed,"" Looney said. Bachelor’s degree holders account for 41% of all borrowers, but hold 64% of the debt, Looney said. Adams tweeted ""almost 40% of borrowers with student loan debt didn't finish their degree."" Three different analyses of data from the National Center for Education Statistics found that 38% to 39% of people who took out college loans between 2012-2017 didn’t finish college in that period. While there's a lack of data on this specific issue, experts say this analysis is the most reliable to date.

Trump impeachment defense lawyer wrongly singles out antifa in Capitol riot
","On the fourth day of the Senate impeachment trial, a lawyer for former President Donald Trump singled out a left-wing activist as a key instigator of violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6. From the Senate floor, Michael van der Veen blamed ""extremists of various different stripes and political persuasions"" for the insurrection, which took place while Congress counted electoral votes. However, he named one group in particular. ""One of the first people arrested was a leader of antifa,"" said van der Veen, a personal injury lawyer. ""Sadly, he was also among the first to be released."" ""Antifa"" is short for anti-fascist. The term refers to a broad left-wing coalition of activists that seek to protest white supremacy and other far-right causes, sometimes by using violence. It is not a single group, but rather an ideology. The House of Representatives impeached Trump on Jan. 13 and charged him with ""incitement of insurrection,"" maintaining he stoked doubt over the results of the 2020 election and encouraged protesters in Washington to march toward the Capitol. However, Trump’s defense team says Trump did not direct his followers to participate in the Jan. 6 insurrection — instead, they argue, the crowd was infiltrated by extremists. RELATED: A timeline of what Trump said before Jan. 6 Capitol riot We’ve debunked several claims that antifa activists were behind the Capitol insurrection, so we wanted to take a closer look at van der Veen’s claim. A left-wing activist was arrested nine days after the riot for allegedly breaking into the Capitol. However, he denied being part of the antifa coalition. There is no evidence that antifa activists incited or planned the insurrection. Many members of right-wing groups were arrested around the same time. We reached out to van der Veen through his law firm to find out who he was referencing in his comment. We did not get a response. But coverage of arrests following the Capitol riots did describe one controversial left-wing activist from Utah as being among those who stormed the Capitol. His name is John Sullivan, the founder of Insurgence USA, an activist group that says it protests police brutality. Sullivan was arrested Jan. 14 and charged with one felony count of interfering with law enforcement in connection with a civil disorder, as well as misdemeanor charges of unlawful entry and disorderly conduct. He was released from jail the next day. A U.S. magistrate judge placed strict restrictions on Sullivan. He was banned from using social media and attending protests, given a location monitor, and ordered to remain at his home and look for a job outside of Insurgence USA. He was also prohibited from possessing firearms.  Sullivan’s Twitter accounts frequently used #antifa, #blm, and other anti-Trump or anti-police hashtags. He has also been filmed using incendiary language in the past. But Sullivan previously told PolitiFact that he’s not part of the antifa coalition. And Sullivan has been singled out before by some left-wing activists as not being fully aligned with their cause. An FBI affidavit filed in support of the criminal complaint did not mention Sullivan being part of any anti-fascist groups, and we could find no other criminal history.  Many other criminal complaints explicitly tie rioters to right-wing groups including the Three Percenters, Proud Boys and Oath Keepers  — names that van der Veen did not mention on the Senate floor. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the District of Columbia has charged dozens of people with crimes related to the Capitol riot. Some of the suspects were arrested days before Sullivan was taken into custody. Take for example Jacob Chansley, a QAnon supporter known as the ""Q Shaman,"" who was arrested Jan. 9 and charged with violent entry, disorderly conduct, and with ""knowingly entering or remaining in any restricted building or grounds without lawful authority."" Two other men were charged the same day: Adam Johnson of Florida, who was photographed in the Capitol wearing a Trump knit hat, and Derrick Evans, a former Republican member of the West Virginia House of Delegates. Both were arrested prior to Chansley. Other rioters sporting right-wing causes were arrested around the same time as Sullivan.   Kevin Seefried of Delaware was photographed carrying a Confederate battle flag after allegedly breaking into the Senate building through a window. He was taken into custody Jan. 14. Then there’s Robert Packer, who was arrested Jan. 13 in Newport News, Va. Packer was photographed inside the Capitol wearing a sweatshirt emblazoned with ""Camp Auschwitz,"" a reference to the Nazi death camp.  The Washington Post combed through footage from the insurrection and identified other symbols associated with neo-fascists and extremist groups. Affidavits from the FBI also allege that several suspected rioters had ties to right-wing groups. There is no evidence that antifa activists played a similar role. The Associated Press reviewed public records for more than 120 people identified at the insurrection and found that they included GOP donors, members of far-right militia, and supporters of QAnon. ProPublica archived more than 500 videos taken Jan. 6 that show people in and around the Capitol wearing Trump apparel and carrying Confederate flags. FBI Assistant Director Steven D'Antuono said during a Jan. 8 press briefing that there was ""no indication"" that antifa activists were involved in the insurrection. Van der Veen said during the Senate impeachment trial that after the Capitol insurrection, ""one of the first people arrested was a leader of antifa."" That’s not accurate. There is no evidence that antifa activists were behind the Jan. 6 riot. Sullivan was arrested nine days after the insurrection. He posted #antifa on social media, but he has denied being a part of antifa and an affidavit associated with his arrest did not mention him being a part of the coalition. Many other criminal complaints explicitly tie rioters to right-wing groups that van der Veen did not mention.

No indication that Biden administration is planning to shut down the Florida border
","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sent out a fundraising plea attacking the Biden administration for considering domestic travel restrictions in an effort to curb the spread of a highly contagious COVID-19 variant.  President Joe Biden ""is trying to shut FL’s border,"" DeSantis texted potential donors. In an accompanying email, DeSantis said: ""Joe Biden is considering treating Florida like East Berlin and shutting down our border over ‘coronavirus concerns.’"" Is that so? We found no indication of anything so dramatic. We reached out to DeSantis’s office and asked where they had gotten the information that the Biden administration was planning to shut down the Florida border. Cody McCloud, a DeSantis spokesperson, did not answer our questions directly and instead referred us to a Twitter video posted to the governor’s account. What he says in the video is far less sweeping than what he claimed in the fundraising email. DeSantis’ fundraising message followed a front-page article in the Miami Herald on Feb. 10. The story quoted an anonymous government official saying that the Biden administration was considering new domestic travel restrictions for regions affected by the highly contagious U.K. strain of the coronavirus. Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention show that Florida currently has a third of the nation’s cases of the U.K. COVID-19 variant.  But according to the Herald, the White House has not said that it is considering a Florida travel ban. It’s unclear so far what particular domestic travel regulations the administration is weighing and how they would be implemented. The administration has not publicly discussed a border shutdown as an option. One possible restriction could be to require travelers to show negative COVID-19 test results before they take domestic flights. During a Feb. 7 interview, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said that the Biden administration was considering this idea. Such a requirement would not apply to Florida in particular, but to the U.S. more broadly. Desantis imposed travel restrictions on travelers from some states earlier in the pandemic. On March 23, 2020, he required travelers from coronavirus hot spots like New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut to self-quarantine for 14 days. Later that month, he ordered the Florida Highway Patrol to set up checkpoints on a highway connecting Florida and Louisiana.  In public appearances, Biden spokespeople and federal officials have stressed that no policy announcements regarding travel restrictions are coming soon.  ""We are always considering what steps are necessary to keep the American people safe, but we are not currently in the process of… No decisions have been made around additional public health measures that would delay or would change, I should say, domestic travel considerations,"" White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Feb. 11. The Miami Herald story quoted two anonymous federal officials who said that ""no policy announcements are imminent,"" and that ""any move to restrict travel or impose new health measures would be taken in partnership with state and local governments."" It’s not clear that the president has the power to close a state border. The right of Americans to travel interstate in the United States has never been substantially judicially questioned or limited, according to Meryl Justin Chertoff, the executive director of the Georgetown Project on State and Local Government Policy and Law. ""The baseline ... is that freedom of movement within and between states is constitutionally protected,"" Chertoff wrote. Desantis said Biden is trying to close Florida’s border. A story in the Miami Herald quoted an anonymous source saying that the Biden administration was considering new domestic travel restrictions in response to COVID-19 spread. But there is no indication that banning travel to or from Florida is on the table.  This claim is False. ​ Jill Terreri Ramos contributed to this fact-check.",[<zip object at 0x0000028096F31040>],/factchecks/2021/feb/12/ron-desantis/no-indication-biden-administration-planning-shut-d/

Medicaid not directly linked to abortions in Texas
","Texas has strict abortion regulations, and Gov. Greg Abbott indicated this month that he intends to make them stricter.  In his state of the state speech Feb. 1, Abbott said that in the upcoming legislative session he will encourage laws ensuring ""that the life of every child will be spared from the ravages of abortion.""  A bevy of bills have been filed to further restrict abortion in Texas, including one that would ban the practice all together. But Abbott and fellow Republican state leaders have long targeted one of the state’s largest abortion and family planning providers: Planned Parenthood.   Last month, after years of litigation, Texas health officials gave Planned Parenthood a 30-day notice before kicking the organization off the state’s Medicaid program. Just before the Feb. 3 deadline, Planned Parenthood sued and a judge blocked state officials from removing Planned Parenthood as a Medicaid health care provider.  Abbott posted a tweet Jan. 24 anticipating that Feb. 3 deadline, saying that ""innocent lives will be saved"" thanks to the state’s actions. Planned Parenthood and state leaders are longtime mutual adversaries, squaring off in court multiple times over the years over abortion restrictions. The battle over Medicaid funding began in 2015 when state officials complained that an undercover video shot by abortion opponents showed Planned Parenthood officials in a Houston clinic agreeing to illegal activity, such as changing abortion procedures to better acquire fetal tissue for researchers. Planned Parenthood officials argued that the video was heavily edited and an Austin federal judge ruled that it did not prove any illegal activity occurred. An appeals court disagreed. But will the state’s latest move to cut Planned Parenthood from Medicaid funding result in curbing the state’s abortion numbers, as the governor claims?  Since 1976, Medicaid has been prohibited from funding abortion services under the Hyde Amendment, passed three years after the landmark Roe vs. Wade Supreme Court decision.   The law, which bars the use of federal dollars to pay for abortion, was introduced by U.S. Rep. Henry J. Hyde, R-Ill., who famously said, ""I certainly would like to prevent, if I could legally, anybody having an abortion, a rich woman, a middle-class woman, or a poor woman. Unfortunately, the only vehicle available is the … Medicaid bill.""  Federal Medicaid dollars that flow through the Texas Medicaid program to Planned Parenthood are, thanks to the Hyde Amendment, not allowed to be used for abortion services. Instead, Planned Parenthood uses those funds for non-abortion services for Texas’ poorest women — services such as mammograms, cervical cancer screenings, contraception and STI tests.  Last year, Medicaid dollars paid for the health care and family planning services of 8,800 Medicaid patients at Planned Parenthood clinics across Texas, according to Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas. This money is paid to the organization through reimbursements. For instance, Planned Parenthood receives $71.50 for every Depo-Provera birth control shot administered to a Medicaid patient, or $8.30 in reimbursement for every HIV rapid test. Of Planned Parenthood’s 40 clinics around the state, nine are licensed to perform abortion procedures. Last year, those nine centers performed 14,220 surgical or medication-induced abortions. Virtually all of these procedures were paid for by patients out-of-pocket or by third-party grants. According to experts, Abbott’s tweet connecting Medicaid funding to abortions is a misrepresentation.   ""That statement indicates that somehow this funding is being used to provide abortions, (but) the funding is not allowed to do that,"" said Kari White, a University of Texas associate professor of social work and a faculty researcher at the Population Research Center. ""That’s a misrepresentation of the way this funding is used and what care can be provided with it.""  Instead, the effect of removing Planned Parenthood from the Medicaid program will cut access to specialized health care for 8,800 women, experts say. If Texas’ bid to cut Planned Parenthood from Medicaid is ultimately successful, that means women who qualify for Medicaid — such as a single mother of two who makes less than $230 a month — would lose access to Medicaid-funded cancer screenings, contraception, and other preventative healthcare services.   ""It’s problematic to say that innocent lives will be saved. Given that if people can’t get access to mammograms and cervical cancer screenings, perhaps lives will be lost,"" said associate professor Abigail Aiken of the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. It’s unclear how Abbott connects Medicaid dollars to abortion — his office did not respond to several requests for comment regarding his tweet. But it’s not the first time rhetoric around the abortion issue in Texas has connected the two.   Joe Pojman, executive director of Texas Alliance for life — which is backing a proposal to ban abortion beginning at fertilization (Texas law bans abortions after 20 weeks) — argues that Planned Parenthood places women on a pathway that, for many, ultimately leads to abortion. Although ""it’s difficult to make a causal relationship,"" Pojman argues that many women seeking pregnancy-related services at Planned Parenthood are ultimately getting referred to Planned Parenthood abortion facilities.   ""There’s definitely referrals going on,"" he said. ""That’s certainly part of Planned Parenthood’s practices — is to refer women for abortions.""  And women who are seeking non-pregnancy related health services build a ""client relationship"" with Planned Parenthood. Then, if those women later become pregnant, Pojman said, ""they know who to call.""  ""A woman searching for breast or cervical cancer screening or high blood pressure screening, if they do a pregnancy test on her and she's positive, then they'd do a referral to their abortion facility,"" he said.  However, because medical referral information is protected under the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, Pojman said he hasn’t seen any records showing this connection. ""It’s reasonable to believe that fewer women going to Planned Parenthood facilities for any reason will likely result in fewer abortions,"" he said.  Planned Parenthood spokesperson Sarah Wheat says that none of these claims have factual basis. A standard component of family planning services is providing nondirective pregnancy counseling, Wheat said. All patients are informed of all of their legal and medical options.  ""Providing patients with referrals for all of their medical options is not unique to Planned Parenthood,"" Wheat said.   Furthermore, Pojman’s argument ignores the fact that many women rely on Planned Parenthood to obtain contraception and avoid unwanted pregnancies, said Aiken. According to Planned Parenthood’s own data, 82,400 Texas women received birth control through Planned Parenthood last year.   Abortion referrals ""seems to be exactly what would be precipitated by kicking Planned Parenthood out of Medicaid,"" Aiken said. ""If there are no Medicaid funds to help low-income patients get contraception, I would imagine that more abortion referrals would be necessary precisely because of the lack of funding.""  Pojman said Texas’ own family planning services program could easily absorb the 8,800 Planned Parenthood Medicaid patients.  Created by the Legislature, Healthy Texas Women launched in 2016 to provide family planning and health care services to low-income women. It served 173,000 women in 2018, the most recent year for which data is available.  While the program offers services including pregnancy testing, STD testing, breast and cervical cancer screenings and others, it follows Texas’ ethos of excluding abortions within its continuum of care.  But the program is not without drawbacks and shortcomings, said White, who conducted a survey of the program’s provider network in 2019.   ""What we have found in our research is that it is not so easy for patients to just transfer their care someplace else. In some communities, there aren't very many providers for patients to go to,"" she said.  White’s research, done with the Texas Policy Evaluation Project, found that many Healthy Texas Women providers don’t offer a full range of contraceptive options or lack clinicians trained to place or remove birth control implants or intrauterine devices.  ""There's a lot of variability in the network. Where you go for services is going to determine the kind of services that you get,"" White said.  Abbott’s tweet tied Medicaid funding of Planned Parenthood to abortions, and said that the state’s efforts to exclude Planned Parenthood from Medicaid would save ""innocent lives.""  Since 1976, Medicaid dollars have never been used to fund abortion or abortion-related services thanks to the Hyde Amendment. Instead, the federal funding the state is attempting to block from Planned Parenthood provides family planning services and healthcare for 8,800 Medicaid patients. Because Abbott’s office did not respond to requests for comment, it’s unclear how he connects Medicaid funding to abortions. Other anti-abortion advocates like Pojman of the Texas Alliance for Life argue that Planned Parenthood’s referral practices lead women to abortion facilities, although he couldn’t provide proof of that claim.  Due to the lack of evidence establishing this connection, and because the burden of proof is on the speaker, we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280975B3FC0>],/factchecks/2021/feb/12/greg-abbott/medicaid-not-directly-linked-abortions-texas/
"['Elections', 'Wisconsin', 'Coronavirus', ""Dan O'Donnell""]","
No, absentee rejection rate in November was not a “stunning anomaly”
","The November election has come under attack on a variety of fronts from a variety of sources. Former President Donald Trump and his backers have taken aim at voting machines, vote reporting, vote counting, the mail-in voting process and more. Many of those claims centered around Wisconsin, a key swing state that backed Trump in 2016 but supported Democrat Joe Biden in 2020. Election officials in the state have been unanimous that it was a free and fair election, with no evidence of fraud outside the usual scattered cases — and certainly no fraud that would have reversed Biden’s 20,000-vote margin of victory. Not to mention the recount that upheld the margin of victory. Three months later, many remain unconvinced. Conservative radio host Dan O’Donnell raised a new claim about election integrity in a Feb. 3, 2021, commentary piece written for the MacIver Institute, a conservative think tank based in Madison. In a piece headlined, ""Wisconsin’s Miraculous Vanishing Ballot Rejection Rate,"" O’Donnell asserted the low number of absentee ballots rejected in the November 2020 election was a ""stunning anomaly."" He implied something questionable was at play. ""This is nearly impossible to explain,"" O’Donnell wrote. ""Did hundreds of thousands of Wisconsinites suddenly figure out how to correctly fill out their ballots? Or was there a concerted effort to count as many ballots as possible without regard to whether they were correctly filled out? The evidence points toward the latter."" O’Donnell’s core claim has two elements: That the rate of absentee rejection was an anomaly, and that the tally should be considered questionable — or even evidence of a conspiracy of some kind. We took a closer look at both elements. O’Donnell’s claim runs into immediate trouble when we look at the historic trend of absentee ballot rejections. His commentary included a chart showing six elections since April 2016, with four having an absentee rejection rate above 1.4%, and the November 2018 and November 2020 elections having a rejection rate of 0.2%. O’Donnell described this as evidence ""ballots suddenly stopped getting rejected in the two statewide races in which unpopular Republicans (Scott Walker and Donald Trump) were on the ballot."" But zooming out farther shows the November 2020 numbers were to be expected since November elections have consistently lower rejection rates for absentee ballots. From 2008 to 2020, clerks rejected an average of 0.62% of absentee ballots in November elections, according to Wisconsin Elections Commission data. The August, April and February elections ranged from 1.4% to 2.2%. In addition, the rejection rate in November elections has steadily dropped over time, decreasing every November but one from 2008 to 2020. The outlier election was in November 2016, due to a change in state law. In 2016, the state Legislature passed a law stating an absentee ballot may not be counted if it is missing the address of a witness. Every absentee ballot in Wisconsin must be signed by both the voter and a witness, who must also provide an address. As a result, the absentee rejection rate jumped from 0.31% in November 2014 to a 1.35% in November 2016. But election officials had become concerned some voters wouldn’t be aware of the witness address requirement, so in October 2016 the commission — on a motion made and seconded by Republican members — voted to advise clerks they should fix missing address components based on ""reliable information."" This guidance passed very close to the November 2016 election, so it wasn’t followed widely enough quickly enough to affect the rejection spike in that election, WEC spokesman Reid Magney said.  Once clerks had time to incorporate the new guidance, the November rate resumed its descent — to 0.23% in November 2018 and 0.2% in November 2020. In other words, limiting the timeframe to 2016-20 as O’Donnell did treats the November 2016 number as a baseline and the November 2018 and 2020 numbers as outliers. Putting that data in context makes it clear 2016 is actually the outlier. And, of course, November 2020 is in line with similar elections in the past. That brings us to the question of why November elections — in 2020 and before — would have lower ballot rejection rates than other elections. This is essentially the question O’Donnell’s raises throughout his column, but he never contacted state election officials to seek out the answer, Magney said. It turns out, it’s a pretty straightforward explanation. The difference in ballot rejection rates is primarily because of how people vote. November elections bring a surge in early voting, which is still counted as absentee but takes place in a clerk’s office with the clerk as the witness. ""This eliminates chances that their ballot will be rejected for an insufficient (witness) certification,"" Claire Woodall-Vogg, executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, told PolitiFact Wisconsin in an email. Looking at 2016 to 2020, for example, elections commission data shows in-person absentee votes accounted for an average of 19% of all votes in November elections, but only 7.3% of the vote in the April elections — even with the spike in in-person early voting in April 2020 due to the pandemic. (We also checked elections further back to confirm this was an ongoing trend.) For those using traditional mail-in ballots, Woodall-Vogg said Milwaukee elections ""cured"" — that is, used reliable information to fill out missing witness information, per commission guidance — a total of 1,063 ballots in November. That generally meant simply filling in ""Milwaukee, WI"" for voters who included a street address but forgot the city and state and could be confirmed as living there. ""We wouldn’t make presumptions about a witness’s address; if we couldn’t read the witness’ name or there were multiple people by the same name, we would either call the voter or return their ballot via mail,"" Woodall-Vogg said. Why did the rejection rate continue the downward trend in November 2020 despite the high volume of mail-in absentee ballots? Magney noted some improvement in rejection rate would be expected from April to November 2020 since in April many voters were casting a mail-in ballot for the first time and in a short timeframe, while in November they had more time to find witnesses and return ballots, and clerks had more time to send deficient ballots back to voters to be corrected.  Woodall-Vogg also noted clerks around the state were taking steps to educate voters given the expected influx of absentee voting. ""Election administrators and community groups all made an intentional effort to educate voters on the requirements when voting by mail due to the increase with COVID,"" Woodall-Vogg said in her email. ""The WEC created new absentee instructions which were finally in plain English and even included photos. The media covered the requirements far more than ever before, as did we via outlets like Facebook and media interviews. On the exterior of our drop boxes, we had large stickers with STOP signs, asking voters to check if they signed, their witness signed, and their witness provided their address."" Finally, Magney noted the rejection figures cited by O’Donnell are only one way to handle flawed absentee ballots, making it an imperfect measure of how many absentee ballots ultimately don’t count. If a ballot is to be thrown out, some clerks mark this as a rejected ballot, while others record it an ""administrative ballot cancellation."" While the number of absentee ballot rejections dropped from April to November of 2020, the number of administrative ballot cancellations nearly quadrupled. ""The assignment of these labels is entirely at the discretion of local clerks,"" Magney said in an email. Before we move on to the ruling, let’s pause for a moment to take a wider view. This is far from the first conspiracy claim involving the 2020 election. And it’s a reminder that a good first step when examining any claim of coordinated wrongdoing is to consider the scope. If there were something nefarious at play, who would have to be in on it? The answer in this case stretches well into the quadruple digits. Wisconsin’s elections are overseen by the Wisconsin Elections Commission, but we’re not talking about a generic policy in this case. The rejection rate is the accumulation of thousands of individual, local decisions on whether (and how) to reject a given ballot. Those decisions are made by the 1,850 municipal clerks around the state, and the thousands more deputy clerks and volunteers they work with. Asked if he was alleging a coordinated effort across a group of nearly 2,000 clerks, O’Donnell said, ""Clearly ballot mistakes that were accepted in these elections would not have been, and were pretty obviously not, accepted in other elections."" O’Donnell asserted in an opinion piece that November election data shows a ""stunning anomaly in the rejection rate of absentee ballots."" But that rejection rate was neither stunning nor an anomaly. Election data from 2008 to 2020 shows November elections have consistently lower rejection rates than other elections, due primarily to the higher number of in-person early voting (which is included in absentee tallies). And the November rejection rates themselves have steadily dropped in each election aside from 2016, when a new law caused a one-year spike. The November 2018 and 2020 rejections rates were in line with that long-term trend. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967B4440>],/factchecks/2021/feb/12/dan-odonnell/no-absentee-rejection-rate-november-was-not-stunni/

Did Pritzker prioritize inmates, pols and college kids for vaccination?
","Illinois’ entry into the second phase of its COVID-19 vaccination plan means many more residents are eligible, but not everyone agrees the state is prioritizing the right groups as vaccine demand still outpaces supply. In an image shared on Facebook and Twitter, the Illinois Republican Party said Democratic Gov. J.B. Pritzker’s ""Hierarchy of Vaccine Priorities"" puts prisoners, politicians, and college students into Phase 1B — the current vaccination phase — ahead of ""individuals with high-risk health factors, and everyone else."" Like other states, Illinois’ vaccination plan is modeled from federal guidelines, but states aren’t required to uniformly implement the non-binding guidance. So we decided to take a look at the groups the state GOP claimed are now eligible in Illinois. State lawmakers and inmates are now eligible, but college students are not. Along with people 65 years or older and frontline essential workers, inmates are part of Illinois’ second vaccination phase, which began Jan. 25. Pritzker is no renegade on this. The Federal Bureau of Prisons is providing vaccines to inmates, and at least 13 other states have included the group in their first two vaccination phases, according to a comparison of state prioritization plans from the Kaiser Family Foundation. U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidance says states may choose to vaccinate individuals living in congregate facilities — including prisons or jails — at the same time as frontline staff because of the increased risk of transmission in such close quarters. Pritzker’s administration also added Illinois lawmakers to Phase 1B on Feb. 3 following requests from some members of the General Assembly. The requests came after several people tested positive for the coronavirus during the House’s lame-duck session at the Bank of Springfield Center in January. Both the state House and Senate also canceled session days scheduled for February.. State lawmakers in Colorado, Hawaii and Maryland are also being vaccinated in the second phase. Members of Congress have been receiving vaccines since the distribution began. Still not eligible are individuals with high-risk health conditions from ages 16 to 64 who are not frontline essential workers. Pritzker recently announced the group will be added Feb. 25, which would make Illinois the 18th state to include them in their first two phases, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation comparison. Chicago and suburban Cook County, which receive doses separately from the federal government, have opted out of the expansion because of supply shortages. CDC guidelines say people younger than 65 years with high-risk medical conditions do not need to be prioritized until the next phase of eligibility, Phase 1C. That means the state remains in line with federal guidance. There is nothing in the Illinois vaccination plan allowing college students as a group to qualify. A spokesperson for the Illinois Republican Party said its assertion that college students currently qualified for vaccinations was based on a WCIA-TV report in which a student is seen receiving the vaccine at the I Hotel Conference Center in Champaign. The report also identifies her as a medical student, which according to the Champaign-Urbana Public Health District puts her squarely into another group that is eligible — healthcare workers. Spokespeople for the Illinois Department of Public Health and the governor’s office confirmed college students who do not work in healthcare or another position covered in the current phases do not qualify. The Illinois Republican Party says ""Pritzker’s Hierarchy of Vaccine Priorities"" puts prisoners, politicians and college students into Phase 1B, ahead of ""individuals with high-risk health factors, and everyone else."" It’s true inmates and state lawmakers currently qualify for vaccinations, and those under the age of 65 and others who are not frontline workers do not — including people with underlying health risks. But it’s not true college students as a group are eligible. College students may only receive the vaccine right now if they meet other qualifying criteria. The GOP’s post also ignores how the Pritzker administration’s prioritization plan for inmates and those with high-risk medical conditions is in line with federal guidance. We rate it Half True.

Wisconsin Assembly Minority Leader right on relationship between mask mandates and COVID-19 cases
","Masks have once again become a political volleyball in the Wisconsin State Capitol. Assembly Republicans voted on Feb. 4, 2021 to overturn Gov. Tony Evers’ order requiring people to wear face coverings to mitigate the spread of COVID-19 — sealing the deal after the Senate took action a week prior. Evers responded by immediately issuing a new mandate.  The next day, Democrats in the Assembly introduced legislation requiring masks, a measure that is likely to go nowhere in the GOP-controlled Legislature. Amid the back and forth, Democrats chastised their Republican colleagues for playing politics with public health and argued masks are necessary to push the state through the final stages of the pandemic. Among those to speak out was Assembly Minority Leader Gordon Hintz. ""At the end of the day we know mask mandates work,"" the Oshkosh Democrat said in a Feb. 5, 2021 interview on the Wisconsin Public Television program Here & Now. ""There’s enough evidence out there between counties that have done it and counties that haven’t."" Is Hintz onto something? Let’s take a look. When asked for evidence to support Hintz’s claim, his office pointed to a study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and Kansas Department of Health and Environment that analyzed the impact of mask mandates on Kansas counties. Kansas’ governor issued an executive order requiring face coverings in public spaces starting July 3, 2020. A state law enacted the month prior allowed counties to opt out of the state mandate, which 81 of 105 did without implementing their own mask rules.  Researchers found the seven-day rolling average of new daily cases per 100,000 people decreased by 6% in the 24 counties with mask mandates after the governor’s order. In counties without a mandate, COVID-19 incidence increased by 100%.  The study noted that 13 counties with mask mandates and seven counties without mandates also had other mitigation strategies in place, such as limiting the size of gatherings and how many could eat in restaurants. Still, researchers concluded that ""strategies related to mask use mandates appear to be important."" ""The decrease in cases among mandated counties and the continued increase in cases in nonmandated counties adds to the evidence supporting the importance of wearing masks and implementing policies requiring their use to mitigate the spread of SARS-CoV-2,"" the study stated. The Wisconsin Medical Society cited the Kansas study in a Feb. 1, 2021 memo to Assembly lawmakers asking them to oppose the repeal.  The group also referenced research from Goldman Sachs estimating that mandates gradually increase the number of people who ""always"" or ""frequently"" wear masks by about 25 percentage points, and the number who ""always"" wear masks by 40 points. Another study published in June 2020 found a ""significant decline"" in daily COVID-19 cases in states with mask mandates, with the effect increasing over time. Researchers cautiously estimated that 230,000 to 450,000 COVID-19 cases may have been averted by May 22, 2020 due to the mandates.  Meanwhile, researchers in Canada found a 25 to 46% average weekly reduction in new cases in the first few weeks after mandates were adopted, while the number of people who reported always wearing a mask in public increased by about 30 percentage points.  When studying the impact of mask mandates, it’s important to consider whether people follow them and if they’re enforced, said Ajay Sethi, an epidemiologist and associate professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He said it can be difficult to assess mandates individually when they’re issued with other public health guidelines, but he believes the Kansas study offered compelling data on the matter.  ""You could argue that with or without a mandate, people might wear a mask because that’s what they do and the mandate is just confirming what they do,"" he said. ""At the end of the day, an entire county had fewer cases."" And ultimately, Sethi said, mandates remind people about the importance of wearing face coverings to guard against COVID-19.  ""If we didn’t have mandates, would you expect mask use to go up?"" he said. ""I wouldn’t."" In a TV interview, Hintz said, ""At the end of the day we know mask mandates work. There’s enough evidence out there between counties that have done it and counties that haven’t."" Multiple studies have suggested mask mandates can lead to a decline in COVID-19 cases. Researchers caution that factors like compliance and enforcement should be taken into consideration, but masks have ultimately proven to be an effective tool in combating the virus.  We rate Hintz’s claim True.     ",[<zip object at 0x00000280972E12C0>],/factchecks/2021/feb/12/gordon-hintz/wisconsin-assembly-minority-leader-right-relations/

S.D. governor gives state high marks in handling the pandemic. Are they deserved?
","COVID-19 has pushed states to adopt unique approaches to protect their residents, but few have garnered as much scrutiny as South Dakota.  Its governor, Kristi Noem, refused to enact a mask mandate or close any businesses. She argued these precautions were a matter of personal choice, even at large gatherings, such as a July 3 political event at Mount Rushmore and the annual motorcycle rally in Sturgis that was connected to COVID-19 cases in Minnesota and other nearby states. She sees success in the approach. In a recent television interview, Fox News’ personality Laura Ingraham asked Noem, a Republican, why she believes news outlets criticize her handling of the pandemic. Her response: While her state sought to protect high-risk populations and keep hospitals from overflowing with patients, she said, it was done in a way that still allowed residents to earn a living. ""That was a unique approach that, for our people, really worked well,"" she said in the segment. ""We did have tragedies and we did have losses. But we also got through it better than virtually every other state."" That got us wondering. Is South Dakota really ""through"" the pandemic? And on what measures is this statement based? We first reached out to Noem’s office to ask these questions. In an email, communications director Ian Fury didn’t address the first question. On the second, Fury cited South Dakota’s standing in these categories: vaccine distribution, unemployment, the number of people moving to the state and the state’s budget surplus. Fury dismissed using ""an apples-to-apples"" comparison between South Dakota and other states on measures such as deaths and case counts, saying such assessments are flawed because the timing of surges and the metrics used can vary by state. Several metrics can offer clues about how a state is managing the pandemic, experts said. In the health category, the number of deaths per capita is one way to track the most severe COVID-19 cases, said Kumi Smith, assistant professor of epidemiology at the University of Minnesota.  This metric is not a real-time snapshot of how quickly the virus is spreading in a community, given the lag in reporting deaths. But Smith said it can provide ""a much fuller picture of what’s going on with the pandemic"" than case counts alone. That’s because case counts can wax and wane depending on other factors, such as the availability of coronavirus tests and which populations a state prioritizes for testing, she said. In South Dakota, 1,815 lives have been lost to the pandemic, making its per capita death rate, as of Feb. 10,  205 people for every 100,000 residents, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The state’s death rate ranks among the 10 worst in the nation. Another key health metric is positivity rates — or the percentage of people tested who have the virus. It can indicate whether a state is regularly testing enough of its residents, said Dr. Amesh Adalja, an infectious-diseases physician and senior scholar at the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins University. Positivity rates vary based on how they are calculated. Data from the South Dakota Department of Health and the CDC show the average weekly positivity rate peaked in the spring. Few tests were being done at the time, which means every positive result would have a greater impact on the rate. The Johns Hopkins COVID-19 Tracker, which uses a different method, shows the state’s rate peaked in November. High positivity rates can indicate a lack of adequate testing that allowed the virus to spread unchecked, said Adalja. ""Their death count may be even higher,"" he added, because some of those cases may not have been properly tested and identified as caused by COVID-19. Last week, the positivity rate hovered slightly under 7%, as reported by the state. Johns Hopkins researchers placed the figure closer to 20% as of Feb. 3. Both are above the 5% threshold recommended by the World Health Organization to reopen a community safely. Hospitalization data — specifically, the number of intensive care unit beds occupied — can also help gauge how a state is handling the pandemic, public health experts said. By comparing the number of beds occupied in intensive care units to the year before the pandemic, said Smith, the metric can show whether hospitals could keep up with the demand caused by the virus. News reports indicate some South Dakota hospitals struggled to keep up with demand in the fall when the state’s outbreak peaked. As of Feb. 10, state data shows about half of adult and pediatric ICU beds in the state were available. Public health experts noted South Dakota has emerged as a national leader in distributing COVID-19 vaccines to its residents, ranking among the top 10 states with the most residents vaccinated per capita. Most of the metrics Noem’s office highlighted related to South Dakota’s economy. And, indeed, the state has the lowest unemployment rate in the country and ended the budget year with a $19 million surplus. How did the state manage to pull that off during a pandemic? Evert Van der Sluis, a professor of economics at South Dakota State University, said several factors helped. The state experienced less of an economic decline than initially projected at the start of the pandemic because of federal aid, conservative revenue projections and a multibillion-dollar investment in wind energy, he said. South Dakota — where agriculture is the top industry — also benefited from billions of dollars in direct federal government payments to farmers, said Van der Sluis. While some of these payments were connected to the pandemic, others helped offset the financial losses caused by fallout from a U.S. trade dispute with China. However, Van der Sluis said, these indicators don’t capture the depth of the damage caused by the pandemic.  They also don’t necessarily show how South Dakota compares with other states, because they don’t take into account that variations in population density, tax revenue and industries all influence how a state manages an outbreak. ""We can talk about economic well-being,"" he said, ""but some of the enormous harm done by COVID-19 is not reflected at least in the short run by economic measures."" It may become apparent in long-term measures like health care spending and lost productivity, he added. While the lack of lockdowns may have also played a role in keeping South Dakota’s economy afloat, said Lucy Dadayan, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, there are other states that raked in cash while also implementing strict public health measures. Case in point: California. As reported by Politico, California defied expectations of an economic downturn due to tax revenue from its wealthiest residents and their stock market gains. Ultimately, Dadayan said, a state’s ability to stay financially afloat depends on a variety of factors — which makes it more difficult to draw comparisons between states and their economic performance during the pandemic. ""It all matters,"" she said. Both public health measures and fiscal stability represent important pieces to forming a full picture of how the state is handling the pandemic, experts said. As Van der Sluis noted, these metrics are imprecise instruments for measuring the damage from a deadly health crisis. In addition, comparing states wholesale is difficult given their differences and the dynamic nature of the pandemic, as various sources noted. And, though South Dakota is currently experiencing a decline in case counts, with a total of 109,580 cases to date and growing concern nationwide about the virus’s emerging variants, it’s hard to say the state has ""come through"" the pandemic.  Noem’s statement on South Dakota’s performance cherry-picked the data, emphasizing the state’s economy while giving less weight to the lives lost and burden of disease its residents suffered.

Walker exaggerates effect of Trump drug order, Biden freeze
","A Republican running for U.S. Senate in North Carolina says Joe Biden is already raising drug prices for some of the most vulnerable Americans. Former Congressman Mark Walker hopes to replace U.S. Sen. Richard Burr, who won’t seek reelection next year. Two days after Biden’s inauguration, Walker took aim at the new Democratic president. ""The disdain for President Trump and his accomplishments are so deep that President Biden is raising the prices of insulin and Epi-Pens on those with high costs and the uninsured,"" Walker tweeted. He linked to this story by Modern Healthcare. Walker’s claim is similar to others that have been fact-checked by PolitiFact and other media. Walker is referencing President Trump’s executive order requiring community health centers, specifically, to give the lowest price possible for insulin and injectable epinephrine to their low-income and uninsured patients. However, Walker’s tweet exaggerates the effect of Trump’s order, and the effects of Biden’s decision to freeze it. Community Health Centers, sometimes referred to as Federally Qualified Health Centers, or FQHCs, are government-supported clinics that help people facing financial obstacles to care and prescription drugs.  Before Trump left office, his administration signed-off on a rule requiring those centers to pass along discounts they’re receiving through the federal government’s 340B program. The idea was to prevent mark-ups. Sayeh Nikpay, associate professor of health policy and management at the University of Minnesota School of Public Health, emailed PolitiFact for a separate story on the Trump order. Her email described the program this way: ""The program was designed to allow community health centers the opportunity to raise some funds from the sale of discounted drugs to patients. What this means in practice is that when an insured patient goes to the clinic, the clinic bills insurance and gets to keep the difference between the mandated acquisition price (usually about half of the full cost) and the insurer reimbursement. Lawmakers have been okay with this because safety net clinics are federally funded and don’t typically have that many insured patients, so this should be happening on the margins."" Indeed, experts told PolitiFact that any extra money is marginal at best.  While it’s true that Biden froze all of Trump’s pending rules at once, it’s misleading to suggest Biden did it out of disdain.  Adam Fein, a business consultant who runs a blog about pharmaceutical economics, wrote that he was surprised by Trump’s decision to target community health centers. ""I generally consider these covered entities to be the good guys of 340B,"" Fein wrote in July after Trump announced his plans. ""Notably, the executive order doesn’t mention hospitals, which are the worst abusers of the 340B program."" As the health department noted in its December summary of Trump’s order, health centers are already required to reinvest any income from the 340B Program into patient services. Also in the summary, the U.S. Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) said it’s aware of the health centers’ ""compliance with the 340B statute and strong track record of using the savings generated to benefit patients."" The National Association of Community Health Centers released a Jan. 25 statement saying Trump’s administration misunderstood the issues. The red tape created by his order would have hindered the centers’ ability to serve their patients, said Colleen Meiman, policy advisor for State Associations of Community Health Centers. ""All the Trump order did was say ‘If you can’t prove (you’re passing along the discounts), we’re going to punish you,’"" Meiman told PolitiFact in a phone interview. The U.S. HRSA estimated that each health center would, on average, need to hire an additional worker at about $50,000 a year ""to support necessary additional administrative processes."" Trump’s order was scheduled to take effect on Jan. 22. However, on Jan. 20, Biden’s administration froze Trump’s order until March 22.  Walker’s tweet implies that Trump’s order had already lowered the prices of those medicines. But it hasn’t become law yet. Even if Trump’s order had taken effect on Jan. 22, those drug prices wouldn’t have gone down immediately, said Karyn Schwartz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation health advocacy group. The providers affected by Trump’s order would need to come into compliance by the time they apply for their annual grant, she told PolitiFact in a phone interview. ""It wasn’t like a switch was going to get flipped on the 22nd,"" Schwartz said. The Biden administration hasn’t yet said whether Trump’s order will be scrapped altogether. Walker said Biden ""is raising the prices of insulin and Epi-Pens on those with high costs and the uninsured."" Biden froze a directive that would have ordered some health centers to provide insulin and epi-pens at the same price they purchased them through a government program.  But experts say the health centers were already providing the discounts. Furthermore, Biden froze Trump’s order before it ever took effect, so it’s inaccurate to suggest prices are going up. The program’s status quo will continue until a final decision is made.

DHS didn’t deem supporting Trump to be terrorist behavior
","Some social media users are claiming that the Department of Homeland Security has labeled them terrorists for opposing COVID-19 restrictions and believing that Donald Trump won the 2020 election.  ""Behavior the White House and DHS deemed as terrorism today!"" an image on Instagram. ""Resisting COVID regulations, opposing government, spreading ‘misinformation,’ thinking the election was rigged.""  ""In other words if you are Trump supporter you are a terrorist!"" reads the caption.  National security experts told PolitiFact that the claim is misleading.  ""The conspiracy theory has no validity,"" said Jason Blazakis, former director of the Counterterrorism Finance and Designations Office at the State Department.  This claim appears to refer to a National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin released Aug. 13 by Alejandro Mayorkas, the secretary for homeland security.  The system was established in 2011 to replace a similar system created in the aftermath of the Sept. 11, 2001, terror attacks. The system releases two types of warnings to the American public: alerts and bulletins. Alerts, which are issued when DHS has ""specific, credible"" information about a terror threat, are the more serious and urgent of the two. Bulletins communicate ""general trends"" that could potentially escalate into threats of terrorism.  The Aug. 13 bulletin warned of a ""current heightened threat environment across the United States,"" citing the 20th anniversary of 9/11 and other forces, including threats posed by ""domestic terrorists, individuals and groups engaged in grievance-based violence, and those inspired or motivated by foreign terrorists and other malign foreign influences."" It continued: ""These actors are increasingly exploiting online forums to influence and spread violent extremist narratives and promote violent activity. Such threats are also exacerbated by impacts of the ongoing global pandemic, including grievances over public health safety measures and perceived government restrictions.""  It said that violent extremists who are ""racially- or ethnically-motivated"" or ""anti-government/anti-authority"" remain a national threat priority, and warned they ""may seek to exploit the potential re-establishment of public health restrictions as a rationale to conduct attacks.""  It also warned that ""domestic violent extremists"" have been introducing and amplifying online narratives that promote violence, including ""continued, non-specific calls for violence on multiple online platforms"" associated with such ""ideologies or conspiracy theories on perceived election fraud and alleged reinstatement, and responses to anticipated restrictions relating to the increasing COVID cases."" Nowhere does the advisory bulletin label all Trump supporters or conspiracy theorists terrorists. Nor did the bulletin add specific groups or individuals to existing lists of terror organizations. And it does not say that ""resisting COVID regulations"" and ""thinking the election was rigged"" amounts to terrorism.  The bulletin ""doesn’t designate any individuals or groups as domestic terror organizations,"" said Faiza Patel, director of the Brennan Center’s Liberty & National Security Program. ""It is similar to statements by the director of national intelligence and the FBI that identify domestic terrorism as the principal threat facing the U.S. at this time and uses the same terminology."" The legal authority to officially designate groups as terrorists belongs to the U.S. departments of State and Treasury, not to the National Terrorism Advisory System. And that authority doesn’t allow for American citizens to be designated as terrorists unless they are linked to a designated terrorist group based overseas, said Blazakis.  ""There is no legal mechanism that exists to designate individuals who may be connected to groups like the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, Three Percenters and the like,"" he said.  An Instagram post claimed that DHS ""deemed as terrorism"" behavior that includes ""resisting  COVID regulations"" and ""thinking the election was rigged."" In summary, the caption to the post read, ""if you are a Trump supporter, you are a terrorist."" A National Terrorism Advisory System bulletin cited anger over COVID-19 restrictions and online threats to government officials as points of political tension that could escalate into violence.  The advisory bulletin doesn’t label all Trump supporters or conspiracy theorists terrorists. Nor does the bulletin add any specific groups or individuals to existing lists of terror organizations. And it does not equate disagreeing with COVID-19 regulations"" or ""thinking the election was rigged"" with terrorism.

Old, manipulated photo of giant skull recirculates online
","Social media users are recirculating a pair of Facebook posts from 2012 that purport to show paleontologists in Greece uncovering the skeletal remains of a giant, including a massive skull.  Although they have been shared thousands of times, the images are manipulated. The original photo does not show a giant human skull at the excavation site.  The Facebook posts were flagged as part of the company’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  Reverse image searches revealed that the images are manipulated versions of a photograph from University of Chicago paleontologist Paul Sereno’s discovery of a plant-eating dinosaur species, Jobaria, during a dig in the Sahara of central Niger, an African country, in the 1990s.  The original photograph, published in several places by the University of Chicago and also in a 1999 news report from BBC News, does not include the giant skull seen in the Facebook posts.  ""It is my photograph of my team that I took in Niger in 1993 during the excavation of a dinosaur skeleton that I would later name Jobaria,"" Sereno said in an email to PolitiFact.  An illustration shows Sereno's original photo beside the edited version, which recirculated on Facebook in October 2021. The results from Sereno’s excavation were published in 1999 in the journal Science, and the discovery was covered at the time by the Washington Post, the Chicago Tribune, National Geographic and other outlets. The long-necked dinosaur weighed an estimated 20 tons and lived approximately 135 million years ago, according to those reports. ""With 95 percent of its skeleton preserved, the new species stands as the most complete long-necked dinosaur ever discovered from the Cretaceous Period,"" Sereno said in a 1999 news release documenting his team’s findings. In 2019, Snopes fact-checked the same two manipulated images purporting to show a giant skull among the bones Sereno’s team dug out in Niger.

Actually, wind turbines easily produce more power than it takes to build them
","Wind farms are a pillar of America’s climate change strategy. They now produce over 8% of the nation’s electricity, and their output is expected to nearly double over the next decade. A Facebook post casts wind as a losing proposition. ""A windmill could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it,"" a Sept. 16 version of the post says. This qualifies as a zombie claim. In 2019, we found an earlier version False, but it walks again. The image is topped with a striking photo of a wind turbine on fire (it comes from a March 2020 fire in Texas) and gives some details. ""A two-megawatt windmill is made up of 260 tonnes of steel that required 300 tonnes of iron ore and 170 tonnes of coking coal, all mined, transported and produced by hydrocarbons,"" the post says. (We corrected several typos in the text.) The post is wrong. From construction to demolition, the energy payback on a windmill can be less than a year. The highest estimate we found was a bit under six years. The numbers in the post come from a 2009 collection of essays on climate change and Canada. J. David Hughes, a geoscientist with the Geological Survey of Canada, wrote about the total energy package for wind turbines, a perspective that included how much energy it took to make the turbine, not just the energy it produced when it was operational. ""The question is: how long must a windmill generate energy before it creates more energy than it took to build it?"" Hughes wrote.  Hughes’s focus was on the need to put turbines in places where the wind blows. ""At a good wind site, the energy payback day could be in three years or less,"" Hughes wrote. ""In a poor location, energy payback may be never.""  The Facebook post skipped over that sentence, and jumped to Hughes’ warning, that in the wrong spot, a windmill ""could spin until it falls apart and never generate as much energy as was invested in building it."" (There’s a logical breakdown here: If a turbine is spinning, then the wind must be blowing, and the turbine is producing power.) Also, wind turbine technology has changed greatly over the past 10 years, as engineers have developed more efficient models and gained experience in siting windmills. The 2009 material is dated. For decades, researchers have been assessing all the steps that go into turning wind into electricity. Study after study has found that when all is said and done, a properly placed turbine nets out positive. A 2016 study from Danish engineers looked at onshore and offshore turbines and wrote, ""The energy payback time was found to be less than 1 year for all technologies."" A group of engineers in Texas did similar work and reported that ""the payback times for CO2 and energy consumption range from 6 to 14 and 6 to 17 months,"" with on-shore facilities having a shorter payback. There are many steps in the making of a wind turbine. The raw materials need to be mined, those materials need to be turned into rotors and towers and those parts need to be shipped. It takes energy to install a turbine, and a small bit of energy to operate it. And at the very end — after 20 to 30 years — it has to be dismantled and recycled. Research finds that as much as 86% of the total energy comes in the manufacturing step, although some studies found lower percentages. There are a few key variables, including how long the wind turbine lasts — manufacturing costs are baked in, and the longer a turbine lasts, the more years those costs get spread over. Another key variable is the wind. Turbines may have a predicted output, but the wind determines what really happens. One 2019 study from engineers at the University of Texas at Arlington factored in the wind speeds from a working wind farm in Texas with 200 turbines. It examined in detail the energy it took to move the turbine components from where they were made in Spain to the Lone Star Wind Farm near Abilene, Texas. It also measured the energy it took to get raw materials to the factories in Spain where manufacturing took place. The wind at the Lone Star Wind Farm varies and the researchers used that data to find the actual average wind speed through the year.  They calculated a turbine that lasts 20 years will reach a full energy payback in less than six years.  A viral image said that a wind turbine ""could never generate as much energy as was invested in building it."" The claim cherry-picked a quote from a book and distorted its meaning. Every study of the lifecycle of wind turbines finds that they produce more energy than it took to produce them. Most analyses put the energy payback period at about a year or so. The most conservative, real-world assessment we found calculated that wind turbines in Texas produced more electricity than it took to build them after about six years. We rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280967E74C0>],/factchecks/2021/oct/12/viral-image/actually-wind-turbines-easily-produce-more-power-i/

Youngkin fancifully links McAuliffe to federal order on school meetings
","Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin is making baseless claims that his Democratic opponent, Terry McAuliffe, has urged the White House to ""sic the FBI"" on Virginia parents attending local school board meetings. ""Terry calls in his friend Joe Biden to actually put the DOJ on Virginia parents,"" Youngkin said during an Oct. 6 interview on Fox News. DOJ, or the Department of Justice, oversees the FBI. Youngkin made the accusation again in an Oct. 6 interview on Fox News Radio. ""Now that parents have stood up and said ‘Terry, we’re rejecting this whole philosophy,’ he goes and gets his friend Joe Biden to dispatch the Department of Justice and the FBI to try to silence parents in Virginia who are standing up for their children,"" Youngkin said. ""...If you don’t agree with his big government policy to put government and politicians and bureaucrats between you and your children, if you don’t agree, he’s going to get his friends to sic the F.B.I. on you,"" he added. And Youngkin made a similar statement during an Oct. 5 radio interview on WLNI in Lynchburg.   ""The frustration that parents are feeling is when Terry McAuliffe puts government between them and their children,"" he said. ""And that's exactly what parents have been asking for, a role in having their voices be heard. And now we see Joe Biden and Terry McAuliffe attempting to silence parents completely by intimidating them by force."" Background Youngkin’s statements were triggered by U.S.Attorney General Merrick Garland’s Oct. 4 order that the FBI work with local governments to help handle what he called ""a ""disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence"" against school board members and educators. School systems in Virginia and across the nation have seen angry protests against mandatory mask wearing for students, transgender accomodation policies and the alleged teaching of critical race theory.   Garland’s order came six days after Biden received a letter from the National School Boards Association asking for ""for federal law enforcement and other assistance to deal with the growing number of threats of violence and acts of intimidation occurring across the nation.""  The letter footnoted news articles about 20 different intimidation attempts against school officials around the country. It included a June 23 TV report about an abruptly ended Loudoun County, Va. school board meeting where one person was arrested and another ticketed for trespassing.  Garland’s order has drawn backlash from conservatives across the country who, like Youngkin, call it a liberal effort to weaken parents’ influence on education policies.  Youngkin has been highly critical of Virginia’s Board of Education, accurately claiming that it has weakened school accreditation standards and inaccurately saying it has allowed critical race theory to be taught in all schools. Youngkin has launched a TV ad criticizing McAuliffe’s statement in a Sept. 28 debate that, ""I don’t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach."" Youngkin’s ""proof"" McAuliffe’s campaign said McAuliffe never encouraged Biden or anyone in the White House to address security for educators and school boards. Youngkin’s campaign failed to provide us with any evidence to the contrary. McAuliffe, a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee, often says he has a close relationship with Biden that has benefitted Virginia. McAuliffe served a previous term as governor from 2014 to 2018 that overlapped with Biden’s tenure as vice president from 2009 to 2017. Youngkin’s campaign sent us two tapes of McAuliffe saying, during the 2020 presidential race, that Biden had been his go-to man when the state needed federal help. ""When he was in the Obama-Biden White House, everytime we needed help I called Joe Biden,"" McAuliffe said on one occasion.  Youngkin’s campaign also sent videos of McAuliffe saying three times in the spring that, if he’s elected, he would call Biden to seek a waiver from the Affordable Care Act that would allow Virginia to expand its health insurance exchange.    ""We still have 700,000 Virginians who are without access to healthcare...,"" McAuliffe said on May 22. ""So as governor what I’ll do — the first thing I’ll do — is get us a Section 1332 waiver here in Virginia."" Youngkin’s campaign said that since McAuliffe has always relied on Biden, it’s reasonable that he would have called the president to ask for FBI protection of educators. ""All the evidence points to Terry McAuliffe supporting Joe Biden’s menacing attempt to intimidate concerned parents,"" campaign spokesman Matthew Wolking wrote in a statement. McAuliffe has not publicly taken a position on Garland’s order. Wolking also noted that White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said on Oct. 8 that McAuliffe was ""running on (Biden’s) agenda."" Psaki, however, was answering a question about Biden’s falling popularity in Virginia — not about Garland’s order. We should note that PolitiFact National on Oct. 11 gave a False rating to U.S. Sen. Rick Scott’s claim that ""Joe Biden’s attorney general wants the FBI to go after parents for speaking out at school board meetings to protect kids from radical curriculum like critical race theory."" PolitiFact pointed out that Garland specifically said that ""spirited debate"" is protected. His memo targeted threats that go beyond passionate speech, and said nothing about critical race theory. The line between sincere debate and words that intimidate isn’t always clear, and there is a concern that officials might apply an overly broad interpretation. In the past, courts have ruled against that sort of loose approach to defining what constitutes a threat. Nothing in Garland’s memo says that is part of the plan. Our ruling  Youngkin says, ""Terry (McAuliffe) calls in his friend Joe Biden to actually put the DOJ on Virginia parents."" McAuliffe says he never contacted Biden or anyone in the White House to request FBI protection for educators facing increasing protest for school policies on health and social issues. Youngkin provides no proof to the contrary.  This is a made-up claim by Youngkin on a highly charged issue, and he’s said it at least three times.

Will the IRS track 'every' Venmo transaction? Fact-checking claims on new financial reporting plans
","From splitting restaurant checks to paying rent to roommates, the words ""I’ll Venmo you"" have become increasingly commonplace.  So, it makes sense that a new Treasury Department proposal that would modify financial reporting requirements for banks and cash apps has thrown some people into a tizzy. But some of the plan’s details have become muddled on the internet. One variation of the rumor warns that a Biden proposal will allow the government to monitor every bank account transaction or cash app withdrawal and deposit.  Conservative commentator Candace Owens repeated this in a tweet, writing that ""the Biden administration is attempting to empower the IRS to monitor every single withdrawal, deposit, and transaction you make from your personal banking accounts, PayPal, Venmo, etc..""  But this isn’t right. First, The American Rescue Plan Act, which was passed by Congress in March, has a provision that will go into effect on Jan. 1 that requires cash apps like Venmo, PayPal and Zelle to send information reports to merchants and the IRS regarding business transactions totaling more than $600. Previously, cash apps were required to report only business transactions over $20,000 from accounts with at least 200 separate payments in a calendar year. A second, pending Treasury proposal by the Biden administration, meanwhile, would also require financial institutions such as banks to report to the IRS annually the total overall amount of deposits and withdrawals from most bank, loan and investment accounts that also exceed $600, with no minimum number of transactions required of the accounts. This includes both business and personal accounts. Neither proposal changes the taxes you are expected to pay. The Rescue Plan measure only applies to commercial transactions that are already considered taxable income — not Venmo transactions between friends for, say, happy hour drinks. And not commercial transactions that may not be considered taxable after expenses are deducted.  The Treasury proposal calls for financial institutions, including cash apps, to track total deposits and withdrawals to find major tax reporting discrepancies. The Treasury proposal, which came out in May 2021 and is subject to congressional approval, is aimed at getting better information to find tax cheats. Banks would report only the aggregate inflows and outflows that exceed $600, not details on individual transactions. ""Banks already report directly to the IRS the interest that they pay on accounts when it exceeds $10,"" Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in a Sept. 28 Senate hearing. ""And this is not a proposal to provide detailed transaction-level data by banks to the IRS."" The Treasury Department clarified further in an emailed statement to PolitiFact:  ""The Administration’s bank reporting proposal does not track transactions in your bank account, or payments you make on Venmo, Paypal, or with any other payment service provider. The proposal adds two additional boxes to existing information reports that banks send to the IRS already. Specifically, total deposits and total withdrawals in a year."" The government says that having summary information about annual aggregate deposits and withdrawals (the Treasury Department describes them as inflows and outflows) will help flag when high-income people under-report their income and under-pay their tax obligations. The new rules aren’t a new tax, as some people have suggested, but they do make it easier for the IRS to identify people who might not be paying their proper share of federal taxes. ""When you have a taxpayer who reports $10K of income but has $10M of deposits, that is a taxpayer the IRS can prioritize looking into,"" the department wrote in its email. The proposal has received pushback from the banking industry, which has been critical of additional compliance costs and burdens in the past. Current tax law already requires everyone to pay taxes on income of more than $600, regardless of where it comes from. So, this change is an effort to reduce the country’s estimated $600 billion tax gap (the difference between taxes that are due and taxes that are paid). The Treasury Department estimates, if implemented, the proposed changes would raise approximately $460 billion over 10 years.  Much of the discussion about cash apps like PayPal and Venmo come from a different, already passed proposal. The American Rescue Plan Act, passed by Congress on March 11, includes a new rule that applies to business transactions over $600, which are often paid through cash apps like Venmo, PayPal and Zelle. This applies to third-party apps and credit card issuers, but not traditional bank accounts, experts said.  ""These information reports by PayPal, Venmo and other third-party networks have been on the books for several years, but the threshold for reporting was very high — $20,000 transactions with a 200-transaction minimum,"" said Steven Rosenthal, senior fellow at Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ""It’s just the tracking information on tax rules that have changed.""   Those who use cash apps to avoid traditional forms of income reporting will be most affected by the change, not people who use these platforms for personal, day-to-day transactions. Identifying income through apps like Venmo has become a difficult and opaque process for the government. Businesses and independent sellers who use cash apps have largely been able to fly under the radar with regard to how much income they really bring in each year.  While cash app users who have received more than $600 via the platform might receive a 1099-K form, this doesn’t mean it needs to be filled out or reported — unless it’s business income. For instance, if you sell a piece of furniture for $800 and the buyer pays you on Venmo, it’s not considered taxable income as long as you can prove with a receipt that you originally paid more than $800 for it. ""I don’t expect to receive a 1099-K on grocery transactions,"" Rosenthal said, ""and I think we are still waiting on Venmo and the like to determine the standards of how they will sort through what will need to be reported. But either way, I’m not afraid because it’s not taxable income."" Asked about her claim, Owens said she stands by her tweet and was unswayed by the Treasury Department’s statement that it is not seeking detailed information about individual transactions. ""(They) are looking to expand reporting procedures beyond the current scope,"" Owens wrote in an email to PolitiFact. She said they want ""the institutions to report to them totals — inclusive of those which fall outside of their current purview (Venmo, PayPal, etc). This is a major expansion as typically, the income reported includes what the IRS already has access to — beyond that falls onto the individual taxpayers to self-report.""  Owens tweeted that the Biden administration ""is attempting to empower the IRS to monitor every single withdrawal, deposit, and transaction you make from your personal banking accounts, PayPal, Venmo, etc.."" This is misleading. The American Rescue Plan Act has a provision that will require cash apps like Venmo, PayPal and Zelle to file information reports with both the merchants who use their platforms and the IRS specifically for business transactions that exceed $600. This applies to third-party apps and credit card issuers, not traditional bank accounts. The Biden administration proposal loops traditional bank accounts in, both business and personal. If implemented as is, the change would require financial institutions and cash apps to report to the IRS aggregate inflow and outflow from most bank, loan and investment accounts that exceed $600. But it would not monitor or share details on individual transactions, as Owens’ statement suggests. We rate this Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097033EC0>],/factchecks/2021/oct/11/candace-owens/will-irs-track-every-venmo-transaction-fact-checki/

Southwest, airline pilots union deny claims that anti-vaccine walkouts prompted cancellations
","In separate statements to the press, Southwest Airlines and the union representing its pilots denied the widespread internet rumors that claimed the airline canceled thousands of flights because crew members walked off the job or called in sick to protest the company’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate. Southwest canceled more than 1,000 flights scheduled for Sunday, Oct. 10, according to FlightAware, a flight-tracking service, even as competing airlines called off relatively few flights. Between the evening of Friday, Oct. 8, and the morning of Monday, Oct. 11, the Dallas-based airline dropped more than 2,000 flights nationwide, the Dallas Morning News reported. The airline said that air traffic control issues and weather challenges in Florida disrupted flights on Oct. 8, setting off a cascade of cancellations and delays nationwide that compounded as the airline scrambled to recover from crews, aircrafts and customers that were displaced. But the cancellations occurred shortly after the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association petitioned a court to temporarily block the company’s COVID-19 vaccine mandate, prompting speculation among some social media users that the flights were dropped not because of bad weather or other issues, but because Southwest pilots staged a walkout or sickout in a protest against the mandate. The unsubstantiated posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)   An Oct. 10 tweet claiming Southwest Airlines cancellations were due to pilot walkouts in protest of a COVID-19 vaccine mandate. ""Countless Southwest Airlines employees have walked out of their jobs to oppose the vaccine mandate, causing operations to effectively shut down,"" said one Oct. 10 tweet. ""Southwest is canceling flights and blaming the weather because their employees are saying NO to the authoritarian vaccine mandate,"" said another post on Instagram. ""Pilots are using their sick time before they are terminated on Nov. 24 due to the (vaccine) mandate,"" said a post on Facebook. The posts received hundreds of thousands of engagements across Facebook and Instagram, according to CrowdTangle, a social media insights tool. They were buoyed by conservative influencers such as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, who tweeted that the cancellations were President Joe Biden’s ""vaccine mandate at work."" (The CNBC report Cruz shared with his tweet included a statement from a Southwest spokesperson calling that rumor ""inaccurate"" and ""unfounded."") But the posts were refuted by several key groups, including the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. The union said in an Oct. 9 statement, ""We can say with confidence that our pilots are not participating in any official or unofficial job actions."" In a second statement Oct. 10, the union’s president, Casey Murray, addressed the rumors more directly: ""There are false claims of job actions by Southwest pilots currently gaining traction on social media and making their way into mainstream news. I can say with certainty that there are no work slowdowns or sickouts either related to the recent mandatory vaccine mandate or otherwise. Under the (Railway Labor Act), our Union is forbidden from taking job action to resolve labor disputes under these circumstances. SWAPA has not authorized, and will not condone, any job action. ""SWA has claimed that the immediate causes of this weekend’s meltdown were staffing at Jacksonville Center and weather in the southeast U.S., but what was a minor temporary event for other carriers devastated Southwest Airlines because our operation has become brittle and subject to massive failures under the slightest pressure."" The union said Oct. 5 that it is not against vaccines, but it decided to take legal action against Southwest’s requirement because the airline made the decision without negotiating. Murray told the Dallas Morning News that the data showed that pilot sick rates during the heavy cancellation days were ""exactly in line with where they were all summer with the same kind of operational disasters."" ""The weekend challenges were not a result of employee demonstrations, as some have reported,"" Southwest Airlines added in an Oct. 11 statement to PolitiFact. RELATED VIDEO The airline said its operations were returning to normal. It pinned the weekend cancellations on the weather and air traffic control issues in Florida the evening of Oct. 8, saying the combination ""created significant flight disruptions throughout our network and we spent the weekend working to recover from the high number of displaced crews, aircraft, and customers.""  Similarly, the Federal Aviation Administration tweeted that there have been no air traffic staffing shortages reported since Oct. 8 — contradicting related social media rumors, which claimed air traffic controllers had also staged walkouts or sickouts to protest the vaccine mandates. An FAA spokesperson told PolitiFact that any staffing issues would be seen on the agency’s website.’ The FAA’s tweet said the problems the evening of Oct. 8 were ""due to widespread severe weather, military training, & limited staffing in one area of the Jacksonville en route center."" The chief operating officer of the Jacksonville Aviation Authority also refuted the rumor about a walkout led by air traffic controllers in an internal email, which was obtained by a local reporter. The COO said the Jacksonville staff was limited Oct. 8 because of a combination of controllers who were on normal, approved leave, or at home because they had just been vaccinated. On Twitter, Southwest initially attributed the dropped flights to ""(air traffic control) issues and disruptive weather,"" although other airlines did not have to cancel nearly as many flights. In an Oct. 10 memo to Southwest employees, Alan Kasher, Southwest’s executive vice president of daily operations, described a domino effect triggered by the problems from that evening.  In this frame grab from cellphone video, passengers look for information on their flights on Oct. 10, 2021, at Dallas Love Field. (AP) A delay or a cancellation in one place can cause a delay or a cancellation elsewhere, as pilots, flight attendants and planes get displaced and struggle to stay on schedule. That can snowball to create further staffing shortages as flight crews time out and can’t operate planned flights.  There are fewer flight options than usual to reroute crews and passengers who encounter problems, Kasher said.  Southwest had been slated to run its highest number of scheduled flights on Oct. 10 since the start of the coronavirus pandemic, the Dallas Morning News reported. After the disruptions on Oct. 8, the airline cancelled more than 800 flights on Oct. 9, and then over 1,000 on Oct. 10. Similar issues plagued airlines over the summer. Social media users claimed that widespread cancellations from Spirit Airlines and American Airlines in August were the result of walkouts from crew members protesting the vaccine mandates. PolitiFact rated those claims False. A tweet said, ""Countless Southwest Airlines employees have walked out of their jobs to oppose the vaccine mandate, causing operations to effectively shut down."" The claim — along with other variations circulating online — is unsubstantiated. Southwest and the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association denied that Southwest pilots led any such walkout or sickout to protest the vaccine mandate. They attributed the flight cancellations to other factors, including bad weather and other issues on Friday that prompted a wave of cancellations. Without evidence, we rate this claim False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280968ABD00>],/factchecks/2021/oct/11/tweets/southwest-airline-pilots-union-deny-claims-anti-va/

Bill Gates didn’t say he wanted to use vaccines to reduce the population
","Over the years, many claims have misrepresented Bill Gates’ views on how expanding access to health care — including vaccines — will lead people to have smaller families. An Oct. 6 article published on the website Tech Startups added a new claim to the list by alleging that 11 years ago, Bill Gates talked about reducing the global population by 10% to 15% ""using new vaccines for population control."" ""Bill Gates talked about using vaccines to control population growth, here is the unedited 2010 TED Talk video,"" the headline said. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  TechStartups included a YouTube clip of Gates’ 2010 TEDTalk presentation called ""Innovating to zero!"" His presentation focused on lowering carbon dioxide emissions down to zero.  In the clip, Gates introduces a mathematical equation to calculate the amount of global emissions and how to lower it. Part of that equation included the size of the global population.  ""The world today has 6.8 billion people. That's headed up to about 9 billion,"" Gates said. ""Now, if we do a really great job on new vaccines, health care, reproductive health services, we could lower that by, perhaps, 10 or 15%."" The full video is 27 minutes and available on the TEDTalk website. Gates’ comment about the population was a fragment of his speech. He spoke largely about the types of energy and actions that produce CO2, and proposed a solution of energy measures, like nuclear, wind and solar, that would reduce carbon dioxide emissions a great deal by 2050. His point about vaccines has been commonly misconstrued as a plot to depopulate the planet. In 2018, PolitiFact debunked a similar claim. Melinda Gates wrote this in the former couple's annual letter: ""When more children live past age five, and when mothers can decide if and when to have children, population sizes don’t go up. They go down. Parents have fewer children when they’re confident those children will survive into adulthood. Big families are in some ways an insurance policy against the tragic likelihood of losing a son or a daughter."" Bill Gates further outlined the idea in a separate video, showing a chart that illustrated the inclining growth rate of the world’s population and the effect of improving health care.  ""What we found is that as health improves, families choose to have less children, and this effect is very, very dramatic,"" Gates said. ""We find that in every country of the world, this is repeated.""   A website article claimed that Bill Gates advocated for reducing the global population by using vaccines during a 2010 TedTalk. Gates wasn’t talking about reducing the population through vaccination. He and his former wife Melinda have repeatedly said that child mortality is lowered when families have access to life-saving vaccines and health care, allowing families to choose to have fewer children.

Rick Scott wrongly warns FBI coming after loud parents at school board meetings
","Mainly due to mask mandates, once sleepy school board discussions of budgets and facility management have become noisy events that draw hundreds of angry parents. From Washington state to Georgia, strong feelings about COVID-19 policies have driven most of the debate, but in some places, disagreements over schools’ policies on race, history and equality have been just as vehement. In one instance, demonstrators surrounded a school board member’s car, preventing him from driving away. After one Illinois school board meeting, police arrested an Illinois man for disorderly conduct and aggravated battery. The National School Boards Association asked the Biden administration for help with threats, and U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland fired off a Justice Department memo to focus on the issue. Florida Republican Sen. Rick Scott was quick to respond. ""Joe Biden’s attorney general wants the FBI to go after parents for speaking out at school board meetings to protect kids from radical curriculum like critical race theory,"" Scott tweeted Oct. 5. (The discussion of race in schools has drawn charges of indoctrination, often under the umbrella term of critical race theory, a school of thought that focuses on systemic, rather than overt, discrimination.) Joe Biden’s attorney general wants the @FBI to go after parents for speaking out at school board meetings to protect kids from radical curriculum like critical race theory.Biden’s disgusting socialist agenda must end. We won’t let him intimidate & silence parents. We’ll compare Garland’s memo to Scott’s claim that this is an effort ""to go after parents for speaking out at school board meetings."" And we’ll explore what the law has to say about the line between free speech and behavior that breaks the law. On Oct. 4, Garland sent a memo to the FBI, every U.S. attorney and the Justice Department’s Criminal Division. ""In recent months, there has been a disturbing spike in harassment, intimidation, and threats of violence against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff who participate in the vital work of running our nation's public schools,"" Garland wrote Oct. 4. ""While spirited debate about policy matters is protected under our Constitution, that protection does not extend to threats of violence or efforts to intimidate individuals based on their views."" Garland told the FBI to hold meetings across the country and bring together leaders at all levels of government to discuss ""strategies for addressing threats against school administrators, board members, teachers, and staff, and (to) open dedicated lines of communication for threat reporting, assessment, and response."" The focus, Garland said, is on criminal conduct. Justice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle said nothing in Garland’s memo amounted to an ""effort to silence those with particular views about COVID-related policies, school curricula, or other topics of public discussion."" ""The department’s efforts are about rooting out criminal threats of violence, not about any particular ideology,"" Hornbuckle said. We reached out to Scott’s office and did not hear back. We heard from four law professors who specialize in the First Amendment and freedom of speech. Of the four, Eugene Volokh at the University of California Los Angeles voiced the most concern with Garland’s orders. ""The First Amendment does not protect true threats of violence,"" Volokh said. ""But Garland mentioned harassment and intimidation. If he had stopped with criminal threats, we would agree. But I’ve seen the terms ‘harassment’ and ‘intimidation’ used very broadly. I can see someone at a meeting worrying that if they get up too often, or they say too much, they might be charged."" RELATED VIDEO Volokh cited cases where charges have been made, and thrown out, against people for harassment. In one 2020 case, the federal government charged a Mississippi man, Christopher Cook, with internet harassment (technically, cyberstalking) after he used his Facebook account to accuse state agents, judges and others of framing him for drug charges. The U.S. District Court ruled against the government, saying nothing reached the level of a ""true threat."" The man never directly contacted anyone, nor did he explicitly state he intended physical harm. To Volokh, this shows the legal risk a parent might face if they sound off against school board members. Or nearly as bad, in Volokh’s view, a parent might fear they face that risk, and so, not speak out. Gregory Magarian, professor of law at Washington University in St. Louis School of Law, said Scott’s tweet doesn’t track with Garland’s instructions. ""The attorney general’s statement specifically acknowledges that the First Amendment protects political debate, or what Sen. Scott refers to as ‘speaking out,’"" Magarian said. ""Nothing in the attorney general’s statement suggests any affirmative reason to worry about overly broad enforcement. If federal or state law enforcement does engage in overly broad speech restriction, the First Amendment overbreadth doctrine provides the remedy."" In jurisprudence, ""true threat"" has a specific meaning. ""Vociferous dissenting speech at a school board meeting is protected,"" said law professor Douglas Laycock at the University of Virginia School of Law, who voiced no opinion on Garland’s memo itself. ""Disrupting the meeting and making it impossible to continue probably is not. Threatening the school board with physical violence definitely is not."" About 45 years ago, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit came up with a fairly specific test of what constitutes a true threat. It’s a threat that ""on its face and in the circumstances in which it is made is so unequivocal, unconditional, immediate, and specific as to the person threatened, as to convey a gravity of purpose and imminent prospect of execution.""  Magarian noted that Garland’s memo does not promise much specific action.  ""It only mandates the discussion of strategies for addressing threats and opening dedicated lines of communication for threat reporting, assessment, and response,"" Magarian said. ""Whether or how any government will ‘go after’ anyone remains entirely conjectural."" In the cases Volokh shared, the courts slapped down overzealous government prosecutors. To Volokh, that shows that the government can go too far. To others, the results show the limits the government faces. ""If the Justice Department tried to stretch intimidation to cover any hostile speech, they should lose, and almost certainly would lose,"" Laycock said. Scott said that ""Joe Biden’s attorney general wants the FBI to go after parents for speaking out at school board meetings to protect kids from radical curriculum like critical race theory."" Attorney General Garland specifically said that ""spirited debate"" is protected. His memo targeted threats that go beyond passionate speech, and said nothing about critical race theory. The line between sincere debate and words that intimidate isn’t always clear, and there is a concern that officials might apply an overly broad interpretation. In the past, courts have ruled against that sort of loose approach to defining what constitutes a threat. Nothing in Garland’s memo says that is part of the plan.

Claim that Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine is not ‘guaranteed’ after 6 months misleads
","Wait — Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccine came with a guarantee? No.  And a claim made by conservative commentator Kimberly Klacik suggesting that the vaccine loses all its effectiveness over time is wrong. Klacik, a Republican who lost her 2020 campaign for a U.S. House seat from Baltimore, made the claim on Instagram, where she has 530,000 followers. She referred to New York City’s requirement to show proof of vaccination to enter some venues, writing: ""So now that it’s been confirmed that the Pfizer vaccine isn’t guaranteed after 6 months, are the bulk of the vaccination cards NYC requires expired? Proving your #COVID vaccination status has become one of the dumbest ideas in US history."" Her post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Let’s first dismiss the notion that advocates of vaccination say that COVID-19 vaccines come with any guarantee. ""COVID-19 vaccines are effective and are a critical tool to bring the pandemic under control; however, no vaccine is 100% effective at preventing illness,"" the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says. ""Some fully vaccinated people will get sick, and some will even be hospitalized or die from COVID-19."" Now let’s get to how the Pfizer vaccine loses some, but not all, effectiveness over time. When we asked Klacik to back up her statement, she said multiple reports, including a Reuters news story, stated that the vaccine ""loses its effectiveness after six months."" The Reuters story said the vaccine’s effectiveness drops after six months. The study, funded by Pfizer and peer reviewed, was published Oct. 4 in The Lancet, a British medical journal. Researchers led by an epidemiologist at Kaiser Permanente Southern California health care system studied the Pfizer vaccine’s effectiveness. They analyzed the electronic health records of more than 3 million patients ages 12 and up in the system, from Dec. 14, 2020, to Aug. 8, 2021. The study was designed to assess the effectiveness of the vaccine against infection and hospitalizations for up to six months. Key findings:  The vaccine is 90% effective against hospital admissions for up to six months, at least.  Effectiveness against infection dropped from 88% to 47% after five months. Waning effectiveness was expected, the study said, based on other studies. Reduction in vaccine effectiveness against infections over time ""is probably primarily due to waning immunity with time, rather than the delta variant escaping vaccine protection."" This and other studies ""suggest that booster doses are likely to be needed to restore the initial high amounts of protection observed early in the vaccination program."" The study underscores ""the importance of continuing to prioritize improving COVID-19 vaccination rates, including in hard-to-reach communities."" Klacik said ""it's been confirmed that the Pfizer"" COVID-19 ""vaccine isn't guaranteed after six months"" and suggested it loses all effectiveness. The vaccine never came with any guarantee.  Klacik’s claim alludes to a study that found that the Pfizer vaccine’s effectiveness in preventing infection dropped from 88% to 47% after five months. In preventing hospital admission, the vaccine remained 90% effective over six months, the study found.  The claim contains only an element of truth.

But PolitiFact found no evidence that Facebook planted Haugen to pretend to speak out as a whistleblower — a claim that Facebook told us was not true.  An Oct. 5 Facebook post accused Facebook of ""planting"" whistleblower Frances Haugen. Haugen, 37, left Facebook in May after nearly two years with the company. She was recruited to the social media giant as a product manager on the civic misinformation team, according to her recently created website. She previously worked for Google, Pinterest and Yelp. In her final days at Facebook, Haugen parsed through internal company documents, copies of which she later provided to Wall Street Journal reporter Jeff Horwitz, who covers technology.  The documents formed the basis for the newspaper’s multi-part series, the Facebook Files, which reported on Facebook’s tiered system for elites who violate platform policies, Instagram’s impact on teenage girls’ mental health and body image, and other revelations. ""We are confident in the legitimacy of our sourcing and rigorous vetting of the documents, and we stand by our reporting,"" said Wall Street Journal spokesperson Steve Severinghaus. Horwitz first heard from Haugen late in 2020, and their reporter-source relationship spanned 10 months, during which time Horwitz referred to her by the pseudonym ""Sean."" Haugen used the same alias in communications with lawyers at Whistleblower Aid, a nonprofit that represents people reporting corporate and government misbehavior, the New York Times reported. Haugen filed at least eight whistleblower complaints with the Securities and Exchange Commission based on the documents she gathered, according to ""60 Minutes.""  She also testified about her role and experience at Facebook before Congress. ""I saw Facebook repeatedly encounter conflicts between its own profit and our safety. Facebook consistently resolved these conflicts in favor of its own profits,"" Haugen said in her Oct. 5 testimony. In response, Facebook said in a statement that she ""worked for the company for less than two years, had no direct reports, never attended a decision-point meeting with C-level executives — and testified more than six times to not working on the subject matter in question."" Facebook and CEO Mark Zuckerberg have also disputed some claims made by Haugen and the Wall Street Journal in various statements.

No, Donald Trump didn’t lead ‘greatest economy in the history of the world’
","Fans of former President Donald Trump have been sharing a post on social media that pines for the economy during his tenure.  The text-only post says, ""In case you forgot. Two years ago today, we were experiencing the greatest economy in the history of the world.""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The message of these posts is a drastic overstatement, economists say, whether you look at just U.S. history or all of world history.  While the U.S. economy prior to the pandemic was in many ways stronger than it is today, we found general agreement that there’s no support for the argument that it was ""the greatest economy in the history of the world."" We looked at a similar claim just over a year ago, made by Trump himself, and rated it False. The strongest evidence in favor of the claim is the unemployment rate. On Trump’s watch, the unemployment rate plunged to levels that it hasn’t touched since the early 1950s. It appears to be the lowest peacetime unemployment rate over a three-year period, going back to the Great Depression, said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.   In this achievement, Trump benefited from the continuation of trends that had been in place under the Obama recovery.  ""While Trump can take some credit, I see it like the relief pitcher who comes in during the 9th inning with a seven-run lead, then boasts about winning the game,"" Dean Baker, co-founder of the liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research, told PolitiFact last year. ""It’s fine to get some credit for holding the lead, but this is much more an Obama story than a Trump story."" By contrast, growth in the nation’s gross domestic product — probably the single most important statistic used to gauge the overall strength of the economy — was so-so on Trump’s watch.    The annual increases in GDP under Trump were broadly similar to what they were during the final six years under his predecessor, Barack Obama. And GDP growth under Trump was well below that of prior presidents. If you adjust GDP to take account of population, the picture remains weak for the economy under Trump. Calculations by Burtless found that inflation-adjusted GDP per capita prior to the pandemic increased 1.9% annually under Trump, which makes this three-year period the 16th highest among the past 30 non-overlapping three-year periods — right about average compared with his predecessors. Economists added a couple other factors that cast doubt on the supremacy of the economy under Trump. One is wages. Adjusted for inflation, wages that began rising during the Obama years continued to increase under Trump. But these inflation-adjusted wage increases were modest compared with the 2% a year seen in the 1960s. ""This is not what you would expect with a 3.5% unemployment rate,"" Baker said, alluding to the pre-pandemic rate of February 2020.  In addition, federal deficits relative to GDP have historically fallen during ""great"" economic periods, such as the 1960s and the late 1990s, when unemployment rates weren’t much higher than what the U.S. experienced before the pandemic, said Steve Fazzari, an economist at Washington University in St. Louis.  By contrast, under Trump, the federal budget deficit widened even before the pandemic hit. Another factor undermining the claim about Trump’s economy is that the Federal Reserve was feeding the economy with historically low interest rates — rates on par with what the Fed usually enacts during poor economic times to revive the economy. In fact, the Fed went so far as to interrupt its plan to ""normalize"" interest rates by stopping interest-rate increases in early 2019, and it began cutting rates in August 2019, well before the pandemic. (The Trump administration made it clear that it wanted to keep rates low.) This ""certainly contradicts the assessment of the economy as being ‘great,’"" Fazzari said. Burtless also looked at the growth rate in personal consumption per person, adjusted for inflation — a metric that for many families is the bottom line of economic activity, determining how much they can spend on food, clothing, housing, health care, and travel.  In Trump’s three years in office through January 2020, real consumption per person grew by 2% a year. Of the 30 non-overlapping three-year periods since 1929, this ranks Trump 12th from the bottom. It’s worth noting that presidents can have an impact on economic conditions, but they are not the only factor. Oil price fluctuations, changes in technology and the state of the global economy are among the things outside of their control. In Trump’s case, even the things he did, such as a major tax bill in 2017, had ""disappointing"" results for economic growth, Fazzari said. Specifically, Fazzari pointed to the inflation-adjusted rate of nonresidential private fixed investment, which measures purchases of such items as nonresidential structures, equipment and software. This metric rose for a while after the tax cut passed, but since then has been on a downward trend and actually went negative in late 2019 before collapsing during the pandemic.   Facebook posts said, ""In case you forgot. Two years ago today, we were experiencing the greatest economy in the history of the world."" Economists offer multiple data points that undermine this assertion. While unemployment was near historical lows under Trump, growth in gross domestic product was well below what previous presidents achieved, and other metrics such as wages and business investment ranged from decent to mediocre. We rate the statement False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280971C41C0>],/factchecks/2021/oct/08/facebook-posts/no-donald-trump-didnt-lead-greatest-economy-histor/

Not only that, McCrory suggests that some of the money owed to farmers has instead gone to special interest groups that are attacking his campaign for U.S. Senate. Yes, there is a lot to unpack here. Let’s start with the basics.  McCrory, former governor of North Carolina, is one of several Republicans now running for the U.S. Senate. The opponent in McCrory’s crosshairs is U.S. Rep. Ted Budd, who was endorsed by former President Donald Trump and is seen as one of the stronger candidates in the race. During Pete Kaliner’s radio show on Sept. 17, McCrory said that the Budd family is under scrutiny for its involvement in a seed company called AgriBioTech, which ultimately declared bankruptcy. The Washington Post wrote a detailed story about the settlement, and other media outlets followed-up with their own stories about the controversy. McCrory accurately pointed out that the company repaid a $10 million loan from the Budd family shortly before going bankrupt. He accused them of ""ripping off farmers."" Then he said this: ""How did the Budd family somehow recover and pay off all their loans before the bankruptcy, and then lose a civil court case about this?"" he said.  While judges did rule against the Budd family, the legal battles technically ended because the parties involved settled out of court. But here’s the part of McCrory’s statement that we wanted to fact-check: ""And, you know, some of that same money now that was made is being used on TV ads against me, because the Budd family also helps give donations to these Washington special interest groups that are running negative ads against me in the Senate race."" Here, McCrory suggests that the Budd family: Made money through the AgriBioTech loan repayment Donated that money to ""special interest groups"" And that the special interest groups are using the Budd family money to run negative ads against him. Is that all true? McCrory is drawing some long, squiggly lines to try to connect those dots. McCrory referred to money ""that was made"" from the AgriBioTech settlement. But it’s not clear the family ""made"" much money at all. Budd’s father, Richard, agreed to take over as chief executive in March 1999 as AgriBioTech struggled. Shortly thereafter, Richard Budd secured a $10 million loan that he then transferred to the company. Ted Budd signed as one of 11 ""co-makers"" of the loan, allowing his stock to be used as collateral, campaign spokesman Jonathan Felts said. The company repaid the loan to the family, then declared bankruptcy seven months later. The federal government estimated the bankruptcy left $50 million in payments undelivered to farmers and others. These details all come from the Washington Post report. Other creditors sued, saying the company should’ve paid them before repaying the Budd loan. They also alleged that Richard Budd improperly transferred assets to his family, including Ted. (The family denies these claims.) A federal bankruptcy judge in 2005 ruled that Richard Budd would have to repay $15 million, a figure that accounted for the original loan plus interest and other costs. The two sides settled the case out of court later that year, with ""Budd entities"" agreeing to pay about $6 million.  So let’s recap. The Budd family loaned AgriBioTech $10 million. The company then repaid the loan with $25,234 interest, the Post reported. Creditors sued. Then Budd ""entities"" agreed to repay about $6 million, leaving them with about $4 million.  In the end, there was no admission of wrongdoing. The money AgriBioTech distributed to the Budd family was repaid to the bank that issued the initial loan, Budd spokesman Felts told PolitiFact. Meanwhile, ""Richard Budd and his family never sold their ABT stock so they lost all of that investment when the company went bankrupt,"" Felts said. Should the money that AgriBioTech paid to the Budds have gone to farmers instead? People are free to debate. Did the Budd family ""make"" money off their loan to AgriBioTech? That seems like a stretch.  Now, who are the ""special interests"" using Budd money to attack McCrory? Club for Growth Action, a conservative PAC, has endorsed Budd and is running negative ads against McCrory. When we reached out to McCrory about his comments, campaign spokesman Jordan Shaw pointed out that Budd’s family has donated both to Budd’s campaign and Club for Growth. However, the donations Shaw cited were given years before Budd announced his run for Senate. Richard Budd and Joe Budd, Ted’s brother, have donated a combined $70,000 to Club for Growth Action. Each donated $25,000 in 2016 and $10,000 in 2018, according to Federal Election Commission records.  While McCrory singled-out ""Washington special interest groups"" in his interview with Kaliner, his spokesman added that Budd is also receiving donations from family members and people connected to AgriBioTech. Shaw noted that Budd loaned himself $250,000, FEC records show. He also claimed that Budd has received donations for former AgriBioTech executives. PolitiFact NC asked Shaw for evidence that the money AgriBioTech paid the Budd family was the money donated to Club For Growth. After all, the family members could have used funds of their own that they earned or acquired through other means. Shaw said McCrory’s broader point is that the Budd family accumulated ""wealth"" through AgriBioTech, and is now using some of it to fund attack ads.  Ultimately, though, there’s no way for Shaw to know whether the money Budd’s father and brother donated years ago was used on ads against McCrory. Club for Growth Action doesn’t exactly need to look beneath its couch cushions for old donations. The group announced in June that it had raised $5.1 million to support Budd’s Senate campaign, and that it plans to raise more. McCrory said the Budd family ""made"" money by having its loan repaid by AgriBioTech. There are several reasons available evidence doesn’t support that. The Budd family loaned the company $10 million, got about $10 million back, then had to repay $6 million of it.  So, in a vacuum, the family is down about $6 million. Now, it would be hypothetically possible for the Budd family (or anyone who’s fiscally savvy) to take that $10 million repayment, invest it wisely, and have it grow — all before having to repay $6 million. However, Budd’s spokesman says the family used the money to repay the bank. Budd’s father and brother have donated money to Club for Growth Action, a group that’s now running attack ads against the former governor. But the donations were made in 2016 and 2018, years before Budd decided to run for senate. So it’s highly unlikely those donations, specifically, are being used against McCrory now. McCrory’s statement contains an element of truth -- the Budd family has, in the past, contributed to a political group that is now running ads against McCrory. But it ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. That’s our definition of Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C2E0D80>],/factchecks/2021/oct/08/pat-mccrory/mccrory-tries-connect-budd-family-agribiotech-sett/

Social media posts wrong about “cow fart tax”
","As congressional Democrats seek to assemble legislation enacting President Joe Biden’s policy agenda, critics have taken to social media to attack what they say is one of its provisions: Hundreds or even thousands of dollars in new methane emissions taxes on each head of cattle and hogs. One representative post from Sept. 27 said, ""Were you aware the $3.5 Trillion Human Infrastructure package includes an animal agriculture tax of $2,600!! per head of cattle? $500 for swine!!! People it’s time to make some noise!!! This will destroy us all!! No cows no swine no meat!!!""  As evidence, the post includes a photograph of a newspaper op-ed written by Rep. Markwayne Mullin, R-Okla. (although the newspaper piece’s byline misspells the congressman’s name as ""Mullins"").  In the op-ed, Mullin calls the Democrats’ proposed $3.5 trillion ""human infrastructure"" bill ""a blank check for socialism."" ""In an attempt to eliminate fossil fuels, this legislation would impose a 'fee' on all methane emissions, including in our agriculture industry,"" Mullin wrote. He went on to specify costs of $6,500 per dairy cow, $2,600 per head of cattle, and $500 per swine. Similar posts were shared by thousands of users. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) PolitiFact confirmed that there is no new animal methane tax, and there’s no sign it’s even under consideration. Instead, it’s a misinterpretation of an entirely separate policy proposal.  ""There is no ‘cow fart tax,’"" said John Buhl, senior communications manager at the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center. ""It does not exist."" A pig looks out of its pen at a hog feeding operation near Tribune, Kan. (AP) Meredith Blanford, a spokesperson for Mullin, said the op-ed was referring to legislative language considered by the House Energy and Commerce Committee that would levy a methane tax on oil and gas producers. The provision would tax oil and gas producers $1,500 per metric ton of methane emitted above a threshold. Methane is a contributor to climate change, and environmentalists have sought to curb its release into the atmosphere. Methane is ""the source of one-third of U.S. methane emissions,"" said Frank Mitloehner, a professor and air quality extension specialist in the University of California-Davis animal science department. ""Getting methane right and not using food as a political football is critical to climate science."" When the committee took up the provision, Republicans offered an amendment to exempt livestock from being caught up in enforcement of the methane provision targeted on oil and gas. ""While the language specifies the oil and gas industry, it also references EPA’s greenhouse gas inventory and leaves too much room for the EPA to expand its regulatory reach,"" Blanford said. The amendment failed, with Democrats arguing that it was unnecessary because the provision was explicitly targeted toward fossil fuels, not agriculture. Blanford said the numbers listed in the op-ed came from an analysis by the American Farm Bureau Federation, an agriculture advocacy group. But the group has since clarified that its analysis was theoretical and not descriptive of actual legislation that targeted agricultural emissions. The federation’s communications director, Mike Tomko, told PolitiFact that the data came from an analysis conducted by the group’s economists this past summer, ""to determine the potential impact if agriculture were to be included in legislation imposing a methane fee similar to legislative proposals aimed at oil and gas."" However, Tomko added that ""the current language"" of the bill ""does not impose a methane tax on agriculture."" Two days after the interview, the federation released a public statement reiterating this point, ""to clear up any confusion."" The National Cattlemen’s Beef Association concurred in a statement to USA Today. ""Ultimately, the rumors relative to a potential cow tax are just that — rumors,"" said Danielle Beck, the group’s senior executive director of government affairs. ""And we view it as an unhelpful distraction from the issues at hand."" To further remove any doubt, the Senate on Aug. 10 passed an amendment sponsored by Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, related to ""prohibiting or limiting the issuance of costly Clean Air Act permit requirements on farmers and ranchers in the United States or the imposition of new federal methane requirements on livestock."" The amendment passed, 66-33, with 17 Democrats joining Republicans in voting for it. That was more than two weeks before the Facebook post went public. A Facebook post said, ""Were you aware the $3.5 Trillion Human Infrastructure package includes an animal agriculture tax of $2,600!! per head of cattle? $500 for swine!!!"" Democrats are considering a legislative proposal to tax methane emissions by oil and gas producers as a way of curbing climate change, but the proposal was not written to apply to methane released by livestock operations. Two leading agriculture groups have explicitly said that there’s no agricultural methane tax proposal under serious consideration, and the Senate passed an amendment to rule out a methane emissions tax on agriculture. We rate the statement False.

Joe Biden largely right that share of U.S. women in workforce now lags other nations
","During a visit to Howell, Mich., President Joe Biden touted key agenda items under negotiation in Congress. One of the proposals he wants to see receive final Congressional approval is support for child care, which he said would benefit both children and their parents, including mothers who want to take jobs outside the home. ""How can we compete in the world if millions of American parents, especially moms, can’t join the workforce because they can’t afford the cost of child care or elder care? They have to stay home,"" Biden said in the Oct. 5 speech.  He went on to say that the United States had fallen behind its industrialized peers in the percentage of women in the labor force. ""Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce,"" Biden said. ""You know where we are today? Twenty-three. Twenty-two countries have a higher percentage of their women in the workforce making a competitive wage than the United States. While our competitors are investing in the care economy, we’re standing still."" Has the United States really fallen so far behind in women’s participation in the labor force? Our research shows it has. We asked the White House for a source, and they pointed to data from the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, a think tank that studies advanced industrialized nations. The data broadly supports how Biden characterized the shifts between 1990 and 2020. There are multiple ways to measure the phenomenon Biden addressed — notably, what age ranges are used. If you look at the labor force participation rate for all women at least 15 years of age, the United States ranked seventh in 1990, behind Denmark, Sweden, Estonia, Finland, Norway and Canada. But by 2020, the United States’ ranking had fallen to 17th. (Labor force participation rate refers to the percentage of a given group that is either employed or is actively seeking work.) An alternative statistic — the labor force participation rate for women in the prime working ages of 25 to 54 — shows an even steeper U.S. decline. In 1990, the United States ranked seventh, behind the same six countries. But by 2020, the U.S. had fallen to 31st.  The White House used a slightly different version of the OECD data than we did, which accounts for the differences in the U.S. rankings. But multiple economists told us that the differences in rankings were minor, and that the trend line was much more important. Specifically, the U.S. percentage of women working basically stagnated over those 30 years, even as 13 nations leapfrogged the U.S. between 1990 and 2020: Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom.   ""However you define it, I think the president is highlighting genuine trends,"" said Gary Burtless, an economist with the Brookings Institution.   Historically, women in the U.S. gravitated to the labor force earlier than women in other countries did. Right after World War II, only about one-third of U.S. women were in the labor force, but by the late 1990s, that percentage had risen steeply, to the low-60% range. Since then, however, it has plateaued and even fallen modestly overall.   By the early 1990s, the United States ranked higher on this measurement than most of its economic peers.  Since the 1990s, the downturn has been driven mostly by ""married women with a college degree, particularly those married to high-earning men,"" said Stefania Albanesi, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh. Albanesi said her research suggests that a rise in earnings of college-educated men, particularly those at the top of the income distribution, has reduced the pressure for married women to take paying work outside the home. As the U.S. rate began to fall, other nations caught up. Several factors drove these international shifts, economists say. One is that women in other countries have belatedly made gains in educational attainment, giving them a boost in the labor market. But perhaps the biggest difference comes from the lack of social policies in the United States that enable women with children to take jobs. The policies that are common in other industrialized countries but not in the U.S. include ""publicly provided child care services, an entitlement to paid parental leave, laws giving workers the right to demand a change to a part-time work schedule without exception and without being discriminated against,"" said Mihaela Pintea, an economist at Florida International University. The upshot of the lack of such policies in the U.S. is that it’s ""costly or burdensome for women with kids to remain in the workforce after they have a child,"" Burtless said.  Claudia Goldin, a Harvard University economist, cautioned that it’s tricky to make cross-national comparisons on labor-force participation. Perhaps the biggest factor complicating Biden’s comparison is that countries define part-time work differently. Generally speaking, when looking only at participation among women who work full-time hours, the U.S. ranks higher in international comparisons, Goldin said. ""If you did this comparison just for full-time work, we’d be up there,"" she said. ""If you weighted by hours, we’d be up there."" Pintea added that, despite grim statistics like those cited by Biden, U.S. women who are working may still be better positioned in some ways. Effectively, the U.S. labor market environment pushes women to either skip working entirely or take a full-time job, rather than finding a middle ground. ""In a lot of other countries, women might work part-time as opposed to full time and may be less likely to be promoted into managerial positions, or may have lower wages than their male counterparts because of their career path,"" she said. Biden said, ""Thirty years ago, the United States ranked sixth among advanced economies in the share of women in the workforce. You know where we are today? Twenty-three."" The specific rankings vary a bit depending on what measure one uses, though by one measurement, the U.S. position is even worse than Biden said. The general conclusion is the same: The United States used to rank near the top of the pack of industrialized countries in women’s participation in the labor force, but over the past 30 years, many other countries have leapfrogged the U.S. in that measurement, as the rate in the U.S. stagnated or even fell. Economists say the U.S. rate has been lagging for several reasons, including a lack of government policies encouraging child care and paid leave and other countries catching up to the United States’ earlier gains in women’s educational attainment.

CDC does not show higher death rate from vaccines than from COVID-19 among kids
","Reacting to news that California will eventually require COVID-19 vaccinations for schoolchildren, a Twitter user claimed that among children, the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have a death rate 174 times higher than for COVID-19 itself. The tweet, with a reference to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, stated: ""CDC numbers reported that among children 5-17 who had COVID-19, there was 1 death per 174,803 cases. Pfizer & Moderna trials w/ children showed 1 death per 1,000 vaccinated. So, California is actually mandating a vaccine w/ a mortality rate 174x higher than the virus."" A reader asked us to check the claim. The CDC has not reported a death rate for children who have received a COVID-19 vaccine as higher than the rate of death for children who are infected by the virus.  In fact, the agency also says there is no clear evidence that any of the three COVID-19 vaccines used in the United States have caused any deaths. The Oct. 1 tweet was made in response to a tweet the same day by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who announced that California would become the first state to mandate COVID-19 vaccines for kids.  Without specifying any vaccines, Newsom referred to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in saying California ""will require our kids to get the COVID-19 vaccine to come to school. This will go into effect following full FDA approval."" The CDC recommends that everyone age 12 and older be vaccinated for COVID-19.  But the FDA has given full approval only to the Pfizer vaccine, now marketed as Comirnaty, and only for people age 16 and over.  The Moderna and Johnson & Johnson vaccines, and the Pfizer vaccine for adolescents age 12 to 15, are being administered through emergency use authorizations given by the FDA.  In the thread to his own tweet, the Twitter user shared a picture of a portion of a document that makes several allegations regarding kids age 12 to 15. It’s not clear what the document is, but it states that trials for the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines each included 1,000 people age 12 to 15; that one 15-year-old died from a Pfizer vaccine and another 15-year-old died from the Pfizer vaccine; and that ""it has to be assumed"" both teens were part of the trials, thereby creating a vaccine-death rate of 1 in 1,000.  The document also alleges that the COVID-19 death rate for the 12-to-15 group is 1 for every 174,803 cases — and so, the vaccine-death rate is 174 times higher than the virus death rate. The data do not bear this out; quite the opposite. The COVID-19 death rate among children is minuscule. As of Sept. 30, 2021, 520 children died from COVID-19 based on reporting from 45 states, according to a report from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association. That’s a death rate of 0.01% per case. And there is no CDC data showing a vaccine death rate higher than a COVID-19 death rate. In vaccine trials, zero deaths were reported among the 1,131 adolescents age 12 to 15 who received the Pfizer vaccine, according to an April 2021 FDA document. Zero deaths also were reported among 2,489 people ages 12 to 17 who received the Moderna vaccine, according to an August 2021 medical journal article.  In July 2021, the CDC reported there were 14 deaths among 8.9 million people age 12 to 17 who received Pfizer vaccinations. None of the deaths were determined to be related to the vaccines, said Dr. Sonja Rasmussen, professor in pediatrics and epidemiology at the University of Florida. There is no clear evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths in the U.S. Researchers are still evaluating whether there is a connection between the Johnson & Johnson vaccine and rare types of blood clots that have led to deaths, but such cases are few. The FDA requires health care providers to report any death after COVID-19 vaccination to the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, jointly run by the CDC and the FDA, even if it’s unclear whether the vaccine was the cause.  More than 390 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines were administered in the United States from Dec. 14, 2020, through Sept. 27, 2021. During this time, VAERS received 8,164 reports of death (0.0021%) among people who received a COVID-19 vaccine. But reports of adverse events to VAERS following vaccination, including deaths, do not necessarily mean that a vaccine caused a health problem. Anyone can submit a report of an adverse event but the reports themselves are not verified. Incomplete VAERS data is often used in conjunction with false claims about vaccine safety. In a part of the CDC website that addresses the topic of adverse events following COVID-19 vaccines, the CDC notes that ""a review of available clinical information, including death certificates, autopsy and medical records, has not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" A tweet claimed that ""CDC numbers"" show that among children, the Pfizer and Moderna COVID-19 vaccines have a death rate ""174 times higher"" than the COVID-19 death rate.  There is no data to back up this claim. The CDC has not reported data for children showing a higher death rate from COVID-19 vaccines than from COVID-19. And there is no clear evidence that COVID-19 vaccines have caused any deaths in the U.S., according to the CDC.

No evidence that COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system
","A chiropractor from Illinois caused a stir online after he posted a YouTube video that he said  showed a patient’s blood work before and after they received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine. In the video, Nathan Thompson, the president of Exemplify Health Center, claimed the results showed that the shots made the immune system ""tank"" and that ""it can't be false because this is medical testing.""  The video was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Thompson avoided saying or spelling out the word vaccine throughout the video to skirt YouTube’s regulations on vaccine misinformation, but it was still taken down. By then, however, his message had already jumped to other websites. Thompson said he ran blood work for a type-2 diabetic patient before the man was compelled by his employer to get the COVID-19 vaccine. The results shown appear in the ""normal"" range. In subsequent panels, which Thompson said were collected after the patient received his first and second doses, the numbers changed. For example, the post-second dose results show that the man’s granulocytes — a type of white blood cell that contains proteins that help the body fight bacterial infections —  went from 58.9 to 79.6. Meanwhile, his lymphocytes — white blood cells that include natural killer cells and immunity-building T and B cells — dropped from 33.8 to 13.8, the results showed. ""His adaptive immune system absolutely has tanked,"" Thompson said. We asked multiple medical experts to review those results, and they said the numbers don’t come close to showing a crashed or suppressed immune system. Meanwhile, there has been no evidence in clinical trials where blood counts were taken that the COVID-19 vaccines weaken the immune system. ""These types of changes (in lab work) frequently occur,"" said Dr. Stanley Perlman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the University of Iowa. ""Things change all the time without it mattering much. In the absence of more information, these numbers don’t mean anything to me."" ""There are all kinds of variations that happen when you measure the immune system and there's going to be some natural fluctuation that occurs,"" said Dr. Amesh Adalja, a senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ""As someone who looks at CBC (complete blood count) panels for patients all day, those numbers aren’t worrisome and don't constitute the immune system ‘crashing’.""  Research from the CDC and others show that the vaccines boost the body’s immune response, not lower it. For example, one Aug. 13 CDC report found that people who had been infected with COVID-19 in 2020 got a dramatic boost in virus-killing immune cells later because they were vaccinated. Dr. Paul Offit, director of the Vaccine Education Center and an attending physician in the Division of Infectious Diseases at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the suggestion that the immune system is weakened by the COVID-19 shots rather than bolstered by them isn’t supported by clinical trial data, which includes thousands of people. ""This wasn't observed in any of the phase 3 trials, where complete blood counts were obtained,"" he said. Different types of vaccines work in different ways to offer protection, but with all types, the body is left with a supply of T-lymphocytes and B-lymphocytes that will remember how to fight that virus in the future. Vaccines help develop immunity by imitating an infection and can sometimes cause symptoms, such as fever.  Some believe that natural immunity from having COVID-19 itself is better than the immunity provided by vaccines. But natural infections can cause severe complications and be deadly. This is true even for diseases that many people consider mild, like chickenpox. It is impossible to predict who will get serious infections that may lead to hospitalization and people are often leaving it up to chance by not getting vaccinated, health experts say. In a video a chiropractor claims that the blood work results of a patient before and after they received two doses of a COVID-19 vaccine show that the shots caused the immune system to ""tank."" Multiple medical experts reviewed screenshots of the lab results and said they were meaningless without more information and didn’t reflect a crashing or suppressed immune system.  The notion that vaccines weaken the immune system wasn’t observed in clinical trials for the vaccines where blood counts were obtained, experts said.

Fox News host Will Cain falsely claims vaccine more dangerous for children than COVID-19
","Fox News host Will Cain falsely claimed the COVID-19 vaccines are more dangerous for children than COVID-19, citing an open-system database that is frequently misused to promote anti-vaccine misinformation. ""We know from VAERS reporting — Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting — and although it's imperfect, we know from that, the risk to children from the vaccine outweighs the risk to COVID,"" Cain said on ""Fox News Primetime"" Oct. 1. ""This comes in the form of hospitalizations.""  ""You are more likely, as a child, to end up in the hospital because of the vaccine than you are because of COVID,"" Cain continued. ""That's data from the CDC and from VAERS."" VAERS is short for the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System, not ""Vaccine Adverse Effects Reporting."" The federal database is open to anyone, and reports to it are not verified before they go public, making it a source that has been exploited by anti-vaccine activists as well as other Fox News hosts. PolitiFact consulted data, research and experts in pediatrics and infectious diseases. We found Cain’s statement to be inaccurate.  Children have generally fared better against COVID-19 than adults. But the disease presents a far greater risk than the vaccines, which have proven safe and effective and are recommended for ages 12 and up by public health agencies and medical associations. To date, children 12 years or older are approved only to get the Pfizer vaccine. ""You’re far more likely to get sick and hospitalized if you get a COVID infection than if you get the vaccine,"" said Dr. Sean O’Leary, a professor at the University of Colorado and the vice chair of the committee on infectious diseases at the American Academy of Pediatrics. One September CDC report said COVID-19 ""hospitalization rates were 10 times higher among unvaccinated than among fully vaccinated adolescents."" Another study from July estimated that every million second dose of the Pfizer vaccine administered to children ages 12 to 17 would prevent 215 COVID-19 hospitalizations on average for boys, and 183 for girls.  On its website, the agency contradicts Cain’s claim: ""CDC continues to recommend that everyone aged 12 years and older get vaccinated for COVID-19. The known risks of COVID-19 illness and its related, possibly severe complications, such as long-term health problems, hospitalization, and even death, far outweigh the potential risks of having a rare adverse reaction to vaccination, including the possible risk of myocarditis or pericarditis."" ""The claim by Will Cain is completely false and contradicted by actual data,"" said Dr. Mark Schleiss, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Minnesota.  Payton Nguyen, 12, receives the Pfizer COVID-19 vaccine from nurse Lakera Thorne at Providence Edwards Lifesciences vaccination site in Santa Ana, Calif., on May 13, 2021. (AP) Cain said on air that his claim about child hospitalizations because of the vaccine was based on VAERS, a database that he acknowledged to be ""imperfect.""  VAERS is useful for researchers, helping them collect data and identify patterns for further examination. But reports to VAERS are not vetted before they go online, so they are not reliable for back-of-the-napkin math, and they are not enough to show cause and effect, experts said.  ""VAERS does not determine causality. It is simply a safety signal fail-safe,"" said Schleiss. ""A kid might get a COVID vaccine and then break her leg playing basketball and be hospitalized."" ""This is a common misuse of VAERS data,"" added Dr. Dean Blumberg, the chief of pediatric infectious diseases at the University of California, Davis. A disclaimer on the VAERS website says ""VAERS reports alone cannot be used to determine if a vaccine caused or contributed to an adverse event or illness,"" and ""may include information that is incomplete, inaccurate, coincidental and unverifiable."" Anyone accessing VAERS must click a button saying they read and understand the disclaimer. PolitiFact reviewed VAERS and identified around 1,000 reports of a hospitalization among children ages 12 to 17 since May, when they became eligible for the Pfizer shot. That’s a tiny percentage of the roughly 14.5 million children ages 12 to 17 who have gotten at least one dose of the vaccine, and nearly 12 million are fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. Another problem was Cain’s data. Doctors said it was cherry picked, and it came from another vaccine after-effects database, not VAERS.  When asked for evidence to support his claim about child hospitalizations caused by the COVID-19 vaccines, Cain pointed through a Fox News spokesperson not to VAERS, but to a slide from a June presentation by the CDC’s Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.  The slide cited data from a newer vaccine database, v-safe, which uses surveys sent through smartphones to collect information from vaccine recipients who voluntarily sign up. The slide said that through mid June, 0.1% of v-safe enrollees ages 12 to 15 received ""medical care in emergency dept/hospital"" after their first Pfizer dose, and 0.2% after their second. Like VAERS, the v-safe database is subject to many limitations, and the responses it collects cannot be used to establish causality. ""It’s by no means a representative sample,"" O’Leary said. ""That’s (Cain) cherry-picking data and misusing data to represent his position."" ""V-safe does not record reason for hospitalization, and it cannot be determined whether hospitalization was related to vaccination,"" a more recent CDC review of v-safe data said. That more recent report, published in August, reviewed v-safe responses through mid-July. Hospitalizations were reported by 0.02% of v-safe enrollees ages 12 to 15 after their first Pfizer shot; 0.04% of enrollees ages 12 to 15 after the second dose; 0.02% of enrollees ages 16 to 17 after the first dose; and 0.03% of enrollees ages 16 to 17 after the second dose. For hospitalizations from COVID-19, Cain cited preliminary hospitalization data from the CDC’s COVID-NET, which logged 4,228 hospitalizations for children ages 0 to 17 through Sept. 25.  But experts said that data is prone to undercounting, since COVID-NET is based on just 100 counties across 10 states. The data’s flaws should be clear, Schleiss said, because it says that only 216,311 adults ages 18 and up have been hospitalized since the start of the pandemic. ""Heck, the rolling 7-day average number of hospitalizations, according to the CDC, is about 70,000,"" Schleiss said. ""At that pace, the COVID-NET numbers would be surpassed in three days. COVID-NET is just a tiny sampling."" The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Children’s Hospital Association provide a more accurate count of child hospitalizations from COVID-19, experts said. Those organizations listed 22,429 hospitalizations for children and a 0.9% hospitalization rate through Sept. 30, based on reporting from 24 states and New York City.  Cain’s claim also glossed over other realities about COVID-19, including that the disease has killed hundreds of children and hobbled many with long-term symptoms. O’Leary said an estimated 1 in 3,200 children who get COVID-19 develop MISC, a rare inflammatory syndrome. The American Academy of Pediatrics and Children’s Hospital Association counted 520 deaths to children from COVID-19 through Sept. 30, based on reporting from 45 states and New York City, while the CDC says VAERS reports have ""not established a causal link to COVID-19 vaccines."" ""There is no question that it is safer for children to be vaccinated against COVID, and that unvaccinated children have an overall higher risk of hospitalization,"" Blumberg said. Cain said, ""You are more likely, as a child, to end up in the hospital because of the vaccine than you are because of COVID. That's data from the CDC and from VAERS."" The claim relied on the faulty assumption that the unverified reports submitted to VAERS can establish causation. Doctors rejected Cain’s claim as false and misleading. The experts said the data Cain provided to PolitiFact was cherry-picked, and that children are far more likely to be hospitalized from COVID-19 than the vaccine. We rate Cain’s claim False.
