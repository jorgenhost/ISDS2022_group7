Julaine Appling says views on same-sex marriage aren’t changing much
","Julaine Appling thinks advocates of same-sex marriage should put the issue to another statewide referendum if they’re so confident public opinion has shifted to their side. ""They argue all the time, ‘the polls are changing,’ "" Appling said to guest host Mike Siegel on the Charlie Sykes show on WTMJ-AM (620) on Jan. 6, 2015. ""Well, the truth is, the polls are not dramatically changing."" Appling was a key figure in the 2006 passage of a statewide referendum that effectively banned same-sex marriage in Wisconsin until a decision by U.S. District Court Judge Barbara Crabb in June 2014. Appling leads Wisconsin Family Council and Wisconsin Family Action, which describe themselves as advocating for Judeo-Christian values. In that 2006 referendum, 59 percent of voters in the fall general election endorsed rewriting the state constitution in a way that legally recognizes marriage only as ""between one man and one woman."" The referendum language also prohibited the state from recognizing ""a legal status identical or substantially similar to that of marriage for unmarried individuals."" The U.S. Supreme Court in October 2014 rejected appeals from Wisconsin and four other states seeking to preserve their same-sex marriage bans. Nationally, it’s well documented that attitudes toward gay marriage have become more much more accepting in recent years. Thirty-six states have legalized gay marriage. But what about in Wisconsin? Asked to provide backup for her claim of no dramatic change, Appling pointed in part to two polls from 2014. Neither, however, broke out any Wisconsin data. One surveyed only Republicans or GOP-leaning independents and found large majorities favoring a traditional definition of marriage. The other was from surveys of people as they exited polling places across the country; it showed voters evenly split on gay marriage nationally. But Appling cited public opinion in Wisconsin, not nationwide. She did point us to a Wisconsin statewide poll conducted by St. Norbert College in 2014 -- but it doesn’t entirely back her point. It found a slim majority (52 percent) in favor of the 2006 amendment’s language regarding marriage for ""one man"" and ""one woman."" Remember, it passed with 59 percent support, so that’s a substantial drop. When we looked ourselves, we found a fairly small number of Wisconsin polls that were on point, but they document relatively large changes in opinion. The St. Norbert ""Wisconsin Survey"" sampled opinion on the ""one man-one woman"" language even before the referendum went to voters, and has continued to do so. From that poll, here are the percentages in favor of the ""one man-one woman"" approach advocated 2006 referendum. Spring 2004: 66 percent Spring 2006: 61 percent Spring 2012: 56 percent Spring 2014: 52 percent. So, while a bare majority in this survey still backed the traditional view, support for it has fallen 14 percentage points in a decade. Other polls The Marquette University Law School Poll tested the issue three times in 2014, and its findings were at odds with the St. Norbert poll. That poll found between 55 percent and 64 percent support for ""allowing gays and lesbians to marry legally."" The portion against legal marriage for such couples ranged in size from 30 percent to 37 percent. That suggests an even bigger change in opinion and suggests a reversal from the 2006 referendum vote. Such comparisons are imperfect, though, due to factors such as the unpredictability of who shows up to vote and the impact of the wording of survey questions. The MU Law Poll was launched just three years ago, so it does not have a long history on this question. But we found a couple other sources. In an August 2011 poll,  Public Policy Polling, a Democratic-leaning firm, found exactly half of respondents thought same-sex marriage should be illegal, with 39 percent saying legal. By spring 2014, the firm for the first time found more in favor of legalizing than against: 47 to 45 percent, though the two-point gap is smaller than the poll’s margin of error. Exit polls provide more evidence. Surveys taken in November 2014 as voters left polling places asked if Wisconsin should legally recognize same-sex marriage. Yes, said 52 percent. No, said 45 percent. One more finding before we close. Pollsters sometimes throw in other options when asking about how to handle the marriage question. They will ask respondents what is closer to their own view: legalizing same-sex marriage, giving civil recognition to such unions, or giving no legal recognition to them. These results also show major changes in opinion, though support for same-sex marriage comes in lower. In 2009, the Wisconsin Policy Research Institute, a conservative think tank, found 27 percent support for same-sex marriage, 32 percent for civil unions but not same-sex marriage, and 35 percent for no legal recognition. In May 2014, five years later, the Marquette poll posed the same question using the exact same language. It found 49 percent support for same-sex marriage, 25 percent for civil unions and 19 percent for no recognition. That’s a change of 22 points for same-sex marriage. Our rating In saying a do-over of the state’s 2006 referendum legalizing only opposite-sex marriages would again pass, Appling said public opinion polls on gay marriage ""are not dramatically changing."" Her remarks were squarely in a Wisconsin context, and surveys here have shown major change in favor of legalizing same-sex marriages. We rate her claim False.",/factchecks/2015/jan/16/julaine-appling/julaine-appling-says-views-same-sex-marriage-arent/

Rep. Jim Steineke says Milwaukee streetcar would be ‘1900s style trolley’
","Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett’s plan to move ahead with a $123.9 million downtown streetcar project -- which is approaching an important vote at the Common Council -- has drawn strong reactions from opponents who want to force a citywide vote. Republicans in Madison have joined the criticism, including Assembly Majority Leader Jim Steineke, who linked spending on the the streetcar to possible public financing for a new Milwaukee Bucks arena. ""Mayor Barrett, if you have $120 mil to pay for a 1900's style trolley, you certainly don't need state tax $ for a #Bucks arena,"" Steineke, a Kaukauna Republican, said in a tweet. When we asked Steineke to elaborate beyond 140 characters, he returned to the theme that the streetcars are outdated technology -- akin to the network Milwaukee had for nearly 100 years until the last route ran in the 1950s. ""Back then they were not for the yuppie entertainment around in the downtown parts of the city,"" Steineke said.  ""We moved away from fixed-rail streetcars 50 years ago as a country."" He continued: ""Obviously there would be more modern cars and electric systems … but the style of transportation remains consistent."" Of course, Barrett isn’t suggesting putting the city’s old streetcar system back into service. The mayor supports a $123.9 million  2.1 mile system, with an 0.4 mile extension to the lake. The Common Council is expected to vote on the proposal Jan. 21, 2015. ""Studies and public statements by Milwaukee developers show that a fixed-rail line will encourage development because of the route’s permanence and the transportation alternative it provides,"" according to an overview of the project prepared by City Engineer Jeff Polenske. Critics counter that it simply takes development away from other areas that are not on the street car line, and that city residents would be better served by an improved bus system with the flexibility to readily change routes. So how would the new system compare with the old? Is Steineke right that the project is an outdated form of transportation? Let’s look at three aspects of the modern streetcar proposal and see how they compare with the city’s previous system. Route and service area Barrett wants a  ""starter system"" based downtown. It would allow for connections to other neighborhoods and -- someday -- destinations far beyond the downtown area such as the Milwaukee Regional Medical Center, Miller Park, the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee and the airport. The previous system began in 1860 with a small network of horse-drawn cars. Those lines eventually grew into a large network powered by electricity. The streetcar became an important part of the city’s fabric -- and the foundation for the city’s electric utility. In terms of routes, it looked more like the current Milwaukee County bus system. In the streetcar’s heyday, Milwaukee had a network of 15 to 20 lines that hauled workers to factories and families to picnics. But ridership declines began in the 1920s as cars became more popular, and after financial troubles the system ceased operation in 1958. So, in terms of scope, the new plan would be much smaller than the old system. But Barrett does have expansion plans in mind. Vehicles Obviously, the new streetcars are …new, compared with those from the past century. They’re air conditioned and quieter, with a ""sleek modern look,"" the city says. The city also notes that the modern system would include ""real time technology"" that tells riders when the next car is arriving. In addition, the cars would be fully accessible to the disabled and carry more people than the older cars. ""In general, describing the proposed system as ‘1900s style’ is accurate but disingenuous,"" said local historian John Gurda, who has written extensively about the old streetcar system.  ""Yes, the cars would follow fixed routes on steel rails, like their predecessors, but so do passenger trains. In both cases, the rolling stock of today is markedly different from what our ancestors knew."" So, Steineke’s claim is accurate in terms of using fixed rails, but what would run on them would be much different than your grandparents’ streetcar. Old technology vs. new popularity Around the country, there’s a streetcar renaissance of sorts underway. Systems operate in at least seven U.S. cities and the Washington Post reported Nov. 30, 2014 that six systems are under construction, with two others -- Milwaukee and Fort Lauderdale, Fla. -- in the planning stages. (Not included in that list is Kenosha, the only Wisconsin city with streetcars. That city’s two-mile loop features vintage cars on rails and is aimed at tourists, with links to museums, the downtown and harbor.) Plans to build new streetcar systems have run into opposition in some areas, including Washington, D.C., where the system has been scaled back from 37 miles to about eight. The Post noted concerns that ""streetcars can gum up, and get caught in, already busy traffic lanes. In nearby Arlington, Va., public skepticism of the high cost and uncertain benefit of a streetcar line caused officials to cancel an entire project"" in November 2014. On the other hand, the system in Portland has expanded five times and now covers eight miles, and Seattle is adding a second route and planning a third. On this point, Steineke is perhaps the most off. There has been a recent burst of streetcar systems, which suggests they are returning in popularity -- not consigned to the history books. Our rating Steineke criticized plans for a new Milwaukee streetcar system, saying the project was a ""1900s style trolley."" His Twitter followers may not be following the project closely, but Steineke certainly knows Barrett isn’t planning a nostalgic system with old-time or refurbished cars. The city sees the streetcar as a modern transportation system, a building block that could lead to future economic growth. In theory, it’s a catalyst rather than a throwback. And at least some other cities see streetcars in the same light. We rate Steineke’s claim Half True.",/factchecks/2015/jan/16/jim-steineke/rep-jim-steineke-says-milwaukee-streetcar-would-be/

R.I. planner Kevin Flynn: Nothing in RhodeMap RI plan takes away local government, zoning control
","The RhodeMap RI long-term economic development plan continues to spark controversy throughout Rhode Island. This week, Republican legislators said they would submit legislation to free municipalities from having to incorporate it in their local planning. That follows comments House Speaker Nicholas Mattiello made in December to radio station WPRO-AM. Mattiello said, ""the plan is never going to come before the House or the Senate in its totality and we’re never going to vote on it."" The controversy started in mid-September with the release of a 200-page draft of the plan, which is meant to guide efforts to improve the state’s economy. During meetings that sometimes descended into shouting matches, critics said that if RhodeMap RI were implemented, local cities and towns would be relinquishing control to the federal government on affordable housing and land-use issues because the plan was paid for, in part, by a $1.9 million U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development grant. Supporters said there's nothing in the plan that would infringe on individual property rights or local control over zoning.  Because the debate is likely to continue in the coming months, we decided to examine a statement made late last year by Kevin M. Flynn, associate director for planning for the state Division of Planning, who oversaw the plan’s development. Addressing concerns about ceding municipal control, Flynn told EcoRI News, ""there’s nothing in the plan that takes away local government control and local zoning control."" We asked Flynn how he backed up his statement. While we waited for a response, we read through the RhodeMap RI plan, and found nothing to indicate a threat to local control, suggesting Flynn’s statement was accurate. But things got more complicated when we looked at other documents, including the Planning Division’s grant application, the grant agreement, and HUD’s description of the Sustainable Regional Planning Grant Program, the source of the $1.9 million. According to HUD, the program is intended to support planning efforts that integrate land use, economic and workforce development, transportation and infrastructure investments. It also aims to enable local and state planners to consider such issues as energy use, climate change, public health and ""social equity"" in economic planning. Agencies that apply for such grants must agree to generate plans aimed at producing, among other objectives, ""equitable land use planning"" that furthers the federal Fair Housing Act and complies with other civil rights laws. And those agencies must agree to analyze and overcome barriers to housing discrimination -- in HUD’s words, to  ""affirmatively further fair housing."" Critics view those provisions with alarm, saying they essentially give the federal government license to override state and local government control. They point to a long-running legal dispute involving New York’s Westchester County as Exhibit A. More on that in a moment. When Flynn got back to us, he referred us to Article XIII of the Rhode Island Constitution, which empowers cities and towns to adopt and amend their charters, and enact and amend local land use laws. He also cited state zoning enabling legislation, which delegates zoning authority to cities and towns. ""A plan is simply that. A plan,"" Flynn said. ""A plan has no power to modify constitutional or statutory law."" ""The economic development plan could never supercede state law,"" he said. ""That is a basic tenet of our jurisprudence.""   Looking for more impartial views, we reached out to more than 10 national housing law experts. The four who responded agreed that communities do not cede zoning control when they accept HUD grants. But they had some caveats. For example, Brian Gilmore, an associate professor and director of the Housing Clinic at Michigan State University College of Law, said, ""I wouldn’t say they’ve ceded total control. I would say they have obligations."" Robert G. Schwemm, a professor at the University of Kentucky College of Law, said much the same thing.   ""It’s illegal to use local zoning power to maintain segregation,"" Schwemm said.   However, ""HUD has no direct power over local zoning authority,"" Schwemm said. ""HUD could deny the grant or take back money,"" but that’s a remote possibility, he said. ""The idea of a fund cutoff is virtually unheard of,"" because historically, the Fair Housing Act ""has been enforced weakly. … They’re doing more than has been done in the past,"" he said of the Obama administration. HUD’s Annual Report on Fair Housing 2012-2013 showed that the agency received 495 analyses by cities and towns examining fair housing choice. Of those, HUD took enforcement  action in five instances. Here’s why Westchester County is important. In 2006, a housing advocacy group sued the county in federal court, arguing that it had defrauded taxpayers by accepting $50 million in HUD grant money while failing to remove barriers to fair housing as required by its agreement with HUD. HUD later became a plaintiff in the suit. A judge ultimately agreed with the plaintiffs, and a landmark settlement was reached requiring the county to spend $50 million to build or acquire 750 affordable-housing units in communities that were more than 90 percent white. Now, the county and HUD are fighting over whether the county has complied with the settlement and whether it must amend its zoning ordinances to do so. The county has lost at least $20 million in HUD grants so far. We contacted the county for its take on HUD grants and local control. ""The experience in Westchester has been caveat emptor,"" said Ned McCormack, Westchester  communications director and senior adviser to County Executive Robert P. Astorino, using the Latin phrase for ""buyer beware."" ""Once you take any money from HUD, your interpretation of what is expected in return and their interpretation vary widely.""   Our ruling Kevin M. Flynn said nothing in the RhodeMap RI plan ""takes away local government control and local zoning control."" Technically, there is nothing in the plan’s language that appears to compromise local zoning law or control. But his statement doesn’t acknowledge the strings attached to the HUD grant. In accepting the $1.9 million from HUD to develop the plan, the state agreed to, among other things, expand housing opportunities for underserved populations on the basis of race, ethnicity, or economic status and, thus, is obligated to do so. In fact, HUD has taken legal action against grant recipients such as Westchester County that, in its view, failed to live up to its agreement. It’s rare, but it has happened. For the record, in December, 26 Rhode Island cities and towns were awarded nearly $5.3 million in HUD grants through the Community Development Block Grant program On balance, we rate Flynn’s claim is ""partially accurate but leaves out important details or takes things out of context,"" our definition of Half True. (Correction: Article XIII of the Rhode Island Constitution spells out home rule for cities and towns. The article number was incorrect in the original version of this item.)",/factchecks/2015/jan/16/kevin-flynn/ri-planner-kevin-flynn-nothing-rhodemap-ri-plan-ta/

Deal a little off on the numbers but right on the point
","Size matters. That was the implication in a recent round of news stories, touting Florida surpassing New York as the third most populous state. Overlooked in most coverage was Georgia’s move up, something Gov. Nathan Deal tried to rectify in his State of the State speech on Wednesday. ""Georgia is now the eighth most populous state in the nation, moving from the number 10 position in just four years,"" Deal said. Political junkies know that with more people comes, at the very least, more Congressional seats. Or, as Deal would have it, evidence that a state is creating jobs and drawing top talent from around the nation. But looking at just the data, is Deal right on the numbers? PolitiFact Georgia decided to check. The question of population falls to the U.S. Census Bureau, which in addition to conducting the decennial count that determines Congressional representation also releases annual population estimates for each state. The latest, pegged to July 1, estimated that 10,097,343 live in Georgia. That’s an increase of 102,584 from 2013, or a little bit larger than the city of Sandy Springs. It’s the first time Georgia reached the milestone of 10 million residents, and it puts the Peach State in 8th place among all states. That means Deal is right on the first part of his statement. But he’s off when comparing to four years ago, and the numbers from the 2010 Census. Way back when Betty White was a mere 88 years old, and ""The Walking Dead"" first showed what could happen to Georgia in a zombie apocalypse, the state had 9,687,653 people, Census data show. That put Georgia in ninth place in terms of population, just behind Michigan but one slot ahead of neighboring North Carolina. But what about Deal’s bigger point, that our growth is a signal of greater economic development? There, the same data can back him up. The 2014 Census data makes it look as if North Carolina surpassed Michigan in the latest counts. It did – but Georgia surged past Michigan first, said Robert Bernstein, a spokesman with the agency. ""You’ll see it occasionally that a state will surpass another,"" Bernstein said. ""What’s significant here is Michigan was leapfrogged twice, by both Georgia and North Carolina."" Part of that shift is undoubtedly for jobs. The recent announcement that Mercedes-Benz USA will move its headquarters to metro Atlanta does not take people from Michigan, long the home to the nation’s auto industry. But it is another example of the gradual creation of the Southeast as the industry’s new hub. Chris Carr, the commissioner of Georgia’s Department of Economic Development, said Georgia had earlier lost out to Alabama for Mercedes’ new manufacturing plant. But the state left a good enough impression for the firm to consider it for its new headquarters, in part because Georgia’s growth is good for customers and workers alike, he said. ""When companies are looking for a place to go, they need the right business climate but they want to make sure they are taking care of their employees and have a great place to live, too,"" Carr said. ""There is a psychological impact that we are growing, that shows people there is a reason to be here,"" Carr said. That was the point Deal was trying to make, when he claimed Georgia is now the 8th most populous state and moved up two spots in just four years. The governor was off on the state’s ranking four years ago. We only moved up one spot. But he is right about where the state’s population is now – and how that population can tie to jobs.

It’s about the bay area’s success. … It’s a ‘we’ proposition, not a ‘me’ proposition."" Buckhorn has worked to streamline development regulation at City Hall, and tries to build confidence about the bay area, extolling its virtues and setting an upbeat tone. But any mayor has a limited ability to influence job growth. Economic trends beyond the control of city executives alone tend to dictate whether jobs are created or lost. And the Tampa Bay area’s experience in the last year demonstrates that those trends can change direction. This time last year, the Tampa Bay area led all Florida metros in adding jobs over the previous year, with 35,400 new jobs in the 12 months that ended in December 2013. That changed in 2014, according to labor statistics from the Florida Department of Economic Opportunity.   Through November, the most recent month for which figures are available, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metro area had created 12,900 jobs over a 12-month period. That put it in a tie for fifth place among Florida metro areas with West Palm Beach-Boca Raton-Boynton Beach, which also created 12,900 jobs in a local workforce that is less than half the size of the Tampa Bay area’s. In 2014, the top four metro areas for job creation were Orlando-Kissimmee-Sanford (46,300 new jobs in the 12 months ending in November), Miami-Miami Beach-Kendall (39,500 jobs), Ft. Lauderdale-Pompano Beach-Deerfield Beach (28,400 jobs) and Jacksonville (17,000 jobs). Taking a longer view, the picture looks better for the Tampa Bay area. From April 2010 to April 2014, the bay area added 134,346 jobs, more than in the Orlando, Miami, Ft. Lauderdale, Jacksonville and West Palm Beach metro areas. From April 2011, the month that Buckhorn took office as mayor, through April 2014, Orlando produced more jobs, with the Tampa Bay area close behind.

Buckhorn secures ‘highest possible bond rating,’ commercial says
","In touting Tampa’s fiscal health, an ad that Mayor Bob Buckhorn’s re-election campaign is running on television says that he ""secured the highest possible bond rating"" for the city.

McCain: 30% of past Guantanamo detainees 're-enter the fight'
","Too many detainees released from Guantanamo are re-engaging in terrorism, according to several key Republicans pushing legislation to keep the prison open. Republican Sens. Kelly Ayotte, N.H., Richard Burr, N.C., Lindsey Graham, S.C., and John McCain, Ariz., proposed a bill Jan. 13 that would restrict detainee transfers from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. The bill would prohibit the transfer of high or medium-risk detainees and any transfers to Yemen, as well as increase transparency about detainees’ risk assessments, among other measures.      President Barack Obama in recent months has ramped up the number of people he’s transferred out of Guantanamo, in hopes of closing the facility by the time his term ends. During his 2008 campaign, Obama promised to close the prison, which opened in 2002 during the war on terror, but 122 prisoners remain. At a press conference announcing the legislation, McCain, chair of the Senate Armed Services Committee, gave a statistic that he’s said before, regarding how many detainees go back to terrorism. ""We know for a fact that roughly 30 percent of those who have been released have re-entered the fight, and usually at a very high level, because it's a badge of honor to have been an inmate at Guantanamo Bay,"" McCain said. ""So instead we're going to continue to release batches of prisoners, according to this administration, with no plan, and the extreme likelihood that approximately one out of every three of them will re-enter the fight."" Others critical of Obama’s policy on releasing Guantanamo detainees have recited the claim that 30 percent ""re-enter the fight"" -- including former Vice President Dick Cheney and Sen. James Inhofe, R-Okla. It turns out that the numbers aren’t that strong when broken down into their parts. The facts Determining how many released prisoners have ""re-entered the fight"" is not an exact science, and some dispute the numbers provided by the federal government, particularly because the government does not release the names of individuals on its list. How they arrive at their numbers is not transparent. Here’s what we do know: At least every six months, the Director of National Intelligence, an Obama appointee, publishes a Congress-mandated report detailing the number of former Guantanamo detainees who have re-engaged in terrorist or insurgent activity since the prison opened in 2002. The latest report was published in September 2014 and has data from July 2014. A quick scan of these numbers shows problems with the 30 percent re-engagement claims. Total detainees held since 2002: more than 750 Detainees released: 620 Former detainees confirmed of re-engaging: 107 (17.3 percent) Former detainees suspected of re-engaging: 77 (12.4 percent) To get near that 30 percent figure, we have to group together those confirmed of re-engaging and those suspected of re-engaging. Also, of those 107 confirmed of re-engaging, 48 are either dead or in custody. So in total, 59 of 620 released Guantanamo detainees -- or about 9 percent -- are confirmed by the government to have re-engaged in terrorism and are currently at large. In an email to PolitiFact, McCain spokesman Brian Rogers acknowledged that the 30 percent figure includes both the confirmed and suspected categories. (In the same press conference, Ayotte also cited the 30 percent statistic, but she was careful to note the distinction between confirmed and suspected cases.) Of the first 20 prisoners brought to Guantanamo, only eight remain, according to a report out of the Miami Herald. Of those 12 who are no longer at Guantanamo, only one is known to have re-engaged in terrorist activity.   In June 2014, the New America Foundation, a centrist think tank, conducted its own investigation of the 620 released former detainees, using Pentagon reports, media stories and other public information. They found that 54 of them ""are either confirmed to be or suspected of engaging in militant activities against either the U.S. or non-U.S. targets."" This is about one-third of the government’s figure -- 184 confirmed or suspected of engaging in these activities. In a CNN article, the New America Foundation researchers said it is possible that the publicly available information they used might not have identified some of the former detainees who are engaged in terrorist activity. However, they said they are ""confident"" in their numbers because terrorist groups ""are eager to trumpet the identities of released Guantanamo detainees who join their ranks."" In its reports on recidivism rates, the foundation’s researchers have not argued for or against releasing prisoners or closing Guantanamo, but they have called on the government to be more transparent with its list of individuals included in their counts. Stephen Vladeck, a law professor and expert in national security at American University, said the government numbers are suspect because it’s unclear how the government proves that someone has re-engaged in these activities and how much evidence is required. ""To paraphrase a Scottish writer, Sen. McCain and his colleagues are using these numbers the way drunks use lampposts—more for support than for illumination,"" Vladeck said. An ongoing trend? McCain doesn’t necessarily blame Obama outright for the recidivism rate. But, at the very least, he implied that former detainees re-engaging in terrorism is an ongoing trend: ""We're going to continue to release batches of prisoners, according to this administration, with no plan, and the extreme likelihood that approximately one out of every three of them will re-enter the fight,"" he said. The numbers show that the majority of releases that have resulted in re-engagement happened before 2009 -- during former President George W. Bush’s administration. Here’s the total number of released detainees and their re-engagement rates broken down over those two periods: Pre-Jan. 22, 2009 (Bush) Post-Jan. 22, 2009 (Obama) Total detainees released 532 88 Confirmed of re-engaging 101 (19 percent) 6 (6.8 percent) Suspected of re-engaging 76 (14.3 percent) 1 (1.1 percent) We should note Obama has sped up the transfer of Guantanamo detainees to foreign countries since mid November. The government transferred five Yemenis Jan. 13. This report only includes data up until July 2014. Rogers, McCain’s spokesman, pointed out that ""it can take some time for us to identify (former detainees) on the field of battle, and it would make sense that some recent releases may not yet have been identified or engaged."" According to the annual report, the Director of National Intelligence has come to expect some relapse into criminal activity from its former detainees, particularly if they are transferred to countries with active conflicts and terrorist recruiting operations. To McCain’s point that those who have ""re-entered the fight"" do so ""usually at a very high level,"" DePaul University history professor Thomas Mockaitis said this isn’t necessarily the case. ""Those released who have been out of the fight for so long would probably not have been important players any longer, if they ever were,"" he said. ""So it is not clear how much their going back to terrorism mattered."" He added that, ""Neither al-Qaida or (the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria) is short of recruits."" Our ruling McCain said ""about 30 percent"" of those released from Guantanamo ""have re-entered the fight."" Government numbers show 17 percent of former Guantanamo detainees are confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorist or insurgent activity, while 12 percent are just suspected of re-engaging. Accounting for those who have been killed or taken back into custody, about 9 percent are confirmed to have re-engaged in terrorism and are currently on the battlefield. Additionally, McCain implies that this is a recent trend, which doesn’t seem to be the case. There are also some experts who dispute the government’s figures. The 30 percent figure doesn’t come out of thin air, but it doesn’t give an accurate picture. We rate McCain’s claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jan/15/john-mccain/mccain-30-past-guantanamo-detainees-re-enter-fight/

Widely shared meme oversimplifies Joe Barton's 2009 comment on wind energy, climate change
","Rep. Joe Barton, R-Texas, is not popular among environmentalists. A former chairman of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee, Barton is a staunch advocate for fossil fuels and expressed skepticism about the role of manmade carbon emissions in climate change. Barton’s critics like to paint him as blindly supportive of Big Oil and as anti-science. Exhibit A is a series of social media memes that mock him for suggesting that wind power can actually intensify global warming. The most extreme version we found said Barton had claimed that ""wind power would stop the Earth from rotating."" That’s clearly not true, but it’s also not clear that this claim was meant to be taken seriously. Instead, we decided to check a less outrageous -- and more common -- meme mocking Barton. A reader recently sent us a meme featuring a picture of Barton alongside the quotation, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up."" The meme’s creator went on to comment, ""The only thing more stupid than this idiot heading the House-Senate energy conf(erence) is Michelle Bachmann's stint on the House 'Intelligence' Committee!"" (Michele Bachmann's name is misspelled.) Ultimately, we concluded that Barton’s words were significantly altered. What did Barton actually say? As it turns out, the comments from the meme we’re checking stem from a congressional hearing held almost six years ago, on Feb. 26, 2009. As part of a lengthy question-and-answer session, Barton pressed witnesses on some of the risks of shifting the nation’s energy portfolio from fossil fuels to renewable sources. In one exchange, Barton referred to a paper by Jay Apt, director of the Carnegie Mellon Electricity Industry Center and a professor of technology at the Tepper School of Business. In turn, Apt’s paper relied on research in an earlier paper by David W. Keith, currently a professor of applied physics and public policy at Harvard University. Barton’s off-the-cuff comments are somewhat meandering, but the general gist of what he said was to raise questions about some of the downsides of using wind to generate electricity. ""I am going to read a paragraph which is, if true, very ironic. And this is from Dr. Apt’s paper, and I quote: ‘Wind energy is a finite resource. At large scale, slowing down the wind by using its energy to turn turbines has environmental consequences. A group of researchers at Princeton University … found that wind farms may change the mixing of air near the surface, drying the soil near the site. At planetary scales, David Keith, who was then at Carnegie Mellon, and coworkers found that if wind supplied 10 percent of expected global electricity demand in 2100 … the resulting change in the earth’s atmospheric energy might cause some regions of the world to experience temperature change of approximately 1 degree Centigrade.’ …  ""Now, wind is God’s way of balancing heat. Wind is the way you shift heat from areas where it is hotter to areas where it is cooler. That is what wind is. Wouldn’t it be ironic if in the interest of global warming we mandated massive switches to energy, which is a finite resource, which slows the winds down, which causes the temperature to go up? Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman, but that is definitely something on the massive scale. I mean, it does make some sense. You stop something. You can’t transfer that heat and the heat goes up. It is just something to think about."" Reading the full text shows that the meme glossed over some important nuances, perhaps by relying on a brief summation published by Time magazine in 2010. First, even though the meme used quotation marks to frame the comment as a single, unified quote, it’s actually a stitched-together mix of several snippets from Barton’s remarks. Second, the meme ignores that when Barton said that ""wind is a finite resource,"" he was explicitly quoting Apt’s paper, rather than saying that was his personal belief. Third, the meme overlooks that when Barton supposedly said that harnessing the wind ""would slow the winds down, which would cause the temperature to go up,"" he was actually asking the witness a question rather than stating his view. And fourth, the meme ignores that Barton said in the same exchange, ""Now, I am not saying that is going to happen, Mr. Chairman."" In other words, what he was doing was posing a scenario to be discussed further. So, while Barton’s comments clearly show an openness to the ideas he addressed, the meme is off-base in suggesting that Barton was stating his own opinion. For the record, Barton’s spokesman, Sean Brown, told PolitiFact that the congressman ""believes in an all-of-the-above energy plan that includes wind and solar power but also doesn’t ignore traditional sources of energy like coal or natural gas."" Is there any credibility to the idea that wind energy might contribute to global warming? So Barton didn’t say what the meme said he did. But what about the substance of the claim -- that wind turbines can exacerbate global warming? The idea isn’t entirely out of left field, but it’s a lot more complicated than it seems on the surface. Let’s start with what was known at the time Barton made his comment six years ago. The paper ultimately referenced by Barton -- the one that Keith coauthored -- found some intriguing interactions between wind turbines and climate, namely that ""very large amounts of wind power"" can produce changes to climate ""at continental scales."" However, the authors leavened this assessment with a more optimistic note -- that such changes in climate disappear at the global level, and that, on balance, using wind power rather than fossil fuels reduces climate change, rather than exacerbating it. Keith, who didn’t respond to an inquiry from PolitiFact, and his coauthors also emphasized that what negative impacts emerged from wind-turbine use could be eased, fairly economically, by better turbine design and placement. Subsequent research has bolstered this conclusion. A 2012 study that used satellite data for west-central Texas, published in Nature Climate Change and co-authored by Liming Zhou of the State University of New York at Albany, found a ""significant warming trend"" of up to 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit per decade over wind farms, compared to nearby regions that didn’t have wind farms. However, Zhou told the Daily Telegraph that the climatic changes from wind farms paled when compared to the impact of manmade global warming. And Mark Z. Jacobson, a Stanford University professor of civil and environmental engineering, told PolitiFact that a 2012 paper he coauthored found that the impact of large arrays of wind turbines would be to cool climate -- not warm it. ""That paper is the most detailed to date,"" Jacobson said. Jacobson agreed that even installing enough wind-power capacity to power ""half the world"" would have ""small"" global impacts on climate, even though the impacts locally could be more significant. If you weigh the negatives of wind power against the negatives of fossil-fuel use, he added, ""there is only a net benefit of switching to wind."" Our ruling A social media meme says Barton once said, ""Wind is a finite resource and harnessing it would slow the winds down which would cause the temperature to go up."" Barton raised that possibility while questioning a witness during a 2009 congressional hearing, but contrary to the meme’s implication, he did not say that it was his personal belief. Rather, the meme makes fun of Barton by stitching together parts of his comments in a way that is misleading. The statement contains some element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression, so we rate it Mostly False.

Huge disparity in the jailing of black and white males in Milwaukee, Facebook meme says
","For years, Milwaukee has made national headlines for being one of the most segregated urban areas in America. In 2011, we rated Mostly True a Rev. Jesse Jackson claim that Milwaukee is the nation’s most-segregated city. We found that the white-black segregation is worst in metropolitan Milwaukee, if not in the city itself. Now there’s an Internet meme that has been liked, shared or commented on more than 18,000 times on Facebook. It makes a two-part claim about Milwaukee and putting whites and blacks behind bars. Milwaukee, the posting says, ""incarcerates 1.2 percent of white men"" and has ""incarcerated over 50 percent of black men in their 30s."" ""Pass this along for the millions of people who say racism is not an issue. Cure them of their ignorance,"" the group said in posting the meme. The black-white gap between the two percentages caught our attention. But so did the fact that the percentages measure two different things. Behind the meme The meme was posted Dec. 31, 2014 on Facebook by US Uncut, a loose network of local groups that coordinates nationally through the Internet. The Daily Beast has described the group as the ""tea party for the left."" Its Facebook page has more than 932,000 likes. The group, formed in 2011, says it has ""mobilized thousands of people against corporate tax dodging and austerity."" But it has also addressed racial issues. We connected via phone and email with Mark Provost of Manchester, N.H., who describes himself as a meme maker for US Uncut. He said the two statistics cited in the meme came from a study published in 2013 by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. (That study garnered news coverage from the BBC, among others.) First part of the claim The first part of US Uncut's claim is 1.2 percent of white men in Milwaukee are incarcerated. But what the UWM study says is 1.2 percent of white men in Wisconsin were incarcerated in state prison or local jails -- there is no such figure in the study for Milwaukee. That was as of April 2010, when U.S. Census Bureau conducted its most recent decennial count of Wisconsin residents. Provost acknowledged that that part of the study deals only with Wisconsin, and that he doesn't have a figure for Milwaukee. It’s worth noting the study did find a much higher rate of African-American men in Wisconsin -- 12.8 percent -- were incarcerated at the time. That was the highest such rate in the nation, according to the study (Oklahoma was second at 9.7 percent). Second part The second part of the claim is Milwaukee has incarcerated more than 50 percent of black men in their 30s. An important point here is that the first part of the claim was about incarceration at one point in time. This part of the claim covers more than two decades. The UWM study estimated based on state correctional records that over half of black men in their 30s in Milwaukee County (rather than the city) were incarcerated in state correctional facilities between 1990 and January 2012. The difference between the city and the county doesn’t appear significant. Lois Quinn, one of the researchers who did the study, told us the study doesn’t have city of Milwaukee figures on this statistic. ""But given the concentrations of African-Americans residing in the city and the maps of those incarcerated, I believe that it would be accurate to expect"" that over half of black men in their 30s in the city have been or were incarcerated during that period, she said. The study did not, however, attempt to make the same incarceration estimate for white men in their 30s. In any case, placing the two side by side amounts to mixing apples and oranges. The first figure is for people incarcerated at a given moment in time. The second is for people who have ever been incarcerated, which clearly skews the comparison. Our rating The left-wing activist group US Uncut says in a Facebook meme that Milwaukee ""incarcerates 1.2 percent of white men"" and has ""incarcerated over 50 percent of black men in their 30s."" But the way the claim is structured overstates the disparity, based on the university study it relies on. On the first part of the claim (which should refer to Wisconsin, rather than Milwaukee), 1.2 percent of white men were incarcerated as of the latest census, versus 12.8 percent of black men. That is, at a given point in time. The second part of the claim essentially quotes the study accurately -- more than 50 percent of black men in their 30s in Milwaukee County were or had been incarcerated. But there is no corresponding figure for white men. For a statement that is partially accurate but leaves out important details, our rating is Half True.

Fox News guest Steven Emerson says Birmingham is 'totally Muslim'
","Sometimes a claim is so egregious that a prime minister chokes on his porridge. So infuriating that international backlash spurs a sassy hashtag and leads the speaker to apologize profusely the very next day. So wrong that even though it’s already been widely debunked, people are still asking that we give it the PunditFact treatment. Such is the case with a comment about Birmingham, England, by news pundit Steve Emerson, who appeared as a guest Jan. 10, 2015, on Fox News’ Justice with Judge Jeanine. Host Jeanine Pirro introduced Emerson as founder of The Investigative Project on Terrorism for a segment about ""no-go"" zones for non-Muslims in Europe. Emerson said the zones exist in France and throughout the rest of Europe as ""safe havens"" for Muslims ruled by Sharia courts and not a country’s own laws. ""In Britain, it’s not just no-go zones,"" Emerson said. ""There are actual cities like Birmingham that are totally Muslim, where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in. And parts of London, there are actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and actually wound seriously anyone who doesn't dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire."" Western Europe is just not dealing with the situation, he said. Western Europe, meanwhile, did not seem amused by his comment. And make no mistake, the claim is wrong. The city of Birmingham, situated north and west of London, has more than 1 million residents. There are more whites and Christians than any other ethnicity or religion, we found. According to a report of the 2011 UK Census by the Birmingham City Council, 46 percent of residents said they were Christian and 22 percent, or 234,111 people, identified as Muslim. No doubt, Islam is a growing and popular faith in Birmingham, up 7.5 percentage points from 2001 to 2011. Three Birmingham wards, Heath, Bordesley Green and Sparkbrook, had Muslim populations that exceeded half of the population, all ranging from 70 percent to about 77 percent. Not that this gives any credence to Emerson’s claim about the city of Birmingham as a whole. This does not amount to the city ""being totally Muslim."" Emerson apologized on his website and on the BBC, among other forums, for his remarks. He attributed his statement about Birmingham to sloppy fact-checking. (No kidding.) Here is the apology: I have clearly made a terrible error for which I am deeply sorry. My comments about Birmingham were totally in error. And I am issuing this apology and correction for having made this comment about the beautiful city of Birmingham. I do not intend to justify or mitigate my mistake by stating that I had relied on other sources because I should have been much more careful. There was no excuse for making this mistake and I owe an apology to every resident of Birmingham.  I am not going to make any excuses. I made an inexcusable error. And I am obligated to openly acknowledge that mistake.  I wish to apologize for all residents of that great city of Birmingham. Steve Emerson PS. I am making (a) donation to Birmingham Children's Hospital. British Prime Minister David Cameron, who really did say the remark caused him to choke on his porridge, called Emerson a ""complete idiot."" ""He started with an apology,"" Cameron said. ""That's not a bad start. But what he should do is look at Birmingham and see what a fantastic example it is bringing people together of different faiths and different backgrounds and building a world-class brilliant city with a great and strong economy."" A note about Emerson’s other point, that in parts of London there are ""actually Muslim religious police that actually beat and actually wound seriously anyone who doesn't dress according to Muslim, religious Muslim attire."" While there are no official Muslim religious police, there have been some reports of ""Muslim patrols"" or ""Sharia patrols"" trying to make people in parts of East London follow Islamic law, and three people were jailed for doing so in 2013. But there’s little information to suggest the patrols are widespread or involve many people. Our ruling Emerson said Birmingham is a city in England that is totally Muslim, ""where non-Muslims just simply don’t go in."" He has since admitted that is inaccurate, and for good reason. The stats say Birmingham is about 20 percent Muslim. All that is left to say is Emerson’s statement rates Pants on Fire!",/factchecks/2015/jan/14/steven-emerson/fox-news-guest-steven-emerson-says-birmingham-tota/

Has the WH supported the spread of blasphemy laws?
","France has braced itself for yet another round of Islamic extremist attacks as the latest issue of Charlie Hebdo hits the newsstands. Following the murders of most of the Paris-based satirical paper’s staff last week, the cover features a cartoon Mohammed with a tear rolling down his cheek, under a headline that reads in French, ""All is forgiven."" He holds the symbol of solidarity with the slain journalists, a sign that says ""Je suis Charlie,"" or ""I am Charlie."" While that message might be somber, a powerful vein of Muslim thought sees any depiction of Mohammed as blasphemous. Cartoons like this were what drew death threats in the past. In this violent clash between the pen and the sword, politicians and pundits in the western democracies largely put the onus on the Islamic world to uphold the principle of freedom of expression. But a prominent American law professor wrote in a Sunday Washington Post op-ed that the Obama administration itself has abetted the forces of intolerance. In that op-ed, Jonathan Turley of George Washington University Law School primarily criticized the French for passing laws that criminalize speech that insults, defames or incites violence on the basis of religion, race, or other social marker. At the end of his piece, however, Turley brings his critique closer to home. ""In 2009, the Obama administration shockingly supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard,"" Turley wrote, ""And as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton invited delegations to Washington to work on implementing that standard."" Has the administration really supported Muslim countries as they seek to spread an international standard forbidding blasphemy? We took a closer look. (For the record, Turley is representing House Republicans in their health care lawsuit against the president, but his stance on this issue came long before.) At the heart of Turley’s argument is American support for United Nations Human Rights Council Resolution 16/18. The U.S. goal was to establish common ground for religious tolerance. Or, as the opening lines of the resolution put it, ""to promote and encourage universal respect for and observance of all human rights and fundamental freedoms without distinction as to, inter alia, religion or belief.""   Approved in March 2011, the document has many clauses. These three are the most relevant to our fact-check: It affirms ""the positive role that the exercise of the right to freedom of opinion and expression and the full respect for the freedom to seek, receive and impart information can play in strengthening democracy and combating religious intolerance."" It ""condemns any advocacy of religious hatred that constitutes incitement to discrimination, hostility or violence, whether it involves the use of print, audio-visual or electronic media or any other means."" In a list of ""actions to foster a domestic environment of religious tolerance, peace and respect,"" it calls on states to adopt ""measures to criminalize incitement to imminent violence based on religion or belief."" For Turley and other free speech advocates, the kicker is that last point and the green light it gives to criminalizing expressions that incite others to violence. ""The president has said that he does not support criminalizing blasphemy, but the reality is that the language of the resolution criminalizes the same speech,"" Turley told PunditFact. A quick history of blasphemy at the UN The effort to give blasphemy laws international legal standing at the United Nations goes back 15 years. It was largely a project of Muslim nations working through the Organization of Islamic Cooperation, an umbrella group with 57 member countries. In committees like the Human Rights Council, they were able to win majority support for policies to rein in freedom of expression in the name of preventing religious defamation. The United States and Western European representatives opposed these moves on free speech grounds, but found themselves out-voted. The Islamic nations pressed the defamation issue until a few years ago. Then in 2011, compromise language emerged that dropped any reference to blasphemy or defamation. The measure passed by unanimous consent. Then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton called it a landmark achievement. ""The United States strongly supports today’s resolution, which rejects the broad prohibitions on speech called for in the former ‘defamation of religions’ resolution, and supports approaches that do not limit freedom of expression or infringe on the freedom of religion,"" Clinton said in a prepared statement. Human rights advocacy groups, such as Human Rights First and British-based Article 19, also endorsed the measure. Human Rights First wrote, ""Resolution 16/18 ceases to provide cover for national blasphemy laws and charts a new course. The resolution omits any reference to ‘defamation of religions’ and — in accordance with international standards — focuses on the protection of individuals, rather than the protection of abstract ideas and religions."" We reached out to the White House to learn how the ""incitement to immediate violence"" phrase is different from the religious defamation language sought by the Muslim governments. We did not hear back, but in a published letter, two high-level State Department officials, Michael Posner and Suzan Johnson Cook, explained how these words are in synch with American law. They cited the 1969 Brandenburg v. Ohio decision involving a member of the Ku Klux Klan. In its ruling,  the U.S. Supreme Court held that all speech is protected ""except where such advocacy is directed to inciting or producing imminent lawless action and is likely to incite or produce such action."" Posner and Cook wrote, ""drawing a caricature of the prophet Muhammad that resulted in violence by Muslim extremists would not constitute 'incitement to imminent violence' under the Brandenburg test."" Accordingly, the resolution, they said, would protect freedom of expression. Reading the UN rules differently Blasphemy laws are not rare. According to the Pew Research Center, in 2012 nearly a quarter of all countries had them. The list includes some European countries, such as Germany and Ireland, but the greatest concentration is in the Middle East where every Muslim nation from Egypt to Pakistan has them. In Pakistan, for example, a person could, in theory, be executed for insulting the prophet Mohammed or the Koran. No executions have happened, but in 2012, Pakistan prosecuted a dozen blasphemy cases. Muslim governments consistently argue that it is okay to restrict speech when that speech incites others to violence. Ekmeleddin İhsanoğlu, Secretary-General of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation until 2014, made that clear in a 2012 interview with the French news service France24. İhsanoğlu spoke more than a year after the UN resolution passed and about a month after the attack on the American consulate in Benghazi that killed the U.S. ambassador and three other Americans. ""The OIC — I as secretary — I am a staunch supporter of freedom of expression,"" İhsanoğlu said. ""But freedom of expression, according to international law, does not entail freedom of insulting others, denigrating others, mocking others."" For İhsanoğlu, just as no one has the right to randomly scream ""Fire!"" in a crowded theater, no one has the right to insult Mohammed if others might respond violently. When the interviewer pressed and said ""making fun of a religion doesn’t necessarily equate with incitement to violence,"" İhsanoğlu was adamant and specifically said that cartoons that mock Mohammed should be banned, in France and elsewhere. ""If you don’t respect the feelings of 1.5 billion people, and if you don’t feel yourself responsible not to insult them, then we have a problem here. And if we have a problem here, we will have a problem there, with the demonstrations and taking to street and using violence,"" İhsanoğlu said. The secretary-general went on to say that the anti-Islam video that contributed to the attack in Benghazi and the attack itself were two sides of the same coin. ""We are equating these acts together as incitement to hatred, incitement to violence. And we say we should not be hostages to extremists on either side,"" İhsanoğlu said. A year later, in a speech in Moscow, İhsanoğlu praised Resolution 16/18 for advancing the principle that freedom of expression did not include the right to defame any religion. He called the western concept, ""a ""twisted negative logic that is incomprehensible; that one exercises his freedom by insulting others, and not insulting just a few people, but insulting 1.6 billion people all over the world for no reason."" The record is clear. The governments of Islamic majority nations see no conflict between 16/18 and laws that ban cartoons of Mohammed or any other public act that might offend believers in Islam. A failed strategy? Adoption of the 16/18 resolution led to a series of meetings to put its lofty goals into practice. Turley’s op-ed referred to one such meeting held in Washington. On the issue of freedom of speech, those talks have yet to deliver the goods. Robert Blitt is an associate professor of law at the University of Tennessee College of Law and has studied this slice of international law very closely. Blitt told PunditFact that the process is faltering. ""The west is confronting the realization that the compromise effort that halted resolutions on defamation of religion and replaced them with an incitement-based approach did nothing to resolve the underlying, and still overriding, desire for the OIC to secure a prohibition on expression deemed defamatory of Islam,"" Blitt said. The American support for 16/18, Blitt said, probably bolstered the voices of moderate Muslim states that wanted to dial down the bad publicity they were getting with the defamation of religion resolutions. But Blitt said that tactic hasn’t shifted the Muslim position. ""I don’t think the administration is intentionally supporting efforts to establish a new blasphemy standard,"" Blitt said. ""However, its current stance represents an inadequate and miscalculated effort to create common ground."" This isn’t terribly far from Turley’s view. Turley told PunditFact that he has talked with administration officials about this. ""They always insisted that they were taking a different approach to try to moderate the Muslim countries,"" Turley said. The claim in his op-ed, Turley said, was not based on intentions, but results. And so far, the results, in his view, have been nill. Our ruling Turley said that the Obama administration ""supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard."" The accuracy of this statement hinges on how you understand that word ""supported."" American diplomats did endorse a UN resolution that avoided words about restricting speech that defamed a religion, but left open the door to criminalizing speech that was ""incitement to immediate violence based on religion."" The administration, as well as some free-speech advocacy groups, saw this as progress. But blasphemy laws remain on the books in Muslim nations, and the largest international body that speaks for those nations has said plainly that such laws are appropriate and ought to be adopted in the west. Not even Turley argues that this is the result the administration wanted, and another critic of the administration's strategy said American diplomats do not support efforts to establish an international blasphemy standard. One could argue that by participating in the ongoing negotiations, the administration has de facto endorsed a vehicle for the Muslim nations, but that is not the same as supporting their efforts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate the claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2015/jan/14/jonathan-turley/gw-law-prof-white-house-supported-muslim-allies-tr/

Marco Rubio in new book: People on welfare 'lose more in benefits than they would earn in salary'
","At the center of Sen. Marco Rubio’s new book, American Dreams, is the conservative idea that government stands in the way of lower- and middle-class Americans getting ahead. Why don’t more Americans start small businesses? Government regulation, Rubio says. Why do Americans pay so much for higher education? Government subsidies for students drive up prices. Why don’t low-income workers try to work more hours or strive for a promotion? Government assistance disincentivizes it. ""If (low-income) people work and make more money, they lose more in benefits than they would earn in salary,"" Rubio wrote in the book, released Jan. 13. This idea is at the heart of Rubio’s plan to tackle poverty, so it’s one we wanted to look at in depth. Welfare vs. work Government benefits for low-income individuals and families come in many forms: housing assistance, health care and money to purchase food, among others. Additionally, some states provide further assistance with local programs. These programs, reserved for poor people, tend to ramp down as income goes up, meaning the more money you make, the fewer benefits you receive. Makes sense. That phasedown, though, creates cliffs that sometime lessen the value of the increase in earnings. A similar effect occurs when people move into a higher tax bracket as their income goes up. Economists look at these changes in benefits and tax rates in terms of their impact on every additional dollar earned. When the impact is high, and a large chunk of the amount of every additional dollar earned goes to taxes or to offset a decrease in benefits, it can affect people’s desire to work more, said the Congressional Budget Office, the chief fiscal scorekeeper for lawmakers. This situation becomes an incentive for people ""already in the workforce to put in fewer hours or be less productive,"" the CBO said. Is it possible that the benefits lost could be so great, that a person would lose more in benefits than they would gain by an increase in wages? Sure. The Cato Institute, a libertarian policy shop, released a study in 2013 that made this exact point. By analyzing the total benefits an individual can receive in each state and from the federal government, they determined that in nine states assistance payouts exceeded $35,000 a year. Welfare paid better than a minimum wage job in 34 states, plus the District of Columbia, they reported. We asked Rubio’s office for more evidence, and we didn’t hear back. Under such a scenario, an individual could lose more by working than staying in their current situation. ‘Typical’ low-income family But what is that situation? To reach its headline-grabbing conclusions, Cato claims it focused on a typical welfare family. But the study focused on what a single mother with two children might qualify for. That’s an important distinction, and one that significantly alters the playing field. Single mothers with multiple children are eligible for considerably more benefits than poor individuals or married couples with no children. The report goes on to assume that the ""typical"" family receives seven different forms of public assistance, but that assumption is a pretty big leap. Here’s why: There are four main federal programs: Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (food stamps); Medicaid or Child Health Insurance Program (health care); Section 8 (housing assistance); and Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (welfare). According to the Congressional Budget Office in 2012, most families do not receive assistance from more than one of these programs. In fact, just a quarter of single parents with children earning up to 250 percent of the federal poverty line are enrolled in two of those programs. About 11 percent are enrolled in three or four. If we look at all low-income households of every size and makeup, then 17 percent of low-income households are enrolled in multiple federal programs and only 1 percent receive benefits from all four of them. So choosing to look at a single mother receiving benefits from seven programs, as Cato does, is an extreme example. Also, there are two widely used programs, the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, that actually increase benefits for very low-income individuals the more money that they make for their first $10,000 in wages. The benefits then ramp down after someone earns about $17,000 annually. This incentivizes and rewards poor parents who work more, and therefore it actually decreases the marginal tax rate for many low-income workers. In part because of these two tax credits, it is quite uncommon that someone would go from not working to working and lose more in benefits than they would gain in income. ‘Possible but rare’ Let’s go back to looking at this issue in terms of income lost on additional earnings. According to the Congressional Budget Office, there are very few instances when all 100 cents of an additional dollar earned would go to taxes and replacing lost benefits. In fact, among low- and moderate-income taxpayers, less than one percent lose 80 cents or more of every additional dollar earned. Those most affected would likely be individuals who earn near or just above the poverty level (about $20,000 in a three-person household), who are also enrolled in multiple benefit programs that are set to phase out with any additional income. This is not the norm. Most people earning at or near the poverty level lose about 30 percent in taxes and offset benefits on their additional income. Losing 100 percent of every dollar earned to taxes or replacing lost benefits is ""possible but rare,"" said Eugene Steuerle at the Urban Institute. ""High 40 to 60 percent rates are more common, and, if one adds in cost of transportation and clothing (not a tax but a loss from working), higher still."" It’s difficult to know when or how people factor lost benefits in their employment decisions, the Congressional Budget Office said. Benefits from government assistance programs are complex and determined by a multitude of factors, both financial (like salary, enrollment in other assistance programs) and nonfinancial (marital status, number of children). It would be hard for an individual to decide if working an extra few hours a week or taking that promotion is going to impact their benefits. Our ruling In his book, Rubio wrote, ""If people work and make more money, they lose more in benefits than they would earn in salary."" There is evidence that when a large chunk of the amount of every additional dollar earned goes to taxes or to offset a decrease in benefits, people work less. Further, there are scenarios where a low-income individual with children receiving assistance from the government through multiple programs could potentially lose more in benefits than he or she would gain by a slight or modest increase in income. But these examples are a small minority. The vast majority of people face some higher taxes and lost benefits when they make more money, but they would still take home more in pay than they would under a lower salary.

U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore ridicules Mitch McConnell for crediting GOP Senate wins for economic rebound
","On Jan. 9, 2015, two days after a new Congress was sworn in, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore tweaked new Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell with this tweet: ""McConnell credits @GOP for recent econ improvements despite just gaining Senate control days ago. #RevisionistHistory"" Sounds pretty silly. An economic recovery occurring just because Republicans took over the Senate days earlier? So, did the Kentucky Republican really say what the Milwaukee Democrat said he did? Just about. McConnell’s claim Moore reacted to comments McConnell made two days earlier on the Senate floor, after he took over as majority leader: ""After so many years of sluggish growth, we’re finally starting to see some economic data that can provide a glimmer of hope. The uptick appears to coincide with the biggest political change of the Obama administration’s long tenure in Washington: the expectation of a new Republican Congress."" So, McConnell was saying a recent economic uptick appears to ""coincide"" with ""the expectation of a new Republican Congress."" PolitiFact National rated that McConnell claim False, even leaving aside the question of whether McConnell was crediting the GOP for the uptick.

Moore’s claim Moore’s characterization of McConnell’s remark went a bit further. She said McConnell was crediting the GOP for a recovery because it had taken control of the Senate ""days ago."" But that expectation would have been in place a couple of months earlier, following the elections -- or perhaps a couple of months before that, as it became clear the GOP would win back the Senate.

He said he'd pursue it, but opted out
","
- Barack Obama, fall 2007
 

""We've made the decision not to participate in the public financing system for the general election.""

 
- Barack Obama, June 19, 2008
 
Sen. Barack Obama's decision to opt out of the public financing system marked a milestone in modern presidential politics: the first time a major nominee has declined public financing since the system was created after Watergate. Obama's announcement on June 19, 2008, prompted swift criticism from Sen. John McCain's campaign that Obama had flip-flopped.
 
""The true test of a candidate for president is whether he will stand on principle and keep his word to the American people,"" said McCain communications director Jill Hazelbaker. ""Barack Obama has failed that test today, and his reversal of his promise to participate in the public finance system undermines his call for a new type of politics."" The group Let Freedom Ring made a similar charge in July 2008 with a TV ad.
 
When we talk about public financing, we're talking about candidates agreeing to skip private fundraising and instead run their campaigns using a pot of public money that comes from taxpayers who direct $3 to the fund on their tax returns. The upside is that candidates don't have to spend time seeking contributions, but the downside is that their spending is limited to an amount set by the Federal Election Commission. This year's general election limit is $84.1-million per candidate, but the spending period is limited to the two months between the nominating conventions in late August and early September, and the Nov. 4 election.
 
To explore whether Obama made a full flip-flop, let's go back a year to 2007 shortly before he announced his candidacy.
 
On Feb. 1, 2007, Obama requested an opinion of the FEC on whether he could privately raise money for the general election but reserve the right to use public financing if he returned what he had raised. A month later, the FEC issued an advisory opinion that said it was okay as long as his campaign kept the primary election contributions and the general election contributions separate.
 
The day of the FEC decision, McCain's campaign said he would commit to public financing. ""Should John McCain win the Republican nomination, we will agree to accept public financing in the general election, if the Democratic nominee agrees to do the same,"" Terry Nelson, McCain's campaign manager, told the

New York Times.

 
Obama campaign spokesman Bill Burton responded by saying: ""If Senator Obama is the nominee, he will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.""
 
In the fall of 2007, Obama elaborated on his position when he answered a questionnaire sent by the Midwest Democracy Network, which asked the candidates if they would participate in public financing.""
""Yes,"" Obama said in his response. ""In February 2007, I proposed a novel way to preserve the strength of the public financing system in the 2008 election. My plan requires both major party candidates to agree on a fundraising truce, return excess money from donors, and stay within the public financing system for the general election. ... The Federal Election Commission ruled the proposal legal, and Sen. John McCain has already pledged to accept this fundraising pledge. If I am the Democratic nominee, I will aggressively pursue an agreement with the Republican nominee to preserve a publicly financed general election.""
 
The message seemed clear: Obama and McCain wanted a publicly funded general election. But then both campaigns saw tactical advantages to getting out of the public financing system.
 
McCain filed a letter with the Federal Election Commission on Feb. 6, 2008, saying he wanted to withdraw from public funding for the primaries. McCain's private fundraising had improved after his early primary victories, and his strategists were concerned that they would be hamstrung by spending limits if they stayed in the public system.
 
But that effort stalled because of vacancies on the FEC. Chairman David M. Mason sent a letter to McCain on Feb. 19, 2008, saying he needs four members seated to make a ruling.
 
Obama repeated his commitment in a Feb. 26, 2008, debate in Cleveland, Ohio, when moderators pushed him to explain why voters shouldn't consider his position on public financing to have changed.
 
""What I've said is, at the point where I'm the nominee, at the point where it's appropriate, I will sit down with John McCain and make sure that we have a system that works for everybody.""
 
In the meantime, Obama's campaign had benefited from an unprecedented tidal wave of private contributions, especially from donors who gave less than $200. The small contributions not only fueled the campaign in the early primaries, but the donors could be tapped again (and again) before they hit the $2,300 limit for individuals.
 
As they considered their plans for the general election, a factor for both campaigns was the money spent by independent groups known as 527s, named after the section of the tax code that governs them. Groups on both sides are expected to spend tens of millions of dollars, but the spending could become lopsided to the benefit of one candidate, either because favorable groups buy lots of ads touting him or they buy lots of ads attacking his opponent.
 
In either case, the candidate on the losing side of 527 spending would be at a significant disadvantage if he was using public financing for his campaign and had to adhere to spending limits.
 
So as the money flowed in, Obama campaign strategists made a calculation: They decided they could raise so much from private contributions that they were better off avoiding the public system.
 
""It's not an easy decision, and especially because I support a robust system of public financing of elections,"" Obama said in a video to supporters. ""But the public financing of presidential elections as it exists today is broken, and we face opponents who've become masters at gaming this broken system.""
He said McCain's campaign and the Republican National Committee are largely bankrolled by ""Washington lobbyists and special interest PACs. And we've already seen that (McCain is) not going to stop the smears and attacks from his allies running so-called 527 groups, who will spend millions and millions of dollars in unlimited donations.""
 
Asked whether they pursued an agreement with McCain, the Obama campaign pointed us to

a news account

that said Bob Bauer, an attorney for Obama, met with McCain lawyers to discuss how both campaigns could operate in the public financing system.
 
But that account was sketchy and didn't sound to us like the ""aggressive pursuit"" that Obama had promised. The fact is that Obama said he would pursue public financing, but decided it wasn't in the campaign's tactical interest. That might have been a tactical decision, or even a wise one, but we see it as a Full Flop.

McCain's cheerleading for drilling is new
","In an interview with the

News-Leader

in Springfield, Mo., on June 18, 2008, Sen. John McCain was asked about his recent push for offshore oil drilling.
 
""You have changed your thoughts on that, am I correct?""
 
""No,"" McCain said. ""I've always said it's up to the states and I still say that.""
 
The interview came a day after McCain's headline-making speech in Houston in which he made a pitch for lifting a federal moratorium on offshore drilling.
 
So McCain says it's not a switch, but is it? We wanted to find out if he has consistently said it's up to the individual states to decide whether to drill off their coasts.
 
Here's the rest of McCain's answer to the question:
 
""But if the states want to drill offshore, and I hope they do. ... Gasoline prices have gone from a buck and a quarter to four dollars and it's even going to go higher, according to some. I think we have to explore all of the options that we have, and review them.
 
""And I think offshore oil exploration and natural gas exploration is a good thing to do. But the states would still make the decision.""
 
Opponents have said McCain was once a proponent of the federal moratorium on offshore drilling. But McCain's record is not so clear. About the closest we could come to finding an inconsistency in McCain's position was two newspaper articles from the presidential race in 1999 — one from the

San Francisco Chronicle,

the other from the

Ventura County (Calif.) Star

— in which the reporters paraphrase McCain's position as supporting the moratorium on offshore drilling. In 2000, the Associated Press listed McCain's position on offshore drilling as ""Supports state wishes over federal fiat in oil drilling.""
 
Here's a sampling of McCain quotes about offshore drilling, starting with ones made when he ran for president in 2000.
 
• ""Ronald Reagan believed ... that states should have enormous input into the decisions that directly concern them. This directly concerns the people of California, this decision on offshore oil drilling. Now, off of this coast of Texas, I understand Texans want offshore oil drilling. That's fine with me. Off Florida, they don't. I think that we should allow these decisions, to some degree to be made — significant degree to be made by the people who are directly affected by them."" McCain during an interview on ABC News'

This Week,

Feb. 27, 2000.
 
• ""The leases for offshore oil drilling should never have been granted without allowing Californians a legitimate voice in the decisionmaking process. I believe it is up to the voters of California to determine the fate of these leases, and as president, I will respect the decision they make regarding the leases. The people of California deserve to be heard, without being forced to resort to legal action against their own government. As president, I will see to it that the interests of the people of California rise above the special interests of Washington."" McCain to the Associated Press in March 2000.
 
• ""I wouldn't drill off the coast of Florida unless the people of Florida wanted to. And I wouldn't drill off the coast of California unless the people of California wanted to. And I wouldn't drill in the Grand Canyon unless the people in Arizona wanted to."" McCain during a Republican presidential debate in Dearborn, Mich., Oct. 9, 2007.
 
• ""Look, I'm a federalist, and I believe the states should decide to enormous degrees what happens within those states, including off their coasts. The people of California have decided they don't want oil drilling off their coasts. The people of Louisiana have decided that they do."" McCain during a Republican presidential debate in Simi Valley, Calif., on Jan. 30, 2008.
 
Here's what McCain said in Houston on June 17, 2008:
 
""With gasoline running at more than four bucks a gallon, many do not have the luxury of waiting on the far-off plans of futurists and politicians. We have proven oil reserves of at least 21-billion barrels in the United States. But a broad federal moratorium stands in the way of energy exploration and production. And I believe it is time for the federal government to lift these restrictions and to put our own reserves to use.
 
""We can do this in ways that are consistent with sensible standards of environmental protection. And in states that choose to permit exploration, there must be an appropriate sharing of benefits between federal and state governments. But as a matter of fairness to the American people, and a matter of duty for our government, we must deal with the here and now, and assure affordable fuel for America by increasing domestic production.""
 
We should note one anomaly in McCain's position. Unlike many of his Republican counterparts in the Senate, McCain has long been opposed to drilling in Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, even though most Alaska residents support it.
 
In Houston, McCain explained why ANWR is a special case.
 
""Quite rightly, I believe, we confer a special status on some areas of our country that are best left undisturbed,"" McCain said. ""When America set aside the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, we called it a 'refuge' for a reason.""
 
As for McCain's voting record on offshore drilling, it's a bit mixed.
 
In June 2003, McCain was among 10 Republicans who voted for an amendment proposed by Democratic Florida Sen. Bob Graham that would have called off a survey and inventory of possible offshore oil and natural gas deposits. It failed.
 
In August 2006, McCain voted in favor of a bill that authorized drilling in about 8.3-million acres of the eastern Gulf of Mexico, off the coasts of Alabama, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. The bill, which passed handily, also established a 125-mile buffer until 2022 for energy development in Gulf waters off the Florida coast, and extended the moratorium on energy exploration and development in the Gulf from 2012 to 2022.
 
As for ANWR, McCain voted yes on a 2006 procedural measure that protected legislation opening up the Arctic refuge; but he voted for an amendment to strike language that would have done the same in the previous year's budget resolution.
 
Nowhere in those previously listed interviews or speeches prior to Houston does McCain actively

advocate

for states to institute offshore drilling. Nor does he talk about creating incentives to encourage them to do it, as he did in Houston. That's why the speech made for front-page headlines.
 
Yes, McCain has long been in favor of letting states ultimately decide whether to drill, but he's now become a cheerleader for the cause. If it's not a change in position, it's at least a change in posture. So we rate McCain's position a Half Flip.

McCain used to oppose tax cuts
","Sen. John McCain was one of the few Republicans who opposed tax cuts proposed by President George W. Bush in 2001, and he opposed them again when they came up for renewal in 2003.
 
In 2001, McCain voted against a $1.35-trillion tax cut package, arguing that the tax cuts didn't do enough for the middle class, and because of a need for increased defense spending.
 
Two years later, McCain again citied fiscal prudence for opposing $350-billion in additional tax cuts, specifically citing the unknown costs for the war in Iraq.
 
""No one can be expected to make an informed decision about fiscal policy at this time,"" McCain said. ""Let us wait until we have succeeded in Iraq.""
 
When they came up for renewal again in 2006, though, he voted in favor of them.
 
McCain said he supported the tax-cut extensions, which also reduced tax rates on capital gains and dividend income, because ""American businesses and investors need a stable and predictable tax policy to continue contributing to the growth of our economy. These considerations lead me to the conclusion that we should not reverse course by letting higher tax rates take effect.""
 
In an interview on Fox News on Dec. 28, 2007, McCain expressed no regrets about his tax votes against Bush. He said he would have preferred a plan that included spending cuts as well as tax cuts, but added that he believes the tax cuts should now be made permanent.
 
""I had significant tax cuts, and there was restraint of spending included in my proposal,"" McCain said during the appearance on

Hannity & Colmes

. ""I saw no restraint in spending. We presided over the greatest increase in the size of government since the Great Society. Spending went completely out of control. It's still out of control. Wasteful earmark spending is a disgrace, and it caused us to alienate our Republican base. So these tax cuts need to be made permanent. Otherwise, they would have the effect of tax increases. But, look, if we had gotten spending under control, we'd be talking about more tax cuts today.""
 
Justifications aside, this is an actual change of position for McCain, so we rate his change on the Bush tax cuts a Full Flop.

Bush didn't repeal it; Obama would expand it
","A chain e-mail claims that Sen. Barack Obama intends to raise pretty much all your taxes, while Sen. John McCain will leave them alone. The problem is that most of the e-mail's detailed assertions are false.
 
Here, we'll look at the e-mail's claims about Barack Obama and the estate tax, which it refers to as the inheritance tax. For an examination of the e-mail's other claims, read

our full article here

.
 
The e-mail claims that President George W. Bush ""repealed"" the estate tax, and it now stands at 0 percent. Though Bush reduced the tax, he did not repeal it. Rather, under his 2001 tax cut package, the estate tax reduces every year and then goes away for just a single year — 2010 — before reverting back to higher rates. (See the nonpartisan

Tax Policy Center on estate taxes

for more details.)
 
Currently, the estate tax generally applies only to estates worth more than $2-million (or $4-million for couples). Above those amounts, the tax rate tops out at 45 percent. Both Obama and McCain support renewing the current estate tax with a few changes. McCain proposes to increase the exemption to $5-million ($10-million for couples) and reduce the tax rate to 15 percent. Obama proposes to increase the exemption to $3.5-million ($7-million for couples) and leave the top rate at 45 percent.
 
So the e-mail is wrong when it says McCain wants a ""0 percent"" estate tax and that Obama wants to ""restore"" it. We rule this statement False.

Not Obama's policy
","A chain e-mail claims that Sen. Barack Obama intends to raise pretty much all your taxes, while Sen. John McCain will leave them alone. The problem is that most of the e-mail's detailed assertions are false.
 
Here, we'll look at the e-mail's claims about home sales. For an examination of the e-mail's other claims, read

our full article here

.
 
The e-mail says McCain will leave the existing capital gains taxes at 0 percent on home sales of up to $500,000 per home for couples, while Obama proposes a 28 percent tax on all home sales.
 
""If you are heading toward retirement and would like to down-size your home or move into a retirement community, 28% of the money you make from your home will go to taxes,"" the e-mail states.
 
First, let's briefly explain what capital gains taxes are. A capital asset is ""almost everything you own and use for personal purposes, pleasure or investment,"" says the Internal Revenue Service. If you sell an asset and make a profit on it, that's a capital gain. Capital gains taxes vary depending on the tax filer's income and how long they held the asset, but generally taxes on capital gains are measured by the long-term rate for upper income tax brackets. Currently that rate is 15 percent.
 
There are exemptions to the capital gains tax, however, and one of the best-known exemptions is on home sales. In general, if you own your home and sell it for a profit, you are not taxed on the first $250,000 of profit if you are single, or on the first $500,000 of profit if you are a married couple. Neither McCain nor Obama have proposed changing this exemption.
 
The e-mail says that McCain supports capital gains taxes of ""0 percent on home sales of up to $500,000 per home for couples."" Technically, this is inaccurate, because the sales price on its own doesn't matter. It's the

profit

that matters (what you paid for the home minus what you're selling it for). Profits up to $500,000 per couple are exempt, no matter what the sales price.
 
The e-mail states ""Obama will charge a 28 percent tax on all home sales."" That's wrong. Obama intends to keep the same exemption for home sales as McCain. Most home sales under Obama's plan would also be taxed at 0 percent, unless, as we explained, profits on the home sale are more than $250,000 for a single person or $500,000 for couples.
 
We don't want to give the impression that there is no difference between the two candidates on capital gains tax, but the e-mail gets all the details wrong. The true difference is that McCain intends to leave the long-term capital gains tax at 15 percent, while Obama intends to raise it to about 25 percent for taxpayers reporting income of $250,000 or more per year.
 
But when it comes to home sales with the profits described above, McCain and Obama's policies are the same. The e-mail's statement that Obama will charge a 28 percent tax on all home sales is False.

Obama cites ethnicity in mortgage crisis
","In a town hall in St. Petersburg, Fla., an audience member challenged Obama about speaking out on issues affecting the black community, including the subprime mortgage crisis, among other issues.
 
""Why is it that you have not had the ability to not one time speak to the interests and even speak on behalf of the oppressed and exploited African community or the black community in this country?"" the man asked.
 
Not true, Obama replied. ""I think you're misinformed about when you say not one time. Every issue you've spoken about, I actually did speak out on,"" Obama said.
 
""I have repeatedly said that many of the predatory loans that were made in the mortgage system did target African-American and Latino communities,"" Obama said. He went on to defend his record on other civil rights issues.
 
We wondered if Obama's statement on the subprime mortgage was true, so we looked through press releases, transcripts and news stories to find out.
 
Most notably, on Oct. 18, 2007, Obama wrote a letter to the Federal Trade Commission asking it to investigate subprime lenders to determine whether minority borrowers have been victims of discrimination.
 
Obama wrote in his leter that there was already substantial evidence to indicate this was so.
 
""Black families are paying more for home loans than similarly situated white families. Effective action to address this disparity is long overdue,"" Obama wrote.
 
On the campaign trail, Obama has also discussed the same issue several times, though we found most of our examples of him discussing it before Hispanic audiences.
 
On June 28, 2008, Obama told the National Association of Latino Elected and Appointed Officials, ""We have to stabilize the housing market. And the Latino community as well as the African-American community was particularly hard hit when it comes to foreclosures.""
 
On Feb. 19, 2008, Obama was at a campaign event in San Antonio, Texas, and discussed the need for people having mortgage problems to receive help negotiating with their lenders. ""My suspicion is that it's very important we have Spanish-speaking counselors because I know that both the African-American community and Hispanic community have been disproportionately targeted by some of these practices.""
 
It's not a campaign theme he hits over and over again, but Obama has made the statement several times, and the 2007 letter is particularly strong evidence to bolster Obama's argument. We rule his statement True.

Obama right about increased energy costs
","In a town hall meeting in St. Petersburg, Fla., on Aug. 1, 2008, Sen. Barack Obama announced a proposal for a two-part emergency plan ""to help struggling families make ends meet and get our economy back on track.""
 
One part is a $50-billion stimulus package that would be split: $25-billion to go to state governments facing big budget shortfalls; and $25-billion toward national infrastructure projects like highways and bridges.
 
The other part of his emergency plan is a $1,000 energy rebate that he said ""could go out to families as soon as this fall.""
 
""This rebate will be enough to offset the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months. Or, if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter, it will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills. Or you could use the rebate for any of your other bills or even to pay down debt.""
 
Obama said he plans to pay for the rebate by taxing windfall profits of oil companies.
 
We decided to check Obama's math, to see if his numbers were right about how far $1,000 would go this winter.
 
First up, the increased cost of gas for a working family over the next four months. According to Energy Department figures for the latest available year, 2001, an average family household of four people consumed 1,519 gallons of gas a year. That comes to 506 gallons for four months.
 
Now, here comes the tricky part, because while Obama refers to the increased cost of gas, he doesn't say between when and when. The national average for the price of gas on Aug. 1 was $3.90 a gallon; up from $2.86 on Aug. 1 last year. That's a $1.04 increase. At those prices, the increased cost this year for four months of gas would come to $526, which would obviously be covered by Obama's proposed $1,000 rebate. Even if you project out the increased cost based on the peak price of $4.11 a gallon on July 17, it only comes to an extra $632.50 for the next four months. So that part of Obama's equation is accurate.
 
Next, we looked at whether, if you live in a state where it gets very cold in the winter, $1,000 will be enough to cover the entire increase in your heating bills.
 
The National Energy Assistance Directors' Association tracks such things.
 
In New England states, the association projects the additional cost for people who use home heating oil will be about $950. About half of New England's homes use home heating oil.
 
For those with natural gas, the added cost is projected to be about $335 higher; $450 more for people who use propane; and $780 more for those who use electricity. So no matter what form of energy they use to heat their homes, Obama's rebate would cover it.
 
""The numbers are just ridiculous,"" said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors' Association. ""It's going to be really bad in cold weather states. People up there are in a total panic.""
 
Consider this stat: for a New England family making $50,000 a year, energy costs last winter ate up 22 percent of their overall pre-tax income; this winter it is projected to consume 38 percent.
""How are these families going to make it through the winter?"" Wolfe asked.
 
Wolfe said a $1,000 rebate would help many struggling families buy time to transition to the higher costs.
 
We find that Obama's numbers on increased energy costs are True.

Letters don't amount to intervening
","
An independent political group called Campaign Money Watch has begun airing a TV ad that paints Sen. John McCain as a bought-and-paid-for politician who swung a lucrative defense contract to a European company over an American competitor.
 
The issue is McCain's role in a highly contentious and much-publicized battle over a contract to build a fleet of air refueling tankers for the Air Force. Chicago-based Boeing has been at odds with a rival bidder, a partnership between U.S.-based Northrop Grumman and European Aeronautic Defense and Space Company (EADS), the parent company of Airbus.
 
To the surprise of many, Airbus was awarded the roughly $40-billion contract in March 2008, but the General Accounting Office upheld a protest from Boeing, concluding that the Air Force made a number of errors in the bidding process. The contract will now be re-bid.
 
What's interesting about this attack is that McCain's role in this particular defense project has long been seen as one of taxpayer hero. The whole reason there was a competitive bid for a contract to build the tankers is because McCain led a charge to scrap the Air Force's original plan, which was to lease jetliners from Boeing. As McCain made noise, government studies concluded that costs for the lease plan had been vastly underestimated. People were fired, some went to jail. It was a big scandal, and McCain has rightly claimed credit for it on the trail.
 
None of that background appears in the ad. The ad claims McCain's campaign helped steer the contract toward Airbus, thereby selling out thousands of U.S. workers.
 
First the ad notes that McCain has accepted contributions from Airbus executives and that former Airbus lobbyists were working on his campaign.

We ruled this claim True.

 
Then the announcer in the ad states, ""And guess what? John McCain intervened, which helped Airbus get that Pentagon contract.""
 
In September 2006, McCain sent two letters to Defense Department officials about factors they should or should not consider in deciding the contract. Specifically, he urged them to ignore lawsuits currently before the World Trade Organization between the United States and the European Union about government subsidies for aircraft manufacturers. Boeing claimed government subsidies gave Airbus an unfair advantage. McCain argued that to include the lawsuits as an evaluation factor would detract from the competition by adding ""an element of arbitrariness and capriciousness."" It would also be unprecedented, he said.
 
So does that amount to intervening? Did it help Airbus get the contract? And did the promise of campaign contributions influence McCain?
 
Keith Ashdown, of Taxpayers for Common Sense, doesn't think so.
 
""The word 'intervening' is not a word I would use,"" he said. ""He was making sure there was a competition.""
 
Besides, he said, McCain didn't have a vote on who got the contract, so he didn't have the power to steer it to either company. It wasn't his call.
 
""Intervening"" is a subjective term. Some would say two letters arguing against subsidy disputes not being included in the bid competition constitutes intervening. But to imply those letters swung the contract in Airbus' favor overstates McCain's influence.
 
We rate the claim Barely True.

No tax offered on electricity
","
A television ad from Sen. John McCain got attention because it contrasted photos of Sen. Barack Obama with tabloid stars Britney Spears and Paris Hilton. ""He's the biggest celebrity in the world,"" the ad's narrator said. ""But, is he ready to lead? With gas prices soaring, Barack Obama says no to offshore drilling. And, says he'll raise taxes on electricity.
 
""Higher taxes, more foreign oil, that's the real Obama,"" the voice concludes.
 
We know that Obama

does not support

expanded offshore drilling, because he says it won't do anything to reduce gas prices. But we were intrigued by the claim that Obama wants to raise taxes on electricity. That's not something we recalled from his policy proposals.
 
In a prepared memo in support of the ad, the McCain campaign pointed to an interview Obama had with a Texas newspaper in February 2008.
 
""What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas,"" Obama said in the interview. The McCain campaign argued that because coal and natural gas are major sources of electricity, Obama supports a tax on electricity.
 
But the context of the interview (which

we've looked at before

) shows Obama was making a statement of principle rather than a policy proposal.
 
In the interview with

San Antonio Express-News

columnist Carlos Guerra, Obama discussed funding sources for education. Guerra then asked, ""Have you considered other funding sources, say taxing emerging energy forms, for example, say a penny per kilowatt hour on wind energy?""
 
Obama replied: ""Well, that's clean energy, and we want to drive down the cost of that, not raise it. We need to give them subsidies so they can start developing that. What we ought to tax is dirty energy, like coal and, to a lesser extent, natural gas. But I think that the real way to fund education is for local communities to step up and say this is important to us. There are no shortcuts.""
 
If you look at Obama's proposals, he does not advocate an electricity tax or a carbon tax, but instead proposes a cap-and-trade system. A campaign spokesman said that was what Obama was talking about in the interview.
 
The idea behind cap-and-trade is that the government sets a limit on how much carbon industries can emit (the cap). The government then issues permits to companies and allows them to buy and sell the permits as needed so they can conduct business (the trade). If the policy works as planned, overall emissions decline, companies determine for themselves the best way to lower emissions, and the free market rewards those who lower emissions most effectively.
 
Cap-and-trade systems can raise the cost of energy for some consumers if companies have to buy additional permits for emissions, but they are not usually considered a tax. McCain, incidentally, also supports a cap-and-trade system.
 
""It wouldn't officially be considered a tax,"" said Eric Toder of the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. ""The proposal for a cap-and-trade system would raise prices for some people, but both candidates support cap-and-trade.""
 
Yes, Obama did use the word ""tax"" in the interview, but he was reacting to a question about taxing clean energy and making the point that producers of clean energy should not be given a disincentive. And he concluded that energy taxes should not be used to fund education.
 
The McCain ad says that Obama ""says he'll raise taxes on electricity"" and points to a line from one interview that requires a lot of explanation. Obama's proposals don't say anything about a tax on electricity. Is Obama open to the idea of taxing dirty energy? Arguably yes. But that's some distance from saying he wants to tax electricity. We find the statement Barely True.

McCain campaign bouyed by Airbus execs and lobbyists

None of that background appears in the ad. The ad claims McCain's campaign has been too cozy with Airbus.
 
An announcer in the TV ad states: ""Seven of McCain's staff and fundraisers lobbied for Airbus"" and ""McCain got more money from Airbus' U.S. executives than any other politician.""
 
The ad is on target when it calls out McCain for having seven campaign staffers and fundraisers who lobbied for Airbus; and for accepting contributions from Airbus executives.
 
Former McCain finance chairman Thomas G. Loeffler's firm lobbied for Airbus parent company EADS. Loeffler's lobbying ties led to his departure from the McCain campaign in March. Susan E. Nelson left Loeffler's lobbying firm to be McCain's finance director. William L. Ball III, a former secretary of the Navy and frequent McCain surrogate, and John Green, who took a leave from Ogilvy Public Relations to serve as McCain's legislative liaison, also have lobbied for EADS. And three McCain fundraising bundlers — Kirk Blalock, Kirsten Chadwick and Aleix Jarvis — are with Fierce Isakowitz & Blalock, which has done lobbying work for EADS, according to campaign finance records at Opensecrets.org and Public Citizen.
 
As for political contributions, the ad states that ""McCain got more money from Airbus' U.S. executives than any other politician.""
 
The Center for Responsive Politics prepared a report for PolitiFact that backs that up. U.S. employees of EADS/Airbus have contributed $15,700 in this election cycle to McCain's campaign. The next highest recipient was Mark Warner, a Democratic candidate for the U.S. Senate, who has gotten $2,800. Barack Obama has gotten $2,650. Neither McCain nor Obama has gotten any money from Airbus PACs, which have spread around $123,000 to 22 congressional candidates this election cycle.
 
Given those numbers, we rule this claim True.

Just call him Wild Barack Obama
","In a packed town hall in Springfield, Mo., Sen. Barack Obama laid down the challenge for a duel.
 
His eyes weren't exactly squinting. And theme music to

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

could not be heard. But the gauntlet was dropped.
 
""I'm ready to duel John McCain on taxes,"" Obama said. ""Right here. Right now.""
 
Then Obama surprised the crowd.
""I don't know if people are aware of the fact,"" Obama said, ""but the family legend is that Wild Bill Hickok, he's a distant cousin of mine.""
 

The crowd roared with laughter. It seemed that perhaps the sun had gotten to him.
 
""I'm serious, I'm serious,"" Obama said. ""I don't know if it's true, but that's the family legend. But we're going to research that.""
 
No need, Sen. Obama. We called the New England Historic Genealogical Society. These are the folks who back in March released the study that found that Obama is a distant relative of actor Brad Pitt (ninth cousins, to be exact).
 
Chris Child, a staff genealogist, compared geneological charts for Obama and Hickok and...bang...there it was. The two trees intersected with one Thomas Blossom of Holland, who arrived in Plymouth, Mass., in 1629.
 
The two are sixth cousins

six

times removed, Child said. Whatever that means.
 
Seems quite a length for Obama to go to support a metaphor about dueling with your opponent over taxes, but then Hickok was also a noted gambler.
 
Obama also said that Hickok, the legendary frontier lawman, had his first duel in Springfield, Mo. While we were digging we looked that up, too. And Obama is right again. While it's hard for many historians to separate fact from legend, it is documented that James Butler Hickok (his name wasn't even William) got the better of former Confederate Army soldier Davis Tutt in a 1865 ""quick draw"" duel after a dispute involving gambling debts and, you guessed it, a woman.
 
In the ensuing years, Hickok boasted of killing more than 100 men. Though in his defense, he said they all had it coming.
 
Hickok got his in 1876 after he apparently broke the cardinal rule of gunfighters: He sat with his back to the door and was shot from behind while playing poker at a saloon in Deadwood, S.D. The story was that he was holding two pairs, aces and eights — hence the term ""dead man's hand"" still used today.
 
The relation to ""Wild Bill"" Hickok is way cooler than the revelations earlier this year that Obama is distantly related to none other than vice president Dick Cheney. Undoubtedly, Obama took a lot of ribbing over that. Maybe those jokesters ought to sleep with one eye open because Obama's ""family legend"" is correct. We rule the statement True.

No fresh evidence of what McCain would do
","A new

television advertisement

by a veterans group has harsh words for Sen. John McCain, saying he doesn't believe in freedom when it comes to Iraqis.
 
The ad by VoteVets.org, which the group unveiled on July 23, 2008 and set to air on CNN and MSNBC, features a man identified as ""Brandon Woods, Iraq War Veteran.""
 
""What do we fight for in Iraq?"" he says, staring solemnly into the camera. ""I have some idea.""
 
""I fought in Operation Iraqi Freedom. And freedom means that when the Iraqi people and their prime minister ask us to make a plan to leave, we do. But Sen. McCain would occupy Iraq indefinitely, against their wishes.""
 
""That's not what freedom means. That's not what we fought for,"" Woods concludes. ""Senator, I thought you would know better.""
 
We have chosen to check the ad's most provocative claim, that McCain would ""occupy Iraq indefinitely, against their wishes.""
 
We should start by noting that the United States and the United Nations do not consider the current U.S. presence in Iraq an ""occupation"" — in their view the occupation ended in June 2004 when the United States and its coalition powers handed authority to an Iraqi government.
 
""After 2004, the Security Council ceased to regard the situation on the ground as an occupation,"" said U.N. spokesman Farhan Haq. ""The secretary [general] went along with that.""
 
VoteVets.org said it accepts that the current situation is not an occupation.
 
But the group said it would become one again if the Iraqi government asked us to leave and we refused. And they said McCain has indicated he would not withdraw even if the Iraqis asked us to.
 
We'll buy the first part of that.
 
If the United States continues, against the will of the Iraq government, operating out of any significant number of the 30 or so major military bases it currently has in Iraq, that would constitute the sort of control and authority over Iraqi territory required to meet the

dictionary definition

— and

international law definition

— of an occupation.
 
That leaves us with the question of whether McCain really would leave forces in Iraq against the wishes of the Iraqi government.
 
In 2004, McCain said he would do nothing of the kind.
 
""What would or should we do if, in the post-June 30 period, a so-called sovereign Iraqi government asks us to leave, even if we are unhappy with the security situation there?"" Peter Peterson, chairman of the Council on Foreign Relations, a nonpartisan think tank,

asked him

.
 
""Well, if that scenario evolves, then I think it's obvious that we would have to leave,"" McCain replied.
 
There was little chance of that happening at the time. Lately though, the situation has changed.
 
Iraqi officials, including Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki, have expressed support for a withdrawal timetable such as the 16-month one that Sen. Barack Obama has advocated.
 
""Obama's remarks that — if he takes office — in 16 months he would withdraw the forces, we think that this period could increase or decrease a little, but that it could be suitable to end the presence of the forces in Iraq,"" Maliki said in a July 19 interview with the German magazine

Der Spiegel,

according to a

New York Times translation

.
 
Confronted with this new development, McCain continued to defer to the Iraqis in some respects, saying, ""I think it's a pretty good timetable, as we should — or horizons for withdrawal. But they have to be based on conditions on the ground.""
 
But what if the Iraqis decide they want us out regardless of conditions on the ground? Would McCain still withdraw?
 
CNN's Wolf Blitzer recently pressed him on just that point.
 
""If you were president and Nuri al-Maliki is still the elected prime minister of Iraq, and he says he wants all U.S. troops out, what do you do?"" Blitzer

asked McCain

on July 27, 2008.
 
""Well, first of all, I know Prime Minister Maliki rather well,"" McCain replied. ""I know that he is a politician, and I know that they are looking at upcoming elections. I know that he knows and every — and the other leaders know there that it has to be condition-based, any withdrawals — which, we will withdraw. We have succeeded. The surge has succeeded. And we're on the road to victory. And we will be out of there. And we may have a residual presence of some kind, as I've always said, but the fact is, the surge has succeeded. … So I can assure you that Prime Minister Maliki understands that conditions have to be kept. ... we're not going to go down that road (of unconditional withdrawal).""
 
""What — but if Maliki persists?"" Blitzer said. ""You're president, and he says he wants U.S. troops out and he wants them out, let's say, in a year or two years or 16 months, or whatever, what do you do? Do you just — do you listen to the prime minister?""
 
""He won't,"" McCain said. ""He won't. He won't, because he —""
 
""How do you know? How do you know? How do you know that?"" Blitzer interjected.
 
""— knows that it has to be condition-based,"" McCain continued. ""Because I know him, and I know him very well. And I know the other leaders. And I know — I've been there eight times, as you know. And I know them very, very well.""
 
""Why do you think he said that 16 months is basically a pretty good timetable?"" Blitzer asked.
 
""He said it's a pretty good timetable based on conditions on the ground,"" McCain said.
 
So rather than answering the question directly, as he did in 2004, McCain did not accept the premise that the Iraqi government might want the United States out regardless of security conditions. Instead, he said Maliki had made his timetable dependent on conditions on the ground.
 
We were not able to find any such qualification by Maliki — in his public comments he has not been specific about the sort of timetable he wants. The McCain campaign did not respond to our request to provide evidence for McCain's characterization of Maliki's position.
 
But we're not fact-checking McCain here (we do plenty of that elsewhere). We're fact-checking VoteVets.
 
And to support

its

claim, the group pointed us to instances such as the Blitzer interview, where McCain insisted that both he and Maliki want a conditions-based withdrawal.
 
VoteVets made the point that McCain dodged the question of what he would do if Maliki wanted an unconditional withdrawal.
 
And he did. But McCain dodging the question is not the same as him saying he would leave U.S. forces in Iraq regardless of what Iraqis wanted. Politicians often dodge hypothetical questions, and they have all kinds of reasons for doing so.
 
The only clear statement from McCain on what he would do if Iraqis tried to kick us out — as far as we could find — was when he said, ""It's obvious we would have to leave.""
 
It's noteworthy that McCain won't answer the question these days. We understand VoteVets' concern. But the group doesn't have enough ammunition for its claim that McCain ""would occupy Iraq indefinitely, against their wishes."" The only solid evidence — stale as it may be, having come in 2004 — indicates otherwise. So we find the claim to be False.

"['National', 'Candidate Biography', 'John McCain']","
If you look at one narrow source
","It's an old standby of GOP presidential politics to paint Democratic opponents as liberals who are out of step with the American mainstream.
 
Sen. John McCain took up that line of attack against Sen. Barack Obama this month in an interview with the

Kansas City Star.

 
Obama is ""more to the left of the announced Socialist in the United States Senate, Bernie Sanders of Vermont,"" McCain said when asked if he really thought Obama was ""an extremist.""
 
In truth, this is a recycled charge, one that

PolitiFact examined before.

But since the charge lives, we'll take it on again.
 
McCain's source is a vote rankings study put out each year by

National Journal,

a respected, nonpartisan, inside-the-beltway weekly magazine.
 
In January 2008, after analyzing 99 of the 442 votes taken by the Senate in 2007,

National Journal

reported that Obama was the most liberal of the bunch. Sanders finished fourth. The two differed on just three of the 99 votes the magazine studied.
 
According to

National Journal,

the three votes occurred in January, March and June of 2007. In January, Sanders joined a conservative majority in voting against establishing a Senate Office of Public Integrity to handle ethics complaints against senators. Obama voted for it.
 
Likewise, Sanders was with a conservative majority in June when he voted against moving forward with a comprehensive immigration reform bill. Again, Obama voted for it.
 
But in March, it was Obama siding with a conservative majority in voting for a resolution stating that funds for U.S. troops in the field should not be cut off. Sanders voted with liberals against the resolution.
 
So, as far as that one study goes, Obama was more liberal than Sanders in 2007 by a net difference of one vote. But the magazine's tally is inherently subjective, since it relies on the judgment of its editors and reporters to determine which votes show an ideological distinction.
 
And the sample size of votes comparing Obama to Sanders is quite small. Sanders only joined the Senate in 2007, Obama in 2005. And Obama wasn't the most liberal senator in either of his first two years, finishing 16th-most liberal in 2005, according to

National Journal,

and 10th-most liberal in 2006.
 
And as PolitiFact found earlier this year, other tallies disagree with

National Journal's

findings. Voteview.com, which conducts a similar study based on the judgments of political scientists, found that eight current senators, including Vermont's Sanders, were more liberal than Obama. The Voteview.com study looked at the breadth of the senators' careers, not just the most recent year.
 
Likewise, Americans for Democratic Action, a self-described liberal group, found that Obama needs to get a lot more liberal to match up with Sanders. In tallying votes it believed showed a liberal position, the group reported in February that Obama scored only a 75 percent liberal quotient in 2007, while Sanders clocked in at 95 percent. Obama might have scored as well as Sanders if he hadn't missed five of the 20 votes the ADA scored. Missed votes are counted against senators in the study. Sanders, by contrast, voted with the ADA on 19 of the 20 votes the group tallied.
 
Another method of evaluating senators' politics is used by

Congressional Quarterly,

which gauges how often they vote with members of their own party on bills that divide most Republicans from most Democrats. In that tally, both Obama and Sanders sided with the Democrats on 97 percent of partisan votes in 2007.
 
Even Charles Green,

National Journal's

editor, says he'd be wary of putting too much stock in any one rating methodology. ""There's pluses and minuses to each rating system. If you look at a number of them, I think you have a pretty good picture,"" he told PolitiFact in June.
 
So while McCain can make a case that Obama was more liberal than Sanders in 2007, that conclusion is more a matter of opinion than fact. As a result, we find his statement Barely True.

"['National', 'Military', 'John McCain']","
Damned if you don't
","In an effort to shore up his foreign policy chops, Sen. Barack Obama took the unusual step of making a trip overseas — to the Middle East and Europe. The idea, in part, was to show the presidential candidate's gravitas as an international leader.
 
But the strategy backfired a bit when Obama canceled plans to visit wounded troops at a military hospital in Germany.
 
Obama had been part of a congressional delegation that visited Iraq and Afghanistan, but when that trip ended Obama stayed on the road, spending several days on a campaign-funded tour of Europe. Landstuhl Regional Medical Center in Landstuhl, Germany, was supposed to be one of the stops.
 
The decision to cancel was made after the Pentagon raised a number of issues about its policy against campaign activity at a military base — including visits by campaign staff or any media coverage or speeches. As a sitting senator, Obama was welcome to visit troops, but no one on the campaign trip with him, including a retired general who is advising his campaign, could go along.
 
Obama found himself in an awkward spot: visit wounded troops alone and risk being seen as having used them as campaign props, or skip the wounded troops altogether. It was a no-win pickle of Obama's own making. He hoped to minimize the political controversy by backing out of the hospital visit.
 
The McCain campaign quickly pounced.
 
An ad released on July 26, 2008, implied Obama blew off the visit with wounded troops because he wasn't allowed to use it as a photo op.
 
""He made time to go to the gym, but canceled a visit with wounded troops,"" an annoucer says. ""Seems the Pentagon wouldn't allow him to bring cameras.""
 
That Obama visited a Berlin gym is not in dispute (though the McCain ad actually shows footage of Obama playing basketball with American troops at an airbase in Kuwait). Nor is it disputed that Obama canceled a scheduled visit with wounded troops.
 
But the ad suggests Obama canceled the visit because he wasn't allowed to bring cameras. That's the part the Obama campaign vehemently denies.
 
The Pentagon did raise questions about whether Obama's visit would amount to political activity, which is restricted at military installations.
 
""Nobody denied Sen. Obama the opportunity to visit our wounded being cared for at Landstuhl. Obviously as a sitting senator he has an interest in that and can certainly visit in an official capacity,"" said Bryan Whitman, spokesman for the Pentagon. ""There are, as you know though, restrictions on what you can do as a candidate for political office, that stems from trying to maintain political neutrality and not have the military involved in politics.""
 
""Under no circumstances may a candidate make a campaign-related statement on an instillation,"" Whitman said.
 
According to Department of Defense policy, ""Any activity that may be reasonably viewed as directly or indirectly associating the Department of Defense ... with a partisan political activity ... shall be avoided.""
Said Whitman: ""The senator's staff was informed of the limits on what the military can do with respect to a political campaign and how we could support a senator's visit to Landstuhl, and quite frankly I expected them to have the visit.""
 
The Obama campaign apparently thought better of it.
 
""Sen. Obama did not want to have a trip to see our wounded warriors perceived as a campaign event when his visit was to show his appreciation for our troops and decided instead not to go,'' retired Maj. Gen. Scott Gration, a foreign policy adviser to Obama, stated in a release from the campaign.
 
In addition to the ad, McCain took a swipe at Obama's decision during an appearance on the ABC News program

This Week

.
 
""Well, I know this, that those troops would have loved to have seen him,"" McCain said. ""And I know of no Pentagon regulation that would have prevented him from going there — without the media and the press and all of the associated people.""
 
""The important thing is that, if I had been told by the Pentagon that I couldn't visit those troops, and I was there and wanted to be there, I guarantee you, there would have been a seismic event.""
 
""I believe he had the opportunity to go without the media. And I'll let the facts speak for themselves.""
 
Obama campaign spokeswoman Linda Douglass told ABC News that Obama never intended for the visit to be a public event.
 
""We told military officials explicitly that Sen. Obama had absolutely no intention of bringing any members of the media or photographers in with him to visit the wounded warriors,"" Douglass said. ""In all of our communications with the military, we stressed that this was to be a private visit by Sen. Obama.""
 
In the past, Obama has met privately with wounded veterans at Walter Reed Army Medical Center. U.S. Sen. Jack Reed, D-R.I., who accompanied Obama on part of his tour, said Obama met privately with troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.
 
Sen. Chuck Hagel, R-Neb., also accompanied Obama as part of a congressional delegation on the official trip to Afghanistan and Iraq, but broke off when Obama parted with the delegation and embarked on a short European tour.
 
""At that point, it was a political trip for Sen. Obama,"" Hagel said on CBS's

Face the Nation.

""I think it would have been inappropriate for him and certainly he would have been criticized by the McCain people and the press and probably should have been if on a political trip in Europe paid for by political funds — not the taxpayers — to go, essentially, then and be accused of using our wounded men and women as props for his campaign. ... I think it would be totally inappropriate for him on a campaign trip to go to a military hospital and use those soldiers as props. So I think he probably, based on what I know, he did the right thing.""
 
Hagel added that he did not think the McCain ad was appropriate.
 
Here's what Obama said about it all:
 
""The staff was working this so I don't know each and every detail but here is what I understand happened,"" Obama told ABC News. ""We had scheduled to go, we had no problem at all in leaving, we always leave press and staff off — that is why we left it off the schedule. We were treating it in the same way we treat a visit to Walter Reed which I was able to do a few weeks ago without any fanfare whatsoever. I was going to be accompanied by one of my advisors, a former military officer (Gration).
 
""And we got notice that he would be treated as a campaign person, and it would therefore be perceived as political because he had endorsed my candidacy but he wasn't on the Senate staff. That triggered then a concern that maybe our visit was going to be perceived as political. And the last thing that I want to do is have injured soldiers and the staff at these wonderful institutions having to sort through whether this is political or not or get caught in the crossfire between campaigns.
 
""So rather than go forward and potentially get caught up in what might have been considered a political controversy of some sort,"" Obama said, ""what we decided was that we not make a visit and instead I would call some of the troops that were there. So that essentially would be the extent of the story.""
 
In a briefing with reporters, Robert Gibbs, a senior communications adviser to the Obama campaign, said the trip had been planned weeks in advance, but the campaign believed ""it could be done in a way that would not ... be ... seen as a campaign stop.""
 
Gibbs said the plan was to leave the media entourage on the plane while Obama made his visit.
 
MSNBC reporter Andrea Mitchell, who was part of the traveling press corps, confirmed that in an on-air interview with Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C.
 
""The point is that Obama had no intention of bringing any cameras with him,"" Mitchell said. ""I was there. I can vouch for that.""
 
So where are we? The Obama campaign explanation seems plausible. There is no hard evidence from the McCain campaign that the loss of a photo op played any role in Obama's decision. There's ample evidence, though no documentation, that Obama never intended to bring press to the hospital.
 
On the other hand, this is a problem of Obama's own creation. The fact remains he canceled the visit after the Pentagon voiced concern about political overtones. The fact remains, too, that Obama could have done a private visit even after the Pentagon raised its objections. Obama had done such visits before.
 
We can't give McCain's campaign any points for accuracy here, but neither can we say Obama is a helpless victim of a baseless attack. To do that we would have to give Obama and his version of the campaign's plans every benefit of the doubt. That leads us to Barely True.

Event was delayed as group talked to troops
","Just after Sen. Barack Obama visited Afghanistan during his recent trip abroad, a scathing e-mail from a captain at Bagram Air Base spread virus-style, infecting blogs and inboxes across the country.
 
""As you know I am not a very political person,"" the attack begins. ""I just wanted to pass along that Senator Obama came to Bagram Afghanistan for about an hour on his visit to 'The War Zone'. I wanted to share with you what happened.""
 
What happened, according to the author — who is

reportedly

a Utah Army National Guard intelligence officer — is that Obama went straight from his plane to a bulletproof vehicle, then to a meeting with a general, ignoring a line of soldiers waiting to shake his hand.
 
Afterward, Obama went to the Clamshell, a recreation tent, so photographers could take pictures of him playing basketball, the e-mail says. ""He again shunned the opportunity to talk to Soldiers to thank them for their service,"" the author wrote.
 
""I just don't understand how anyone would want him to be our Commander-and-Chief,"" the self-described apolitical officer says. ""It was almost that he was scared to be around those that provide the freedom for him and our great country.""
 
For good measure, he adds: ""What you see in the news is all fake."" (

What about what you see in your inbox?
 
We've

examined chain e-mails in depth

, and found a great many contain falsehoods. This is unexceptional in that regard.
 
Obama and the two senators with him did not brush off the troops, said Capt. Christian Patterson, a spokesman for the Army's Combined Joint Task Force-101 (CJTF, in Pentagon speak) at Bagram Air Field.
 
""There were three members of the congressional delegation and they did stop and take time to shake hands with service members here,"" Patterson said.
 
In fact, briefings ""were delayed as the senators took time to shake hands, speak to troops, and pose for photographs,"" said a

press release

issued by the Army.
 
And that bit about blowing off the troops for photo ops on the basketball court?
""Sen. Obama did not go to the 'Clamshell' recreational tent or play basketball during his stop here,"" the press release says. (Obama played basketball with troops at a prior stop in Kuwait.)
 
""His itinerary was set by CJTF-101 prior to the visit,"" the press release continues. ""While CJTF-101 cannot say if this blog is authentic, the comments in it are inappropriate and factually incorrect.""
 
We were unable to speak directly with the e-mail's author, identified in most versions of the e-mail and in published accounts as Capt. Jeffrey S. Porter of the 142nd Military Intelligence Battalion. Patterson said military policy prohibited him from saying whether or not a Jeffrey Porter was serving at Bagram.
 
The

Army Times

reported that it corresponded with Porter, who asked them to ""delete my e-mail and not forward it [because] after checking my sources some of the information that was put out in my e-mail was wrong. This e-mail was meant only for my family."" The
New York Daily News

reported a similar exchange

but did not identify the e-mail author by name.
 
But because the military directly and unequivocally contradicted the most damaging allegations at issue — that Obama shunned troops on various occasions, including on his way to a photo opportunity on the basketball court — we rule this claim False.

"['Environment', 'National', 'John McCain']","
Disaster, no. Difficulties, yes.
","At a town hall meeting in Albuquerque, N.M., John McCain promoted the idea of expanding offshore drilling, and downplayed the potential for environmental problems.
 
""Sen. Obama opposes offshore drilling,"" McCain said on July 15, 2008. ""I think if the states want to drill off their coasts, we should do it and do it immediately. And by the way, the governor of Florida has said he thinks it's a good idea. In California, Gov. Schwarzenegger thinks it's not a good idea. I would remind you that off the coast of Louisiana and Texas, they both had hurricanes that did not cause any real difficulties. So the environmental side of it I think is pretty well okay. But we need to do that. ""
 
McCain is referring here to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, which hit the coasts of Louisiana and Texas within weeks of each other in 2005.
 
Consider the worst-case scenario of years ago: a drilling rig becomes unplugged and spews an unending supply of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. Back in June 1979, the Mexican drilling rig IXTOC I malfunctioned off the coast of Mexico and spilled about 140-million gallons into the Gulf before technicians were able to cap it 10 months later. To prevent that sort of disaster, rigs now have safety valves under the ocean floor that prevent spills even if the rig is damaged. Those valves worked as they were supposed to during Katrina and Rita.
 
But it's a stretch to say the storms caused ""no real difficulties.""
 
Without question, oil spills did occur offshore in the wake of Katrina and Rita. Studies commissioned by the Minerals Management Service, a division of the U.S. Interior Department, concluded that a total of just over 741,000 gallons of oil spilled due to Hurricanes Katrina and Rita on the outercontinental shelf, the technical term for the area offshore.
 
""We have not said that there were no spills,"" said David Smith, deputy chief of public affairs for MMS. ""We've said that there are no reports of oil from federal waters reaching shore or causing environmental damage.""
 
Another MMS study looked at offshore oil platforms. It noted that the hurricanes crossed the path of about 3,000 offshore platforms, destroying 117 platforms that either became unmoored or fell into the sea.
 
""They were either completely toppled to the seafloor with no structure visible above the waterline, or were so severely damaged that it was obvious the structure was destroyed by the hurricanes and could no longer carry out its purpose and had to be removed,"" according to an MMS report. (You can view prestorm photos of the destroyed platforms via

this report

.)
 
Nevertheless, according to the MMS report authored by Energo Engineering of Houston, ""There was no life loss and no significant pollution, which is a tribute to the Minerals Management Service oversight of offshore operations and American Petroleum Institute design codes … for the structural design of fixed offshore platforms.""
 
Some of the oil spilled likely came from the pipelines that bring oil from the platforms to shore. When rigs are blown over in the storms, the collapse can damage the pipes, and that's likely what caused most of the offshore spills.
 
A McCain spokesman said McCain was referring to problems associated with offshore platforms, and that the amount of oil spilled from them was minimal. ""Senator McCain is exactly right, offshore oil facilities in the Gulf of Mexico stood up astoundingly well to the hurricanes,"" said spokesman Taylor Griffin.
 
Keep in mind, however, that Louisiana's oil business isn't strictly offshore. Oil is piped from rigs in the Gulf to the mainland of Louisiana, where it is stored and processed throughout the area.
 
""Offshore, there were relatively few spills,"" said Roland Guidry, head of the Louisiana Oil Spill Coordinator's Office. ""Inland, we have a lot of exposed pipelines and tank batteries along the shore. Those are the things that gave us trouble.""
 
Mostly onshore sources created oil spills that came to 8.2-million gallons, and possibly reached as high as 9- to 10-million gallons, Guidry said. That includes spills from platforms, pipelines, tankers, oil refineries and storage facilities.
 
The upper end of that estimate would place the gallons spilled near the same scale as the 1989

Exxon Valdez

spill, one of the worst environmental disasters in U.S. history. The important difference here is that the Valdez spill — at close to 11-million gallons — was highly concentrated, while the Katrina and Rita spills were from numerous sources and spread widely.
 
One of worst spills occurred at a refinery in Meraux, La., operated by Murphy Oil USA Inc., which before the storm handled about 630,000 gallons of oil a day. As Hurricane Katrina roared ashore, it breached an above-ground oil storage tank that disgorged more than a million gallons of oil into a residential area, tainting about 3,500 homes and businesses. As the result of a federal lawsuit, Murphy Oil agreed to a settlement that totaled $330-million.
 
A 2006 report from the U.S. Coast Guard detailed six major oil spills, including the Murphy Oil spill, five medium spills, and approximately 5,000 minor spills that occurred in the wake of the storms.
 
Environmental groups agree that the worst damage occurred away from the offshore drilling platforms, but say it's silly to think that the two things are unrelated.
 
""You can't have offshore development without the onshore facilities to support it,"" said Athan Manuel, a spokesman with the Sierra Club.
 
McCain's statement about drilling not ""causing any real difficulties"" is cautiously phrased in comparison to remarks from some other political figures.
 
Trent Lott, the former senator from Mississippi and a McCain supporter, said on MSNBC on July 15, 2008: ""We didn't have one drop of oil spilt when we had the biggest hurricane in recent history, Hurricane Katrina."" That statement is demonstrably false.
 
""The government data itself shows that there were spills,"" said Manuel. ""We're disappointed that that argument has taken root.""
 
The divide here seems stark: Oil drilling proponents view the damage as minimal, an acceptable part of doing business. They say safety precautions the oil industry put in place worked. Opponents of drilling, on the other hand, see the amount of oil spilled onshore and near shore as cause for concern, and are angered by attempts to minimize the real damage that did happen.
 
If McCain's point is that no individual well spewed large amounts of oil into the Gulf as a result of Katrina and Rita, he's correct.
 
But his comments at the town hall meeting were more vague. Talking about oil drilling and saying the storms ""did not cause any real difficulties"" seems like putting a happy face on a situation where damage did occur as a result of the oil and gas industry that permeates south Louisiana.
 
If McCain had been more specific about rigs versus oil development as a whole, we might be inclined to give him a better rating. But in this case, we give his statement Half True.

"['National', 'Economy', 'Barack Obama']","
He probably should have some doubt
","In a conversation with reporters en route from Chicago to California recently, Sen. Barack Obama expressed a bleak outlook on the nation's economy.
 
""I have little doubt that we've moved into recession at this point,"" he said July 12, 2008.
 
Aides said it was his most definitive judgment to date on the state of the economy. He made the point to support his call for a new economic stimulus package.
 
""The sooner we can get money into people's pockets, the sooner that we can stabilize the housing market,"" he continued. ""And the sooner that we can send a message to the markets that we're serious about creating an energy policy that will create greater energy efficiency over the next decade or so, I think the sooner we're going to get our fundamentals right.""
 
Prescriptions aside, we wondered whether his premise — that the nation is in a recession — was correct.
 
There's ample reason to be concerned about the economy: home prices are down, automobile sales have slowed, unemployment is up, gas prices are sky-high, food prices are rising, and so on.
 
But none of that necessarily means we're in a recession.
 
By widespread consensus, the arbiter of whether this country is in a recession is the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private, nonprofit research organization based in Cambridge, Mass. What persuaded us of the bureau's status as the official recession referee was that countless economists said — both in interviews with us and in articles like

this

,

this

and

this

— that the profession as a whole defers to the bureau on the matter.
 
And the bureau has not said we are in a recession. That's not to say we're not — typically, the declaration comes six to 18 months after the recession hits.
 
""We have not said we're in a recession now, but that doesn't mean we're not in one because we always tell you after the fact,"" said Donna Zerwitz, spokesperson for the bureau.
 
There's a widespread misconception, even among some economists, that the bureau defines recessions as two or more consecutive periods of decline in the country's gross domestic product. If that were the case, Obama would be wrong, because the GDP actually

increased slightly

in the first quarter of 2008.
 
But recessions are not always marked by two or more consecutive periods of negative GDP growth, the bureau says.
 
""Most of the recessions identified by our procedures do consist of two or more quarters of declining real GDP, but not all of them,"" the bureau

explains

on its Web site. ""Our procedure differs from the two-quarter rule in a number of ways.""
 
Recessions are declared by the bureau's Business Cycle Dating Committee, which is made up of seven volunteer economists. They consider the depth as well as the duration of the decline in economic activity. And they use a constellation of indicators, not just GDP.
 
Here's how the group defines a recession, as pulled from its Web site: ""A recession is a significant decline in economic activity spread across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales.""
 
Bottom line: ""It's unknowable at this point whether what we're going through is a recession,"" said Chad Stone, chief economist at the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington, D.C. ""My opinion is that the formal definition of whether we're in a recession or not is less important than the fact that we have had a significant economic downturn.""
 
Still, Obama didn't say ""downturn,"" he said ""recession,"" a loaded term that can trigger an emotional reaction in an audience and, if it's uttered by the right person, a jittery response by stockholders and consumers. So we're holding him to it.
 
Neither Obama's economic adviser Austan Goolsbee nor his spokesman Tommy Vietor returned calls to explain why Obama said what he did.
 
Because the National Bureau of Economic Research has not ruled on the matter, we can't say for sure that Obama was wrong. But he implied that there is little doubt that we're in a recession, when in fact there is ample room for doubt. Remember, recessions typically include negative growth, and GDP actually rose slightly in the first quarter of this year.
 
Obama may well have little doubt that we're in a recession. But it's difficult to conceive that his economic advisers, who surely have a handle on the technical nuances at work, had not informed him that there's room for plenty of doubt about that. So we rule his statement Barely True.
