Mark Warner says average holding time for stocks has fallen to four months
","U.S. Sen. Mark Warner joined the ranks of Wall Street critics during a recent radio interview, by complaining that investors increasingly are focused on reaping quick profits from companies at the expense of long-term value. ""The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the ’60s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months,"" he said during an interview on ""Cat’s Roundtable,"" a New York City radio talk show hosted by John Catsimatidis, a billionaire businessman. We wondered whether Warner, D-Va., is right about the plunge in share-holding time. Warner’s office sent us a variety of articles by academics, investment strategists, newspapers and magazines that contained similar statistics to the ones cited by the senator. The source of the historic data is the New York Stock Exchange which, for most of the 20th century, was the dominant U.S. stock-trading venue. Here’s the NYSE’s average holding period for stocks at the start of each new decade, beginning at Warner’s mark in 1960: •1960, eight years, four months; •1970, five years, three months; •1980, two years, nine months; •1990, two years, two months; and •2000, one year, two months. But many new trading venues have opened and expanded in recent decades - E*Trade and NASDAQ, for example - and the New York Stock Exchange’s dominance has diminished. About 25 percent of all U.S. trading now occurs on the NYSE, which has high financial requirements for the companies it lists and generally deals with large, stable stocks. In 2004, the NYSE changed its formula for calculating average share-holding periods to focus on its own listings. Credit Suisse that year began computing share-holding data that reflect the broader U.S. stock market. Credit Suisse figures show that in 2008 and 2009, when the nation was mired in the Great Recession, shares turned over an average almost five times a year. That’s slowed to about three times a year since 2013 or, as Warner put it, once every four months. The World Bank offers more conservative figures, saying U.S. shares, on average, turned over four times a year during the Great Recession and that slowed to 1.65 times a year in 2015 - or about once every eight months. Stock market analysts and academics note a variety of reasons for the quickening turnover of shares. Many say the days of small ma-and-pa investors have given way to an era of mutual funds and hedge funds that exert strong pressure of companies to produce short-term profits. The growth of e-trading also is cited; so are federal laws passed in 1993 that tied the bonuses of executives to their achievement of measurable performance goals in order for the bonuses to be tax-deductible for their companies. Warner said the consequence of ""activist investors"" is that corporations pay less attention to training workers and to research and development. He said Congress should explore offering tax incentives to companies that embrace those long-range goals. Many activist investors, to the contrary, say their actions have been beneficial and note that the stock market has continued to rise over the decades. Our ruling Warner said, ""The average time someone used to hold a share of stock back in the ’60s was eight years. Now, the average time is four months.""   The gist of Warner’s statement is undeniable: The average holding period for stocks has eroded greatly during the past 56 years. The specifics of Warner’s statement, however, need a little elaboration. Estimates by Credit Suisse jibe with Warner’s claim that shares, on average, now are held for four months. The World Bank estimates the holding period now is about eight months. So we rate Warner’s statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2016/jul/06/mark-warner/mark-warner-says-average-holding-time-stocks-has-f/

Barack Obama wrong about size of U.S. steel production, work force
","When Donald Trump made a high-profile speech outlining his approach to trade, he did it in Monessen, Pa., a town near Pittsburgh where a big steel mill has been shuttered for the past three decades. A day after Trump’s speech, Barack Obama brought up the history of American steel during a joint appearance with the Canadian prime minister and the Mexican president, who were meeting for a summit in Ottawa. Reporters asked the three leaders what they would do to counter the anti-free-trade sentiment exemplified by Trump. Obama acknowledged the shortcomings of trade agreements, but he argued that reverting to tariffs and a possible trade war was the wrong way to improve the situation. He pointed to technological change as an irreversible factor. ""This nostalgia about an era when everybody was working in manufacturing jobs, and you didn’t need a college degree, and you could go in and as long as you worked hard you could support a family and live a middle-class life -- that has been undermined far more by automation than it has been by outsourcing or the shift of jobs to ... low-wage countries,"" Obama said. ""I mean, the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just (that) it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to."" Several readers asked us to look into Obama’s comparison -- that ""the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to."" It turns out that Obama was wrong on both counts. Steel production Frank Giarratani, an economist at the University of Pittsburgh who specializes in the steel industry, provided us with numbers calculated by the U.S. Geological Survey for raw steel production. The data goes back to 1900. The high point came in 1973, when the United States produced 137 million metric tons of raw steel. By 2013, the most recent year available, that had fallen to 87 million metric tons -- a decline of more than one-third from 1973. That’s not even close to ""as much"" as the peak, which is what Obama said. ""We do produce a lot of steel, but current production is far below the post-WWII peak,"" Giarratani said. Raw steel production is also down a bit since 2008, when the figure was 92 million metric tons. That was the last year before Obama took office and, perhaps more important, the last year before the Great Recession really hit. Production plunged in 2009, before eventually rebounding. Other current economic trends have also had an impact. For instance, the ongoing decline in oil and gas drilling due to low prices is driving companies to cut back on tubing orders, contributing to a slowdown in steel production, said Jeff Manuel, an associate professor of historical studies at Southern Illinois University-Edwardsville. ""I live near U.S. Steel’s Granite City Works in Granite City, Ill.,"" Manuel said. ""This mill is currently shut down due, as I understand it, largely to slack demand from oil and gas companies in the Gulf Coast region."" Steel industry employment Tracking employment is a little trickier than tracking production, but several experts said that the one-tenth figure Obama cited is off base. Data from the American Iron and Steel Institute pegged the all-time employment high at 650,000 employees in 1953. More recent data from the institute, for 2015, shows that the steel industry directly employs about 142,000 people in the United States. That’s closer to one in five jobs left, not the one in 10 Obama cited. ""So one-tenth is an exaggeration,"" said Benjamin H. Liebman, an economist at Saint Joseph's University who specializes in international trade. The automation trend Obama mentioned did contribute to the downsizing. ""The major reason that steel employment has fallen drastically over the last 40 years is improved technology,"" Liebman said. According to the American Iron and Steel Institute, ""labor productivity has seen a fivefold increase since the early 1980s, going from an average of 10.1 man-hours per finished ton to an average of 1.9 man-hours per finished ton of steel in 2014."" American steel production has increasingly shifted away from the extraction of ore for raw material and towards the recycling of scrap metal, which typically requires fewer workers. ""Now, more than 50 percent of all steel produced in the United States is from a process that recycles scrap metal,"" Giarratani said. The White House acknowledged that Obama’s remark was incorrect, and instead told PolitiFact that ""the U.S. is producing considerably more steel than when the president took office."" However, the statistics the White House used to back up that assertion were based on 2009 data, which captured the post-recession low point. Our ruling Obama said that ""the steel industry is producing as much steel in the United States as it ever was. It’s just it needs one-tenth of the workers that it used to."" In reality, production is down by more than one-third from its historical peak in 1973, and the employment picture -- while still severely shrunken -- is down to about one-fifth of its 1950s level, rather than one-tenth. We rate the claim False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2a7d3cfd-4d6c-40a7-80b3-df2e6c563bb8",/factchecks/2016/jul/05/barack-obama/barack-obama-wrong-about-size-us-steel-production-/

Group says Colorado Senate candidate voted to take 'taxpayer-funded junket' to China. She never went
","For the second straight election, a conservative group has attacked a Democratic Colorado state Senate candidate with the same claim: ""Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer-funded junket to China."" In late June, political mailers started arriving at homes in the northwest Denver suburbs of Senate District 19. They featured a photoshopped image of a smiling Zenzinger wearing sunglasses with dollar signs on the lenses and an ornamental Asian bridge in the background. ""While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China,"" the mailer said. The back of the mailer showed a pagoda and elaborated on the claim, saying, ""Zenzinger couldn’t be trusted with taxpayer money on the city council -- we definitely can’t trust her to oversee $26 billion in the State Senate."" The mailers were produced by Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government, a  conservative 527 political group. 527s are tax-exempt entities (organized under section 527 of the Internal Revenue Code) that can collect unlimited donations and influence a political issue, policy, appointment or election. But to maintain nonprofit status, the groups cannot expressly advocate that people vote for or against a candidate. The same group attacked Zenzinger for a taxpayer-backed junket to China in 2014. But just as before, there are key problems with these attacks. ""I’ve never been to China,"" Zenzinger told PolitiFact. ""I was joking to friends, believe me if I had been to China, I would have had so many pictures on Facebook they wouldn't have to Photoshop my picture in the ads."" Also, while on the Arvada City Council in 2013, Zenzinger made -- and then voted for -- a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for a proposed sister-city delegation to China. No city officials ever went on the trip. But you wouldn’t know that from this mailer, or a 2014 TV ad called ""China Girl"" that targeted Zenzinger, who was running to hang onto her Senate seat.  Zenzinger had been appointed in 2013 to the District 19 seat to replace Democratic Sen. Evie Hudak, who resigned in the face of a recall effort by gun-rights groups angered by gun-control laws passed by Democratic lawmakers after the deadly mass shooting at an Aurora movie theater in 2012. Zenzinger lost the election by 663 votes to Republican candidate Laura Woods — a defeat she blames on the misleading TV ad and mailers with the same misleading theme. Now Zenzinger is running in a rematch against Woods. ""I would knock on people's doors and they'd be like, 'Oh yeah, you went to China,’ "" she said. So if there was no trip, what is the mailer talking about? A 2013 council meeting As evidence, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government emailed PolitiFact a brief excerpt from the minutes of an Arvada City Council meeting on April 1, 2013. Council members were discussing an invitation from the mayor of Arvada’s sister city, Jinzhou, China, to send an official delegation from Arvada to the 2013 World Landscape Art Exposition. A nonprofit group, Arvada Sister Cities International, recommended that the invitation be accepted and that an official delegation -- including Arvada city officials, members of the local Chinese Chamber of Commerce and Arvada Sister Cities -- attend the Jinzhou expo.  Councilman Bob Dyer made a motion to accept the group’s recommendation and send a delegation to Jinzhou, according to the meeting minutes. Before the vote on the motion, the 527 group points out, Mayor Marc Williams said he was uncomfortable using public funds on the trip. The mayor said ""since he understands the motion includes sending delegation members from the city at city expense, he cannot support it,"" according to the minutes. However, he said he would back sending Zenzinger as the elected representative if her travel was privately funded. Zenzinger voted for the Dyer motion to send a delegation, but it failed, 4-3. But that wasn’t the end of the meeting. The group attacking Zenzinger left out what happened next. Zenzinger then made her own motion, saying if a city delegation was sent, the money would come from a non-city source.   ""Councilmember Cook asked if Ms. Zenzinger is suggesting that no city costs be used in the delegation and Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger said yes,"" the minutes state. ""Mayor Pro Tem Zenzinger clarified...that if Sister Cities is unable to fund them, then we would come back and decline the invitation."" Zenzinger’s motion passed on a 5-2 vote. Ultimately, no city officials or employees went to China because no private funding was found. ‘Outrageous fabrications’ Several people who were at the council meeting on the China delegation proposal blasted the attacks on Zenzinger. City Councilman Mark McGoff called the current mailers and the 2014 TV ad ""outrageous fabrications."" ""I'm appalled by that because it besmirches Rachel Zenzinger's reputation and it's made out of whole cloth. There's just nothing there. She didn't vote to send herself on a junket and she didn't go on a junket,"" McGoff said. Just because Zenzinger voted to send a delegation doesn't mean she ""intended to use city funds,"" said Edna Gordon, president of Arvada Sister Cities. Participants paid their own way on previous sister city trips, including a 2008 delegation when two councilmembers and the city manager went to Jinzhou (before Zenzinger was on the council), Gordon said. Even the local Arvada Sister Cities group’s members paid for their trips. Williams, the mayor, has a different view of Zenzinger’s initial vote in favor of Dyer’s motion to ""send a delegation to Jinzhou."" ""Did she support a motion that would have funded through city funds the opportunity for her to go? Yes, she did,"" the mayor said. But he stressed that she also made the subsequent successful motion ""with the explicit direction that no city funds be used."" ""My negativity toward their ad is that it implies that she actually took that trip, and she didn’t,"" Williams said. Zenzinger disagrees with the mayor’s interpretation. ""Yes, I voted to approve an ‘official’ delegation, which meant that an elected official would make the trip,"" Zenzinger said in an email. ""The funding for the delegation was not addressed until the subsequent vote."" ""Mayor Williams’ comments about funding, even though they were not relevant to the original motion, prompted me to make a second motion that clarified and distinguished that this delegation would receive no funding from the city,"" Zenzinger added. Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government did not respond to additional requests for comment from PolitiFact. Our ruling In a political mailer, Colorado Citizens for Accountable Government stated, ""While serving in the city council, Rachel Zenzinger voted to use tax dollars to take a taxpayer funded junket to China."" As of a member of the Arvada City Council, Zenzinger did vote on a failed motion to send an official delegation to a sister-city event in China. This hardly supports the political group’s accusation. Not only did Zenzinger initiate a successful motion explicitly prohibiting use of taxpayer funds for the delegation to China. She never even went to China! The attack is a gross distortion of the facts.

At 'Three Amigos' summit, Obama overshoots trade benefits between Mexico, Canada
","President Barack Obama joined Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau and Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto June 30, 2016, to celebrate their countries’ partnerships. The ""Three Amigos"" press conference — part of the North American Leaders Summit in Ottawa — saw the three leaders addressing issues of globalization. All claimed better relationships with their neighbors, and Obama in particular said the United States thrives as a result. ""During my administration, for example, we boosted U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico by about 50 percent,"" he said. ""That supports about 2.8 million American jobs."" The statement resonates this election as free trade policies have been front and center. Both Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders have attacked Hillary Clinton on her trade record, claiming it cost domestic jobs. Yet Obama suggests exports have supported, not destroyed, jobs. So we took a closer look at whether his claims hold up. On the rise We looked to the Bureau of Economic Analysis to verify the number. The White House told us they started from 2009, the first year of Obama’s term, as they do for all measures of economic change. So to calculate the percentage change, we first need to identify the total amount of exports, both goods and services. We calculated a 51 percent increase between 2009 and 2015. As for trade with Mexico, there was a 76 percent spike. Canada saw a 36 percent increase. The White House used quarterly data, which yields a 57 percent increase. We used annual data upon advice of multiple experts. A year makes all the difference So the baseline numbers support Obama’s assertion about the rise in exports. But experts say the specific timeframe Obama used, ""during my administration,"" is misleading. Obama took office in 2009 at the height of a global economic recession. As such, exports to all countries were depressed. In this case, that is actually good for Obama. If exports were so low in 2009, it’d be easier to claim rapid growth when the larger trend might not be as eye-catching, said Mark Perry, a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. Several experts told us 2008 — the year prior to Obama taking office — serves as a better baseline year and the economic standard for measuring accomplishments ""during"" a president’s administration. Using the same methodology as before, but starting from 2008, Canadian exports increased by 10 percent and Mexican exports by 50 percent.   That translates to a 25 percent increase in total exports — not 50 percent. Ambiguous claims Obama also claimed the United States job market has been bolstered by the export trade. His office cited a study from the International Trade Administration within the Commerce Department, which found that, in 2014, exports to Mexico supported 1.1 million jobs and Canada 1.7 million. Add that up and you get 2.8 million jobs, of course. But Obama’s specific comments don’t necessarily reflect what the study said. In Ottawa, Obama said that the rise in exports to Canada and Mexico supported 2.8 million jobs. But the Commerce Department figures reflect the total number of jobs supported by exports to our neighboring countries — not the number of jobs created by the increase. The report indicates an increase of 514,000 jobs between 2009 and 2014 stemming from exports to Mexico and Canada. The 2.8 million figure applies to the ""number of jobs in 2014"" supported by all exports to Mexico and Canada. Job displacing The statistic is also misleading as a picture of trade because it fails to consider ""job-displacing"" imports and the trade balance, said Robert Scott, a senior economist at the Economic Policy Institute. Total imports from Canada and Mexico to the United States have increased less than exports, percentage-wise, since 2008. As a result, Scott said, our total trade deficit with Canada and Mexico has declined. That’s good for job growth, he said, but not as good as Obama makes it out to be. Doing his own research, Scott estimated net job growth since 2008 by comparing the trade deficit to United States’ gross domestic product, and then looking at the historical relationships between GDP and employment. Point being, Scott used the trade deficit, not just exports, and found that at most 500,000 jobs could have been created by U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade since 2008. It is important to note the economists still debate the relationship between jobs and trade. More pro-free-trade economists argue imports actually boost American jobs because of increased economic demand. Some, like Gary Hufbauer at the Peterson Institute of International Economics, said two-way trade has little net effect on jobs. Cause and effect The last piece to this claim is whether the Obama administration is truly responsible for the increase in exports. Obama did launch the National Export Initiative in 2010 to promote export-conducive conditions in the private sector. His goal was to double exports from its $8.5 billion level in 2009, but the number has fallen far short, said Edward Alden, a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. Perry also noted exports to Canada and Mexico have fallen as of late, with Canadian exports below their 2008 peak levels. Obama’s accomplishments have had some effect on exports, but experts said there were larger influences at play. Gradual economic recovery in Canada and Mexico after the recession played a significant role, for example. Oil discoveries — both abroad and domestically — as well as currency exchange rates also helped boost American exports, Scott said. Exports of oil have increased from 858,000 in 2010 to 1.7 million in 2015 to all countries (not just Mexico and Canada), according to the Energy Information Administration. Agricultural products also make up a significant portion of exports to both Canada and Mexico — America's largest and third largest agricultural export market, respectively.  Our ruling Obama said, ""During my administration, for example, we boosted U.S. exports to Canada and Mexico by about 50 percent. That supports about 2.8 million American jobs."" The first claim is plausible, though experts say Obama should have used 2008, not 2009, as his baseline. That change would have cut the growth down to about 30 percent. The second claim is wrong, so long as you believe Obama to be suggesting that 2.8 million jobs were created due to export increases. We rate these claims Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/9c21f93f-09e9-4f15-8239-71781338bf0f",/factchecks/2016/jul/05/barack-obama/obama-incorrectly-characterizes-job-growth-due-inc/

As Warren says, Trump is no fan of post-crisis Wall Street regulations
","Sen. Elizabeth Warren did not leave her signature issue behind when she became presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump’s most pugnacious critic. ""Donald Trump has already offered his big wet kiss to Wall Street. He has said, ‘Hey guys, if I get in, I'm going to roll back all of those regulations, because it makes it too hard for banks to cheat people,’ "" Warren said in a June 28 interview on The View.                           Trump never said he wanted to make it easier for banks to cheat people, but he has said he wants to roll back regulations on Wall Street. In the context of the interview, Warren is likely referring to the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protect Act, the premier piece of legislation regulating the banking industry after the crash. Warren has been a consistent crusader for stricter regulation of the financial industry. Early in the campaign, Trump distinguished himself from his rivals for the Republican nomination with some tough language directed toward Wall Street. ""The hedge fund guys didn't build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky,"" Trump said in a CBS interview in August. At other points, he extended a similar critique to ""Wall Street Guys"" in general. Trump said that hedge fund managers ""get away with murder,"" but he’s been unclear about what he’d do to change that. One concrete Trump proposal on Wall Street was changes to the tax code that would change tax provisions benefitting hedge fund managers, but because of separate tax cuts for partnerships, his tax plan actually had the effect of substantially improving their position. On Dodd-Frank, Trump has gone on the record again and again saying that the law is bad news for the economy and the banking industry. He’s called it a ""disaster,"" and a ""very negative force."" Well before he launched his current presidential run, Trump attacked increased regulation after the financial crisis, which he said prevented loans to all but the very wealthy. And while it's not the same thing as a ""big wet kiss to Wall Street,"" Trump has said he expects bankers to appreciate his position. ""I think things have to be done with (Dodd-Frank), and I think Wall Street would like to hear that,"" Trump told Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo. The only bit of wiggle room here is that Trump has been inconsistent about how much of Dodd-Frank would be left when he finished with it. He has said he would ""get rid of it,"" ""repeal it"" or, almost word-for-word from Warren’s statement, ""roll that back."" He has also said, however, that ""there are some aspects you could leave,"" and that could be ""changed greatly"" instead of being eliminated. In Trump’s most recent statement about Dodd-Frank, in a mid May interview with Reuters, he said he would release a plan within two weeks that would be ""close to a dismantling of Dodd-Frank."" A month after his Reuters interview, the plan, which would presumably settle this question, has not been released. The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment for this story. Our ruling Warren said Trump wants to ""roll back all of those regulations"" on Wall Street banks. While we don’t know what Trump’s plan would look like exactly, he certainly wants to scrap a lot of the law. It might not be right to say ""all"" of those regulations, but Trump himself has been unclear on that point.

"['Education', 'Islam', 'Virginia', 'Pat Robertson']","
Pat Robertson misleadingly says Obama was schooled at 'Islamic madrassa'
","Pat Robertson says President Barack Obama won’t take Islamic nations to task for harboring terrorists, and the big reason dates to the president’s early school years. ""The truth is, we have a president, we have a president whose stepfather was a Muslim, whose stepfather, in Indonesia, put him in an Islamic madrassa,"" Robertson, a religious broadcaster based In Virginia Beach, said during the June 27 edition of his television show ""The 700 Club."" We checked on whether Obama really did attend an ""Islamic madrassa."" Let’s start with some basics. ""Madrassa"" means school in Arabic, but in English, the word has taken on additional connotations. Merriam Webster’s defines it as a ""Muslim school, college or university that is often part of a mosque."" The Congressional Research Service, in a 2008 report, defined a madrassa as an Islamic religious school. Revelations that some terrorists developed radical political beliefs at madrassas have led to accusations that the facilities ""promote Islamic extremism and militancy, and are a breeding ground for terrorism,"" the research service said. The report also notes that others believe madrassas ""have been blamed unfairly for fostering anti-U.S. sentiments."" Moments after saying Obama attended an ""Islamic madrassa,"" Robertson added: ""Now, Obama has visceral dislike for the standards that we have in this country. What he thinks is, America is an oppressor, and he thinks that the nation of Islam, the Islamic countries, at least should not be in any way called out for the actions that they have."" Rumors and charges about Obama’s early education have been circulating since he began running for president in 2007. Generally, they accuse Obama of attending a madrassa espousing a rigid form of Islam that’s hostile to the West. They refer to the president’s school days in Indonesia from 1967 to 1971, when he was ages 6 to 10. In his 2006 autobiography, ""The Audacity of Hope,"" Obama wrote that in Indonesia, he first attended a Catholic school and later went to a  ""predominantly Muslim school."" In an earlier 2004 autobiography, ""Dreams from My Father,"" Obama wrote that he spent two years at a Catholic school and two years at ""a Muslim school."" He described himself as a youngster who was not very interested in either religion. ""In the Muslim school, the teacher wrote to my mother that I made faces during Koranic studies,"" Obama wrote in 2004. ""My mother wasn’t overly concerned. ‘Be respectful,’ she’d said. In the Catholic school, when it came time to pray, I pretended to close my eyes then peek around the room. Nothing happened. No angels descended."" When the rumors arose about Obama’s Indonesian education, his campaign issued a news release saying he never was a Muslim and was raised in a secular household. Obama has said he became a Christian in his 20s while working as a community organizer in Chicago. Several news organizations sent reporters to the school in question and found it was a public school that didn’t promote one particular religion. ""This is a public school. We don't focus on religion,"" Hardi Priyono, deputy headmaster of the school, told CNN in a 2007 interview. ""In our daily lives, we try to respect religion, but we don't give preferential treatment."" The school provides some religious study. Priyono told the Chicago Tribune in 2007 that Muslim students learn about their religion, while Christians are taught about their faith. The article said that when Obama attended fourth grade in 1971, there was two hours of religious study a week. ""At holidays, the school made a practice of teaching students about different religions,"" the Tribune reported. ""Students from all religions celebrated Christmas with a Christmas tree and carols. They celebrated the Islamic holiday of Eid al-Adha by handing out a sacrificed goat to the neighborhood's needy."" A spokesman for the Indonesian Ministry of Religious Affairs told The Associated Press in 2007 that allegations Obama attended an Islamic school were baseless, saying the future president went to ""a public primary school that is open to people of all faiths."" We reached out to Robertson for evidence Obama attended an ""Islamic madrassa."" Chris Roslan, a spokesman for the Christian Broadcasting Network, told us Robertson would address our question on air. On the June 29 broadcast of ""The 700 Club,"" Robertson said he felt a need to clarify his statement. He walked back his previous comments but only up to a point. Robertson paraphrased from Obama’s autobiographical accounts of his time in Indonesia. ""He said he spent two years in a predominantly Muslim school in Indonesia where he studied Islam,"" Robertson said. ""So I want to correct that was not a - but in Arabic, a madrassa is a school. That’s what the term in Arabic is. You say ‘school,’ and it translates as ‘madrassa,’ but it’s become now a training ground of Islamic, and apparently, we’re not sure that the president attended one of them, so I want to correct that and let everybody this is precisely what he said - ‘I went to a predominantly Muslim school in Indonesia’ where he studied Islam,"" Robertson said. Co-host Wendy Griffith said, ""He studied Islam, but he says he’s a Christian."" ""Yeah, well sure,"" Robertson replied, raising his palms. Our ruling Robertson said Obama attended an ""Islamic madrassa."" The Congressional Research Service notes that madrassas are Islamic religious schools and in recent years sometimes have been defined as breeding grounds that promote Islamic extremism and terrorism. Robertson plays bait-and-switch with definitions. He says the president attended an ""Islamic madrassa"" while accusing him of being weak on terrorism, protective of Islamic nations, and viewing the U.S. as ""an oppressor.""  He dials it back when pressed for details, noting that madrassa, in Arabic, simply means ""school."" Robertson has a slight leg to stand on in that Obama, as a child in Indonesia, went to a public school where a majority of the students were Muslim. In a 2004 memoir, Obama described it as a ""Muslim school."" And the future president, as part of the curriculum, spent two hours a week in classes about Islam. But Robertson doesn’t tell his viewers the larger part of the story: The school was non-sectarian; it celebrated Christian and Islamic holidays; and that the school offered separate religion classes where Muslim and Christian students could learn about their faiths. So we rate Robertson’s misleading statement Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/604c3bd5-ce40-4a99-ab56-76cc73b7713f",/factchecks/2016/jul/05/pat-robertson/pat-robertson-misleadingly-says-obama-was-schooled/

Tom Cotton: Hillary Clinton pushed reset with Russia months after it invaded Georgia
","If you want to get a rise from a Republican lawmaker, suggest that he or she shares some common ground with presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., bristled when NBC host Chuck Todd suggested Cotton’s foreign policy positions align more closely with Clinton than with Republican presumptive nominee Donald Trump. ""I can assure you that I am not very close to Hillary Clinton,"" Cotton responded. ""She has been responsible for many of the worst decisions of the Obama administration. She was literally present when we pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia."" Cotton’s list of her failings continued, but his comment about Russia invading Georgia caught our eye, and we decided to look a little closer. Russia and Georgia Cotton’s claim focuses on the former Soviet republic of Georgia, the semi-autonomous regions of South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Tensions and violence between ethnic Georgians, South Ossetians and Abkhazians ebbed and flowed after the break-up of the Soviet Union around 1990. Under the USSR, South Ossetia and Abkhazia enjoyed substantial autonomy. Newly independent Georgian nationalists declared a unified nation with no internal borders. In 1991, Georgian forces occupied the South Ossetian capital, but resistance by Russian-backed fighters led to a stalemate. In 1992, all parties agreed to a ceasefire, which included a Russian-led peacekeeping force. There was a similar pattern of hostilities in Abkhazia that resulted in a similar solution. The presence of peacekeepers and international monitors worked for about a decade. Calm unravelled in 2004 with the election of a more nationalist leader in Georgia. There was aggression on both sides. Violence grew and on Aug. 7, 2008, after Russian-backed rebels in South Ossetia shelled ethnically Georgian villages, and the Georgian government sent in its army to take control of the region. Russia responded militarily, successfully pushing back Georgian troops from both South Ossetia and Abkhazia. Clashes continued for a week, drawing in portions of Georgia beyond the two breakaway regions, until France helped broker a peace deal. Open conflict ended on Aug. 12, 2008. Russia then recognized South Ossetia and Abkhazia as sovereign nations, though most other countries have not taken that step. Russian troops largely withdrew from Georgian soil, although some forces remained in several Georgian cities until about October 2008. The reset Jump forward to March 2009 to pick up the other point in Cotton’s statement. Newly elected President Barack Obama had campaigned that he would put relations with Russia on a less confrontational footing. Most of his focus was on scaling back the nuclear arsenals of both nations. (He promised to win Russian agreement to continue the monitoring and verification rules under the START I Treaty that were due to expire in 2009.) As part of that initiative, on March 6, 2009, in Geneva, Switzerland, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton gave her Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov a red button. The button was supposed to have word ""reset"" written on it in Russian. But the Americans got it wrong -- the word translated to ""overcharged."" Counting the months So Cotton has the basics of the story largely correct, though he’s cutting off the edges. Russian troops did participate in military activities on Georgian soil, but troops were already in place as part of a brokered peace settlement. And the Russians didn’t necessarily initiate hostilities. And while Cotton said the Americans hit the ""reset"" button ""a few months"" after the Russian invasion, the reality is it took place almost six months after the week-long conflict had ended. An invasion with a twist Susan Allen, director of the Center for Peacemaking Practice at George Mason University, calls Russia’s action an invasion because in early August 2008, Russia didn't consider South Ossetia to be an independent country. But Allen told us that beyond that legal definition, the details muddy the picture. Georgia made the first large military move. On top of that, Russian soldiers were already on the ground in South Ossetia. ""Russia had had a longstanding role as part of a peacekeeping force separating the Georgians and South Ossetians,"" Allen said. ""Yes, Russia invaded Georgia, and, yes, there is a lot more to the story."" Law professor Kenneth Anderson at American University put a lot of weight on the rest of the story. Right after the ceasefire, Anderson urged western powers to push back hard against Russian expansionism. But he reminded people of the ethnic cleansing that took place at the hands of Georgian nationalists in the 1990s, saying it was as extreme as anything he had seen in the war in the former Yugoslavia. ""The facts of South Ossetia and Abkhazia are not simply a narrative of Russia stirring up trouble in an otherwise untroubled corner of the world,"" Anderson wrote in a 2008 article. ""This conflict got started 15 years ago, and although on again and off again, it has never stopped.  Neither its existence nor its persistence are due to Russian imperial expansion alone."" For Cotton to bring up Russia’s invasion of Georgia might invoke more recent memories of Russia’s clear aggression in Ukraine when it seized control of the Crimean peninsula. But the circumstances were quite different, as was the western reaction. The Crimean seizure produced hard sanctions against Russia, including expulsion from the G-8. In contrast, in 2008, the George W. Bush administration made only cautious moves to register its disapproval of Russia. David L. Phillips, director of Columbia University’s program on peace-building and rights, told PolitFact in 2014 that ""there was never any chance of the Bush administration going to war in Georgia, and everybody knew that."" Regarding the impact of the ""reset"", some observers say it helped. Political scientist Andrew Kuchins at the Center for Strategic and International Studies wrote in 2011 that relations between Russia and America ""steadily improved."" Kuchins credits the diplomatic shift with producing a new START treaty and winning Russian support for stronger sanctions against Iran. Our ruling Cotton said Clinton ""pressed the reset button with Russia just a few months after Russia had invaded Georgia."" Cotton shrinks the timeframe and oversimplifies the nature of the Russian action. Yet, while imperfect, his words are not necessarily an inaccurate retelling of history.

ACLU: North Carolina police will have significant power to keep body cam, dash cam footage secret
","A bill that passed the N.C. General Assembly on Wednesday will create statewide rules for police body camera and dash camera footage, if Gov. Pat McCrory signs it into law. UPDATE 7/11/16: McCrory signed the bill into law. The bill’s main sponsors – two Republican members of the N.C. House who are retired law enforcement officers – have said it strikes a balance between the interests of police and the public. But open-government advocates including the state American Civil Liberties Union chapter say the opposite – that this bill would give police inordinate power to keep footage shielded from the public. ""Giving law enforcement such broad authority to keep video footage secret – even from individuals who are filmed – will damage law enforcement’s ability to build trust with the public and destroy any potential this technology had to make officers more accountable to the communities they serve,"" said ACLU attorney Susanna Birdsong in a news release. We can’t see the future, so we won’t try to say whether keeping video footage secret will damage law enforcement’s public image and accountability. But we can look at just how easily footage could be kept secret if the bill becomes law. Two levels of publicity The bill would establish two ways for members of the public to view police video – disclosure and release. 1. Disclosure: When people are allowed to watch the video but can’t make copies of it or otherwise show it to the general public. Disclosure would only be available to people who are seen or heard in their video (or people who represent them, like lawyers or guardians). And even then it’s not guaranteed. Like the ACLU said, police can still decide the video requires so much secrecy that even people in the video can’t see it. 2. Release: The more typical meaning of something being made public. It’s an option for anyone who believes the video footage should be available for the public to see at any time. That includes reporters who wish to show the footage the the public as well as people who want copies of the footage to use as evidence in lawsuits, for example. Under the proposed law, release would only be possible if a judge signs off on the request. The status quo For any type of police video footage right now, there’s no explicit statewide standard. What’s considered public varies from agency to agency, according to Frayda Bluestein, a UNC-Chapel Hill law and government professor. One of the bill’s cosponsors, Asheboro Republican Allen McNeill, argued that the bill will improve transparency since many agencies now make these videos personnel records, which are hard for the public to access. Bluestein has studied the issue for years. She said most videos are considered investigative records, although some are classified as personnel records. In either case, she said, it’s still possible for the public to successfully open up those records simply by asking the agency. And if that fails, the courts are there to decide who is right. But the proposed law would make a trip to court the only option, even for the most innocuous footage. Who gains from transparency? Nationwide, police footage of officers shooting, choking and beating people have given rise to civil lawsuits, criminal charges and movements like Black Lives Matter. The Raleigh News & Observer recently used jailhouse video obtained by a public records request in Harnett County to show the official account of an inmate’s death differed from what actually happened. Other times, the police themselves have released videos in order to defend their officers’ actions. It’s rare in North Carolina, but not unheard of. Greensboro officials released body cam video last month of an officer shooting and killing a woman in 2014. Last year Lincolnton police released body cam footage leading up to an officer shooting a dog. In 2009 Chatham County officials released portions of dash cam video of a car chase that led to a fatal shooting. Who watches the watchmen? Birdsong said police will have ""broad authority"" to deny people the right to see video, including video of themselves. For disclosure requests the bill gives six provisions, saying officials ""may consider any of the following factors in determining if a recording is disclosed."" Those give police a wide range of options for denial: if the video contains otherwise confidential information, if it’s deemed ""sensitive"" or revealing, if it might harm someone’s reputation, if it might harm someone’s safety, or if it’s related to an active, inactive or potential criminal or internal investigation. ""The 'may consider' portion of that is the part that is the most concerning to me,"" Birdsong said. If denied, people can appeal to a judge. But the law will force the judge to give latitude to the police’s original decision – the judge can only overrule police if he finds an ""abuse of discretion."" Getting the record made public All that was just to be able to watch the video one time, without being able to make a copy or show other people. What about people who want to make it fully public? That decision would be entirely up to a judge. But one public records attorney we spoke with, Mike Tadych, said it could be difficult to argue to a judge that video should be released if no member of the public has been able to see the video. That’s because the law would also require judges to only release the parts of the video specifically described in court. ""I don’t know how in the world, without knowing what's on it, you would be able to say you know what's on it,"" Tadych said. Furthermore, anytime a judge is deciding whether to make footage public, the law would require that the local district attorney, the head of the agency that took the video and any officer whose image or voice is on the video must be notified and given a chance to testify. There are no such rights for the private citizens whose image or voice is in the footage. Our ruling The ACLU said if the bill becomes law, police will have ""broad authority to keep video footage secret – even from individuals who are filmed."" Police can stop individuals who were filmed by police from viewing the video, using broad and sometimes vague reasoning. And even on appeal, judges have limited authority to overrule the police. Police won't be able to decide if a video is made completely open to the public. Only a judge will. But in any given case, a number of law enforcement officials will have rights of notification and testimony that aren’t given to the regular individuals who are also in the video. We rate this claim True. After The Fact Gov. Pat McCrory signed the body cam bill into law on Monday, July 11. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/236400b3-7fa7-47c7-b200-7ff1e8dd16ab",/factchecks/2016/jul/01/aclu-north-carolina/aclu-north-carolina-police-will-have-significant-p/

What's missing from media claims linking Google Trends to Brexit vote
","One of the punch lines in the Brexit vote fallout has been that people in the United Kingdom didn’t even know they were voting to leave the European Union. The evidence came from Google. News stories and Facebook posts pointed out that searches in the UK on basic questions like ""what is the EU?"" and ""what does it mean to leave the EU?"" spiked after the Brexit vote. Daily Mail, a daily British tabloid, posted an article with the headline: ""Google search spike suggests many people don’t know why they voted for Brexit."" The paper pointed to a spike in the query ""what happens if we leave the EU,"" as evidence voters were unaware they voted to leave.  The Washington Post also posted an article on the trend implying that voters in the United Kingdom didn’t know exactly what they were voting for. Even John Oliver poked fun at the trend on HBO’s Last Week Tonight. ""It’s frankly hard not to think that some Britons may not have fully thought this through,"" Oliver said ""Especially when you look at some of the top search terms concerning the EU the next day."" But the Google Trends don’t show that at all, in reality. Here’s why. What Google Trends tells us (and doesn’t) Google Trends launched 10 years ago as a way to allow users to track the popularity of a search item in relation to an event. The search data categorizes searches into related groups and then measures the interest in a particular topic across searches from around the world, right down to cities. For example, these were the top five questions in the United Kingdom on Google Trends after the Brexit vote on June 23. The queries represent the most-searched items relating to the European Union.  What Google Trends doesn’t tell us is who is actually doing the searching. So there’s no way to tell if the searches were done by Brexit voters. Another issue is the significance of the searches in comparison to other factors. A 250 percent spike doesn’t mean much if not many people were searching ""what happens if we leave the EU?"" prior to the report. The number of searches before the vote is hard to determine ""The problem with Google Trends is that it's essentially a black box,"" said Pete Meyers, a marketing scientist at Moz which sells marketing analytics software subscriptions. ""There's a lot we don't know about what goes into the number, and everything is relative."" For instance, when you look at ""What is the EU,"" on Google Trends, you see a spike. But when you add the term ""Brexit"" to the same graph the spike seems far less severe, he said. Although the raw totals of searches are not shown, the Trends data shows searches for ""Brexit"" were much higher than ""What is the EU?"" on June 24, the day after the vote.    Google Trends looks at a random sample of all searches, so you don’t see the total number of specific searches. The numbers on the chart represent a probability of how highly searched a query is, ranked from 1 to 100. This allows Google to compare two terms against one another. The volume of searches can be a self-fulfilling prophecy, Meyers said. ""If Google reports that a lot of people are searching for ‘What is the EU?’ and then the press picks it up, curiosity leads people to run similar searches to see what the fuss is about,"" Meyers said. He said he can’t prove that’s what happened here, but it has happened in the past. Another major flaw in using Google Trends to make bold pronouncements like the Daily Mail is that the most common way to search something is usually the term that shows up at the top, said Marti Hearst, a professor for the University of California at Berkeley’s school of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences. ""Only the most common (and therefore the most ignorant-sounding) search queries will make it to the top,"" Hearst said. In other words, nuance questions like, ""How does Northumberland elected representative to the EU support our interests,"" would not surface to the top, she said.   Experts agreed that the way many news outlets used the Google Trends reports is not grounded in science. ""The numbers shown to the public are processed in many ways and are meant to be very general trends only,"" Hearst said. The claims that publications are making go too far, said Tom Davenport, the President’s Distinguished Professor of Information Technology and Management at Babson College. ""I might interpret the findings more positively,"" Davenport said. ""At least a lot of people have curiosity and are trying to learn more about the Brexit topic."" Our ruling Like other media accounts, the Daily Mail headline said ""Google search spike suggests many people don’t know why they voted for Brexit."" This is misleading. It’s impossible to say if UK voters were the ones doing these searches, and the numbers of searches are hard to determine. Relative to searches for ""Brexit,"" searches about ""what is the EU"" were far less common. We know people searched ""What is the EU"" and ""What will happen if we leave the EU,"" but we don’t know why or how many. Point being, there’s no evidence to fill those gaps.

Hillary Clinton says Cincinnati runs on 100 percent clean power
","Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren and presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton had a lot of nice things to say about Cincinnati during their first campaign appearance together in the Ohio city. Clinton gave props to Cincinnati’s mayor and applauded one city achievement in particular. ""Cincinnati is already one of the biggest cities in the country to run 100 percent on clean energy,"" she said. ""Congratulations."" But what does it mean to say that Cincy ""runs"" on clean energy? Buses powered by photosynthesis? City government meets by candlelight? We popped the hood for a closer look. It’s more complicated than the city no longer using ""dirty"" power. In 2011, Cincinnati voters approved a ballot initiative allowing the city to bargain for electricity on behalf of its residents. The following year, the City Council accepted a bid from FirstEnergy Solutions to offer a 100 percent Renewable Energy Credit option to the city’s 53,000 residential and commercial electric customers. One renewable energy credit represents one megawatt-hour of renewable electricity produced by facilities like wind farms, solar canopies or hydro-electric dams. People in Cincinnati still get their power over the wires owned by Duke Energy, the traditional, coal-burning electric utility for the area. But FirstEnergy Solutions, as Cincinnati’s ""aggregation provider,"" buys a mix of both locally produced renewable electricity and renewable energy credits on the city’s behalf. Renewable energy credits are coded and retired, once purchased, and are used to track the ownership of environmental and social benefits of the renewable energy, not the electricity itself. It's complicated stuff, but we'll guide you through it. Say you're part of Cincinnati's FirstEnergy program, which you would be by default unless you opted-out. (Residents got a letter saying they could.) Your lights turn on using the same electricity as someone who opted to stick with conventional, coal-fed electricity, because once electricity is placed on the electrical grid, it becomes indistinguishable from the electricity generated by other sources. But when you pay your bill, you're paying for an equivalent supply of power from renewable sources being fed into the grid, be it locally or elsewhere.  Larry Falkin, the director of Cincinnati’s Office of Environment and Sustainability, confirmed that 43,090 electric customers in the city and 1,287 small businesses participated in the renewable energy credit program in 2015, for a total of 405,737 megawatt hours. That's about 81 percent of the 53,000 households in Cincinnati. In past years, FirstEnergy’s renewable electricity sources have included the power generated from captured coal mine methane gas at the University of Cincinnati’s Central Utility Plant, and solar power generated at a solar canopy at the Cincinnati Zoo. FirstEnergy has also tapped wind farms in Iowa and Texas, and hydro-electric power from facilities in Virginia and Pennsylvania. There is a hitch. Critics of renewable energy credits argue that it’s almost impossible to confirm that a renewable credit actually displaces a megawatt-hour from a dirty source, like coal. ""It would be great if the purchase of certificates made up the difference between conventional and renewable power, but at best this is a token subsidy for renewable energy,"" Daniel Press, an environmental studies professor at the University of California, Santa Cruz, wrote in an editorial for the San Jose Mercury Press. Some large corporations that once embraced the renewable-credit model for greening up their profiles have since ditched the credits. Johnson & Johnson is one such company that enthusiastically purchased voluntary clean-energy credits in 2000, but has since backed off that strategy. Jed Richardson, J&J’s global energy director, said, ""We decided we were better off investing in renewable generation on our own properties."" The Cincinnati City Council defended the renewable credit system from a challenge in 2014, when the interim city manager recommended returning to Duke Energy for power. The clean-powered households saved as much as 28 percent off their utility bills when the program began. But because of market fluctuations, the savings in the green program had dropped to 8 percent. The city manager reversed his stance when the majority of the council defended the clean energy program. City Councilman Chris Seelbach told PolitiFact Ohio, ""I successfully led efforts in 2014 to continue having 100 percent of our electricity backed by renewable credits after our administration recommended against it. Fortunately, the administration recommended renewable energy this year, so we didn’t have to fight them."" Other cities that have gone 100 percent renewable include Burlington, Vt. (population 42,452), Greensburg, Kan. (population 798), and Aspen, Colo. (population 6,882). With a population of 297,517, Cincinnati is one of the biggest cities to use this program. Our ruling Clinton congratulated Cincinnati for being ""one of the biggest cities in the country to run 100 percent on clean energy."" Clinton's phrasing makes it sound like Cincinnati is free of coal-fed power. The reality — the city's 100 percent Renewable Energy Credit option — is more complicated. While there are critics of the renewable energy credit system, it is currently the only way to ensure the purchase of power from green sources. The most recent reports show that 43,090 Cincinnati households and 1,287 small businesses participate in the city’s Electricity Aggregation Program. That’s not 100 percent of Cincinnati’s energy consumers — it’s about 81 percent of households. But those who are enrolled in the Electricity Aggregation Program can claim that they’re running on 100 percent renewable sources — or as close to it as anyone can get, while staying on the grid.

Did Hillary Clinton launder millions of dollars while she was secretary of state?
","Donald Trump assailed Hillary Clinton’s credibility in a rapid response email following her speech on economics on June 21. Trump claimed that Clinton used her role as secretary of state as a vehicle to funnel government money to her husband. ""As secretary of state, Hillary Clinton laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education, while Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of the group,"" the email said. ""Clinton's State Department provided $55.2 million in grants to Laureate Education from 2010-2012. Laureate thanked Bill for providing unbelievable access to the secretary of state by paying him off $16.5 million. This is yet another example of how Clinton treated the State Department as her own personal hedge fund, and sold out the American public to fund her lavish lifestyle."" Laureate Education is a network of more than 80 for-profit educational institutions that operate in 30 countries. Bill Clinton was named Laureate’s honorary chancellor in 2010 and maintained this position until 2015. His role chiefly consisted of advising the company on educational matters and traveling to campuses across the world to speak to young people. The Trump campaign did not respond to our requests for clarification, but his argument seems to be based off of claims made in Peter Schweizer’s book Clinton Cash. In the book, Schweizer describes what he calls the ""Clinton blur"" between the activities of Bill and Hillary Clinton, the State Department and associated nonprofits and corporations. We decided to investigate Trump’s claim that Hillary Clinton, who was secretary from 2009 through early 2013, ""laundered"" money to Laureate to pay off her husband’s salary. We ultimately found that there is zero evidence that Laureate received any money from the federal government while Clinton was at the State Department. Bill Clinton and Laureate Education Neither Bill Clinton nor Laureate Education disclosed his compensation as honorary chancellor. However, his tax returns show that Laureate paid him approximately $16.5 million between 2010 and 2014. We looked to usaspending.gov to find out if Laureate received any funding from the State Department. The site tracks the amount of money given to various organizations through government grants and contracts. According to this database, Laureate did not receive any money from any federal agency while Bill Clinton was in his role, nor while Hillary Clinton was secretary of state. State Department Spokesperson John Kirby said in a statement, ""The State Department is not aware of any grants provided directly to Laureate Education since 2009, though we are aware of some grants to educational institutions within or affiliated with the Laureate Education network."" The International Youth Foundation Clinton Cash draws a connection between Laureate Education and the International Youth Foundation, a nonprofit that supports youth employment, entrepreneurship and social innovation across the world. The book notes that Laureate Chairman Douglas Becker is also chairman of the foundation’s board of directors. The foundation’s profile on usaspending.gov shows that it received approximately $72.6 million in grants between fiscal years 2009 and 2013. Trump gets to his $55.2 million figure by summing the grant money received between 2010 and 2012. We looked at the grant money given to the International Youth Foundation by the government between 2009 and 2013. FY 2009: $9M from USAID FY 2010: $17M from USAID FY 2011: $14.6M from USAID FY 2012: $23.6M from USAID. $1.9 million from State Department. FY 2013: $10.4M from USAID The grant money shown on usaspending.gov appears to have sharply increased while Hillary Clinton was at the State Department, which is the gist of the claim that Trump’s source makes. However, he fails to mention several key facts that undermine the logic of his claim. First, the International Youth Foundation had been receiving similar amounts of grant money before Hillary Clinton joined the State Department. An open letter by CEO William Reese claims that they negotiated a grant in 2008 under President George W. Bush for $30.2 million for a USAID mission in Jordan. He says that the money from this grant was handed out over several years, overlapping with new grants from President Barack Obama, giving the false impression that funding had sharply increased after Clinton became secretary of state. We looked at financial records provided by the foundation and confirmed the existence and size of the grants. The records show that approximately $24 million from the grant was dispensed between 2010 and 2012. Second, almost all of the grants came from USAID, which is a separate agency than the State Department. Is it possible that Hillary Clinton had influence over the USAID grant process while she was secretary of state? A State Department spokesperson told us the two agencies have separate grant and contract offices, separate procurement offices and their own rules with regards to the grant process. ""State would not have oversight of or be involved in the USAID grant process — grants are let through a competitive process that the agency itself undertakes,"" said Jennifer Kates, vice president and director of Global Health & HIV Policy at the Kaiser Family Foundation, who is familiar with the agencies’ grant processes. Finally, there is no evidence to indicate that the International Youth Foundation is a sister organization of Laureate that could be used to transfer money to the company. Schweizer points to Douglas Becker to imply that the organizations are linked. However, Becker isn’t paid for his position at the foundation and has no official executive role. In an interview with PolitiFact, Reese of the International Youth Foundation expanded on their relationship with Laureate. ""If we were a subordinate organization we would have to state that in our 990. If we were to transfer money over to Laureate we would have to put that,"" Reese said. ""We’ve received money from Laureate but never given money to them."" Reese stated that the two organizations have worked together on a variety of projects related to global development in the past, such as a relief project for the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. The foundation’s records show that it’s been receiving between $100,000 and $1.4 million per year from Laureate since 2003, seven years before Bill Clinton joined Laureate. When we asked about any relationship Bill Clinton had with the International Youth Foundation, Reese said, ""No contractual or employment or consulting agreements have been made with President Clinton."" The foundation’s profile on Charitynavigator.org, a site that ranks nonprofits according to transparency and accountability, shows that it’s a respected charity with a score of 94.26 out of 100 possible points. The foundation has worked with various other high-profile partners such as Nokia and Barclays since 1990. Our ruling Trump said Hillary Clinton ""laundered money to Bill Clinton through Laureate Education, while Bill Clinton was an honorary chairman of the group."" That's a serious of charge of illegal activity. Actually, the State Department under Clinton never made any direct transfers to Laureate Education. Trump’s source conflates Laureate with a separate charitable organization that received funds from a separate government agency. The International Youth Foundation is a respected nonprofit that has received money from the government since the Bush years, before Clinton joined the State Department.

Hillary Clinton accurately says Donald Trump's plan is good for hedge funders
","Hillary Clinton is attacking Donald Trump’s tax plan, saying it actually benefits the hedge fund managers Trump had promised to cut down to size. ""Now, before releasing his plan, Trump said, ‘Hedge fund guys are getting away with murder.’ And he added, ‘They’ll pay more,’ "" Clinton said. ""Then his plan came out. And it actually makes the current loophole even worse.

""And I did have to look twice because I didn’t believe it. Under Donald Trump’s plan, these Wall Street millionaires will pay a lower tax rate than many working people."" Trump’s plan does roll back one high-profile advantage for hedge fund partners. Is Clinton right to say they still come out ahead? Trump took an aggressive position on tax rates for hedge fund managers during his fight for the Republican nomination. In an interview with CBS in August, Trump called them ""paper pushers"" who ""did not build this country."" In a Republican debate in September, Trump said his tax plan would make them pay more. ""The hedge fund guys won’t like me as much as they like me right now. I know them all, but they’ll pay more,"" Trump said. After the Republican debate, Trump released the outline of his tax plan. Trump’s plan eliminates the so-called carried interest tax loophole, which allows general partners in private investment firms (including most hedge fund managers) to treat some of their income as income from investments, or capital gains, subject to a top tax rate of 23.8 percent, instead of the much higher tax rate for ordinary income (43.4 percent). Under Trump’s plan, income from carried interest would no longer be treated as capital gains. Tax rates for ordinary income tops out at 25 percent under Trump’s plan. This looks like a hike in line with Trump’s promises. Except. Along with private equity and venture capital funds, many hedge funds are structured as partnerships. Under Trump’s plan, income through a business partnership is taxed at a rate of no more than 15 percent, significantly less than the 23.8 percent they previously paid, according to an analysis of Trump’s tax plan from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center. Eliminating the carried interest ""loophole"" actually helps these hedge fund managers under Trump’s plan. If carried interest was still treated as capital gains, it could be taxed at the top rate for capital gains in the plan (20 percent), higher than the fixed 15 percent tax for partnership income. Trump’s plan presents the discounted rate for partnership income as a way to help ""the small businesses that are the true engine of our economy."" It also helps large businesses and wealthy financiers who structure their businesses as partnerships, including the hedge funds managers he attacked in his campaign. Clinton also said that rates for hedge fund managers would be lower than for middle-class families under Trump’s plan. Defining the middle class can be tricky, but in the Pew Research Center’s range of $42,000 to $125,000 for a household of three in 2014, a substantial number of middle-class households would make enough to qualify for a marginal tax rate of more than 15 percent if Trump’s plan were enacted. Not all of these people would pay more than 15 percent overall, according to Bob Williams at the Tax Policy Center, and it would be difficult to say how many middle-income people would pay more than hedge fund managers once the many different variables involved played out. But some would, Williams wrote in an email. In May, Politico reported that the Trump campaign had engaged two economists to craft a new tax plan. The Trump campaign has not confirmed whether they plan to re-write their tax plan, and did not respond to Politico’s request for comment. The tax plan announced in September remains on Trump's website, and is the basis of this article. The Trump campaign did not respond to our request for comment on this article. Our ruling Clinton said Trump’s proposed tax rate for hedge fund managers ""makes the current loophole even worse."" She has a point. By setting a lower tax rate for income from business partnerships, Trump’s tax plan would benefit many hedge fund managers. Though the plan would cut tax rates for middle-class families as well, the cuts that would apply to most hedge fund managers are steeper and their resulting tax rate is lower. Trump promised that his tax plan would roll back advantages for hedge fund managers. Instead, in most cases, it would improve their position.

In a poem, U.S.Rep. Gwen Moore says terrorists can be banned from flying but can buy assault weapons
","On Facebook and Twitter, U.S. Rep. Gwen Moore describes herself as a mother and grandmother who ""loves poetry, reading, knitting and crocheting."" With poetry, she not only reads, she writes. The Milwaukee Democrat has penned odes that tweak job creators and Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker. (There are videos of her reciting both.) Most recently, Moore turned her rhyming to guns. On June 23, 2016, about a week after the Orlando mass shooting, she tweeted out her poem, ""No More Moments of Silence."" One line reads: How ironic that if you're a terrorist you can't fly / But quite moronic that an assault weapon you can buy. Leaving aside the adjectives, let’s check the veracity of the verse. Two lists Moore’s claim alludes to two U.S. government lists whose origins stem from 9/11. 1. Terrorist watchlist: The Terrorist Screening Database, commonly called the ""terrorist watchlist,"" contains people ""known or reasonably suspected to be or have been engaged in terrorism or terrorist activities."" It helps agencies ""identify known or suspected terrorists trying to obtain visas, enter the country, board aircraft, or engage in other activity."" As of mid-June 2016, there were about 1 million people on the terrorist watchlist, though fewer than 5,000 were Americans, according to a federal agencies memo to Congress. 2. No Fly List: This is a subset of the terrorist watchlist. People on the no fly list are ""prohibited from boarding a commercial aircraft that will fly into, out of, over, or within United States airspace."" A person can be added to that list if there is ""credible information that demonstrates the individual poses a threat of committing a violent act of terrorism with respect to civil aviation, the homeland, United States interests located abroad, or is operationally capable of doing so.""   There are about 81,000 people on the no fly list, including fewer than 1,000 Americans. A key difference between the two lists, of course, is there is no constitutional right to fly but there is one to own a gun. Moore’s claim The first part of Moore’s claim, that terrorists can’t fly, is pretty straightforward. You don’t have to be a known terrorist to be prohibited from flying. As we noted, people who the government believes pose a threat of committing terrorism in connection with air travel, and are on the no fly list, also are prohibited. The second part of her claim -- that terrorists can buy assault weapons -- goes a bit too far, in that not all of the people on the terrorist watchlist are terrorists. Many are only suspected to be involved in terrorist activities and, like the Orlando shooter was, are removed from the list.  Moreover, terrorists who have been convicted of a felony, or are under indictment, can’t legally buy a gun. But Moore’s point, contrasting the no fly list with the terrorist watchlist, is on target in that people on the watchlist can buy guns. Under federal law, there is no basis to automatically prohibit a person from possessing firearms simply because they appear on the terrorist watchlist. There must be some other disqualifying factor, such as a felony conviction, illegal immigration status, or being under indictment. In fact, from 2004 through 2015, according to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, individuals on the terrorist watchlist were involved in firearm or explosives background checks 2,477 times, of which 91 percent were allowed to proceed. Our rating Moore said: ""If you're a terrorist you can't fly,"" but ""an assault weapon you can buy."" Terrorists, as well as people deemed potential terrorists who are on the federal government’s no-fly list are prohibited from flying. Terrorists who have a felony conviction can’t legally buy guns, but people on the government’s terrorist watchlist can, assuming they aren’t disqualified for some other reason. We rate Moore’s statement Mostly True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/7cd9be64-3f40-453e-9c76-a1b2648fccf7",/factchecks/2016/jul/01/gwen-moore/poem-rep-gwen-moore-says-terrorists-can-be-banned-/
"['Oregon', 'Crime', 'Women', 'Suzanne Bonamici']","
Are one in four women and one in seven men victims of domestic violence?
","
We live in a violent, dangerous world. Most people accept that information as real, though abstract.

But when Rep. Suzanne Bonamici, D-Ore., spoke from the House floor May 16 during debate on whether to renew the Violence Against Women Act, she drove the point home.

""One in four women and one in seven men have been victims of domestic violence in their lifetime,"" she said. That’s not the least bit abstract. In a nation of 311 million people it’s also very large.

But is it true?

We asked Bonamici’s office for her documentation. Spokeswoman Leah Nelson said the statement was based on information from a Congressional Research Service analysis of the Violence Against Women Act. CRS is the nonpartisan research arm of Congress that provides detailed and rigorous analysis of issues and legislation for members of Congress. Nelson provided a copy of the May 2012 report.

To find the answer you have to first understand what the term means. Research by the Justice Department, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and even the Department of Defense define domestic violence in a precise and similar way. It includes sexual violence, stalking, and ""intimate partner violence.""

According to a landmark 2010 study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- whose numbers are also used by the CRS --  sexual violence includes rape and sexual coercion, which is another way of describing a person ""pressured in a non-physical way."" In addition to what most people consider sexual violence involving physical acts, the CDC report said, there can also be ""non-contact unwanted sexual experience"" such as people exposing themselves and ""making a victim … look at or participate in sexual photos or movies,"" among other acts.

CDC researchers considered a wide array of actions to fall within the definition of domestic violence. Stalking was included, as was psychological aggression and control of reproductive or sexual health.

The CRS’ definition is similarly broad.  

With that background, it’s time to turn to Bonamici’s attention-grabbing claim - one-in-four women and one-in-seven men are victims of severe domestic abuse during their lifetime. Her comment focuses on a subset of the larger - and most damaging - behavior defined as domestic abuse.

You don’t have to look long. On page 2 of the CDC report’s executive summary is this sentence:

""About 1 in 4 women (24.3%) and 1 in 7 men (13.8%) have experienced severe physical violence by an intimate partner (e.g., hit with a fist or something hard, beaten, slammed against something) at some point in their lifetime.""

The numbers are repeated on page 43 of the 124-page report. Sprinkled throughout the report are detailed analyses of each segment of the claim.

While the broader study includes behavior that many people would not normally associate with domestic abuse, Bonamici’s statistics refer directly to ""severe physical violence,"" acts that include rape and assault and violent behavior that easily falls within the common understanding of domestic abuse.

We rate this claim True.",/factchecks/2012/may/25/suzanne-bonamici/are-one-four-women-and-one-seven-men-victims-domes/
"['New Hampshire', 'Health Care', 'State Budget', ""William O'Brien""]","
O'Brien says health care employment has grown, despite state cuts
","
To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the demise of New Hampshire’s health care system have been greatly exaggerated – according to Speaker of the House William O’Brien, at least. 
Last year, the New Hampshire House of Representatives passed its $10.3 billion budget, which cut millions in funding for hospitals and health care providers. 
Funding to nursing homes was reduced by more than $30 million, according to administrators who decried the cuts, and hospitals lost $258 million over the two-year budget. 
But now, a year later, not only has the bleeding stopped, but the health care industry has even gained jobs since the budget passed, according to O’Brien, R-Mont Vernon. 
""You know what’s interesting about those layoffs?"" O’Brien asked rhetorically during a May 7 meeting with The Telegraph’s editorial board. ""There’s 400 more people working in health care today in New Hampshire than when we passed the budget."" 
In recent years, health care has been one of few industries to grow despite the recession. But did New Hampshire’s health care industry not only rebound from the cuts, but grow to the tune of 400 jobs? We decided to crunch the numbers. 
When asked for the source of O’Brien’s figures, Shannon Shutts, a spokeswoman for the House of Representatives, pointed to the New Hampshire Employment Security agency. The office, which runs the state’s job centers and manages unemployment benefits, issues both quarterly and monthly employment reports estimating job growth in specific industries. 
According to the Employment Security office’s Current Employment Statistics report, 84,900 people worked in New Hampshire’s health care and social assistance fields in April 2012, the most recent numbers available. That number, based on employment surveys of selected hospitals, outpatient clinics, nursing homes and home care agencies, among others, is exactly the same as April 2011 and 100 fewer than March 2011. So that doesn’t show the gain O’Brien claimed. 
The House of Representatives passed its budget March 31, 2011, but it didn’t approve the final version of the budget for another three months, until June 22, 2011. 
According to the state jobs office, employment in the health care and social assistance sectors in June 2011 was 85,600. But it declined by 700 more by April 2012. 
In addition, at the time O’Brien made the claim May 7, the April 2012 unemployment numbers hadn’t been posted to the state’s website. If we calculate his claim using the March 2012 data that was available at the time, the numbers look even worse, since there were 400 fewer health care jobs in March than in April 2012. 
""What you see in health care is really more of a slowdown,"" said Annette Nielsen, an economist with the economic and labor market information bureau within the employment security office. 
""A couple of years ago, you would see 2 or 3 percent strong growth over the year, and then even through the beginning of the recession, that was really the only bright spot there was,"" she said. ""That is definitely slowing down."" 
The state’s health care employment numbers, as classified by the economic security office, include both health care and social assistance jobs. Health care jobs include those working in hospitals, medical centers, outpatient clinics and nursing homes. Meanwhile, social assistance is defined as child care workers and home care providers for the elderly and those with disabilities, among others. 
But even without considering the social assistance fields, O’Brien’s numbers are still off. 
Hospitals across the state gained 100 jobs from April 2011 to April 2012, rising to 28,300 last month, according to the state report. But ambulatory care services, including chiropractors, optometrists, podiatrists, mental health professionals and diagnostic technicians, lost 1,300 jobs during that period. 
Compared to figures from June 2011, ambulatory care jobs were down 1,500 in April 2012 and hospital jobs suffered 200 losses, according to the state data. 
Admittedly, the state’s monthly job estimates are not perfect, acknowledged Nielson, of the employment security office. The figures are based on surveys collected from a sampling of employers, which are often returned late, and they don’t always reflect new and emerging businesses, she said. 
For a more accurate measure, economists often look to the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages report. 
The report, released every three months, is based on actual employment data reported to the employment security office for unemployment benefits claims. But because the data takes time to collect and analyze, reports are released only every three months. The most report reflects employment data through September 2011. 
According to that data, from April 2011 to September 2011, six months after the House passed the state budget and the longest period of available data, the number of people working in health care in the state grew by 402 jobs. Yet when using the June starting date, when the state budget took effect, there was a loss of 178 jobs during the next quarter of a year. 
Either way, this data is now eight months old, and much can – and likely has – changed in that time, Nielson said. 
""You can’t compare the two,"" she said. ""They’re two different time periods. … The trend is (that job growth is) really starting to flatten out."" 
Our ruling 
The health care industry was a bright spot during the recession, but job estimates show that it didn’t rebound from the state budget cuts the way O’Brien reported. The most recent state estimates show that jobs in the health care industry, combined with social assistance, have remained flat or even decreased – not gained – since April 2011, when the House initially passed the budget. And since the state budget took effect in June 2011, the industry has lost about 700 jobs. There is one measure that shows some growth, but it was only a snapshot and doesn’t cover the time period O’Brien was talking about. Based on the most authoritative numbers that include the most recent data, we rate this claim False.",/factchecks/2012/may/25/william-obrien/obrien-says-health-care-employment-has-grown-despi/

Crossroads ad says Obama has failed to stem foreclosure crisis
","
As the economic collapse began to threaten homeowners, presidential candidate Barack Obama vowed to come to their aid.

""We must help the millions of homeowners facing foreclosure,"" he said on the campaign trail in June 2008. His plan called for changes in bankruptcy laws, a crackdown on predatory and fraudulent lenders and a $10 billion fund to help homeowners avoid foreclosure.

With Obama seeking re-election in 2012, his record on the foreclosure crisis is under attack. The Republican group Crossroads GPS said in a recent television ad that Obama broke his promise to help struggling homeowners. The ad shows Obama saying he would help them and then stamps ""BROKEN"" on the screen.

PolitiFact examined the Crossroads claim and found that, indeed, Obama has had limited success with his plans to ease the mortgage crisis.

""I don't think there's much doubt, even within the administration, that the (foreclosure assistance) programs overpromised and underperformed -- embarrassingly so,"" said Ken Harney, who writes a weekly syndicated real estate column.

'They wimped out'

During the 2008 campaign and his first few months in office, Obama promised a lot: 
● $10 billion foreclosure prevention fund to help struggling homeowners

● Change in bankruptcy law to allow judges to modify mortgage loan terms

● Tax credits for struggling homeowners

● A crackdown on predatory and fraudulent lenders

● Better disclosure about mortgages to home-buyers

● A moratorium on foreclosures

The results, experts say, have been mixed at best. Obama himself says the housing crisis is the most stubborn issue he has faced.

""If we were not a capitalist economy, it would be very easy,"" said Ken Thomas, an independent bank analyst and economist in Miami. ""We’re a market-regulated economy, we’re not a government-regulated economy. That makes it very hard for the government to do anything.""

The Fraud Enforcement and Recovery Act, which Obama signed in 2009, makes it a federal crime to make a materially false statement on a mortgage application or to willfully overvalue a property to influence any action by a mortgage lending business. PolitiFact's Obameter gave that a Promise Kept. And new standards for helping people understand their mortgage were included in the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul passed in 2010, another Promise Kept.

But he's had limited success with the promises that would have provided the biggest help to homeowners, according to five experts we interviewed. A temporary foreclosure moratorium happened in early 2009 as banks halted their filings while they waited for the new administration to get its plan in place to address the crisis. It’s not clear, though, that it ultimately kept many people out of foreclosure.

Analysts say the change in bankruptcy law to allow judges to modify individual loans could have made a significant difference, but it died in Congress.

""That sort of took the wind out of the program, in a way. If it had passed, it would have put much more fire under the feet of the mortgage servicers,"" said Alex Schwartz, a professor of urban policy at the New School and author of the book Housing Policy in the United States. Instead, he said, ""you were left with voluntary participation of servicers.""

The foreclosure prevention fund was the heart of his promise. He originally pledged $10 billion but ended up setting aside $75 billion, using TARP funds. He predicted the money would assist 9 million homeowners.

But after three years, only about 2 million people have won permanent mortgage help, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

The two main programs were dubbed HAMP and HARP. Under the Home Affordable Modification Program, or HAMP, lenders were encouraged to restructure loans for borrowers who were struggling to pay. The banks received small payments from the government as incentive. The Home Affordable Refinance Program, or HARP, aimed to help people refinance their loans at lower interest rates.

""Everything has fallen short of original expectations,"" said Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s.

Other experts agree.

""Obama’s program was overly complicated, it was voluntary, it was at a retail level, requiring people to call in and work with individual servicers. It was a mess,"" Schwartz said. (On our Obameter, we've rated the foreclosure fund a Promise Broken because it fell far short of Obama's goal of helping 9 million homeowners.)

Another shortcoming of the programs: The Obama administration did not require banks to include principal reduction in modifications. The programs allowed loan servicers to reduce loan balances, but it shocked no one when most banks opted not to.

Making that a requirement would have gone a long way toward keeping people in their homes.

""There’s a real risk that when people are so severely underwater, they could walk away from their mortgages,"" Schwartz said. ""So you can make a strong case for principal reduction.""

Harney, the real estate columnist, also blamed the president for not flexing more political muscle with the banks.

""At a time when the administration could have pushed the big TARP-recipient banks much harder on modifications, short sales and principal reductions, they wimped out,"" Harney said. ""Whether the close connections between Wall Street and the new White House/Treasury staff got in the way of stronger designs, I don't know. The numbers speak for themselves.""

The landscape now

Numbers about the foreclosure crisis show things have improved only slightly.

According to RealtyTrac, a website that collects and tracks foreclosure data, about 150,000 new foreclosure suits were filed nationwide in January 2009, the month Obama took office. They peaked at 203,948 in April 2009 and didn’t dip below 100,000 in a single month until April 2011. And last month, another 97,000 new foreclosures were filed.

Crossroads cites the high rate of underwater mortgages as evidence that Obama’s programs failed. In early 2008, the number of underwater homes was estimated at 9 million. RealtyTrac says the current total is 12 million, or 28 percent of all mortgages.

But that statistic, sobering as it is, offers a poor gauge of Obama’s policies. Borrowers ended up in this situation because they took out high-priced mortgages and then their property values plummeted -- a market occurrence largely outside any president’s control.

""It mostly reflects bad policy leading up to the crash,"" said Schwartz. ""Policies that encouraged reckless mortgage underwriting, which inflated prices.""

Still, there are some signs of progress.

Early this year, changes to HARP relaxed eligibility standards and extended the length of the program to the end of 2013. HAMP also was extended through next year. Schwartz said the programs were originally geared to subprime, high-risk mortgages. So as the recession worsened and people with more conventional mortgages lost jobs and income, the programs didn’t accommodate them. The new standards attempt to reach a bigger pool of homeowners, including people deeper underwater and those still in good standing on their loans.

The Treasury Department recently announced that the number of active permanent mortgage loan modifications agreed to by banks rose 12,139 to 794,748 during March, the most recent timeframe available. The Obama campaign cited HUD data showing that HAMP has trimmed a median of $535 off monthly payments of mortgages that have been modified as evidence of progress.

""I still think it’s meaningful and it’s helpful,"" Zandi said. ""It’s just not as helpful as they had hoped for.""

It’s also worth noting that there were forces working against Obama amid these efforts. The Republican-controlled House, for one.

""The Obama administration has been completely hamstrung by Congress, refusing to spend any money on stimulus,"" Schwartz said.

The economy, for another.

""They (the foreclosure programs) haven’t been as effective as hoped and the reason is because a lot of the foreclosures were triggered by the 8 million-plus loss in jobs,"" said Norm Miller, an economist, financial analyst and professor at the University of San Diego.

Our ruling

The Crossroads GPS ad said Obama has broken his promise to help millions of people facing foreclosure. ""Help"" is a vague notion, and there’s certainly no doubt that the president has tried several avenues to stem the tide of home loan defaults. But there’s also no doubt that his efforts have fallen far short of expectations -- and even the benchmarks he set for himself.

Two primary programs aimed at helping people keep their homes -- HAMP and HARP -- have reached more households in recent months, but they are unlikely to ever help the 9 million homeowners Obama said he would assist. And it’s reasonable that he could have leaned harder on lenders to produce better results in the aftermath of multi-billion-dollar bank bailouts.

Although Obama’s efforts haven’t been the utter failure Crossroads suggests, there are still millions of struggling homeowners who need help in the ongoing foreclosure crisis. We rate the ad’s claim Mostly True.

Sylvia Romo says Lloyd Doggett made millions off companies like Bank of America while they took taxpayer bailout money
","
U.S. House candidate Sylvia Romo depicts Lloyd Doggett, the Austin congressman facing Romo and Maria Luisa Alvarado in the Democratic primary, as a cane-carrying ""Lloydopoly"" (as in Monopoly) character in a mailer brought to our attention by a San Marcos reader.

The mailer from Romo, the Bexar County tax assessor-collector, says: ""While in Congress, Lloyd Doggett made millions. He made millions off companies like Bank of America while they took taxpayer bailout money and foreclosed on our homes.""

Doggett, initially elected to the House in 1994, had a net worth of as much as $8.3 million in 2010, according to a look by the Center for Responsive Politics at the personal financial statement he filed for that year.

We are focusing this review on Romo’s statement that Doggett made millions off companies like Bank of America while they fielded bailout money.

After asking her campaign for backup, we checked news accounts about Bank of America and the bailout.

Bank of America received $45 billion in aid through the federal Troubled Asset Relief Program set up in the wake of the 2008 banking panic, according to a Dec. 3, 2009, New York Times news article, though the story said it had just announced it would repay the money.

That evidently occurred. A Jan. 26, 2012, news article by the Associated Press says the government by then had unwound its investments in four of the companies that received the most bailout aid: Bank of America Corp., Citigroup Inc., Chrysler Group LLC and Chrysler Financial, the automobile maker's old lending arm.

Yet, the AP story says, a report by a special inspector general indicated American taxpayers were still owed about $133 billion that companies had not repaid from $413.4 billion paid out in the bailout program. The story says the gyrating stock market had slowed Treasury Department efforts to sell off stakes in 458 bailed-out companies, including insurer American International Group Inc., General Motors Co. and Ally Financial Inc.

We asked Doggett’s campaign if he’d profited from Bank of America holdings. His spokeswoman, Ashley Bliss-Herrera, pointed out Doggett's personal financial disclosure statements for 2008 and 2009, the years of the bailout. Those filings, posted online by the Center for Responsive Politics, require lawmakers to report assets and liabilities within broad dollar ranges. Doggett’s filings indicate that in 2008 and in 2009, Doggett had $1,001 to $15,000 invested in Bank of America. He received dividends of $1,001 to $2,500 in 2008 and of up to $200 in 2009, his report says. In 2010, the year of Doggett’s most recently filed report, he had $1,001 to $15,000 invested in Bank of America and up to $200 in related dividends. That year, he  had greater amounts invested in more than 60 other entities.

Next, again based on his financial disclosure filings, we looked into whether Doggett bagged millions from investments in other major bailout beneficiaries. The investments we spotted, counting the proceeds from his Bank of America holdings, appear to have generated about $16,000 for him from 2008 through 2010.

Some details:

--In 2008, Doggett received dividends of up to $1,000 from his investment of up to $15,000 in Citigroup, which fielded $50 million in bailout money, according to the New York Times. In 2009, Doggett reported Citigroup dividends of up to $200.

--Also in 2008, Doggett reported dividends of up to $5,000 from his investment of up to $100,000 in JP Morgan Chase, another bailout beneficiary. In 2009, dividends from that investment totaled up to $2,500, he reported, and in 2010, the dividends amounted to up to $1,000.

--Also in 2008, Doggett reported earning up to $2,500 in dividends on up to $15,000 invested in Wachovia, which became Wells Fargo, another bailout beneficiary. In 2009 and 2010, Doggett had up to $200 in dividends on the Wells Fargo investments.

About $16,000 in gains is far short of millions.

As we mulled this, Romo’s campaign consultant, Vince Leibowitz, emailed us a memo stating Romo’s claim is based on Doggett’s financial disclosure statements covering his first 16 years in Congress, including the recent bailout period. The filings show, Leibowitz said, that Doggett reaped millions of dollars over his House career from direct and indirect investments, through mutual funds and other investment devices, in banks and financial services firms including Bank of America.

That may be. Then again, Romo’s mailer says Doggett made millions off companies like Bank of America ""while"" those companies took the bailout aid. Why consider Doggett’s investment earnings over his House career?

Leibowitz replied by email: ""I'm afraid that we may have to discuss the proper usage of ‘while,’ as that may be what is causing the confusion. ‘While’ is not only a subordinating conjunction, but one that may be used in the contrastive sense. For example, ‘I like to read the"" Austin American-Statesman ""print edition while my fiancee prefers the Washington Post online.’ He said Romo used ""while"" in her mailer in the contrastive sense (like the word ""whereas""), not to necessarily indicate that Doggett made millions at the same time companies were taking the bailout money.

Regardless, Leibowitz said, Doggett also reaped millions starting in 2008, noting a list compiled by Roll Call, a Capitol Hill newspaper, placing Doggett among the richest members of Congress. The listing states Doggett’s reported assets for 2010 at $8.8 million against $250,000 in liabilities; the article says Doggett’s net worth increased 6 percent from 2009 to 2010..

From 2008 to 2010, according to research by the Center for Responsive Politics, Doggett’s net worth increased from up to $19 million to nearly $22 million or, at the low end, from $6.9 million to $8.3 million.

The Romo campaign’s memo on her claim says that Doggett’s net worth, per his financial disclosure filings, more than doubled from as much as $9.2 million when Doggett joined the House in 1995 to as much as $21.7 million in 2010.

Leibowitz, referencing Doggett’s financial disclosure filings, noted that Doggett has long reported holdings in a dozen banks and financial services companies. Also, Leibowitz said, Doggett has invested in multiple mutual funds and exchange-traded funds. ""A number of those are heavily invested in the financial services industry, meaning that money Doggett invests in these mutual funds and (ETFs) in turn is essentially invested on a pro-rata basis in the same companies,"" Leibowitz said. He listed nine 2010 Doggett investments in funds and each one’s related stakes in the financial services sector -- of up to 31 percent.

Leibowitz said Romo considers all companies in the financial services sector to be ""like Bank of America,"" a reference to her mailer’s message. Ultimately, Leibowitz said, Doggett made millions from his investments in individual financial service sector stocks and off investments in mutual funds and ETFs ""heavily invested"" in the financial services sector.

In her mailer, Romo says Doggett ""made millions off companies like Bank of America while they took taxpayer bailout money.""

We think it’s most reasonable to read Romo’s ""while"" as meaning Doggett made the millions at the same time companies took the bailout aid. That in mind, Doggett’s overall net worth may have climbed by several million dollars during the bank bailout years, though his earnings directly from stock in Bank of America and companies that fielded bailout money appears to have been less than $20,000 in those years.

By tying Doggett’s increase in net worth directly to bailed-out banks, Romo’s statement conflates and inflates. We rate it Mostly False.",/factchecks/2012/may/25/sylvia-romo/sylvia-romo-says-lloyd-doggett-made-millions-compa/
"['New Jersey', 'Taxes', 'Chris Christie']","
Chris Christie claims Democrats “don't want to cut your taxes under any circumstances”
","
Sometimes Gov. Chris Christie’s comments simply don’t jibe with reality.

Take, for instance, his claim at a transportation conference Wednesday that Democrats are opposed to any tax cuts this year.

As Christie continues pushing for an income tax cut, the Republican governor and Democratic legislators have been battling this week over differing state revenue projections.

The Christie administration is estimating a shortfall of $676 million through the end of the next fiscal year, while David Rosen, the budget and finance officer for the nonpartisan Office of Legislative Services, has estimated a shortfall of $1.3 billion.

After blasting Rosen as the ""Dr. Kevorkian of the numbers,"" Christie in a speech Wednesday claimed that Democratic legislators ""don't want to cut your taxes under any circumstances.""

""This year, when they don’t want to cut your taxes under any circumstances, they have their handmaiden walk over across the street in front of the Assembly Budget Committee today and say...’I was wrong. I was $1.6 billion wrong for this year, but trust me for next year. You’re another $660 billion short for next year.’ Why would anybody with a functioning brain believe this guy?""

Well, PolitiFact New Jersey has a question of its own: Why would anybody with a functioning brain believe Democrats don’t want tax cuts when they released their own tax cut proposals a few months ago?

The debate over their proposals and the governor's has gripped Trenton since Christie’s State of the State address in January, when the governor unveiled his plan for an across-the-board 10 percent cut in the state income tax. Democrats immediately pounced on the proposal for disproportionately benefiting the wealthiest residents.

But in early March, Democrats in the State Senate and the State Assembly each laid out their own tax cut proposals. After pointing out the Senate Democrats’ plan during a town hall meeting in March, Christie offered this promise:

""Looks like we got some place to work here. Here’s the one thing I know for sure: You’re gonna get tax relief in 2012, because we’re now agreeing on cutting taxes in Trenton.""

Both Democratic proposals only would benefit households earning up to $250,000 by providing a tax credit based on their property taxes. The tax credits would be applied against their income taxes.

Senate Democrats have proposed a 10 percent tax credit, while Assembly Democrats are pushing what they refer to as a 20 percent credit. According to Assembly Democrats, seniors and the disabled would receive a 25 percent credit. Unlike the Senate plan, the Assembly proposal includes increasing taxes on income exceeding $1 million.

Despite the poor revenue projections, Senate President Stephen Sweeney has stood by the need to provide property tax relief, according to published reports. Citing recent revenue projections, Assembly Democrats have criticized Christie's tax cut proposal, claiming their plan is the better solution. 
According to the Associated Press, one Assembly Democratic leader has left open the possibility that there may be no tax cut at all in the upcoming state budget.

In response to our findings, Christie spokesman Kevin Roberts provided this statement:

""Assembly Democrats specifically put forward a tax plan that raises taxes on some people. Theirs can be defined as much as a ‘tax cut’ as by a ‘tax increase.’ You guys are extraordinarily rigid on the use of language so I hope you make that note. Secondly, the Assembly plan is dead on arrival. It has zero chance of becoming law, which they know. Now, since the April revenue figures came out, Democrats have used those figures as an excuse to abandon a tax cut. Their statements indicate as much and we put out a release earlier today highlighting this fact.""

Our ruling

In a speech Wednesday, Christie claimed that Democratic legislators this year ""don't want to cut your taxes under any circumstances.""

That claim is pure nonsense. The main topic in Trenton has been competing tax cut proposals made by Christie and the Democrats. Christie may disagree with them on how to cut taxes, but there’s no doubt that many Democrats are willing to do just that.

For Christie to suggest otherwise is just ridiculous. Pants on Fire!

Corey Stewart says Prince William County cut violent crime in half since starting crackdown on illegal immigrants
","
In announcing his candidacy for lieutenant governor, Corey Stewart touted his record of combating crime and illegal immigrants during his years as chairman of the Prince William County Board of Supervisors.

""We have cut violent crime in half since we instituted what is probably the nation’s toughest crackdown on illegal immigration,"" Stewart, a Republican, said in an April 11 interview on NBC 12.

Stewart was referring to a law passed by the Prince William County Board of Supervisors in October 2007. The law initially required county police to determine the immigration status of anyone detained if there was probable cause to suspect the person was not a legal U.S. resident. The policy went into effect in March 2008.

Because of concerns officers would be accused of racial profiling, the board amended the law in April 2008 to require that police investigate the immigration status of everyone arrested for violating state or local laws.

We checked to see if violent crime has in fact dropped by half in Prince William since the county started the crackdown and, if so, whether the immigration law caused the decline.

The answers, we learned during many hours of research, are complex and often contradictory.

Statistical issues

Stewart’s campaign told us the candidate’s claim is based on statistics kept by the Prince William County Police Department.  Annual reports compiled by the local police show 767 violent crimes -- which they define as murder, rape, robbery and aggravated assault -- reported to the department in 2006 compared with 402 in 2011. That’s a drop of 47.6 percent.

But numbers in the Virginia State Police’s annual Crime in Virginia report show Prince William has experienced a much more modest decrease in violent crime between those years.

The State Police reports -- which define violent crime as murder, robbery, aggravated assault, forcible rape and ""other forcible sex crimes"" -- show only a 24 percent decline in the number of violent crimes between those years. That’s barely above the 22 percent drop off in violent crime experienced throughout Virginia from 2006 to 2011, according to State Police reports.

On the other hand, Prince William significantly topped the combined performance of its neighboring counties -- Fauquier, Loudoun, Stafford and Fairfax -- which saw a 27 percent increase in violent crime between 2006 and 2011.

For additional insight, we turned to the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Its statistics show the number of violent crimes reported by the Prince William County Police Department dropped 23 percent from 2006 to 2010, the latest year available. That’s slightly above the 21 percent drop across Virginia, according to FBI data. Prince William’s annual crime reports, meanwhile, show a 33.4 percent drop in violent crime during that time frame.

Why are the numbers so different?

Jonathan Perok, a spokesman for the Prince William police, said the county uses two different methods for recording crimes -- an old summary system for compiling its annual county reports and an incident-based system it uses when reporting its data to the state police.

Under the county’s system, the most serious offense in a criminal incident is counted. For example, in an incident involving a murder and a robbery, only the murder would be tallied.

But the county reports a different set of statistics to the State Police, who count all offenses in an incident when compiling their annual crime reports.

Adding to the confusion, the data sent to the state is in turn given to the FBI, which converts it back to the old summary data for its national report. Perok said the FBI’s converted numbers never match Prince William’s original statistics.

The old summary system on which Prince William bases its reports has been used nationwide since the 1930s, according to the FBI. But law enforcement agencies have been switching to incident-based reporting, which offers more details.

Our confusion over the statistics was shared by the co-authors of a 2010 study, sponsored by the University of Virginia, examining the impact Prince William’s crackdown on immigrants had on its crime rate.

""We ran into a very similar situation that was driving me absolutely crazy because we were coming up with completely different trends for similar time periods,"" said Tim Carter, a report co-author and the head of James Madison University’s sociology department.

The authors noted the problem in their study, and ultimately relied on Prince William’s police reports for much of their research.

Norman Westerberg, program manager with the Virginia State Police, was puzzled about why Prince William would use old summary reporting to tally crimes for its annual reports. He said the incident based format is more comprehensive.

But Dana Schrad, executive director of the Virginia Association of Chiefs of Police, said other local agencies throughout the commonwealth still use the old summary reporting system. She said keeping data in the old format allows for historic comparisons with crime data from earlier years. Some police officials think the older system provides a more accurate view of crime in their communities, she added.

When to start counting 

We encountered another statistical problem with Stewart’s statement. He said there has been a 50 percent drop in violent crime since the policy was ""instituted,"" meaning started. The law, as we’ve noted, didn’t pass until October 2007 and didn’t go into effect until March 2008.

Stewart gets near his 50 percent claim by using 2006 county police statistics as his base year to start measuring the decrease in violent crime.

But that’s more than year before the law was ""instituted.""

If we use 2007 as the starting point, the violent crime drop was 35 percent between that year and 2011, according to the county’s annual reports. State Police reports show violent crime in Prince William decreased by 2 percent during that time. Violent crime in Virginia went down 21 percent during that span.

The Stewart campaign says 2006 is a legitimate starting point because it was the last full year before the crackdown came up for consideration. Public debate over the measure began in mid-2007, they said, beginning the drop in violent crime.

Cause and effect

Next we turn to the implication of Stewart’s statement -- that the immigration law caused the decrease in violent crime.

The UVA study, which the Stewart campaign urged us to read, offers no definite answer to this part of the claim.

The report said violent crime in the county rose from 2004 to 2006 and then fell during 2007 and 2008. The drop was largely due to a 36 percent decline in aggravated assaults.

The report said aggravated assaults really began falling in July 2007, when controversy over the proposed policy began to rise.

""It’s probable, but by no means certain, that the drop in aggravated assaults is attributable to the immigration policy that the county adopted,"" Tom Guterbock, one of the report’s authors, told us. ""It’s a very conspicuous drop … Other counties (in northern Virginia) didn’t see such a drop.""

But Guterbock, the director of the Center for Survey Research at UVA, said other report co-authors were ""less sure"" the law caused the decrease.

The report says, ""On balance, our conclusions about the policy’s impact on crime must be cautious due in large part to the lack of historical data on crimes committed by illegal immigrants.""

Until the law went into effect, Prince William did not tally figures for crimes in which the suspects were illegal immigrants. The report said illegal immigrants, since the crackdown began, have committed only a small to modest percentage of crimes in Prince William, including aggravated assaults.

The report raises other possible reasons for the drop in crime, particularly aggravated assaults. Immigrants may have become more fearful of reporting crimes once the law went into effect, according to the study.

Our ruling

Stewart’s said violent crime in Prince William County has been cut in half since the county ""instituted"" its 2008 crackdown on immigrants. The claim only comes close to holding up when Stewart uses statistics kept by the county police and starts his count with crime data from 2006 -- more than a year before crackdown began.

Data from the state police -- which uses a more comprehensive formula than Prince William to count violent crime -- tells a different story. It shows only an 24 percent drop in Prince William from 2006 to 2011 just above Virginia’s average. FBI statistics, based on reports from the county’s police, show a 23 percent reduction in violent crime from 2006 to 2010, slightly above Virginia’s decline.

It’s important to note, however, that Prince William did outperform its neighboring Northern Virginia counties, which saw violent crime increase from 2006 to 2011, according to state police figures.

Stewart’s statement implies Prince William’s drop in violent crime was caused by the crackdown. Experts who studied the impact of the law came to no definitive conclusion on that point.

Group says Georgia transportation plan needs more rail
","
One main criticism about the proposed list of projects aimed at improving transportation throughout the Atlanta region is it doesn’t have enough new rail components.

In south DeKalb County, some county commissioners and influential leaders have been reluctant to support a 1 percent sales tax to fund the projects because the plan doesn’t extend MARTA rail service to the area.

The environmentally conscious Georgia Sierra Club went a step further recently when it announced its opposition to the July 31 referendum on the tax. One claim the organization’s director made as part of her argument against the referendum seemed worthy of a fact-check.

""For every one mile of light-rail track that will be built, 16 miles of new road capacity will be built,"" Colleen Kiernan said in a radio interview with WABE-FM’s Denis O’Hayer.

Hmmm. Is that correct? Let’s take a ride in search of the truth.

The list for the 10-county Atlanta region contains 157 projects, according to the Atlanta Regional Commission, which provided data and analysis to officials involved in putting together the list.

The Sierra Club sent PolitiFact Georgia a spreadsheet with about 70 projects that would increase the number of lanes of some roads or make them longer. Some of the road projects on the list include: 

The road projects would increase capacity by 367 miles, ARC says.

By comparison, there are three confirmed light-rail projects on the list: along the Atlanta Beltline, the Atlanta streetcar and a line on Clifton Corridor from the Lindbergh Center in Atlanta to Emory University in DeKalb County. A proposed rail line from Cobb County to Midtown Atlanta would need federal funding and is not currently considered a light-rail project.

The referendum’s supporters say the lack of light or heavy rail in the plan is not a lack of will, but a matter of math. The light rail on the Beltline and Clifton Corridor is expected to cost about $1.3 billion, or about $60 million a mile. The referendum is projected to raise about $8.5 billion over the life span of the tax, 10 years.

Jane Hayse, ARC’s transportation division chief, said the light-rail projects are 21 miles combined.

So what about the Sierra Club’s calculation of a 16-to-1 ratio of road projects to light rail? According to ARC, there are 17.5 miles of increased road capacity in the plan for each mile of proposed light rail.

""Mathematically, it is accurate,"" Hayse told us. ""However, the comparison is erroneous. It compares apples to bananas.""

Hayse said in order to fairly fact-check the Sierra Club’s claim, you must consider all the additional bus projects in the plan. The list includes express bus service in portions of the region and $100 million for bus service in Clayton County, which ended its bus operations a few years ago due to budget cuts. In all, ARC said there is an additional 371 miles of bus service on the list.

ARC spokesman Jim Jaquish said the organization will not take a position on the referendum because it is a nonprofit that receives taxpayer dollars. Jaquish did say ARC believes the list is made up of ""sound, needed projects.""

Hayse said express bus service is more logical for some parts of the Atlanta suburbs because people do not live and work as closely together as they do in the city. Hayse said rail stations are typically three miles apart, whereas express bus service has longer distances between stops.

""Light rail just doesn’t make sense for the whole region,"" she said.

Kiernan countered that bus service is not a sure thing, noting that Clayton County’s bus service, C-Tran, was discontinued.

""Our argument is that the amount of fixed, permanent transit infrastructure that we know will be built by the tax is overwhelmed by the amount of fixed road infrastructure we know will be built,"" Kiernan wrote via email. ""Traditional express and local bus service is a completely different animal ... and the suggestion that ‘miles of bus service’ is somehow equivalent to miles of permanent fixed-guideway infrastructure is highly misleading.""

Kiernan’s claim is essentially correct. But it needs a bit of context to move higher on the Truth-O-Meter.

Tennessee Democrats accuse freshman Congressman Stephen Fincher of breaking no-earmarks pledge
","Back when he was a candidate, U.S. Rep. Stephen Fincher signed a pledge that he would not ask for any federal earmarks, the special funding requests that lawmakers sometimes seek for pet projects like Alaska’s now-famous ""Bridge to Nowhere.""

But the Republican from Crockett County failed to live up to that promise once he got to Washington to represent Northwest Tennessee, according to the state’s Democratic party.

""Fincher Breaks Earmark Pledge"" proclaimed a headline on a recent blog post on the Tennessee Democratic Party’s web site.

""It seems like partisan posturing in 2010 has given way to the desire to curry favor with the special interests that are bankrolling his campaign,"" the Democrats concluded in their post on April 25, 2012.

We called the state party and asked them to back up the claim. Spokesman Brandon Puttbrese pointed us to a Gannett News Service article that documented the controversy over a tariff measure loaded with breaks for imports—breaks that critics say qualify as earmarks.

""We stand by what we wrote on the blog,"" Puttbrese said.

A little background is in order, courtesy of our colleagues at PolitiFact Florida, who recently looked into a similar claim the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee made against U.S. Rep. Allen West, R-Fla.

American companies import materials to make everything from umbrellas to medicine to pianos. The importers of these raw materials have to pay federal tariffs. And every year, hundreds of American companies, often with the help of lobbyists, ask members of Congress to suspend those tariffs. Supporters say waivers allow them to keep prices lower and employ more Americans.

Members introduce the requests as individual bills, which go through committees and then are vetted by the International Trade Commission and other agencies. The bill must meet certain criteria, including a limit on the loss of tariff revenue to under $500,000 per year. The trade commission posts the requests online, with explanations of the products that will benefit.

Members had until April 30, 2012, to submit requests. The bills probably won’t reach the chambers for votes until fall.

Fincher didn’t submit any requests for tariff breaks, his spokeswoman, Jennifer Cook, said in an email.

But he did sign an April 20 letter to House Speaker John Boehner calling for support of the ""miscellaneous tariff bill,"" which would reward the breaks. All told, 65 freshmen Republicans signed the letter. (Another Tennessee freshman, U.S. Rep. Chuck Fleischmann, R-Ooltewah, also signed the letter.)

Cook said Fincher signed the letter because duty suspension and reductions enacted in the 111th Congress are set to expire at the end of 2012. The duties will increase if legislation is not enacted to extend their current levels. That would add to the costs of importing raw materials, which would mean increased production costs and higher prices for American-made goods, which would result in the possible loss of manufacturing jobs, Cook said.

""Congressman Fincher believes in fostering an environment where manufacturers have access to the most inexpensive supplies available in order for U.S. manufacturers to be competitive on a global level,"" Cook said. ""By signing this letter and encouraging passage of the MTB, Congressman Fincher hopes manufacturers can be confident in the future of the price of imported goods and the rate at which they can create and market these goods.""

Fincher does not consider the tariff breaks earmarks, Cook said. ""Congressman Fincher believes that earmarks are direct congressional spending on a specific item in legislation, whereas a tariff is a tax break,"" she said.

Cook also pointed us to a myth vs. facts page distributed by the House Ways and Means Committee. In the fact sheet, Republicans argued that earmarks increase spending, but tariff bills reduce tariffs and are equivalent to a tax cut. They also said the tariff waivers could apply to any company and that the process is a ""model of transparency.""

Democrats beg to differ and are going after Republicans who signed the letter to Boehner.

Taxpayers for Common Sense, an independent group that monitors earmarking and other budget interests, also raised concerns about the tariff bills in an email to PolitiFact Florida, citing the ""potential pay-to-play and special interest giveaways that it perpetuates.""

But Steve Elllis, the group’s vice president, stopped short of calling the requests earmarks. Ellis said he needs to analyze this year’s list, but added he would not be surprised if some of the requests are earmarks.
 
Our ruling

The Tennessee Democratic Party claims Fincher’s decision to sign the letter voicing support for the ""miscellaneous tariff bill"" means he has reneged on his no-earmarks pledge.

But while tariff breaks do raise some of the same concerns as earmarks, they are different. Earmarks direct spending; tariff bills are more like tax breaks. More importantly, the process for tariff breaks is transparent and relatively easy to track, unlike the earmarks of previous years.

In recall battle, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker says new figures showing job gains are ""the final job numbers""
","
A day after Gov. Scott Walker announced statistics indicating Wisconsin had gained jobs in 2011 -- not lost them, as earlier numbers showed -- he touted the new figure in a TV ad, saying:

""The government just released the final job numbers. And, as it turns out, Wisconsin actually gained -- that's right, gained -- more than 20,000 new jobs during my first year in office.""

We’ve rated Mostly False Walker’s claim in the ad that 33,200 jobs have been added during his watch when you add the new 2011 figure to monthly numbers for 2012. While both sets of numbers are the most up to date, they are gathered differently and cannot be added in this manner, and they were presented without critical facts.

We’ve also rated False a claim by Democrat Tom Barrett -- Walker’s challenger in the June 5, 2012 recall election -- that Walker was ""cooking the books"" and had ""dreamed up"" the 20,000 figure. It’s a real number the state submitted to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics.

But there is another question tied in to both statements: Are the 2011 figures Walker announced three weeks before the election ""the final job numbers"" as he said in the ad?

His claim suggests, despite the controversy that ensued after his announcement, that the new figure has been reviewed by the federal government and is complete.

The 20,000 figure -- a precise figure of 23,321 appears on the screen in the ad -- comes from a quarterly jobs count involving about 95 percent of Wisconsin employers done by the state.  

The day Walker announced the figure the state reported job numbers for the final quarter of the year to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, which is the official jobs scorekeeper.

But just submitting the count does not make it final.

BLS will review the quarterly count and possibly adjust it before releasing a figure in late June 2012, some three weeks after the recall election.

That’s when an official jobs lost or added figure for 2011 will be, well, official.

Walker himself has acknowledged it’s unusual for a state to release its quarterly job count before BLS does it officially, although BLS has said states are free to do so.

Walker didn’t respond to our request for comment on his claim. But his own Department of Workforce Development, which submits the jobs data to BLS, notes that BLS won’t issue an official figure for 2011 until the end of June.

Wisconsin recall challenger Tom Barrett accuses Scott Walker of ""cooking the books"" on jobs figures
","
Gov. Scott Walker rocked the recall campaign when he announced that Wisconsin didn’t lose 33,900 jobs during his first year in office -- as had been widely reported -- it actually gained 23,321 jobs.

Democratic challenger Tom Barrett fired back hard.

In a May 17, 2012 interview on MSNBC-TV’s ""The Ed Show,"" the Milwaukee mayor told host Ed Schultz:  

""He's cooking the books, Ed. There's no question that these are figures that he just dreamed up 30 days before the election.""

(Barrett also released a TV ad three days later, saying Walker is ""playing tricks"" with the new jobs numbers because ""he didn’t like the real ones."")

So what’s Barrett’s evidence that Walker is ""cooking the books"" with numbers ""he just dreamed up""?

Barrett campaign spokesman Phil Walzak made two points:

1. The jobs-increase figure Walker released to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel on May 15, 2012 -- based on actual job counts from 95 percent of Wisconsin employers -- normally is submitted to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, reviewed and then released by the federal agency.

""Basically, these numbers are unverified,"" Walzak said.

The Journal Sentinel has reported extensively on Walker’s release of the jobs numbers.

It is highly unusual for a state, rather than the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, to release the jobs count. A BLS official told the newspaper the count, done quarterly, rarely changes much after the BLS review. But Abdur Chowdhury, chairman of the Marquette University economics department, told PolitiFact Wisconsin that ""sometimes the mistakes are very small, sometimes they are very large."" At the same time, Chowdury agreed with other economists that the quarterly job counts, once they’re released by BLS, are the best means of job-counting available.

So, while the figure Walker released has not yet been verified, it is not one that was ""dreamed up."" The figure is derived from an extensive job count by the state that is regularly reported to the federal government.

2. Given that the BLS isn’t scheduled to officially release the jobs count until three weeks after the recall election, Walker’s release of it three weeks before the election ""raises some serious questions,"" Walzak said.

He noted that the Journal Sentinel reported that never had there been such a large difference between the previously reported figure -- Wisconsin losing 23,321 jobs in 2011 -- and Walker’s claim of 33,900 jobs gained.

However, the two job measures vary considerably in reliability.

The jobs figure released by Walker is based on the actual quarterly job counts; the previously reported jobs-lost figure is an estimate based on monthly surveys of about 3.5 percent to 5 percent of Wisconsin employers. Moreover, according to BLS, the monthly net change in jobs in the survey can be off by 9,340 jobs in either direction.

So, although the timing of Walker’s release was to his political advantage, the figure he released is a more reliable source of employment data, state officials and many economists told the Journal Sentinel. In fact, the federal government ultimately uses the quarterly counts to revise the monthly jobs estimates.

Our rating

Barrett said Walker is ""cooking the books"" by releasing 2011 jobs data ""he just dreamed up.""

The figures Walker released haven’t yet been verified by the federal government. But they are based on job counts done quarterly by the state that involve about 95 percent of Wisconsin employers. And Barrett provided no evidence that the number Walker submitted was somehow manipulated.

Gov. Walker says Wisconsin has added 33,200 jobs since he became governor
","
With less than two weeks to go until the June 5, 2012, recall election pitting Gov. Scott Walker against Democratic challenger Tom Barrett, the top issues can be summed up this way:

Jobs, jobs, jobs.

And: jobs.

Nowhere is this more clear than in a television ad from Walker that is built on new jobs numbers for 2011 that show a brighter picture than previous numbers -- including much-cited monthly tallies by the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, the nation’s official scorekeeper on jobs.

In the ad, which began running May 16, 2012, Walker leans into the camera and tells viewers what they have heard about jobs going down is wrong.

""The government just released the final job numbers,"" he says, ""and as it turns out Wisconsin actually gained -- that’s right, gained -- more than 20,000 new jobs during my first year in office.""

He goes on:  ""Add the jobs created this year, and the total grows to over 30,000.""

There has been a blitz of job-related claims and counter-claims. We have already done items on several to help sort out the various aspects of what is being said. In this item, we are focusing on the claim Walker has made about how many jobs have been created.

Is he right?

One of our principles is that we rate statements based on the information available when they are made. For instance, when Barrett blamed Walker for worst-in-the-nation job losses from March 2011 to March 2012, we noted he was correct based on the official numbers at the time, but wrong to pin the blame solely on Walker and his policies. We rated the claim Half True.

In the new Walker ad, two sets of words appear on the screen as the governor speaks.

One quotes from a Journal Sentinel article and reads: ""... a gain of 23,321 jobs between Dec. 2010 and Dec. 2011 ...""

A second slide says ""33,200 total new jobs.""

This is the figure Walker settles on and what we’re examining.

How did Walker arrive at the numbers?

Walker begins with the new numbers his administration submitted to the federal government May 16, 2012, the day the ad began. They are based on a required quarterly census of state employers. Walker compares the December 2011 numbers to the December 2010 numbers, to get 23,321.

This is the same number included in the Journal Sentinel article the TV ad cites, which is understandable: The administration provided them to a reporter May 15, 2012, the day before it announced the census numbers that had been sent to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Walker then takes monthly numbers from the start of 2012, about 10,000, adds them to the  numbers from 2011 and arrives at the 33,200 figure.

Simple, right?

Not really.

The 2011 numbers are based on the jobs census, which covers about 95 percent of employers. They are deemed more accurate than the monthly numbers, which are based on a survey of sample of about 3.5% of employers, then extrapolated to get a state number.

At various times Walker has touted and criticized these monthly numbers, depending on whether they have shown an increase or a decrease. And these are the numbers Barrett and Democrats have cited to argue the state is losing jobs under Walker.

The BLS itself recognizes the census method as more accurate. Indeed, it uses those numbers to update the monthly numbers. Think of it as a picture that over time comes into sharper focus.

The problems:

-- The 2011 numbers are not final. They will be reviewed by the BLS and can change, though typically they do not change by a large amount.

The normal procedure is the state gathers the employment data from more than 90 percent of state businesses -- some 160,000 -- and then submits it to the feds for review, said Abdur Chowdhury, chairman of the Marquette University economics department.

""They vet the data and correct any mistakes in calculations,"" he said of the feds. ""Sometimes the mistakes are very small, sometimes they are very large.""

-- The two sets of numbers are collected differently.  If not an apples and oranges comparison, Walker is certainly mixing two different varieties of apples. They eventually will be combined by federal officials -- the census numbers will be the new basis for the monthly numbers as the ever-changing picture is updated. But this won’t happen for some time.

Of course, that’s not satisfying for Walker who wants to highlight the numbers -- or for voters who must factor in progress on jobs (Walker’s top 2010 campaign promise was to create 250,000 new private-sector jobs over four years) before the recall vote.

How do we evaluate them?

First, the numbers provide the best current estimate for 2011 and the most recent 2012 count, so they offer a sense of where things stand. While the 2011 numbers are not yet ""official,"" they are real numbers submitted by the state to the BLS. (We separately rated a claim by Barrett that the numbers were ""just dreamed up"" as False.)

Chowdhury said the numbers released by Walker should be considered ""raw data"" because they have not been reviewed by the BLS. They are not, he said, the ""final"" numbers for 2011 employment.

(We separately rated the claim in the ad by Walker that these were the ""final numbers"" as False.)

When we asked Walker’s campaign about the numbers, spokeswoman Ciara Matthews said, ""That’s the best data available to us.""

Barrett spokesman Phil Walzak noted the new 2011 numbers ""raised some serious questions"" because ""they can't be verified and they won't be verified until after the election.""

He also noted that the Journal Sentinel story about them said never has there been such a large swing -- 57,000 -- between earlier numbers showing job losses and Walker's new numbers showing job gains.

Are the April numbers included?

The Walker campaign did not respond to efforts to clarify which set of numbers for 2012 were used.

That is, was it the numbers for the first three months -- January, February, March? These were the latest released at the time the ad debuted, on May 16, 2012. Or the first four months,  including April? Those monthly numbers were announced by the BLS the next day.

When Matthews stopped responding to our questions on this point, we tried numerous ways to get the 2011 and 2012 numbers to add up as they do in the ad.

The approach that came closest to the number used in the ad was using the January to April monthly numbers for public- and private-sector jobs. When added to the 2011 number, which also was for all jobs,  it  would mean an increase since he took office of 33,421.

That compares with the 33,200 used.

The April numbers actually showed a drop from March. Had the March numbers been used, the total cited in the ad could have been higher, about 39,600.  

Finally, there is the question of how much Walker is crediting his own policies as leading to the new numbers. A governor -- like a mayor -- has little control over national economic trends such as a severe recession. And any policy changes implemented in response take time to be felt.

Thus, when we have evaluated similar claims in the past, the Truth-O-Meter winds up somewhere in the middle, often as Half True.

In the ad, Walker presents the numbers as just the guv sharing good news. It’s not a full-throated credit-me approach. But in highlighting his own success and urging viewers to continue his policies, implicit in the claim is a statement taking credit for the improving numbers.

What’s more, Walker has acknowledged the numbers were released in an unusual manner. Without the early release, they would not be out until well after the election. So, it is to his political benefit to release -- and tout -- them now.

Thus, that deserves a big asterisk any time the numbers are cited.

Indeed, the article the ad cites as support for the 2011 numbers includes all of these cautionary notes -- but in isolating a few words from the article the ad snips them out for more advantage.

Our rating

Walker’s ad says there are 33,200 more jobs in Wisconsin since he took office.

To reach the number, he combined two data sets -- one that involves unofficial (but generally more accurate) numbers that could change in the weeks after the election; the other is volatile, but still official monthly numbers. From an accounting standpoint this would be flagged as a mistake. From a political standpoint, he is mixing and matching to present the best possible view.

Walker presents it all as final and official, offering no cautionary notes or caveats -- even though there are many.

And Walker credits his policies for the improvement, which overstates the impact a governor can make on broad economic trends in a short period of time.

There is clearly some truth to the numbers. But in mixing everything together and not making it clear these numbers are preliminary, Walker ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.

American Future Fund says Wall Street ""supports President Obama"" and funds him like in 2008
","
President Barack Obama called out ""fat cat bankers on Wall Street,"" but those wealthy bankers sure help him out when he needs campaign donations, says an ad on the air in Florida dubbed ""Obama’s Wall Street."" It’s from the conservative organization American Future Fund.

Here’s the script:

Obama: ""I did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat cat bankers on Wall Street.""

Narrator: ""But guess who gave $42 million to Obama’s last campaign for president: Wall Street bankers and financial insiders, more than any other candidate in history. But Obama voted for the Wall Street bailout. His White House is full of Wall Street executives … ."" (The ad then shows photos and lists the names in the White House ""inner circle."")

The narrator continues: ""Now, Obama’s flush with cash, returning to Wall Street for even more money. Obama won’t admit to supporting Wall Street, but Wall Street sure supports President Obama.""

There are a lot of claims in that ad, and our friends at FactCheck.org have already picked apart the list of 27 officials the ad shows, and whether they really are White House inner circle folks and former Wall Street executives. Many of them aren’t. (FactCheck also wrote that the fund later tweaked the ad.)

For our fact-check, we will focus on whether ""Wall Street sure supports Obama."" The ad’s message is that the president is Wall Street’s favored candidate, and that he is cleaning up in Wall Street donations this cycle, just like he did in 2008.

The ad was launched in February, but we've seen it on television in Florida in May. A February press release from the fund stated the $4 million buy covered nine states, including Florida, Ohio and Virginia. We contacted the fund to ask if it had any additional citations beyond what was in the ad and did not get a response.

First, some background about the American Future Fund: It states on its website that it advocates ""conservative, free market ideals,"" and its president is an Iowa state senator. Many of the group’s ads target Obama. The New York Times reported that the group was started with seed money from an ethanol executive. The Center for Responsive Politics, which analyzes campaign donations, wrote in 2010 that the American Future Fund received about half of its $23 million from the Center to Protect Patients Rights, a group that gave donations to groups opposed to the federal health care law or abortion.

Obama’s vote as a senator and the 2008 campaign

The ad is correct when it states that while a senator Obama voted in favor of the Wall Street bailout (H.R. 1424) on Oct. 1, 2008. He was one of 74 senators, along with his Republican presidential opponent John McCain, to vote in favor.

The ad then cites fundraising data from the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonpartisan research group which analyzes campaign donations. We looked at CRP’s data ourselves for the 2008 and 2012 presidential races.

During the 2008 campaign, Obama raised about $42.8 million from the finance/insurance/real estate industry -- far above McCain’s haul of about $31.1 million. (FactCheck.org wrote that Obama’s haul was more than George W. Bush’s in 2004 even when adjusted for inflation.)

The center breaks down that finance/insurance/real estate industry into more detail, including securities and investment, which outreach coordinator Evan Mackinder said would be the most specific way to characterize Wall Street donations.

Obama raised about $16 million from the securities and investment industry, while McCain raised about $9.4 million. The ad cites the $42 million figure -- the larger and broader number -- rather than the more specific securities and investment number, but the ad can take some leeway on that point, because it described it as ""Wall Street and financial insiders."" 

After Obama became president and pushed for financial reform, his relationship with some in the finance sector soured. We found many news reports documenting that tension. Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican nominee, founded the investment firm Bain Capital and has had friendly relations with Wall Street and secured millions from those donors. Romney said he would repeal the Dodd-Frank regulations and has been vague about other reforms that he would enact to avoid the 2008 financial meltdown.

Obama and Romney donations in the 2012 race

Through April, Romney is in the lead in donations from finance/insurance/real estate and, within that, the securities and investment industry, according to a May analysis written by the Center for Responsive Politics.

Romney has raised about $19.2 million from the finance/insurance/real estate including about $8.5 million from the securities and investment industry, according to the center’s analysis.

Obama has raised about $8.4 million in the finance/insurance/real estate, including about $3 million from securities and investment.

That means Romney has raised between double and triple Obama’s haul from the securities and investment sector.

If we look at the donations proportionally, it would show that the securities sector funded about 3 percent of Obama’s haul and 10 percent of Romney’s. (This doesn’t provide a full picture since the center’s analysis is for donations that were more than $200 a pop -- in the case of Obama that means about $99 million of his $217 million is reflected in the analysis by industry.)

The analysis shows that the securities/investment industry is the second-largest source of donations for Romney, behind the ""retired"" category. It comes in fifth for Obama, behind retired, lawyers, education and business services.

The securities/investment donations are even more lopsided for the super PACs: the Restore Our Future pro-Romney PAC raised about about $21 million from that industry while the Priorities USA Action pro-Obama PAC raised about $218,500.

The center wrote in a March blog post that the ad uses its data to make a misleading point when it states that ""Wall Street sure supports President Obama"":

In a separate March 2012 article, the center stated that between his campaign committee and a PAC, Romney had received about 72 percent of the near $33 million in Wall Street donations through February.

""The sheer amount of cash Wall Street has sent Romney represents an extremely lopsided giving pattern. No other presidential candidate, including President Barack Obama, comes close to tapping the motherlode of industry riches. The industry's abandonment of Obama could hardly be more dramatic: Wall Street's preferred candidate in the 2008 race with more than $6 million in industry campaign contributions at this point in the cycle, he has received less than $2.6 million from the industry so far this time around.""

News articles cited in ad

The American Future Fund ad flashes headlines or information from a few news articles. But we found the ad cherry-picked a few of its sources.

• The ad shows a partial headline from an October 2011 Washington Post story: ""Obama still flush with cash from financial sector."" The rest of that headline, which was omitted from the ad, stated, ""despite frosty relations."" The article explains that Obama had raised more from the financial and banking sector than Romney but not when putting aside Democratic National Committee money.

• The ad cites the headline from a February 2012 Bloomberg article  ""Obama returns to NYC for Wall Street fundraiser."" That article includes this sentence: ""So far this election cycle, he hasn’t been able to match the success he had four years ago in getting money from Wall Street.""

Our ruling 
The American Future Fund’s ad says, ""Obama’s flush with cash, returning to Wall Street for even more money. … Wall Street sure supports President Obama.""

It is true that Obama has received millions of dollars from Wall Street this cycle. But the intention of the ad is to suggest that Obama is Wall Street’s preferred candidate, just like in 2008. In reality, the numbers don’t bare that out -- Romney is the preferred candidate, based on both campaign contributions and news coverage.

The fund’s ad relies on data from Center for Responsive Politics, but it uses the data in a misleading way. Whether we looked at the broader finance/insurance/real estate industry or the more narrow securities and investment sector, the Romney campaign is far ahead of the Obama campaign in dollars.

Barack Obama's 'Life of Julia' says Mitt Romney would replace Medicare with ‘nothing but a voucher’
","
CORRECTION: We first published this item on May 22, 2012, with a rating of False. But readers pointed out we had incorrectly said that the Wyden-Ryan and Romney plans for Medicare offered traditional fee-for-service Medicare alongside a premium-support or ""voucher"" system for purchasing private insurance. Instead, both plans offer traditional Medicare inside of a new premium-support system, as another plan that competes with private insurance. We corrected and updated our item, this time including the complete sentence from the campaign website. We reconsidered our original conclusion and have now rated the statement Mostly False.

""Julia,"" a character created by the Obama campaign, would be better off under President Barack Obama because of Mitt Romney’s position on Medicare, the campaign says.

Its Web cartoon, ""The Life of Julia,"" compares the impact of the candidates' policies on Julia at a dozen points in her life. At age 65, here’s the contrast it draws between President Barack Obama and Romney: 
Under President Obama: Julia enrolls in Medicare, helping her to afford preventive care and the prescription drugs she needs. 
Under Mitt Romney: Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan. 
We wondered, under Romney’s policies, is it true that, ""Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan""?

Outdated analysis

The day the Julia graphic was published online, the Obama campaign released a memo explaining that the character would let voters compare the effect of Obama and Romney’s policies on a typical middle-class woman at each step in her life.

It provided more detail on the campaign’s claim that under Romney ""Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance"" — along with a source.

""He would end Medicare as we know it by replacing seniors’ guaranteed benefits with a voucher to buy insurance coverage — a plan similar to ones that the Congressional Budget Office found would raise seniors’ out-of-pocket health care spending by $6,350 a year,"" the memo said.

But reliance on that April 2011 CBO report is misleading for at least two reasons. It analyzes an out-of-date plan, and ignores that Romney has offered his own. We’ll look at both issues in turn.

Old plans, new plans

First, we should clarify that none of these GOP proposals suggest dramatic changes to Medicare for anyone who’s already 55 or older — so we’re assuming a world where Julia is young enough to be affected.

The ad bases its claim on a Medicare proposal from House budget chairman Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wis., put forward in early 2011. The Julia cartoon gets its number of $6,350 extra per year from an analysis of that plan, which had a tighter spending cap and didn’t include traditional Medicare as an option. Since then, Ryan has proposed a new Medicare plan, released in March 2012, which offers voucher-like credits for traditional fee-for-service Medicare, alongside private insurance options. (Those credits are sometimes referred to as ""premium support."")

Ryan’s new plan was based on yet another plan released in December 2011 in collaboration with Democratic Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon — which is the one we’ll focus on here. Why? Because Romney’s plan says that bipartisan plan ""almost precisely mirrors"" his.

(Wyden-Ryan and the new Ryan plan are substantially similar, with a few key differences; see a side-by-side comparison by the Kaiser Family Foundation.)

The Wyden-Ryan plan

Seniors already pay premiums for Medicare, notably the parts of Medicare that cover doctor visits and prescription drug coverage. Under Wyden-Ryan, seniors could use their premium support payments to help pay for traditional Medicare coverage. That coverage would be among the options on a new Medicare exchange, which would also include private plans that offered ""at least as comprehensive a benefit as traditional fee-for-service Medicare.""

Those plans wouldn’t necessarily supply the same menu of benefits, but benefits with the same dollar value, something called ""actuarial equivalence."" The Wyden-Ryan plan would peg the size of the payments to the second-lowest-cost plan on the exchange.

Whether seniors would have to pay more for choosing traditional Medicare would depend on how fee-for-service Medicare stacked up against private plans. If it were more expensive, seniors would pay more out of pocket to keep it. If it were cheaper, they would get money back.

(We should mention that lower-income beneficiaries would get more help than higher-income ones, not unlike Medicare’s current medical and drug insurance coverage.)

The requirement that private plans offer benefits of at least the same value as traditional Medicare offers more protection than ""nothing but a voucher"" suggests, says Gail Wilensky, a health economist who directed the Medicare and Medicaid programs from 1990 to 1992 under President George H.W. Bush.

She supports the push for private competition under Wyden-Ryan, arguing it could introduce innovation that boosts care and saves money.

But critics of the proposal, such as Henry Aaron of the Brookings Institution, say that the dollar-value requirement sets up a vicious cycle where plans compete to attract the lowest-risk patients, leaving a higher-risk group in traditional Medicare and driving up costs.

Wyden-Ryan attempts to tackle this problem by asking plans with a lower-risk pool to pay into a fund that subsidizes those for higher-risk patients.

Aaron says that such ""risk adjustment"" tools simply aren’t sophisticated enough.

""When you're confronted with a vague proposal to replace a vitally important institution, and the sponsors have not nailed down key elements of that proposal, it's fair for critics to worry that some problematic things will happen,"" Aaron said.

Another reason analysts fear that premium-support payments under Wyden-Ryan would leave seniors on the hook for rising health care costs is that the plan includes a spending cap if competition among private plans and traditional Medicare doesn’t keep costs in check.

Starting in 2022 — the same time people would start to be eligible to buy coverage from the new Medicare exchange — there would be a cap on Medicare cost growth of 1 percent over the country’s gross domestic product, plus inflation. But the Wyden-Ryan plan — unlike the later Ryan plan — says the government would get savings from providers, drug companies and means-tested premiums, not necessarily by shifting costs to beneficiaries by chopping premium-support payments.

That spending cap is similar to the one supported by Obama, but they have different ways to achieve it. The president would merely set the cap as a target, then primarily rely on changes to provider payments recommended by the Independent Payment Advisory Board, which was created by the Affordable Care Act.

The Romney plan

Meanwhile, the graphic ignores that Romney has his own Medicare plan. While Romney’s proposal in its own words ""almost precisely mirrors"" the Wyden-Ryan plan, Romney’s plan is even less specific. Romney doesn’t specify the size of premium support payments to seniors, nor how quickly those payments will grow over time.

Instead, a question-and-answer section merely says that, ""he is exploring different options for ensuring that future seniors receive the premium support they need while also ensuring that competitive pressures encourage providers to improve quality and control cost. His goal is for Medicare to offer every senior affordable options that provide coverage and service at least as good as what today’s seniors receive."" That simply doesn’t support the kinds of specific claims the Obama camp makes about Romney’s policy proposal.

One thing Romney’s plan does clearly say: ""Traditional Medicare will compete against private plans."" Just as with the Wyden-Ryan plan, that may be via a premium-support system. But that doesn’t mean it’ll necessarily leave Julia on the hook for extra payments as the Obama campaign’s graphic suggests.

Our ruling

The Obama campaign’s ""Life of Julia"" graphic says that under Romney, ""Medicare could end as we know it, leaving Julia with nothing but a voucher to buy insurance, which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan.""

But the bipartisan plan Romney supports includes traditional Medicare among seniors’ options for purchase on a Medicare exchange. It also requires other plans to offer benefits of at least the same value. Finally, it includes a more generous cap on spending growth than the original Ryan plan. If all plans rose in cost, hitting a proposed spending cap, the bipartisan plan says the government would turn to providers and other sources of savings. 
Meanwhile, Romney’s plan simply isn’t specific enough to justify the statement, ""which means $6,350 extra per year for a similar plan"" — a number based on analysis of the original Ryan plan.

The Obama campaign ties Romney to an outdated plan with less generous spending growth and no traditional Medicare option. Romney does support a voucher-like system, but the graphic ignores critical facts that would give a different impression about his plan.

"['Immigration', 'Texas', 'Ryan Downton']","
Ryan Downton says Paul Workman offered legislation providing amnesty for illegal immigrants
","Ryan Downton of Austin, challenging Austin state Rep. Paul Workman in the 2012 Republican primary, maintains that Workman last year proposed Texas-style amnesty for illegal immigrants.

In a May 21, 2012, open letter posted on his campaign website, Downton -- who earlier urged us to look at this issue -- says Workman, who seeks a second two-year term, has deliberately not told voters about the proposal. ""In short, he wants to pretend the bill doesn’t exist,"" Downton writes. ""I can understand why he doesn't want you to know about"" House Bill 2886 ""because it... provides amnesty to illegal immigrants... provides driver's licenses to illegal immigrants... forbids employers from discrimination against illegal immigrants; and would make Texas a ‘sanctuary state’ where law enforcement personnel couldn't enforce federal immigration law.""

That covers a lot of turf. In this article, we’ll gauge Downton’s main claim that Workman’s proposal provided amnesty, which in connection with immigration can be a politically radioactive term.

As PolitiFact in Washington noted in a December 2, 2011, article, Merriam Webster defines amnesty as ""the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals."" With respect to illegal immigrants, the historical standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, which was signed into law by President Ronald Reagan. That law enabled illegal residents to become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in the United States by Jan. 1, 1982, and met other minimal requirements. It was widely described as an ""amnesty"" program.

Then again, the definition of amnesty can vary based on one’s attitude toward immigration policies. Advocates for more legal immigration often maintain that amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria. Those who oppose more immigration define amnesty more broadly. Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, previously told PolitiFact: ""Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty.""

By email and in a telephone interview, Downton said that Workman’s proposal would have forgiven foreign nationals in the United States illegally who qualified for state-issued cards permitting them to work in Texas. Also, he said, the Workman proposal included elements mirroring provisions in the 1986 federal immigration act. Downton said by email: ""While it is not complete amnesty, because Texas does not have the power to invalidate federal immigration law, it is as much amnesty as the state of Texas can provide.""

We were ready to read the legislation, which the Austin American-Statesman referred to as a ""guest worker"" plan in a March 10, 2011, news article on Workman filing the proposal that day. According to legislative records, the measure was initially referred to the House Committee on State Affairs, which held an April 6, 2011, hearing on it.

Titled the Texas Immigrant Reconciliation Act, the proposal calls for providing a way to gather information on foreign nationals illegally in the state and to collect taxes to pay for services provided to such residents. The proposal also says it provides a ""legal method for a foreign national to work in this state; ensure that employers hire only legally eligible workers; and remove the incentive for human trafficking along the southern border.""

Under the proposal, undocumented immigrants could apply to the Texas Workforce Commission for a ""Texas resident alien card"" by paying $4,000 and submitting to a criminal history check. The card, valid for eight years, would enable the holder to work legally in the state; holders could subsequently apply for a new card. The proposal  also says the holder of a resident alien card is eligible for a driver’s license. Funding would come from a requirement that employers of illegal residents withhold from their paychecks a state tax at the rate of federal withholding.

The legislation says U.S. citizenship is not contemplated: ""An unlawful resident alien does not become a United States citizen because the person has been issued a resident alien card. A resident alien card does not create an advantage to the cardholder in obtaining citizenship.""

An employer hiring card-carrying immigrants would have an ""affirmative defense against any charge by the federal government for hiring an unlawful resident alien,"" the proposal says. In contrast, the measure says, an employer of a foreign national not lawfully present in Texas and not issued the state resident alien card is subject to a $10,000 fine for each incident.

Other provisions bar illegal immigrants from state-provided public health services, save emergency hospital care, as well as federal Social Security benefits. But, the proposal says, an employer must provide benefits to a card holder similar to benefits the employer provides to employees considered legal residents under federal law.

So, Workman authored a proposal making it possible for illegal immigrants to work legally in Texas for eight years at a clip.

Next, we listened to the House hearing on the proposal. Addressing the committee, Workman suggested the federal government had failed to enforce immigration laws and it was time for Texas to attempt his reform. ""Now those who believe that deportation is the only solution and see no middle ground will not be happy with this legislation,"" Workman said. ""But if I may quote an old passage of Scripture, ‘Come now and let us reason together.’""

Workman also said it would be impractical to deport an estimated 12 million illegal U.S. residents or some 1.5 million believed to be in Texas. ""Mass deportation will not happen,"" he said.

Workman did not refer to his proposal as amnesty; two opponents did. ""This is basically an amnesty bill for eight years,"" testified TJ Scott. David Carter, a member of the Immigration Reform Coalition of Texas, which urges close attention to illegal immigration, said: ""It’s amnesty for a fee; it’s amnesty, amnesty, amnesty.""

Workman, closing his presentation, said: ""I knew when I filed this bill it would be controversial. But I think that the state of Texas needs to engage in the debate about what do with the folks that are here in Texas illegally and contributing to our economy -- some would say taking away from our economy.""

The representative also said: ""What you heard over and over again is that we need to secure our border and enforce immigration laws, and that’s exactly what’s not happening. And in anybody’s estimation, it’s not going to happen.""

The committee left the proposal pending; there was no further action before the legislative session ended.

Workman's campaign, responding to our inquiry about Downton's claim, emailed a statement from Workman declaring his opposition to amnesty for illegal immigrants. His statement says his proposal had nothing to do with citizenship, a federal issue, and provided for fining employers who knowingly break the law by hiring illegal immigrants.

""The legislation was aimed at providing the state of Texas with an avenue to find out who is here illegally, if they have a criminal record and find out if they are paying taxes,"" Workman said. ""Monies paid by the illegal immigrants under the bill were to be used to enhance border security and help pay for social services illegal immigrants are now, otherwise, getting for free.""

Our ruling

Under Workman’s 2011 proposal, illegal residents paying a fee and clearing a background check could receive a state-issued card enabling them to work in Texas for eight years at a time.

That strikes us as a kind of forgiveness some would consider amnesty. However, the proposal does not go as far as the 1986 federal act, which enabled immigrants to become legal residents for all purposes, not just to work for a time period in one state. Significantly, that law put beneficiaries on paths to citizenship; Workman’s proposal would not.

In TV ad, Don Gaetz distorts debate over septic tank inspections
","
Florida’s next Senate president is telling voters in a new campaign ad that he fought to overturn a ""fast one"" pulled by Tallahassee lawmakers. 
""When Tallahassee pulled a fast one on septic tanks, Gaetz fought back,"" a TV advertisement says. 
That’s partially true.

But Sen. Don Gaetz, a loquacious Republican from the Panhandle, is leaving something out when he discusses a never-enforced and now largely repealed measure requiring septic tank inspections every five years.

He voted for the inspections. Twice.

In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Gaetz said he was misled about the inspection requirement by the Senate sponsor and a staff member, and that’s why he and other Republicans crusaded to have the inspection requirement tossed out of state law. But the public record doesn’t bear that out.

""This bill was not a last-minute, surprise bill,"" said Sen. Paula Dockery, R-Lakeland, a member of the special committee that raised the prospect of mandatory inspections with residents in 2010. ""I think that’s a little unfair -- a lot unfair.""

PolitiFact Florida decided to dig into the septic tank inspection requirement, which passed in 2010 and was removed for most counties in 2012.

Then-Sen. Lee Constantine, R-Altamonte Springs, sponsored the measure as part of a larger conservation proposal (SB 550). There are about 2.6 million septic tanks in Florida, and about half are more than 30 years old, a 2008 Department of Health study found. (The Legislature had directed the agency to assess the costs of a statewide inspection program.)

Officials expected the amount of annual septic tank inspections to increase from 17,000 to 500,000 because the of the new requirement.

Constantine’s bill passed its required committees with ease, earning just a few no votes. Gaetz, elected to the Senate in 2006, voted against the bill during one committee stop. But when it came before the full Senate for final passage, Gaetz, like nearly every senator, cast floor votes in favor on April 26, 2010 (30-3), and April 29, 2010 (34-4).

Most people who spoke at the committee’s statewide hearings before the session ""spoke highly of the idea"" of an inspection program, noted a 2010 summary of the committee’s work.

""Not one speaker spoke against requiring inspections,"" the report stated.

That changed almost immediately -- with Gaetz, other Republicans and at least one Democrat leading the backpedaling. They argued that the inspection requirement was a one-size-fits-all approach and that the price tag of inspections -- estimated around $150 or more -- was too high during an economic downturn. (PolitiFact Florida wrote about the cost issue during the 2011 session.)

As frustration mounted among tea party members and his northwest Florida constituents, Gaetz was quoted as saying a repeal of the inspection requirement was already ""teed up and and ready to go,"" according to November 2010 Bradenton Herald story.

In another statement, he bemoaned the legislation’s burden ""on many people in rural areas who are struggling to make it financially in these exceptionally hard times.""

Why the change of heart?

Gaetz told PolitiFact Florida he voted for the bill after being ""misled"" by Constantine and committee staff about the bill’s consequences -- hence the ""fast one.""

He asked Constantine privately outside the Senate chamber, he said, if this was the same proposal the Senate defeated the year before, and he said no (that proposal applied to some counties with larger springs and died in committee). Gaetz said he asked if he had anything to worry about, and Constantine told him no, it would affect areas Gaetz didn’t represent.

""Constantine and the staff director attempted to reassure me and other senators that our concerns were misplaced,"" he said. ""The whole Senate was operating under information that wasn’t entirely true.""

That’s why he crusaded against the inspections later, he said.

Constantine insists he never misrepresented the septic tank program.

""All the information was fully vested,"" Constantine said.

Audio recordings of meetings in which Gaetz voted on SB 550 amplify Constantine’s position.

The inspection requirement was added to the bill during the Senate Policy and Steering Committee on Ways and Means. Shortly before Gaetz’s no vote during that meeting, Sen. Joe Negron, R-Stuart, asked Constantine about the inspection program’s impact during a series of rapid-fire hypothetical questions.

""Is this statewide?"" Negron asked.

""Yes,"" Constantine said.

As the Senate approached its floor vote a few days later, Constantine fielded a question from Sen. Rudy Garcia, R-Hialeah: ""Is this the one that has the septic tank language?""

""This is the landmark bill for water resources and it includes that,"" Constantine said.

There were no questions from Gaetz.

Now, it’s true that Gaetz attempted to overturn the inspection requirement. During a special session in 2010, Gaetz sponsored a measure that pushed the program’s implementation date from Jan. 1, 2011, to July 1, 2011. Gov. Rick Scott allowed it to become law without his signature. (The Senate and the House waited until Scott was in office to deliver the bill to the governor for his signature or veto.)

In 2011, Gaetz said he asked Senate budget chairman JD Alexander, R-Lake Wales, to include budget language that would prevent the Department of Health from implementing the requirement for another year.

And in 2012, Gaetz said he asked Senate President Mike Haridopolos to find a way to get rid of the mandate. A partial repeal wound up in a Department of Health reorganization bill (HB 1263), which Scott signed into law. The inspection requirement still exists for 19 counties with large springs, but they are allowed to opt out of the inspection requirement (as Hernando County did in early May.)

In the end, Gaetz basically fought to get rid of a state law that he is partially responsible for. Gaetz says he was misled by ""a fast one,"" but we found no evidence of the bill sponsor downplaying the swath of affected homeowners. Plus Gaetz ultimately is responsible to know what is in a bill he voted on.

Williamson County DA John Bradley says challenger Duty has never prosecuted an adult felony case
","
In the heated contest over the Republican nomination to be Williamson County’s district attorney, incumbent John Bradley has repeatedly said challenger Jana Duty, the elected county attorney, doesn’t have enough experience to do his job. 
In an op-ed article published on the Austin American-Statesman’s website May 14, 2012, for instance, Bradley talked up his résumé and then said: ""Duty has never prosecuted a single adult felony case."" 
Not one? 
Before detailing our fact-check, we think it’s important to note that we’re not tackling what kind of experience a district attorney should have and whether Duty has it — that’s open to debate. 
We were curious whether Bradley was correct that Duty had never prosecuted an adult felony case. 
On its face, such a charge illuminates a basic difference between the jobs of the district attorney and county attorney in Williamson County. Criminal prosecution of adults is split between them, with the district attorney’s office handling felony cases and the county attorney’s office handling misdemeanors. 
So since Duty became county attorney in 2005, adult felonies have not fallen under her purview, which means she could not have personally prosecuted them. 
In a write-up he emailed to us, Bradley says previous experience with adult felony cases is key because ""no person can credibly or successfully lead an office without any experience or understanding of the job being done in that office."" Via email, Bradley also told us that the district attorney sets office-wide policy on punishment recommendations in plea agreements. ""As misdemeanor cases only involve a maximum of one year in jail and felony cases involve punishment of up to life in prison or death, felony experience is absolutely necessary,"" he said. 
As for Bradley’s experience, the write-up says he has been a prosecutor since 1987, starting out in the Harris County district attorney’s office. He joined the Williamson County district attorney’s office two years later. In 2001, Gov. Rick Perry appointed Bradley to lead the office, according to the county’s website, and he first won election in 2002. 
Bradley told us that he continues to personally handle some cases but that the majority are handled by assistant prosecutors. He said that on a daily basis, he discusses cases with prosecutors in his office, advises them and sets policy. 
To support his statement about Duty’s experience, Bradley first pointed us to a television news report in which he said Duty admitted his claim was correct. In the March 23, 2012, story by the Austin area’s YNN television channel, Bradley, in an interview, said: ""I have over 20 years of experience; Jana Duty has never prosecuted a single adult felony case. And that’s the work that the DA does."" Next, the YNN reporter, Alana Rocha, said: ""She admits that’s true, but that her office has tried many such cases."" 
Many adult felony cases? We found that statement confusing, so we sought clarity from the reporter. Rocha told us that Duty had admitted to her that Bradley’s claim is correct. Rocha also said that after we inquired, she checked with Duty afresh and Duty clarified that her office prosecutes juvenile felonies. 
In Williamson County, the county attorney’s office is responsible for juvenile cases. 
As further support for his statement, Bradley pointed us to a February 2012 candidate forum in Cedar Park, where, he said, Duty neither questioned the truthfulness of his claim nor offered examples of adult felony prosecution experience. 
According to a video of the forum on the website of the Central Texas 9-12 Project, Bradley raised the issue of experience in his closing statement, although he made a narrower claim there than in his op-ed piece, charging that Duty has never tried — as opposed to the broader idea of ""prosecuted"" — an adult felony case. 
That’s an important distinction because most felony cases are resolved through plea bargains, not trials. Bradley told us that more than 95 percent of the cases in his office end in such agreements. 
At the forum, Bradley said: ""How can you have a district attorney run an office, decide the death penalty for people, if you’ve never stood in court in a felony case and tried an adult? And the fact is Ms. Duty"" has not done so. 
Duty responded during her final statement that she is ""also a career prosecutor"" and that she has experience ""trying many, many cases,"" pointing to work she has done in Bexar and Williamson counties. She said she has tried 30 to 40 jury trials and has handled family violence and Child Protective Services cases, including those that result in the termination of someone’s parental rights. ""And again let me remind you that in a parental termination case, you are taking children away from their parents forever, and that is just as serious as putting somebody in prison,"" Duty said. 
Duty did not respond to our requests to discuss her professional experience. However, according to an Oct. 7, 2004, Austin American-Statesman news article and her campaign website, she had previously served two stints as a prosecutor: as an assistant district attorney in Bexar County after she passed the Texas bar exam in 1997, and as an assistant Williamson County attorney from 1999 to 2001. 
Her campaign website says Duty’s earlier work at the Williamson county attorney’s office came in the ""Child Protective Services and Protective Order section"" and then in the criminal division. 
According to legal experts we contacted, Child Protective Services cases generally involve allegations of abuse or neglect against a child’s parent or guardian and are civil, not criminal, cases. The website of the Williamson county attorney’s office says pursuing protective orders for qualified applicants is one way that the county attorney ""aids in the prevention of domestic violence."" A protective order is ""a civil court order issued against a person who has committed family violence,"" the site says. Such orders can, for example, require that an abusive husband have no contact with his wife for a certain period of time. 
Either way, adult felony cases are not handled in the Williamson county attorney’s office. 
But did Duty handle such cases while working for the Bexar County district attorney, which prosecutes felonies and misdemeanors? 
That’s at least unclear. 
In her campaign bio, Duty says that in Bexar County, she ""worked as the Protective Order Attorney and then as a family violence prosecutor in the family violence court."" We sought information from the Bexar County district attorney’s office about the cases she handled there, but officials declined to comment. 
Brian Fischer, a Houston criminal defense attorney, told us that generally, prosecutions of family violence cases can involve misdemeanors or felonies. 
In an email, Duty replied to our inquiry about Bradley’s claim without speaking directly to its accuracy. She wrote: ""My office prosecutes juvenile felony crimes and adult misdemeanor crimes (and a lot of other stuff). The Texas Rules of Evidence, the Texas Rules of Procedure (and) the elements of a felony are exactly the same for an adult case as they are in a juvenile case. In my 15 years as a lawyer, I have tried hundreds of adult misdemeanor, juvenile misdemeanor and felony crimes, Child Protective Services cases, and Protective Orders. I would venture to say that I have just as much trial experience as Mr. Bradley."" 
Finally, we explored Duty’s intimation that there are similarities between the prosecution of adult felonies and juvenile felonies by consulting Texas legal experts, including Fischer, who specializes in juvenile law; two law professors; and a juvenile defense lawyer who prosecuted both adult and felony cases over nearly three decades in the Harris County district attorney’s office. 
The experts did not agree on the degree of similarities or differences between prosecuting adult and juvenile felonies. 
However, they all noted that juveniles can be charged with the same felony crimes as adults and that prosecutors are held to the same burden of proof in juvenile felony trials as in adult ones; they must prove ""beyond a reasonable doubt"" that the accused has committed the crime. Also, they agreed, the rules of evidence and the elements of the crime are the same in juvenile and adult cases. 
The issue of procedure is more complicated. The experts told us that juvenile courts operate under a sort of hybrid system, in which rules of civil procedure govern many aspects of a juvenile felony case while others are governed by rules of criminal procedure, as adult cases are. 
Other distinctions: The maximum sentence a juvenile can receive is 40 years, while adults face sentences up to life in prison or even death. 
Duty did not respond to our questions about how many juvenile felony trials she had prosecuted. 
According to data from the state Office of Court Administration, there were 205 new juvenile felony cases filed in the county’s juvenile court from Sept. 1, 2010, through April 30, 2012. During that time, 142 juvenile felony cases were resolved through pleas of ""true"" — the equivalent of pleading guilty in adult court. Also, 31 felony cases were dismissed. There was one trial, of a misdemeanor case, according to the data. 
Our ruling 
Duty points out that her office prosecutes adult misdemeanors and juvenile felonies, though it appears that none made it to trial in recent years. Hers may be a reasonable point. Still, Bradley specified that Duty had not conducted adult felony prosecutions.

Shelley Adler claims Jon Runyan voted to end programs for homeless veterans
","
A Democrat hoping to oust U.S. Rep. Jon Runyan recently criticized the Republican congressman’s record on supporting homeless veterans.

Shelley Adler is vying for Runyan’s seat representing New Jersey’s third congressional district, which includes Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst. During an interview on NJTV’s ""On the Record"" that aired May 4 host Michael Aron asked Adler how her opponent let veterans down if he’s lauded for his representation of that military base.

Adler said two issues were at play: active-duty military personnel and veterans.

""With respect to veterans who are no longer active duty, they are out of service, we owe much more of a duty to the veterans of our country than we have been showing at all. And I think the disrespect by voting to end programs to aid homeless veterans particularly when that population is increasing,"" Adler said, before Aron jumped in to ask her whether she was referring to U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan (R-Wisc.)’s budget proposal.

She wasn’t. Adler’s campaign spokesman Michael Muller pointed to a budget appropriations bill passed by the Republican-controlled House on Feb. 19, 2011 to back Adler’s claim.

Runyan as well as 234 of his fellow Republicans voted for that bill, which did not fund 10,000 new housing vouchers for homeless veterans. But the bill continued funding for roughly 30,000 vouchers issued in previous years.

The vouchers, which help homeless veterans by subsidizing a portion of their rent, are part of a program run by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) and the Department of Veterans Affairs.

Each year from 2008 to 2010, Congress approved $75 million in funding for approximately 10,000 new vouchers for the HUD-Veterans Affairs Supportive Housing program, or HUD-VASH. Funding for existing vouchers is renewed every year.

The GOP bill in 2011 had no impact on the existing vouchers, according to Donna White, a HUD spokeswoman. ""Any future funding would be on the line,"" White said, but ""existing funding would be protected.""

And ultimately, Congress funded new vouchers that year.

A compromise bill provided $50 million, instead of $75 million, in funding for vouchers for the fiscal year. Runyan voted for that bill, which the president signed into law.

Muller, Adler’s campaign spokesman, said, ""this is still a case that Runyan voted to defund the program with no guarantee that a compromise would bail out his bad vote based on these facts.""

A Runyan spokesman pointed out that the congressman also voted for an additional $75 million for vouchers in fiscal 2012, which PolitiFact New Jersey confirmed.

It’s also worth noting that during the 2011 debate Republicans argued the program had unused vouchers that should be issued before the government funded new ones.

Some Democrats disagreed.

FactCheck.org, a project of the Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania, looked at two claims in the wake of the vote: a Democratic claim that the GOP bill would leave 10,000 homeless veterans out on the streets and a Republican claim that 11,000 vouchers were ""waiting"" to be used.  

The fact-checking group found in April 2011 that neither claim was accurate.

At that time, the program had about 2,400 unclaimed vouchers, enough, FactCheck.org found, to make it through the rest of the fiscal year, which ended on Sept. 30, 2011.

Our ruling

In a television interview, Adler said her opponent voted to ""end programs to aid homeless veterans.""

Runyan voted for a bill that did not include funding for 10,000 new housing vouchers for homeless veterans. The bill would have had no impact on existing vouchers.

The bill wouldn’t have expanded the program, but it wouldn’t have ended it. And Runyan ultimately voted for another bill, which became law, that included funding for new vouchers.

We rate Adler's statement False.
