Gun-rights group says bill would criminalize leaving gun at home with someone else for more than a week
","
As gun legislation works its way through the U.S. Senate, gun rights groups warn that some proposals in the original bill could create accidental felons. 
One such email warning, from an Arizona group, says, ""You would be committing a federal felony if you leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms."" 
Could hosting a house-sitter become a crime? Could your unsuspecting roommates face a felony? 
The bill, known as the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, faces votes on a series of amendments, most prominently one proposed by Sens. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., and Pat Toomey, R-Pa. 
So all bets are off on the bill’s final language. 
Still, as the debate unfolds, we were curious: Does Senate Bill 649 make felons of vacationing gun owners with roommates or house guests? 
Gun transfers 
As introduced in the Senate in March, S. 649 requires background checks for all gun sales, with a limited set of exceptions. 
And it’s not just sales that are subject to the law — but gun ""transfers."" In general, it would be illegal to give your gun to someone else without seeking a federal background check. 
But there are a series of exceptions that seek to loosen the requirement in some situations — for example, handing your gun to a friend at a shooting range or while hunting legally together, giving a gun as a gift to a close relative or leaving a gun in a will. 
It’s also okay under the bill to lend your gun to someone in your own home or yard — as long as that ""temporary transfer"" lasts less than seven days. 
Thus, the issue raised by the Arizona Citizens Defense League. 
""While the proposed legislation contains limited exceptions for transfers such as between family members,"" says the email, sent to supporters April 10, ""a little digging shows that you would be committing a federal felony if you ...  leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms."" 
So, what happens if a buddy house-sits or a roommate stays home during your eight-day vacation? 
The answer: It would likely depend on the circumstances. 
""I would say it should be changed to ‘you might be committing a federal felony if you leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms,’"" said Clark Neily, who helped represent security guard Dick Heller in his successful Supreme Court challenge to D.C.’s handgun ban. 
If you locked up your guns and expressly forbade others from using them, you would have a pretty good argument that you hadn’t transferred possession, attorneys told us. 
But say your weapons were available to guests or roommates — that nothing would prevent them from using your guns while you were out of town. Then you might have a problem. 
The federal government tends to have an expansive definition of ""possession,"" under various laws, Neily said. 
""I would say there is a real possibility that someone could be convicted under S. 649 for leaving town for more than seven days while someone else is at home with their guns,"" he said. 
Still, a house guest’s mere ""access"" to your weapons wouldn’t necessarily qualify as possession, said Larry Rosenthal, a law professor at Chapman University School of Law who has worked as a federal prosecutor and argued before the Supreme Court as an attorney for the City of Chicago. 
He pointed to a 2012 case decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals’ Seventh Circuit, United States vs. Griffin, in which a felon had been convicted of illegally possessing firearms and ammunition because he lived with his dad, who had hunting gear around the house. 
The court overturned the conviction, explaining the government’s argument ""confuses access with possession,"" Rosenthal said. 
Meanwhile, just staying in a home with weapons — especially if the house-sitter or roommate didn’t know they were there — wouldn’t plausibly qualify as a ""transfer"" of a firearm, Rosenthal said. There would have to be a ""knowing passage of control."" 
So leaving your roommate home alone for weeks, oblivious to the shotgun under your bed, likely wouldn’t violate the bill’s provisions. 
Our ruling 
An Arizona group says a gun bill before the Senate would make it a federal felony to ""leave town for more than seven days, and leave someone else at home with your firearms."" 
Indeed, S. 649, as introduced in the Senate, allows for ""temporary transfers"" of guns in your own home that last less than seven days. But leaving a house-sitter or roommate with access to weapons while you’re away for a longer stretch, attorneys explained to PolitiFact, could raise the possibility of violating federal law under the bill’s provisions. Still, experts told us a gun owner might avoid such a consequence by locking up weapons and denying permission to use them. And it’s not clear courts would interpret mere access as a transfer of possession.

Americans United for Life says 1,270 babies died after attempted abortions in 2010
","
A bill requiring physicians to treat infants who survive abortion attempts is moving through the Legislature without the usual partisan fight, though some lawmakers have questioned whether it addresses an ongoing problem. 
An anti-abortion activist used a specific figure in a recent committee hearing to reassure lawmakers HB 1129/SB 1636 is necessary. 
""The tragedy of infants born alive following attempted abortions is real,"" said Charmaine Yoest, president and CEO of Americans United for Life, on April 9. ""It is not the hypothetical that is sometimes reported. In 2010 alone, 1,270 infants were reported to have died following attempted abortions and notably that is only one year."" 
Yoest said without elaborating there are two cases in Florida. After the meeting, reporters asked Yoest about the number she used. Yoest told them the figure came from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 
But the CDC, which collects data from most state health departments on the number of legal induced abortions performed each year, does not collect data on infants who die after surviving abortion attempts. 
Neither does the Alan Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that supports women’s access to abortions and collects abortion data. Neither Guttmacher nor the CDC has published its 2010 data for abortions. 
""We have no idea where this number comes from,"" said Rebecca Wind, Guttmacher Institute spokeswoman. 
A committee analysis says there is no federal requirement to report the number of infants born alive during an attempted abortions. So Rep. Cary Pigman, R-Avon Park, included in his legislation a requirement for physicians who perform abortions in Florida to report cases of infants born alive to the state. 
""If in two years time or four years time we find that there are zero cases, it’s a prayer answered,"" Pigman said at an April 4 committee hearing of his bill. ""If we find in two years time that there’s a half dozen cases a year, then we have some issues."" 
If there are no statistics or reporting requirements, where did Americans United for Life find this figure? We dug in. 
Twenty-eight states have laws protecting infants born alive. ""Infants Born Alive"" mirrors a federal law signed by President George W. Bush in 2002. Supporters say it is necessary to enact a state law so there is no doubt that an infant ""born alive"" -- defined as an infant who breathes or has heartbeats or muscle movements, regardless of whether the extraction method was natural or induced  -- must be taken to a hospital for treatment appropriate for gestation age. 
A failed abortion could result in a live birth in a late-term abortion, which can only be performed if two physicians agree the mother's life is at risk, or if the mother was further into her pregnancy than thought. Physicians under the Florida proposal would have to provide medical care for an infant born alive after an abortion or face a first-degree misdemeanor charge. 
Pigman, an emergency physician, has referenced similar or exact figures as Yoest in committee hearings, but he characterized them differently and stressed the lack of exact data. 
In the bill’s first hearing, Pigman mentioned CDC data on deaths for infants from 22 weeks of gestation to seven days after birth called ""other perinatal conditions."" This category -- which totaled 1,270 deaths in 2010 -- is further broken down into categories of international medical codes for causes of death, including cardiovascular disorders (838 deaths), digestive system disorders (92 deaths), undefined cerebral problems (183 deaths) and ""other conditions originating in the perinatal period"" (130 deaths). 
""I don’t know which portion of that 1,270 were due to abortions or some other rare circumstances,"" Pigman said in the April 4 committee. 
Inside that latter subcategory -- ""other conditions originating in the perinatal period"" -- is a designation called ""termination of pregnancy, affecting fetus and newborn."" The CDC doesn’t have numbers for that designation for 2010 yet. 
In 2008, the CDC reported 33 deaths using that designation. Whether the abortion was elective or performed to save the life of the mother is unclear. 
Americans United for Life spokeswoman Kristi Hamrick said any number is problematic because abortion data is always incomplete. California, for instance, is one of a few states that does not report the number of abortion procedures that happen there. 
Hamrick directed us to a blog post written by the group's legal team about limited CDC data and anecdotal evidence of infants born alive, including two Florida cases of infants surviving abortion procedures (one died, one survived with catastrophic injuries) and the trial of Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell. The post does not support Yoest's specific claim about 1,270 infants who die after abortion procedures, offering instead the more nuanced breakdown for the 1,270 figure that we heard from Pigman. 
Our ruling 
Yoest said 1,270 infants in 2010 ""were reported to have died following attempted abortions."" 
The figure is based on an ""other"" category of perinatal deaths, but it does not mean what she says it means. Included in this category are babies who die of various other issues, mainly heart problems.

Mike Villarreal says 2011 Legislature imposed physical fitness tests on Texas school kids
","
The 2011 Legislature might best be remembered for cuts in spending, including changes to education aid. 
Lawmakers also directed schools to check the physical fitness of students, state Rep. Mike Villarreal, D-San Antonio, told House colleagues during April 4, 2013, consideration of proposed amendments to the pending 2014-15 state budget. 
""During the last legislative session in 2011, there was a program that was created that requires all of our public schools to collect health information on students, to test them on their respiratory system, on their weight,"" he said. ""It’s called FitnessGram. Every school district, every school, implements this program, collects the data, sends it to"" the Texas Education Agency. 
We looked into the accuracy of his flashback after inquiring into why he mentioned the mandate. 
The day he spoke, Villarreal won House approval of an amendment to that body’s version of the next budget. Villarreal described his amendment as enabling state researchers to access and analyze results of the fitness tests collected by the agency. Asked if researchers are restricted from getting such results now, Villarreal’s chief of staff, Peter Clark, said by email the agency ""has been slow to provide this data to researchers, so we wanted to communicate legislative direction."" 
So, did the 2011 Legislature set the fitness tests in motion? 
Nope. It turns out state law has required students in grades three through 12 to take fitness tests since the 2007-08 school year, though the 2011 Legislature tweaked the law to limit the aerobic, abdominal, flexibility and upper body tests to students enrolled in physical education classes, Texas Education Agency spokeswoman DeEtta Culbertson told us by phone. 
The 2007 Legislature established the mandate that students be tested for fitness, which came along with a fresh requirement that middle school students take physical education classes. 
At the time, advocates included state Sen. Jane Nelson, R-Flower Mound, who told the Austin American-Statesman in June 2007 that she was troubled by studies showing some fifth-graders were overweight. ""Anyone who has taught public school knows the old adage of 'sound body, sound mind' really is true,"" Nelson said. ""This generation of young people will live shorter lives than their parents unless we change the status quo. We've got to do this."" The Statesman reported that the FitnessGram software had been developed by Kenneth Cooper, the well-known Dallas exercise researcher. 
Under the law, each district must annually assess the physical fitness of students in PE classes, with a state-ordered ""assessment instrument"" considering factors including aerobic capacity, body composition and muscular strength, endurance and flexibility, the law says. Also, the law requires the exam to include standards specific to each student’s age and gender and to be based on the ""physical fitness level required for good health."" 
A FitnessGram manual suggests that students run or walk and have their percentage of body fat gauged, either through a skin-fold test using calipers or by measuring height and weight. Other suggested tests include curl-ups (or sit-ups) and push-ups. (Parents of students in the Austin school district may request their child’s FitnessGram report from the school’s PE teacher, the district’s PE supervisor, Michele Rusnak, said by phone. She added that in instances where ""anything really glaring"" emerges in a test, the teacher talks to the school nurse, who reaches out to the student’s parents.) 
By email, Culbertson said aggregated school-by-school or district-by-district results, which do not identify individual students, are available online. 
How’s it been going for the kids? Unevenly, it appears. 
Statewide through 2009-10, the vast majority of Texas students had failed to pass all six Fitnessgram tests, according to an April 18, 2011, Statesman news article. More recently, nearly 46 percent of more than two million Texas children who participated in the 2012 tests were found to be at risk for obesity, according to the Reshaping Texas web site, which was created at legislative direction by State Comptroller Susan Combs. Some 54 percent of the tested students achieved a ""healthy fitness zone"" rating, according to the site, which features an interactive map for checking particular districts. In the Austin district, according to the map, 32 percent of students who were tested came out at high risk of obesity, 12 percent were at some risk and 55 percent landed in the ""healthy fitness zone."" 
Finally, we hop-skipped to asking why Villarreal, a House member since 2000, traced the origin of the fitness tests to 2011. By email, Clark said the representative was reflecting on a 2011 proposal tightening what school districts report to the state about how students fare on the tests. Previously, the law said districts should report summary data from the tests, broken out by grade level and other sifts as ordered by the state education commissioner. Members in 2011 changed the law to require districts to report each student’s performance, though the law continued to bar any student from being identified in the reports by name or otherwise. 
Clark later said Villarreal mistakenly said the tests were mandated by the 2011 Legislature. 
Our ruling 
Villarreal said the 2011 Legislature ordered Texas students to take fitness tests including checks of weight and respiratory systems. 
The mandated tests can involve checking each student’s weight and the aerobic tests relate to respiration. But lawmakers launched the program a few years earlier, in 2007, though they approved changes in 2011.

Bird group cries foul about feral cat bill
","
Florida legislators are taking up the usual public policy topics this session: health care, taxes and campaign finance reform. Then there’s the bill about feral cats. 
Don’t call them feral cats, though. Bills in the Legislature are re-branding them with a more user-friendly name: ""community cats."" 
Not so fast, say the bird lovers. The American Bird Conservancy is crying fowl, er foul. 
The bills ""would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists, in the face of potential public health and property value impacts, as well as predicted high mortality for native animals,"" the groups said in a press release. 
The conservancy says passage of two bills (HB 1121/SB 1320) would make it easier for people to dump unwanted cats in areas where they roam aplenty. 
""This is shocking,"" said Grant Sizemore, the conservancy’s Cats Indoors program manager. ""Hoarding of animals in homes is prohibited in most places, but we now have Florida encouraging it in public places such as city parks. There is no question that the health of local citizenry -- including children -- is being put at risk, property values in the hoarding areas will be impacted and local wildlife will continue to be devastated."" 
PolitiFact Florida wanted to research whether this bill would allow cat hoarding. 
The cat bills 
The ""Community Cats"" legislation, sponsored by Rep. Holly Raschein, R-Key Largo, and Sen. Darren Soto, D-Orlando, attempts to rein in cat overpopulation. 
Several communities have established programs to spay and care for feral cats and release them, however there were concerns among some involved in such programs that the release of cats would constitute abandonment and violate state animal cruelty laws. 
The bill amends the state’s animal cruelty law to state that someone who spays or neuters a feral cat and then releases it is not abandoning the cat or breaking the law. The bill also states that counties and cities can still adopt their own ordinances to curtail the feral cat population. 
The bill defines a community cat as an ""outdoor, free-roaming cat that lacks visible owner identification"" and defines a ""community cat owner"" as someone who gives that cat food or water. 
Cat and wildlife activists have been battling each other about how to handle feral cats for years. A 2003 Tampa Bay Times article described a cat vs. rat battle at the Ocean Reef Club, an exclusive community of multimillion-dollar homes near a state park and wildlife refuge. Homeowners set up a program to take care of hundreds of stray cats, but meanwhile the populations of the Key Largo wood rat and cotton mouse, both endangered, dwindled. Wildlife experts pointed fingers at the cats. 
""It's a very serious problem for Key Largo wood rats,"" University of Florida wildlife scientist Frank Mazzotti said at the time. ""Releasing a feral cat in a natural area is like releasing a serial murderer in a maternity ward."" 
Central to the bill debate is whether programs that encourage the trap, neuter and release of feral cats reduce the feral cat population and the dangers to wildlife and humans. 
A study by scientists including from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that cats kill up to 3.7 billion birds a year, and found no connection between the programs (called TNR) and fewer bird deaths. ""Claims that TNR colonies are effective in reducing cat populations, and, therefore, wildlife mortality, are not supported by peer-reviewed scientific studies,"" it said. 
A 2003 Florida International University study concluded that TNR cat programs at two parks encouraged illegal dumping of cats and led to a population increase at one park, while the other remained stable. 
The Florida Department of Health, which remains neutral on the cat bill, stated in a 2012 rabies prevention report that managing feral cats ""is not tenable on public health grounds because of the persistent threat posed to communities from injury and disease."" 
Bill supporters point to a study published in the journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association that concluded a TNR program at the University of Central Florida reduced the population. They also point to this research about the benefits of vaccinating cats. 
Would this lead to hoarding? 
So there is evidence that feral cats carry diseases and kill wildlife. But would this bill allow animal hoarding? 
A spokeswoman for the Humane Society, a group supporting the bill, said bill opponents are misusing the word ""hoarding."" 
""Animal hoarding is a serious mental illness,"" Humane society spokeswoman Katie Lisnik told PolitiFact. ""It is a severe case of neglect and abuse of animals."" That’s different from programs that care for cats, she said. 
Hoarding -- generally speaking, not exclusively to animals -- will be listed by the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and statistical Manual for the first time this year, said Smith College psychology professor Randy Frost who studies hoarding. 
We asked Frost if Florida’s bill could lead to increased hoarding. 
""I don’t know that there is any way to tell,"" he said. 
""I think it would be hard to hoard in a field or public place. ... I don’t know of many cases of hoarding where hoarding occurred in public. I’d have to think about that."" 
Brevard County recently placed a moratorium on registration for cat colonies -- county officials know of several hundred colonies. Bob Brown, captain of enforcement for Brevard County animal services, said he doesn’t think he would call these cat colonies hoarding. 
In a cat colony, ""they have no control if the cat comes or goes. Usually cat hoarders want to keep things confined within their control."" 
An outdoor colony is different than the homes where there are cat urine stains all over the walls or cat feces dripping out of cabinets. 
""We’ve seen some real doozies,"" he said. 
Robert Johns, a spokesman with the bird conservancy, said the law removes penalties for people who abandon animals to public places.   
""Instead of having a hoard of cats in a house, which is illegal in many places, we would simply have dozens or hundreds of them outdoors in many places, essentially taking over public land to be used by feral cats,"" he said. 
Our ruling 
The American Bird Conservancy said a bill ""would authorize the public hoarding of cats by feral cat activists."" 
The bill would authorize people to neuter and release feral cats. But it’s difficult to predict how these future cat colonies will be managed and controlled by local ordinances. 
Is it possible that someone could hoard feral cats outdoors? Sure. But animal hoarders typically want to be able to control their cats, so that’s why they hoard inside their own homes. 
The research we reviewed about feral cats focused on numbers, health problems and threats to wildlife they pose -- not whether it constitutes hoarding. That could be because hoarding isn’t the central debate about these feral cats, but it is a heated word that draws attention.

Gun-rights group says Senate bill proposes ‘universal registration of all firearms and their owners’
","
Just what’s in that new gun bill under debate in the Senate? 
Opponents would love to tell you all about it. 
""Stop Federal Universal Firearms Registration!"" says the subject line of an email from an Arizona group this week. 
The message urges readers to contact their senators, warning: ""In reality S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners."" 
The bill, known as the Safe Communities, Safe Schools Act of 2013, would make all gun sales subject to the nation’s background check laws, with limited exceptions. 
Does it propose universal firearm registration? 
Background checks and registries 
We read the bill, and consulted experts, including legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, attorneys who helped represent security guard Dick Heller in his successful Supreme Court challenge to D.C.’s handgun ban, and the spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League. 
The bill would require ""a background check for every firearm sale"" — or transfer of ownership — with a few exceptions, such as for certain family members. Right now, federal background checks are only required for sales through licensed gun dealers. 
Here’s how background checks work. 
The FBI maintains the National Instant Criminal Background Check System. 
When you buy a gun from a federally licensed dealer, you fill out a form with personally identifying information. The dealer uses the NICS to match that information with various records to make sure you’re not, for example, a felon who’s not allowed to own a weapon. It’s a computerized process that’s only supposed to take about 30 seconds, but in the case of an unclear match, can take up to three days. 
If you’re cleared to purchase a gun, the government is required to destroy all identifying information about you before the next business day. Instead, the dealer is required to store the form. 
That’s right: Federal law requires destruction of records and bans creation of a federal gun registry. 
Does S. 649, sponsored by Sen. Harry Reid, D-Nev., change that? 
Several attorneys we spoke to said no, it didn’t — it leaves those provisions in place. More people would be subject to background checks, but a federal database of that information would remain as illegal as ever. 
But Chris Calabrese, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union, says the language of the bill leaves a door open for a new kind of record of sales between private sellers — as opposed to sales by federally licensed gun dealers — a record that may not be subject to the registry ban. 
""We have a real fear with this particular legislative language that this would result in new records being created,"" he said. 
He points to a legal phrase in the bill — ""notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter"" — as perhaps allowing creation and, later, collection of those records, even though existing law rules out ""a system of registration of firearms, firearms owners, or firearms transactions or dispositions."" 
So, even if there’s no intent to create such a loophole in the registry ban, the law doesn’t explicitly rule it out, he argues. 
Call it the possibility of a partial registry. 
""I don't think it's a crazy idea to say that if the records exist, there would be a push to use them for other things,""  Calabrese said. 
He contrasts the bill’s vague language with an amendment proposed by Sens. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., and Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., that would explicitly bar any such registry and adds the possibility of up to 15 years in prison for violators. 
But even if the federal government created a new type of record for gun sales between private sellers — and tracked them — that wouldn’t be ""universal registration of all firearms and their owners,"" as suggested by the Arizona group’s email message. 
""There are at least 300 million guns in private ownership in America today, and I am not aware of any provision of S. 649 that would require the registration of those guns or assist the federal government in determining precisely who owns them,"" said Clark Neily, who was co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller. 
(Still, he said, mentioning the ACLU’s worry, the Arizona email ""touches upon a genuine concern."") 
So what does the Arizona Citizens Defense League say about its claim that the bill ""is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners""? 
Essentially, that the government will violate its own rules against keeping background check records. 
""This is where background knowledge of the issue is so important, and goes WAY beyond what is written in statute,"" said Charles Heller, a radio host and spokesperson for the Arizona Citizens Defense League. (He’s no relation to Dick Heller.) 
He says the FBI’s NICS system could illegally store results of all background checks. 
""This is simply a method to herd all transfers to being ‘on record,’ for later confiscation,"" he said. 
But the email message didn’t say the law would make it easier for the federal government to create an illegal gun registry. It said: 
""The true subject of S. 649 is the requirement to report all firearms transfers to the federal government via ‘universal background checks.’ In reality S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners. As history has repeatedly shown us, and is currently being demonstrated in New York, registration is the prelude to confiscation."" 
That’s simply not what the bill proposes. 
Robert Levy, the chairman of the board of directors of the libertarian Cato Institute, was in his own words, ""a vigorous advocate for the right to possess firearms for self-defense"" as co-counsel to Dick Heller in District of Columbia vs. Heller. 
He acknowledges the concern that expanding background checks creates a data trail that Americans must trust is being destroyed in a timely way by the federal government. 
Still, he says, ""it's incorrect to assert that S. 649 is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners."" 
Our ruling 
An email circulated to Arizona residents claims a bill before the Senate ""is proposing the universal registration of all firearms and their owners."" The bill expands background checks to most gun transfers. But federal rules forbid the government from keeping a record of successful background checks for more than a day. The ACLU argues it’s possible the bill creates a new type of record for some sales that may not be subject to the ban, but that’s not the same thing as ""universal registration of all firearms and their owners.""

Would a pack-a-day smoker save $1650 a year if they quit smoking?
","
Lawmakers in Salem are taking a look at the state’s cigarette tax and floating the possibility of allowing counties to add their own tax on top of the the current $1.18 per pack. Advocates spend a lot of time talking about how a higher per-pack price would cut the number of youth smokers -- and the various health benefits that would come with never starting.

But Rep. Nancy Nathanson, D-Eugene, took a slightly different tack during a House floor speech earlier this month: Not only would an increased tax save some lungs, but if smokers quit as a result of the increase, their wallets would thank them, too.

""A pack-a-day smoker who quits because of the tax increase will save about $1,650 a year to spend on other essential household goods and services, a not insubstantial number for that family,"" Nathanson said.

We started thinking about everything we’d buy with that $1,600 -- some shoes, maybe, definitely a few new records, a new computer even. Then we remembered nobody at PolitiFact Oregon smokes.

Still, we couldn’t help but wonder if Nathanson’s math added up.

We gave her office a call and they told us the figures came from a study done by the Multnomah County Health Department.

The department found that a pack ran between $4.37 to $4.97 with brands ranging from Marlboro, Lucky Strike, American Legend and Newport. That meant a pack-a-day smoker would save between $1,600 and $1,800.

Nathanson’s $1,650 figure came from the cost of L&M cigarettes at WinCo, which was $4.51 a pack.

The report’s figures came from this March and April but PolitiFact Oregon likes to do a little independent research for any given claim. We set out on our own and hit up a Safeway in downtown Portland for a price survey of our own.

Cigarettes at Safeway do not come cheap. A pack of Marlboros came in at $6.20 and you’d have to fork over $8 for American Spirits. That’d put you at a yearly savings of anywhere between $2,250 and $2,900. (We’d buy two computers with that bonus.)

We were about to check on the price of a carton of cigarettes because our moms taught us to shop in bulk, when the kind woman behind the counter said we ought to just walk a block to the nearest Plaid Pantry.

There, you could get a pack for anywhere between $4.98 and $6.25. A carton of Marlboro reds came in at $50 for 10 packs, which seemed about right.

The ruling: Nathanson said that a pack-a-day smoker would save $1,650 a year. Her numbers were based on a report from the Multnomah County Health Department, but it turns out that’s a pretty conservative estimate, at least for Portland.

Still, her point is that quitting will save a hefty chunk of change and we rate that claim True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/15/nancy-nathanson/would-pack-day-smoker-save-1650-year-if-they-quit-/

Va. Society for Human Life says Obamacare allows tax funding for most abortions
","
The Virginia Society for Human Life was cheered by the General Assembly’s passage of a measure that will bar insurers who participate in a new federally run exchange in Virginia from covering most abortions. 
The action -- which was proposed by Gov. Bob McDonnell -- only allows exchange policies to cover abortions in cases when the mother’s life is in danger, or the pregnancy was caused by rape or incest. 
Shortly after the April 3 vote, the society issued a statement saying it was ""extremely pleased that the members of the General Assembly have taken the important step to protect the taxpayers of Virginia from being forced to pay for abortions in insurance plans under the newly created federal health care exchanges."" 
We wondered whether Virginia taxpayers really were on the verge of being ""forced to pay for abortion,"" and were spared from that requirement by McDonnell’s amendment. So we took a look. 
The claim is centered on the requirements of Obamacare, which calls for statewide health insurance exchanges starting next year that will compete for the business of people who don’t have coverage through their employers. The idea is that it will allow individuals to get favorable rates paid by people in large group plans. Those who cannot afford insurance will get a federal subsidy to help them join an exchange. 
Virginia lawmakers originally had anticipated creating a state-run exchange, and in 2011 passed a bill banning most abortions from being covered in the program. But late last year, McDonnell announced Virginia would not create an exchange, a move that by default will leave the state with a federally run system. Lawmakers passed the amendment this year to guarantee that most abortions in Virginia would not be covered by the federal exchange. 
Did excluding abortion coverage spare taxpayers from having to pay for it? 
We asked Olivia Gans Turner, the president for the Virginia Society for Human Life, to explain her group’s claim. She pointed to a section of the Obamacare law that allows a state to prohibit any plan within its borders from covering abortions except in the cases when a woman’s life is in danger or instances of rape or incest -- limited circumstances that have long been covered under federal law. 
That provision makes it clear that ""the only way for a state to not pay for abortions under insurance plans is to actually enact a law providing such a prohibition,"" Turner said. 
So Turner notes, as we have, that Obamacare gives states flexibility on whether to ban abortion coverage in exchanges. 
But whatever course states chose, there is no threat that public funds would be used for most abortions. That’s because Obamacare mandates a funding mechanism that will segregate premium payments for abortions from the federal subsidies some will receive to help cover the cost of care on the exchange. 
That system requires anyone who chooses to enroll in a plan covering abortion to make two payments. The first will go into an account for all non-abortion coverage in the plan. The second payment -- of at least $1 a month -- will go into a pool used only for abortion services, according to a July 9, 2012, report by the Congressional Research Service. 
Our ruling 
The Virginia Society for Human Life said a recently passed an amendment banning insurers participating in a state exchange from covering most abortions protected ""the taxpayers of Virginia from being forced to pay for abortions."" 
The statement ignores the fact that if abortion services had been allowed, insurers would have had to charge separate premium payments for such coverage and segregate the money from all other premiums. That ensures the payments for abortions would come out of policy holders’ pockets -- not public funds. 
We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2013/apr/15/virginia-society-human-life/va-society-human-life-says-obamacare-allows-tax-fu/

Jodie Laubenberg says state money supports a TV show glorifying spouses who cheat
","
During floor debate, a Republican legislator complained that state expenditures on TV and film productions have extended to a long-running series celebrating cheating spouses.

Really?

Rep. Jodie Laubenberg of Parker initially asked a House colleague about his proposed amendment to the House version of the 2014-15 state budget.

Rep. Jeff Leach, R-Plano, said he sought to shift money from the state’s film and music marketing fund to teacher pensions. When last we wrote about the fund, overseen by the governor’s office, we noted the 2011 Legislature had agreed to spend $16 million each year to ""market Texas as a film location and promote the Texas music industry,"" according to the May 26, 2011, House-Senate conference committee report.

Laubenberg asked Leach: ""Would you like me to give you a couple of examples of things being funded with this money?"" At Leach’s go-ahead, Laubenberg replied: ""How about ‘Bad Kids Go to Hell,’ ‘Cheaters,’ ...a TV series on spouses cheating on their wives, kind of glorifying the act of cheating--yeah, entertainment for some, unless you’re the one cheated on.""

After listing other entertainment projects she described as helped along with state funds, Laubenberg closed: ""You know, if you want to watch this, fine, but I think you ought to do it on your own dime and not the state’s dime.""

To our inquiry, Laubenberg later left a message saying she had been reading from a list provided by Leach, whose office emailed us a spreadsheet listing more than 400 projects. A header on the spreadsheet says each one was ""paid"" by the Texas Moving Image Industry Incentive Program through March 2013.

More detail: The incentive program offers ""qualifying productions"" a shot at payments equaling 5 percent to 17.5 percent of the money they spend in Texas or 8 percent to 29.25 percent of eligible wages paid to Texas residents, according to agency information posted online, depending on budget levels and types of production, with both live-action and animated projects eligible.

The spreadsheet’s sixth entry indicates $74,736.58 was paid March 22, 2013, to Bobby Goldstein Productions in Dallas in connection with ""Cheaters,"" which is described on the sheet as a reality show. Lower entries show previous payments to the company in connection with ""Cheaters,"" $72,714 in May 2012 and $100,082 in May 2011, respectively.

By email, gubernatorial spokesman Josh Havens confirmed the state has paid about $248,000 since May 2011 to the Dallas company that produces ""Cheaters,"" which is among several hundred projects benefiting from such aid.

""The program met the incentive program requirements for economic impact and Texas resident employment,"" Havens said.

By phone, the show’s executive producer, Bobby Goldstein, told us that he hires more than 20 full-time and probably 30 part-time employees for the show and the company contributes a lot in taxes.

So, is the legislator correct that the series celebrates unfaithfulness?

Not so, Havens replied, pointing out the message that appears at the start of each episode stating that from the program’s ""surveillance cameras, you are about to view actual true stories, filmed live, documenting the pain of a spouse or lover caused by infidelity. This program is both dedicated to the faithful and presented to the falsehearted to encourage their renewal of temperance and virtue."" (We confirmed the text here.)

Goldstein said: ""We don’t make this show and make it look like somebody did something good. We point out they did wrong. It’s sort of a scarlet ‘A.’""

We viewed excerpts of episodes placed on YouTube by viewers. Our impression was the show centers on confrontations between purported cheaters, cheatees and, often, involved third parties. A vivid example involved a cheating man punching his irate girlfriend in a parking lot; blood runs. Another excerpt showed a man being confronted in a bed as a dominatrix edges out of camera range.

Critic Pete Vonder Haar described the show this way in an April 25, 2012, account in the Houston Press, an alternative weekly. ""The premise of the show is simplicity itself: a man or woman, suspecting their partner of philandering, contacts the steely professional ‘Cheaters’ investigative team. They, in turn, put the suspected party under surveillance, amassing evidence of their infidelity for presenting to the complainant. A confrontation is ‘arranged’ between the aggrieved party and their wayward lover. Hilarity then ensues, if by ‘hilarity’ you mean emotional breakdowns and the occasional threat of physical violence.""

The article, which Goldstein called accurate, says the show is primarily taped in the Dallas-Fort Worth area, though there have been Houston-area forays.

""I’m not one given to hyperbole,"" Vonder Haar wrote, ""but ‘Cheaters’ is as great an American institution as baseball and morbid obesity. Who but the good old U.S. of A. would so brazenly combine our love of moralistic posturing (the wayward partners are referred to as ‘suspects’ as if they were felons) with salacious, albeit (barely) pixelated footage of sexual transgressions.""

Finally, we revisited posted state guidelines for the incentives to see if any provision might restrict support for ""Cheaters."" The guidelines say projects not eligible for the aid include those considered obscene as that term is defined in the state’s penal code, meaning something the ""average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that taken as a whole appeals to the prurient interest in sex."" The code further lists explicit acts defined as obscene and also says something is obscene if taken as a whole, it ""lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value.""

Havens said in his email that the Texas Film Commission ""felt the project fell well short of the definition of obscene.""

Our ruling

Laubenberg said the state helped fund a show that glorifies cheating spouses.

Mild point: The state-supported show, ""Cheaters,"" doesn’t limit itself to exposing cheating spouses. We’re not sure, either, that everyone would agree the show glorifies infidelity, considering its theme is to expose the practice and touch off emotional confrontations. The legislator could have clarified that an intended point of the show is that cheaters are wrongdoers.

We rate the claim as Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/apr/15/jodie-laubenberg/jodie-laubenberg-says-state-money-supports-tv-show/
"['Ohio', 'Social Security', 'Rob Portman']","
Sen. Rob Portman says the Social Security disability fund soon will run dry
","
You hear it often: Social Security is going broke. What you hear less often is an analysis of Social Security’s components -- its old-age retiree program and its disability program. 
Sen. Rob Portman discussed both parts during a newsmaker breakfast on April 9 sponsored by Politico, the Washington-based newspaper and website. Portman’s remarks on the disability program could be considered jarring to those who don’t pay close attention, so we thought we’d take a step back to check them out. 
Portman said, ""The Social Security disability fund is going belly up in 2016."" And 2016, he noted, is ""right around the corner."" 
Portman is correct -- from an accounting standpoint, and as of right now. According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the most recent Social Security trustees’ annual report, the Social Security account that disburses monthly disability payments will not only pay out more money in 2016 than it takes in through taxes, but also will spend the last dollar it has in reserve by the end of that year. 
As budget documents put it, the Disability Insurance, or DI, Trust Fund -- the account that held surpluses and was tapped to help make up any recent shortfall -- will be ""exhausted"" that year. This is the ""disability fund"" Portman was referring to. 
The same fate isn’t expected to hit the other piece of the Social Security pie, Old Age and Survivors Insurance, until 2036 (or 2038 under a different analysis).  Disabled workers and their spouses and dependents account for 18 percent of overall Social Security payments, according to the Congressional Budget Office.   
The coming shortfall will occur because disability payments have exceeded the program’s noninterest income since 2005. This occurred for several reasons, including a liberalization of the Social Security screening process with a 1984 law that made certain non-fatal conditions such as back pain, arthritis and mental illness potential qualifiers; a rise in the program’s income-replacement computation, ""which strengthened the incentives for workers to seek benefits,"" and an increase in the female labor force that expanded the pool of insured workers, according to a 2006 analysis by economists for the National Bureau of Economic Research. The latter provided more tax money but also expanded the pool eligible for benefits. 
But there is another reason, cited by the CBO last July: the aging of the baby boom generation. 
""More older people suffer from debilitating conditions; moreover, the program’s qualification standards for older workers are less strict than those for younger workers because older people are assumed to be less able to adapt to new types of work,"" the CBO reported. It noted that ""between calendar years 1996 and 2009—the approximate period during which the baby-boom generation entered their 50s—the share of disabled worker benefits awarded to older workers (age 45 and older) rose from 67 percent to 76 percent."" 
But if payroll tax income to the program is insufficient already, why isn’t  the DI program broke now? 
The answer is that the program still has money left from better days -- held in the Trust Fund in the form of government securities. That makes it still possible to pay 100 percent of all benefits. But in 2016, those savings will be depleted., 
A few numbers make this clearer. In 2011, the DI program paid out $132.3 billion, including $2.9 billion in administrative expenses. But it only took in $81.9 billion in dedicated payroll taxes and $1.6 billion in income taxes that some beneficiaries must pay (depending on their incomes). 
To make up the rest, it tapped the Trust Fund. It will not be able to do that and pay full expected benefits in 2016. 
From a practical standpoint, Congress and the White House are likely to act before then. A number of proposals provide ways to avoid a retiree and disabled-worker calamity, some with changes to the payroll tax, some with benefit cuts, some with both. That makes the odds slim that Social Security’s disability fund will actually go broke. 
But until that happens, all anybody has are the projections. And they are clear. So is this doomsday for Social Security? 
Not at all. Social Security will still take in enough money to pay a percentage of the claims. Although federal law says the Trust Fund must have assets for claims to be paid, Congress can change the law. More likely is a broader fix from Congress. 
Portman recognizes this, as he makes clear often -- and did so again at the Politico  breakfast -- in his calls for entitlement reform. The Social Security trustees report in 2012 recognized this too, saying, ""The DI program faces the most immediate financing shortfall of any of the separate trust funds; thus lawmakers need to act soon to avoid reduced payments to DI beneficiaries four years from now."" 

So yes, we can hope or expect that the problem will be solved before 2016. But as of right now, Portman’s claim -- that the ""disability fund is going belly up in 2016"" -- is accurate, or as accurate as Social Security’s trustees and the CBO can be.

Wisconsin DPI urged white students to wear ""white privilege"" wristbands, George Will says
","In mid-March 2013, an allegation surfaced in conservative circles that the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction encouraged white students to wear white wristbands to remind them about their white ""privilege."" The wristbands weren’t aimed at showing white supremacy, but rather as a reminder to the wearer of advantages that may come from being white. Neither the claim, nor a denial by the department, attracted much attention beyond blogs and websites. However, the matter took on a higher profile on April 3, 2013. Pulitzer Prize-winning writer George Will repeated the claim in his nationally syndicated column, saying the department ""urged white students to wear white wristbands 'as a reminder about your (white) privilege.’"" Is Will right? The column A regular commentator on ABC’s Sunday program ""This Week,"" Will is based at The Washington Post. His column is carried by some 400 newspapers, including the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The column citing the wristbands, headlined ""Schools push a curriculum of propaganda"" in The Post, begins with a reference to the Wisconsin Department of Public Instruction. DPI, the state agency for elementary and secondary education, isn’t run by the administration of Republican Gov. Scott Walker but by an independently elected and nonpartisan superintendent. The day before Will’s column was published, superintendent Tony Evers defeated a GOP lawmaker to win reelection. ""Wisconsin’s DPI, in collaboration with the Orwellian-named federal program VISTA (Volunteers in Service to America; the 'volunteers' are paid),"" Will wrote, ""urged white students to wear white wristbands 'as a reminder about your privilege, and as a personal commitment to explain why you wear the wristband.'"" Will cited an article about the wristbands by EAGNews.org, a website of the Education Action Group Foundation, a Michigan-based national organization that favors school choice and opposes public unions. The Michigan group’s article included a link to a flier mentioning the wristbands that was posted on the DPI website and distributed at a training class for DPI’s VISTA workers. Besides the wristbands, the flier also made other suggestions, such as putting a note ""on your mirror or computer screen as a reminder to think about privilege,"" Will noted. ""After criticism erupted,"" his column continued, ""the DPI removed the flyer from its website and posted a dishonest statement claiming that the wristbands were a hoax perpetrated by conservatives.’ But, again, the flyer DPI posted explicitly advocated the wristbands."" So, the claim from Will is about more than the existence -- even temporarily -- of a flier. His claim is that the department actively ""urged"" white students to wear the wristbands. Wristbands revealed The article by the Michigan group that revealed the flier carried a headline stating that ""Wisconsin education officials want students to wear ‘white privilege’ wristbands."" But the only evidence cited was the DPI web page that displayed the flier. DPI took down that page four days after the EAGNews.org article, but provided a copy to PolitiFact Wisconsin. The one-page flier was produced by the Beyond Diversity Resource Center in New Jersey, which says it ""teaches people to internalize the ethics and practices of true respect for cultural differences."" Headlined, ""Addressing Racial Privilege: A Mental Model for White Anti-Racists,"" the flier poses two dozen questions and suggestions aimed at making white people sensitive to advantages they may enjoy by being white. One of the suggestions is to wear a white wristband ""as a reminder about your privilege and as a personal commitment to explain why you wear the wristband."" The center said in late March 2013 it received ""hate mail and threatening phone calls"" since word of DPI’s use of the flier surfaced. DPI’s response We asked DPI spokesman John Johnson to respond to Will’s claim. He noted that Will had not contacted DPI; a Will researcher also did not reply to requests for information from PolitiFact Wisconsin. The VISTA workers cited in Will’s column -- there are 13 in Wisconsin who are paid $11,352 per year from federal funds -- work in the Milwaukee, Madison, Janesville, Beloit and Racine school districts, Johnson said. Their role is to develop ""family-school-community partnerships,"" according to the VISTA page on DPI’s website. Johnson said that in training, the VISTA workers were given a number of handouts, including the one that mentions the white wristbands, and the handouts were posted on a DPI web page. But DPI has never made any communication with any school or district about white wristbands and DPI is not aware of any schools that have such a program, he said. DPI took down the flier mentioning the wristbands from its website to make it clear there is no DPI-backed wristband program. In its place is a statement that says in part: ""First and foremost, and to be absolutely clear, no DPI official has asked, requested, or encouraged any school district, educator, or student to wear any wristband, and none of our VISTA volunteers have had any children put on any wristbands. To be clear, no Wisconsin students were given white wristbands."" So, although the wristbands idea was a small part of training materials given to VISTA workers, DPI was responsible for providing the information and posting the link on its web page, even if no instruction was given for carrying out a wristband program. But Will cites no evidence, and we’re not aware of any, to show that DPI promoted such a program to students. Our rating Will said DPI ""urged white students to wear white wristbands ’as a reminder about your (white) privilege.’"" DPI was responsible for a flier given to 13 federally paid workers that suggests white people consider wearing the white wristbands. But there is no evidence that DPI took any steps to urge students to wear the wristbands.

NARAL Virginia says 90 percent of health care policies cover abortion
","
The General Assembly on April 3 narrowly approved an amendment by Gov. Bob McDonnell that will ban insurers participating in an upcoming federal health care exchange in Virginia from offering policies that cover most abortions. 
The action was disappointing to NARAL Pro-Choice Virginia. The group said, among other things, that McDonnell’s proposal would force the exchange to offer more restrictive coverage than most private insurance plans. 
""McDonnell’s amendment prohibits Virginians participating in the new health exchange from purchasing any insurance plan that includes coverage for abortion -- coverage that currently exists as a standard benefit in nearly 90 percent of private plans sold in the U.S.,"" NARAL said in a March 26 news release. 
Two Democrats running for lieutenant governor -- state Sen. Ralph Northam of Norfolk and Aneesh Chopra, former U.S. chief technology officer of the United States -- quickly sent out similar statements. 
We decided to check NARAL’s claim that abortion coverage is standard in almost 90 percent of the private plans now being sold. We should note McDonnell’s amendment has an exception that allows insurance companies on the exchange to cover abortions in instances of rape, incest or when a mother’s life would be endangered by continuing a pregnancy. 
NARAL said it got the figure from a 2004 report by the Guttmacher Institute, an organization based in New York City that specializes in research on reproductive health issues. Although Guttmacher supports access to abortion and birth control, its research has been cited by both sides of the abortion debate. 
NARAL cited a Guttmacher synopsis that says the study examined abortion coverage through private insurance in 2002. It found that 87 percent of typical employer-based policies back then covered ""medically necessary or appropriate abortions."" 
Rebecca Wind, a spokeswoman for the Guttmacher Institute, said the definition of ""medically necessary or appropriate abortions"" is whatever a physician deems is required to protect the ""health or mental health of the patient."" 
Guttmacher said its figure on private insurance coverage for abortion did not consider plans that offered benefits only in limited circumstances such as cases of rape, incest or to protect  the life of a mother. 
But the Guttmacher memo also noted another survey examining the issue came up with different results. That study, by Kaiser Family Foundation, found in 2003 that 46 percent of workers with employer-based insurance had coverage for abortion. 
The Guttmacher and Kaiser studies conducted early last decade offer the only detailed looks available on abortion coverage. Experts have not reconciled the difference in results. 
We spoke to Jon Gabel, a researcher who helped compile the 2003 Kaiser survey and now is a senior fellow at NORC, a social science research foundation at the University of Chicago. He said the 46 percent Kaiser cited refers to workers who were covered  for ""elective abortions"" that did not involve a medical emergency. Gabel said he interpreted Guttmacher’s study as an examination of abortion coverage for medical necessity. 
Guttmacher, in a 2011 memo, essentially said the two studies asked different sets of questions that may have led to the different results. Guttmacher did not defend its original finding as definitive. ""The actual level of coverage is probably somewhere between the estimates made by Guttmacher and Kaiser, meaning that most Americans with employer-based insurance currently have coverage for abortion,"" the memo said. 
Our ruling 
NARAL said McDonnell’s amendment banning an upcoming health care exchange from offering insurance plans that include abortion denies Virginians ""coverage that currently exists as a standard benefit in nearly 90 percent of private plans sold in the U.S."" 
NARAL bases its claim on a 9-year-old study by the Guttmacher Institute that found 87 percent of typical of typical employer-based insurance policies covered ""medically necessary or appropriate abortions."" Contrary to NARAL’s contention, the findings do not reflect coverage ""that currently exists."" The research focused on policies that were offered in 2002. 
Guttmacher never updated its report. The only other major research on abortion coverage was conducted by Kaiser in early 2003 and produced a different result. It found that 46 percent of workers with employer-based insurance had coverage for abortions. 
Experts have struggled to reconcile the two numbers. Guttmacher, in 2011, said that the ""actual level of coverage is probably somewhere between"" its estimate and that of Kaiser. 
So NARAL is citing as gospel an old figure that even its authors undercut. We rate its claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/apr/15/naral-pro-choice-america/naral-virginia-says-90-percent-health-care-policie/

Congressman finds no humor in IRS Star Trek parody
","Video. The final frontier for some federal workers. A group of Internal Revenue Service employees went where few had gone before by creating a video in which they dressed as ""Star Trek"" characters. The video was intended for training purposes. When word got out about the video, particularly that tens of thousands of dollars were spent on it, many said the IRS workers should not have gone there. The critics included a Georgia congressman. ""Next time anyone (@barackobama) says they need to raise your taxes, send them this IRS star trek video -- cost you $60k,"" U.S. Rep. Tom Graves posted on his Twitter page. PolitiFact Georgia went on a mission to see whether the North Georgia Republican was correct. Thankfully, our search for the facts didn’t take as much time as Capt. Kirk, Mr. Spock and their crew spent on the Starship Enterprise. CBS News filed a federal Freedom of Information Act to get a copy of a 6-minute video of IRS employees in ""Star Trek"" gear decrying various tax evasion schemes. Here’s how the video began: ""Space: the final frontier These are the voyagers of the Starship Enterprise Y Its never-ending mission is to seek out new tax forms To explore strange new regulations To boldly go where no government employee has gone before."" The video ends with the crew heading from space back to Earth to pick up a ""tax gap vaccine."" Many news organizations quickly picked up on the story. The video was made in 2010. William Shatner, who starred as Capt. James T. Kirk in the television series, was not pleased about it. ""So I watched that IRS video. I am appalled at the utter waste of US tax dollars,"" Shatner posted on Twitter. This was not the only video. In 2011, some IRS workers dressed as characters from the campy 1960s television series ""Gilligan’s Island"" for another training video. Combined, the IRS said two videos cost $60,000. Couldn’t Thurston Howell III at least put up the money for the ""Gilligan’s Island"" video? Some news organizations, however, reported just the ""Star Trek"" video cost $60,000. Graves’ tweet did not mention the ""Gilligan’s Island"" video. PolitiFact Georgia contacted the congressman’s office to see whether it was aware of the other video. We were told the best person to talk to about it was Graves’ spokesman, John Donnelly, who was out of the country for a week and temporarily unavailable for comment. We caught up with Donnelly when he returned. He explained that the office saw some of the errant media reports and headlines and based its tweet on them. ""IRS admits $60,000 'Star Trek' parody video a mistake,"" was the headline of an NBCNews.com story. The article reported the existence of both videos and noted they cost a combined $60,000. The vast majority of news outlets reported $60,000 was spent on both videos. In a statement, Donnelly reiterated the congressman’s concerns about how taxpayer dollars were spent. ""The fact that the IRS used even 1 cent of someone’s hard-earned paycheck to make these bizarre videos is a horrific abuse of public funds and an embarrassing illustration of what happens when bureaucracies are bloated by billions of dollars in deficit spending,"" Donnelly said. ""Pause for a moment and consider that your tax dollars were used to pay for props like replica Spock ears, and think about how the IRS spent well over Georgia’s median household income to create these exorbitant spoofs -- it is absolutely shameful."" The IRS contends there was a cost benefit to the ""Gilligan’s Island"" video. The video ""was used to train taxpayer assistance employees in approximately 400 locations across the United States, saving an estimated $1.5 million as compared to the potential costs to train these employees in person,"" acting IRS Commissioner Steven T. Miller wrote in a letter to U.S. Rep. Charles Boustany, R-La., chairman of a House oversight subcommittee. Some news outlets reported that the ""Star Trek"" video cost more than the ""Gilligan’s Island"" video. The IRS did not respond to our follow-up question concerning the cost of each video. To sum up, Graves posted on Twitter that the IRS spent $60,000 on a training video in which some of its employees were dressed as ""Star Trek"" characters. The IRS says that video and another cost a combined $60,000. Graves’ statement was based on inaccurate news coverage. Most news organizations, though, got it right. The congressman’s claim is partially accurate. The IRS did spend a lot of taxpayer money on a ""Star Trek"" video. But Graves’ claim omits some important context, primarily that the $60,000 is inflated since that price tag covered two questionable videos.

Video says 28 percent of adults released from Rhode Island prisons are re-incarcerated within a year.
","
Rhode Island lawmakers recently heard testimony on a bill that would prohibit employers from asking job applicants if they have ever been convicted of a crime. 
The so-called ""ban-the-box"" legislation would bar employers from asking about a conviction history until ""after making a conditional offer of employment"" or ""determining that an applicant is a finalist."" 
Advocates for the bill, calling themselves Ban the Box RI, posted a six-minute film on YouTube supporting the legislation. It includes people who are identified only by their first names talking about how they had difficulty finding jobs after serving time in prison. 
State legislators and other officials who sponsored or support the proposal also make appearances. 
And A.T. Wall, the director of the Rhode Island Department of Corrections, appears and speaks in the film, although he told The Providence Journal after the film was released that he has taken no position on the bill. 
In the film, Wall describes what prisoners need to succeed when they re-enter society, noting the most important is employment. As he is speaking, a written statement appears on screen: ""In Rhode Island, 28 percent of adults released from state prisons are re-incarcerated within a year."" 
We wanted to see if that figure is accurate. Emmett FitzGerald, who helped make the movie, referred us to a Department of Corrections annual report. 
The department’s 2012 annual population report states that 3,387 offenders were released in calendar year 2009, a release group whose post-release statistics are being compiled over three years. ""Within 1 year of release 28% of offenders returned to RIDOC with a new sentence,"" the report says. 
PolitiFact Rhode Island also checked directly with the Department of Corrections to verify the number. Susan Lamkins, programming services officer, responded with a January 2013 document that said 31 percent of offenders released in 2009 returned to the state prisons under a new sentence within one year of release. 
Lamkins explained the difference in an e-mail:  ""Due to a slight change in methodology these numbers were updated in January to reflect the correct return rate percentage."" 
Whichever percentage one uses, both include parole and probation violators. The figures do not account for offenders who were released and later arrested on a new charge but were still awaiting trial. 
The Department of Corrections also provided in its report some comparison rates from four other New England states, but they were for different, and longer, periods after initial release from prison. 
Connecticut, for instance, had a 47-percent rate of offenders returning to prison within two years of release. (In Rhode Island, 42 percent returned to prison within 24 months of initially being released.) 
Other figures the Department of Corrections report cited were 43 percent for Massachusetts, 44.2 percent for New Hampshire and 52 percent for Vermont, but those were return-to-prison rates within three years of release. Rhode Island did not publish a three-year statistic. Year-three rates for the 2009 release group are slated to be published in the early summer, according to Lamkins. 
Our ruling 
The group Ban the Box RI, in its video says that ""in Rhode Island, 28 percent of adults released from state prisons are re-incarcerated within a year."" 
That was an accurate citation of a Department of Corrections figure at the time. 
The figure was revised to 31 percent -- close enough for us to rule True.

Somebody needs to stand up for the children of this state or they will continue to be killed, just like they were killed in Uvalde yesterday."" O'Rourke, who endorsed the mandatory buyback of military-style rifles when he ran for president in 2020, has continued to criticize pro-gun policies adopted by Texas' Republican leadership. On May 29, he tweeted, ""38,000 Texans had their license to carry denied, revoked, or suspended over the last five years because law enforcement deemed them too dangerous to carry a loaded gun in public. But thanks to Greg Abbott's new law, they don't need a license to carry anymore."" Is he right that people ""too dangerous to carry a loaded gun in public"" no longer need a license to carry? When we reached out for sources, O'Rourke's campaign pointed us to Texas Department of Public Safety data reports onlicense to carry applications denied, licenses revoked and licenses suspended. PolitiFact Texas contacted the Texas Department of Public Safety multiple times about permitless carry requirements but did not receive an answer. The campaign said the tweet was about House Bill 1927, one of many laws loosening gun restrictions that went into effect in 2021. That law allows people 21 years or older to carry a firearm without a license, except for those prohibited by federal and state law from possessing a firearm. The Department of Public Safety has data on licenses by calendar and fiscal year. When you add up the numbers for the past five fiscal years, there were nearly 35,000 licenses denied, suspended or revoked. In a follow-up phone call with O'Rourke's campaign, a spokesperson said the 38,000 statistic mistakenly encompasses six years, not five. For fiscal years 2016 to 2021, about 38,000 applications and licenses were denied, suspended or revoked.  So, O'Rourke's range of years was off by a year. PolitiFact Texas reached out to law experts to look at the second aspect of his claim: people who have had their handgun license denied, revoked or suspended now do not need a license to carry a handgun. Effective September 2021, the law no longer requires people to obtain a license to carry a concealed or holstered handgun in most public spaces in Texas. Obtaining a DPS-issued license requires applicants to pass a background check, complete a gun safety course, and meet specific eligibility requirements. HB 1927 stipulates, ""persons who are currently prohibited from possessing firearms under state and federal law will not gain the right to possess or carry a firearm under this legislation."" While it is accurate that people no longer need a license to carry, this part of the law is meant to prevent someone from carrying a gun who is barred by state or federal law from possessing a gun. Andi Turner, legislative director at the Texas State Rifle Association, pointed to this line in the law that prevents people ""deemed too dangerous"" from carrying a loaded handgun in public spaces. The law also defines who is prohibited from possessing a firearm, including people convicted of a felony or of certain assault offenses. HB 1927 and firearm possession law cover some of the same base eligibility requirements. Ari Freilich, state policy director at the Giffords Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence, said in an email that he believed O'Rourke's statement is accurate because HB 1927 made some people who previously could not qualify for a handgun carry permit newly eligible to carry guns in public because of gaps in the law. Before the permitless carry law took effect, some people could legally purchase a gun while being ineligible for a handgun carry permit, Freilich said. The Giffords Law Center gave three examples of this, documented in a 2019 report. For example, Freilich said, this would apply to an abusive partner threatening to shoot his spouse or child, as long as he didn't actually use or exhibit a firearm when threatening them. It is generally a Class C misdemeanor to intentionally or knowingly threaten another person, including a spouse or household member, with imminent bodily injury. But state prohibitions in firearm possession applies to felony and Class A misdemeanor assault convictions. Practically speaking, there is no longer a check on who is carrying because law enforcement can't legally require a license, Southern Methodist University law professor Eric Ruben said. ""The licensing process was a filter for weeding out who shouldn't otherwise carry handguns,"" Ruben said. ""And if someone was caught carrying a handgun, law enforcement would be able to ask, 'Do you have a license?' If a person didn't have a license, they'd be breaking the law."" Without being able to ask for a license, Ruben said, it will be hard to differentiate between someone who's lawfully carrying a gun or not. 
O'Rourke tweeted, ""38,000 Texans had their license to carry denied, revoked, or suspended over the last five years because law enforcement deemed them too dangerous to carry a loaded gun in public. But thanks to Greg Abbott's new law, they don't need a license to carry anymore."" O'Rourke tweeted the wrong number. It should have either been nearly 35,000 licenses denied, revoked, and suspended within the past five years or over 38,000 within the past six years. Though law enforcement is longer checking for licenses, the second part of O'Rourke's statement is an oversimplification. HB 1927 states, ""persons who are currently prohibited from possessing firearms under state and federal law will not gain the right to possess or carry a firearm under this legislation."" So, people ""too dangerous to carry a loaded gun"" would be kept from having one because of state and federal possession laws. But there are some gaps in the law, and keeping a statewide requirement for licenses would have made people meet more eligibility requirements.

In Pennsylvania Senate race, Mehmet Oz distorts John Fetterman’s stance on releasing prison inmates
","Attacking his election opponent as ""crazier than you think,"" Mehmet Oz tweeted an ad to his 3.8 million Twitter followers that made this claim: ""John Fetterman wants to release one-third of dangerous criminals back into our communities.""  John Fetterman on crime: crazier than you think. pic.twitter.com/0xmMnUU9fI Oz, a physician and former TV talk show host, is the Republican nominee for U.S. Senate in Pennsylvania. Fetterman, a Democrat, is the state’s lieutenant governor. The race, rated by campaign watchers as ""tilts Republican"" and a toss-up, could help decide which party controls the Senate, which is now split 50-50. Fetterman has touted work to increase the number of pardons issued to prison inmates in Pennsylvania and has called for reducing the prison population in other ways, but we did not find an instance of Fetterman calling for the release of one-third of dangerous criminals. In 2020, Fetterman twice highlighted what he said was a comment by Pennsylvania’s then-corrections secretary that the state could reduce its prison population by one-third without risking public safety. Oz tweeted his ad on July 18, the same day his team announced the ad was part of a ""Liberal-O-Meter"" campaign to highlight Fetterman’s ""radical policies and crazy statements.""  It’s not the first time he has made the claim. Oz said in a June 13 speech that Fetterman said, ""We should release one-third of all inmates, including violent offenders."" And in a video ad published on YouTube July 14, Oz said Fetterman ""supports releasing one-third of the prison population."" To back up the claim, Oz’s campaign referred PolitiFact to a June 22 article in the conservative-leaning Daily Caller and to two Fetterman tweets cited in the article. The article said Fetterman twice in 2020 ""appeared to endorse"" releasing one-third of the state’s prison population.  In May 2020, Fetterman tweeted: ""PA’s Correction Secretary has said: ‘We could reduce our prison population by 1/3 and not make anyone less safe.’"" And in July 2020, he tweeted: ""Our Corrections Secretary has said we could"" release ""1/3 of our inmates and not make anyone less safe. What if we directed those savings into our state schools?""  The corrections secretary was John Wetzel, who was appointed to the post in 2011 by Republican Gov. Tom Corbett. In announcing in September 2021 that Wetzel would leave the post, Gov. Tom Wolf, a Democrat, praised Wetzel for reducing the state’s prison population. PolitiFact searched Google, the Nexis news archive, and Wetzel’s Twitter account, and did not find an instance in which Wetzel made such a statement, so we asked Fetterman’s campaign about the Wetzel remarks. Spokesperson Joe Calvello responded that the campaign could not find the exact quote, but that Wetzel has made similar comments, such as in 2021, when Wetzel advocated for medical parole for elderly inmates, saying most who would be eligible ""are incapacitated and not a security threat."" Calvello said that Fetterman was not expressing an opinion on releasing one-third of its inmates but was citing Wetzel’s comments to highlight the cost of Pennsylvania’s prison system.  We tried to reach Wetzel via LinkedIn and his consultant agency on Facebook, but got no reply. Fetterman has called for ""second chances"" for offenders, such as eliminating mandatory life-without-parole sentences for certain murder convictions and for other criminal justice reforms. Fetterman’s campaign website includes one video promoting his record as lieutenant governor in increasing pardons for prison inmates in Pennsylvania; in the other video, Fetterman calls for overhauling the criminal justice system, saying, ""There are individuals that, quite frankly, don’t need to be in prison, it doesn’t make anyone more safe."" Pennsylvania ranked 25th among states in the number of people incarcerated in state prisons per 100,000 residents, based on 2019 U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics data, according to The Sentencing Project, a nonprofit that works to minimize imprisonment. Oz said Fetterman wants to release one-third of dangerous criminals back into our communities."" Fetterman has not called for releasing one-third of ""dangerous criminals."" In 2020, he twice highlighted what he said was a comment by Pennsylvania’s corrections secretary that the state’s prison population could be reduced by one-third without a risk to public safety. But Fetterman did not directly express an opinion on releasing prisoners and did not indicate he supported releasing dangerous ones. Oz’s statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression. We rate it Mostly False.

Michels on target with claim his company was building Keystone Pipeline when Biden ended it
","On his first day in office, President Joe Biden put the final nail in the coffin of the Keystone XL pipeline when he revoked its construction permit via an executive order. Several months later in June 2021, TC Energy Corporation announced the termination of the project, bringing an end to more than a decade of debate and legislative back-and-forth on it. The Keystone XL pipeline would have been an extension to the Keystone pipeline, an already existing structure that brings tar sands oil from Alberta, Canada to storage and distribution facilities in Cushing, Oklahoma and eventually to refineries in Texas. The extension would have boosted this by carrying an additional 830,000 barrels per day from Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. Environmental activists, Indigenous communities and climate change experts hailed Biden’s decision to cancel the pipeline, which could have damaged sacred sites, caused pollution and water contamination, imperiled wildlife and dramatically contributed to carbon emissions. But the decision was criticized heavily by many Republicans, including U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, former Vice President Mike Pence and – most recently – Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Tim Michels, who had a personal stake in it all. On June 23, 2022, Michels tweeted: ""My company was building the Keystone Pipeline when Biden canceled it. Both he and Tony Evers are making us all pay the price. I'll stand by Wisconsinites and ensure you keep more of your hard-earned dollars as your next governor."" He made another claim in a video posted with the tweet: ""Biden killed hundreds of jobs, sent gas prices way up, making everything more expensive."" We rated that Mostly False. Michels is the co-owner of Michels Corporation, an energy and infrastructure contractor headquartered in Brownsville, Wisconsin, with locations across the United States and Canada Was Michels Corp. building the Keystone XL pipeline when Biden canceled it?  In an email to PolitiFact Wisconsin, TC Energy confirmed that Michels Corp. had been awarded ""a significant construction scope"" on the Keystone XL pipeline for both the pipeline and facilities.  Michels Corp. provided more details in an email: ""Michels Pipeline, a Division of Michels Corporation, received a contract related to the Keystone XL pipeline to construct pumping stations. Michels Canada Co. received another contract in Canada to help build the mainline pipeline of the Keystone XL pipeline."" According to a post on Michels Corp.'s website from September 2020, Michels Corp. was awarded a contract from TC Energy to construct eight pump stations for the pipeline in Montana, South Dakota, Oklahoma and Texas.  Pump stations are facilities along a pipeline that maintain the flow and pressure of oil as it's being transported. They were one type of ancillary facility required for the Keystone XL project, which would have traversed through Montana, South Dakota and Nebraska. Oklahoma and Texas, however, are part of the existing Keystone pipeline structure, so some of the pump stations Michels Corp. was constructing may not have been for the Keystone XL pipeline. The post said that construction on the eight pump stations started in late June 2020 and was scheduled for completion in the first quarter of 2021. It also said the company would employ more than 350 workers at peak construction. According to a June 2020 post on Michels Canada’s website, Michels Canada was awarded a contract from TC Energy to construct approximately 260 kilometers (about 162 miles) of the pipeline in Alberta. A TC Energy fact sheet about the Canadian portion of the pipeline said it would be approximately 530 kilometers (about 329 miles) from Hardisty, Alberta, to Monchy, Saskatchewan. So Michels Canada would have constructed about half of the Canadian portion of the pipeline. The full pipeline was to run around 1,200 miles. So, Michels’ company was clearly a significant part of building the pipeline, but as stated readers might think it was the primary – or even sole – contractor. The post said that Michels Canada was projected to hire 1,000 workers each year of the two-year construction period, which was scheduled to begin the summer of 2020 near Oyen, AB, and finish in the spring of 2022 near Hardisty, AB. At the time Biden canceled the permit for the pipeline, on Jan. 20, 2021, Michels Corp.’s construction of eight pump stations in the U.S. was likely nearing completion. Michels Canada’s construction of its segment of the pipeline’s Canadian portion was likely about one-third complete. According to Reuters, only about 8% of the planned Keystone XL pipeline had been built by the time President Biden canceled the permit. In a tweet, Michels claimed his ""company was building the Keystone Pipeline when Biden canceled it."" The way it was stated could leave readers thinking his company was fully responsible for the pipeline. And some of the pump stations his campaign and company cited apparently are tied to the existing portion of the pipeline. So, there is a lack of precision there. But Michels is right that his company had a significant role in the pipeline project.

Like the Facebook post, the site doesn’t provide evidence on how it determined Zelenskyy’s net worth, salary and monthly income. It also claims, without proof, that Zelenskyy owns a dozen real estate properties and several luxury cars and yachts, and that he owns stock in companies like Apple, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. PolitiFact previously rated False a similar claim that said Zelenskyy owned a $35 million home in Florida and had an overseas bank account worth $1.2 billion. The claim came from a source that appeared to be backed by the Russian government. Zelenskyy does have some assets — or at least he did before becoming Ukraine’s president in 2019. A trove of financial documents called the Pandora Papers was made public in 2021 and detailed how the wealthy hide their assets through offshore tax havens and, in a few cases, money laundering. Zelenskyy and several associates oversaw multiple offshore companies, according to the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project, or OCCRP. People close to Zelenskyy used the companies to buy several expensive real estate properties in London. The papers didn't reveal how much money the companies held and made no references to Zelenskyy receiving $11 million a month, owning luxury yachts or holding stock in multiple tech companies. The documents did reveal that his assets included some cars and property, but it did not go into specifics. An April 2022 report by Forbes found that Zelenksyy's actual net worth is somewhere between $20 million to $30 million. The news outlet estimated that Zelenskyy has an $11 million stake in Kvartal 95, a television production company he helped start before his presidency. Forbes determined his real estate holdings were worth $4 million and made up of an apartment in Kyiv that he lives in, two apartments that he owns, two complexes that he co-owns and a piece of commercial property. Zelenskyy also has a shared bank account with his wife, first lady Olena Zelenska, that has about $2 million, plus two cars and a few pieces of jewelry that are worth less than $1 million combined, according to Forbes’ report. A Facebook post shared a screenshot from a website claiming to show Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy’s net worth as being $596 million while receiving a monthly income of $11 million and a salary of $780,000.

End of Keystone pipeline did cost jobs, but most were temporary
","After about a decade of gas prices declining overall, they have skyrocketed this year. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine on Feb. 24, 2022, gas prices rose sharply, peaking at $4.33 a gallon on March 11 before a slight decline. They then started rising again from late April through mid-June, when they reached a record $5.01 per gallon on June 13 before declining again. Tim Michels, a Republican running for governor in Wisconsin, had a novel approach to the blame game. He attributes the prices at the pump to President Joe Biden’s decision some 18 months ago to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline. In a video Michels tweeted on June 23, 2022, he said the decision ""killed hundreds of jobs, sent gas prices way up, making everything more expensive."" In the tweet itself, Michels wrote that his company ""was building the Keystone Pipeline when Biden canceled it"" — a claim we rated Mostly True. But what about the claim related to job losses and gas prices? Michels Corp., the construction company Michels co-owns, was awarded a contract to construct eight pump stations in the United States for the Keystone XL pipeline. It was also awarded a contract to construct about half of the Canadian portion of the pipeline in Alberta. So, he’s got a direct stake in the issue. Let’s start with the portion of the claim about hundreds of jobs lost. According to a post on Michels Corp.’s website, the company expected to employ more than 350 people for the pump stations contract. Another post on Michels Canada’s website said the company expected to hire 1,000 workers each year over the two-year construction period for the segment of the pipeline’s Canadian portion. Thus, Michels is on the money about the number of jobs involved. But it’s important to note that the jobs were temporary. A 2014 State Department report, which provides the most comprehensive estimate of jobs tied to the Keystone XL pipeline project, found that it would support 3,900 direct construction jobs in the United States over one year of construction, or 1,950 per year if construction took two years. Once construction was complete and the pipeline was operational, about 50 total employees were required in the United States: 35 permanent employees and 15 temporary contractors. Yes, a job is a job, but the fact that most of the jobs created by the Keystone XL pipeline project were short-term is an important detail that Michels left out. Now let’s look at the other, more problematic, half of the claim — that the end of the pipeline sent gas prices way up. In response to a request for backup, Chris Walker, an advisor to the Michels campaign, said ""obviously with gas prices nearly doubling in price since President Biden took office, the results of abandoning American energy production speak for themselves."" But gas prices did not begin to spike until late February 2022, over a year after the pipeline was canceled. What’s more, the pipeline was not expected to be operational until sometime in 2023 — many months from now. So, there are two major problems right there. Here’s one more: As envisioned, the pipeline would have had a negligible impact on the world’s oil supply once operational. And it’s important to remember that oil prices, and the gas prices that follow, are part of a global market. ""There’s just no connection there,"" said Gregory Nemet, a professor of public affairs and energy policy researcher at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, adding that rising gas prices are ""completely unrelated"" to Biden’s decision to cancel the Keystone XL pipeline. The main problem with Michels’ claim, Nemet said, is that the oil and gas markets are global, since oil is shipped around the world by pipelines, ships, and trains. As such, ""there’s really one global price for oil,"" he said. There’s some variation in different places, but that variation doesn’t last long. This is an important point, he said, because around 95 million barrels of oil get used per day. When the Keystone XL pipeline would have been completed, it would have moved a small fraction of that, having an impact of less than 1%. So what’s causing the rising gas prices?  According to Nemet, two main things: post-COVID-19 pandemic recovery and disruptions from Russia’s war in Ukraine. Transportation demand fell during the pandemic, and the supply of oil followed. The demand has now bounced back as people return to their prepandemic driving and flying habits, but the supply has been slower to rebound. Following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine in February, many countries stopped buying oil from Russia, one of the world’s largest oil producers. ""Again, because it’s a global market, disruptions far away affect the U.S. directly,"" Nemet said. Michels claimed that by canceling the Keystone XL pipeline, ""Biden killed hundreds of jobs (and) sent gas prices way up."" He has a point on the loss of jobs, but left out the fact that all but 35 would be temporary. He’s way off the mark, though, on the impact of the decision on today’s gas prices. Even if it had not been canceled, the pipeline would not be finished today. And if it were, its presence would have a negligible impact on the global oil market. Our definition for Mostly False is ""the statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression."" That’s what we rate this claim.",/factchecks/2022/jul/21/tim-michels/end-keystone-pipeline-did-cost-jobs-most-were-temp/

","Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and 16 other House Democrats were arrested during a July 19 rally outside the Supreme Court to protest the decision to overturn Roe v. Wade. The U.S. Capitol Police said the arrests were in connection with crowding, obstructing or incommoding after the protesters continued blocking a street despite three warnings from the police. Ocasio-Cortez and Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., posted photos of their arrest paperwork to their Instagram stories indicating that they had been ordered to pay $50 fines.

""I guess the attention wasn’t on them enough lately, so they decided to go out and get basically fake arrests."" ""Why would AOC be faking being arrested,"" said Graham Allen, a conservative podcaster and Turning Point USA contributor, in Twitter and Instagram posts shared after the arrests. ""Only to forget and then wave to people?! What kind of crazy is this?!""  Social media posts on Instagram and Telegram falsely claimed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez faked her arrest. The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Ocasio-Cortez was arrested, and there’s no evidence it was faked. She retweeted a video of the arrest taking place, and she said on her Instagram story that she would pay the fine in cash. Shortly after PolitiFact reached out to her office, the congresswoman addressed the allegation that she had staged the arrest in a post shared to her Instagram story. ""As for ‘faking arrest,’ that is also false,"" Ocasio-Cortez wrote. ""I was arrested, charged, and fined. Police confirmed this fact and I posted the paperwork.""

Jackie Speier, D-Calif., who was also arrested, confirmed to PolitiFact that the arrests were real and Ocasio-Cortez was among those arrested.  Cori Bush, D-Mo., shared a photo with Ocasio-Cortez on Twitter and wrote that ""they arrested us."" A freelance journalist also tweeted photos of Ocasio-Cortez being processed for her arrest, and several news organizations published reports detailing what happened. The claim that Ocasio-Cortez faked her arrest was an extension of a similar narrative that was spread by other conservative commentators and media outlets, such as the Post Millennial.  As the police escorted Ocasio-Cortez away, she walked at first with her hands crossed behind her back. Then she pumped a fist in the air. That change in posture led to accusations that she was pretending to be handcuffed for show at the beginning. (The U.S. Capitol Police told PolitiFact none of the demonstrators were handcuffed because the arrests were noncustodial.) But Ocasio-Cortez also addressed those allegations on her social media. ""Republicans’ favorite hobby is to make conspiracy theories out of everything to distract you and keep you from talking about what’s actually important, which is the fact that they are trying to take away your right to bodily autonomy,"" Ocasio-Cortez said in an Instagram story. ""If I was faking that, why would I intentionally fist pump somebody? It’s so silly."" ""Putting your hands behind your back is best practice when under arrest, whether you are handcuffed or not, because it can help prevent more serious charges like resisting arrest,"" she wrote in another Instagram story. She said the same on Twitter, adding, ""No faking here."" Ocasio-Cortez’s office declined to comment further. An Instagram post said Ocasio-Cortez was ""faking being arrested"" during an abortion-rights protest outside the Supreme Court. Ocasio-Cortez’s arrest was not faked; it took place on video and was corroborated by news reports, social media postings and the offices of other lawmakers who were arrested alongside her. Ocasio-Cortez called the claim ""false."" We rate this post False.",/factchecks/2022/jul/20/instagram-posts/no-alexandria-ocasio-cortez-did-not-fake-her-arres/

Plymouth Rock pictures don’t prove sea levels are the same as 1620
","Legend has it that, upon arriving in North America, the Pilgrims stepped off the Mayflower onto the large boulder that now sits in a place of prominence on the Plymouth, Massachusetts, waterfront.  Plymouth Rock is a well-known tourist attraction, but its connection to early U.S. history is unproven. And despite what some social media users have claimed, the landmark cannot be used to disprove that sea levels are rising. An Instagram user shared a July 17 meme about the rock that read, ""Plymouth Rock, 2022 still at sea level.""  On July 12, a Facebook user shared another meme featuring two pictures of Plymouth Rock side by side, one labeled ""1620 at sea level"" and the other ""2022 still at sea level.""  (Screengrab from Facebook.) The posts were flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) These Plymouth Rock memes do not prove that sea levels remain unchanged; the posts are false and misleading. There is no evidence the rock proudly displayed under the portico in Plymouth today is the exact place where Pilgrims first disembarked the Mayflower in Plymouth, much less that it was found at sea level. (The Pilgrims first landed in Provincetown, Massachusetts, on Nov. 11, 1620. The Mayflower anchored in Plymouth Harbor a few weeks later.) There are two primary accounts of the Pilgrims’ Plymouth landing, but ""both simply say that the Pilgrims landed. Neither mentions any rocks in their account of the landing,"" said Plymouth’s Pilgrim Hall Museum’s website. ""The first references to Plymouth Rock are found over 100 years after the actual landing."" The National Museum of American History site refers to the story of the Pilgrims landing at Plymouth Rock as ""oral tradition,"" and said no contemporary accounts of the landing mention a rock. Plymouth’s tourism website said in 1741 an elder identified Plymouth Rock as the exact landing spot. Although the veracity of the elder’s claim is unknown, Plymouth Rock ""quickly became an American icon,"" the site added.  Visitors stand in a pavilion while looking at Plymouth Rock, in Plymouth, Massachusetts, on Nov. 18, 2018. (AP) Once the boulder was identified as Plymouth Rock, its nomadic history began. ""In 1774, a team attempted to move the rock from shore and place it next to Plymouth’s liberty pole in the town square,"" said the National Museum of American History. ""Before it could be removed from the beach, it accidentally broke in two.""  One part of the rock remained in place; the other piece was moved to the town square.  More than 100 years later in 1880, ""the two pieces were reunited back on the shore and cemented together,"" the National Museum of American History said. In most images of the rock, it is easy to see where it was fused back together. Pilgrim Hall Museum’s website said ""1620"" was also cut into Plymouth Rock in 1880.  In 1920, the rock was moved again, when Plymouth’s waterfront was redesigned and the shoreline was rebuilt, according to Pilgrim Hall Museum’s site. The rock has also been underwater before, during extreme weather and exceptionally high tides called king tides.

Pilgrims would have got their feet wet landing on #PlymouthRock today. @ericfisher @Plymouth_400 pic.twitter.com/DxgQQXxu3J Furthermore, experts said the rock is not a useful landmark for measuring sea level changes. Michael Oppenheimer, a Princeton University professor of geosciences and international affairs, said a single, stationary object ""anchored in bedrock and free of tectonic activity"" can sometimes be used to measure local sea levels.  ""But all it can indicate is local sea level, not ‘sea levels’ generally or the global mean rise,"" Oppenheimer said. Local sea level rise can significantly differ from the global mean sea level rise because of land sinking or tectonic activity, he said.  Gary Griggs, a University of California, Santa Cruz, professor of earth sciences, said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has been tracking sea levels relative to land in Boston, near Plymouth Rock, for 100 years. These records show that sea levels have risen about 11.4 inches in the past century.  Satellite data, which has been used to measure sea level rise since 1993, indicates an average rate of global sea level rise of about 13.9 inches per century, Griggs said. That rate is accelerating; over the past decade, the rate has increased to about 19.7 inches per 100 years, he said. ""This is relatively simple science, and there are no alternate interpretations or facts,"" Griggs said. ""Sea-level rise is directly connected to a warming climate. The warmer the planet gets, the more sea water expands, and the more ice melts, all adding to sea level."" Oppenheimer also said global mean sea levels are rising annually and that the rise is accelerating. ""There is no doubt about this,"" he said. Rising sea levels cause problems, some of which have already begun, Oppenheimer said.  ""So-called nuisance or fair-weather flooding has increased in frequency, meaning that high tides now flood streets on a regular basis along the coast in many states — up to 10 times as frequently as 50 years ago,"" he said. ""Furthermore, in large coastal storms, flood risk is increasing as water penetrates inland further and to higher elevation."" There’s no proof that Plymouth Rock was at sea level when it might have welcomed the Pilgrims in 1620. The rock has also moved several times in the past 400 years and is sometimes submerged during high tides and extreme weather. Experts said that Plymouth Rock is not useful for evaluating sea level changes. That sea levels are rising, however, is undisputed.  We rate this claim False.

Zach Nunn falsely claims Cindy Axne sought to defund police
","Defunding the police has been a divisive topic among Democrats during the 2022 election cycle, although the Pew Research Center reported that, as of September 2021, only 25% of respondents who identified as Democrats supported decreasing police funding. It’s no different for elected Democrats. While progressives like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York have spoken in favor of reducing police funding and putting money into community programs for victim support and compensation funds, others, like Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey have sided with the majority of Democrats wanting police funding to increase or stay the same. ""My opponent, Cindy Axne, has actively sought to defund the police.""  Nunn went on to say Axne signed a pledge to reduce police funding in order to receive money from Ocasio-Cortez’s Courage to Change political action committee. In an interview with PolitiFact Iowa, Axne said that $5,000 Courage to Change PAC contribution to her campaign was sent without her knowledge and that she made no pledge of any kind beforehand. ""I never in my life have seen a pledge from her. And if I even had ever seen one, I would have never signed it,"" Axne said. Furthermore, Axne has sponsored multiple bills seeking to increase police funding. Such bills include the VICTIM Act, the Invest to Protect Act, and the Pathways to Policing Act — all of which were introduced after Axne received the contribution from Ocasio-Cortez’s Courage to Change PAC. The bills have not yet been voted on by the full House or Senate. Lauren Hitt, Ocasio-Cortez’s communications director, confirmed in an email to PolitiFact Iowa that Axne did not sign a pledge before or after receiving her donation from the Ocasio-Cortez PAC. ""Only the people listed at couragetochangepac.org/distinctions completed a questionnaire, in association with their endorsement or receipt of funding. Rep. Axne is not on the list,"" Hitt wrote. Our check of the website with the aid of the internet archive, Wayback Machine, shows that Axne never was listed as an endorsee. Our research shows that while Ocasio-Cortez’s PAC includes a questionnaire, on which candidates are asked if they will push for legislation to reduce police funding, Axne received her $5,000 contribution from the PAC on March 29, 2021, without filling out a questionnaire or pledging to reduce police funding. Meanwhile, the Pathways to Policing Act, introduced in May 2022, would give $50 million each year from fiscals 2023 thjrough 2027 to help state and local law enforcement recruit new members. The bill is pending in the House Judiciary Committee. The Invest to Protect Act was introduced in January 2022 to assist local police departments with fewer than 200 employees by providing training, enhancing recruitment, and providing officers with access to mental health therapy. The bill authorizes up to $50 million annually in fiscals 2022 through 2026. The bill also is pending in the House Judiciary Committee.  The VICTIM Act would provide $100 million in grants annually from fiscals 2023 through 2032. The grants would be for training, hiring, and the acquisition of new data processing technology for state, tribal, and local police departments. That bill passed out of the House Judiciary Committee in June on a 25-14 vote. Congressional records show that Axne also voted in favor of appropriations packages for fiscal years 2019 through 2022 that increased funding for local and federal law enforcement programs, agencies, and departments, each by hundreds of millions of dollars. The Courage to Change PAC made donations to 28 congressional candidates in March 2021 in addition to Axne. One of them was Rep. Mike Levin of California, who received a $5,000 contribution on the same day as Axne. Eric Mee, the congressman’s communications director, wrote in an email to PolitiFact Iowa that Levin didn’t make any pledge to defund the police either. Rep. Jared Golden of Maine, who received $5,000 on March 30, 2021, and Rep. Tom O’Halleran of Arizona, who received a donation on March 31, 2021, also made no pledge for the contribution, their spokespersons told PolitiFact Iowa. Lydia Hall, a spokesperson for Nunn, wrote in an email that if Axne wouldn’t have taken Courage to Change’s $5,000 if she really opposed reducing police funding. ""Cindy Axne voted for legislation that defunds police and is bankrolled by some of the loudest voices in the movement to defund police,"" Hall wrote to PolitiFact Iowa. The legislation to which Hall refers includes the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, which several Republicans have said effectively defunds police by forcing them to spend money on unfunded mandates instead of regular duties. The bill would not reduce police funding, but require departments to put money into training and resources and apply for grants to pay for resources. Although the bill would offer grants to state, local, and tribal police departments, Phillip L. Swagel, director of the nonpartisan U.S. Congressional Budget Office, wrote that the training and technology would cost police departments more than the $85 million allowed for unfunded mandates in 2021 under the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act. The bill, pending Senate action and which Axne supported in a March 2021 House vote, would require state, local, and tribal police officers to complete training on racial profiling, implicit bias, and the duty to intervene when another officer uses excessive force. It also would require the creation of the National Police Misconduct Registry to compile data and collect records on police misconduct. Zach Nunn said in a Breitbart interview that Cindy Axne actively sought to defund the police, saying that she signed a pledge to reduce police funding to receive money from Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Courage to Change political action committee. But the facts don’t back up the claim. Axne did not sign any pledge before or after receiving the donation and has voted for and cosponsored several bills that increase police funding.

Benandryl won’t relieve swelling from rattlesnake bites
","A Facebook post from 2019 claiming Benadryl can help treat rattlesnake bites has found new life recently as the longer summer days means more people spending time outdoors.   The July 2, 2019 post said the information is from ""someone in the know"" and recounts a story about a man who was bitten by a rattlesnake and taken to a hospital for treatment. ""By the time he got there his arm was starting to swell to the shoulder and his throat was getting tight,"" the post said. ""The first thing the emergency room did was give him Benadryl. Apparently antivenom must be received within four hours of the snake bite, but the immediate threat is swelling and death of tissue, which was treated with the Benadryl."" The swelling in the man's arm and throat immediately eased after he received the Benadryl, according to the post. The post encourages people to carry Benadryl with them as a treatment for a rattlesnake bite in case they or someone they know gets bitten. A similar post on Facebook from 2019 has also recently been shared again.  However good these posts’ intentions might be, they go against wildlife and medical experts’ recommendations for how to treat rattlesnake bites. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Benadryl is the brand name for diphenhydramine, a type of antihistamine used to treat runny noses, sneezing and red, itchy, watery eyes caused by allergies and common colds. It is also used to treat throat and airway irritations. Unlike venom from bee stings, which cause the body to release histamines and can be treated with Benadryl, snakebite venom works differently, according to the Snakebite Foundation, a nonprofit group composed of doctors, paramedics and scientists. A rattlesnake’s venom contains compounds that cause tissue necrosis, paralysis, blood coagulation and, in some cases, death. It does not make cells in the body release histamine.   Although rattlesnakes typically avoid people, around 8,000 people in the United States are bitten each year with about five cases ending in death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. A small number of incidents are ""dry bites,"" in which no venom is introduced into the body. A majority of bites happen by accident, usually when someone is walking or climbing and inadvertently touches a snake. Bite marks are typically found on someone’s hands, feet or ankles. Most of these snakebites happen from April to October, when snakes and people are most active outside, the U.S. Forest Service said. Dr. Nick Brandehoff, the Snakebite Foundation’s medical director and an assistant clinical professor of emergency medicine at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, said in a blog post that anithistamines like Benadryl won’t relieve swelling from snakebites because it’s not caused by an allergic reaction. Rattlesnake venom causes dying cells to release ""intracellular contents"" into the body, which prompts the swelling. Bites can also damage blood vessels, which causes blood plasma to leak into tissues and can lead to swelling. Allergic reactions do occur from snakebites, but Brandehoff said those are rare. The main treatment for a snakebite-triggered allergic reaction would be epinephrine, with Benadryl used only as a supplement to help ""keep the allergic reaction from rebounding."" ""In short, Benadryl is not effective for snake envenomations in humans or other animals,"" Brandehoff said. ""Antivenom along with proper supportive care are the only effective treatments supported by peer-reviewed literature."" The Forest Service recommends anyone who is snakebitten to seek immediate medical attention. Bite victims should not be given anything to eat or drink, including medication, until cleared by a medical professional. Antivenin, also known as antivenom, is made by extracting venom from a snake and injecting it in small doses into an animal, like a horse or rabbit, until that animal can produce enough specific antibodies to fight off the venom. Each snake species will have its own antivenin. Antivenin is the only available drug treatment effective for people suffering from venomous snakebites. Only a small number of patients bitten by snakes will need antivenin, which can cause severe allergic reactions, is in short supply and is effective only if doctors know which kind of snake inflicted the bite. A Facebook post said Benadryl can help treat rattlesnake bites by reducing the swelling they cause.  Medical and wildlife professionals say Benadryl is ineffective against bites because antihistamines can’t counteract snake venom.  Benadryl can provide some relief if someone suffers an allergic reaction from a snakebite, but only as a supplemental treatment and only in rare cases.The only drug effective in treating venomous snake bites is antivenin, also known as antivenom.

Democratic U.S. Senate candidate says 54% of people in Wisconsin lack accessible child care
","Wisconsin families are facing a child care crisis.  During the worst of COVID, a wave of child care facilities closed, some for good, and Bureau of Labor Statistics jobs data indicates childcare employment is still recovering from the pandemic.   Wisconsin State Treasurer Sarah Godlewski, a Democratic U.S. Senate hopeful, has taken up the pain felt by mothers across the state as she tries to appeal to working families.  ""Fifty-four percent of Wisconsinites live in a child care desert, full-time daycare can cost as much as college tuition, and our country is the only industrialized nation without paid family leave,"" Godlewski wrote in a recent opinion piece in the CapTimes on May 8, 2022.  It’s true the U.S. does not guarantee parental leave. And multiple studies have found the average cost of daycare in Wisconsin can cost as much as in-state tuition at a University of Wisconsin school, according to the Economic Policy Institute.  But, that 54% figure sticks out and will be the focus of this fact-check: Do more than half of the state’s residents live without ready access to child care?  And what does the definition of a ""child care desert"" in the study cited by Godlewski include — and what does it leave out? When asked for backup, Godlewski’s campaign pointed to research from Rasheed Malik, director of early childhood policy at the progressive think tank Center for American Progress, which found 54% of Wisconsinites live in a childcare desert.  The Center for American Progress has produced regular reports on child care access in the United States and operates childcaredeserts.org, which displays child care access, or the lack thereof, as a heatmap of the United States.  Malik’s team compiled data on child care facilities in each state from regulators and then paired the information with U.S. Census tract-level data on the number of children in a specific geographic area. If there were there more than three children for each slot in a census tract for preschool children, a widely used threshold, it received a ""desert"" classification. Malik said he views the figure as a conservative estimate, since some facilities may be licensed for more slots then they have the staff to support. That is, licensing for 60, but staffing for 40. In other words, the picture could be worse. But the picture itself is a narrow one, and that creates limitations on what Godlewski and others can realistically glean from the data. For instance, the approach does not take into account those who rely on child care through family, friends and neighbors. Such arrangements are not easily tracked. (And a 2013 census report indicated as much as one-third of preschool-age children received care through non-licensed providers.) Likewise, the approach does not account for school-based programs, such as prekindergarten programs that have care before or after classes. That information was not included in the analysis because it is held by a different agency, if it is kept at all. So, as both examples underline, the approach counts at least some children who already have care when it tallies how much care is needed in each area to avoid a desert designation. At the same time, there are other nuances not captured by the data: For instance, there may be a need for child care in the evenings or during third shift and no licensed facilities open at those times. Likewise, most people live in one census tract and work in another — or, especially in densely populated areas, may be able to easily find care in a neighboring one. Even if they do, the picture remains skewed. Elizabeth Davis, professor of applied economics at the University of Minnesota, said a gradient — instead of a numerical threshold — would better reflect nuances in child care access. But such an approach would be much harder to create, especially on a national level, given that states track and report data differently. Experts we talked to said the limitations are understandable: The research is a bit of a patchwork because the nation’s child care system is a patchwork. ""These data points should be a jumping-off point for communities to discuss demand and supply issues,"" Davis said. For our fact-checking purposes, Godlewski is accurately quoting a report — but she states research that has a host of limitations and caveats as a flat-out fact. That’s problematic, since many listeners likely hear ""child care desert"" as no available care — not as ""limited access when looking only at only one piece of the puzzle."" Godlewski said 54% of people in Wisconsin live in child care deserts, referencing studies from the progressive think tank Center for American Progress. The study is recognized as one of the best available, but its methodology provides only a piece of the overall picture. And in distilling a complex, decentralized system into a neat, tidy percentage to tell a story, context and nuance are lost.  We rate this claim Mostly True. ",/factchecks/2022/jul/20/sarah-godlewski/democratic-us-senate-candidate-says-54-people-wisc/

No, third-grade reading scores are not being used to plan for how much space is needed in prisons
","Typically, standardized test scores are used to measure how well students have grasped what they’ve been taught over the school year. But an old claim suggests that something sinister is happening with those scores behind the scenes.  ""Did you know that third grade reading scores in the USA help correctional institutions predict how many beds they’ll need in the future,"" read the text on an Instagram post. ""So rather than helping these babies, they just begin planning for incarceration. Welcome to America."" The Instagram post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Old rumors like this one die hard — politicians and others have repeated the claim throughout the years. But widespread sharing doesn’t make it true. We’ve fact-checked it before.  A U.S. Department of Education spokesperson told PolitiFact, ""This does not appear to be true, at least at the federal level. We’re not aware of any instance in which the U.S. Department of Education has ever partnered with correctional institutions to determine, based on test scores, how much capacity in prisons will be needed in the future."" We reported in 2013 that private prisons use inmate projections from state governments, not third-grade reading scores; the same is true now. Alex Wilkes, a spokeswoman from Day 1 Alliance, a trade association representing the prison corporations CoreCivic, The GEO Group, MTC and LaSalle Corrections, told PolitiFact that the claim was ""total nonsense.""  ""This is just another ridiculous example of the prominent role that misinformation plays in this debate and how some repeat these lies for years on end,"" Wilkes said. ""Contractors are subjected to multiple layers of oversight, from health agencies to independent auditors, including on-site government monitors who work inside our members’ facilities to hold them accountable to the contract.""  As an example of the type of statistics used to determine future space in prisons, the Florida Department of Corrections pointed PolitiFact to reports from the Office of Economic and Demographic Research. A report from the Criminal Justice Estimating Conference, which met on Jan. 13, 2022, shows Florida Corrections officials lowered their estimates for the number of future inmates based on the COVID-19 pandemic’s impact in 2021. The Florida Corrections Department saw a reduced number of felony arrests, a decreased  intake of inmates because of staffing shortages and an increased backlog in cases — and because of this, the department lowered its projections for inmate admissions and populations for 2022. ""While there is upward pressure on admissions as the courts continue to process their backlog of pending felony cases and DOC works to clear their recent backlog, the reduced number of felony arrests are exerting enough downward pressure that admissions numbers are expected to lower admissions for the foreseeable future,"" the report read.  PolitiFact also contacted Peter Leone,  who directed the National Center on Education, Disability and Juvenile Justice, which published a report during its operation from 1999 to 2006 that said in part, ""​​At least one state uses reading achievement levels of students in the third grade as a basis for projecting the number of future prison beds needed."" But Leone set the record straight for us in 2013: That sentence in the report had been included by a colleague before he got the facts, Leone said. Today, Leone, a professor emeritus of special education at the University of Maryland who specializes in behavioral disorders and school discipline, said the claim is still wrong, and there’s no study that can support it.  ""There’s just no truth to it. And no one I’ve ever talked to has been able to produce a study, a paper, (or) someone (who) will go on the record and say, ‘Yeah, actually that’s what we used to do. That’s what we did.’ It’s just nothing there."" So why doesn’t the claim die? Leone said it’s likely because it’s catchy. Reports have shown that people including Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell, Terry McAuliffe and others have often repeated the statement. Prison corporations are not looking at third-grade test scores to plan for the future, and low reading scores alone do not mean that children are likely to go to prison when they’re older. But, Leone said, children who face difficulties such as low literacy, misbehavior or absences in school, or trouble in their homes or communities could be more likely to get in trouble with the justice system. ""The nexus is not a clear cause-and-effect relationship,"" Leone said. ""Rather, it’s a cluster of vulnerabilities that include poverty, race, low literacy levels, it’s a whole bunch of things. And that’s what makes those kids more vulnerable to the justice system."" An Instagram post touted the claim that correctional institutions research third-grade reading scores to help them determine how many beds will be needed in the future.  The claim is years-old and false. Experts and reports have shown that there is no evidence to support it. Private prisons use inmate projections from state governments, not third-grade reading scores to plan for the future.

No, video of rioters discussing Capitol ‘floor plan’ doesn’t prove Jan. 6 was antifa setup
","False claims blaming antifa activists for the violence at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, took off as soon as former President Donald Trump’s supporters stormed the building.  More than a year and a half later, those claims continue to spread online — despite having been thoroughly debunked. ""Antifa was already inside the Capitol with floor plans dressed as Trump supporters,"" said the text over a viral Facebook post shared July 15. ""This was 100% a setup.""

One voice can be heard asking, ""What’s the floor plan?"" Another says, ""We just need a plan. We need enough people. We need to push forward."" Speaking into a bullhorn through a broken window, a woman is captured on the video shouting instructions to the rioters inside. She tells them in detail about the layout of an adjacent room in the Capitol and urges them to ""coordinate together if you are going to take this building."" Contrary to what the Facebook post claims, there is no evidence that the rioters in the video were ""already"" positioned inside the Capitol before the attack began. Separate footage captured from the same part of the Capitol shows several rioters climbing inside the room through the broken window before and after one rioter yells the expression heard on the Facebook video: ""We just need a plan. We need enough people. We need to push forward."" The video also does not show a ""setup"" by members of antifa. Antifa is a loosely organized coalition of anti-fascist left-wing activists commonly scapegoated for domestic unrest. The Chicago Project on Security and Threats, a group at the University of Chicago, has examined the cases of more than 900 people who had been charged with crimes relating to the attack. The team has found ""no evidence"" of antifa involvement, research director Keven Ruby told PolitiFact. That has not wavered since FBI assistant director Steven D’Antuono said two days after the attack that the agency had ""no indication"" that antifa played a role. PolitiFact could not identify all the rioters in the Facebook post’s video. But the faces in the video included known Trump supporters such as Mariposa Castro of California, whose social media activity indicated that she was a fan of Trump’s, according to court documents. Castro had attended Trump rallies, and her attorney said she went to Washington to support Trump. She pleaded guilty to one count of parading, demonstrating or picketing in the Capitol. She was sentenced in February to 45 days in prison and a $5,000 fine. Court documents say Castro attended Trump’s rally at the White House Ellipse. Later, after seeing news reports from her hotel of the chaos outside the Capitol, she went to the building and climbed inside through the broken window; she was not ""already"" inside before the attack started. The woman seen in the Facebook video shouting directions to ""coordinate"" through a bullhorn is Rachel Powell of Pennsylvania, who started embracing Trump during his presidency and voted for him in 2020, she told The New Yorker.

There was a more recent case of a woman impersonating a nurse and trying to kidnap an infant in the United States, according to authorities in Riverside County, California, but it does not appear to be related to the incident described in this Facebook image. On July 14, two days after this Facebook post was published, a woman entered a hospital there posing as a newly hired nurse, the Los Angeles Times reported. She tried to take the infant and then fled, but was later arrested, the sheriff’s office said. Posts that recycle an old image from the Philippines and claim that it shows a woman who is currently wanted in the U.S. for kidnapping from a hospital are wrong. We rate them False.",/factchecks/2022/jul/19/viral-image/no-woman-isnt-wanted-impersonating-nurse-and-kidna/

No, un artículo del London Times no alegó que la vacuna contra la viruela del mono provocó el sida
","Un usuario publicó en Facebook una imagen de la portada del London Times en 1987 alegando que un artículo decía que la vacuna contra la viruela del mono causó el sida en África. ""El 11 de mayo de 1987, el London Times informó en su portada: ‘La OMS entregó 50 millones de vacunas contra la viruela del mono, estas provocaron el sida a los africanos"", dice la publicación.  El post fue marcado como parte del esfuerzo de Facebook para combatir las noticias falsas y la desinformación en su plataforma. (Lea más sobre nuestra colaboración con Facebook.) La viruela del mono ha sido detectada en 14 países incluyendo los Estados Unidos;  1,814 casos han sido encontrados en Estados Unidos, según el Centro para el Control y Prevención de Enfermedades. El Departamento de Salud y Servicios Humanos anunció el 1 de julio la distribución de 2.5 millones de vacunas contra la viruela de mono para desacelerar el brote.   PolitiFact encontró el artículo original del London Times, al que la publicación de Facebook hace referencia, en el cual el medio relacionaba la vacunación contra la viruela común con la propagación del VIH, no la vacuna contra la viruela del mono. Aún así, no hay evidencia de que la vacuna contra la viruela común cause el sida.  El artículo del London Times señala que la Organización Mundial de la Salud estaba estudiando "" nueva evidencia científica que sugiere que la inmunización con la vacuna contra la viruela Vaccinia activaba la infección por el virus de la inmunodeficiencia humana (VIH)"".  La publicación Irish Independent publicó un artículo el 12 de mayo de 1987 que descarta la teoría como una ""especulación extraña"".  ""Los científicos dijeron que la teoría no tiene más fundamento que las historias que sugieren que la enfermedad se creó en un laboratorio estadounidense o vino del espacio exterior"", dice el artículo.  La Organización Mundial de la Salud reafirmó en un correo electrónico a PolitiFact que ""no están al tanto"" de la teoría presentada en el artículo del London Times.  Los primeros casos del VIH fueron detectados en África central en la década de los 80 y fueron transmitidos de los monos a los humanos. Actualmente no existe evidencia de que la vacuna contra la viruela común cause el sida. Una publicación en Facebook muestra una portada del London Times de 1987 y alega que el artículo dice que la vacuna contra la viruela del mono causó el sida en África.  Eso no es cierto.  El artículo del London Times alega que la vacuna contra la viruela común — no la vacuna contra la viruela del mono — causó el sida.  Aún así, no hay evidencia de que la vacuna contra la viruela común ocasione el sida.    Calificamos la publicación como Falsa.
