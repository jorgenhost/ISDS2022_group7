U.S. Sen. Isakson claims competition driving cost for Medicare prescription drug benefit down
","
Free-market believers hold the concept as dearly as an article of faith: Competition brings down prices.

So when U.S. Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican, declared that competition worked to bring down costs in Medicare’s prescription drug program, he was reciting chapter and verse from the free-market canon.

Program premiums served as Isakson’s evidence.

""The premium has gone down almost every year since it was put in place,"" Isakson said in a speech before the Greater North Fulton Chamber of Commerce on Aug. 23.

Almost every year? We wondered how this was possible. What about all of those complaints about the rising costs of prescription drugs?

Medicare Part D, which started in 2006, is Medicare’s program to help seniors pay for prescription drugs. Policymakers designed it to make private companies compete against one another for customers. They hoped this would pressure plans to keep prices low.  

Isakson voted to create Medicare Part D in 2003, while he served in the U.S. House of Representatives.

This item does not address whether competition caused changes in the program’s premiums.  Instead, we’ll focus on whether premiums went down.

Now, hold on to your hat. This gets complicated.

We contacted Isakson’s office for proof that the premium has fallen almost every year.

Isakson press secretary Lauren Culbertson replied with a March 2011 report from the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or MedPac. It advises the U.S. Congress on issues affecting the Medicare program. She also included information from the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, the federal agency that administers the Medicare program.

These documents contain data for what’s called Medicare Part D’s ""base beneficiary premium.""

The ""base beneficiary premium"" is a complicated number. It’s not the actual monthly amount that seniors pay to get basic coverage under the prescription drug program. Those amounts vary widely and seldom equal this figure, the CMS report notes.  

Medicare calculates the base beneficiary premium using a formula that takes many factors into account. One of them is how much each insurance company bids to provide drug coverage. Another is how many people use each plan.  

The data Isakson’s own staff sent us show that the base beneficiary premium actually increased almost every year, with the exceptions of 2007 and projections for 2012.

In 2006, it was $32.20. In 2007, $27.35;  in 2008, $27.93; in 2009, $30.36; in 2010, $31.94; in 2011, $32.34. In 2012, it’s projected to be $31.08.

Boston University health care economist Wesley Yin called Isakson’s claim that the premiums mostly fell ""patently wrong.""

Culbertson, in an email, told us why Isakson made this claim. She said that the senator’s comments were based on the fact that for every year except 2011, the base beneficiary premium was lower than it was in 2006.

That’s not quite what we think Isakson said, but to give him the benefit of the doubt, we took a closer look.

As it turns out, this claim is flawed as well. Since 2007, the federal government has adjusted the base beneficiary premium based on how many participants enroll in each plan. This means that a plan with a $20 premium that has 1,000 members would have much more influence on the average than, say, a $200 plan with one member.

In 2006, the program was brand-new. That year’s figure could not be weighted by enrollment. The MedPac report given to us by Isakson’s office as well as a report from the Congressional Research Service confirmed that these plans were, for the most part, weighted equally.

This pushed the 2006 figure artificially high, noted Jack Hoadley, a Georgetown University health policy analyst whose research on Medicare Part D is widely used by economists. Since few people picked the higher-price plans, the base beneficiary premium dropped in 2007.

Now, as you’ll recall, the base beneficiary premium does not represent how much money seniors actually pay each month. Hoadley and a team from the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation calculated this amount and found that premiums rose each year. In 2006, it was $25.93. In 2010, the latest year for which data is available, it was $36.90.

That’s an increase of 42 percent.

Why did prices creep upward? Hoadley, MedPac and others cite a couple of reasons. Seniors typically stay in their plans, even if they become more expensive. Switching is complicated and the plans are hard to understand, so there’s not as much pressure on health insurers to keep prices down. Also, some of the more popular plans have seen the largest jumps in premiums.

However, CMS actually expects base beneficiary premiums to drop in 2012. That’s in part because extremely popular drugs will be available as less-expensive generics. Some have also suggested this is because of competition.

This means that no matter how you cut it, Isakson’s claim that Medicare Part D’s premium ""has gone down almost every year since it was put in place"" is incorrect. The average cost of premiums that seniors actually pay has risen, as has the base beneficiary premium that Isakson’s staff provided.

Furthermore, using the 2006 base beneficiary premium to assess other years’ figures amounts to comparing apples to oranges. That year, it was not possible to adjust the figure to account for which plans seniors actually chose.

We presented our evidence to Isakson’s spokeswoman, who reiterated that he based his statement on federal government sources. That might be true, but the senator’s take on the numbers is not.

Rick Perry says the 2009 stimulus 'created zero jobs'
","
Texas Gov. Rick Perry criticized President Barack Obama's new jobs plan during a Republican presidential debate Sept. 12, 2011, saying his previous effort ""created zero jobs.""

WOLF BLITZER: ""Gov. Perry, the president in his new plan has a lot of tax cuts, payroll tax cuts, middle-class tax cuts, tax credits for hiring veterans, tax credits for hiring long-term unemployed people. Are those things you would support?""

RICK PERRY: ""And he's going to pay for them all with raising your taxes. That is the issue. He had $800 billion worth of stimulus in the first round of stimulus. It created zero jobs, $400-plus billion dollars in this package. And I can do the math on that one. Half of zero jobs is going to be zero jobs."" 
PolitiFact has regularly checked job claims about the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, so this one caught our ears. 
Zero? 
Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts said in February 2010 that the stimulus bill ""didn't create one new job."" He earned a Pants on Fire. 
Florida Republican Gov. Rick Scott said in September 2010 during his successful campaign for governor that the stimulus bill had ""not created one private sector job."" We smelled smoke. (We even found Billy Weston, a Florida Republican who personally credited the stimulus for his new job with a private Riviera Beach pharmaceutical manufacturer.) 
So, what's the evidence? 

The White House has posted on its stimulus website a listing of jobs funded by the stimulus, breaking it down by state and congressional district. Just for the quarter April 1 to June 20, 2011, the country had a reported 555,029 full-time equivalent jobs funded by the Recovery Act.

As our colleagues at PolitiFact Virginia have pointed out, in a report released March 18, 2011, the president’s Council of Economic Advisers estimated that between 2.5 million and 3.6 million jobs were created or saved by the stimulus through the fourth quarter of 2010.

Separately, the council’s report cited four independent analyses by the Congressional Budget Office and three private economic analysis companies. Here’s what the groups found:

• CBO: Between 1.3 million and 3.6 million jobs saved or created.

• IHS/Global Insight: 2.45 million jobs saved or created.

• Macroeconomic Advisers: 2.3 million jobs saved or created.

• Moody’s Economy.com: 2.5 million jobs saved or created.

Note the language ""created or saved,"" which means not every one of those more than a million jobs count as ""created,"" as Perry said.

But certainly more than zero. Ask Billy Weston. 

Perry said ""the first round of stimulus ... created zero jobs."" We say Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2011/sep/13/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-2009-stimulus-created-zero-jobs/

Did President Barack Obama ""steal"" $500 billion from Medicare?
","
At a debate in Tampa, the Republican presidential candidates were asked this stumper by a Florida tea party supporter: How do you convince senior citizens that Social Security and Medicare need to be changed and still get their vote?

Bachmann said she had both the government experience and the private-sector experience to understand how the programs should be changed, but she offered few specifics. 

She also took the opportunity to criticize the new health care law championed by President Barack Obama, saying, ""We know that President Obama stole over $500 billion out of Medicare to switch it over to Obamacare.""

We've looked into this topic previously, though we haven't heard the specific allegation that the money was ""stolen."" 

We'll begin with a review of how the new health care law handles funding for Medicare and for the new parts of the law. 

To begin with, the health care law leaves in place the major insurance systems: employer-provided insurance, Medicare for seniors and Medicaid for the poor. It attempts to reduce the number of uninsured by expanding Medicaid for the very poor and by offering tax breaks to help people with modest incomes buy insurance. Individuals are required to have insurance or pay a penalty, a mechanism called the ""individual mandate."" And companies that don't offer insurance to employees have to pay fines, with exceptions for small business and a few other cases. 

The national health care reform law also made several changes to Medicare, which makes up roughly 12 percent of the federal budget. 

In a few cases, the law actually increased Medicare spending to provide more benefits and coverage, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, a trusted independent source that analyzes the health care system. For instance, the health care law added money to cover prevention services and to fill a gap for enrollees who purchase prescription drugs through the Medicare Part D program. (That coverage gap is often referred to as the doughnut hole.)

Other parts of the law are intended to reduce future growth in Medicare spending, to encourage more efficiency and to improve the delivery and quality of care. (An example is paying hospitals less when patients are quickly re-admitted to hospitals after being discharged, to prevent people from being discharged too soon.) 

The bill doesn't take money out of the current Medicare budget but, rather, it attempts to slow the program's future growth, curtailing just over $500 billion in anticipated spending increases over the next 10 years. Medicare spending will still increase, however. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office projects Medicare spending will reach $929 billion in 2020, up from $499 billion in actual spending in 2009. 

So while the health care law reduces the amount of future spending growth in Medicare, the law doesn't cut current funding for Medicare.

Still, where does the $500 billion in future savings come from? 

Nearly $220 billion comes from reducing annual increases in payments that health care providers would otherwise receive from Medicare. Other savings include $36 billion from increases in premiums for higher-income beneficiaries and $12 billion from administrative changes. A new national board -- the Independent Payment Advisory Board -- will be tasked to identify $15.5 billion in savings, but the board is prohibited from proposing anything that would ration care or reduce or modify benefits. Then there's another $136 billion in projected savings that would come from changes to the Medicare Advantage program, an alternative to traditional Medicare that has turned out to be much more costly than expected. About 25 percent of Medicare beneficiaries are enrolled in a Medicare Advantage plan.

If you disregard the incendiary word ""stole,"" it is true that savings from Medicare help pay for other parts of the health care law. That's because Democrats wanted to make sure they did not increase the federal deficit with the new health law. The savings from Medicare offset new spending resulting from the health care bill. 

Mostly, the new spending in the health care law comes from tax credits to help people of modest incomes buy health insurance and from expanding Medicaid to offer coverage to the poor. The tax credits and other cost-sharing subsidies are estimated to cost $350 billion over 10 years, while the Medicaid expansion costs $434 billion, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office.

Those two initiatives add up to more than $500 billion. So in addition to reducing future Medicare spending, the law also increases Medicare taxes on the wealthy and creates new fees for the health care industry, as well as a few other things, to come up with the needed sums.

Now, to address the word ""stole."" The money was not stolen in any literal sense of the word. Congress passed the law through its normal process, and the cost reductions for Medicare were out in the open during the many weeks that the final law was being negotiated. 

Bachmann said that, ""We know that President Obama stole over $500 billion out of Medicare to switch it over to Obamacare."" There is a small amount of truth in her statement in that future savings from Medicare are planned to offset new costs created by the law. But the law attempts to curtail the rapid growth of future Medicare spending, not cut current funding. Additionally, the money was not ""stolen."" Congress reduced spending on a program through its normal legislative process. That kind of rhetoric is deceptive, and it undermines Bachmann's basic point. We rate her statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2011/sep/13/michele-bachmann/did-president-obama-steal-500-billion-medicare/

Herman Cain once again touts Galveston retirement plan at GOP debate
","
During the Sept. 12, 2011, Republican presidential debate in Tampa, Fla., Social Security took center stage, in large part because of a dispute between former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney and Texas Gov. Rick Perry over Perry's comments about the retirement program. 
But fellow candidate Herman Cain, the former CEO of Godfather’s Pizza, raised another point about Social Security: He touted the performance of a plan that allowed employees of Galveston County, Texas, to opt out of Social Security and participate in a separate retirement plan.

The topic came up when moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Cain, ""Are you with Gov. Perry that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme?""

Cain responded, ""I don't care what you call it, it's broken. And here's my solution. Start with optional personal retirement accounts. In 1981, the Galveston County employees, they opted out because that was a very short window of opportunity. They took it. Today, when people retire in Galveston County, Texas, they retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security.""

It wasn’t the first time Cain had touted the Galveston plan. During a Republican presidential debate in Manchester, N.H., Cain said something similar:

""The city of Galveston, they opted out of the Social Security system way back in the '70s,"" Cain said. ""And now, they retire with a whole lot more money. Why? For a real simple reason -- they have an account with their money on it. What I'm simply saying is we've got to restructure the program using a personal retirement account option in order to eventually make it solvent.""

We rated Cain’s previous statement about the Galveston plan Half True. His wording this time was different, but his general notion was similar -- that the Galveston plan provides its participants with benefits superior to those they would have had under Social Security.

First, some background on the Galveston program, which is an oddity in American retirement-security policy. (The federal government banned such moves by local governments in 1983.)

In 1981, employees of Galveston County -- as well as those in two adjoining Texas counties, Matagorda and Brazoria -- voted, after lengthy presentations and discussions, to withdraw from Social Security and initiate a system of individual accounts to provide retirement, survivor and disability benefits. (It’s worth pointing out that the plan only affects employees of the county government -- not everyone who lives in Galveston County, as some viewers might take away from Cain’s comment.)

Participants would contribute to their retirement accounts, supplemented by an amount from their employers, and those funds would be invested in annuities through a financial-services company chosen by a county-run bidding process.

The Alternate Plan, as it is called, was designed to supplement a separate, existing, defined-contribution pension plan known as the Texas County and District Retirement System. The Alternate Plan’s benefits are not indexed for inflation (a key difference from Social Security -- more on that below) and while each participant is assigned an individual account, the employee is not able to control investment decisions.

In recent years, as various politicians have floated ideas to partially privatize Social Security, the Galveston plan has received an unusual amount of public attention. However, the primary statistics available to gauge Cain’s claim are imperfect, since they are more than a decade old.

Judging which plan provides a better payout requires constructing models for various types of employees, accounting for variables such as income, the length and consistency of job tenure, marital status and the number and age of dependents. So comparing the two plans is a complex undertaking, and the most thorough independent examinations of the question -- a pair of 1999 studies by the Government Accountability Office and the Social Security Administration -- do not appear to have been updated in the past dozen years.

We’ll first explain what GAO and SSA concluded in 1999, then look at what variables must be taken into account before applying their 12-year-old conclusions to today.

As our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas summarized in an item published in December 2010, participants who had higher earnings and fewer or no dependents generally fared better under the Galveston plan, particularly over the near term. But workers with lower earnings and more dependents tend to receive more money under Social Security.

This stems from the plans’ divergent designs. The Galveston plan is somewhat analogous to a 401(k) plan -- that is, a plan designed to encourage workers to save for retirement -- rather than a social insurance, or safety-net, program like Social Security.

""Social Security is a social insurance program designed, in part, to provide a basic level of retirement income to help retired workers, disabled workers and their dependents and survivors stay out of poverty,"" GAO wrote in 1999. As a result, GAO said, Social Security benefits ""are tilted to provide relatively higher benefits to low-wage earners"" than they would have received based on what they put into the system.

There is no such redistributive mechanism in the Alternate Plan. If you have a higher salary and put more money into the system, you’ll get more out of it -- perhaps even more than Social Security would provide, GAO and SSA concluded. But if you are on the low end of the income scale, Social Security will give you a relatively better payout at retirement, compared with the Alternate Plan.

There’s another important factor to note. Because the Alternate Plan lacks inflation protection -- unlike Social Security, which increases benefits annually if there’s inflation in consumer prices -- the studies found a serious risk that Alternate Plan beneficiaries will fare worse over time than if they had received Social Security and its built-in cost-of-living increases. (The specific scenarios outlined in the studies are highly varied; readers who want more details should read the reports directly.)

The takeaway from the GAO and SSA studies is that the Galveston plan can be better than Social Security -- if you’re better off and if you fall into certain specific demographic categories. For many workers, especially those who are paid less, Social Security provides more.

This result doesn’t directly conflict with Cain’s statement, but it does undermine the sweeping certitude with which he said that ""when people retire in Galveston County, Texas, they retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security.""

""It's a great plan if you have worked under the plan for many years, if you do not die and leave any dependents, if you are not divorced from someone covered in the plan and if you are not interested in having your retirement income stream protected against inflation,"" said Eric Kingson, a professor at Syracuse University's School of Social Work and a longtime skeptic of the plan. ""Short-term workers who leave the plan receive little if any benefits for their work and do not have their years under the Galveston Plan covered by Social Security. Low-income working persons do not receive anything approaching the kind of protection they receive under Social Security.""

Keith Brainard, the research director for the National Association of State Retirement Administrators, agreed that the Galveston plan is better for some types of workers, including those with long tenures.

But the ""problem,"" he said, ""lies in Cain’s implication that Social Security should be a wealth-producing vehicle, when that’s not what it’s supposed to be. Social Security is supposed to be old-age insurance. That should be the emphasis of the program, not ‘retiring with a lot more money.’""

As we noted, the GAO and SSA studies are old. How do they hold up? As it turns out, they may bolster or even strengthen the case for Social Security.

The 1999 studies were conducted at a time of higher returns in the marketplace. The Galveston plan invests conservatively -- by design and from the beginning -- in annuity contracts with a guaranteed rate of return, rather than stocks. So the Galveston system is insulated from much market volatility.

Still, even these safer financial vehicles have seen ramped-down returns in the current economic climate. Because of prevailing low interest rates, the contracts now provide the minimum rate of return that was negotiated as a floor in 1981 -- either 3.75 percent or 4 percent annually, said Rick Gornto, president of First Financial Benefits Inc., who has operated the Galveston plan for 30 years. That’s lower than the 1999 GAO and SSA studies had projected.

And that’s notable, because when the 1999 studies came out, plan supporters criticized the reports for assuming lower returns than the plan had produced historically, thus unfairly selling the plan short compared to Social Security.

""These studies assumed a low 4 percent return, which is the minimum rate of return on annuities guaranteed by the insurance companies,"" wrote Judge Ray Holbrook, who oversaw the creation and administration of the Galveston plan, and Alcestis ""Cooky"" Oberg in a 2005 paper for the National Center for Policy Analysis, a conservative think tank that has been a longtime supporter of the plan. Holbrook and Oberg wrote that as of 2005, the average annual rate of return had been ""about 6.5 percent over 24 years.""

Our reading of the SSA study is that they actually assumed a 5.55 percent rate of return for the Galveston plan. The figure used in the GAO study was not specified.

Either way, the rates of return for the Alternate Plan are either equal to or lower than the 1999 studies had assumed. That would either bolster the 1999 conclusions or put the Alternate Plan at a disadvantage if such a comparison were made today. (Rates of return for Social Security depend on a person’s individual economic history, so there is no simple apples-to-apples comparison to make. That’s why comprehensive, model-based analyses like the GAO’s and the SSA's are necessary.)

Now we’ll add some caveats.

Retirement plans can only be judged on long-term returns, so today’s low rates may be putting the Galveston plan in an unusually poor light on the specific issue Cain highlighted. There’s nothing to say that the Galveston rates won’t rise in the future.

In addition, there are some advantages to the Galveston plan -- not just to the higher earners who get more out of the program, but also to the government entity running them. The Alternate Plan doesn’t face the same kind of long-term fiscal challenges that Social Security does, because it only promises participants the investment returns for the money they pay in to the system.

The downside, of course, is that the investments may not perform well enough to exceed what Social Security would have provided. In addition, some commentators have said that structural reasons would prevent a Galveston-type plan from being a good model on a national level, even if it were deemed to work well in a local context.

But that debate is beyond the scope of this article. On the specific question Cain raised -- whether participants in Galveston will ""retire making at least 50 percent more than they would ever get out of Social Security"" -- the answer is, ""it depends."" According to studies published a dozen years ago, some will, and some won’t. And the outlook today for the Galveston plan’s rate of return -- while not immutable going forward -- is more downbeat than it was in 1999. On balance, we rate Cain’s statement Half True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/13/herman-cain/herman-cain-once-again-touts-galveston-retirement-/

Mitt Romney says Rick Perry believes Social Security is unconstitutional
","
In the Sept. 12, 2011, CNN/Tea Party Express Republican debate, GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney attacked one of his rivals, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, for his stance on Social Security. 
Romney charged that Perry had, in writing a 2010 book, ""pointed out that in his view ... Social Security is unconstitutional, that this is not something the federal government ought to be involved in, that instead it should be given back to the states."" 
The charge echoed one that Romney had made in a mailer sent to Florida voters shortly before the debate. The mailer asks, ""Social Security Unconstitutional? Rick Perry believes Social Security is unconstitutional."" It then cites an excerpt from Perry’s book, Fed Up!: Our Fight to Save America from Washington: ""Social Security is something that we’ve been forced to accept for more than 70 years now. … at the expense of respect for the Constitution and limited government."" 
We looked at Perry’s book to see whether Romney’s charges were fair.

The relevant portion of the book seeks to change readers’ interpretations of President Franklin Roosevelt’s New Deal. Traditionally, Perry argues, historians have considered the New Deal an important bulwark against economic collapse during the Great Depression.

But in Perry’s view, the New Deal was in fact a disastrous policy that expanded the government’s reach, curbed individual rights and set the nation on a path to, as he put it, ""socialism.""

""There has been a slow march to socialize this country and rob us of our most basic and fundamental right to live free,"" Perry wrote. ""This march -- rooted in the Progressive movement and expanded in modern liberalism -- has been punctuated by periods of staggering government growth predicated on the notion that some problems are so big that only Washington can solve them, but only in ways that ignore the words of the Constitution. It is in these moments of crisis that Americans are most susceptible to government overreaching.""

A key culprit, he writes, was the Supreme Court, which had previously stood against a strong central government but during the 1930s lent its support -- wrongly, in Perry’s view -- to Roosevelt’s expansive agenda.

During the New Deal, ""an arrogant President Roosevelt and an emboldened Congress saw the opportunity to use a crisis to expand Washington's influence, and the Supreme Court let them do it by abdicating its role as the protector of constitutional federalism,"" Perry wrote.

""We allowed the Supreme Court and its lower courts to assume a role not envisioned for them by the Founders,"" Perry added. ""We allowed them to become policy makers by judicial fiat and to ignore their fundamental job of interpreting the Constitution and the law as given to them instead of reading virtually everything under the sun into narrowly written clauses.""

This is the backdrop to the quote used by the Romney campaign. Here’s the full quote Romney uses to justify the charge that Perry ""believes Social Security is unconstitutional"":

""Social Security is something we have been forced to accept for more than 70 years now,"" Perry writes. ""Because of that, Nobel laureate economist Milton Friedman wrote, the program is ‘one of those things on which the tyranny of the status quo is beginning to work its magic.’ Despite the controversy that surrounded its inception, it has come to be so much taken for granted that its desirability is hardly questioned any longer. And there stands a crumbling monument to the failure of the New Deal, in stark contrast to the mythical notion of salvation to which it has wrongly been attached for too long, all at the expense of respect for the Constitution and limited government.""

We won’t address the validity of Perry’s interpretation of the motivations behind the New Deal, or its long-term consequences. (Though we are certain that a robust debate could be waged over that question.)

Instead, we’ll focus on whether Romney is justified in saying that Perry ""believes Social Security is unconstitutional.""

In analyzing Romney’s charge, we are interpreting it to mean that Romney is referring to Perry’s personal view about the constitutionality of Social Security. We don’t think that Romney is simply saying that Perry is misinformed by believing that the Supreme Court has actually ruled Social Security to be unconstitutional.

So does Perry’s book support Romney’s contention?

Perry never explicitly says, ""Social Security is unconstitutional,"" or ""If I were on the Supreme Court, I would vote to declare Social Security unconstitutional."" 
But the clear message of the passages about the constitutionality of Social Security is that Perry believes that the Roosevelt administration made a wrong turn when it pursued the New Deal, and that the Supreme Court enabled that change by bowing to the administration’s wishes, junking its own limited-government judicial precedents in the process.

If Romney is saying that Perry’s personal opinion is that Social Security is unconstitutional -- and we think that is indeed what Romney is saying -- then the former Massachusetts governor can find support for that charge in Perry’s writings.

In our view, Perry makes a pretty clear argument that the Supreme Court should not have granted its approval to the New Deal in the 1930s, and that one result of the court’s actions is that ""we’ve been forced to accept (Social Security) for more than 70 years now."" The fact that Perry never explicitly wrote the words ""Social Security is unconstitutional"" keeps this statement from a full True rating, but we think that the conclusion Romney draws from Perry’s book supports that general notion. We rate Romney’s claim Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/sep/13/mitt-romney/mitt-romney-says-rick-perry-believes-social-2/

 Rick Perry says Social Security is a Ponzi scheme
","
One of the most talked-about comments from the Sept. 7, 2011, Republican presidential debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library was Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s claim that Social Security is a ""Ponzi scheme."" At the Sept. 12, 2011, GOP debate in Tampa, Perry toned down his rhetoric somewhat -- but didn’t disown the phrase that caused such a stir. 
The claim that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme became fodder for sparring between Perry and former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney -- the two candidates many observers consider the frontrunners for the nomination. 

Romney and his camp argued that the comparison of the retirement-security program for older Americans to an insidious financial fraud raised questions about Perry’s commitment to the program, which remains popular among Americans, and particularly older Americans who are statistically likelier to vote.

Here’s the original quote and context from the Sept. 7 debate at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif.:

""People who are on Social Security today, men and women who are receiving those benefits today, are individuals at my age that are in line pretty quick to get them, they don't need to worry about anything. But I think the Republican candidates are talking about ways to transition this program, and it is a monstrous lie. It is a Ponzi scheme to tell our kids that are 25 or 30 years old today, you're paying into a program that's going to be there. Anybody that's for the status quo with Social Security today is involved with a monstrous lie to our kids, and it's not right.""

Perry didn’t explicitly back away from the term, but he has sought to reframe the issue in a less polarizing fashion. In an op-ed in USA Today titled, ""Rick Perry: I am going to be honest with the American people,"" Perry didn’t mention the phrase ""Ponzi scheme,"" but he reiterated his concerns about Social Security’s financial outlook using less controversial language.

""Our elected leaders must have the strength to speak frankly about entitlement reform if we are to right our nation's financial course and get the USA working again,"" he said, adding, ""We must have the guts to talk about its financial condition if we are to fix Social Security and make it financially viable for generations to come.""

During the Sept. 12 CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa, moderator Wolf Blitzer asked Perry why he had changed his tone in the op-ed.

Perry maintained the cooler tone but didn’t back away from the terminology. ""Well, first off, the people who are on Social Security today need to understand something,"" he said. ""Slam-dunk guaranteed, that program is going to be there in place for those. Those individuals that are moving towards being on Social Security, that program's going to be there for them when they arrive there.

""But the idea that we have not had the courage to stand up and look Americans in the face, young mid-career professionals or kids that are my children's age and look them in the eye and said, listen, this is a broken system. It has been called a Ponzi scheme by many people long
before me. But no one's had the courage to stand up and say, here is how we're going to reform it.
 
""We're going to transform it for those in those mid-career ages, but we're going to fix it so that our young Americans that are going out into the workforce today will know without a doubt that there were some people who came along that didn't lie to them, that didn't try to go around the edges and told them the truth.""

As Perry noted, he was hardly the first person to compare Social Security to a Ponzi scheme; it has popped up frequently as an analogy among conservatives for many years. And in the wake of Perry’s comment, conservatives have gleefully dug up examples of liberals writing similar comparisons. A Sept. 12 article in the conservative National Review Online by Stanley Kurtz, a senior fellow at the Ethics and Public Policy Center, detailed Ponzi comparisons made by a half-dozen left-of-center columnists, including William Raspberry, Max Frankel and Michael Kinsley.

Still, Perry’s use of the comparison in the midst of a heated Republican primary campaign has attracted far more public and media attention than previous mentions -- and the fact many commentators have made this case doesn’t mean the comparison is justified. So we thought it would be worth recapping the evidence we’ve found for and against the idea that Social Security is a Ponzi scheme.

*****

So what is a Ponzi scheme? PolitiFact Texas looked at this question when researching the issue for a fact-check of Perry’s Ponzi-related comments from November 2010, when he was touring to promote his book, Fed Up!: Our Fight to Save America from Washington.

According to an online post by the Social Security Administration, the term originates with Charles Ponzi, a Boston swindler who conned investors out of millions in 1920 by promising returns of up to 100 percent in 90 days on investments in foreign postal coupons. After first-round investors harvested those profits, others flocked to Ponzi, unaware his ""profits"" consisted of money paid in by other investors.

""The reason that this is a scheme and not an investment strategy is that the geometric progression it depends on is unsustainable,"" the government post says. ""You must continually get more and more new people into the system to pay off the promises to the earlier members.""

In contrast, the administration says, Social Security is more like a ""pay-as-you-go"" system transferring payroll tax payments by American workers to American retirees. Its web post closes: ""The first modern social insurance program began in Germany in 1889 and has been in continuous operation for more than 100 years. The American Social Security system has been in continuous successful operation since 1935. Charles Ponzi's scheme lasted barely 200 days.""

When PolitiFact Texas asked Perry for back-up on his Ponzi scheme description, his campaign spokeswoman, Catherine Frazier, said that ""this year, Social Security is expected to pay out more in benefits than it collects in taxes. Americans today are being forced to pay for a program that they will no longer see any benefit from or return on their investment as it currently stands, similar to a Ponzi scheme.""

So how valid is the comparison?

Mitchell Zuckoff, a Boston University journalism professor who has written a book on Ponzi, noted three critical dissimilarities between Social Security and a Ponzi scheme, which by definition is both fraudulent and unsustainable.

""First, in the case of Social Security, no one is being misled,"" Zuckoff wrote in a January 2009 article in Fortune. ""...Social Security is exactly what it claims to be: A mandatory transfer payment system under which current workers are taxed on their incomes to pay benefits, with no promises of huge returns.""

Second, he wrote, ""A Ponzi scheme is unsustainable because the number of potential investors is eventually exhausted. That's when the last people to participate are out of luck; the music stops and there's nowhere to sit. It's true that Social Security faces a huge burden — and a significant, long-term financing problem — in light of retiring Baby Boomers. … But Social Security can be, and has been, tweaked and modified to reflect changes in the size of the taxpaying workforce and the number of beneficiaries. It would take great political will, but the government could change benefit formulas or take other steps, like increasing taxes, to keep the system from failing.""

Third, Zuckoff wrote, ""Social Security is morally the polar opposite of a Ponzi scheme... At the height of the Great Depression, our society (see ""Social"") resolved to create a safety net (see ""Security"") in the form of a social insurance policy that would pay modest benefits to retirees, the disabled and the survivors of deceased workers. By design, that means a certain amount of wealth transfer, with richer workers subsidizing poorer ones.That might rankle, but it's not fraud... None of this is to suggest that Social Security is a perfect system or that there aren't sizeable problems facing the incoming administration and Congress. But it's not a Ponzi scheme. And Ponzi himself, who died in a hospital charity ward with only enough money for his burial, would never have recognized it as his own.""

We agree with Zuckoff’s interpretation. We rated Perry's November 2010 comparison of Social Security and Ponzi schemes False, and we stand by that ruling. The comparison still deserves a rating of False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/13/rick-perry/rick-perry-says-social-security-ponzi-scheme/
"['National', 'Social Security', 'Mitt Romney']","
Mitt Romney says Rick Perry wrote that Social Security is a 'failure'
","
At a Republican presidential debate in senior-rich Florida, Mitt Romney took Rick Perry to task on Social Security.

""In writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that … by any measure Social Security has been a failure,"" Romney said in the CNN/Tea Party Express debate in Tampa on Sept. 12, 2011.

Here's the full quote:

WOLF BLITZER: ""Gov. Romney, you said that Gov. Perry's position on Social Security is, quote, unacceptable and could even obliterate the Republican Party. Are you saying he could not, as Republican nominee, beat Barack Obama?""

 MITT ROMNEY: ""No, what I'm saying is that what he just said, I think most people agree with, although the term Ponzi scheme I think is over the top and unnecessary and frightful to many people. But the real issue is in writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that in his view that Social Security is unconstitutional, that this is not something the federal government ought to be involved in, that instead it should be given back to the states.

""And I think that view, and the view that somehow Social Security has been forced on us over the past 70 years that by any measure, again quoting book, by any measure Social Security has been a failure, this is after 70 years of tens of millions of people relying on Social Security, that's a very different matter."" 
Romney's source? Perry's 2010 book, Fed Up! Our Fight to Save America from Washington.

We pulled out our copy and found the correct passage. (Read more from PolitiFact about Perry's book.)

Five pages into a section called, ""Runaway Entitlement Spending,"" on Page 62, Perry writes:

By any measure, Social Security is a failure. As author Jim Powell points out in FDR's Folly, one pro-FDR historian justified Social Security not on its merits but as an important ""symbolic gesture to demonstrate that Roosevelt's heart was in the right place."" This sounds a lot like justifying the current administration's policies because well-meaning politicians want to provide ""hope.""

Now, if you say Social Security is a failure, as I have just done, you will inherit the wind of political scorn. Seniors might think you want to cut the benefits they have paid for. Politicians will seek to take advantage, stirring up fear about benefits that will be lost if you elect another ""heartless Republican."" I get it. That's why only retired senators chair entitlement commissions.

We are told that no politician has the courage to raise these issues, even if avoiding them puts us on the fast track to financial run. But by remaining quiet, politicians are really saying they think the American people won't understand it if we share the grim details of our financial future, and that voters will simply kill -- or vote against -- the messenger in order to continue to receive an underfunded benefit that robbed them of the tens of thousands of dollars they should have made.

Is that how we should respect our fellow citizens?

So indeed, Perry said Social Security ""is a failure;"" he even acknowledged that doing so means he will ""inherit the wind of political scorn.""

What did Perry mean by ""the tens of thousands of dollars they should have made""? In the same section of the book he says payroll taxes would have been better left in workers' pockets: ""If only the New Dealers had been kind enough to allow workers to make their own choice about whether to participate. As we know from experience, individuals would have done better on their own.""

He points out that ""many private pension plans return 8 percent per year, compared to Social Security's paltry 2 percent or less."" Then he offers the example of three Texas counties that opted out of Social Security for a private option before that door was shut in 1983.

""Employees in those private plans, having exercised their liberty at Washington's sufferance, are reaping the benefits."" 

He doesn't address Social Security's other roles, such as disability insurance and survivor's benefits, nor what he believes should happen to low-income workers who under Social Security draw more in retirement benefits then they're able to contribute in payroll taxes.

Does Perry stand by his 2010 book? Less than a month ago he told a reporter in Des Moines, ""I haven't backed off anything in my book. So read the book again and get it right."" 

On Sept. 11, 2011, he clarified for USA Today, ""As I said at the Reagan Library recently, Social Security benefits for current recipients and those nearing retirement must be protected. For younger workers, we must consider reforms to make Social Security financially viable.""

But Romney made it clear he was quoting from Perry's book. He said ""In writing his book, Gov. Perry pointed out that … by any measure Social Security has been a failure."" And indeed, in Perry's book, Fed Up!, he touts the benefits of private plans and says: ""By any measure, Social Security is a failure.""

"['Economy', 'Transportation', 'Florida', 'Bob Buckhorn']","
Bob Buckhorn says one new international route at TIA would generate $150 million and 2,300 jobs
","
Tampa Mayor Bob Buckhorn is defending a program to offer financial sweeteners for airlines that fly nonstop international routes out of Tampa International Airport.

The benefits of even one new daily flight would outweigh the costs in incentives, Buckhorn said during an interview with WEDU-TV's Rob Lorei on his Florida This Week program.

""One international flight a day in a wide-bodied jet ... one flight daily generates $150 million a year and approximately 2,300 jobs when that money spreads out into the local economy,"" Buckhorn said in an interview that aired Sept. 2.

We heard the numbers and wondered: Could just one new daily international flight pack that economic punch?

In an interview with PolitiFact Florida, Buckhorn said his figures came from the airport. We found a study presented by an airport consultant in March.

But his numbers didn't quite match up. It turns out he cherry-picked one figure and inflated the other.

The $150 million a year Buckhorn cited was predicted only for European or Asian flights. The majority of the new routes sought by Tampa are instead to Central and South America. The study said those would have less than half the value to the local economy, under $70 million per new route.

On the jobs figure, it appears Buckhorn misspoke. Even flights to Europe or Asia would only add around 1,200 jobs to the local economy, the study showed. Not 2,300.

But we also wanted to look at the study itself. Economic impact studies can generate wildly different results depending on how they're conducted, by a factor of 100 percent in one non-airport example, according to an FAA-sponsored review. 

John Kasarda, an expert in aviation-driven economic development at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, said the study's basic numbers — $150 million and 1,200 jobs — were ""consistent with economic impact studies of international routes by wide-body jets.""

We also spoke with Christina Cassotis, the consultant who presented the $25,638 study's findings in March. She explained that to estimate the impact of, say, a daily flight to Europe, you've got to pick an aircraft type — in this case, an Airbus 330. ""What we selected is a very common aircraft,"" she said. They picked a price for fuel, and how much the aircraft might burn (and therefore buy in Tampa) — a $14 million impact. They made some other basic assumptions — that about 2 percent of flights would get canceled, that 15 percent of seats might stay empty. They looked into other spending at the airport itself, worth a few million bucks more: What would the airline pay for gate use? How much extra use might a club room get? What else would passengers and crew spend?

Then they looked at impact outside the airport. They estimated that more than 75 percent of passengers would be visitors to the area, rather than locals — and spend more than $70 million. (The airport offered a breakdown of visitors vs. locals; Visit St. Petersburg Clearwater had research on how long they might stay; U.S. Department of Commerce studies helped with what they might spend.) 
Once they calculated that direct and indirect spending — at the airport and in the community — they did a calculation of how that money might move through the economy, known as spinoff or ""induced"" impact. An economics expert with Economic Development Research Group in Boston used a common model, called IMPLAN, to help calculate a multiplier, which varies by geography and industry. This one took into account about 20 industries touched by visitor spending, from car rental to hotels to shopping. It ended up being reasonably modest, as multipliers go. That added another $64 million to the bottom line.

Airline fuel purchases, visitor spending and all that money's reverberation through the economy — those were the three biggest ways an added flight would lift Tampa Bay, the study showed.

Our ruling

The mayor drew on a consultant's study to support the need to lure international flights to Tampa. But he chose an economic impact of $150 million for his generalization — when just one of the airport's five target areas is in Europe. The rest are in Central and South America, which the study says would generate less than half the economic impact he mentioned. Meanwhile, he misspoke on the jobs number, nearly doubling it. Still, the study does support the idea that a new flight's impact might justify local hustle and incentives, the core of Buckhorn's argument.

"['State Budget', 'Virginia', 'George Allen']","
Allen says he reined in state spending as governor
","
Republican George Allen is promising his unrelenting effort to curb federal spending if he’s elected to the U.S. Senate next year.

He says he’ll bring to Washington the same kind of ""sweeping reform"" he brought to Virginia as governor from 1994 to 1998. His campaign web site says that when Allen was governor, ""He challenged critics and sentiment that suggested it couldn’t be done, reining in government spending and substantially reducing the size of the state workforce.""

Last week, we looked at Allen’s claim he ""substantially reduced"" the state workforce and rated it Mostly True. Although there was a 9 percent drop in the number of bureaucrats during Allen’s administration, the state’s reliance on private contractors grew.  

In this fact check, we’ll examine Allen’s assertion that he reined in state spending. The claim runs into instant trouble because, by any measure, overall state spending increased significantly during his administration. Allen’s major effort to slash the budget and offer a tax cut was thwarted by Democrats who controlled the General Assembly.

When Allen took office in January 1994, he inherited an overall  $14.7 billion budget for the state fiscal year that started the previous July 1. At the end of his term in January 1998, he left behind a $20.7 billion proposed budget for the fiscal year that started the following July 1.

That means Allen endorsed $6 billion in additional spending when he was governor -- a 40.7 percent increase.

But looking at overall spending may be unfair. Slightly more than half of outlays during Allen’s years came from the non-general fund, over which a governor has limited control. The fund consists of earmarked revenues such as college tuition and federal highway grants.

A better gauge comes from examining the general fund, which supports public education, health programs and public safety. It’s mostly supported by state income and sales taxes.

The general fund was almost $6.8 billion when Allen took office. At the end of his term, he proposed a $9.9 billion general fund budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, 1998.

That means Allen endorsed $3.1 billion in additional general fund spending when he was governor -- a 45.6.percent rise.

How does Allen square the increase with his claim that he reined in state spending?

Allen’s advisers say the claim does not imply that bottom-line spending went down during his term or that the former governor even slowed an historic pattern of general fund budget growth. They say the statement simply means Allen streamlined specific parts of Virginia’s government. They point to his reduction of the workforce, his repeal of many regulations and his successful initiative to reduce welfare rolls by requiring recipients to find work.

""When you look at spending, you can’t just look at the bottom line because the economy improved so much when he was governor,"" said Bill Riggs, Allen’s campaign spokesman. ""What you need to do is look at specific reforms.""

Mike Thomas, Allen’s campaign manager, offered a similar view. ""I can’t recall a single time when George Allen said he was going to cut the state budget,"" he said. ""He said he was going to eliminate unnecessary and wasteful spending.""

Although 45.6 percent general fund growth under Allen may sound gigantic, in reality, it’s about average for a Virginia governor. The general fund budget has grown by 479 percent over the last 30 years, from almost $2.7 billion in 1981 to almost $15.5 billion this fiscal year.

Many factors explain the expansion: population has grown, creating greater revenues and a greater demand for services; Medicaid costs have increased dramatically, often by 10 percent a year; and inflation.

Allen tried to slow the growth by proposing a $2.1 billion tax cut in early 1995. The measure was opposed by the business community and defeated by the Democrat-controlled General Assembly. After that point, Allen had little choice but to spend the revenues coming in.

Thomas noted that a number of general fund expenditures during Allen’s administration did not expand the reach of Virginia’s government. For example:

*A settlement with federal employees who were unfairly taxed by the state cost roughly $300 million.

*The cost of the state’s mandated share of funding public education rose by more than $1 billion.

*Medicaid costs rose by $244 million.

*Allen was required to deposit $214 million in the state’s Rainy Day Fund.

Thomas also pointed out that in Allen’s final budget proposal, he left a $260 million down payment to help his successor, Republican Jim Gilmore, keep a campaign pledge to phase out the car tax.

Allen’s major spending initiative was a $400 million prison building program to keep his campaign promises to abolish parole and lengthen criminal sentencing.

Our ruling:

Allen takes credit for ""reining in state spending"" when he was governor. In fact, general fund spending grew by 46.8 percent from the budget Allen inherited when he was inaugurated in January 1994, and the budget he recommended before leaving office in January 1998. Even if you subtract about $1.75 billion in spending increases Allen aides say he was required to authorize, the general fund budget would have increased 20 percent under Allen’s watch.

Allen’s advisers says the statement does not imply that the former governor reduced the budget’s bottom line or slowed its historic growth pattern. They say it simply means that Allen streamlined certain programs.

Sure, Allen’s attempt to pass an historic tax cut in 1995 was thwarted by rival Democrats who controlled the General Assembly that year. Allen could accurately say he fought to curb spending.

But Allen says he reined it in. That creates an impression the bottom line shrank or was stunted in growth. We rate the statement False.",/factchecks/2011/sep/12/george-allen/allen-says-he-reined-state-spending-governor/
"['Georgia', 'Economy', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Gingrich: Bernanke's policies inflationary to extreme levels
","
The Republican candidates for president aimed most of their rhetorical ammunition during Wednesday’s debate at President Obama, but there were a few shots at Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke.

One verbal attack by former U.S. House Speaker Newt Gingrich at Bernanke caught our attention.

""I think he's been the most inflationary, dangerous and power-centered chairman of the Fed in the history of the Fed,"" said Gingrich, a former U.S. House member from the Atlanta suburbs.

The Federal Reserve is the central bank of the United States and tries to make sure the nation’s monetary and credit conditions are stable. The Republican field for president have all been critical of the economic policies of Obama, a Democrat, focusing on issues like the nation’s high unemployment rate and his desire to end tax cuts for the wealthiest earners. Some of that criticism has befallen Bernanke, who was first nominated to the position by President George W. Bush, a Republican, during the latter part of his administration.

The parts about Bernanke being ""dangerous"" and ""power-centered"" seemed grist for debate among political wonks. Inflationary sounded like something easier to check with data, a claim worthy of the Truth-O-Meter.

Here’s what we found.

Gingrich spokesman R.C. Hammond explained the basis of his comments, along with forwarding a speech the candidate made in June to the Atlanta Press Club.

""Newt's comments were based on reports of unaccounted spending reaching into the billions the Fed has doled out over the past few years,"" Hammond told us in an e-mail.

In that speech, Gingrich criticized Bernanke’s support for the 2008 bank bailout and says some Fed policies weaken the U.S. dollar by promoting inflation.

""For example, the Fed might increase the money supply substantially in the belief that such monetary expansion will spark economic growth,"" Gingrich said. ""But a Fed that floods the economy with new dollars in an attempt to stimulate economic growth and new jobs is a Fed that decreases the value of every dollar in every American’s pocket through higher inflation, making every American poorer.

""Look at what has already happened,"" Gingrich continued. ""Today, we have a dollar that is stunningly weaker than it used to be, and the price of everything from gasoline to groceries is steadily drifting upward.""

Bernanke is the 14th chairman of the Federal Reserve. The first was Charles S. Hamlin, an attorney and former assistant Treasury Department secretary who served from August 1914 to August 1916. The tenures varied, from two to three years in the case of Hamlin, Roy Young and Eugene Meyer, to nearly 19 years in the case of Alan Greenspan, who served from August 1987 through January 2006. Bernanke became Fed chairman in February 2006.

We looked at the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index, which measures the prices nearly 90 percent of Americans pay for goods and services and is used by most economists to determine inflation rates.

The bureau keeps annual data on the change to the index. Since some Fed chairmen did not serve an entire year, we only used full years to make a comparison. In 1958, the bureau decided to track the index in two ways, with and without including food and energy. Some economists don’t like to include food and energy because they fluctuate more than other costs. We didn’t find much of a difference in the annual change if you excluded food and energy.

The highest average annual index was nearly 11 percent, which occurred under Chairman William P.G. Harding from 1917 to 1921. The second-highest rate was from 1971 to 1977, when Arthur Burns was chairman. The annual average index between 2007, the first full year of Bernanke’s term, to 2010 was just below 2 percent. Bernanke was in the middle of the pack in comparison to the other Fed chairmen.

Barry Bosworth, an economics expert at the liberal/centrist-leaning Brookings Institution, said he would use a similar method to measure Bernanke. The percentage he found under Bernanke was nearly the same.

""It is unusually low,"" said Bosworth.

We also tried another method to see if Gingrich had a point. We used the bureau’s index inflation calculator. We looked at how much $100 was worth in the first year of each chairman’s term and the last year. Harding, again, had the highest average percentage change. Bernanke, again, was in the middle of the pack.

Dan Mitchell, whose biography says he worked as an economist for former U.S. Sen. Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), believes the index is not the best way to measure inflation.

""[I]nflation can then show up in various ways - a rising CPI, an asset bubble, excess reserves redeposited at the Fed, etc. I'm not saying Gingrich is necessarily right. But I am saying that CPI is not the right variable, (though that's how the average thinks of it),"" Mitchell said.

Mitchell, a senior fellow at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute, contends that ""inflation is the creation of excess liquidity by the central bank."" The definition is similar to Gingrich’s argument that Bernanke flooded the economy with too many dollars.

J.D. Foster, an economist whose biography says he worked in the White House Office of Management and Budget, told us that inflation is accelerating, but still low. He said some of Bernanke’s policies could result in much higher rates.

""There is a long and variable delay between monetary policy actions and inflationary effects. So looking at today's inflation really doesn't tell you much about future inflation. Therein can one defend with no trouble Gingrich's comments about inflation,"" said Foster, who worked at the conservative-leaning Heritage Foundation.

Donald Ratajczak, a leading economist and former director of Georgia State University’s Economic Forecasting Center, said ""(Bernanke) has been one of the least"" inflationary Fed chairmen.

Ratajczak said the only rationale he could consider is that Gingrich was referring to the expansion of assets of the Federal Reserve.

""But that’s not the same thing,"" said Ratajczak, who still writes a weekly commentary on the economy for Morgan Keegan, an investment firm.

Our ruling:

Gingrich is making the point that Bernanke has created a huge pool of liquidity that is raising inflationary pressures to levels never seen under previous Fed chairmen.

However, the current CPI rates are still low, and Gingrich’s concerns haven’t been seen in Consumer Price Index averages, which are widely used to monitor inflation. The index has been higher under other Fed chairmen, and Bernanke is in the middle under such a comparison.

"['Ohio', 'Economy', 'Jobs', 'John Kasich']","
Gov. John Kasich touts administration role in creating ""a net increase of 45,000 jobs""
","
Gov. John Kasich recently appeared on Fox News — his old stomping grounds — to tout Ohio’s improved credit and economic outlook.

In an interview on ""Fox and Friends,"" the governor noted that Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services had recently announced that it was upping Ohio’s credit outlook to stable from negative, but that it was keeping the state’s actual credit rating at AA+.

The vote of confidence is good news, because if S&P decides to increase the rating to AAA in the future, it would make it cheaper for the state to borrow money.

S&P showed Ohio some love after Kasich and like-minded legislators approved a state budget that covered a projected deficit estimated in the billions and because the state was undergoing a modest economic recovery.

In the interview, Kasich rightly took credit for the budget balancing, adding that the improved credit outlook sends a message that Ohio is a good place to do business.

And among his comments: ""Since the beginning of the year we’ve created a net increase of 45,000 jobs. Our unemployment has ticked up because we’re not creating as many jobs as we need, but the fact is we are net up in job creation.""

Creating jobs is Kasich’s job one, so PolitiFact Ohio decided to take a look.

The statistic itself is easy to check. Ohio did add 45,100 jobs from the end of January through July, according to Ohio Labor Market Information, a division of the Ohio Department of Job and Family Services.

In fact, if you include January (Kasich was sworn in Jan. 10), you could add another 34,100 jobs since the first of the year.

But can the governor take credit for the job growth, as he seemed to be doing on Fox News?

Specifically, Kasich said the improved credit outlook, ""sends a signal, not just to the citizens here but to businesses in our state and businesses around the country that Ohio is open for business because at the end of the day you want to make sure that you’re creating jobs and since the beginning of the year we’ve created a net increase of 45,000 jobs. Our unemployment has ticked up because we’re not creating as many jobs as we need, but the fact is we are net up in job creation.""

Politicians like to tout good things that happen on their watch (or bad things on their opponent’s).  

As his term was about to expire, outgoing Gov. Strickland noted the state’s unemployment trend was already improving, just in time for Kasich to take credit for it.

""We are one of only two states to have eight consecutive months of declining unemployment,"" Strickland said. PolitiFact Ohio checked the numbers and rated his claim True.

On the flip side, Republicans hammered Strickland over Ohio job losses during the gubernatorial campaign.  In their campaign against Strickland. ""Ohio lost 400,000 jobs on his watch,"" the Republican Governors Association proclaimed in an attack ad.

PolitiFact Ohio rated that claim Half True. The number was correct, but it was inaccurate to put all the blame for Ohio’s economic woes on Strickland.

Two experts we talked to agreed Kasich’s policies are pro-business. But neither believes Kasich can take credit for the creation of 45,100 jobs.

What really drives job creation is the business cycle, and that began to turn around in June of 2009, said Ken Mayland, an economist with ClearView Economics in Pepper Pike, Ohio.

Job creation numbers going back to January 2010 prove that out. Ohio has created 104,300 jobs over that time.

""It helps to have the business cycle for you as opposed to against you,"" Mayland said.

Just ask former President George H.W. Bush.

The elder Bush lost his re-election to Bill Clinton despite a recovering economy, Mayland said, because the perception was that the economy was doing poorly. Clinton ""basically rode the economic wave upwards through the rest of the ’90s, or a good part of ’90s,"" he said.

Leroy Brooks, Mellen Chair of Finance at John Carroll University, also credits the job growth during Kasich’s term so far to a continuation of what started last year when demand for Ohio products started to increase and inventories started coming down.

""He did not cause the growth we had in the first couple quarters,"" Brooks said.

That said, Brooks would agree that Kasich’s policies are more likely to produce jobs, but if the economy retrenches as some are predicting, it won’t really matter.

The governor stands by his statement. His spokesman Rob Nichols claims Strickland would have hiked taxes to balance the budget and that would have hurt job creation.

""We would not be creating the jobs we are now,"" he said. He further cites an CNBC survey that pushed Ohio from 34 to 23 in its rankings for ""America’s top states for business.""

But that misses the point.

There is an element of truth in the governor’s statement: Ohio did add 45,100 jobs from the end of January through July.

But the portion of the statement where the governor says ""we’ve created"" the jobs ignores some critical facts that would give a different impression.

While the economists we talked to agree that the governor’s policies could be good for job creation or retention in the long run, they also agree it’s too soon to tell. There hasn’t been enough time for them to kick in, they say.

Standard & Poors cited Ohio’s balanced budget as having a positive impact, but that didn’t happen until the end of June.

Ohio has registered job growth since early last year, well before Kasich was elected. And while his efforts have received some positive reviews, there are many factors beyond the governor’s office that impact job growth.

WNYC host Brian Lehrer asked Pascrell (D-8th Dist.) in a recent radio interview about August’s stagnant employment numbers. Pascrell called the federal jobs report ""disappointing"" and highlighted the larger impact of decreasing government employment.

""We’ve lost public jobs,"" Pascrell said in the Sept. 2 interview. ""Whether it's policemen, firemen, sanitation people, we got to understand that there's six to seven hundred thousand of these folks who have been laid off [in the last] year and a half. If we continue to put our heads in the sand and don't recognize that that's part of the equation as well, then we're never going to address this.""

The nation didn’t lose as many government jobs in the time frame Pascrell mentioned, but his numbers aren’t far off. And while there’s debate on whether smaller government is better for the economy, we won’t be ruling on that issue in this Truth-O-Meter item.

Pascrell’s spokesman, Paul Brubaker, told PolitiFact New Jersey the congressman was referring to local, state and federal government workers in his interview.

Brubaker sent us an article from U.S. News & World Report that said, ""Since the end of the recession, government employment -- including federal, state, and local jobs -- has fallen by roughly 600,000."" The actual number is 595,000, according to seasonally-adjusted federal data.

But Pascrell didn’t reference the end of the recession -- which the National Bureau of Economic Research says ended in June 2009 -- in the radio interview.

Still, if we hold Pascrell strictly to the time frame he mentioned, he’s not wildly off from the range he cited.

In the past 18 months -- from February 2010 to August, the most recent data available -- the nation lost 512,000 government jobs. During the same time frame, nearly 2.4 million private-sector jobs were created. The decrease in public-sector jobs offset the net total in those 18 months by nearly 21 percent, to about 1.9 million.

We reached out to two experts from Washington, D.C. think tanks for their take on the role that decreasing public-sector employment has had on the current jobs situation.

""Losses in government employment help account for the fact that overall job growth has been so slow,"" said Gary Burtless, senior fellow in economic studies at the Brookings Institution, a policy think tank. ""Drops in government employment have worsened the nation’s employment picture and worsened the prospects of unemployed workers who are seeking to get re-employed or to get their first career jobs.""

James Sherk, senior policy analyst in labor economics at the conservative Heritage Foundation,  said ""public-sector job losses have had a relatively minor role in the U.S. employment situation thus far"" and ""government jobs will not play a constructive role in pulling the U.S. out of its current situation.""

It’s worth noting that state and local governments employ the vast majority of public workers. Of all government employees, 64 percent work for local governments, 23 percent work for state governments and 13 percent work for the federal government.

In New Jersey, 30,500 public jobs were eliminated in the 18 months from January 2010 to July, the most recent state-level figures available.  Of those jobs, 18,200 were in local government, 10,900 were in state government and 1,400 were in federal government.

The ruling

Pascrell said 600,000 to 700,000 public employees have been laid off in the last year and a half.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the nation has lost 512,000 government jobs at the federal, state and local level in the past 18 months.

Pascrell’s numbers were off, but not wildly off. And his argument that public-sector job losses are having an impact on net job growth is valid.

We rate his statement Mostly True.

"['Bipartisanship', 'Wisconsin', 'Brett Hulsey']","
Wisconsin Rep. Brett Hulsey says only one of 376 bill amendments proposed by a Democrat was adopted by GOP-controlled Assembly
","
In early August 2011, after surveys tagged him as possibly the nation’s most polarizing governor, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker pledged a renewed focus on bi-partisanship and jobs.

Later that month, Wisconsin Assembly Speaker Jeff Fitzgerald, R-Horicon, echoed the call. He said some jobs-related bills proposed by Democrats were good and would take them up by the Assembly after it returns from its summer recess on Sept. 13, 2011.

Rep. Brett Hulsey, D-Madison, professed doubts about the sincerity of the GOP calls for bi-partisanship. On Aug. 27, 2011, the day Fitzgerald’s comments were posted online, Hulsey said in an opinion column in The Capital Times of Madison:

""On the floor of the Legislature, Assembly Republicans have rubber-stamped Walker’s corporate agenda while rejecting hundreds of Democratic amendments, even though many were common-sense measures that emphasized accountability or saved money. So far, Republicans have accepted only one out of 376 amendments offered by Assembly Democrats.""

Bi-partisanship, of course, can be measured in many ways. But the one-out-of-376 statistic caught our attention, so we decided to check it out.

We started by asking Hulsey to clarify his statement.

Hulsey said that of all the bills adopted by the Assembly in 2011 before it adjourned for the summer, only one of 376 amendments proposed by a Democrat was adopted. Some amendments were proposed on the Assembly floor and others in Assembly committees, he said.

The single Democrat-sponsored amendment that was approved, according to Hulsey, was to Assembly Bill 94. That bill made administrative changes to the Milwaukee school choice program, which uses taxpayer dollars to send children to private schools.

The amendment was introduced by Rep. Jason Fields, D-Milwaukee, a school choice supporter. It specifies that a pupil currently participating in the choice program may continue to attend a private school if their family’s income increases above current income eligibility requirements and that the pupil’s siblings are not subject to current income eligibility requirements, according to the Wisconsin Legislative Council, which provides legal and other services to legislative committees.

To check Hulsey’s numbers, we contacted the Assembly chief clerk’s office, which referred us to the Wisconsin Legislative Technology Services Bureau. Hulsey contacted the bureau, as well. The bureau determined there were even more Democratic amendments than Hulsey had claimed -- 399 -- and that only the Fields amendment was adopted.

We asked Walker spokesman Cullen Werwie and Fitzgerald spokesman John Jagler about the numbers. Neither disputed them.

Jagler said many of the Democratic amendments were voted down because they were politically motivated. He also said that for the 2009-2011 state budget -- adopted when Democrats controlled the governor’s office and both chambers of the Legislature -- Republicans offered more than 120 amendments and none were adopted.

That suggests Hulsey’s statement is just a measure of the reality of what happens when one party has outright control in Madison.

Is the number of opposition amendments adopted a good measure of bi-partisanship?

We put that question to two former state lawmakers, one from each party, who served in both the Assembly and the Senate.

Mordecai Lee, a Democrat who represented Milwaukee and now teaches governmental affairs at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said the sheer volume of Democratic amendments rejected by the Republican-controlled Assembly is evidence ""that these people despise each other.""

Brian Rude, a lobbyist and a Republican who represented the La Crosse area, agreed that the number of rejected amendments indicates a split, but added: ""Partisanship has always been part of the process. Parties get elected to stand for something.""

For his part, Werwie cited a spreadsheet produced by the governor’s office on the 44 bills Walker has signed into law. It shows there were a total of 331 yes votes by Assembly Democrats on the bills.

That means, on average, 7.5 of the 38 Democrats voted yes on each of the 44 bills.

Our conclusion

Hulsey said the Republican-controlled state Assembly adopted only one of nearly 400 amendments offered by Democrats to bills that were adopted by the Assembly. Complete official data is not available, but GOP leaders don’t dispute that only one Democratic amendment was approved.

Wis. Gov. Scott Walker says the St. Norbert College poll has been repeatedly wrong
","
As Wisconsin Democrats geared up to begin the process of recalling Gov. Scott Walker, a public opinion survey released Nov. 15, 2011 contained some troubling results for the first-term Republican.

The poll, conducted by St. Norbert College in De Pere and Wisconsin Public Radio, said 58 percent of respondents believe Walker should be recalled. That was an increase from 47 percent  in an April poll conducted by the same partnership.

When asked in a television interview about the results, Walker turned the tables and focused on the poll itself:

""Literally, it's been wrong in almost every election,"" Walker said. ""It's been completely off the mark. It's nowhere near any other poll that's been out there. I don't take any credence in that.""

The St. Norbert poll has been around since 1984 and its results receive wide coverage in the state media. This is the first instance we could find of someone publicly claiming it’s fundamentally a ""bad"" poll.

When we asked Walker’s office to provide evidence of the governor’s claim, they sent us to state Republican Party spokesman Ben Sparks.

He made two points:

Polling sample: The result of the recent poll ""is essentially worthless"" because pollsters interviewed 426 adult residents and did not narrow the group to likely voters, he said. That reduces its accuracy, he said, because there’s no way of knowing whether or not these people participate in elections.

Track record:  In October 2010, the St. Norbert/WPR poll looked at the upcoming election for governor, pitting Walker against Democrat Tom Barrett. ""That poll did not reflect the election results within the margin of error,"" Sparks said. He offered no additional evidence about the poll’s accuracy in previous elections.

We’ll start with a caveat: We’re examining Walker’s statement, not attempting to rate the St. Norbert poll against any others. It’s worth noting that since the St. Norbert poll  generally uses a smaller sample than most, it will have a larger margin of error.

On the question of who was polled, a separate poll conducted a few weeks earlier than St. Norbert’s poll shows how results can differ depending on the group targeted.

Public Policy Polling reported Oct. 26, 2011 that state voters were evenly divided about recalling Walker. That poll had a far larger sample -- 1,170 -- than the St. Norbert poll with a margin of error of plus or minus 2.9 percentage points. Another key difference is that Public Policy Polling interviewed likely voters; St. Norbert’s sample, as mentioned, came from all state adults.

Sparks argued that made the poll ""worthless.""

But his criticism is more an assessment of the poll’s predictive value, not whether it is accurate in terms of what it set out to measure. And it should be noted the pollsters did not hide who was sampled, or present its findings as representing likely voters.

On the question of the poll’s track record, we turned to University of Wisconsin-Madison political science professor Charles Franklin, founder of a website called Pollster.com. That site compiles and keeps track of all Wisconsin polls that are publicly available as well as national ones.

Franklin said one measure of the accuracy of the St. Norbert poll was to look at the results of other polls conducted at about the same time.

After all, polls are a snapshot -- not a prediction -- and influenced by advertising, debates and other developments in a campaign. So it makes sense to stick with the same time frame.

Franklin looked at two polls conducted at the same time St. Norbert researchers were in the field. For the pre-election poll, St. Norbert researchers sought out likely voters (not all adults), as did the other two polls he reviewed.

St. Norbert pollsters interviewed voters Oct. 12 to 15, 2010. Opinion Research Corp., working  for CNN/Time, was in the field Oct. 8 to 12, and the Mellman Group, a firm that works for Democrats, conducted its interviews Oct. 18 to 20.

Here are the results: 
The actual results of the Nov. 2 election: Walker 52.2 percent; Barrett 46.5 percent.

So how did the St. Norbert poll do?

Franklin said there are two ways to measure this, beyond the obvious fact that it got the winner right.

The difference between the poll result and the actual outcome. St. Norbert had Walker leading Barrett 50 to 41. Walker actually got 52.2 and Barrett got 46.5. That’s .5 of a percentage point outside the poll’s 5 percentage point margin of error.

The margin of victory. St. Norbert had Walker ahead by 9 and he won by 5.7 So it was off by 3.3 points. At the very worst they underestimated Barrett by 5.5 and Walker by 2.2, Franklin said.

Franklin also looked at the results from the same St. Norbert poll for the U.S. Senate race between Republican Ron Johnson and Democratic incumbent Russ Feingold. The poll showed Johnson at 49 percent and Feingold at 47 percent.

Johnson got 51.9 percent to Feingold's 47 percent, so a 2.9 error on the margin.

Franklin’s conclusion: ""At least in 2010, St. Norbert was right on both winners while over estimating the size of Walker's win and under estimating the size of Johnson's win by 3.3 and 2.9 points respectively. Those errors are both within the theoretical margin of error for the sample size they used.""

We asked St. Norbert Poll director David Wegge about the most recent poll.

Why didn’t they interview likely voters?

Wegge said the most recent poll surveyed 482 adults and was an effort to measure public opinion on a variety of topics, including general public policy matters and the effort to recall Walker. He said the pollsters were not trying to assess the outcome of an election, so they didn’t limit their sample to likely voters.

Wegge, who founded the St. Norbert Survey Center (now called the Strategic Research Institute), said the organization does professional research for a variety of clients including the United Way, the Green Bay Packers, Affinity Health Systems and the Oneida Tribe.

He noted the poll fared well in a 2010 blog by Nate Silver of the New York Times, who looked at the performance of 265 pre-election polls nationally. St. Norbert ranked 45th on that list, six places behind the far-better-known CBS/New York Times and in between polls run by the Kansas City Star and the Miami Herald/St. Petersburg Times.

Finally, we looked at the results of St. Norbert’s pre-election poll from a couple of other state-wide elections. Remember, Walker claimed the poll was ""wrong in almost every election.""

Wegge said the same size and margin of error has been the same for years -- about 400 people and plus or minus 5 points. The pre-election polls always look at likely voters, he said.

For the pre-election poll in the 2004 presidential race: St. Norbert had Democrat John Kerry at 48 (actual result, 50) President George Bush 43 (49) and undecided at 5 (none in the actual vote). The undecideds broke to Bush, and the poll was ""right.""

For the 2002 gubernatorial election: Democrat Jim Doyle 41 (45) Republican Scott McCallum 33 (42), Independent Ed Thompson 6 (11) and undecided 17 (none.) That large group of undecided voters moved primarily to the losing candidates. Because of the undecideds, the poll was too low on McCallum -- outside the margin of error -- but it did get the winner and losers correct.

So what result do we get?

Walker dismissed a St. Norbert/WPR poll that showed 58 percent of state residents favored a recall as being consistently wrong. As evidence, the GOP criticized the pollsters for not quizzing likely voters. And they said the poll got the 2010 election wrong, but offered no evidence that the poll has been ""consistently wrong.""

In it’s most recent poll, St. Norbert wasn’t trying to predict an election outcome. It was  looking at whether the general public favored a recall. Secondly, GOP spokesman Sparks and Walker were wrong about the poll when it came to the 2010 results. The poll got that race right. And there’s no evidence that the poll has been consistently wrong in the past.

Chris Christie claims Barack Obama “did nothing” to create jobs during his first two years
","Billions of dollars began pumping through the American economy in 2009 as part of the stimulus program started by President Barack Obama, but somehow Gov. Chris Christie missed that.

While campaigning on Nov. 9 in New Hampshire for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, Christie took to the airwaves and summed up in one word what the president did to spur job growth during the first half of his tenure: nothing.

""But remember this: (Obama) can complain about Republicans in the House as much as he wants,"" Christie said during an interview on the ""New Hampshire Today"" radio show. ""But in the first two years, he had, you know, huge majorities in the House and Senate, and did nothing with them to create jobs in America.""

Nothing was done to create jobs?

Research by PolitiFact New Jersey shows that Christie’s statement ignores the impact of a major piece of federal legislation aimed at creating and saving jobs: the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

Signed into law less than a month into Obama’s presidency, the stimulus bill allocated about $787 billion in federal spending and tax benefits. By Sept. 30 of this year, about $5.5 billion had been awarded to recipients in New Jersey alone.

According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office and other independent economists, the stimulus bill has created or saved jobs. Funding recipients also have reported jobs supported by stimulus dollars.

The governor’s office did not respond to requests for comment.

Here’s what some of the economic research shows:

Compared to what would have happened otherwise, the stimulus bill increased the number of people employed by between 1 million and 2.9 million in the second quarter of 2011, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody’s Analytics, projected that without the stimulus bill, the country would have had 1.75 million fewer jobs as of the third quarter of 2011.

""The debate is how much, not whether it had a benefit,"" Zandi said.

Daniel Wilson, a senior economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco, has estimated that stimulus spending created or saved 3.4 million jobs by March 2011.

Ohio State University economics professor Bill Dupor offered another projection.

Due to the stimulus bill, there were 870,000 private-sector jobs and 510,000 government jobs in place in December 2010, said Dupor, who made the analysis with University of Western Ontario economics professor Tim Conley.

""Thus, Tim and I are finding some jobs created/saved as a result of the ARRA,"" Dupor said in a series of emails. ""At this stage, Tim and I don’t have any projections based on plausible assumptions that say there was a net job loss.""

Another snapshot of the stimulus bill’s impact on jobs can be found at the government-run website -- recovery.gov -- which tracks jobs funded by stimulus dollars, as reported by certain recipients in each state.

Between July 1 and Sept. 30, there were more than 6,300 full-time equivalent jobs in New Jersey funded by the stimulus in that quarter, according to the website.

Our ruling

In a radio interview, Christie claimed that in Obama’s first two years, the president had ""huge majorities in the House and Senate, and did nothing with them to create jobs in America.""

But Obama and the Democratic-controlled Congress did do something, governor. It’s called the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a stimulus bill that various economists credit with creating or saving jobs.

That’s why it is ridiculous for Christie to claim Obama did ""nothing."" Pants on Fire! To comment on this ruling, go to NJ.com. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/becce145-1294-4e69-bab4-9896b14ad075",/factchecks/2011/dec/04/chris-christie/chris-christie-claims-barack-obama-did-nothing-t/
"['Civil Rights', 'Criminal Justice', 'Terrorism', 'Texas', 'Ron Paul']","
Ron Paul says Defense Department budget changes definitions of al-Qaeda and Taliban, making Americans vulnerable
","
Republican presidential hopeful Ron Paul suggests it’s getting easier for the government to associate nearly anyone with two forces in conflict with the United States.

Paul, a U.S. House member from Texas, said in the Nov. 22, 2011, CNN Republican presidential debate that in the U.S. Department of Defense ""budget, they have changed the wording on the definition of al-Qaeda and Taliban. It's (now) anybody associated with (those) organizations, which means almost anybody can be loosely associated -- so that makes all Americans vulnerable. And now we know that American citizens are vulnerable to assassination.""

We took this as Paul saying a change in federal definitions of these enemy entities means anybody might end up being considered part of them. So, did the Defense Department change its definitions -- with the result Paul bemoans?

Paul campaign spokesman Gary Howard told us by email he wasn’t entirely sure, but assumes Paul was referring to a section of the National Defense Authorization Act of 2012 that won House approval by 322-96 this spring. The Senate approved its version of the act Dec. 1, 2011, requesting a joint conference committee to reach a compromise.

According to the Congressional Research Service, Section 1034 of the House measure ""affirms that the United States is in an armed conflict with al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and associated forces, and that the president is authorized to detain unprivileged enemy belligerents in connection with such conflict until the termination of hostilities.""

Paul objected in a May 30, 2011 ""update"" posted online, saying the language ""explicitly extends the president's war powers to just about anybody."" His commentary continues: ""It doesn't matter if these associated forces are American citizens. Your constitutional rights no longer apply when the United States is ‘at war’ with you. Would it be so hard for someone in the government to target a political enemy and connect them to al-Qaeda, however tenuously, and have them declared an associated force?""

Seeking context, we learned that the cited language traces to the Obama administration’s existing position that so-called associated forces already are fair game under the authorization-of force resolution approved by Congress shortly after 9/11.

The 2001 congressional resolution authorizes the president to ""use all necessary and appropriate force against those nations, organizations, or persons he determines planned, authorized, committed, or aided the terrorist attacks that occurred on September 11, 2001, or harbored such organizations or persons, in order to prevent any future acts of international terrorism against the United States by such nations, organizations or persons.""

Defending the ""associated forces"" language adopted this year by the House, U.S. Rep. Howard ""Buck"" McKeon, R-Calif., chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, wrote Obama on Oct. 20, 2011, saying it was put into the act to ""ensure that there would be no confusion as to the scope of authorities applicable to past and current operations."" His letter adds that ""our men and women in uniform are currently relying on this interpretation everyday to prosecute the war"" and deserve to be on solid legal footing.

A March 2009 court filing by the Obama administration regarding the detention of individuals at Guantanamo Bay says the government interprets the 2001 resolution as giving the president authority to detain not only persons in or substantially supportive of the Taliban or al-Qaeda, but also individuals in or substantially supportive of associated forces ""engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners, including any person who has committed a belligerent act, or has directly supported hostilities in aid of such enemy armed forces.""

Two observers of the authorization act debate, both involved in a blog on national security legal issues, told us the House-approved language codifies the legal position taken by the administration.

Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that because the language reflects the administration’s existing position, it would not amount to huge change. Put another way, he said, if the language fails to pass, the administration would continue to say its approach is congressionally authorized.

Wittes and Professor Robert Chesney of the University of Texas School of Law each disputed Paul’s claim that the House-approved provisions serve to make Americans vulnerable.

If Paul is ""implying that the standard is so broad that anybody could be at risk, that the government has discretion to label people detainable, that, I think, is nonsense,"" Chesney said. ""There’s some overstatement here,"" he said, though Paul fairly points out the lack of a definition of associated forces. Still, Chesney said, it’s ""preposterous to say government has the discretion to detain or even kill whoever it wants.""

Wittes said that under the proposed language, in order to be a vulnerable American you would have to be within an organization plausibly within the specified associated forces. ""That is not a universe of zero,"" Wittes said, offering as an example the government’s killing of a radical cleric and U.S. citizen, Anwar al-Awlaki, in Yemen. ""But it’s not a large set either. To the extent the implication of his statement is the government is authorized to kill any U.S. citizen, that’s not so.""

Our ruling

Paul’s debate warning ties to the House-approved language adding ""associated forces"" to the Taliban and al-Qaeda as permitted U.S. targets--not to the Defense Department’s budget, contrary to his wording.

Most significantly, the U.S. government has laid claim to such authority for about a decade. So even if the cited provisions pass into law, they would not change how the government prosecutes detainees. Also, we saw no evidence that the change would make American non-combatants vulnerable. We rate Paul’s claim Mostly False.

Romney says he followed the law and precedent in deleting e-mails
","
When Mitt Romney left office after four years as Massachusetts governor, his staff took their computer records with them. According to a series of articles published last month in the Boston Globe, they bought their computer hard drives and wiped the administration’s server clean of e-mails and other records.

The maneuvers have left Romney’s successor, current Gov. Deval Patrick, without any digital records from Romney’s administration, and Patrick’s staff has been unable to meet the many public records requests filed during Romney’s presidential campaign, the Globe reported.

But, in an interview last week with The Telegraph’s editorial board, Romney said his staff's actions were legal.

""In government, we should follow the law,"" Romney said in the November 20, 2011 interview.

""There has never been an administration (in Massachusetts) that has provided to the opposition research team, or to the public, electronic communications,"" he said. ""So ours would have been the first administration to have done so.""

Romney’s claims bring up two questions: Did his staff, which reportedly purchased 11 computers,  follow the state public records law? And how have past Massachusetts governors treated electronic records? PolitiFact is on the case.

First, we took a look at Massachusetts' public records law. The law, which requires state officials to preserve records for a set amount of time,  is fairly clear about electronic records. ""The Public Records Law applies to all government records generated, received or maintained electronically, including computer records, electronic mail, video and audiotapes,"" William Galvin, Secretary of the Commonwealth, wrote in a 2009 guide to the state law.

But the Massachusetts governor’s office is not subject to these regulations, according to the state Supreme Court.

In 1997, the court issued a ruling that effectively exempts the governor’s office from the public records law's requirements. In the ruling, Ann K. Lambert vs. Executive Director of the Judicial Nominating Council, the court determined that judicial nomination documents submitted to the state's governor are not public because the governor’s office is not ""explicitly included"" in the state records law.

""Were we to conclude that the public records law included the records ..., a conflict could arise between the legislation and the executive order which could impair the Governor’s ability to exercise his constitutional responsibility,"" the justices wrote.

In the years since, this decision hasn’t stopped governors from submitting records to the state archives, according to former staff members.
.
Both before and after the Lambert decision, administration staff members, including those under Romney, have submitted records to the state archives, according to Terry Dolan, who served as director of administration for six governors, including Romney, between 1985 and 2008.

But to her recollection, none of the former governors -- Michael Dukakis, William Weld, Paul Cellucci, Jane Swift nor Romney -- have submitted electronic records to the archives. Nor have state record-keepers received any, according to Brian McNiff, a spokesman for the Secretary of the Commonwealth, who oversees the public records division.

As they left office, each of the governors submitted hundreds of boxes of paper records to the records center, said Dolan, who now works at Northeastern University’s Dukakis Center for Urban and Regional Policy. The only electronic records and communications that were included were when the governor's staff included printouts of some of them, she said.

McNiff, of the Secretary of the Commonwealth’s office, said records submitted from the Romney administration included print-outs of electronic records.

It would be tough to track how many, but it’s ""safe to say e-mail printouts do not make up the bulk of material,"" McNiff wrote in an e-mail.

As for whether governors leave records for incoming administrations, Dolan said staff members routinely passed along some documents, both electronic and physical, which may prove valuable to the incoming governor. Some records, including those involving ongoing legislation, legal cases and gubernatorial appointments, extended into the following administration, she said, and governors, including Romney, passed those along to their successors.

But, aside from those, staffers generally cleared all staff computers of past records during the transition period, Dolan said.

""That was the routine,"" she said. ""Computers to the best of my recollection would be re-imaged and old files deleted between administrations. … You wouldn’t just start up your computer and find files waiting there.""

Our ruling

The Romney administration’s decision to erase most electronic files is neither illegal nor unusual. According to state records officials, past governors such as Weld, Cellucci and Swift have not made their electronic records available to the state archive or to the incoming administration, according to state staff. They have submitted some computer print-outs to the state archive, but Romney did that, as well. So we rate Romney's claim True. 
UPDATE: The last paragraph originally included a reference to to the removal of the hard drives. That reference has been removed to clarify that ruling is on Romney's claim about deleting the records. ",/factchecks/2011/dec/02/mitt-romney/romney-says-he-followed-law-and-precedent-taking-h/

Rick Santorum says he called for resignation of a high-ranking Republican over no vote on balanced budget amendment
","
A Republican lodestar this year is passage of a balanced budget amendment, a constitutional change requiring Washington to balance its books every year, with some exceptions, such as if the country is at war.

So far, the proposal has failed to get the two-thirds majority required in the U.S. House, falling short in a 261-165 vote on Nov. 18, 2011.

It’s slated to be voted on by the Senate in December -- a vote was a requirement of last summer’s debt-ceiling deal -- but two-thirds passage there is unlikely given that the chamber is controlled by Democrats, even though some have supported it in the past.

Even if the measure were to clear Congress, it would still need approval from legislatures in 38 states to become part of the Constitution.

Nonetheless, it remains a key talking point for Republicans on the presidential campaign trail. And in a Nov. 29, 2011, op-ed in the New Hampshire Union Leader, former Sen. Rick Santorum, R-Pa., asserted that the balanced budget amendment came within one vote of passing Congress and going to the states during his first year in the Senate. He also said that he’s not afraid to expose fellow Republicans who stand in its way.

""The best part of my plan to balance the budget is that it will actually work,"" Santorum wrote. ""The first bill I cosponsored in the Senate was the balanced budget amendment, but we came within one vote of passing it. Sadly, the Senate Appropriations Committee chairman, a Republican, was the deciding ‘no’ vote. I stood up and called for him to resign his chairmanship because I am not afraid to lead, fight for fiscal responsibility and expose members of my own party when they spend like liberals.""

Did that really happen? And was there really a Senate Appropriations Committee chairman who dared to buck his party on this key issue?

Santorum campaign aide Matt Benyon said his boss was referring to a vote in 1995, Santorum’s first year in the Senate, and that the Republican in question was the late Mark Hatfield, who died in August 2011 at 89.

Santorum on Jan. 4, 1995, became a co-sponsor of the balanced budget amendment in the Senate. This was the era when Republicans, led by Newt Gingrich’s Contract With America, had swept into power in the House and Senate, and the amendment, then as now, was a major part of their agenda.

It passed the House, with more than the two-thirds majority required, on a 300-132 vote on Jan. 26, 1995, but failed  to reach the two-thirds mark by one vote in the U.S. Senate on a 65-35 vote on March 2, 1995.

While several Democrats voted for the measure -- including then-U.S. Sens. Joe Biden, D-Del., and Paul Simon, D-Ill., and current Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa -- the lone Republican to oppose the measure was Hatfield. The Oregon Republican and the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, called the measure a ""procedural gimmick.""

Santorum, then only 36 (the New York Times pointed out that Hatfield was first elected governor of Oregon in 1958,  the year Santorum was born), called for the veteran lawmaker to be stripped of his committee leadership, as did some other young Republican Turks.

""He can vote against the balanced-budget amendment. But he shouldn’t be in leadership,"" Santorum said at the time.

""This is an issue that is at the core of what Republicanism is all about … I see this as a major stumbling block in the way of the agenda.""

For his part, Hatfield, who had served in the Senate for 28 years at that point, stood his ground, saying, ""I do not care for the implication -- and I only say implication -- that perhaps a conscience vote is no longer possible on the Republican side of the aisle.""

A variety of senior Republican lawmakers, ranging from North Carolina’s Jesse Helms to Vermont’s Jim Jeffords, spoke in favor of Hatfield's right to break ranks on the issue.

Defending Hatfield at the time, Jeffords told the Times, ""He is a moderate, and moderates can make or break this Senate. Either we can have compromise, or we can have gridlock.""

Hatfield held onto his committee chairmanship, though he opted not to run for a sixth term in 1996.

Our ruling

Santorum was correct in stating the balanced budget amendment came within one vote of clearing Congress and that the vote by the Republican chairman of the Senate Appropriations committee against it was key to its failure to pass. Hatfield said he opposed it because he viewed it as a ""gimmick."" And Santorum and others did call for Hatfield's resignation as committee chairman. Santorum's description of his role as evidence of his leadership skills is an opinion, and we don't check opinions. But he has the basic history right.

Is Oregon really No. 6 on the estate tax rate list among states?
","
This online post caught our attention and we figure it will get yours too, since it has to do with death and taxes and we all know the lure of that combination. The statement comes from the Oregon Transformation Project, launched in 2010 by state Republicans to talk state budget and spending.
  
""The federal death tax rate in this country is currently 35%.  There are 22 states that impose an additional tax on top of the federal rate with a state death tax, including Oregon. 
So, for the folks who qualify for this death tax, what is the tax penalty for dying in the state of Oregon?  Nearly half of a lifetime’s savings. 
Oregon has the sixth highest combined death tax rate in the country."" 

Yikes. That’s some heavy boldface italicizing. What’s this tax all about and why is it so high in Oregon? We dug in. 

The ""death tax,"" for those unfamiliar with the term, is really the estate tax in IRS talk. The federal government exempts the first $5 million of a person’s estate but will take 35 percent on the rest. Nearly two dozen states assess separate estate or inheritance taxes, ranging from 1 percent to 16 percent.

Oregon and Washington are among those states. The tax rate in Oregon tops out at 16 percent, with an exemption on the first $1 million. The Oregon Legislature adjusted its taxable brackets and rates earlier this year, to make it more equitable to those on the low end. For example, under current law a taxable estate of $1.1 million pays nearly $39,000 in taxes. Under the new law, the amount will be $10,000. (Our ""It’s Only Money"" columnist has a terrific read on what this means for most Oregonians.)

We’re not weighing in on the fairness of calling this a death tax. But we do want to know whether we have the sixth highest combined tax rate in the country. In other words, are there 44 other states lower than Oregon?  

Oregon Transformation credits the Wall Street Journal with a chart that lists Oregon as one of a dozen states at the No. 6 spot. The Journal link goes to an opinion that links to a report by the American Family Business Institute. The institute -- located at www.nodeathtax.org/-- published a paper this year that studied the 22 states that assess a separate estate or inheritance tax.

The report listed the state, exemption amount, range of tax rates, and the ""top effective rate,"" based on the top statutory rate for each state.

But American Family did not rank the states.

A footnote in the report explains that the top effective rates are ""highly fluid,"" and affected by several factors, including the state’s exemption amount, the size of the estate and estate planning. State estate taxes are deductible on federal tax returns.

""It is tough to rank states on an ordinal scale because the taxing methods and exemptions differ,"" said Charles Chamberlayne of American Family in an email. Federal affairs director Palmer Schoening said the same over the phone: ""It's not really fair to compare them.""

Oregon, for example, is one of six states with a $1 million threshold and a top tax rate of 16 percent. That tax rate in Washington tops out at 19 percent, but the threshold is higher at $2 million. New Jersey exempts $675,000, rather than $1 million. You get the idea.

The highest possible combined rate in Oregon is 45.4 percent. If we accept the report’s numbers, Oregon shares the No. 6 spot with 11 other states. New Jersey is the highest at 54.1 percent and Ohio is the lowest at 39.6 percent. (Ohio will not have an estate tax starting in 2013.)

But are we really sixth highest if we share that distinction with 11 other states, especially if that ranking only covers the high end?

Lindsay Berschauer, who did the research for Oregon Transformation and wrote the post, acknowledged that the ranking system is convoluted, given the variety of tax brackets and exemptions. But she said it’s accurate to say that ""at our highest state death tax bracket ($9.5 million), Oregon ranks 6th highest nationwide in tax rate for highest brackets.""

We want to give Oregon Transformation credit for its general argument. It’s true that Oregon has an estate tax, putting our state ahead of many states that do not. For some people with a lot of money, it’s probably more costly to die here than in, say, California.

But based on the data, we can’t agree with the Oregon Transformation Project.

Even the people who did the original report say there are too many variables to determine an ordinal ranking. Even if we abide by Oregon Transformation’s narrow definition, to say we’re No. 6 ignores 11 other states that also are at No. 6. Even if the ""top statutory effective rate,"" or the highest combined possible rate, is nearly 50 percent, very few people in Oregon will ever pay that.

For tax year 2009, only some 15 estates out of 1,000 had the 16 percent rate assessed on any portion of their estate, according to Mazen Malik of Oregon’s Legislative Revenue Office. Because chunks of estates are taxed at different rates, a person’s taxable estate needs to be more than $500 million for 16 percent of the estate to be due.

We think those are all critical facts that would give a different impression about how our estate tax measures up to other states. Since the statement contains an element of truth we rate it Mostly False.

Joe Biden says Iraq violence 'is down to an all-time low' since start of war
","
On the Dec. 1, 2011, edition of NBC’s Today, Ann Curry sat down with Vice President Joe Biden while on a trip to Baghdad.

Curry asked Biden, ""How secure can Iraq really be when you as a vice president still must arrive under the cloak of darkness, under heavy security?""

Biden responded that there are ""still concerns here in Iraq, but if you take a look at it, Ann, violence is down to an all-time low, to all the way back to 2002. We're in a situation where it's been that way for the last year and a half, but there's still the one-off jobs that can occur.""

Indeed, during Biden’s trip, there were two separate attacks in northeast Iraq, killing 20 people and wounding 32, according to the Associated Press.

A reader asked us to check whether violence is in fact ""down to an all-time low"" since the start of the war.

We turned to two sources: the ""Iraq Index: Tracking Variables of Reconstruction & Security in Post-Saddam Iraq,"" a project of the Brookings Institution that assembles a wide array of data about Iraq, and icasualties.org, an independent accounting of casualty statistics in Iraq and Afghanistan.

We found that by most metrics, Biden is correct. But there are a few that show violence has increased -- though not dramatically -- from post-2002 lows.

First, we’ll list the data that supports Biden’s claim.

• U.S. troop fatalities. The number of U.S. troop fatalities in 2011 -- 53 -- is on pace to roughly match, or perhaps slightly fall short of, its level from 2010, which was 60. That was easily the lowest level since the war began, compared with the peak of 961 in 2007. There have been no troops killed by IEDs for three months running; none killed by mortars, rockets or rocket-propelled grenades for four months running; and none killed by car bombs since April 2009.

• U.S. troops wounded in action. Citing Defense Department statistics, the Brookings study shows a steady decline in the number of U.S. troops wounded in action. Through the end of August 2011, there were 213 U.S. troops wounded, which is on a pace to fall short of the total for 2010, which was 389. That compares with a peak of 8,005 in 2004.

• Estimated number of Iraqi civilian fatalities. The chart in the report shows this number at less than 250 per month for roughly the past year. The number peaked at about 3,700 per month in late 2006, and was 1,000 a month as recently as mid 2008.

• Non-Iraqi civilians killed. This number -- which includes civilian contractors -- has been in the low single digits per month since mid 2008, after peaking at 31 in a single month in mid 2004.

• Foreign nationals kidnapped in Iraq. There was one kidnapping in 2008, none in 2009, and one in 2010. This number peaked at 149 in 2004.

• Journalists killed in Iraq. The total so far in 2011 is five, the same as the number for 2010. This number peaked with 32 in 2006 and 2007.

 Here are three areas for which today’s numbers are not the lowest since 2002.

• Iraqi military and police killed. In June, July and August 2011, at least 50 Iraqi military and police were killed each month, which had been below 50 for most months since fall 2008.

• Multiple-fatality bombings. This number has jumped around more than most. From the start of 2008 to the spring of 2011, the number has ranged from eight to 26 per month, with no discernible pattern.

• Insurgent attacks in Baghdad. While the current level is far below its peak in mid 2007, the trendline has been edging slowly but consistently upward since early 2009.

The researcher who put together the Brookings report told PolitiFact that Biden generally has the evidence on his side.

""There’s little doubt that violence – while considerable still – has been lower over the past year or two"" despite the exit of many American troops, said Ian Livingston, who works with fellow Brookings scholar Michael O’Hanlon on the report. Still, while current levels are ""many, many-fold lower than the peak,"" Livingston said, bombings ""are still pretty much a daily occurrence.""

Our ruling

Not every statistic supports Biden’s statement that in Iraq, ""violence is down to an all-time low"" since the start of the war. But most of the statistics do. We rate his statement Mostly True.",/factchecks/2011/dec/02/joe-biden/joe-biden-says-iraq-violence-down-all-time-low-sta/
"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Texas', 'David Frum']","
David Frum says foreign-born individuals filled 80 percent of the Texas jobs added from 2009 into 2011
","Commentator David Frum, exploring the state of his Republican Party, recently wrote that disaffected white voters have ""been plunged into a mood of pessimism and anger since 2008."" One reason is that U.S. employers lately prefer foreign-born workers, Frum said in his Nov. 29, 2011, New York magazine article titled ""When did the GOP lose touch with reality?""

Adding a Texas touch, Frum said: ""Eighty percent of the net new jobs created in the state of Texas since 2009 went to the foreign-born.""

That many? We were curious.

On Frum’s behalf, Noah Kristula-Green, managing editor of the online FrumForum, told us that he relied on a September 2011 memo posted by the Center for Immigration Studies, a think tank that supports reducing illegal immigration. That memo, drawing on information gathered by the Current Population Survey taken by the U.S. Census Bureau, states that 81 percent of the jobs created in Texas since 2007 — not 2009, as Frum writes — ""were taken by newly arrived immigrants (legal and illegal).""

By email, Frum told us that his two-year misstatement was a typo.

And how did the center come to its estimate of immigrants filling new Texas jobs?

The memo says that total Texas employment increased by 279,000 between the second quarter of 2007, right before the national recession began, and the second quarter of 2011, the most recent quarter for which data were available. And, it says, answers to the surveys taken by the Census Bureau suggest that immigrants who arrived in the United States in 2007 or later filled 225,000 of the gained jobs.

The memo estimates that half of those 225,000 newly arrived immigrants were in Texas illegally — a conclusion traced in part to assuming illegal residents are disproportionately young, male, unmarried, younger than 40 and have little schooling. It says too that, over all, 40 percent of the jobs gained in Texas over the four years went to recent legal immigrants with 40 percent filled by illegal immigrants.

Generally, the memo says, this ""means that in Texas — one of the few states that experienced job growth after 2007 — native-born workers benefited little from this growth.""

Then again, as noted by PolitiFact in an October 2011 fact check considering the memo,  the center’s researcher, Steve Camarota, presented calculations using two sets of numbers. The one that Frum relied upon solely took into account immigrants who recently came to the state. Another calculation took that tally and subtracted immigrant departures and deaths--concluding that the net increase in 150,000 immigrant workers over the four years equaled 53.6 percent of the overall growth of 279,000 jobs.

Jeffrey S. Passel, senior demographer for the Pew Hispanic Center, an independent research organization, separately told PolitiFact that there are ""lots of methodological problems with the CIS study, mainly having to do with the limitations of small sample sizes and the fact that the estimates are determined by taking differences of differences based on small sample sizes.""

In October 2011, the conservative-leaning Texas Public Policy Foundation issued a paper critical of the center’s analysis. Author Chuck DeVore conceded that Texas saw a net job gain of 279,000 in the period. But, DeVore said, there’s no statistical way to conclude how many of the jobs were taken by immigrants. Among his points: The number of Texas jobs churned considerably over the four years, with employees shifting positions as well.

Before DeVore’s critique surfaced, the Dallas Morning News quoted Pia Orrenius, an economist and immigration expert at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, calling the methodology behind the 81 percent figure ""misleading."" Orrenius was quoted as saying the center’s second methodology — the one suggesting that 54 percent of gained jobs were filled by immigrants — was more reliable and also ""typical for the nation.""

Mark Krikorian, the Center for Immigration Studies' executive director, told PolitiFact that regardless of methodological preferences, ""immigrants still got a disproportionate share of new jobs"" in Texas. In our follow-up, Camarota stood by his work.

Our ruling

Aside from having the wrong starting date for the studied period, Frum’s statement relies on a methodology that isolated immigrants recently arrived in Texas, disregarding immigrant departures and deaths and leaving the 80 percent figure in question. Then again, no one has disputed that recent immigrants filled a surprising share (more than half) of the added jobs.

"['Immigration', 'National', 'Mitt Romney']","
Does Newt Gingrich support amnesty? Mitt Romney says his plan goes there
","
There’s an ""A"" word in the Republican primary for president -- ""amnesty.""

When Newt Gingrich outlined a more flexible immigration policy at a CNN debate on Nov. 22, 2011, his opponents seized the chance to brand him an amnesty supporter.

Mitt Romney said the next day that Gingrich ""offered a new doorway to amnesty last night, which as I said last night in my view is the wrong course for a Republican debate.""

About a week later, Romney repeated his criticism of Gingrich in an interview with Brett Baier of Fox News. ""If he's going to do what I believe he said he was going to do for those people who would be allowed to stay permanently and become citizens, that would be providing for them a form of amnesty,"" Romney said.

We decided to investigate the amnesty charge, to see if it was an accurate way to describe Gingrich’s policies. 
Before we go any further, we need to take a stab at defining amnesty. Merriam Webster defines amnesty as ""the act of an authority (as a government) by which pardon is granted to a large group of individuals.""

In recent American politics, though, the usual standard for amnesty is the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986. That law, supported by President Ronald Reagan, said that illegal immigrants could become legal permanent residents if they could prove they were in this country by Jan. 1, 1982, and met a few other minimal requirements. The law was widely described as an ""amnesty"" program, both then and now. 
Gingrich’s vision for immigration policy is that it takes place in steps, with the first step of securing the border between the U.S. and Mexico. He also supports a program for guest workers, to allow foreign nationals into the United States to work. Finally, some illegal immigrants would be allowed to stay.

""Once you've put every piece in place, which includes the guest worker program, you need something like a World War II Selective Service Board that, frankly, reviews the people who are here,"" Gingrich said at the debate. ""If you've come here recently, you have no ties to this country, you ought to go home, period. If you've been here 25 years and you got three kids and two grandkids, you've been paying taxes and obeying the law, (and) you belong to a local church, I don't think we're going to separate you from your family, uproot you forcefully and kick you out.

""The Krieble Foundation has a very good red card program that says you get to be legal, but you don't get a pass to citizenship. And so there's a way to ultimately end up with a country where there's no more illegality, but you haven't automatically given amnesty to anyone.""

Gringrich’s sets a higher bar for allowing people to stay than the law under Reagan. Based on his comments at the debate and a detailed 10-point plan on his website, Gingrich says his proposal isn’t amnesty for several reasons: It is not citizenship but legal residency; immigrants would have to prove ""deep ties to America, including family, church and community ties;"" and they would pay a fine of at least $5,000.

In the course of our research, we noticed that advocates for more legal immigration often used this distinction. In their view, amnesty means widespread legalization with few requirements. A path to legality or earned legalization, on the other hand, includes fines, waiting periods, proof of English language proficiency, criminal background checks and other criteria.

Romney, on the other hand, has defined amnesty as giving any kind of special preference to people who are now in the country illegally.

""My view is that those people who have waited in line patiently to come to this country legally should be ahead in line, and those who’ve come here illegally should not be given a special deal or a special accelerated right to become a permanent resident or citizen,"" Romney said the day after the debate.

Those who oppose more immigration tend to agree with Romney.

""Anything that turns an illegal resident into a legal resident one way or another is an amnesty,"" said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, which supports low levels of immigration, when we asked him about this.

After the debate, Krikorian scolded Gingrich in a blog post on the National Review Online for claiming his plan wasn’t amnesty: ""If you want to make a case for amnestying long-established illegal aliens, that can be an honorable position, but call it for what it is. Don’t lie to voters, imagining they’re too stupid to see through your deceit.""

On the other side of the issue is Tamar Jacoby of ImmigrationWorks USA, which represents businesses who favor more immigration. She said Gingrich’s avoidance of the loaded term amnesty was understandable, since his plan is limited and requires illegal immigrants to meet various requirements.

She praised Gingrich for his honesty. ""He’s getting pilloried for saying we can’t deport 11 million people,"" she said. ""At least Newt is saying, ‘There’s a problem here, let’s come to grips with it.’ ""

During Romney’s recent interview with Fox News, Baier pressed Romney about what he would do with the roughly 11 million illegal immigrants who are already in the country, noting that Romney has stopped short of urging mass deportation in past interviews.

""You know, there's great interest on the part of some to talk about what we do with the 11 million. My interest is saying, let's make sure that we secure the border, and we don't do anything that talks about bringing in a new wave of those or attracting a new wave of people into the country illegally,"" Romney said.

Our ruling

""Amnesty"" has become a radioactive term in American politics, and Republicans in particular do not want their immigration policies described that way. Gingrich supports allowing illegal immigrants who have been in the United States for many years to apply for legal status. He’s said that process should look at each individual and whether they have ""family, church and community ties."" They would also have to pay a fine. What he describes sounds like a more restrictive process than the 1986 law supported by Reagan that allowed for widespread amnesty.

Still, the word amnesty means simply forgiving groups of people who have broken the law. Most legal amnesties include some sort of process. Words matter, and under a more straightforward definition, Gingrich’s plan is clearly amnesty, though it may be limited in scope.

Romney said that Gingrich's plan offers ""a new doorway to amnesty,"" which suggests that Gingrich's plan allows for legalization without being the same as the older amnesty law.

One Wisconsin Now says it’s legal to sign Walker recall petitions more than once
","
The liberal group One Wisconsin Now, worried about possible confusion over who can sign petitions to recall Gov. Scott Walker, issued a ""recall petitioners’ rights"" memo in late November 2011.

The group said you only have to be a qualified voter in Wisconsin; you don’t have to have voted here before or even have registered to vote.

Mildly surprising to some perhaps, but the next claim really jumped out.

The group wrote: ""You can circulate or sign a recall petition even if you have already signed another recall petition (note, however, that only one signature per person will be counted).""

Can you really sign a petition twice?

And will it count for one signature -- or none, or two -- if you pen your name on separate petitions?

It’s one of many points, from both sides, that has prompted confusion -- and accusations that opponents are misleading folks for their advantage. We already looked at a few process-related questions.

Here’s one more.

In state statutes, the recall law (Section 9.10) lists eight ways a signature could be nullified. Among them: It’s not dated, was too early or late, the signer lives out of state, the address can’t be confirmed.

There was nothing noted about a case of multiple signatures.

But deeper in the statute, we found an answer: ""If a challenger can establish that a person signed the recall petition more than once, the 2nd and subsequent signatures may not be counted.""

That means the first signature is still good, but duplicates can be thrown out, said Reid Magney, spokesman for the Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections the recall process.

That doesn’t guarantee they will be. It’s up to the incumbent to challenge the validity of signatures.

The state Accountability Board will review the petitions, but isn’t staffed to systematically check for duplicates, Magney said. That puts the onus on the gatherers or Walker’s side.

If people do sign more than once, they face no penalties.

""There are no legal restrictions,"" Magney said.

That doesn't speak to practical concerns.

Magney, for instance, noted that people signing more than once could put their own cause in jeopardy because that falsely inflates the true number of signatures.

Magney said the Government Accountability Board is not encouraging people to sign multiple times. But he added there is an instance in which they could be justified in doing so.

""People should not sign a petition more than once unless they have some good faith reason to believe that the first petition was somehow fraudulent and believes the circulator doesn’t intend to file it,"" Magney said.

Magney said the agency has tried to make that clear after an anonymous Facebook group (Operation Burn Notice) said it believed ""burning recall petitions is fun and games.""

One Wisconsin Now’s executive director, Scot Ross, cited the same motive for publicizing the fact that signing twice is not illegal.

The group is concerned about fraud, especially illegal destruction of recall petitions. Ross said One Wisconsin Now supports but is not directly involved in gathering signatures as the Democratic Party and allied groups push to get 540,208 valid signatures by Jan. 14, 2012, when the 60-day period closes.

On the right, recall critics including the Republican Party of Wisconsin, and the MacIver Institute for Public Policy, have raised a different set of concerns.

Also citing Facebook chatter, they have raised alarms about fraud and double counting, contending that some duplicates will not be weeded out by state officials.

""Without a systematic review of signatures, how will we know if the proper process was followed and the threshold for recall was reached legally?"" Brett Healy, president of the MacIver Institute, told us. ""What is to stop someone from signing a petition three times or 30 times?""

Magney said the state agency will look for obvious cases of fraud.

Our conclusion

We can’t predict whether all multiple signers will be found, but state law makes clear that one -- and only one -- signature is to be counted. And it’s perfectly legal to sign more than once. That was the focus of the statement from One Wisconsin Now.

We rate it True.",/factchecks/2011/dec/02/one-wisconsin-now/one-wisconsin-now-says-its-legal-sign-walker-recal/

Loretta Weinberg criticizes Chris Christie for not making any pension payments
","
Sen. Loretta Weinberg isn’t shy about attacking Gov. Chris Christie, but when it comes to him not making pension payments, she could show a little patience.

The Bergen County Democrat took aim in a recent column on bluejersey.com at the Republican governor’s record of making no payments to the state’s pension funds.

""He has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system, and then states that the system is broke,"" Weinberg wrote in a Nov. 21 column on the left-leaning blog.

PolitiFact New Jersey determined that Weinberg’s claim is technically correct, but still somewhat misleading.

The Christie administration has not yet made a pension contribution, but a payment of nearly $500 million is scheduled to be made before the current fiscal year ends in June 2012. That amount represents a fraction of the nearly $3.4 billion needed to fully fund the state’s fiscal year contribution.

Even though one is scheduled, Weinberg argued in a phone interview that Christie has not made any pension payments.

""Whether he’ll do it in the future, we’ll see,"" said Weinberg, before referring to her statement. ""I don’t think it’s misleading....It’s a statement of fact.""

Let’s review Christie’s track record with the pension system.

In the fiscal year 2011 budget -- Christie’s first spending plan -- the governor did not make any pension contributions, even though a payment of about $3 billion was required to fully fund the state’s share in that fiscal year.

But in March 2010, Christie signed a law passed by the Democratic-controlled Legislature, requiring the state to make one-seventh of the full contribution. That policy kicks off with fiscal year 2012, which began in July of this year.

The state’s payment is slated to increase by at least an additional one-seventh in each succeeding fiscal year until the full amount is paid in the seventh fiscal year and afterwards.

Christie approved a fiscal year 2012 budget that includes that one-seventh payment for a combined contribution of about $484 million to six pension funds. The full contribution would be nearly $3.4 billion.

In fact, Weinberg also agreed to make a pension payment by way of voting for the fiscal year 2012 budget.

The actual payment will be made at some point during the next seven months in order to use cash on hand, according to Andrew Pratt, a Treasury Department spokesman. Making the pension payment now would likely mean borrowing money, Pratt said.

Historically, pension payments are made in the final few weeks of a fiscal year, Pratt told us. Toward the end of a fiscal year, more tax revenue is coming in and most other expenses have been paid, he said.

""It’s a fiscally prudent thing to do,"" Pratt said. ""It’s always better to pay in cash."" 
State officials also approved pension and health benefit reform last summer, requiring greater employee contributions toward the benefits. The Christie administration has said the reform would save $120 billion in pension costs over the next 30 years. 
Our ruling

In an online column, Weinberg claimed Christie ""has not paid one dollar of state money into our pension system.""

It’s technically true that Christie has not yet made a pension contribution, but the governor has agreed to make a combined payment of about $484 million to six pension funds during fiscal year 2012.

Once upon a time -- about a month and a half ago -- Cain was surging to the top of the polls. He was the toast of the talk show circuit, and his 9-9-9 tax reform plan was the talk of the town.

Cain repeated over and again that his plan was not ""regressive.""

""[I]t is not regressive on the poor,"" he told the hosts of ABC’s ""The View "" Oct. 4.

""It's not regressive,"" he told CNN Oct 13.

""[T]hey try to say -- ‘Well, it’s going to be regressive on the poor.’ No, it’s not,"" he told a crowd in Las Vegas on Oct. 19.

Cain’s ""9-9-9 the Movie,"" a breezy five-minute cartoon released Monday, brings up the fate of the poor again.

""Americans in lower tax brackets right now will have even more opportunities to move up as the economy takes off,"" it says.

So, we wondered, is 9-9-9 ""regressive""?  

There’s a bit of ideological dispute on what counts as a regressive tax. Some see it as one that taxes people at lower income levels at a higher rate than those who are wealthier.

The Internal Revenue Service describes it as ""a tax that takes a larger percentage of income from low-income groups than from high-income groups.""

And most economists agree that a regressive tax forces lower-earning taxpayers to pay a greater percentage of their income than higher earners. Some cite a national sales tax as an example. Because low- and middle-income households consume more of their income than higher-income households do, proportionally speaking, they have a greater tax burden.

We looked at our past 9-9-9 coverage and other analysis. We found that while in most cases, personal tax rates will be the same regardless of how much money a person makes, it will change the lives of individuals on opposite ends of the income spectrum in very different ways.

Our sister site PolitiFact National examined the plan. Based on the campaign’s statements, income tax exemptions will be for charitable deductions and ""empowerment"" zones that aim to encourage inner-city development.

Cain’s 9 percent income tax would replace payroll taxes, which are paid by all workers toward Medicare and Social Security benefits. It would also end the estate tax.

The 9 percent sales tax would apply to new goods, but not used goods. Payroll taxes on workers would go away. And if you’re like about half of the country and pay no income tax, there’s a good chance you’d start doing so under 9-9-9.  

An Oct. 18 analysis by the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center offers perhaps the most detailed look at the plan. The group, which is made up of tax experts from Republican and Democratic administrations, found that Americans with top incomes would fare far better than the rest of us.

Or, as Tax Policy Center analyst Howard Gleckman wrote, ""Herman Cain’s 9-9-9 tax plan would result in a massive tax cut for nearly all of the highest-earning Americans and a steep average tax hike for everyone else.""

They looked at 9-9-9 based on income level and found nearly 84 percent of tax filers would get a tax increase under Cain’s plan, compared with current tax policy. More than 95 percent of those who make more than $1 million would get a tax cut.

PolitiFact National posted data for filers who make $75,000 or less on its site.

Now, there are a few caveats.

After the Tax Policy Center released its analysis, Cain’s camp said households below the poverty level could claim a deduction. The center asked several times for more details on this deduction, but the campaign ""did not define clearly how that deduction would work,"" they wrote. Their analysis therefore does not take into account this deduction.

The center also had to fill in a few blanks about 9-9-9 to analyze the plan according to its standard economic model.

Cain may release more details that could cause these estimates to change, but we found none so far. His cartoon says that 9-9-9 turns the entire country into an ""opportunity zone,"" creates exemptions for people ""starting at the poverty line,"" and creates incentives for ""the most economically distressed areas.""

But beyond that, there are few additional details on his website or in any other statement we reviewed.  

Other analyses have come up with similar results as the Tax Policy Center.

Before the Tax Policy Center released its results, PolitiFact Florida asked three tax accountants to take a look at a claim that under 9-9-9, taxes for filers that make $50,000 would fare better. They found the claim is only correct in certain instances and that Cain was cherry-picking his numbers.

Bruce Bartlett was once a senior policy analyst to Ronald Reagan, but now is critical of the president’s approach to economics. He said that ""The poor would pay more while the rich would have their taxes cut, with no guarantee that economic growth will increase and good reason to believe that the budget deficit will increase.""

Incidentally, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants did rough calculations for Yahoo News and concluded that billionaire business mogul Warren Buffett would likely pay no income taxes.

We were unable to find any independent analysis that said 9-9-9 would have the same consequences for lower-income Americans as higher-income ones.

Cain says the personal income flat tax is not ""regressive,"" and technically speaking, all but the poor will be taxed at the same rate. (How he’ll handle the poor remains unclear.)

Still, under Cain’s 9-9-9 plan, low- and middle-income taxpayers will pay a greater share of their income on taxes than their wealthier counterparts. This fits the definition of ""regressive.""

Republican consultant says Barack Obama promised to halve federal deficit in his first term
","
Republican consultant Matt Mackowiak casts the 2012 presidential race as a tilt between Republicans for limited government and Democrats pushing expanded government.

In an opinion article published Dec. 1, 2011, in the Austin American-Statesman, Mackowiak says President Barack Obama ""has talked a good game about deficit reduction, but his actions have demonstrated a clear disregard for record deficits and our $15 trillion debt."" And his piece includes this checkable claim: ""Obama promised to halve the deficit by the end of his first term. He didn't.""

The annual deficit, meaning the difference between what the government is spending and what it’s raising from taxes and other sources, has grown on Obama’s watch. According to a White House historical table, the deficit was $458.6 billion in 2008, the year he won election. It reached $1.4 trillion in 2009, a year over which he and his predecessor, George W. Bush, both held budgetary sway. 
The deficit was nearly $1.3 trillion in 2010. And according to a November 2011 report by the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, the deficit was also $1.3 trillion for fiscal 2011, which ran through September 2011.

And did the Democratic president promise to cut the deficit in half?

Bingo. PolitiFact noted in a June 2011 fact check that Obama said at a ""fiscal responsibility"" summit at the White House in February 2009: ""I'm pledging to cut the deficit we inherited by half by the end of my first term in office.""

Obama continued: ""Now, this will not be easy. It will require us to make difficult decisions and face challenges we've long neglected. But I refuse to leave our children with a debt that they cannot repay, and that means taking responsibility right now, in this administration, for getting our spending under control.""

Earlier in his remarks, Obama said his administration had ""inherited a $1.3 trillion deficit—the largest in our nation's history.""

After making his pledge, Obama said the budget he would soon propose ""will look ahead 10 years and will include a full and honest accounting of the money we plan to spend and the deficits we will likely incur. To start reducing these deficits, I've committed to going through our budget line by line to root out waste and inefficiency.""

Obama went on to say he was intent on restoring pay-as-you-go budgeting and also ending the ""payments to agribusiness that don't need them and eliminate the no-bid contracts that have wasted billions in Iraq. We'll end the tax breaks for companies shipping jobs overseas,"" he said, ""and we'll stop the fraud and abuse in our Medicare program.""

"['National', 'Poverty', 'Newt Gingrich']","
Newt Gingrich says you can use food stamps to get to Hawaii
","In an appearance in Council Bluffs, Iowa, on Nov. 30, 2011, Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich reiterated one of the themes he often brings up on the campaign trail -- food stamps.

Gingrich garnered national attention in May when he said that President Barack Obama deserves to be called ""the most successful food stamp president in American history"" because ""47 million Americans are on food stamps."" (We ruled that claim Half True because Gingrich was close on the number but wrong in assigning so much of the blame to Obama.)

In his Council Bluffs speech -- at a ""slice the deficit"" pizza party sponsored by a group called Strong America Now -- Gingrich added a new twist. According to NBC News campaign ""embed"" Alexandra Moe, Gingrich said this:

""Remember, this is the best food stamp president in history. So more Americans today get food stamps than before. And we now give it away as cash -- you don't get food stamps. You get a credit card, and the credit card can be used for anything. We have people who take their food stamp money and use it to go to Hawaii. They give food stamps now to millionaires because, after all, don't you want to be compassionate? You know, the Obama model: isn't there somebody you'd like to give money to this week. That's why we're now going to help bailout Italy because we haven't bailed out enough people this week, the president thought let's write another check. After all, we have so much extra money.""

We decided to check three separate claims:

Can food stamps ""be used for anything""?

No. The food stamp program -- which, we should point out, has officially been known as the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, since October 2008 -- has very precise rules about what can and cannot be paid for.

According to the Agriculture Department, which runs SNAP, households can use benefits to buy groceries or to buy seeds and plants which produce food. (In some places where subsistence fishing is the norm, such as remote areas of Alaska, recipients can also pay for nets, hooks, fishing line, rods, harpoons and knives.) And in some areas, restaurants can be authorized to accept SNAP benefits from qualified homeless, elderly, or disabled people in exchange for low-cost meals.

But in general, SNAP funds cannot be used for restaurant meals. Other types of foods and beverages cannot be paid for with SNAP funds, including beer, wine or liquor; vitamins; food that will be eaten in the store; or hot foods.
   
According to the rules, ""pumpkins are edible and eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits. However, inedible gourds and pumpkins that are used solely for ornamental purposes are not eligible items."" And ""items such as birthday and other special occasion cakes are eligible for purchase with SNAP benefits as long as the value of non-edible decorations does not exceed 50 percent of the purchase price of the cake.""

Gingrich is partly right when he says that today, ""you don't get food stamps. You get a credit card."" The old system of using coupons is past; recipients now receive what’s called an electronic benefits transfer card, or EBT card. This looks like a credit card, but it doesn’t allow for purchases on credit. It’s really more like a debit card, with the government periodically uploading the proper amount of cash.

In addition to cutting administrative costs, EBT cards allow for easier oversight, and they remove some of the stigma of having to pay with food stamps. In addition, the system can tell at the checkout line which products qualify and which ones don’t. The ones that don’t must be paid for with cash. This amounts to one more way to guard against the possible misuse of funds.

""We have people who take their food stamp money and use it to go to Hawaii.""

If the food stamp system bars beneficiaries from buying decorative gourds rather than pumpkins, you can be sure it also bars the purchase of airline tickets. (Our guess: The benefit amount would be less than the tickets anyway.)

""There is undoubtedly some illegal bartering of EBT cards -- though I understand trafficking in EBT cards is less than under the old food stamps -- but I am having trouble imagining how you could barter an EBT card for an airplane ticket,"" said Julia Isaacs, a child and family policy fellow with the Brookings Institution.

We do at least have a pretty good idea where this notion came from.

In March, the St. Louis television station KMOV did an investigative piece looking at the Missouri food stamp system. It asked the state Department of Social Services for the states where food stamp money was spent.

Current law allows food stamp funds to be spent out of state. This makes sense for recipients who live close to another state, since they may find less expensive groceries across state lines. What the TV station noticed is that some of the expenditures were spent beyond Missouri’s immediate neighbors.

One of the states the report cited was Hawaii. ""In Hawaii, Missouri EBT cardholders spent $2,737 on food in January"" 2011, the station reported.

A couple of immediate points:

First, this was money spent on eligible food items -- not, as Gingrich suggested, on transportation to Hawaii.

Second, the amount was trivial. The total amount spent on food stamps by Missouri that month was $3,884,657, meaning that the amount spent in Hawaii amounted to seven hundredths of 1 percent of the total.

Third, there are two reasons why a food stamp eligible Missouri resident might have good reason to be spending money in Hawaii, and neither involves tropical vacations. One is that the recipient is in the military and was recently transferred to a new duty base. Until new benefits are set up in Hawaii, the servicemember would be able to use the Missouri card for benefits. Alternately, the food stamp user could be a migrant worker who spends part of the year in Missouri but works seasonal jobs in Hawaii.

""They give food stamps now to millionaires.""

Food stamps have always been a means-tested program. Benefits vary by household size -- the full details are here -- but the national rule is that you can’t earn more than 130 percent of the poverty line. That would clearly rule out millionaires.

According to USDA, in 2010, about 43.2 of households on food stamps had gross incomes at 50 percent or less of the poverty line. A full 85 percent had gross incomes below 100 percent of the poverty line. The remaining 15 percent were between 100 percent and 130 percent of poverty, often elderly beneficiaries on fixed incomes.

People above the income ceiling could certainly receive benefits under false pretenses, but doing so would be illegal. Is it possible to be a millionaire and legally receive food stamps? We found one way -- but it’s ridiculously improbable. You’d have to own a million-dollar house but have no other income, and live in a state with sufficiently lenient enforcement to allow it. (Principal residence values, among other assets, are not counted in determining eligibility.)

""I would challenge Newt Gingrich to find a millionaire in annual income who gets on food stamps legally,"" said Michael Wiseman, a public policy professor at George Washington University.

Our ruling

Each of Gingrich’s claims about food stamps is so ridiculous -- especially for a self-styled policy wonk -- that we wondered whether he was really intending to be serious. (By publication time, we did not receive answers to several queries made to his press staff.) But the transcript makes it sound like he wasn’t joking, so we’ll assume he wasn’t. For being so ridiculously wrong in so many ways, we rate his statement Pants on Fire. Update: After we published this item we heard back from USDA spokesman Aaron Lavallee. Lavallee said there was one case in which an unemployed Michigan man who won $2 million in the lottery was deemed eligible for food stamps by the state. He was later removed from the program. Given the isolated nature of the incident and the fact that he was removed from the program, our ruling remains Pants on Fire. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/aa9d6a47-04ea-4af4-b549-7dfc56517ec0",/factchecks/2011/dec/01/newt-gingrich/Gingrich-says-use-food-stamps-Hawaii/

Barack Obama says taxes are lower for middle class today than when he took office
","
During a Nov. 30, 2011, speech in Scranton, Pa., President Barack Obama urged Congress to extend a payroll tax cut. He used the platform to try to change perceptions about his stance on taxes.

""Now, I know you hear a lot of folks on cable TV claiming that I’m this big tax-and-spend liberal,"" Obama said. ""Next time you hear that, you just remind the people who are saying it that since I’ve taken office, I’ve cut your taxes. … The average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office, just remember that. We have cut taxes for small businesses not once, not twice, but 17 times. The average family’s tax burden is among the lowest it’s been in the last 60 years. So the problem is not that we’ve been raising taxes.  We’ve actually been trying to give families a break during these tough times.""

A couple readers asked us to check this item. One wrote us, ""I've seen conservative reactions ranging from, ‘I laughed out loud’ to ‘What a comedian!’""

So we decided to take a look.

We’ve addressed two of these claims in previous items -- the one about small business tax cuts (rating it Mostly True) and the one about the tax burden being the lowest in 60 years (rating it Mostly True). So in this item, we’re only analyzing Obama’s claim that for ""the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office.""

First, let’s recap some background about the tax, and the tax cut, that Obama was touting in Scranton.

The payroll tax refers to federal taxes taken directly from the paychecks of employed Americans. It is primarily used to fund Social Security and Medicare. For two decades, the payroll tax meant a 6.2 percent deduction on annual earnings for most workers. There were limits to the total amount individuals could be required to pay. In 2009 and 2010, the levy applied to the first $106,800 of salary, meaning no one would pay more than $6,621. Employers paid a matching share.

In December 2010, the levy was cut to 4.2 percent for workers as part of an agreement Obama worked out with Congress to extend income tax reductions passed during President George W. Bush’s administration. The payroll tax reduction is in effect for the duration of 2011.
   
But in his American Jobs Act, Obama proposed slicing the payroll to 3.1 percent for workers next year. (To help employers, the president also proposed a 50 percent tax cut in the first $5 million of payroll costs for most small businesses.)

Obama has also enacted some other tax cuts while in office, including the American Opportunity Tax Credit for tuition and other educational fees and expansions of the existing Earned Income Tax Credit and child tax credit.

He’s also raised some taxes (or didn’t stop them from going up), but these hikes aren’t as relevant for judging his statement in Scranton. Some of the tax hikes haven’t taken effect yet, like a few in the health care bill, so these wouldn’t be a factor in judging the statement that for ""the average middle-class family, your taxes today are lower than when I took office."" Other tax increases affect only very wealthy taxpayers.

Two taxes would be relevant for this calculation. Obama signed legislation raising taxes on cigarettes and other tobacco products soon after taking office; that money goes to pay for children's health insurance programs. The law went into effect in 2009. He also signed the health care law, which includes taxes on indoor tanning that went into effect last year.

It’s hard to tell exactly who’s footing the burden for these taxes. However, cigarette and tanning taxes account for a relatively small share of all federal taxes (and zero for people who don’t use either of them).

The broadest analyses we’ve seen are the tax analyses produced by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center, an independent research organization.

We looked at the group’s estimate of what tax burden is borne by Americans of different income levels. The group calculates the average federal tax burden and the average federal tax rate for five quintiles of U.S. households -- or 20-percent groupings, from the top of the income scale to the bottom. These figures include the federal income tax, payroll taxes, and estate taxes, though not federal excise taxes or corporate taxes. (The tax rate figure is the ""effective"" tax rate -- how much the average taxpayer ultimately pays as a percentage of their cash income. It’s not a ""tax bracket,"" which refers to the income tax rate paid on a taxpayer’s final dollar of income.)

To come up with a definition of ""middle class,"" we ignored the top 20 percent and the bottom 20 percent and focused on the three segments of 20 percent each in the middle of the income distribution. We used the tax data for 2008 and for 2011.

So how do the numbers look? Here’s the summary.

Second-lowest 20 percent

2008 tax burden: $1,715
2011 tax burden: $1,396
Decline of $319

2008 tax rate: 6.7 percent
2011 tax rate: 5.7 percent
Decline of 1 percentage point

Middle 20 percent

2008 tax burden: $6,290
2011 tax burden: $5,535
Decline of $775

2008 tax rate: 13.6 percent
2011 tax rate: 12.4 percent
Decline of 1.2 percentage points

Second-highest 20 percent

2008 tax burden: $13,749
2011 tax burden: $13,078
Decline of $671

2008 tax rate: 17.4 percent
2011 tax rate: 16.5 percent
Decline of 0.9 percentage points

So for each of the three middle quintiles, both the amount of tax paid and the effective tax rate paid declined.

Our ruling

Every taxpayer is different, and some ""middle-class"" Americans may have seen their tax rate or their tax burden go up for one reason or another. But Obama was talking about ""the average middle-class family."" The changes to the tax code made under Obama and the analyses by the Tax Policy Center show that for the middle 60 percent of the income distribution, both the average tax paid and the average tax rate fell between 2008 and 2011.

Gov. Rick Scott says 'Obamacare' is 'not the law of the land'
","
Gov. Rick Scott, who has led Florida's opposition to the federal Affordable Care Act, offered justification for refusing millions of dollars in grants to implement the health care law: ""It's not the law of the land.""

His declaration to the Palm Beach Post editorial board on Nov. 17, 2011, prompted the paper to ask experts.

And we wondered: Is that true?

The Affordable Care Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2010, faces review by the U.S. Supreme Court after federal judges offered different opinions about whether some parts of the law violate the U.S. Constitution. That will stretch into next year.

Meanwhile, most states are working to implement the law, which takes effect in stages through January 2015. But not Florida. 
Florida refused grants to roll out the complex 10-part statute when a Florida district court judge ruled it unconstitutional in January 2011, even though the same judge said the law should continue to be implemented as long as his ruling was quickly appealed (which it was).

Scott's administration has turned away grants applied for under Gov. Charlie Crist, such as $2 million for Medicare outreach, $500,000 for an elder affairs counseling and assistance program, $1 million to help consumers monitor health care premiums in the state and $1 million to plan a health care exchange, according to the Governor's Office. Then it turned away larger sums, such as the first installment of more than $30 million to help keep disabled seniors out of nursing homes. Just how much has it turned away? The Governor's Office doesn't keep a tally, spokesman Lane Wright said.

What Scott said

We asked for an audio recording of Scott's discussion with the Palm Beach Post editorial board. Here's how that part of the conversation unfolded:

Randy Schultz, the paper's editorial page editor, noted that Florida had not worked to implement Obama's health care law, then asked: ""Will you implement the law if the Supreme Court upholds all or part of it?""

Scott replied: ""If it's the law of the land, we'll be ready.""

Post editorial writer Rhonda Swan commented that the state has rejected millions in federal grants designed to help the state prepare. So, she asked, how would the governor pay for implementation?

""It's my job, if it's the law of the country, to be ready when it's the law,"" Scott said. ""... When it's the law of the land, we'll implement the law.""

""Where will you find the money?"" Swan asked.

""It'll be part of our budget,"" Scott said.

Swan continued to press, finally asking: ""Why not take the money that the federal government is offering now so you can be prepared?""

""Because it's not the law of the land,"" Scott said. ""I don't believe it'll ever become the law of the land.""

Legal views 
While some judges have found the law to be unconstitutional, none has told states to stop implementing it. 
""This is the law -- it's been passed by both houses of Congress and signed by the president,"" Jost said. 
That's also the position of the U.S. Department of Heath and Human Services.  
""Legal challenges are nothing new, but they don't change the status of a law,"" said spokeswoman Erin Shields. 
So, what did the governor mean?

Spokesman Lane Wright said that beyond constitutional questions about the health care law, its most significant and expensive provisions don't take effect until 2014. Those include an expansion of Medicaid, the mandate that individuals purchase health insurance and a requirement for states to set up health insurance exchanges to make coverage available to people who don't get it through their employers.

""None of those are in effect right now and, hence, are not the law of the land,"" Wright said.

Of course, many provisions of the law are in effect. There's already a 50 percent discount for name-brand drugs in the Medicare ""doughnut hole."" Young adults can get insurance coverage through their parents. Insurance companies can't go back and search for a technical error on an application to deny payment for services once someone gets sick. Small businesses qualify for tax credits to help them provide health benefits to workers. New insurance plans must offer free preventive care. That's just a partial list of elements of the law in effect last year.

Meanwhile, does the governor really mean to argue that he's turning away money to prepare for provisions of the law to go into effect because they haven't yet gone into effect?

Randy Barnett, a Georgetown law professor involved in the Supreme Court challenge to the health care law, offered another interpretation of Scott's statement.

The governor took an oath to support the Constitution. So he might take the stance that the law, ""though properly enacted, is contrary to the Constitution and therefore not a valid and binding law,"" Barnett said.

So Jost -- a law professor who considers the health care law constitutional -- finds Scott's statement ""ridiculous."" But Barnett -- who considers it unconstitutional -- suggests Scott has a point.

Does one represent the settled legal view?

We asked Laurence Tribe, a Harvard law professor who has argued 35 cases before the U.S. Supreme Court. (He's also publicly debated the constitutionality of the health care law and worked as an adviser to the Justice Department at the time the law passed.) 
""Of course the Affordable Care Act is the 'law of the land,' "" he said. ""It is completely settled that, although public officials and citizens generally are entitled to have and to express their own opinions that a duly enacted federal statute like the Affordable Care Act violates the Constitution, unless and until the United States Supreme Court upholds that view, the rule of law requires that the Affordable Care Act be enforced unless repealed. ...

""We would not have a functioning system of government if officials could take the law into their own hands whenever they held the view that Congress had exceeded its authority.""

Our ruling

Scott said he's refusing federal grant money to implement the Affordable Care Act in Florida ""because it's not the law of the land.""",/factchecks/2011/dec/01/rick-scott/gov-rick-scott-says-obamacare-not-law-land/

Conservative group says signers of petitions to recall Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker are at risk
","Two days after the launch of a campaign to recall Republican Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker from office, a conservative group claimed it uncovered dangers in the signature gathering process.

The warning was made in a Nov. 17, 2011 online article by Media Trackers, a suburban Milwaukee nonprofit that calls itself a conservative ""watchdog dedicated to promoting accountability in the media and government across Wisconsin.""

The group is funded by American Majority, a Virginia-based organization founded by a tea party leader.

Due to ""a flaw in the security of the system (that) has been discovered,"" Media Trackers said in the article, ""there are no privacy protections for those who sign a recall petition.""

The group also stated that people who circulate petitions don’t have to be credentialed, saying ""someone could use the guise of the recall to gather information from complete strangers and then, with no intention of actually turning the petitions in, use that data to stalk individuals with the intent of carrying out a crime.""

So, Media Trackers is making two claims it says are newly discovered and pose a threat to recall petition signers:

1. People circulating recall petitions don’t have to be certified by a government agency and don’t have to register with the state.

2. People signing the petitions have ""no privacy protections.""

There has been considerable confusion about the recall petition process. We recently rated a statement from Republican state Treasurer Kurt Schuller that recall petitions must be signed in the presence of another person as False. (State law says you can act as both the witness and the signer.)

And there are other process-related statements we’re working on.

What about the Media Trackers claims?

Petition circulation

Media Trackers communications director Brian Sikma, who wrote the article, acknowledged it has always been the case that people who gather signatures on recall petitions -- like those who circulate nomination papers for candidates -- don’t need certification and don’t need to register with the state.

Sikma argued the non-credentialing is a newly discovered phenomenon because recalls are rare and this provision came to light only after recall elections were held for nine Wisconsin state senators in summer 2011.

But that amounts to spin on Media Trackers’ part; the fact is, nothing in the law regarding people who circulate recall petitions has changed.

Sikma said no credentialing makes it easy for people with motives other than recalling the governor -- such as committing a crime -- to circulate petitions. He argued that citizens don’t face the same risk when they are approached by people who are doing voter registration because they must be certified by local government officials. Similarly, he said, signers of a candidate’s nomination papers can generally be assured that people gathering those signatures are monitored by the candidate’s campaign.

Reid Magney, spokesman for the Wisconsin Government Accountability Board, which oversees elections and the recall process, said the fact that a person need only be qualified to vote in Wisconsin to circulate recall petitions is crucial.
  
The U.S. Constitution guarantees citizens the right to redress government for grievances and the Wisconsin constitution grants them the right to bring a recall election, Magney said.

""We don’t make people get certified to write letters to the editor. We don’t make them register with someone before they make and carry a sign,"" he said. ""This is basic public involvement.""

So, despite Media Trackers’ claim, it’s not new that state law does not require credentialing of people who circulate recall petitions. And while it’s possible recall petition signers could be targeted for crime, Media Trackers provided nothing more than conjecture to back up that statement.

Petition signers

Media Trackers points out that the information signers put on the recall petitions -- their name, signature and the date they signed -- is open to the public with ""no privacy protections.""

Again, Sikma acknowledged this is not a new provision, other than in the sense that until 2011 recalls had been rare in the state.

(Prior to the 2011 Senate recalls, in which two incumbents were removed from office, only four Wisconsin state lawmakers had ever been recalled, two successfully. In the U.S., only two governors have been successfully recalled.)

Sikma argued that passions run high in recall elections and signers are more vulnerable in that, by signing a recall petition, they are indicating a ""political preference."" That means recall opponents could target recall petition signers for mailings or perhaps harassment, Sikma said.

During the run-up to the 2011 Senate recalls, we rated as True a claim by Republican Kim Simac that people who signed petitions to recall state Sen. Jim Holperin, D-Conover, received phone calls they considered harassing from out-of-state telemarketers insinuating foul play by circulators.

But passions can run high in regular elections, too, and a person who signs a candidate’s nomination papers is also indicating a political preference.

Magney said that making the petition signer’s name, signature and address a public record is vital to an open process -- all citizens have the opportunity to review the signatures to determine whether enough valid signatures have been collected to hold a recall election.

In the 2011 Senate recalls, the Government Accountability Board scanned all recall petitions and posted them on its website. The board plans to do the same if recall petitions are filed against Walker.

So, the group is also misleading when it says it is newly discovered that there are ""no privacy protections"" for the limited information recall signers provide. There never have been.

Our conclusion

Media Trackers said recall petition signers are vulnerable to crime or harassment because of two newly discovered provisions in Wisconsin’s recall process.

Neither provision is new, so it’s misleading to call them newly discovered. As for the risk to petition signers, Media Trackers provided no evidence that they have been victims of crime, although some have received phone calls from out-of-state telemarketers in the past.

We rate Media Trackers’ statement Mostly False. ",/factchecks/2011/dec/01/media-trackers/conservative-group-media-trackers-says-wisconsin-r/
