SEIU, District 1199, says there’s “no clinical evidence that vaccinating healthcare workers protects patients.”
","
The Rhode Island Department of Health and a union representing health-care workers in hospitals and nursing homes recently set aside their court dispute over state regulations requiring that the workers get flu immunizations.

The Department of Health required health-care workers to get immunized or, if they refused, to wear surgical masks when having contact with patients, in an effort to help reduce the spread of flu to patients. The SEIU Healthcare Employees Union, District 1199, in a suit filed in December, argued that the regulations violated due-process and collective-bargaining rights.

The union withdrew its suit as the flu season was winding down, saying it hoped to reach a compromise with the health department.

A March 5 Providence Journal story on the dispute prompted us to look at the union’s complaint, where we found this claim: ""There is no clinical evidence that vaccinating healthcare workers protects patients.""

The debate over whether to mandate vaccinations for employees has been going on nationally for years. The federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated, from a survey it did, that across the health-care worker population, including doctors, nurses and others,  66.9 percent of workers were vaccinated for the 2011-12 flu season.

Several national health agencies, including the CDC and the American Medical Association, strongly recommend that all health-care employees get vaccinated.

We wondered whether there really was no evidence that vaccinating health-care workers protects patients.

We quickly found several relevant, peer-reviewed studies that indicated otherwise, though their findings were not uniformly the same and methodologies differed.

One was done by researchers at the Institute of Virology at the University of Glasgow and published in 2000 in The Lancet, one of the most respected medical journals in the world.

The study, which looked at health-care workers in 20 long-term elderly care hospitals in Scotland, concluded that vaccinations of health-care workers ""was associated with a substantial decrease in"" death among patients but that surveillance of those involved in the study ""showed no associated decrease in non-fatal influenza infection in patients.""

Another study, published in BMJ, formerly known as the British Medical Journal, was conducted at a chain of nursing homes in England. It said it found decreases both in deaths of nursing home residents and in ""influenza-like illness"" when more workers were vaccinated during the winter of 2003-04.

And a study published in the journal Vaccine in 2009 used computer modeling to simulate a flu outbreak. Its authors, four researchers from the Netherlands, said their model showed that health-care employee vaccinations reduce flu transmission.

We contacted the union to ask for data supporting its position and ultimately heard by e-mail from Bill Borwegen, the occupational health and safety national director for the SEIU in Washington, D.C.

""From a common sense standpoint, it would certainly seem to be a ""no-brainer,"" Borwegen said of vaccinating health-care workers to prevent flu transmission to patients. ""However there have been three systematic reviews of all of the epidemiological evidence ... and they have all concluded remarkably that there is no clinically proven connection.""

Borwegen added that ""of course we all should strongly promote voluntary flu vaccination for self-protection, but we also need to understand the limitations of the current vaccine.""

He sent us links to three studies. One largely focused on the effectiveness of the vaccine generally and not on health-care workers.

But the other two were more relevant to the union’s claim.

The most on point was a review published in 2010 by the Cochrane Collaboration, an organization of international experts that reviews medical research.

The Collaboration reviewed studies of whether vaccinating health-care workers protects elderly patients, including those that PolitiFact Rhode Island had reviewed.

Its review cited problems or inconsistencies with the studies and concluded that vaccinating health-care workers who care for the elderly ""did not show any effect on the specific outcomes of interest, namely laboratory proven inﬂuenza,  pneumonia or deaths from pneumonia"" among the patients. However, it said vaccinations did have an effect on influenza-like illnesses, hospital admissions and ""overall mortality of the elderly.""

The third study referenced the Cochrane findings and said there was a ""paucity of evidence"" to support mandatory vaccinations.

But one of the three authors of the Cochrane review -- Dr. Roger Thomas of the University of Calgary -- was quoted in the New York Times ""Well"" blog as saying:  ""Not having evidence doesn’t prove it doesn’t work; we just don’t know.""

It’s also worth noting that there is debate over the effectiveness of current flu vaccines. For example, an October 2012 study by the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy, at the University of Minnesota, asserted that coming up with more effective flu vaccine should be a priority.

Our ruling

SEIU Healthcare Employees Union, District 1199, said in its lawsuit that ""there is no clinical evidence that vaccinating healthcare workers protects patients.""

That’s an unequivocal statement. But in fact, researchers found such evidence and published their findings in peer-reviewed studies in respected medical journals.

The fact that other researchers disputed the evidence doesn’t mean the evidence doesn’t exist. We’ll leave it to the scientists to fight over how conclusive the evidence is.

But our judges rule this claim False.

"['Oregon', 'Children', 'Health Care', 'Government Regulation', 'Public Health', 'Joseph Levy']","
Are indoor workers more likely to get melanoma, despite lower UV than outdoor workers?
","Oregon lawmakers are pondering a bill that would prohibit teenagers from hopping into professional tanning beds, unless they have an order from a doctor saying it’s OK. House Bill 2896, which cleared the Oregon House, has bipartisan support and the staunch backing of public health and cancer specialists, who say that teen tanners are at high risk of developing melanoma. They spoke passionately at a recent legislative hearing.

Also at the hearing was Joseph Levy, executive director of International Smart Tan Network. And he wasn’t having any of that anti-tanning bed testimony. He mounted a spirited defense of his industry, denying that there is a ""straightforward relationship"" between melanoma and ultraviolet light.

""That would be impossible. Indoor workers get 3 to 9 times less UV than outdoor workers, but they get more melanomas. The proponents of the bill have not acknowledged that very important caveat. It is not disputed. The World Health Organization recognizes it,"" he said.

PolitiFact Oregon wanted to know if indoor workers have higher rates of melanoma than outdoor workers, who are exposed every working day to UV light from the sun. And if so, does that necessarily upend the link between exposure and cancer? Because that is how Levy was using the statistic -- to make the larger point that more UV does not necessarily mean more cancer, so there’s no need to keep teens from tanning beds. UV and cancer UV is indisputably a carcinogen, like alcohol and tobacco. Exposure doesn’t necessarily lead to skin cancer, but the chances go up. Medical experts say there are lots of factors that determine who develops cancer, including genetics. Freckled fair-skinned redheads with many moles, for example, are at greater risk than olive-complected people without moles.

Still, leading health organizations all agree that people should limit exposure to the sun: Wear a hat, apply sunscreen, cover up limbs. Tanning beds have UV rays, just like sunshine.  

Is Levy right about melanoma rates being higher among indoor workers over outdoor workers? He sent over two documents, one an abstract of a 1990 study of sunlight exposure and melanoma in the U.S. Navy. The other is a one-page fact sheet from the Smart Tan Educational Institute, quoting the World Health Organization and listing a number of study citations. Neither provided enough clarity for PolitiFact Oregon.

With the help of the Internet, we found a 2011 research article by Dianne E. Godar, a chemist with the Food and Drug Administration. In the introduction, she writes that ""although outdoor workers get three to 10 times the annual UV dose that indoor workers get, they have similar or lower incidences of cutaneous malignant melanoma."" CMM, as it’s called, is a dangerous form of melanoma that can spread if not treated.

The author gives three reasons for why this might be: One, people who work indoors are exposed to high concentrations of sunlight on holiday or on weekends, resulting in sunburns that may lay the groundwork for skin cancer. Two, these people work inside offices where they receive sunlight filtered through windows. The windows allow in gene-mutating UVA wavelengths, which promote cancer development, but block out Vitamin D-making UVB, which ward off tumor development. Who knew?

The World Health Organization shares that line of reasoning: ""Tumour development may be linked to occasional exposure to short periods of intense sunlight, such as at weekends or on holiday. The higher incidence of malignant melanoma in indoor workers compared to outdoor workers supports that notion.""

So, it’s not that indoor workers are avoiding the sun; it’s that they’re getting the wrong kind of sun in the worst possible way. We reached out to Godar but were not able to communicate with her directly. An FDA spokeswoman provided a statement, which reads in part: ""Melanoma incidence has consistently been associated with intense, intermittent sun exposure as opposed to chronic sun exposure such as that received by some outdoor workers.""

We also reached out to Joseph Levy, to let him know that it’s not just a matter of indoor workers receiving less light. We reminded him that the WHO quote -- which his group uses -- suggests a link between tumors and exposure to shorter rounds of intense sunlight. He suggested PolitiFact Oregon did not understand what he was saying.

""The NATURE of the relationship between UV and melanoma is not understood. There are theories (such as the theory that sunburn or perhaps intermittent exposures may be the issue) but they are just that: theories,"" he wrote.

So he’s OK with the numbers, but not OK with the theories.

We also checked with Dr. Brian Druker, director of the Knight Cancer Institute at Oregon Health & Science University. Druker agrees with Levy that this is a complex issue and that genetics play a role. But Druker says the ""weight of the medical evidence"" is clear: Exposure to sun increases the risk of skin cancer. As for Levy’s use of the indoor workers statistic? ""That was a complete distortion of why that risk was higher,"" Druker said. The ruling:  
Levy is using the finding -- that indoor workers have higher rates of melanoma than outdoor workers -- to try to derail legislation that would make tanning beds off-limits to teenagers, who have more susceptible skin.

His statement contains an element of truth, but ignores critical facts. The theory for the element of truth is that indoor workers have higher rates of melanoma than outdoor workers because of the way they are exposed to sun, and to types of sun rays. We find that’s information that would make readers think twice about tanning beds as benign. We rate the statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/mar/16/joseph-levy/are-indoor-workers-more-likely-get-melanoma-despit/
"['Rhode Island', 'Health Care', 'Joshua Miller']","
Rhode Island Sen. Joshua Miller says state’s total medical spending fell 18 percent from 2007 to 2011
","
In a March 1 news release, Sen. Joshua Miller, D-Cranston, announced a ""landmark bill"" representing the ""next phase of health-care reform legislation in Rhode Island.""

Miller, chairman of the Senate Committee on Health and Human Services, said his bill builds on previous legislative work, including the creation of the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner in 2004, electronic records and payment reforms.

""These efforts have begun to show significant progress in cost containment,"" Miller said in a news release. ""In the period from 2007 to 2011, the Office of the Health Insurance Commissioner reported an 18 percent decline in the state’s total medical spending and an increase by insurers of 8 percent in medical claims dollars spent on primary care, up from 5.4 percent in 2007.""

Given all you hear about the rising cost of health care, PolitiFact Rhode Island was curious about the claim that Rhode Island’s total medical spending fell by 18 percent in that time frame.

When we asked Miller to back up his claim, he cited a September 2012 report from the state health insurance commissioner’s office regarding attempts to bolster spending on primary care in Rhode Island.

""Between 2007 and 2011, total primary care spending grew by 23 percent (for an annual growth rate of 5.3 percent), while overall medical spending fell by 17.6 percent (-4.7 percent annually),"" the report said.

The report noted that the figures reflected the money spent by insurers, not by patients. And it attributed the overall decline in medical spending to three factors:
  

In an interview, Health Commissioner Christopher F. Koller said, ""Senator Miller is factually accurate in that the numbers are from the report, and the total medical spending reported by insurers during that period is true.""

But then Koller mentioned two key facts: total medical spending is down in large part because it reflects health insurer spending for fewer people. The most recent figures show per-person costs are actually rising.

""It’s during a period of economic decline, so more people are uninsured,"" Koller said. ""Also, during that time, we saw an increase in the number of companies that self-insure."" And the figures don’t reflect those covered by employers who self-insure, such as Brown University, he said.

Between 2007 and 2011, commercial health-insurance enrollment in Rhode Island plunged by 53,509 people or by 8.7 percent -- going from 613,124 to 559,615, according to Koller’s office.

And when measured per-member per-month, medical spending rose by 6.8 percent between 2009 and 2011, according to another report by his office.

Koller said that 6.8 increase is ""relatively low"" when compared with the increases seen in other states in that time frame. So, he said, that bolsters Miller’s larger point that Rhode Island is doing a good job of controlling health-care cost increases.

Our ruling

Sen. Joshua Miller said, ""In the period from 2007 to 2011, the Office of Health Insurance Commissioner reported an 18 percent decline in the state’s total medical spending.""

In touting Rhode Island’s progress in ""cost containment,"" Miller’s accurate but limited citation of a report gives the impression that overall medical costs are falling in Rhode Island.

But his news release left out some important context: that spending by insurers has fallen mainly because it reflected spending on fewer people. In fact, in recent years, per-person costs have increased.

That full context is required to provide a true picture of how Rhode Island is doing in controlling health-care costs.

So we rule Miller’s claim Half True.

"['Rhode Island', 'Elections', 'Robert Kando']","
Head of R.I. Elections Board says state is the last using “Optech III P” voting machines and they don’t meet federal standards
","
Robert Kando, executive director of the Rhode Island Board of Elections, appeared before the House Oversight Committee earlier this month as it continued its inquiry into what caused long lines at some polling places during the November general election.

Among suggestions Kando made to ease problems in the future was replacing the machines Rhode Island uses at its voting precincts to count ballots. The optical scanners  -- known by their trade name, the Optech III P Eagle -- were purchased in 1997.

In fact, said Kando, Rhode Island is the last state still using them and they don’t meet the suggested standards set by the federal Help America Vote Act, known as HAVA.

Kando’s comments, implying that our voting machines are deficient, caught our attention.

When we contacted Kando he was adamant that Rhode Island is the last state still using the Optech III P Eagles. But he was less sure what exactly made our voting machines non-compliant with some new -- and the important word here is ""voluntary"" -- federal guidelines for voting machines.

""You would have to be an engineer to figure that out,"" he replied. Kando said he would contact the company that maintained Rhode Island’s machines -- Election Systems and Software (ES&S), based in Nebraska -- and get back to us with the reasons.

In the meantime, we did some research.

Congress passed the Help America Vote Act in 2002 in response to the ""hanging chad"" debacle of the 2000 presidential election. In that contest between George W. Bush and Al Gore, confusion with reading paper ballots in Florida and deciphering voters’ intent eventually led to the U.S. Supreme Court intervening and stopping the recount, putting Bush in the White House.

HAVA provided money to states to upgrade their voting systems to assure a higher level of accuracy, a better recount system and improved access for voters with disabilities.

The act also created a new federal agency called the Elections Assistance Commission to advise states on how to comply with HAVA. The commission wrote up some technical guidelines for voting machines -- dealing with among other things software and electrical capabilities -- but made these guidelines voluntary.

States could use the Voluntary Voting System Guidelines if they wanted to have the EAC certify that their voting machines met HAVA requirements. But states such as Rhode Island, which used machines purchased before the 2002 HAVA requirements, weren’t required to do so.

We found through various sources, including verifiedvoting.org, that more than 200 counties and communities in at least at least seven other states -- Alabama, Idaho, Indiana, Massachusetts, Maine, Wisconsin and Virginia -- were still using Optech III P Eagle voting machines. (Unlike Rhode Island, most states don’t use the same machine statewide.)

We also checked in with Rhode Island’s Secretary of State A. Ralph Mollis on whether our voting machines meet the voluntary standards.

Spokesman Chris Barnett wouldn’t answer that question directly, but issued a general statement: ""We agree that Rhode Island’s voting machines are beyond their useful life,"" and he said his office hoped the machines would be replaced before the next election in 2014.

Finally Kando forwarded to us an e-mail he had received from ES&S which cited three specific areas in which Rhode Island’s voting machines were ""non-compliant"" with the voluntary standards. And we quote:

""No operating system -- all OS type functions included in the assembler firmware""

""No life cycle counter""

""No poll open process - power on allows ballots to be read.""

When we asked Kando to explain, noting that legislators would likely need something in English if they were to approve spending $5 million to replace the machines, Kando replied:

""While I have my own understanding of the three deficiencies . . . I am fearful that any answer that I provide will be dissected to uncover any flaw and that the best source of information is the vendor.""

In a phone interview, Kathy A. Rogers, vice president of government affairs with ES&S, explained the three deficiencies.

""No operating system . . . "" pertains to the machine’s aging hardware and software no longer being capable of tabulating votes at the speed and efficiency the suggested standards recommend.

""No life cycle counter"" means  that Rhode Island’s machines, unlike newer models, can’t keep a running count of how many votes were counted through them in their lifetimes.

And finally ""no poll open process"" concerns turning the machines on. For security reasons, the standards require that voting machines have a password or a lock system in order to turn them on. The Optech Eagles, however, ""were designed to begin counting ballots as soon as you plugged it in,"" said Rogers

In a follow up interview, Kando said the point he was trying to make with his statement is that Rhode Island’s voting machines are substandard, not obsolete. They still assure ""an accurate and fair"" tabulation of votes, he said.

And ES&S did say in an e-mail to Kando that while the machines don’t comply with some new standards, they are ""performing accurately, reliably and securely if used and maintained according to recommendations.""

Our ruling

Robert Kando said that Rhode Island is the only state still using the Optech III P Eagle voting machine, and that the machines do not meet suggested federal standards.

He’s wrong on the first count: a quick search found at least seven other states still using the old machines.

He’s right on the second: the vendor confirmed to us that the machines aren’t compliant with some voluntary federal standards.

We rule his statement Half True.

"['National', 'Federal Budget', 'Paul Ryan']","
Paul Ryan says nation’s debt is bigger than the economy
","
Paul Ryan told a boisterous CPAC crowd that without action on the budget, ""the debt will weigh down our country like an anchor.""

Ryan, the Wisconsin congressman and former Republican vice presidential candidate, rose to prominence for budget proposals that dramatically cut spending and made structural changes to Medicare to achieve more savings. This week, Ryan released the 2014 version, which follows much the same blueprint -- and makes the same dire warnings about the nation’s debt.

""Our debt is already bigger than our economy,"" he said at CPAC on March 15, 2013.

Our colleagues at PolitiFact Texas checked out a similar claim from Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas. Here, we’ll take a fresh look.

GDP vs. which kind of debt?

Ryan’s office pointed us to two sources of government figures. First, the easy one.

The Bureau of Economic Analysis’ put out a press release on February 28, 2013 putting GDP at just over $15.8 trillion. The government defines the GDP -- gross domestic product -- as the market value of the goods and services produced by labor and property within the country.

As for the debt, the U.S. Treasury is the go-to source. As of March 14, 2013, total outstanding public debt is $16,708,225,460,175.14. (We’ll call it $16.7 trillion for everyone’s sanity.) That’s broken down into two categories: debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings.

Here are those dollar figures:

Debt held by the public: $11.9 trillion

Intragovernmental holdings: $4.8 trillion

To explain the difference, we’ll borrow from our PolitiFact Texas colleagues’ handiwork.

Intragovernmental debt refers to money owed by agencies within government to other agencies -- basically an internal accounting issue. An example: Social Security surpluses that the government uses for other federal operations. Such money will have to be repaid, it’s presumed, but the demand is less pressing right now and it doesn’t affect credit markets.
   
In contrast, public debt reflects money borrowed from outside sources -- giving it more of a connection to the economy, Josh Gordon, an analyst with the anti-deficit Concord Coalition, told PolitiFact Texas. ""If your problem with the national debt is that you think it’s affecting the economy or interest rates or something like that, the only part of the national debt that affects the economy is the debt held by the public. That’s where the (U.S.) Treasury is borrowing money on the open market.""

Paul Van de Water, an economist with the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, further explained why that matters.

""Debt held by the public is important because it reflects the extent to which the government goes
into private credit markets to borrow. Such borrowing draws on private national saving and
international saving and therefore competes with investment in the nongovernmental sector (for
factories and equipment, research and development, housing, and so forth). Large increases in such borrowing can also push up interest rates and increase the future interest payments the federal government must make to foreign lenders, which reduces Americans’ income. Achieving a stable debt-to-GDP ratio is a key test of fiscal sustainability,"" Van de Water wrote in a memo.

So, if we just consider debt held by the public -- which is what most affects the economy -- it totals about 75 percent of GDP -- not, as Ryan said, more than the size of the economy.

But Ryan isn’t entirely off-base, especially since partisans tend to disagree about the importance of intragovernmental holdings.

""When you dig a bit deeper, you hit a partisan debate about the portion of the debt not held by the public, most of which is held by the government in trust funds. Republicans say that the trust funds are filled with IOUs, which eventually will have to be redeemed with other funds. Democrats say that the trust funds represent binding promises that government has made to tens of millions of Americans. They’re both right,"" said William Galston, an expert with the Brookings Institution who was an adviser to President Bill Clinton. ""What Ryan said is not untrue, although it’s not the only way of describing the truth.""

Our ruling

Ryan claimed that ""our debt is already bigger than our economy.""

If you count debt held by the public and intragovernmental holdings, the debt is roughly 105 percent of the economy. But counting only debt held by the public, which is what many economists say affects the wider economy and credit markets, the debt is only 75 percent of  GDP.

Debt held by the public is more relevant to discussions about federal spending, but it’s not the one Ryan cited. We rate his statement Half True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/15/paul-ryan/paul-ryan-says-nations-debt-bigger-economy/
"['China', 'Technology', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says Chinese government provides ""no access to the Internet""
","
U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., painted a dire portrait of China in his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference, saying the country is ""trying to supplant us as the leading power in the world.""

""Let me explain to you who the Chinese government is. The Chinese government provides their people no access to the Internet,"" Rubio said on March 14. ""The Chinese government will hold citizens prisoner without any right to recourse. The Chinese government coerces and tortures people until they get confessions from them.""

He gave a few more examples of Chinese coercion before asking, ""We want that to be the leading country in the world?"" The crowd shouted ""No!""

We wondered if Rubio was right about the Chinese government preventing its citizens from accessing the Internet.

It’s not.

By a wide margin, China leads the world in the sheer number of citizens accessing the Internet, with 538 million estimated users as of June 2012, according to Internet World Stats, which tracks Web use across the globe. The United States ranks second with about 245 million. About 40 percent of China’s population uses the Internet, placing it far below the penetration of many countries, including the U.S. at 78 percent. The major Internet providers in China are government-run telecom companies.

Rubio would have been on more solid ground if he said the Chinese government censors the Internet.

Although people in China can access the Internet through home computers, Internet cafes and smartphones, they face some censorship, said Adam Segal, a fellow who specializes in technology and development in China at the Council on Foreign Relations, in an email. Access to a number of American and foreign websites is blocked or filtered, such as Twitter, YouTube and Facebook, but there are some Chinese equivalents.

""There can be very open discussion on Sina Weibo, which is a Twitter-like service,"" Segal said, ""though they are then censored if they become too sensitive.""

The government blocked access to the New York Times and Bloomberg for reporting on the wealth of the family of prime minister Wen Jiabao. And after the 18th Communist Party Congress got its start in November 2012, all Google programs, including Gmail and its search engine, could not be accessed in the country.

In June 2012, Google unveiled on its Hong Kong-based search site a mechanism that identifies political and sensitive terms that may break the connection to Google, the Wall Street Journal reported. For example: the government has blocked the Chinese word for ""carrot"" which contains the character for Chinese President Hu Jintao’s surname.

The names of top leaders, dissidents and references to the June 4, 1989, Tiananmen Square protests can also be blocked. To avoid that censorship, some people in China have referred to the date of the protests as ""May 35th.""

According to the Times, all Internet traffic in China must pass through one of three computer centers in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, where computers known as the Great Firewall of China compare data with an updated list of keywords and Web address that are forbidden.

Some Chinese users try to get around the firewall and access forbidden sites through virtual private networks or VPNs that essentially allow users to ""tunnel"" out of the country to avoid the censors, but China also cracked down on those services, which its Communist-affiliated daily newspaper called illegal.

Two years ago, the Beijing government clamped down on rules for microblogging, requiring users to register on sites like Sina Weibo with their real names, a move preventing anonymous commentary and criticism about the government and news events, according to the Wall Street Journal. In December 2012, the country’s congress adopted similar rules requiring Internet users to give their full names to service providers (while keeping pseudonyms on microblog posts) and Internet companies to report forbidden postings to the government, according to the Times.

""China has the world's most robust controls, both technical and human, on the Internet,"" David Bandurski, editor of the University of Hong Kong's China Media Project website, said in an email to PolitiFact. ""But this is by no means the full picture. Internet use is growing rapidly in the country, which currently has more than 570 million Internet users, 75 percent of which access the Internet on mobile devices.""

While many non-Chinese social media are blocked, homegrown versions are active allowing Chinese to even criticize authorities.

""It is a messy picture, and Chinese leaders are constantly struggling to balance control, which is still a major priority, with the growing public demand for information,"" Bandurski said.

Scott Edwards, an Amnesty International senior staffer based in Washington, D.C., said Rubio’s statement is up to a little bit of interpretation. Yes, the Chinese can access the Internet. But the government does not ""provide"" -- that’s the word Rubio used -- free and unfettered access. Plus, there is the undeniably wide divide in the country of access between the rich and poor. Internet use is also sometimes monitored, Edwards said.

Rubio’s comment touches on the debate of the free Internet movement, Edwards said, which calls on the government to provide access to the Internet and that the government should not be interfering. In a policy that was even backed by China, the United Nations Human Rights Council affirmed that freedom of expression online is a basic human right.

We emailed Rubio’s press team for comment and did not hear back.

Our ruling

In describing a litany of offenses by China’s Communist government, Rubio said, ""The Chinese government provides their people no access to the Internet.""

This is not true. The Chinese can access the Internet, and they do it in numbers higher than any other country.

However, the government blocks many popular Internet sites and censors content, limiting the access for Chinese people.

Rand Paul mocks federally funded study on menus for astronauts
","
A Hawaii research project to choose cuisine for astronauts? Count us in!

During a speech to the conservative CPAC conference, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., made fun of a number of scientific research projects funded by the federal government, suggesting that they were a waste of taxpayer money. Here’s one of them:

""For any of you college students looking for jobs, Uncle Sam’s got a job for you,"" said Paul during the March 14, 2013, speech. ""The pay’s $5,000, all expenses paid. The study is in Hawaii. But the requirements are onerous. Only a few can qualify. You have to like food. The study is to develop a menu for when we colonize Mars. I’m not making this up. Guess what a bunch of college students came up with for the menu. Pizza!""

Battling 'menu fatigue'

The name of the study blends science fiction with tropical breezes: ""Hawaii Space Exploration Analogue and Simulation,"" or HI-SEAS. Most of it does take place in Hawaii, under the guidance of scientists from Cornell University and the University of Hawaii at Manoa using a $947,000 grant from NASA. Six primary participants and two alternates have been chosen to spend 120 days in ""space"" (actually a barren lava field) to simulate the conditions faced by astronauts on a mission to Mars.

Since cooking is considered nearly impossible while rocketing through space, astronauts have long eaten prepackaged, ready-to-consume foods. (Remember Tang?) But on a mission to Mars, astronauts would be at greater risk for what scientists call ""menu fatigue"" -- becoming so bored with the same meals that they don't eat enough to keep their muscles, bone and organs healthy enough. (And we know that space travelers need their strength so they can maneuver an X-Wing to blow up the Death Star.)

There could be better menu options once they land on Mars, however, because the planet’s gravity might allow them to cook. The purpose of the Hawaii study is to determine whether the benefits of having astronauts cook meals outweigh the additional cost, complexity and crew time involved in cooking.

To do this, the crew in Hawaii will live in a 950-square-foot structure in the middle of a lava field, 8,200 feet above sea level on the slope of the Hawaiian volcano Mauna Loa. ""There is no vegetation visible for miles, nor can the crew see the ocean,"" Kim Binstead, a University of Hawaii- Manoa astrobiologist who is helping run the study, told PolitiFact. ""The temperature routinely goes below 40 degrees Fahrenheit."" (Check out the 360-degree view of what the crew will see every day -- it really does look a lot like Mars.)

Study participants can only leave their capsule when wearing a modified HAZMAT suit that simulates a spacesuit. ""This is not a vacation, and life at the habitat will be crowded, uncomfortable and busy,"" she said.

The crew will conduct a variety of monitoring experiments on each other, as well as other scientific studies. For instance, they will measure their fellow participants’ ability to smell, their food and nutrient intake and their changes in mood, health and body mass.

Contrary to Paul’s tongue-in-cheek suggestion, college couch potatoes wouldn’t have had a very good shot at getting selected. The crew was chosen from among 700 applicants according to NASA astronaut selection criteria. ""Four are scientists with Ph.Ds, one is a science journalist, and one is wrapping up an M.S. in robotics,"" Binstead said. ""This last crewmember, our one student, is also an Afghanistan veteran who built a bomb-sniffing robot from spare parts while deployed. Three of our crew members applied to be NASA astronauts this year, and all made it into the ‘highly qualified’ group.""

Considering the crew members’ qualifications, $5,000 for four months’ work in tight quarters, plus two preparatory training sessions, doesn’t exactly sound lavish. The stipend doesn’t even come with health insurance.

How accurate is Paul’s description?

Even though he was playing the study for laughs, Paul does describe some aspects correctly. The project is supported by federal funding, the pay for participants is $5,000, expenses are covered, and the longest portion of the study takes place in Hawaii.

Even so, we think Paul was off-base when he said its goal is to ""develop a menu for when we colonize Mars.""

""We're not developing menus -- we're comparing food systems,"" Binstead said. ""The lessons we learn are applicable to all long-duration space missions, as well as to military deployments and other isolated, hazardous activities here on Earth."" She added that ""no one is talking about 'colonizing' Mars."" Any human visit to Mars currently being envisioned would be temporary.

We asked a space expert whether he thought the study was frivolous. He said he didn’t think it was.

""This is one of many Mars analog activities supported by NASA,"" said Edward Ellegood, a space policy analyst at Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University. ""I might object to a bunch of NASA civil servants devoting all their time to this, but enlisting universities and students makes it both educational and scientifically useful, while also building a cadre of experts who might support a real Mars mission when we end up doing one.""

Ellegood said he thought it ironic that ""on one hand, NASA is being pressured by Congress and the public to focus on long-duration human exploration missions, and on the other hand they're being ridiculed for conducting some of the research that is prerequisite to such missions.""

Our ruling

Paul gets the basics of the project right. The government is paying for a study in Hawaii in which people will prepare foods under conditions that simulate a mission to Mars. 
He exaggerates when he refers to ""colonizing"" Mars, since the project is a broader look a how astronauts would eat on short-term visits. Also, he exaggerates the appeal of the assignment, which is in a small capsule on a barren landscape. It ain't waterfalls and palm trees.

Steve Stockman says president is spending $2.2 billion to give away ‘ObamaPhones’
","
Before the so-called sequestration budget cuts began taking effect March 1, 2013, U.S. Rep. Steve Stockman had some alternative suggestions for the president.

On Feb. 22, he tweeted about one program he has suggested trimming: ""Obama claims a small cut to federal means losing local police and firefighters, but he's spending $2.2 billion to give away ‘ObamaPhones.’ ""

As far back as 2009, PolitiFact has checked claims about President Barack Obama handing out free cell phones. We decided to see how this statement compared.

The government initiative that helps low-income citizens pay for telephone service is the Federal Communications Commission’s Lifeline program. FCC spokesman Mark Wigfield told us by email that Lifeline began in 1985 because of concerns that local rates would rise after a government lawsuit broke up AT&T’s monopoly of the U.S. phone market.

Lifeline was enshrined in law in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, Wigfield said, then in 2005 and 2008 began to allow ""resellers"" of cell service -- companies that did not own their own networks -- to participate. Today, he said, ""about 75 percent of Lifeline support goes for wireless service.""

The program does not provide phones or phone service and is not paid for by taxes, Wigfield said. Rather, it pays $9.25 a month to a user’s phone company. Some companies give out free phones and price their plans at $9.25 a month, making the plans essentially ""free,"" he said.

Money for Lifeline comes out of the Universal Service Fund; phone companies pay into the fund and then pass the cost on to customers via a fee on their phone bills. (Click here to read more detailed explanations in this story’s excerpted emails.)

Eligible Lifeline participants must have an income that is at or below 135 percent of the federal poverty level or use Medicaid, food stamps, federal public housing assistance or supplemental security income, among other things. In some cases, states administer their own programs.

In early 2012, the FCC implemented changes to Lifeline aimed at modernizing the program and eliminating fraud and waste. One goal: ensuring availability of broadband for all low-income Americans.

The term ""Obama phones"" has been attached to Lifeline since at least late 2009, when PolitiFact rated as Mostly False a chain email claim that Obama was giving away free phones. More famously, a viral video during the 2012 presidential campaign showed an Obama supporter saying ""Everybody in Cleveland -- low (income), minority -- got Obama phones."" Soon after, PolitiFact gave a Florida state official a Pants on Fire rating for saying the Obama campaign was giving out phones.

Both of those PolitiFact ratings cited the fact that the program existed years before Obama took office, so implying he created the program was incorrect. Stockman’s tweet similarly linked the program to Obama but added a financial factor: ""He's spending $2.2 billion to give away ‘ObamaPhones.’ ""

Stockman spokesman Donny Ferguson emailed us a Feb. 12, 2013, Wall Street Journal news story that said, ""The U.S. government spent about $2.2 billion last year to provide phones to low-income Americans ... Payouts under the program have shot up from $819 million in 2008, as more wireless carriers have persuaded regulators to let them offer the service.""

Wigfield sent us the FCC’s total spending figures for Lifeline in recent years: 

The post-2008 boom, he said, came after the FCC decided to open Lifeline to phone companies offering low-cost cell plans on networks they did not own. Tracfone was the first such provider to become an eligible carrier for Lifeline, he said. The Journal article said Tracfone has since become the country’s fifth-largest wireless carrier and that other companies have expanded as ""Lifeline users have been a source of subscriber growth in the otherwise saturated U.S. market.""


Our ruling


Stockman said Obama’s ""spending $2.2 billion to give away ‘ObamaPhones.’ "" That figure’s about right for 2012 federal spending on the Lifeline program, but as PolitiFact has noted before, attributing it to Obama is incorrect.

It’s important to note, too, that the money comes from phone fees, so it wouldn’t be possible to prevent public safety cuts by halting the phone program. The tradeoff Stockman asserts isn’t valid.

We rate his statement as Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/mar/15/steve-stockman/steve-stockman-says-president-spending-22-billion-/
"['Taxes', 'Virginia', 'Jamie Radtke']","
Jamie Radtke says transportation bill would impose ""largest tax increase in Virginia history""
","
Gov. Bob McDonnell stands accused of sanctioning the biggest tax hike in Virginia history.

The charge has been lodged by Jamie Radtke, a Virginia Tea Party organizer, in protest of the General Assembly’s approval last month of a transportation plan that could raise annual taxes by $1.25 billion a year. McDonnell backed the legislation and hailed its passage as ""an historic day in Virginia.""

The bill is sitting on McDonnell’s desk and Radtke is trying to pressure the governor not to sign it. She has started a Facebook page and a petition called ""Stop Largest Tax Increase in Virginia History."" She also narrated a TV ad claiming that McDonnell, who many believe has national ambition, ""pushed the largest tax increase in Virginia history."" The commercial was sponsored by the conservative Patriot Super PAC and aired in Iowa, site of the first presidential caucuses every four years.

All of this leads to an obvious question: Does the transportation bill call for the largest tax increase in Virginia history? We checked.

The package would generate $880 million a year in new state revenues in 2018 when it is fully phased in, according to a report by the House Appropriations Committee. About $680 million of that sum would come from tax increases.

The legislation would replace the current 17.5-cent per-gallon gas tax with a 3.5 percent tax on gasoline and 6 percent diesel tax at the wholesale level. It would raise the 5 percent sales tax to 5.3 percent and increase the 3 percent motor vehicle tax sales tax to 4.3 percent. It also counts on Congress passing legislation that would give states authority to compel online retailers to collect sales tax.

In addition, Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads would be empowered to impose a 0.7 percent local sales tax and other regional levies that could raise a total of $568 million a year for transportation by 2018.

When you combine the new tax revenues for the state with the potential new levies flowing into Northern Virginia and Hampton Roads, the tax package comes to about $1.25 billion a year

We asked Radtke to back up her claim that it all adds up to Virginia’s largest tax increase. ""I’m slammed and don’t have time to pull all that for you right now,"" she replied in a March 5 email. Radtke added that former Gov. Mark Warner ""had the biggest tax increase in 2004, which was $1.4 billion over two years. This one is $1 billion every year. I will see if I can get you more data later.""

Radtke never got back to us.

It’s true that Warner’s 2004 tax increase, often described as record-breaking when it passed, originally generated about $700 million a year. So in terms of raw dollars, Radtke has a point: This year’s take hike, with a potential of producing $1.25 billion annually for state and local coffers, would set a high-water mark.

But Radtke may not have chosen the most meaningful way to compare financial data from different points in time.  Several analysts urged us to account for inflation.

We followed their advice and found that Warner’s tax hike, in today’s dollars, comes to about $860 million a year. That still falls below the $1.25 billion potential of the bill that awaits McDonnell’s signature.  

Warner, however,  is not the only governor in Virginia history who pushed through a tax increase that can be compared to the current plan.

In 1986, Gerald Baliles signed a package of tax hikes that raised $422 million for transportation. Adjusted for inflation, it comes out to $893 million in 2013 dollars. That doesn’t beat this year’s bill, either.

But we got a different result when we went back to 1966 and examined landmark legislation signed by Gov. Mills Godwin that created the state’s sales tax.

The legislation phased in a 3 percent state sales tax over about three years to aid public education, help create Virginia’s community college system and pay for some transportation and administrative expenses. In addition, the law allowed counties and cities to enact a 1 percent sales tax, and all localities did that, according to a 1970 publication by the University of Virginia.

The new levies brought in $282 million during the fiscal year that ended June 30, 1970, according to a report that year by the Department of Taxation. Adjusted for inflation, that comes to $1.68 billion today and easily outpaces the tax increase that McDonnell has endorsed.

Our ruling

Radtke said that the transportation package approved by the General Assembly this year amounts to the largest tax increase in Virginia history. Using raw dollars, she’s correct. But that’s not the whole story.

The value of a dollar changes over time. When inflation is factored, the value of legislation approved in 1966 that created the state’s sales tax would be $1.67 billion annually today. That exceeds the $1.25 billion-a-year potential of this year’s bill.

Radtke’s statement is partially accurate but leaves out important information. That makes it Half True.",/factchecks/2013/mar/15/jamie-radtke/jamie-radtke-says-transportation-bill-would-impose/
"['Health Care', 'Medicaid', 'Florida', 'Will Weatherford']","
Weatherford says 85 percent of people covered by Medicaid expansion are ""single, childless"" adults
","
House Speaker Will Weatherford offered a compelling personal story to emphasize his support for a robust social safety net despite his stance against expanding Medicaid under the federal health care law.

Weatherford’s parents relied on a safety net program -- he didn’t say which one in his speech on the opening day of the legislative session -- to pay medical bills for his 20-month-old brother Peter, who died from cancer.

That program, Weatherford’s father told the Tampa Bay Times/Miami Herald, was funded with Medicaid dollars. The news angered advocates of the expansion who said Weatherford wanted to deny other families relief that helped his own.

""I should have done a better job, and I take ownership of that, of having more facts before I gave my speech,"" Weatherford said on March 8, 2013. ""But it doesn’t change my belief, which is that what we’re talking about is 85 percent of the expansion are for single, childless adults. That’s what this Medicaid expansion goes to. Single, childless adults, it puts them on a government-run system that we potentially will have to pay for.""

Weatherford’s main complaint seems to be that these people are ""able-bodied,"" as he put it (i.e. slackers).

We wanted to give Weatherford’s stat, so instrumental in his opposition to the expansion, the PolitiFact Florida treatment.

Weatherford was referring to internal figures determined by budget experts on his staff, said spokesman Ryan Duffy. But Duffy quickly acknowledged that Weatherford quoted the wrong numbers, which were derived from data supplied by the Legislature’s Social Services Estimating Conference on March 7. 
The 85 percent figure Weatherford cited for ""single, childless adults"" was actually an estimate of all adults who would be covered if Medicaid expanded. (The House's actual estimate is 82 percent.) 
How many of that group would single and childless? We don't know. The state didn't estimate that. 
The closest it came was estimating the impact on childless adults. Duffy said 62 percent of those who would receive Medicaid as part of the expansion would be childless adults. (That makes sense because childless adults currently cannot receive Medicaid under any circumstances in Florida. The expansion would change that.) 
We wondered what other experts know about the percentage of childless adults -- again we can't measure childless and single -- who could get Medicaid coverage under an expansion.

The state’s chief economist, Amy Baker, told us there are many ways of analyzing who could be covered by the Medicaid expansion.

Her group, the Legislative Office of Economic and Demographic Research, identified a pool of 1,079,337 potential Medicaid beneficiaries using public microdata from the American Community Survey. Of that pool, 87 percent were adults 19 and over. Childless adults comprise 67 percent of beneficiaries, Baker said. Non-disabled childless adults (excluding 19- and 20-year-olds) would be 61.8 percent. 
The Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy, which supports the expansion, came up with its own breakdown of who would benefit from the expansion. By the center’s calculations, about 58 percent of the newly eligible would be childless adults.

We should note the center uses a larger pool of newly eligible enrollees than Baker’s group, about 1.3 million people. The center offers a deeper dive into that population: About 22 percent are childless adults who do not have jobs. About 25 percent represent childless workers. The other 10 percent is comprised of young adults age 19-25 and the disabled. (There was not a way to extract the disabled from the center's calculations.)

""This is NOT the number of newly eligible adults that we think would actually enroll in Medicaid,"" said Greg Mellowe, FCEFP director of health research and analysis. ""In fact, not all of those who appear to be eligible based on income will even qualify due to other factors such as immigration status.""

So what about our ruling? We know Weatherford’s assertion that 85 percent of the expansion’s beneficiaries would be childless adults is wrong. (He later corrected the number in an op-ed for the Tampa Bay Times.)

The number should have been, by the House’s calculation, 62 percent. Weatherford, however, erred additionally by referring to only ""single"" adults. No one measures that. 
Weatherford is off on his number and his characterization. 
Yet, the statement contains an element of truth in that Medicaid is expected to benefit childless adults more than any other population. 
We rate his claim Mostly False.",/factchecks/2013/mar/15/will-weatherford/weatherford-says-85-percent-people-covered-medicai/

U.S. Rep. Paul Ryan says fiscal cliff deal is largest tax increase ever
","
In 2011 and 2012, conservatives maligned Obamacare as the largest tax increase in history.

Now House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, the Wisconsin Republican and renowned numbers cruncher, is making the same claim about a different piece of legislation.

In an interview broadcast March 3, 2013, on ""Upfront with Mike Gousha,"" a public affairs show on WISN-TV (Channel 12) in Milwaukee, Gousha asked Ryan:

""You had said that you can’t agree to the president’s call for closing tax loopholes because it would kill tax reform. What do you mean by that?""

Alluding to the New Year’s Day 2013 compromise that averted what had been termed the ""fiscal cliff,"" Ryan began his response by saying:

""So, as you know, the president eight weeks ago got the largest tax increase in history; he got a big tax increase just eight weeks ago. And that gives us certain revenue lines to do tax reform. We have long proposed, in all the budgets I’ve written, to plug loopholes to lower tax rates, to bring down tax rates for Americans, for families, for businesses, to create jobs, to grow the economy.""  

Ryan made the same largest tax increase in history claim three days earlier in an interview on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box.""

But the 2012 vice-presidential candidate, a fiscal hawk, voted for the legislation that averted the fiscal cliff.

So, did that deal really impose the biggest tax increase ever?

Fiscal cliff

The bipartisan fiscal cliff agreement staved off big income tax increases on most Americans and prevented large cuts in spending for the Pentagon and other government programs.

But it also allowed income taxes to rise for the first time in two decades, in this case for those with household incomes of over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for couples.

The deal was a victory for Obama, who had run for re-election pledging to raise taxes on the wealthy.

Some Republicans praised the compromise for cementing income tax cuts for people below the $400,000 and $450,000 levels; those temporary lower rates, put in place under President George W. Bush, were scheduled to expire at the end of 2012.

Ryan’s evidence

Asked for evidence to back Ryan's claim, Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert said the fiscal cliff bill is estimated to raise $650 billion over 10 years and that the ""nominal dollar impact"" makes it the largest-ever tax hike. He  cited a 2006 U.S. Department of Treasury paper on major tax increases.

But by nominal increases, Seifert is referring to the raw dollar amount -- which, given inflation, is not a good way for comparing tax increases over time. Especially for a period as long as ""in history.""

The better way is to measure a tax increase as a percentage of gross domestic product, which shows the relative impact of the increase at the time it was enacted.

Better measure

In 2011, PolitiFact Florida rated as False a claim by GOP Florida Gov. Rick Scott that Obamacare was the biggest tax increase in history; and in 2012, PolitiFact National rated as Pants on Fire a more extreme claim by Rush Limbaugh that the law was ""the largest tax increase in the history of the world.""

Our colleagues used 2019 as a baseline because that's when all of the tax provisions of Obama’s health care reform law will be in effect. They divided the estimated revenue increase in 2019 -- $104 billion -- by the projected gross domestic product for 2019 -- just under $21.2 trillion.

That meant the Obamacare tax increase would amount to 0.49 percent of total GDP.

Using the same Treasury paper Ryan cited, our colleagues found that Obamacare did not rank among the top five tax increases in history, but it was roughly tied for fifth among tax increases since 1968, which is considered the modern era in terms of taxation.

Three tax hikes -- in 1980, 1990 and 1993 -- all were in the ballpark with Obamacare. The largest modern-era tax hike -- at 1.09 percent of gross domestic product -- was a measure adopted in 1968.
 
So, how about the fiscal cliff?

What the experts say 
We ran Ryan’s argument past three experts. Each said the fiscal cliff bill is not the largest-ever tax hike in terms of a percentage of gross domestic product.

Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a project of the Urban Institute and Brookings Institution, told us that using Ryan’s figure -- $650 billion over 10 years -- means the fiscal cliff tax hike amounts to only one-third of 1 percent (0.33) of projected GDP, which is estimated by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office to be $206 trillion for that period (2013-2022).

That’s less than the Obamacare rate of 0.49 percent, which as we pointed out, is smaller than a number of other tax increases.

Kathy Ruffing of the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities gave an estimate similar to Williams’. She said revenue raised by the fiscal cliff bill would amount to 0.4 percent by the fifth year.

That’s lower than measures adopted in the 1980s and 1990s under presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton, according to an updated version of the Treasury paper Ryan cited.

William McBride of the business-backed Tax Foundation said that in ""nominal dollar terms,"" the fiscal cliff tax hike is the largest in history, but ""certainly not as a share of GDP.""

Our rating

Ryan said the fiscal cliff agreement is ""the largest tax increase in history.""

For this type of statement, raw dollars is a virtually meaningless measure, given that it doesn’t truly compare the size of tax increases over time. And as a share of the economy, the fiscal cliff tax increase is clearly not the largest tax increase in history.

Cobb E-SPLOST advocate uses no-debt argument
","
On Tuesday, Cobb County residents will go to the polls to vote on a fourth installment of the school system’s sales tax plan.

The 1-cent special purpose local option sales tax, or SPLOST (E-SPLOST when the tax program is conducted by and for a school system), will be collected for five years beginning in 2014. The system expects to bring in about $717.8 million in tax collections to pay for a host of capital projects.

Opponents of the program say the project list includes unnecessary items that the district ""wants"" but doesn’t need, and that E-SPLOST renewals have become the ""crack cocaine"" of the school system. School system administrators and tax supporters argue that the tax is a good alternative to property tax increases. In addition to that, supporters say, the E-SPLOST has long helped the system’s bottom line by providing money to pay off long-term debts and avoid new bond debt for system projects.

""Cobb is also one of the largest school systems that is debt free,"" education activist JoEllen Smith said in a newspaper editorial published in a local paper last month. ""If SPLOST doesn’t pass, bonds will have to be issued or reserves used.""

PolitiFact Georgia wondered if that enviable position was indeed true. It’s hard for most people to pay off personal consumer debt, let alone a school system responsible for funding the educational needs of just over 108,000 students.

The district, the second largest in the state, has an 11-minute website video that includes the debt-free claim. And some Kennesaw businessmen, Jay Cunningham of Superior Plumbing and John Loud of Loud Security Systems, are featured in a SPLOST advocacy video also making the debt claim.

Smith is a volunteer for EmpowerED Georgia, a group of parents and teachers that estimates its membership at 3,500. She and Cobb Schools spokesman Jay Dillon pointed us to a 2010 census education finance report. That report, issued in June 2012, was taken from 2010 data tables that were updated in November 2012 and collected from each state. Using the updated data, Cobb is listed as the 23rd-largest school system in the country (of the more than 14,000 listed) based on enrollment. Gwinnett County Public Schools -- Georgia’s largest school system -- is ranked 14th.

The report shows that Cobb has zero long-term outstanding debt at the end of the fiscal year. The system also has no short-term debt, Dillon said. Gwinnett is not in the same fortunate financial position as Cobb. Gwinnett still has almost $580 million in debt on the books to be paid off, a schools spokesman told us. That county funds its construction projects through a portion of property tax collections, and will use current E-SPLOST revenue to pay off bonds that were used to finance some projects.

The census report showed that Clayton County was the only other metro Atlanta school system without any long-term debt. Clayton County Public Schools, ranked 88th in size, paid off its last bond debt as part of a SPLOST passed in 1998, a district spokesman told PolitiFact Georgia.

Cobb’s current five-year E-SPLOST expires Dec. 31, 2013. Approval from voters next week would keep the sales tax collections continuous through 2018. The money is expected to pay for several new gyms, theaters and wings, along with 407 new classrooms, at schools throughout the district.

Getting approval from voters could be a challenge. In 2011, a four-year extension of the county’s SPLOST for parks, recreation and road renovation throughout Cobb passed by only 79 votes. And a 10-year regional transportation SPLOST failed in Cobb by almost 38 percentage points.

Paying for capital projects, like new schools and classroom expansions, with E-SPLOST funds is quite common in Georgia, said Herb Garrett, executive director of the Georgia School Superintendents Association.

Before the E-SPLOST legislation was passed, school systems had to pay for projects through their operating funds intended for day-to-day expenses, or through bonds. Under the bond method, the money was immediately available but was paid back with interest over several years, instead of the pay-as-you-go method of financing projects with E-SPLOST collections.

Using E-SPLOST funds, Cobb Schools paid off $184 million in bond debt in 2007. The school system has incurred no additional debt since then, meaning it has no outstanding bonds or loans, a state Education Department spokeswoman told us.

""The SPLOST program has allowed a rapidly growing state to meet its need for school buildings,"" Garrett said.

So what’s the fiscal fallout?

Education activist and education sales tax supporter JoEllen Smith said that Cobb County Schools is one of the largest systems in the nation that is debt free.

The district is the second largest in the state, and is the 23rd largest in the country, according to the Census Bureau.

Cobb Schools has used previous sales tax collections to pay off long-term bond debt, which education experts said is common practice in Georgia. This pay-as-you-go system of funding projects has kept the county school system debt free.

"['Economy', 'Jobs', 'Florida', 'Marco Rubio']","
Marco Rubio says 3 million jobs unfilled due to lack of skills
","
During his speech to the annual CPAC conference of conservative activists, Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., said one key for economic growth is to have workers with better skills.

""There are 3 million jobs available in America that are not filled because too many of our people don’t have the skills for those jobs,"" Rubio said in his March 14, 2013, speech.

Coincidentally, just moments before Rubio uttered those words, we posted a fact check of a similar comment by Rep. Virginia Foxx, R-N.C. Foxx had said in a House floor speech that ""there are 3.6 million jobs sitting vacant, in part because there aren’t enough qualified applicants to fill them.""

Because the analysis required for both quotes is so similar, we will rely heavily here on the Foxx fact-check. But while we rated Foxx’s claim Mostly True, Rubio’s statement was worded differently. Foxx hedged her comment by saying that it was ""in part"" because of unqualified applications, but Rubio’s wording suggests that all the vacancies stem from skill shortages.
   
We turned to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the federal government’s scorekeeper on employment data.
   
The 3 million figure Rubio used is similar to the 3.6 million figure Foxx cited. It comes from a monthly survey called the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey, or JOLTS. The most recent seasonally adjusted data covers January 2013 and showed that there were just under 3.7 million job openings in January, up slightly from 3.6 million in December 2012.

But Rubio specifically said ""there are 3 million jobs available in America that are not filled because too many of our people don’t have the skills for those jobs."" A close look at the survey reveals it doesn’t actually support that thesis.

The bureau’s official definition of a ""job opening"" is ""a specific position of employment to be filled at an establishment"" that satisfy these conditions: ""there is work available for that position, the job could start within 30 days, and the employer is actively recruiting for the position.""

However, there are always job openings -- even in a healthy economy. In a phenomenon known as ""churn,"" people change jobs. Just because their old job is unoccupied when the BLS takes its monthly data snapshot doesn’t necessarily mean that the employer is having trouble filling the job, or finding the skills of the applicants lacking. Rather, the employer could simply be going through the process of hiring, with the job filled a month later.

Over the past decade, the December monthly totals for job openings have ranged from 2.9 million to 4.4 million.

So, if Rubio means to say that 3 million of the 3.7 million job openings are open due to skill shortfalls, he has no way of knowing that because that sort of data is not collected. The same is true if he was simply using ""3 million"" as shorthand for ""3.7 million.""

The data from this survey  ""has important limitations,"" said Steven J. Davis, an economist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, because it ""provides little information about the distribution of vacancy durations"" and ""no direct information about the reason why some job openings take a long time to fill.""

So what can we say about the scale of the skills mismatch? It boils down largely to a battle of anecdotes.

Rubio’s office didn’t get back to us for this story, but Foxx’s office provided links to a variety of news reports that suggest a divergence between applicants’ job skills and the ones employers are seeking. Economists we consulted agreed that that is part of the issue, particularly for high-skill jobs. But it’s probably not the only reason.
   
For instance, there appears to be a ""hiring paralysis"" among employers who are acting with unusual caution because they are uncertain whether the economy will remain strong rather than stagnating, according to economists and hiring professionals quoted in the New York Times earlier this year.
   
Our ruling
   
Rubio said, ""There are 3 million jobs available in America that are not filled because too many of our people don’t have the skills for those jobs.""

If one allows him some space for using shorthand, Rubio is basically right that there are ""3 million jobs available in America."" But while there is anecdotal evidence of a job-skills shortage, there is no data to prove his contention that the 3 million jobs in question are all open because of a mismatch in job skills. In fact, there’s significant evidence to contradict it -- the fact that the statistics in question always capture normal job churn, for instance, and the signs of ""hiring paralysis"" among employers.

Pro-ACA group: Court pick Kavanaugh refused to uphold pre-existing condition ban
","A new ad from a group with strong Democratic ties aims to pressure three Democratic senators in North Dakota, West Virginia and Indiana to vote against Brett Kavanaugh as the next Supreme Court justice. The ad, made by the liberal group Demand Justice, focuses on protections for people with pre-existing conditions in the Affordable Care Act, saying all would be at risk with Kavanaugh on the court. ""The Senate is about to consider Brett Kavanaugh to be the next Supreme Court justice,"" the ad says. ""Kavanaugh refused to uphold key patient protections in the past, and if he joins the court he could vote to end these protections for good."" No one can say for sure what Kavanaugh might do in the future, but we can look at whether he refused to uphold patient protections in the past. The statement hangs on Kavanaugh’s dissent in a 2011 case that challenged the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act. The argument made to Kavanaugh and two other appellate court judges was that Congress had overstepped its constitutional powers. Two of the judges nixed the challenge, saying that, yes, Congress actually did have the power. Kavanaugh also rejected the challenge, but for a totally different, technical reason. Basically, he said it was too early for the court to rule. So, both the two judges and Kavanaugh reached the same place, but his fellow judges upheld Congress’s power to impose the mandate, and Kavanaugh, by sidestepping that question, did not. Notice that the case wasn’t directly about patient protections, most notably the ban on denying coverage based on a pre-existing health condition. But all the judges agreed that those protections and the mandate were joined at the hip. They all said that the mandate made the patient protections work economically. The dividing line was two judges affirmed Congress’s power to make the package work and Kavanaugh did not. But he still rejected the challenge. In the case of Seven-Sky vs. Holder, a group of taxpayers argued that the health care law’s requirement to buy health insurance went beyond the legitimate power of Congress. Two out of the three appellate judges rejected the challenge outright, saying that the mandate was allowed under the Constitution’s Commerce Clause. In his dissent, Kavanaugh shot down the challenge but pointedly avoided ruling on the plaintiffs’ big issue. ""I do not take a position here on whether the statute as currently written is justifiable under the Taxing Clause or the Commerce Clause,"" he wrote. Instead, he rejected the claim based on tax law. He said the suit itself was flawed because an 1867 law — the Anti-Injunction Act — blocks courts from ruling on tax laws before they take effect. It was 2011, and the mandate didn’t come into force until 2014, so ""a suit challenging the individual mandate cannot be entertained until 2015."" Where do patient protections come into this? Well, key protections, most prominently the ban on denying coverage based on a pre-existing condition, come hand-in-hand with the mandate in Obamacare. As Kavanaugh saw it, you can’t have one without the other. Another name for that ban is guaranteed coverage, and during oral arguments, Kavanaugh said that part of the Affordable Care Act was fine. ""Congress has the power to impose a guaranteed issue requirement on insurance companies,"" he said. Going further, there’s no mistaking that Kavanaugh saw the link to the mandate. ""It won’t work without an individual mandate attached to it,"" he said. ""We know that from the states that have tried it that way. It didn’t work. Massachusetts tried it with the mandate and it’s worked extremely well, at least in terms of the goal of coverage."" So Kavanaugh was content to give patient protections the constitutional thumbs up, but when it came to the other half of the equation, the mandate, he said it was too soon to make a decision on its constitutionality. For the makers of the ad, this is very simple. ""Two judges upheld the Affordable Care Act and its patient protections, and he declined to uphold it,"" Demand Justice executive director Brian Fallon said. ""He could have joined their opinion and upheld it on the merits and he didn't."" For outside legal experts, the situation is much cloudier. ""The group’s statement is technically true, although a bit misleading,"" said Allison K. Hoffman at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. ""Kavanaugh never said that the mandate was unconstitutional. He painstakingly avoided opining on its constitutionality. He spent 65 excruciatingly dense pages of opinion repeatedly calling it a tax, the very thing Congress avoided doing because they knew it would be unpopular."" James Blumstein at Vanderbilt agreed that by taking no position on the reach of the Commerce Clause, Kavanaugh succeeded in placing himself in the gray zone regarding congressional power. ""Kavanaugh was unwilling to endorse the Affordable Care Act under the Commerce Clause,"" Blumstein said. ""He wanted to avoid having to decide what was for him a hard question."" In his dissent, Kavanaugh emphasized an important principle that stands apart from assessing congressional power: judicial restraint. That’s the idea that courts should not get ahead of the political process that plays out in the nation and Congress. ""I see in his declining to address that issue (the mandate) only normal judicial prudence of not deciding issues unless the case requires them to be decided,"" Wake Forest University’s Mark Hall told us. And law professor David Gamage at Indiana University said Kavanaugh’s dissent makes him neither ""pro-Affordable Care Act, nor anti-Affordable Care Act."" The group Demand Justice said that Kavanaugh refused to uphold patient protections. Looking at the record, it is fair to say that he did not uphold the power of Congress to impose the individual insurance mandate. That is one step removed from upholding patient protections, but Kavanaugh said that the two are tightly linked, and there’s broad agreement on that point. But while he didn’t uphold that power, his dissent didn’t specifically negate it. Outside legal scholars said there’s only so much one can read into his opinion. In oral arguments, Kavanaugh said both that the patient protections are legal and that in order to work in the marketplace, they require the individual mandate.   In his dissent, he avoided saying whether Congress has the power to impose the mandate, thus leaving the viability of the patient protections in limbo.

Did Senate candidate Leah Vukmir seek 'leniency' for fellow lawmaker convicted of sexual assault?
","The national anti-tax group Club for Growth, whose political action committee is backing conservatives in seven U.S. Senate and House races around the country, released a TV ad through one of its affiliates that attacks Leah Vukmir. The ad, produced by CFG Action Wisconsin and released July 12, 2018, makes a series of claims against the Wisconsin Republican, starting with this one: ""Vukmir wrote a letter seeking leniency for a fellow state legislator convicted of sexual assault."" As we’ll see, Vukmir did write a letter that was clearly in support of the lawmaker. The case Vukmir, a suburban Milwaukee state senator, and political newcomer Kevin Nicholson, who is endorsed by Club for Growth, are running in the GOP primary on Aug. 14, 2018. The winner will face Democrat Tammy Baldwin on Nov. 6, 2018. See all of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. The TV ad footnotes a Milwaukee Journal Sentinel news article that revealed the existence of Vukmir’s letter. The letter was sent on behalf of then-Rep. Bill Kramer of the Town of Waukesha, the onetime Republican leader of the state Assembly. According to the December 2017 article, which cited court records as a source: Vukmir wrote a brief character reference letter for Kramer in 2014, a month after Kramer pleaded no contest to two counts of fourth-degree sexual assault, both misdemeanors, in a plea bargain. He originally was charged with two felonies. The letter was sent to the judge in Waukesha County, in suburban Milwaukee, just before the judge sentenced Kramer to three years of probation that included five months in jail with work-release privileges. The conviction stemmed from a 2011 incident outside a Republican Party event at a tavern. The victim told the court she feared Kramer might rape her after she resisted his advances, which included shoving her against a car, forcibly kissing her, putting his hands up her shirt and grabbing her groin. The victim did not report it at the time, but came forward after Kramer allegedly groped a legislative aide’s breasts and bragged about his sexual prowess to a female lobbyist at a 2014 fundraiser in Washington, D.C. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. The letter Here’s what Vukmir’s letter said: I have known Bill Kramer for over 12 years and consider him a friend. I have known Bill when he was drinking and I have known Bill when he was not drinking. By the time of his sentencing, Bill will have been sober for 270 days. Being sober has had a profound impact on Bill for the better. I also think it is important to recognize that Bill became sober under his own volition. Bill became sober to improve his life, not because he was sent to a court-mandated program. I believe this change has improved Bill’s life considerably. Analysis Club for Growth spokesman Bob Pipkin defended the group’s claim by referring us to an article about the disclosure of Vukmir’s letter in the Wisconsin Gazette, which describes itself as a progressive, alternative newspaper. ""We took the interpretation of a liberal Wisconsin newspaper; they interpreted it as leniency,"" he told us. A caption to a photo with the article says Vukmir sought leniency, although the headline and the first sentence of the article merely said Vukmir sent a letter supporting Kramer. Mattias Gugel, a Vukmir campaign spokesman, told us: ""The accusation that Leah wrote a letter asking for leniency is a blatant lie. She simply spoke about a colleague seeking help for addiction issues."" But it’s not as though Vukmir’s letter would have been seen by the judge as urging a harsher sentence for Kramer rather than a lighter one. We also sought views from two lawyers based in Waukesha County, where Kramer is from and where the crime occurred. Criminal defense lawyer Jerome Buting, known for his work on the case made famous by the film ""Making a Murderer,"" said Vukmir’s letter does seek leniency: If you write a letter on behalf of a defendant at sentencing, most of the time I think it’s reasonable to assume that’s seeking leniency, whether it’s expressed that way or not. You're trying to convey to the judge that this one incident doesn’t necessarily portray everything about his (the defendant’s) character, and that is one of the big factors the court has to consider in sentencing. Paul Bucher, who does criminal defense work and is the former district attorney in Waukesha County, disagreed, saying some letters explicitly ask for leniency or no jail time and Vukmir’s doesn't: We do character letters all the time because all the court really knows about the client is what is in the criminal complaint. So, the job of a defense  lawyer is to give the judge a broader picture of who is standing in front of him. (Vukmir’s letter is) a pretty standard, boilerplate, character letter.
  But even if it doesn’t go far as some, Vukmir’s letter clearly was written to help Kramer. Our rating Club for Growth says Vukmir ""wrote a letter seeking leniency for a fellow state legislator convicted of sexual assault."" It’s fair to say that letters written on behalf of criminal defendants facing sentencing cover a range. Vukmir’s letter to the judge in Kramer’s case is limited to Kramer’s character. It doesn’t go as far as some letters in such cases that explicitly ask for leniency or lighter treatment, such as probation rather than jail. But while the word leniency might mean different things to different people, it’s clear that Vukmir’s letter was written to benefit Kramer — in other words, seeking a lighter sentence, rather than a harsher one. We rate Club for Growth’s statement Mostly True. Editor's note: This item was corrected on July 18, 2018, after it was first published, to clarify the Club for Growth entities.  ",/factchecks/2018/jul/18/club-growth/did-senate-candidate-leah-vukmir-seek-leniency-fel/

Sean Hannity cites misleading Obama quote in coverage of Russian election meddling
","Moments before airing his interview with President Donald Trump in Helsinki, Fox News host Sean Hannity slammed former President Barack Obama for his pre-election rhetoric on Russia. But Hannity’s remarks were misleading, and the words he attributed to Obama were taken out of context. ""We all know that Russian election meddling is not new at all,"" Hannity said in his opening monologue on July 16. ""And despite this, in 2016, when Hillary Clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls — oh, just before the election — it was President Obama who laughed off any notion that American elections could possibly be tampered with."" Hannity pointed to Obama’s remarks at a press conference on Oct. 18, 2016, a day after a stump speech in which Trump announced what he believed was evidence in support of his repeated claims about voter fraud in the 2016 election. Hannity quoted Obama as saying: ""There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America's elections. There's no evidence that that has happened in the past or that there are instances in which that will happen this time."" Hannity later read an altered version of the same quote as part of a question for Trump about Russia’s election meddling. Hannity repeated the claim a third time while interviewing guests. What Hannity did not mention, however, was that Obama’s remarks actually came in response to a reporter’s question about voter fraud and Trump’s claims that the election could be rigged. Obama was not making reference to Russian interference. (For more on Russia’s election meddling, read our on-the-record timeline of events.) ""Donald Trump is telling his supporters that the election is rigged and asking them to monitor certain areas on election day,"" NPR’s Ayesha Rascoe said. ""How concerned are you about the potential for violence? And what about after election day — are you worried the results of the election may be distrusted?"" A more complete version of Obama’s response can be read below, with the portions referenced by Hannity in bold: ""I have never seen in my lifetime or in modern political history any presidential candidate trying to discredit the elections and the election process before votes have even taken place. It's unprecedented. It happens to be based on no facts. Every expert, regardless of political party, regardless of ideology — conservative or liberal — who has ever examined these issues in a serious way will tell you that instances of significant voter fraud are not to be found … ""If you start whining before the game is even over, if whenever things are going badly for you and you lose you start blaming somebody else, then you don’t have what it takes to be in this job. Because there are a lot of times when things don’t go our way, or my way.  That’s okay. You fight through it, you work through it. You try to accomplish your goals. ""But the larger point that I want to emphasize here is that there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections, in part because they’re so decentralized and the numbers of votes involved. There’s no evidence that that has happened in the past, or that there are instances in which that will happen this time. And so I’d advise Mr. Trump to stop whining and go try to make his case to get votes."" Hannity is not the first person to pluck out this quote. Trump, who appeared to accept Russian President Vladimir Putin’s denial of Russian election interference during a press conference before Hannity’s interview, did the same in tweets on Feb. 20, 2018. ""(Obama) thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to ‘rock the boat,’"" Trump wrote. ""When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems.""  “There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections, there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so I’d invite Mr. Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes.” .....  ....The President Obama quote just before election. That’s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat.” When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems. Several news and fact-checking websites pointed out that Trump took Obama’s words out of context. The Obama administration did receive some criticism for its quiet response to Russian interference, which the administration learned of in the months leading up to the election. But as we have noted in previous fact-checks, it is an exaggeration to say Obama did nothing. By the Oct. 28, 2016, press conference, Obama had personally confronted Putin about it at the G20 Summit in China. Intelligence agencies under Obama’s administration had also accused Russia of being responsible for hacking and leaking emails from the Democratic National Committee and others, issuing a joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and the Director of National Intelligence. So Obama did show concern — and he was responding to Trump’s early claims of a rigged election based on voter fraud when he made the comment Hannity singled out.   From Hannity’s side, a Fox News spokesperson pointed to reports from the Washington Post and Reuters that former President Barack Obama was informed of Russian meddling as early as the summer of 2016, months before he stated that ""there is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections."" Hannity said, ""In 2016, when Hillary Clinton appeared to have a firm lead in the polls — oh, just before the election — it was President Obama who laughed off any notion that American elections could possibly be tampered with."" The quote Hannity used was out of context when presented as the basis of a misleading argument about Obama’s response to Russian meddling. Obama was actually responding to Trump’s claims about voter fraud potentially changing the outcome of the election. We rate Hannity’s statement Mostly False.

Donald Trump's questionable claim that Electoral College favors the Democrats
","It may be more than a year and a half since the presidential election, but time and again, President Donald Trump has brought up his Electoral College victory in 2016 — even at unexpected moments, such as the joint press conference he held with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki on July 16, 2018. At one point, Trump said, ""The Democrats lost an election which, frankly, they should have been able to win, because the Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats, as you know, than it is to Republicans."" When we checked with political experts, they expressed skepticism that the Electoral College is ""much more advantageous to the Democrats,"" particularly today. During the 2016 campaign, there was a widespread belief among the public that there was a ""blue wall"" of solidly Democratic states protecting Clinton. It’s human nature to assume what has happened previously will continue into the future. So after Barack Obama, a Democrat, won the 2008 and 2012 elections, some assumed that the Democrats would have a leg up in 2016 as well. To take just one example, in 2014, a column in the conservative Washington Examiner was headlined, ""How the Electoral College favors Democrats and why Republicans must change it."" The column argued that the Democrats start with a base of 242 electoral votes, compared with just 170 for the Republicans. Under that scenario, the Democrats would need just 28 more electoral votes to clinch the presidency; the Republicans would have a much tougher road to winning. But there’s a catch: To get to that 242 number, the column lumped in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin — with a collective 46 electoral votes — with those Democratic base states. There was some logic to that decision, as each of the three states had voted for the Democratic nominee in the previous six presidential elections. And in the case of Michigan and Wisconsin at least, Hillary Clinton’s campaign effectively agreed, largely skipping appearances in those states as Election Day neared. But there are two problems with using this argument as support for Trump’s assertion. First, the notion that Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin are bedrock Democratic states was shattered by Trump himself. And his victory undermines his assertion in Helsinki -- in the present tense -- that the Electoral College favors Democrats. Any Democratic candidate in the future isn’t going to make the same mistake Clinton did. They will consider each of these three to be battleground states. Second, contrary to the ""media narrative,"" professional election handicappers never considered Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin to be Democratic locks. While the Democrats had won them for six elections running, independent analysts typically considered them battleground states. The following chart summarizes the ratings that several nonpartisan handicappers gave to Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin in the 2008, 2012, and 2016 elections, where accessible online. The handicappers are the Cook Political Report, Inside Elections, Larry Sabato’s Crystal Ball, and this author (for Stateline.org in 2008, and for Governing magazine in 2012 and 2016). These analysts use first-hand reporting, past history, and polls to produce a subjective assessment of each state; they are not mathematical models based only on poll results. The ratings ""lean Democratic"" and ""toss-up"" mean that a state is considered competitive. ""Likely Democratic"" is not considered to be competitive, but is less safe than the most solid category, ""safe Democratic."" The ratings shown are for each group’s final handicapping before Election Day.   State Cook 2008 Cook 2012 Cook 2016 I.E. 2016 Sabato 2012 Sabato 2016 Stateline 2008 Govering 2012 Governing 2016 Mich. Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Likely D Lean D Likely D Lean D Lean D Pa. Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Lean D Wis. Lean D Lean D Lean D Tossup Lean D Likely D Likely D Tossup Lean D In every analysis, Pennsylvania was considered a lean Democratic state — that is, the Democrats had an edge, but the contest was competitive and hardly in the bag. Wisconsin was considered a toss-up state (the most competitive category of all) or a lean Democratic state a clear majority of the time. And Michigan was considered a lean Democratic state a clear majority of the time. So while the popular perception was that, since the Democrats had won six straight elections in each of those states they were bound to win again, professional handicappers had a more nuanced view of the Democrats’ chances in those states. This caveat didn’t always get picked up in the larger discussion. In reality, a reasonable breakdown of ""base"" states for each party — particularly after the 2016 results have added another data point — would give Republicans at least 179 electoral votes that are pretty safe in today’s environment. They are: Alabama (9 electoral votes), Alaska (3), Arkansas (6), Georgia (16), Idaho (4), Indiana (11), Kansas (6), Kentucky (8), Louisiana (8), Mississippi (6), Missouri (10), Montana (3), Nebraska (4 of 5 electoral votes), North Dakota (3), Oklahoma (7), South Carolina (9), South Dakota (3), Tennessee (11), Texas (38), Utah (6), West Virginia (5) and Wyoming (3). For their part, the Democrats can rely pretty solidly on states worth 187 electoral votes: California (55), Connecticut (7), Delaware (3), District of Columbia (3), Hawaii (4), Illinois (20), Maryland (10), Massachusetts (11), New Jersey (14), New York (29), New Mexico (5), Oregon (7), Rhode Island (4), Vermont (3) and Washington state (12). This leaves the following states in the battleground category and assigned to neither party, with a combined 172 electoral votes: Arizona (11), Colorado (9), Florida (29), Iowa (6), Maine (4), Michigan (16), Minnesota (10), Nebraska (1 of 5 electoral votes), Nevada (6), New Hampshire (4), North Carolina (15), Ohio (18), Pennsylvania (20), Virginia (13), and Wisconsin (10). Is this breakdown subject to disagreement? Absolutely; this list has a relatively generous threshold for counting a state as a battleground. Reasonable people will disagree. But if it’s in the ballpark, then the breakdown is 187 electoral votes to start for the Democrats, 179 to start for the Republicans, and 172 up for grabs. It’s hard to call that ""much more advantageous for the Democrats."" Contrary to Trump’s assertion, there’s evidence that the Republicans may actually benefit from the Electoral College system. In the five most-recent elections starting with 2000, the Republicans have twice lost the popular vote but won the presidency thanks to the Electoral College. In 2000, Democrat Al Gore defeated Republican George W. Bush by more than 547,000 votes nationally. In 2016, Clinton defeated Trump by an even larger margin — almost 2.9 million votes. Neither of the popular vote winners became president. ""That certainly doesn’t suggest the Electoral College has a Democratic bias. In fact, it indicates the opposite,"" said Kyle Kondik, managing editor of Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. Two factors explain why today’s political environment, if anything, gives Republican states a leg up in the electoral college. First, smaller states get a disproportionately large impact in the Electoral College, because each state (plus the District of Columbia) gets a guaranteed two electoral votes before the rest of the electoral votes are allotted based on House seats (and thus, indirectly, on population). While there are some smaller blue states, the smallest states are disproportionately Republican-leaning. For instance, deep-red Wyoming gets one electoral vote for roughly 193,000 people, while deep-blue California gets one for every 719,000. An even bigger impact today may stem from the demographic makeup of the battleground states that shifted from Obama to Trump. Whites without college degrees — a key base of Trump’s support — ""are overrepresented in swing states as compared to the country as a whole,"" Nate Silver of fivethirtyeight.com has written. ""Sure, there were some exceptions, such as Virginia. But in the average swing state … whites without college degrees make up an average of 45.3 percent of the electorate, higher than their 41.6 percent share nationwide. That’s a big part of why Clinton won the popular vote while losing the Electoral College."" Kondik said that as of today, ""the Electoral College has a Trump lean because of his white, non-college coalition being an above-average share of the electorate in the key swing states of the Frost Belt. I say ‘Trump lean’ because that advantage might not be apparent for other Republicans with different coalitions in the future."" Kondik’s point about changing coalitions making a difference brings up another issue: There doesn’t appear to be a permanent bias for either party, since electorates and demographics change over time. ""I don't believe either party has had a long-lasting lean in the Electoral College,"" said David Wasserman, an analyst for the Cook Political Report. Trump said that ""the Electoral College is much more advantageous for Democrats."" There may have been a popular misperception prior to the 2016 election that Democrats had a large number of solidly blue states that made it much easier for them to reach 270 than the Republicans. But professional handicappers never considered states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin to be solid for the Democrats, even in the 2008 and 2012 elections — and any notion that they continue to be solidly Democratic going forward was exploded by Trump’s wins in those states, making his use of the present tense dubious. There may even be a modest Republican lean to the Electoral College in this political moment, but we couldn’t find evidence of a permanent bias either way.

No evidence of political motives in ambassador attack
","The former British ambassador to the United States was hospitalized after being attacked in a tube station. Police are still investigating the altercation, which left Sir Christopher Meyer bloodied but in stable condition. Some bloggers have connected the attack with President Donald Trump’s visit the next day and the protests that went alongside it. On July 13, protesters gathered in the city, guiding a large, baby Trump balloon past Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Meanwhile, Trump met with Prime Minister Theresa May at a military demonstration. Earlier that week, Meyer was beaten in the Victoria London Underground Station. An article, posted on clickbait site Neon Nettle, claimed that Meyer was ""savagely beaten to a bloody pulp by a gang of anti-Trump protestors because he ‘welcomed’ the U.S. president to the United Kingdom."" This seemed out of line with other reports of the event, which did not mention political motives. We decided to investigate whether Trump’s visit was tied directly to Meyer’s attack. A few days before the protests, the Independent published an editorial written by Meyer. That same day, he was attacked. In the piece, Meyer cautioned protesters against angering Trump. ""Our security and prosperity depend in large measure on keeping our close and long-standing partnership in good working order,"" he writes. Meyer argued that in spite of Trump pulling the United States out of the Iran nuclear deal and the Paris agreement on climate change, engaging with the president and maintaining close ties between the countries is imperative. Neon Nettle hypothesized that this show of support was enough to rile up ""a gang of anti-Trump protestors."" Meyer’s wife told The Times that she suspected the attack was politically motivated: ""He is opinionated, and sometimes people have different opinions."" However, London police said it is more likely that Meyer’s assailants wanted to rob him. There has been no evidence released thus far to tie the attack to the protests or to suggest that Meyer was targeted. The Neon Nettle article says that Meyer was attacked by ""a mob of thugs"" involved with the protests against Trump. However, only two suspects were arrested: a 15-year-old girl and 16-year-old boy. They were released from custody while the investigation into their involvement continues, according to a press release by the British Transport Police. Additionally, the attack took place on Wednesday, July 11, two full days before the official protests and a day before Trump arrived in the country. The Neon Nettle also alleges that ""violent riots"" have occurred throughout London in response to Trump’s visit. While there were massive protests against Trump in the capital, there were few news reports of violence. In a single altercation outside of a pub, one man was arrested for hitting a Trump supporter. There has been no evidence released linking the attack of a former ambassador to Trump’s visit to the United Kingdom.  Meyer was beaten by two teenagers, not a ""gang of anti-Trump protestors,"" as Neon Nettle alleges. The protests against Trump, which took place two days after the attack, were relatively uneventful as far as violence goes. Because police are still investigating the incident, we cannot conclusively say that it was not motivated by politics. However, for that same reason, Neon Nettle goes too far to say that it was. Further, it is an overstatement to say that the anti-Trump protests were ""violent riots.""

Donald Trump's 'missing' server comments get all of the details wrong
","Standing beside Russian President Vladimir Putin, President Donald Trump answered reporters' questions about Russia’s interference in the 2016 election and if he believed Putin’s denials over his own intelligence community’s findings. Instead of answering the question directly, Trump began discussing servers. ""You have groups that are wondering why the FBI never took the server -- haven't they taken the server. Why was the FBI told to leave the office of the Democratic National Committee? I've been wondering that, I've been asking that for months and months and I've been tweeting it out and calling it out on social media. Where is the server? I want to know where is the server and what is the server saying? ""With that being said, all I can do is ask the question. My people came to me, Dan Coats came to me and some others, they said they think it's Russia. I have President Putin; he just said it's not Russia. I will say this: I don't see any reason why it would be. But I really do want to see the server."" Moments later, Trump added, ""What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC? Where are those servers? They're missing; where are they?"" Trump's rhetorical question gets the details wrong. You could take Trump's words to mean a DNC server has gone missing, but that's not true. And as for the ""Pakistani gentleman,"" Trump is referring to a House IT staffer who did not work for the DNC and who government investigators concluded did not steal or leak computer data. On July 13, the Justice Department charged 12 Russian intelligence officers with hacking the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, and Hillary Clinton campaign staffers. Special counsel Robert Mueller’s indictment confirms previous findings from the U.S. intelligence community. In April 2016, Russian intelligence officials installed spying software on the computer network of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, which works to elect members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The hack in turn allowed them access to 33 Democratic National Committee computers. The emails obtained through the hack were pushed out on social media beginning in June 2016, and Wikileaks soon joined that effort. At some point, the FBI and DNC started working together to fight the hack and investigate how it happened, but DNC was slow to react to the FBI’s initial warning that their server had been compromised. During former FBI director James Comey’s testimony to the House Intelligence Committee, Comey was asked whether the FBI had ever received the DNC’s hacked hardware. He said they did not, but obtained access from a review of the system performed by CrowdStrike, a third-party cybersecurity firm. ""We got the forensics from the pros that they hired which -- again, best practice is always to get access to the machines themselves, but this, my folks tell me, was an appropriate substitute,"" Comey said. DNC spokeswoman Adrienne Watson told PolitiFact that the DNC cooperated with the FBI’s requests, which resulted in the DNC providing a copy of their server. ""An image of a server is the best thing to use in an investigation so that your exploration of the server does not change the evidence (just like you don’t want investigators leaving their own DNA around a physical crime scene) and so that the bad actors cannot make changes to the evidence while you are looking at it,"" Watson said. ""Any suggestion that they were denied access to what they wanted for their investigation is completely incorrect."" We found no indication that the FBI had renewed their request to gain access to the actual server, or that investigating the server copy would have prevented the FBI from tracking down the culprits. (The FBI declined to comment.) Trump said, ""What happened to the servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC?"" Trump was likely referring to Imran Awan who worked in information technology for dozens of Democrats in the U.S. House of Representatives, including U.S. Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chair of the Democratic National Committee. Trump previously referred to Awan as the ""Pakistani mystery man."" Trump is wrong, though, that Awan ""worked on the DNC."" The national committee is a separate group from the House members. Awan’s lawyer Christopher Gowen, as well as the DNC spokeswoman, told PolitiFact that Awan never worked for the DNC. Awan, who emigrated from Pakistan as a youth, has been a U.S. citizen since 2004. ""The government that Donald Trump is the president of has had the server from the very, very beginning of the investigation,"" Gowen said, referring to the server maintained by Awan and accessed by House Democrats, and a server all together different than the one hacked into atthe DNC. Gowen said the server was a portal that Democratic members could access when working remotely. He said it has been in possession of the FBI and the Capitol Police since the first allegations were made in the case and has nothing to do with the DNC. Awan was arrested for bank fraud in July after he identified on a home loan application that a property was a primary residence when in fact it was a rental property. Trump was parroting news reports led by the Daily Caller about Awan. Conservative media accounts suggested that Awan might have played a role in the election hacking of the DNC, although the U.S. intelligence community has concluded that the Russian government directed the recent compromises of emails from U.S. persons and institutions, including from U.S. political organizations. Ultimately, Awan was charged with a minor offense unrelated to his job. In a July 3 plea agreement, Awan agreed to plead guilty to making a false statement on a loan application. The government engaged in a ""thorough investigation"" that included taking custody of the House Democratic server and found no evidence of wrongdoing related to his House IT job, the government stated in the plea agreement signed by U.S Attorney’s Office. ""The government has found no evidence that your client illegally removed House data from the House network or from House Members' offices, stole the House Democratic Caucus Server, stole or destroyed House information technology equipment, or improperly accessed or transferred government information, including classified or sensitive information,"" said the plea agreement signed by the U.S. Attorney’s Office. Awan will be sentenced Aug. 21. Sentencing guidelines call for zero to six months in jail, but prosecutors agreed not to oppose a sentence of only probation. Trump said, ""The servers of the Pakistani gentleman that worked on the DNC"" are ""missing."" The DNC servers were never missing. The DNC provided the FBI with a copy of their server, rather than the original hardware, but Comey testified that the evidence was an appropriate substitute. Awan, the ""Pakistani gentleman"" in the news, never worked for the DNC. Conservative news outlets suggested he had stolen a House Democratic server, but the U.S. Attorney’s Office found no evidence of such theft.

Putin's Pants-on-Fire claim about $400 million donation to Clinton from Bill Browder partners
","Russian President Vladimir Putin offered a novel idea to advance the Russia investigation during a joint news conference with President Donald Trump in Helsinki. Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s team could come to his country, Putin said, if Russian investigators were allowed to go the United States to dig into alleged tax evasion by American-born financier Bill Browder and his associates. ""Business associates of Mr. Browder have earned over 1.5 billion dollars in Russia,"" Putin said through a translator. ""They never paid any taxes."" Putin continued. ""They sent a huge amount of money, over 400 million, as a contribution to the campaign of Hillary Clinton,"" he said. ""Well, that’s their personal case. It might have been legal, the contribution itself, but the way the money was earned was illegal."" Did Browder's associates send $400 million to Hillary Clinton's campaign? No. We found $17,700 donated to Clinton and another $297,000 to the Democratic National Committee. The Russians say that Browder and his partners at Ziff Brothers Investments, a New York venture capital firm, illegally syphoned billions of rubles out of the country. To add salt to the wound, Browder had led the charge to pass the 2012 Magnitsky Act, a law that penalizes Russian officials suspected of sanctioning the death of Browder’s lawyer Sergei Magnitsky in a Russian prison. The Ziff brothers came up during the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and others, and Natalia V. Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer who promised dirt on the Hillary Clinton campaign. According to transcripts from Senate Judiciary Committee interviews, Veselnitskaya’s materials described the Ziffs as Democratic donors, although Trump’s son said they gave both to Democrats and Republicans. We reached out to the Russian Embassy and the Russian consulate in Washington to get details on the $400 million donation and had not heard back in time for our deadline. Given that Veselnitskaya tied Browder and the Ziff brothers together, we researched their political donations. Browder became a British citizen and can’t legally contribute to U.S. candidates. Ziff Brothers Investments through its executives can give freely, and they have. Before we get into their political contributions, we also wondered if Putin could have been talking about money that went to the Clinton Foundation. In past years, Browder and Ziff Brothers Investments had given to the Clinton Global Initiative, a project of the Clinton Foundation, but the total was not more than $110,000, records show. In the 2016 election cycle, Ziff Brothers Investments gave $1.7 million. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, nearly two-thirds, or about $1.1 million, went to Democratic committees, and the rest to Republicans. The center listed the firm’s top recipients: Recipient Amount DNC Services Corp $296,966 Senate Majority PAC $250,000 Defending Main Street $200,000 Democratic Senatorial Campaign Cmte $40,000 Democratic State Central Cmte/Louisiana $35,412 National Republican Congressional Cmte $32,400 Democratic Party of Montana $28,622 Democratic Executive Cmte of Florida $27,287 Democratic Party of New Hampshire $27,287 Democratic Party of Virginia $27,287 Democratic Party of Wisconsin $27,287 Georgia Federal Elections Cmte $27,287 Federal law puts tighter limits on contributions to individual candidates. Here, the Ziffs mainly put their money into incumbents, and Republicans did better by a margin of about $145,000 to $46,000. Clinton’s campaign received $17,700. Unless Putin had other Browder associates in mind, his figure of $400 million going to the Clinton campaign is a massive exaggeration. Between the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee, the Ziffs gave about $315,000. The Clinton campaign raised $563 million overall, so Putin's sum would account for nearly three-fourths of all donations. (PACs affiliated with Clinton's campaign raised an additional $231 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.) Putin said associates of Bill Browder gave $400 million to the Clinton campaign. The associates appear to be the Ziff brothers. According to public data, Ziff Brothers Investments gave about $315,000 to Clinton and the Democratic National Committee. Overall, the firm gave about $1.1 million to Democratic committees around the country.

Vladimir Putin falsely claims Russia never interfered in American politics
","Russian President Vladimir Putin claimed Russia has never interfered in American politics during a joint press conference with President Donald Trump, despite all evidence to the contrary. Putin’s assertion came on July 16, just days after Special Counsel Robert Mueller indicted a dozen Russian intelligence officials for meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. ""The Russian state has never interfered and is not going to interfere into internal American affairs including election process,"" Putin said following a one-on-one meeting with Trump in Helsinki, Finland. Trump, for his part, appeared to take his Russian counterpart at his word. ""President Putin says it's not Russia,"" Trump said. ""I don't see any reason why it would be."" But the U.S. intelligence community, House and Senate panels led by Republicans, the special counsel’s team and members of Trump’s own administration have endorsed the view that Russia has interfered in American politics, in a practice that dates as far back as the Soviet era.  As we wrote in our story naming the 2017 Lie of the Year — Trump’s claim that Russian election interference is a ""made-up story"" — a mountain of evidence points to the fact that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. In a January 2017 assessment, the CIA, FBI, NSA and Director of National Intelligence — referred to as the the intelligence community — concluded that Russia intervened to help Trump’s election chances while hurting those of Hillary Clinton. Intelligence agencies have said the Kremlin directed the cyber-theft of private data, the placement of propaganda against particular candidates, and an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process. A Senate panel that independently reviewed the intelligence community’s assessment backed up its findings, concluding July 3 that the agencies’ joint assessment was a ""sound intelligence product."" The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence also said Russia conducted cyberattacks on U.S. political institutions during the 2016 campaign. Fresh evidence of Moscow’s election interference emerged in indictments stemming from the special counsel’s investigation. On July 13, Mueller charged 12 Russian intelligence officers for their role in the hacking of the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the Clinton campaign, and subsequently leaking stolen emails and documents. In this latest indictment, the special counsel alleged that units operating under Moscow’s military intelligence agency conducted cyber operations that involved ""the staged releases of documents"" obtained through targeted computer hacking. ""These units conducted large-scale cyber operations to interfere with the 2016 U.S. presidential election,"" the indictment states. Previously, the special counsel charged 13 Russians and three Russian entities with conspiring to defraud the United States and interfere with the 2016 presidential election. Members of Trump’s own administration have endorsed a view at odds with the president. Then-CIA director Mike Pompeo — now secretary of state — said in November 2017 that he stands by the intelligence community’s January 2017 findings that Russian cyber-meddling sought to help Trump and hurt Clinton. Following Mueller’s first indictment against Russian hackers in February, Trump’s then-national security adviser H.R. McMaster called the evidence of Russia’s interference in the 2016 presidential election ""incontrovertible."" Dan Coats, Trump’s top intelligence official, told lawmakers in February, ""There should be no doubt that (Putin) views the past effort as successful."" Coats, the director of National Intelligence, also issued a stern warning days before Trump’s meeting with Putin in Helsinki. He compared the current threat of more Russian cyberattacks to warning signs before the September 11 attacks that killed nearly 3,000. ""It was in the months prior to September 2001 when, according to then-CIA Director George Tenet, the system is blinking red,"" Coats said. ""And here we are nearly two decades later, and I'm here to say, the warning lights are blinking red again."" In light of Putin’s blanket denial, we took a fresh look at Russia’s election-meddling past. Historians said the 2016 election was the first known example of a Russian attempt to sway a U.S. election in favor of a specific candidate, though there could have been additional attempts that remain classified or undiscovered. ""If by ‘Russia’ one means post-1991 Russia, that statement (from Putin) appears to be correct based on publicly available information,"" said Lucan Way, a University of Toronto professor specializing in democratization and authoritarianism in the former Soviet Union. But that does not mean the 2016 meddling was unprecedented. Way noted that Russia has frequently interfered in the elections of post-Soviet countries since the fall of the Soviet Union. Further, the Soviet Union worked in secret to help or hurt U.S. candidates at least four times during the Cold War era. ""What we are seeing with Russia's active measures today are ‘unprecedented’ in that they use new tools and technologies … but the ends are very much older, and are straight from the KGB playbook,"" said Calder Walton, an expert in intelligence history and international relations at Harvard University’s Kennedy School of Government. ""One can't understand Russian active measures to interfere in the 2016 election without understanding the long KGB history."" In 1960, for example, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev offered Adlai Stevenson assistance from a secret propaganda campaign. Stevenson declined the offer and ultimately lost in the Democratic primary to John F. Kennedy. In 1968, Anatoly Dobrynin, the Soviet ambassador to the United States, offered to secretly fund for Hubert Humphrey’s campaign against Richard Nixon, but Humphrey rejected the bribe. In 1976, the KGB opened a smear campaign against anti-communist Democrat Henry ""Scoop"" Jackson, forging FBI paperwork to make it seem that Jackson was gay and distributing the fake reports to U.S. newspapers both during and after the election. But Walton said Soviet interference efforts became most active in the 1980s against Ronald Reagan, pointing to a now-public cache of top-secret KGB records called the Mitrokhin Archive. The KGB sought compromising material on Reagan in 1976 and planted some anti-Reagan articles in foreign newspapers. Ahead of the 1984 election, the KGB also worked to discredit Reagan’s policies and popularize the slogan ""Reagan Means War"" around the world. ""There is a long history of the Kremlin interfering in internal U.S. affairs, including elections,"" Walton said. ""This included gathering compromising material on U.S. politicians, supporting Kremlin-favored candidates in U.S. elections, spreading forgeries and disinformation campaigns to inculcate distrust among the U.S. population in their government and Western allies."" Walton added that Putin’s claim is ""nonsense."" We've reached out to the Russian embassy and will update the fact-check if we hear back. Putin said, ""The Russian state has never interfered ... into internal American affairs including election process."" A mountain of evidence testifies to the fact that Russia meddled in the 2016 U.S. presidential election. The U.S. intelligence community and a Republican-led Senate panel concluded independently of each other that Kremlin-directed operatives stole private data, used propaganda against particular candidates, and engaged in an overall effort to undermine public faith in the U.S. democratic process. A Republican-led House panel found in its own investigation that Russia conducted cyberattacks during the 2016 campaign. These findings are supported by indictments stemming from the special counsel’s investigation.  There is no public evidence to suggest that the post-Cold War Russian government had previously interfered in a U.S. election at levels near the 2016 meddling, but the Soviet Union made several attempts to do so prior to its collapse in 1991.

","Fortunately for everyone in New York City, a story about giant rats eating humans is a hoax. A story on sciencearticle.website said four homeless men were eaten alive, a gruesome narrative accompanied by photos of large rats held by sanitation workers and lying on a table. The warnings of 40-pound rats gnawing on unconscious humans isn’t true. This story was flagged as part Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) When we asked the city about it, a health department spokeswoman Carolina Rodriguez said, ""The only giant mutant rat in New York City is Master Splinter, and we all know he is partial to pizza just like another famous New York City rat.""  She explained that most rats in the city are Norway rats, which grow between 12 to 18 inches, with 5- to 6-inch tails. At most, they weigh about a pound. According to Rodriguez, the health department has not received any reports of rat attacks. This article also includes three pictures, all of which are gross. The first picture shows seven huge rats, laying dead on a table. When reverse-image searched, this photograph can be traced back to a National Geographic photo gallery on giant swamp rats. Also known as nutrias, these rodents weigh about 17 pounds and have been introduced to coastal regions in the United States. In Louisiana, they’ve become so prevalent that the government will pay hunters $5 per kill in an attempt to prevent overgrazing. These rodents do not live in New York, and they are unlikely to ever make the move. A 2014 study shows that nutrias prefer warmer climates, where only a few days per year are lower than 24 degrees Fahrenheit. New York’s sewer systems certainly don’t fit the bill. The image is reposted a second time within the article, although this time altered to make it appear that it was broadcast on the news. A breaking news runner gives the image an authentic look, but the fake ""5 NEWS"" logo and the ""smhwtfnews.com"" link make it clear that the screenshot was fabricated. The third image, in which a man in a green shirt appears to be holding a giant rat, is an old internet hoax. Reverse-image searches reveal that the man is demonstrating forced perspective: the rat isn’t bigger, it’s just closer to the camera. An accompanying image, which was omitted from the giant rat article, shows the same man and the same rat, but in the proper perspective. Both the giant swamp rat and the forced perspective images have been shared widely across fake news sites to ""prove"" that giant rats were caught in London, Hong Kong, and other urban areas across the world.

Bernie Sanders' claim that Brett Kavanaugh defies Supreme Court precedent a stretch
","After President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh for the U.S. Supreme Court, Democrats highlighted bits of his paper trail on the D.C. Court of Appeals to galvanize opposition. Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., called out Kavanaugh’s generous interpretation of the powers granted to the president by the Constitution. ""Brett Kavanaugh, contrary to 200 years of Supreme Court precedent, believes a president ‘may decline to enforce a statute … when the president deems the statute unconstitutional,’ "" Sanders wrote in a Facebook post. Sanders has a point about what Kavanaugh thinks about the president’s enforcement of statutes, but he’s very wrong when he suggests Kavanaugh’s opinion is at odds with 200 years of Supreme Court precedent. Sanders’ team pointed us to what Kavanaugh wrote in an opinion on Seven-Sky vs. Holder, a 2011 D.C. circuit case that challenged the individual mandate of the Affordable Care Act. In his dissent, Kavanaugh wrote: ""Under the Constitution, the president may decline to enforce a statute that regulates private individuals when the president deems the statute unconstitutional, even if a court has held or would hold the statute constitutional."" Kavanaugh’s remark was a footnote explaining why the court shouldn’t have been considering the case, given that the president might not even enforce the individual mandate. He was citing Justice Antonin Scalia, who made a similar argument in a 2011 concurring opinion. The implication of Kavanaugh’s opinion was that a president could supersede the court’s authority on a question of unconstitutionality. ""Kavanaugh makes a strong version of the claim, and it’s probably a minority position among professors, but it’s never been definitively settled by the Supreme Court,"" said Kermit Roosevelt, constitutional law professor at Penn Law School. Experts generally agree that a president is not bound by a lower court’s decision when deciding a law is unconstitutional but diverge on whether the Supreme Court has the final say. However, the Supreme Court has never dealt with this exact question, according to Mark Tushnet, a law professor at Harvard University. Sanders cited Marbury vs. Madison, one of the most famous Supreme Court cases in history, as evidence that the court, not the president, has the final say. The case states that ""it is emphatically the province and the duty of the Judicial Department to say what the law is."" But according to Saikrishna Prakash, professor at University of Virginia School of Law, the decision is ""about whether the court can second-guess Congress. (It can.) It doesn’t say it’s only the duty of the court to decide constitutional questions."" Instead, each branch has a duty to stay faithful to the Constitution, even if it clashes with another branch’s view. ""I will say that there are lots of people who believe the Supreme Court has a special role in constitutional interpretation, and that’s a general view,"" Prakash said. ""There are people like myself who think the court doesn’t have a special role."" The idea that a president may not enforce the law sounds odd, but the legal experts we talked to said it was common. ""As a practical matter, there is little doubt that the president sets law enforcement priorities, and that some laws will be vigorously enforced and others will not,"" said Sarah Duggin, a professor at the Columbus School of Law. ""It is also true that at various times in our history, presidents have declined to enforce laws they deemed unconstitutional."" The practice of declining to enforce a law because they find it unconstitutional dates back to the Founding Fathers, and has been done by at least the past six administrations, Prakash said. When President Thomas Jefferson came into office, he refused to enforce the Sedition Act passed by President John Adams on the basis that it was unconstitutional and pardoned those serving sentences. The issue did not go to court. In signing the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, President George W. Bush declined to enforce on constitutional grounds a provision mandating that passports display Israel as the place of birth for those born in Jerusalem. When the issue went to the Supreme Court, the court sided with the president. When signing the National Defense Authorization Act for 2016, Obama wrote that in the event restrictions on the transfer of Guantanamo detainees violated the Constitution, his administration would implement the law in a ""manner that avoids the constitutional conflict."" Sanders said Kavanaugh’s belief that a president ""may decline to enforce a statute . . . when the president deems the statute unconstitutional"" is ""contrary to 200 years of Supreme Court precedent."" In practical terms, presidents have indeed declined to enforce statutes they deemed unconstitutional. The question has never come before the court, however. Marbury vs. Madison held that the Supreme Court could declare statutes unconstitutional, but did not deny that presidents could also enforce constitutional principles.  We rate this statement Mostly False.",/factchecks/2018/jul/16/bernie-sanders/brett-kavanaugh-supreme-court-president-power/

The post, which is on the website World Facts FTW, claims that NASA wants volunteers to participate in ""bed rest studies,"" as it wants to ""study how the body reacts to extended periods of rest for astronauts who are going on extended periods of space travel."" As a reward for making it through 60 days of staying in bed and enduring bone, muscle and heart tests, volunteers get a large amount of cash, the post claims. We wanted to know if this stellar offer was truly up for grabs. We found out that NASA has paid people to stay in bed for long periods of time before.

We found no evidence to support the claim that NASA paid, or will pay, its volunteers $100,000. The blog post’s headline is also misleading, since it doesn’t consider how difficult it is to participate in a bed rest study, given the high number of applicants and low number of participants required. In the Vice article, Iwanicki reports that he was one of 55 participants selected out of 25,000 applicants. Given that NASA’s bed studies occur infrequently—the previous one concluded in November 2017 and the next one will start in fall 2018—it seems likely that they would need a small number of volunteers.   A Lexis search did not return any results of NASA paying people $100,000 to participate in a bed rest study, and NASA could not be reached for comment.

"['Jobs', 'Illinois', 'Juliana Stratton']","
Was Rauner’s first term a dry spell for jobs? No.
","Illinois employment figures hit a high point last summer, finally surpassing the state’s previous jobs peak reached nearly two decades ago in an economy fueled by the dot.com boom. Yet according to the Democratic running mate of governor candidate J.B. Pritzker, the state has gone years without creating jobs under Gov. Bruce Rauner, the Republican that the Pritzker ticket is seeking to oust. ""We really have to look at ways all across this state to make sure that we are creating jobs, something that the current governor has not done at all in the three and a half years that he’s been governor,"" Juliana Stratton, Pritzker’s pick for lieutenant governor, recently told radio host Tom Miller on WJPF-AM near Carbondale in Southern Illinois. Stratton, a state representative from Chicago, doubled down on her claim a few minutes later. ""What we see is that he’s created no jobs over the past three years,"" she added. But federal jobs data show Illinois employment gains in 2015, 2016, 2017 and on into this year — the period coinciding with Rauner’s time in office so far. Given the numbers, how then can Stratton claim there’s been no jobs growth under Rauner? When we put that question to the Pritzker campaign, spokesman Jason Rubin responded with a statement that, in a backhanded way, refuted his own candidate’s puzzler. ""Bruce Rauner called his predecessor a ‘massive failure’ on jobs and then led Illinois to a significantly lower rate of job growth during his time in office,"" Rubin wrote, referring to attacks Rauner leveled in 2014 against then-Democratic Gov. Patrick Quinn. ""Job growth in the first three years of Bruce Rauner’s administration was an abysmal 2.79 percent, nearly half the national average, and lower than many neighboring states,"" Rubin wrote. Cutting through the partisan fog, Rubin acknowledged employment is up under Rauner even while stressing growth has not been as robust as the national average. But Stratton said there had been no growth, period. Preliminary federal data for May show more than 6.1 million Illinois residents holding non-farm jobs, up 188,000 from the month before Rauner took office in January 2015. Loading... Rubin is correct the rate of job growth has lagged the national average under Rauner, but it also did so in most years under Quinn as well as governors of both parties before him dating back to the early 1990s, federal data show. As for how Illinois measured up to its neighbors over Rauner’s first three years in office, the state has indeed fallen behind Wisconsin, Missouri and Indiana. But it trailed Wisconsin, Indiana, Iowa and Kentucky in the last three years of Quinn’s term, according to federal figures. It’s also beside the point. Stratton didn’t talk about growth rates. She asserted there has been no growth under Rauner, which simply isn’t true. Political fun with jobs numbers aside, the red herrings tossed by the Pritzker campaign raise a broader question: Can a governor really take blame or credit for the trajectory of state employment figures? Indeed, Rauner himself has boasted in the past about jobs created on his watch. Richard Auxier, a research associate with the Washington D.C.-based Urban Institute, said it would be hard to pin Illinois’ employment trajectory on any single governor. A state economy, Auxier explained, is like a large ship: ""You can’t just take the wheel of a ship and turn it at a 90-degree angle."" That’s why, Auxier said, employment swings — beholden as they are to national economic shifts and a state’s long-term trends — generally shouldn’t be either ""applauded or pinned"" on the governor who happens to hold office when one occurs. Stratton said Rauner has ""created no jobs over the past three years."" But federal employment data indicate jobs have increased by 188,000 since Rauner took office. Even the response from the Pritzker/Stratton campaign, which knocked the employment growth rate under Rauner for falling short of his predecessor’s, tacitly acknowledged that job growth had occurred. More to the point, however, Stratton didn’t comment on the state’s employment growth rate during the interview. Instead, her remarks called into question whether any jobs were created under Rauner.

George Soros not headed to jail over campaign contributions
","Billionaire George Soros has made his final donation, according to some conservative bloggers. A May article in Right Wing News says that nearly $2 billion of his money was ""intercepted"" and that the investor could go to jail for years. This article, which has been shared over 5,000 times on Facebook, is not true. This story was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Soros is a hedge fund manager and philanthropist. He has donated $18 billion to his philanthropic organization, Open Society Foundations, for initiatives to support universities, promote democracy, and reduce poverty. He also regularly donates to Democratic campaigns in the United States. Lately, Soros has focused on changing the justice system by donating to local district attorney candidates who pledge to act tougher on police brutality cases and be more aware of racial issues in policing. The Right Wing News post frames this as the grounds for Soros’s arrest. But who intercepted the money? What was the crime? We decided to investigate. The headline of this article, which states that the money was intercepted and that Soros could be headed to jail, is widely unsupported by evidence. It is also unsupported by the article itself, which never explains or even mentions legal action being brought against Soros. Instead, the article on Right Wing News focuses on Soros’s involvement in district attorney elections in California. The author cites entire paragraphs from Fox News and the Los Angeles Times, two outlets that have reported on Soros’s election donations. Neither mention any legal action, and a Nexis search did not find any other articles about about arresting Soros. This part of the headline appears to be entirely false, and merely meant to entice readers to click. It is true that Soros and other liberal groups have donated huge sums of money to candidates who want to crack down on police brutality. However, a Los Angeles Times graphic shows that Soros donated about $19 million to 21 prosecutor campaigns across the country since 2014. In California, he has spent $2.7 million. This is a far cry from $1.8 billion spent on four campaigns in California, as Right Wing News claimed. The headline’s claim that this money was intercepted by someone was also unsupported by the body of the post and any other sources. Right Wing News repurposed existing news articles about district attorney elections in California to make it appear that George Soros had donated 100 times more money than he had. The website then headlined this article with two baseless claims: that Soros’s donations had been intercepted, and that he was likely to go to prison. Soros is not in legal trouble for his donations to district attorney campaigns, has only donated $2.7 million in California, and none of his money was intercepted by a third party. Due to a completely fabricated headline and incorrect numbers, we rate this claim Pants on Fire! UPDATE (July 16, 2018): After we published our fact-check, Right Wing News contacted us to say that the story was an opinion piece and that the headline included an error. Right Wing News adjusted the headline to say, ""OPINION: $1.8 Million Of Soros’ Money Just Intercepted – He Should Officially Go To Prison For Years."" ",/factchecks/2018/jul/13/blog-posting/soros-not-headed-jail/

Greg Abbott says Houston is home to more brothels than Starbucks stores
","Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, seeking re-election, responded to a supporter’s question about campaign messaging by talking about sexual exploitation and a ubiquitous brand of coffee shops. ""In Houston, Texas, there are more brothels than there are Starbucks,"" Abbott said during a June 27, 2018, fundraising conference call with supporters, according to a recap by Austin American-Statesman commentator Ken Herman. We wondered if Abbott's claim holds up by the numbers. A Children at Risk statement Abbott’s campaign, responding to Herman, said the comparison originated with Robert Sanborn, president and CEO of the Houston-based nonprofit Children at Risk. In January 2018, Sanborn was quoted telling the Houston Chronicle for a news story: ""We have more brothels than we have Starbucks in our city."" A brothel is a building where prostitutes are available. Houston’s illicit sex business, the Chronicle story said, ""includes top-dollar call girl agencies, legions of street walkers, hundreds of massage parlors fronting for sex shops and cantinas where a beer can be followed by a ‘date’ in a room behind the bar."" RubMaps website Sanborn told the newspaper there were over 400 storefront sex businesses operating in Houston--an estimate Children at Risk traced to posts on Rubmaps.com, ""where patrons rate and review illicit massage proprietors,"" the story said. Alfred T. Tribble Jr., an FBI supervisor who oversees the human trafficking unit in Houston, told the paper: ""Houston is fertile ground for trafficking because of its proximity to the border, its sexually oriented businesses, its diversity and the demand for sexual services."" Seeking elaboration on the brothel count, we reached Jamey Caruthers, an attorney for Children at Risk, who pointed us to the group’s April 2018 report stating that statewide by the group’s analysis, over 35,000 children were attending 55 schools within 1,000 feet of a suspected illegal massage business, which the report describes as fronts for human trafficking and sexual exploitation. ""The women trapped in these places are made to provide sexual services to as many as ten men a day through force, fraud and coercion,"" the report says. As of April 5, 2018, the report says, the group identified 689 suspected illegal massage businesses in Texas which the report says were listed on the RubMaps site as open; not labeled by users as ""non-erotic;"" and that had at least one customer review. By this sift, the report says, Harris County, home to Houston, had the largest concentration, with 259, followed by Dallas (97), Bexar (69), Collin (53) and Tarrant (52) counties. In July 2018, Caruthers told us by email that suspected sites in Houston alone were counted if RubMaps showed the businesses having Houston street addresses. Caruthers said the Houston-specific count of such businesses has been around 200 since December 2017. ""Today it is at 221 (these numbers fluctuate based on new locations opening, closures, and Rubmap’s own internal changes which we are not privy to. Also, savvy owners will go on the site and mark their business as ‘closed’ in order to avoid scrutiny by law enforcement),"" Caruthers wrote. We turned to the RubMaps site, which headlines its first page: ""Where Fantasy Meets Reality."" Text on that page says RubMaps’ unverified entries showing the location of each business, photos and reviews are entirely user-generated. ""Therefore, it is unknown whether these locations are accurate, if the pictures actually depict the locations, or if the reviews are factual,"" RubMaps says. Next, we clicked to a search page and fetched a list of 576 Houston massage parlors which we winnowed to 224 businesses by specifying that ""kissing"" be available. That was enough searching for the Truth-O-Meter’s purposes. Houston police estimate Separately, we reached James Dale of the Houston Police Department’s vice division who said by phone and email that the department identifies brothels by focusing on massage parlors, sometimes based on calls from neighbors. Dale also said the department partners with Children at Risk in battling brothels. Dale said reports filed by police investigators covering October 2015 into July 2018 indicate the city is home to some 274 ""nuisance locations"" including apartment buildings and 214 ""known"" massage parlors. Police have pressed prostitution-related cases involving 47 of the parlors, Dale said. Starbucks stores in the Bayou City Caruthers told us that at the time of its report, Children at Risk employed the online Starbucks Store Locator and an enthusiast’s website, starbuckseverywhere.net, to ascertain there were 98 Starbucks stores in Houston. For our part, we counted 51 Houston stores by using the Starbucks locator website yet close to 100 Houston stores specified on the enthusiast’s site. We emailed Starbucks without drawing a reply about its Houston stores. Meantime, the Starbucks enthusiast, who told us his full name is Winter, responded by email that as of June 5, 2018, he’d confirmed 155 Starbucks stores in Houston--93 owned by the company and 62 licensed to other vendors. We asked Dale, of Houston’s police department, if it could be that Starbucks stores in Houston outnumber local brothels. ""There are a lot of massage parlors out there. They open up all the time. We do our best to look into them,"" Dale replied. ""I don’t want to say there are more massage parlors or more Starbucks right now. The numbers (of massage parlors) fluctuate greatly,"" Dale said. Our ruling Abbott said Houston has more brothels than Starbucks stores. Of late, Houston police have tied prostitution-related cases to less than 50 sites while Houston is home to 155 Starbucks stores. However, police have identified more than 200 massage parlors and other places where prostitution likely occurs--a count supported by our own search of Houston parlors listed on the Rubmaps site.

Did Patrick Morrisey's family firm lobby against Gorsuch confirmation?
","In West Virginia’s closely watched Senate race, the state Democratic Party is shining a spotlight on Republican Attorney General Patrick Morrisey’s wife, Denise, who is a Washington lobbyist. In a tweet on July 10, a few days after President Donald Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the high court, the state party referenced the role of Denise Morrisey’s firm in the previous Supreme Court nomination battle, involving the nomination of Trump nominee Neil Gorsuch. Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging incumbent Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, had publicly expressed support for Gorsuch’s confirmation. The state Democratic Party party tweeted, ""U.S. Senate candidate @MorriseyWV CAN’T have his CAKE & EAT it too! FACT: His family’s firm was paid $500,000 to lobby AGAINST Trump’s last Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch."" U.S. Senate candidate @MorriseyWV CAN’T have his CAKE & EAT it too! FACT: His family’s firm was paid $500,000 to lobby AGAINST Trump’s last Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. pic.twitter.com/U58E8OO0lK This isn’t the first time Denise Morrisey’s employer has caused friction for Patrick Morrisey. We have previously written about lobbying that her firm, Capitol Counsel, did for major pharmaceutical companies, some of which produce or distribute opioids — a category of drug that has caused severe problems in West Virginia and elsewhere. As for Capitol Counsel’s work against Gorsuch’s nomination, we found some truth in the West Virginia Democratic Party’s allegation, but also some significant overreaches. Not really. The party backs up its claim that ""the Morrisey family owns the Washington, D.C. lobbying firm Capitol Counsel"" by citing a Gazette-Mail article from May 2017. That article said that Denise Morrisey holds ""the second-largest ownership stake"" in the firm. The firm partly confirmed and partly contradicted that account in a July 2017 letter outlining the scope and limits of the firm’s connections to the Morriseys. In the letter, the firm’s founder, John Rafaelli, said Denise Morrisey has an ownership stake, but a smaller one than the newspaper had reported. ""She is a minority shareholder with 15 percent of the stock,"" Rafaelli wrote. Regardless of the exact amount of ownership, the Democratic Party’s assertion is overly expansive. Just because Denise Morrisey is a part-owner of Capitol Counsel doesn’t make it the Morriseys’ family firm. She doesn’t own a majority stake, and her husband is not involved in its operations. Yes. According to federal lobbying disclosure forms, Capitol Counsel lobbied on behalf of Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc., including for a time on ""legislative issues related to the nomination of Judge Neil Gorsuch to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States."" We should note that Denise Morrisey did not personally lobby against Gorsuch. Her name was absent from the firm’s disclosure forms for Planned Parenthood. This is consistent with Rafaelli’s statement in the letter that a lobbyist from the firm who recuses from a particular client will not be listed on that client’s disclosure form. No, it was paid substantially less. The party cited a May 2017 article in the Washington Examiner that said in part that ""the lobbying shop has cashed Planned Parenthood checks worth $460,000."" But the party twists this figure by saying that all paid for the anti-Gorsuch lobbying. Disclosure forms show that, in all, Planned Parenthood has paid Capitol Counsel $710,000 to date. Their relationship began in the first quarter of 2015, and the most recent filing covered the first quarter of 2018. But the only two quarters that overlapped with Gorsuch’s nomination were the first two quarters of 2017, and during that period, Planned Parenthood paid the firm $120,000, which is much lower than what the tweet said. (Gorsuch lobbying was listed as an issue on the third quarter 2017 form as well, but that is likely an oversight since he was already sitting on the court by then.) It’s also an exaggeration to say that the firm spent all of its lobbying efforts during those two quarters on Gorsuch’s nomination. The firm listed a number of other issues on its disclosure form, specifically ""health care issues related to HR 1628, the American Health Care Act of 2017; legislative issues related to Title X family planning funding, including HJRes 43, a Resolution of Disapproval of a rule submitted by the Department of Health and Human Services relating to Title X project recipients."" For the record, the firm insists that, despite her ownership stake, Denise Morrisey did not benefit personally from Planned Parenthood payments to the firm. In the letter, Rafaelli wrote that ""Mrs. Morrisey’s compensation is based 100 percent on the revenue generated by clients that she is listed as working on behalf of on the (disclosure forms)."" Morrisey's current clients include the American Academy of Dermatology, the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the Biotechnology Industry Organization, the California Dental Association, the Healthcare Leadership Council, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations, the National Society of Genetic Counselors, Physician Hospitals of America, the Physicians Advocacy Institute, and Varian Medical Systems. The West Virginia Democratic Party tweeted that Morrisey’s ""family’s firm was paid $500,000 to lobby AGAINST Trump’s last Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch."" The firm Denise Morrisey worked for did lobby for Planned Parenthood against Gorsuch’s confirmation. However, the tweet exaggerates key aspects of the relationship. Capitol Counsel is affiliated with Denise Morrisey but not the family as a whole, and the firm was not paid nearly as much as the $500,000 the tweet alleged.

GOP U.S. Senate hopeful Leah Vukmir's Pants on Fire claim about Mark Pocan proposal to abolish ICE
","Would a Wisconsin congressman’s proposal to eliminate ICE really mean no more enforcement of the U.S. borders? No. But that’s the claim by Leah Vukmir, who is running for the U.S. Senate seat held by Wisconsin Democrat Tammy Baldwin. Here’s why Vukmir’s blanket statement goes way wrong. Like us on Facebook. Follow us on Twitter: @PolitiFactWisc. Pocan’s proposal On June 25, 2018, U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, a Madison-area Democrat, announced his proposal to eliminate the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). That was five days after President Donald Trump signed an executive order ending the separation of families who were trying to enter the United States illegally at the Mexican border. To be clear, ICE was not involved in those border actions, which resulted in the separation of more than 2,300 children and their parents. Pocan instead alluded to ICE actions taken inside the United States, accusing a unit of the agency of ""hunting down and tearing apart families"" at churches and schools, and raiding places such as garden centers and meatpacking plants. His proposal drew the wrath of Vukmir, who faces Kevin Nicholson in the Aug. 14, 2018, Republican primary for the Senate. The winner will take on Baldwin on Nov. 6, 2018. In a news release on July 5, 2018, Vukmir raised the prospect of open borders, saying Pocan’s proposal would be ""effectively eliminating our border"" She added: ""Sen. Baldwin, where do you stand? Do you believe we should eliminate border enforcement? Americans deserve to know."" (Baldwin doesn’t support Pocan’s proposal, which was introduced as legislation on July 12, 2018. In an odd twist, Pocan and other Democrats who introduced the measure said the same day that if GOP leadership follows through with their vow to bring it to the House floor, they would vote against it. ""We know"" Speaker Paul Ryan ""is not serious about passing our"" bill, the Democrats declared in a statement, saying they ""will not engage in this political stunt."" So, Vukmir is claiming that Pocan’s proposal to eliminate ICE would ""eliminate border enforcement""  — a broad statement essentially echoed later by her campaign spokeswoman. But Pocan isn’t proposing to get rid of border enforcement  — and ICE isn’t the agency that patrols the borders, anyway. What is ICE? Many Americans might associate ICE with border enforcement. But as University of Texas professor and immigration expert Ruth Ellen Wasem put it, ""most do not know that ICE’s role in immigration enforcement is not at the border."" Border security is actually the responsibility of another federal agency  — Customs and Border Protection. CBP is the parent agency for the Border Patrol, which patrols the U.S. borders with Mexico and Canada. It is the Border Patrol that did the recent separation of parents from children at the Mexican border. Elizabeth Cohen, a Syracuse University political science professor and immigration expert, told us: Customs and Border Protection is responsible for enforcement at the border and 100 miles in from any point on the border of the U.S., land and water. Eliminating ICE would not eliminate CBP or enforcement at the border. What ICE does is arrest, detain and deport unauthorized immigrants who are already inside the United States. This focus on the interior of the country is made clear on the ICE website: While certain responsibilities and close cooperation with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services and others require significant ICE assets near the border, the majority of immigration enforcement work for ICE takes place in the country’s interior. For example, in what The Atlantic described as two of ICE’s largest raids, both in Ohio in June 2018, the agency arrested 146 employees at a meat-processing plant and detained 114 workers at a nursery for suspected immigration violations. Not abandoning enforcement Indeed, Pocan has been clear that he is not proposing to end border enforcement. In a USA Today opinion column published two days before Vukmir made her claim, he wrote: Abolishing ICE does not mean open borders. ICE is the agency directed by the president to aggressively round up and detain individuals already living in our country, not the agency tasked with patrolling the border. Under my legislation, we would still have agents stationed to secure the border.

FactCheck.org found that Pocan, as well as all other Democrats in Congress who are calling for the end of ICE, have not called for abandoning border enforcement. See all of our fact checks in the Wisconsin U.S. Senate race. Steven Camarota, research director at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for low levels of immigration, argued that eliminating ICE would hamper immigration enforcement. He told us that while some people entering the United States illegally are immediately returned to Mexico, those detained for any length of time are placed in the custody of ICE. So, eliminating ICE would result in a ""catch and release policy,"" he said. But Stephen Legomsky, a Washington University law professor emeritus and immigration expert, told us that CBP or any agency that replaces ICE could take on the detention function. As for Vukmir, when we asked her campaign for information to support her statement, spokesman Mattias Gugel sent us a link to an animation that shows how to do a Google search. Amusing, perhaps, but it didn’t help his boss. Our rating Vukmir says Pocan’s proposal to eliminate ICE would ""eliminate border enforcement."" But enforcing the border is not even ICE’s job. Rather, the federal agency pursues unauthorized immigrants who are already inside the country. A different federal agency is responsible for patrolling the border, so border enforcement would continue even if ICE were eliminated. And, in any case, Pocan is not proposing to end border enforcement. 
For a statement that is false and ridiculous, we rate Vukmir’s claim Pants on Fire.",/factchecks/2018/jul/13/leah-vukmir/gop-us-senate-hopeful-leah-vukmirs-pants-fire-clai/
