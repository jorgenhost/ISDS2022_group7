At DNC, Sen. Chris Murphy says 90% of Americans want expanded background checks for gun purchases
","Democrats made a forceful argument for stricter gun control on the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. One speaker, Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, called for expanded background checks in particular. ""Listen, 90 percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales so that dangerous weapons don't fall into the wrong hands,"" Murphy said. Under current law, background checks are required in sales by federally licensed gun dealers, but the checks are not required for gun sales by private sellers. National polls conducted over the past year consistently show that around 90 percent of Americans support some sort of expanded background checks for gun purchases. Here are a few examples of recent polls about background checks: Quinnipiac University poll, conducted June 21-27, 2016: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Not sure: 1 percent. CNN/ORC poll, conducted June 16-19, 2016: Would you favor or oppose ""a background check on anyone attempting to purchase a gun in order to determine whether the prospective buyer has been convicted of a felony""? Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 8 percent. CBS News poll, conducted June 13-14, 2016: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 89 percent. Oppose: 8 percent. Unsure/no answer: 2 percent. Public Policy Polling survey, conducted March 24-26, 2016: ""Do you support or oppose requiring a criminal background check of every person who wants to buy a firearm?"" Support: 84 percent. Oppose: 10 percent. Not sure: 6 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Dec. 16-20, 2015: ""Would you support or oppose a law requiring background checks on people buying guns at gun shows or online?"" Support: 89 percent. Oppose: 9 percent. Unsure/no answer: 1 percent. CBS/New York Times poll, conducted Oct. 21-25, 2015: ""Do you favor or oppose a federal law requiring background checks on all potential gun buyers?"" Favor: 92 percent. Oppose: 7 percent. Unsure/no answer: 1 percent. Gallup poll, conducted Oct. 7-11, 2015: ""Would you favor or oppose a law which would require universal background checks for all gun purchases in the U.S. using a centralized database across all 50 states?"" Favor: 86 percent. Oppose: 12 percent. Unsure: 2 percent. Quinnipiac University poll, conducted Sept. 17-21, 2015: ""Do you support or oppose requiring background checks for all gun buyers?"" Support: 93 percent. Oppose: 6 percent. Unsure/no answer: 1 percent. Pew Research Center poll, conducted July 14-20, 2015: Do you favor or oppose ""making private gun sales and sales at gun shows subject to background checks?"" Favor: 85 percent. Oppose: 13 percent. Unsure/refused: 2 percent. Pew found that support for background checks spans all partisan and demographic groups, and it is also favored by a majority of households that own guns and those that do not. ""At the collective level, we know that Americans are in favor of the government instituting new checks on the ability to buy guns, which theoretically would prevent those who have some type of official negative record on file from buying them,"" wrote Gallup editor-in-chief Frank Newport in June. ""Americans have mixed feelings as to how effective they think these background check laws would be but overwhelmingly are willing to go along with them."" Some gun rights advocates have taken issue with this statistic for reasons such as the survey questions referring to the general idea of background checks rather than specific legislation. For example, in 2013, polls found that 90 percent of Americans supported expanded background checks. However, when Congress failed to pass a popular bill that would have increased background checks, 47 percent were disappointed or angry that it failed, while some 39 percent were relieved or very happy, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll. This highlights an odd discrepancy: While people overwhelmingly support specific gun policy ideas, like universal background checks and banning suspected terrorists from buying guns, the support is not as robust when it comes to actually expanding gun control. The October CBS/New York Times poll that found 92 percent support for expanded background checks also shows 46 percent of Americans think laws covering gun sales should be either made less strict or stay the same. Just 51 percent said the laws should be made more strict. ""People don't seem to like the idea of ‘gun control,’ but they still want the government to do more to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill,"" said Adam Winkler, a law professor at the University of California Los Angeles and author of Gunfight: The Battle over the Right to Bear Arms in America, in a prior interview with PolitiFact. Our ruling Murphy said, ""90 percent of Americans want our background check system strengthened and expanded to cover more gun sales."" Every national poll we could find that was conducted over the past year supports this statistic. We rate Murphy’s claim True. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/a9c70aeb-a752-48fa-94a9-893e77b835bb",[<zip object at 0x000002809C13C180>],/factchecks/2016/jul/28/chris-murphy/dnc-sen-chris-murphy-says-90-americans-want-expand/

Rear Adm. John Hutson says Donald Trump 'called the military that I served in a disaster'
","On the third night of the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia, retired Rear Adm. John Hutson joined a series of speakers who sought to attack Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on his foreign-policy bona fides. At one point in his speech, Hutson said Trump ""called the military that I served in a disaster."" It’s a barb that Clinton and her surrogates have used frequently against Trump. But how accurate is it? The remark comes from the Republican primary debate sponsored by the Fox Business Network on Jan. 14, 2016. Moderator Maria Bartiromo said, ""Mr. Trump, South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley in her response to the State of the Union address appeared to choose sides within the party, saying Republicans should resist ‘the siren call of the angriest voices.’ She confirmed she was referring to you, among others. Was she out of line? And, how would a President Trump unite the party?"" After saying he felt no ill will towards Haley, Trump said, ""But she did say there was anger. And I could say, oh, I'm not angry. (But) I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger. Our military is a disaster. Our health care is a horror show. Obamacare, we're going to repeal it and replace it. We have no borders. Our vets are being treated horribly. Illegal immigration is beyond belief. Our country is being run by incompetent people. And yes, I am angry. And I won't be angry when we fix it, but until we fix it, I'm very, very angry."" On other occasions, Trump has specifically assailed President Barack Obama’s record -- and, by extension, that of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton -- on military spending, saying the armed forces had been cut too far. For instance, during a visit to Washington in April, Trump said, ""Our active-duty armed forces have shrunk from 2 million in 1991 to about 1.3 million today. The Navy has shrunk from over 500 ships to 272 ships during this same period of time. The Air Force is about one-third smaller than 1991. Pilots flying B-52s in combat missions today. These planes are older than virtually everybody in this room."" (We’ve looked at similar claims here.) However, in the debate exchange with Bartiromo, Trump didn’t specify that he was talking about the military’s budget. Our ruling Trump ""called the military that I served in a disaster."" Trump did say that, almost verbatim. But it’s worth noting that Hutson has described Trump’s words as a personal affront to the institution he devoted his career to, drawing the most unflattering interpretation for a statement that is far less specific. Hutson’s statement is accurate but needs additional information, so we rate it Mostly True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C140100>],/factchecks/2016/jul/28/john-hutson/rear-adm-john-hutson-says-donald-trump-called-mili/

Bill Clinton exaggerates how many people moved out of poverty under his administration
","A video introducing Bill Clinton before the Democratic National Convention showcased the former president’s accomplishments during his terms in office, from 23 million jobs created to a budget surplus to the signing of the Family and Medical Leave Act. ""His actions have changed millions of lives for the better,"" a narrator says. Clinton appears in the video saying, ""We moved 100 times as many people out of poverty as moved out when President (Ronald) Reagan was in office, with 40 percent more jobs."" That ""100 times"" feat sounded familiar. Clinton himself said it before in an October 2014 campaign stop in Milwaukee for Wisconsin gubernatorial candidate Mary Burke. Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton also said it in July 2014 in an interview on PBS’ The Charlie Rose Show. Hillary Clinton’s campaign guided us to reports that used Census poverty data to analyze the statement. If you crunch the numbers from the presidents’ first years to their last full year in office, they support Bill Clinton’s statement. But if you look at the numbers from the year they took office (1993 for Clinton and 1981 for Reagan) to the year they left office, the ratio is a lot smaller. For context: Clinton was elected in 1992 and served from January 1993 to January 2001. Reagan, a Republican elected in 1980, served from January 1981 to January 1989. Poverty changes from first year to last full year in office When Clinton took office in 1993, there were about 39.3 million people in poverty. By his last full year (2000), there were about 31.6 million -- a difference of 7.7 million people. When Reagan stepped into office in 1981, there were about 31.82 million people in poverty, by his last full year (1988), there were about 31.74 million -- a change of 77,000 people. So, using these sets of years, it does show that 100 times as many people moved out of poverty during Clinton’s administration compared to Reagan’s. However, when we calculate for years they took office to the years they left office, the numbers don’t show a ""100 times"" change. For Clinton, about 6.3 million moved out of poverty, for Reagan, 294,000. That’s a difference of about 21 times. While these numbers give us an insight into how many people are living in poverty, economists have told us it’s hard to say how many people actually move out of poverty. Someone who is making just $1 above the poverty threshold may still be struggling and not feel out of poverty. Jobs created The second part of Clinton’s statement says his presidency created 40 percent more jobs than Reagan’s. During Clinton’s tenure, 22.9 million jobs were created, an increase of 21 percent over the eight-year period. When Reagan was president, 16.1 million jobs were created, or an increase of 18 percent over the eight-year period. Overall, then, Clinton’s job-creation total was 42 percent higher than Reagan’s was -- 16.1 million for Reagan vs. 22.9 million for Clinton. It’s important to note that Reagan became president as the country was in a recession, and Clinton took office as the economy was bouncing back. Our ruling On the second night of the Democratic National Convention, Clinton said, ""We moved 100 times as many people out of poverty as moved out when President Reagan was in office, with 40 percent more jobs."" Part of Clinton’s statement (moved 100 times as many out of poverty compared to Reagan) is accurate when analyzed from years presidents took office to last full years in office, but can be incorrect when interpreted from year they took office to the year they left. Also, there was a 40 percent increase in jobs created from Reagan’s terms to Clinton’s. We rate Clinton’s statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x0000028097DAC980>],/factchecks/2016/jul/28/bill-clinton/bill-clinton-says-more-people-moved-out-poverty-un/

Harry Reid says Trump, Pence want to 'gamble' with Americans' retirement benefits
","Retiring Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid spent what is likely his last turn in the national spotlight throwing shots at the Republican presidential ticket. Reid, speaking at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia on July 27, warned that the ticket of Donald Trump and Indiana Gov. Mike Pence would roll back Democratic accomplishments and de-stabilize Social Security. ""Donald Trump and Mike Pence want to gamble with your retirement benefits in the stock market,"" Reid said. ""Republicans want to tear down the pillars of middle-class security."" Democratic warnings about Republicans meddling with Social Security benefits are a well-trodden line of attack, and one we’ve fact-checked before. But does it apply to Trump and Pence? Strange bedfellows Trump has been somewhat unusual among major Republicans in flatly rejecting any calls for entitlement reform, including Social Security. ""We're gonna save your Social Security without making any cuts,"" he told a crowd in Georgia in February. ""Mark my words."" He responded to a June AARP questionnaire on making Social Security solvent in the future by essentially focusing on economic reforms, and didn’t mention any proposals to change the structure of the entitlement program. ""If we are able to grow the economy, increase the tax base, bring capital and jobs back to the United States and encourage foreign direct investment, we will shore up our entitlement programs for the time being,"" he said. Though he’s been consistent on the issue during this presidential run, Trump sung a different tune back in 2000, when he called for privatizing the entitlement program and compared it to a Ponzi scheme. Entitlement reform, including changes to Social Security, is one of the major policy areas where Pence’s past record hasn’t matched up with Trump’s promises on the campaign trail. Pence has strongly supported several attempts to modify Social Security, but it is an exaggeration to call it ""gambling"" with benefits in the stock market because the choice would be up to workers. While in Congress, Pence backed the 2005 Social Security reform proposal, which would have allowed workers to invest some of their payroll taxes into private accounts and reduced the benefit growth rate for future high-income retirees. Pence even sent a letter to President George W. Bush in 2005 asking him to avoid compromising on the proposal.  He told a CNN interviewer in 2010 that he’d be open to cutting the existing program and raising the retirement age, saying, ""We need look at everything on the menu."" Our ruling Reid said Pence and Trump ""want to gamble with your retirement benefits in the stock market."" Pence may have a record of supporting Republican proposals to change Social Security to allow for more investment into private funds, but Trump has clearly and repeatedly said this campaign cycle he has no plans to modify Social Security or introduce elements similar to the Bush’s failed 2005 attempt to restructure the entitlement program.

Hillary Clinton claims immigrants are more successful at owning businesses than natives
","Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton portrayed immigrants as more successful at starting and running businesses than natives in a recent interview. When Vox editor Ezra Klein asked Clinton if it would be good for the economy to increase immigration, Clinton gave a short answer: yes. ""It is certainly the case that immigration has been and continues to be good for our economy,"" Clinton said June 22 (the interview appeared online July 11). ""Immigrants start businesses at a faster rate; they seem to grow those businesses more successfully."" Clinton’s statement on immigrant-owned businesses interested us. Are immigrants really better than native-born Americans at starting — and growing — successful businesses? What the data shows  Clinton spokesman Josh Schwerin pointed us to analysis from the nonpartisan Kauffman Foundation that shows immigrants are almost ""twice as likely"" to start businesses than natives. The foundation looked at monthly data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s Current Population Survey from 1996 through 2014 and estimated that immigrants have a new entrepreneur rate of 52 percent compared to the native born rate of 27 percent. Their analysis also addressed the success of these businesses, but only within a certain subset - venture-backed firms. Immigrant founders from these companies have created about 150 jobs per company in the United States. According to the foundation, in 2011, 24 of the top 50 venture-backed businesses also had a least one foreign-born founder. Experts we spoke with generally agreed with Clinton’s claim. Although, there are some caveats. University of California, Santa Cruz economics professor Robert Fairlie, who authored a 2012 paper for the Small Business Administration on immigrant entrepreneurs, said that the success of these businesses is not as clear as the start-up data. ""My estimates show that immigrants have a much higher business start rate than non-immigrants,"" Fairlie said. ""There is also evidence showing that immigrant businesses are smaller on average than non-immigrant businesses."" A 2011 report from the bipartisan Partnership for a New American Economy notes that 40 percent of Fortune 500 companies are founded by an immigrant or the child of an immigrant. Although, when the former CEO of AOL repeated this claim, we rated it Half True -- a company’s dominance could be more attributable to recent leaders more so than its founders. However, Clinton’s claim was not as definitive. ""Immigrants are indeed more likely than others to be business owners,"" said David Kallick, a senior fellow at the Fiscal Policy Institute. ""The claims about business ownership are sometimes overstated, but from the Vox quote, I’d say Hillary is on the mark."" Steven Camarota, director of research at the Center for Immigration Studies, which advocates for stricter immigration policies, analyzed the Census Bureau’s 2015 Current Population Survey self-employment data by country for immigrants and natives. He found that immigrants from some countries, such as Brazil and Germany, do have higher business ownership rates than natives. But immigrants from other countries do not. Camarota said it is possible they start businesses at higher rates than natives, but ""they fail at higher rates, too."" But, Colgate University economics professor Chad Sparber, an immigration economy expert, said Clinton’s claim is accurate, noting that federal data shows that immigrants are ""almost always more likely"" to be self-employed than natives. ""Though, self-employment isn’t necessarily the same thing as starting a business,"" Sparber said. Our ruling Clinton said, ""immigrants start businesses at a faster rate; they seem to grow those businesses more successfully."" Federal data and the experts we spoke with back up her claim. While it’s important to note that evidence on the success of immigrant-owned businesses is limited, what we did find supports what Clinton said, that immigrants ""seem"" to grow their businesses better than their native counterparts.

Donald Trump says he and Bernie Sanders are 'very similar' on trade
","The same day the Democratic National Convention opened and Bernie Sanders supporters booed Hillary Clinton in large numbers, Donald Trump sought in North Carolina to win over some of those unhappy Democrats. When it comes to trade policies, Trump is feeling the Bern. ""We have one issue that’s very similar, and that’s trade,"" Trump told The News & Observer before a campaign rally in Winston-Salem on Monday. ""He and I are similar in trade."" Trump has been trying this tactic out since it became clear he and Clinton would be squaring off in the general election. Last month, Trump even quoted Sanders in attacking Clinton. And in Winston-Salem, a city which has seen many of its tobacco and textile factory jobs wither away over the past few decades, Trump further embraced Sanders’ views. Both men have said some of the country’s major trade deals hurt blue collar workers. But we wanted to look into whether their opinions on what’s good, what’s bad and what should be done really are ""very similar,"" as Trump said. NAFTA One of the most well-known trade deals, the North American Free Trade Agreement, passed in the U.S. with bipartisan support in 1993 and went into effect in 1994. It repealed tariffs, which are taxes on imports, for goods shipped between Mexico, Canada and the United States. Democratic President Bill Clinton signed it after his Republican predecessor, George H.W. Bush, started the negotiations. Both parties supported it in Congress. Now, however, it’s facing bipartisan opposition. Both Trump and Sanders have used the word ""disaster"" to describe NAFTA, saying it has led to the loss of hundreds of thousands American jobs. They have different philosophies for dealing with it, however. Trump has suggested directly violating the terms of NAFTA by setting a 35 percent tariff on goods imported into the United States from Mexico. ""We will either renegotiate it or we will break it,"" Trump said in September. Sanders has said he would renegotiate NAFTA but wouldn’t violate it. ""I believe in trade,"" Sanders said in April. ""But I believe in fair trade, not unfettered free trade."" TPP Both Trump and Sanders have criticized the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal between 12 countries on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. Like NAFTA, it would cut tariffs in an effort to spur trade. It was signed earlier this year but has not yet gone into effect. Opposition to the TPP is a key position of the AFL-CIO. It’s not often that Republican presidential nominees find themselves agreeing with organized labor, but in this case Trump does, as does Sanders. Their solutions are the same: The United States should withdraw. They both cite some of the same worries, like the loss of American jobs, concerns about ultra-low wages overseas and the increasingly powerful role of the United Nations. ""U.S. sovereignty will be undermined by giving corporations the right to challenge our laws before international tribunals,"" Sanders wrote in a policy paper on the TPP. ""It would give up all of our economic leverage to an international commission that would put the interests of foreign countries above our own,"" Trump said in a speech last month. China Both Trump and Sanders accuse China of manipulating the value of its currency. The U.S. Treasury hasn’t officially done so, although in April it put China on watch along with Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Germany. Both also criticize China’s inclusion in the World Trade Organization and the normalization of U.S.-China trade relations in 2000. They differ in how to use domestic policy to bolster the U.S. position, however. Trump said the U.S. should lower its corporate income tax rate to better compete with China and keep jobs here. Sanders disagrees and would collect more corporate tax revenue in order to create jobs via new infrastructure projects. They also differ in the longevity of their anti-China views. Trump has, for years, outsourced labor to China for various Trump brand products – Trump ties, cufflinks and some shirts are made in China, PolitiFact found recently. Trump has explained his avoidance of American manufacturing companies by saying ""they don’t even make this stuff here."" However, our friends at FactCheck.org found that to be false. Sanders has opposed the normalization of trade relations with China since the start. Then-Rep. Sanders said on the House floor in 2000 that ""it is not a good deal for American workers. American workers should not be asked to compete against desperate people in China who are forced to work at starvation wages, who cannot form free trade unions, who do not even have the legal right to stand up and criticize their government."" Our ruling Donald Trump, in an effort to win over Bernie Sanders supporters, said their policies on trade are ""very similar."" There are some notable differences. Sanders has always opposed normal trade with China. Trump says he’s opposed, although he outsources some of his own manufacturing to China. The two also have different ideas for dealing with NAFTA and on the role corporate tax policy plays in trade. Yet in the grand scheme of things on the campaign trail, both men have consistently argued for protectionist trade policies as opposed to free trade. Some details differ, but they agree on the broad philosophy of opposition to free trade deals.

"['Colorado', 'LGBTQ', 'Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee']","
DCCC links Mike Pence to Mike Coffman, says both 'oppose equal rights for LGBT Americans'
","The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee said GOP vice presidential nominee Mike Pence and Colorado Republican Rep. Mike Coffman oppose gay rights. A July 20 DCCC news release says that Coffman, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and Pence make for an ""extreme"" ticket and Trump and Coffman ""share many of the same dangerous ideas."" It compares Coffman’s and Pence’s record on eight different issues, from the minimum wage to abortion. The implication is that Pence and Coffman share the same positions, including on gay rights. ""Trump’s VP pick also makes perfect sense for Coffman, given that they take the same positions on a number of things like ... Coffman and Pence oppose equal rights for LGBT Americans,"" the release states. PolitiFact dug into the claim that Pence and Coffman ""take the same positions"" in their opposition to equal rights for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Americans. The DCCC release tries to back up its claim by saying when Pence was an Indiana congressman in 2007, he said the Employment Non-Discrimination Act -- a bill known as ENDA that sought to prohibit employment discrimination against gay people -- ""wages war on freedom of religion in the workplace."" The release failed to mention that Coffman took a different approach; he co-sponsored a 2013 version of ENDA. In other words, Coffman supported legislation to prohibit workplace discrimination based on ""sexual orientation or gender identity"" that Pence opposed in 2007. We asked about the omission, and a DCCC spokesman said ""that was just for space"" given that the release was running five-pages long. The news release cited Coffman’s opposition to same-sex marriage, referring to Denver Post coverage of a 2014 election debate where he said, ""Certainly I believe marriage is between a man and a woman. Ultimately it’s going to be up to the voters of Colorado to make that decision. I will respect as a member of Congress whatever decision that they make."" In a series of yes-or-no questions, Coffman answered ""no"" when asked, ""Should Colorado recognize same-sex marriage?"" He also replied ""yes"" when asked, ""Do you support Colorado’s ban on same-sex marriage?""   After the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2015 that the Constitution guarantees a right to same-sex message, some Colorado Republican lawmakers condemned the decision. Coffman, however, said in a statement, ""The world is changing, and while I’ve supported traditional marriage, the court has ruled a ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. It is time we move forward and focus on the big debates of our day — how to keep our country safe and get Americans back to work."" Coffman’s spokeswoman, Cinamon Watson, dismissed the DCCC attack as ""a bald-faced lie,"" saying Coffman is ""no Mike Pence"" on gay rights. She directed us to praise of Coffman by an array of LGBT organizations and Democratic flip-flopping on gay marriage by President Barack Obama and presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Supporting gay rights Coffman does have a mixed record on support for LGBT rights, which some attribute to the 2011 redistricting of his 6th Congressional District, which shifted from staunchly conservative to a more diverse, middle-of-the-road swath of Denver suburbs. Gay advocacy groups have lauded Coffman for taking certain stands. Examples include: He was also the only Republican to co-sponsor the Freedom from Discrimination in Credit Act of 2015, which seeks to expand the Equal Credit Opportunity Act to prohibit discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity. In addition, he voted for the Peters’ Amendment, which prohibits discrimination in federal transportation and housing programs and passed the House with strong bipartisan support.   Coffman’s support for LGBT rights contrasts with Mike Pence’s hard-line stand on social issues. In April 2015, Coffman was one of eight Republicans who penned a letter to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights praising the agency's first-ever briefing dedicated to discrimination against LGBT Americans, The Hill reported. The letter came in the aftermath of the controversy over an Indiana religious freedom law signed by Pence, who later signed a revised measure facing business boycotts and a firestorm of criticism. ""(Coffman) is as not as extreme as Mike Pence, and I would say not many people are as extreme as Mike Pence,"" Austin Montoya, spokesman for One Colorado, told PolitiFact. Opposing gay rights Coffman has taken other positions, though, that advocates of gay rights don’t like. Montoya cited Coffman’s votes against repealing the military’s ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" policy, and his support of the Defense of Marriage Act (before the U.S. Supreme Court overturned the law that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples in 2013). And while Coffman did co-sponsor the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which failed to become law, Montoya noted that Coffman has not co-sponsored the more expansive Equality Act, which would amend the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to include discrimination protection based on sexual orientation and gender identity. Our ruling A DCCC news release said, ""Coffman and Pence oppose equal rights for LGBT Americans."" The release stated that Coffman and Pence ""take the same positions on a number of things,"" including on gay rights. DCCC and other critics have a point in saying Coffman opposed same-sex marriage, repealing the military’s ""Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell"" policy and he supported the Defense of Marriage Act.    But he has backed legislation to protect gay Americans from discrimination in the workplace, in securing credit, in federal transportation and housing programs and in military benefits. Advocacy groups have praised Coffman’s support on some protections and said he is not as steadfast an opponent as Pence. We found several examples where the pair do not align. We rate this claim Mostly False. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/fb91919a-bd52-46a0-af26-f910a8c191f8",[<zip object at 0x0000028097182600>],/factchecks/2016/jul/27/democratic-congressional-campaign-committee/dccc-links-mike-pence-mike-coffman-says-both-oppos/

Trump said the Democrats caved and added flags after he and others noticed. Is that true? Well, there is some evidence to the fact. A false flag?

That particular viral image is bogus, there is no ban. But what about Trump’s more-tempered claim that there was ""not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention""? Capture the flag We’re here at the DNC and have seen American flags at the Wells Fargo Center. The issue -- to the extent that Trump and others are making it an issue -- surrounds the stage that Democrats built in Philadelphia. The stage includes huge video boards that serve as the main visual element for delegates in the arena and viewers on TV back at home. One of our editors, Amy Hollyfield, snapped this photo before the convention opened July 25, 2016. It shows the set-up we described … and sizable virtual American flags on the video board.  Hard to miss the flag there. But where Trump and some people may have a point is that there did not appear to be physical flags on the stage during the first night of the convention. A physical flag did appear during the Pledge of Allegiance and the National Anthem. You can see it, if you don’t believe us, at 31 minutes into this video of the convention’s proceedings. But when the color guard left, so did the physical flag. Flags appear! Trump also has a point that flags were added to the stage, starting with the second day of the convention July 26, 2016. But it wasn’t just one, and they weren’t necessarily small. Here’s a pre-flag photo from Bernie Sanders’ speech on the first night of the convention, taken by Stephen Crowley of the New York Times.  And here’s a photo from Ruth Fremson of the New York Times from the next night.  It may be hard to see, but the DNC did add a series of flags along the edge of the stage. You can see them in the shadows in the righthand side of the photo. Here’s a better view. This photo was taken by Stephen Crowley, also of the New York Times.  We asked DNC Communications Director Luis Miranda why flags were added to the stage Tuesday (and why they weren’t there Monday). If we hear back, we’ll let you know. We also reached out to the Trump campaign but did not hear back. Our ruling Trump said on Twitter, ""Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one. Pathetic."" A huge video board prominently displayed the American flag during the first day. The proof is in the photos. And a physical flag made an appearance during the National Anthem. But Trump has a point that physical flags (plural) appear to have been added to the stage for the second day of the Democratic National Convention, after some stories reported the lack of flags. Trump is partially accurate. We rate the claim Half True. Update: After we published, and thanks to a reader, we came across photos from the day before the convention, July 24, that showed flags on the wings of the stage. Here is a photo of the flags from Josh Haner of the New York Times:  So the flags were in place before the convention started and removed for the first day ... but reappeared on July 26. We still haven't heard back from the DNC explaining what happened. https://www.sharethefacts.co/share/2e8e3eb1-ed26-4a7c-95e7-20a6725bd03b",[<zip object at 0x00000280971B6C80>],/factchecks/2016/jul/27/donald-trump/dnc-flag-missing-controversy/

Wisconsin Democrats claim Ron Johnson opposes faster rural broadband, took money from industry
","In June 2016, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson aired a TV ad emphasizing his humble beginnings as a dishwasher and machine operator. The next day, the Democratic Party of Wisconsin released a radio ad arguing just the opposite. The ad painted the Republican Johnson as a ""multi-millionaire CEO turned Senator"" out of touch with the needs of Wisconsinites living in rural areas. ""Living in the country doesn’t mean we should have fewer opportunities,"" the speaker says. ""Unfortunately, that’s what Wisconsin gets with Sen. Ron Johnson."" Later the speaker says: ""He opposes faster broadband internet in small towns. Maybe because he got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests."" Former U.S. Sen. Russ Feingold, running against Johnson, has argued for rural broadband to be more like a public utility. Johnson opposes that idea. But that doesn’t mean he opposes bringing faster broadband to rural areas. Let’s examine the two parts of the claim one at a time. Faster internet in rural small towns Many Wisconsinites in rural areas lack access to reliable, high-speed internet. While the Federal Communications Commission has said maximizing access to broadband internet is a priority, there is widespread disagreement about how to pay for the infrastructure upgrades needed to make it a reality. Harry Hartfield, communications director for the Democratic Party of Wisconsin said Johnson’s voting record demonstrates he opposes to faster broadband in rural areas. He pointed to two votes in particular: In 2012, Johnson voted for a Senate bill amendment that would have eliminated the authority of the Agriculture Department to increase the amount of federal grants to provide broadband access in rural areas. In 2013, Johnson voted against a Senate bill amendment that established a pilot program to expand high speed broadband service to rural areas. ""If (Johnson) supported faster internet in rural communities, he would have supported legislation that did just that,"" Hartfield said. Hartfield also noted Johnson and five other Republican senators argued the definition of broadband was ""too fast"" in a 2016 letter to the FCC chairman, since few applications require download speeds of 25 Mbps, the new standard. They gave the example of Netflix, which recommends download speeds of 5 Mbps to stream high-definition video. The letter’s authors said they worried increased regulation as a result of the standard would disincentivize telecommunications companies to offer higher speeds. Barry Orton, a professor emeritus of telecommunications at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, said that most households have more than one person using the internet at once, which makes faster speeds necessary. ""Why are they writing a letter saying don’t expand the broadband definition?"" said Orton, who helped Feingold’s campaign develop its broadband materials. ""Because expansion of the broadband definition doesn’t help existing providers that are offering less than that."" For its part, Johnson’s campaign says he supports increased broadband connectivity — but wants the private sector deliver the services. ""Ron has worked on a bipartisan basis to create an environment where more broadband companies can invest and innovate to provide better internet access and more choice across Wisconsin,"" Johnson’s campaign said in an April statement. Campaign spokesman Brian Reisinger provided two additional letters to support this stance. A 2013 letter signed by Johnson and U.S. Sen. Tammy Baldwin, a Democrat, urged the FCC to finalize its plan to distribute funds for deployment of broadband to rural areas. A 2014 letter signed by more than 40 senators asked the FCC to carefully update rules governing broadband in rural areas to encourage competition. So, while the party cited two votes, it did not give a full picture of Johnson’s record on the matter. Indeed, there may be multiple ways to achieve the same goal. Contributions from telecom special interests The ad also claims Johnson’s campaign got ""nearly $90,000"" in contributions from telecommunications special interests. The Democratic Party of Wisconsin cited OpenSecrets.org, a website that pulls from Federal Election Committee data, which shows Johnson received at least $95,000 in contributions since 2010 from political action committees representing ""telecom services"" companies, including AT&T, Charter and Comcast. Our rating The Democratic Party’s radio ad said Johnson ""opposes faster broadband internet in small towns"" and he ""got nearly $90,000 in campaign contributions from the telecom special interests."" Johnson’s voting record shows he opposed two particular proposals to grow faster broadband in rural areas and one signed letter to the FCC showed he was against a faster definition of broadband. But two other letters to the FCC suggest he’s in favor of faster rural broadband — but concerned with its execution. Johnson’s campaign has said he supports using the private sector to grow rural broadband. The second part of the claim is on point — Johnson actually received somewhat more from the industry than the ad claimed. On balance, we rate the claim Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809718DD00>],/factchecks/2016/jul/27/state-democratic-party-wisconsin/wisconsin-democrats-claim-ron-johnson-opposes-fast/

Bill Clinton praises Hillary's 'half-court shot' on Iran sanctions as secretary of state
","President Barack Obama had to ask Hillary Clinton more than once if she would be his secretary of state, but it was worth the effort, former President Bill Clinton said in a speech praising his wife’s record. ""As secretary of state, she worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program,"" Clinton said on the second night of the 2016 Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. ""And in what the Wall Street Journal no less called a half-court shot at the buzzer, she got Russia and China to support them."" This sounded like a fact-check we’ve done before. On the campaign trail, Hillary Clinton has said she put together the sanctions that helped usher Iran to the negotiating table, ultimately resulting in the landmark nuclear deal. We rated this claim Mostly True.   Throughout her first 18 months as secretary of state — from January 2009 to June 2010 — U.S. and global sanctions on Iran increased, and it’s fair to say that Clinton and the State Department played a major role in this development. The invitation Upping sanctions on Iran was a clear priority for Clinton’s State Department. She talked at length about the importance of pressuring Iran to discontinue nuclear activity, including through sanctions, at her nomination hearing in January 2009. She and other members of the Obama administration spoke publicly about the topic regularly. The State Department, including top aides and Clinton herself, led the diplomatic effort to get other countries to join the U.S. plan to pressure Iran, overcoming large hurdles such as getting Russia and China on board. In her memoir Hard Choices, Clinton recalls hashing out final details of a plan over drinks with a Chinese official. The New York Times reported that she personally talked with Russian foreign minister Sergey Lavrov. As Bill Clinton said in his speech, a Wall Street Journal editorial did call this feat ""a half-court shot at the buzzer."" In June 2010, the United Nations Security Council approved tough new sanctions on Iran, including expanding an arms embargo and restricting certain financial and shipping enterprises. At the time, Obama called them ""the toughest sanctions ever faced by the Iranian government."" Those sanctions enabled even tougher measures from the United States and the European Union, which were passed immediately. Congress passed several more bills containing additional sanctions on Iran during the rest of Clinton’s tenure, which ended in early 2013. While the Treasury Department is the primary agency responsible for enforcing sanctions, Clinton appointed a special adviser in 2010 to oversee U.S. efforts ""to ensure full and effective implementation of all U.N. Security Council resolutions related to Iran, including most recently UNSCR 1929."" Experts told us that Clinton is correct to take some of the credit for the rapid increase in international sanctions on Iran, and these sanctions were a big part of the reason why Iran rejoined multilateral talks about its nuclear program. The RSVP The State Department was key to getting other countries to go along with and add to U.S. efforts to pressure Iran, said Patrick Clawson, senior fellow and research director at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The international sanction ramp-up ""shocked Iran's leaders,"" Clawson said. ""Besides the pain the sanctions inflicted, they raised the possibility more — worse — was coming. That was a key factor pushing Iran to resume more serious talks."" There is room for subjective interpretation on who deserves the credit for effective sanctions because many corners of the U.S. government are involved in the Iran effort, said Suzanne Maloney, deputy director of the foreign policy program at the Brookings Institution. But the State Department had its hands in every aspect of new sanction-making and implementation. And in the absence of the United Nations resolution, which was Clinton’s lobbying success, it would have been challenging to get a global coalition to significantly ramp up the sanctions, she said. But whether sanctions were a big factor in bringing Iran to the negotiating table is not crystal clear, Maloney said. Iranian officials have historically denied the significance of sanctions, but Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has said recently that Iran negotiated the deal specifically to have sanctions lifted. Beyond the multilateral effort, Clinton’s team also played a role in the sanctions that Congress passed, said Richard Nephew, an expert on sanctions with the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. Lawmakers would not have written that legislation without consulting the State Department and the administration (as evidenced in this 2010 New York Times article). Nephew noted, though, that Congress did pass some sanctions that went further than the administration’s wishes. ""Without Secretary Clinton's good diplomacy— and the message that she radiated down the system to make this a priority and so forth — you can argue that the reductions would not have been as steep or as lasting,"" Nephew said. Congress’ sanctions that affect Iran’s oil exports resulted in a 50 percent reduction in oil exports and were instrumental in getting Iran to the negotiating table, said Nephew, who worked at the State Department under Clinton. Our ruling Bill Clinton said, ""As secretary of state, (Hillary Clinton) worked hard to get strong sanctions against Iran's nuclear program"" and ""got Russia and China to support them."" During Hillary Clinton’s first 18 months as secretary, the State Department led the global effort to increase sanctions on Iran — notably getting Russia and China on board — culminating in an important U.N. resolution. Clinton was personally involved in these diplomatic efforts and pushed them publicly. Experts said these sanctions, on top of other sanctions passed before and after, were crucial to getting Iran to the negotiating table. However, Clinton wasn’t singularly responsible for the sanctions or getting China and Russia to support them, just as the sanctions passed under her watch likely weren’t singularly responsible for opening up Iran to talks.

Bill Clinton exaggerates increase in world opinion of U.S. under Secretary of State Hillary Clinton
","During Bill Clinton’s Democratic convention speech about Hillary Clinton, the former president touted his wife’s efforts as secretary of state to improve the levels of support for the United States across the globe. He cited his wife as ""one of the reasons the approval of the United States was 20 points higher when she left the secretary of state's office than when she took it."" We decided to check whether the approval ratings he cited were accurate. We found four surveys that asked questions on a regular basis about how the United States is seen in other countries. We’ll go through them one by one. Pew Research Center We found Pew data for surveys taken in 20 countries between 2008 and 2013. Respondents were asked, ""Please tell me if you have a very favorable, somewhat favorable, somewhat unfavorable or very unfavorable opinion of the United States."" The figures in the chart below show the change in the favorable ratings -- either up or down -- between 2008, the year before Clinton became secretary of state, and 2013, the year she stepped down from the post. The countries are listed in descending order from the most positive change to the most negative change during her tenure.   Country Change in approval of U.S., 2008-13* Spain +29 Indonesia +24 Germany +22 France +22 Australia +20 Argentina +19 Japan +19 Mexico +19 South Africa +12 Tanzania +10 Turkey +9 South Korea +8 Russia +5 United Kingdom +5 Poland -1 China -1 Lebanon -4 Jordan -5 Egypt -6 Pakistan -8 Median country, not weighted for population +10 * except Tanzania, which is for the years 2008 to 2014 So eight countries met or came close to the 20-point increase Clinton cited, but 12 did not. Taking into account the whole list of 20 countries, the median change for the countries surveyed was a gain of 10 percentage points. That’s a significant increase, but it’s not the 20 percentage-point increase Clinton cited. BBC As we have previously noted, the BBC World Service/Globescan survey undertakes an annual country ratings poll that asks about respondents’ view of various countries’ ""influence in the world"" -- either ""mostly positive"" or ""mostly negative."" In 2008, the poll found that 35 percent of people said world influence of the United States was ""mostly positive"" and 47 percent said it was ""mostly negative."" In the late 2012-early 2013 poll, that number had risen to 45 percent. That’s an increase of 10 percentage points during Clinton’s tenure -- in line with the median country in the Pew survey, but still half of what Bill Clinton said. Gallup Finally, every year, Gallup has asked respondents in various countries, ""Do you approve or disapprove of the job performance of the leaders"" of various countries, including the United States. In 2008, the United States had a 34 percent approval rating. By 2013, that had risen to 46 percent. That’s an increase of 12 percentage points -- once again, roughly in line with the Pew and BBC polls and less than what Clinton said.  Meridian International Center When we asked the Clinton campaign for supporting evidence, they pointed to a survey by the Meridian International Center and Gallup’s U.S.-Global Leadership Project. Between 2008 and 2013, they said, the median U.S. approval rating in Europe grew from 18 percent to 41 percent. That’s a 23-point increase--but it’s also just for Europe, a limitation Clinton didn’t specify. And the data for Asia in the same poll and the same time frame, according to the campaign, showed an increase from 31 percent to 45 percent. That’s a rise of 14 points, which is less than the 20-point benchmark Clinton used. So we don’t see the Meridian International Center data as supporting Clinton’s assertion. Our ruling Bill Clinton said, ""The approval of the United States was 20 points higher when (Hillary Clinton) left the secretary of state's office than when she took it."" The approval ratings for the United States did go up on Hillary Clinton’s watch, and the Pew poll found that in some countries they did go up by 19 points or more. Still, the median increase in the Pew polling was a more modest 10 points, and the increases in the BBC and Gallup polls were in the same ballpark -- 10 to 12 points.

Hillary Clinton video says Donald Trump admitted that he can't say he treats women with respect
","Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has been repeatedly attacked by his opponents for his sometimes-derogatory statements about women. At the Democratic convention in Philadelphia, delegates saw a video where some of those comments were repeated, but one caught our eye. At the end of the 30-second video a voice says, ""So you treat women with respect."" The video shifts to a younger Trump saying sheepishly, ""I can't say that either"" and offering a half-laugh. The clip is so short, we wondered if it was an accurate representation of the interview. We emailed the Democratic National Committee about its source. They couldn't immediately provide it but, meanwhile, we found it thanks to The Washington Post Fact-Checker examination of two pro-Clinton ads in June. The video shown at the Democratic convention was originally an ad released by the Hillary Clinton campaign. The source of the quote comes from a 39-minute interview with Howard Stern conducted in 1993 on the E! cable channel. Stern is not shown in the clip, although some might recognize his voice. The shock-jock is known for getting his guests to say outrageous things. The interview was conducted after a New York magazine article on Trump said, ""His contempt for beautiful women who liked to be abused is boundless."" The article characterized his philosophy as, ""You have to treat them like s---,"" a characterization by author Julie Baumgold, not a direct quote from Trump himself. In the interview, Stern asks Trump about the quote. ""No, I never said that,"" Trump responds.""But it was attributed to me."" After some chatter by Stern, Trump again denies saying it. ""I see,"" says Stern. ""So you treat women with respect."" Trump smiles. ""Ahhhh. I can't say that either,"" he says with a chortle. ""Alright, good,"" says Stern. ""Somewhere in between."" Then Trump adds, ""I treat women with great respect,"" his tone sounding more serious this time, but it's not completely clear because the camera, at this point, is on Stern instead of Trump. Stern then insists, with the help of a chart, that Trump rank his wife and girlfriends. When we asked the Clinton campaign if Trump's comment was taken out of context, deputy communications director Christina Reynolds responded with an emailed statement that ""in a conversation about whether he respects (women), his first inclination is to say that he 'can't say.' That statement, coming during an exchange about previous disrespectful comments about women, speaks volumes and is perfectly in context with his lifelong record."" Our ruling Hillary Clinton, in a campaign ad shown at the Democratic convention, said that when an interviewer asked Donald Trump if he treats women with respect, Trump replied, ""I can't say that."" The four-second clip has not been doctored. But this is an example of where context can be crucial. It omits the fact that Stern is the interviewer. The opening question of whether Trump said he treats women like feces, Trump's denial, Stern's assessment that it's ""somewhere in between"" and Trump's subsequent response that ""I treat women with great respect"" are all missing. Because so much is ignored in this brief clip— information that could give a different impression — we rate the claim Mostly False.",[<zip object at 0x000002809C43B400>],/factchecks/2016/jul/27/hillary-clinton/hillary-clinton-video-says-donald-trump-admitted-h/

Did Donald Trump 'cash in' $150,000 after 9/11?
","U.S. Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-N.Y., made a serious charge  on the second night of the Democratic National Convention about Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump making money off of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. Crowley, who lost a cousin that day, (accurately) painted Hillary Clinton as someone who was there for the city and its first-responders. Trump, however, ""saw a payday for his empire,"" Crowley said. ""Where was Donald Trump in the days and months and the years after 9/11? He didn’t stand at the pile, he didn’t lobby Congress for help, he didn’t fight for the first responders,"" he said. ""Nope, he cashed in, collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover — even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected."" Did Trump, a New Yorker, take taxpayer-funded money earmarked for small businesses and for losses he said he didn’t even suffer? A spokeswoman for Crowley referred us to a 2006 New York Daily News investigation. The Daily News found that Trump did receive $150,000 for the Trump Building, which is less than a mile away from the World Trade Center. But Crowley’s charge is misleading as it suggests Trump took advantage of the program, when his property at 40 Wall Street did meet the criteria for the money. Under the 9/11 business recovery grant program run by the Empire State Development, New York’s economic development agency, firms were eligible if they employed 500 employees or less, had been physically or economically damaged by the attacks, and located on or south of 14th Street in Lower Manhattan. According to the Daily News, Trump’s ""grant application describes the corporation through which Trump owns that building as having 28 employees and $26.8 million in annual revenues."" (The newspaper notes that the federal definition of a small business is $6 million.) Trump’s was among over 14,000 companies that received grants totalling $530 million. That includes other firms like the Rockefeller Group, Ford Motors, Dell Inc., Morgan Stanley and the Bank of China. Was the Trump Building impacted by the 9/11? According to Trump, no, though he was likely referring to physical damages. ""I have a lot of property down there,"" he told a German TV reporter after the attack. ""But it wasn’t, fortunately, affected by what happened to the World Trade Center."" Here’s how Trump responded when the New York Times asked him about the grant in May 2016: ""The company received this small amount of money after qualifying, given the limited number of employees working at the property. For many months, I allowed people to stay in the building, use the building and store things in the building. I was happy to do it and to this day I am still being thanked for the many people I helped. The value of what I did was far greater than the money talked about."" Our ruling Crowley said Trump ""cashed in, collecting $150,000 in federal funds intended to help small businesses recover — even though days after the attack Trump said his properties were not affected."" Trump did receive a grant for his building at 40 Wall Street, which was less than a mile away from the Trade Center, but the property was eligible under the grant criteria. He also did say in 2001 that his properties were not affected by the attack, although he likely meant physically. The grant also provided compensation for economic losses.

It concerns recommendations for how to care for children during disasters such as severe weather events that may cause children to be temporarily separated from families. The advisory doesn’t mention COVID-19 or the coronavirus.

Fact-checking Joe Biden’s claim about his own income
","Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden talked up his tax plan during a conversation with steelworkers in Detroit. ""Every single thing I talk about, I pay for, by making sure, for the first time, the wealthy begin to pay what they should be paying,"" Biden said Sept. 9. ""We’re not going to punish anybody. No one making under $400,000, which is more money than I’ve ever made, is going to have to pay more taxes."" Broadly speaking, Biden’s changes would repeal provisions in President Donald Trump’s tax law for taxpayers earning over $400,000 and increase the top corporate tax rate to 28% from 21%, among other measures. Independent analysts agree that Biden’s plan would not directly raise taxes for those earning less than $400,000, though those workers could feel the indirect effects of a corporate tax hike.  But what about Biden’s description of his own earning history? When Thomas Kaplan of the New York Times reported on the event in Detroit, he noted parenthetically that ""Mr. Biden has, in fact, made more than $400,000; his tax returns from 2017 and 2018 showed income of many multiples that amount.""

(Their 2019 tax return has not yet been made public.) This pattern makes sense: As a senator and later as vice president, Joe Biden’s salary was fixed by law, and Jill Biden worked in teaching. As vice president, Biden earned up to $230,700 a year, and as a senator his annual salary varied from $44,600 when he began serving in the Senate in 1973 to $169,300 by the time he left the chamber in January 2009. The Bidens’ returns going back to 2008 also include income from Social Security benefits. But once Biden departed the vice presidency in January 2017, he could take advantage of more lucrative private-sector opportunities. Both Bidens wrote books afterward, and Joe Biden’s presidential financial disclosure form lists more than four dozen events characterized either as speaking engagements or book tour events, for each of which he typically earned five- and six-figure payments. When we reached out to the Biden campaign, they said he was referring to his full-time annual salaries as a public official, and that as an employee of the New Castle, Del., county council and a U.S. senator, he never made more than $400,000 annually.  Biden said $400,000 ""is more money than I’ve ever made"" in a year. That was accurate for most of Biden’s career, when he was in public service and his wife Jill was in teaching. But after Biden left the vice presidency, he earned money from speaking engagements and a book tour, and the couple reported a combined adjusted gross income of more than $11 million and $4 million in successive years.

In Pa. House race, Perry fails to tie DePasquale to AOC over defunding police, socialized medicine
","In a tossup race in Pennsylvania, Republican Rep. Scott Perry links Democratic challenger Eugene DePasquale to a more liberal Democrat, New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. But DePasquale doesn’t share Ocasio-Cortez’s position on any of the three issues Perry cites. The race is one of 18 pivotal House and Senate contests up for election on Nov. 3 that PolitiFact is tracking.  Using Ocasio-Cortez’s well-known initials, Perry claims in a TV ad that ""AOC"" and DePasquale support ""socialized medicine,"" the Green New Deal and defunding the police. Midway through the 30-second spot, the image of a clenched fist and the words ""radical socialist agenda"" appear between photos of Ocasio-Cortez and DePasquale, who is Pennsylvania’s auditor. DePasquale does not support any of the three proposals. A few words on health care verbiage: Universal coverage is any method of ensuring that all of a country’s residents have health insurance.  Single-payer is a system in which one entity — usually but not always a government, as with Medicare — pays for needed health care services, but the delivery system remains mostly private.  That’s not the same as socialized medicine, which generally refers to a system in which the government pays all the bills, owns the health facilities and employs the health professionals who work there.  Ocasio-Cortez: Her House website calls her ""an unapologetic advocate of Medicare for All, which would create a universal, single payer healthcare system.""  DePasquale: Perry cited a March 2020 interview in which DePasquale said he supports universal health care, not socialized medicine. He said he backs allowing people the option to keep their private coverage, such as from an employer, or buy into Medicare. And he supports enrolling in Medicaid those who can’t afford either of those options. DePasquale has said he does not support Medicare for All. Ocasio-Cortez: She introduced the Green New Deal, which proposes ways to curb climate change and protect the environment, in February 2019.  DePasquale: In July 2019, a day after announcing his candidacy, DePasquale said he would not push for policies such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for All that are advocated by the more liberal wing of the party, the York Dispatch reported. Ocasio-Cortez: In June, after the New York City Council and Mayor Bill de Blasio reached a deal to cut $1 billion from the New York Police Department’s $6 billion budget, Ocasio-Cortez said: ""Defunding police means defunding police. It does not mean budget tricks or funny math. ...This is not a victory. The fight to defund policing continues."" DePasquale: DePasquale said in June he supports police reforms such as curbing the transfer of military grade weapons to local law enforcement, providing antibias training and banning chokeholds, but that ""defunding our police departments is not the answer.""

No, the CDC hasn’t stopped calling COVID-19 a pandemic
","On March 11, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. At the time, more than 118,000 cases of COVID-19 had been identified in over 110 countries worldwide, and the disease has continued to spread since. Now, more than 27 million cases of COVID-19 have been reported globally, according to Johns Hopkins University’s Coronavirus Resource Center. But some social media users are still questioning the terms used to describe the disease. ""The CDC has removed the ‘Covid-19 Pandemic’ and replaced it with ‘Covid-19 Outbreak’ on their website,"" one Facebook post says. ""It was never a pandemic."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) The post mischaracterizes the coronavirus updates on the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s website homepage. As early as Jan. 18, the CDC’s top homepage story was about the coronavirus. ""CDC is closely monitoring an outbreak caused by a novel (new) coronavirus in Wuhan City, China,"" the story said, according to an archived version of the page. The CDC was also using the term ""outbreak"" in February and March, archived pages show. The CDC homepage still refers to the virus as an outbreak on its homepage. However, the use of the term ""outbreak"" doesn’t mean COVID-19 is not a pandemic, as the CDC’s website explains. The site defines outbreak as ""a higher-­than-expected number of occurrences of disease in a specific location and time."" ""An outbreak is called an epidemic when there is a sudden increase in cases. As COVID-19 began spreading in Wuhan, China, it became an epidemic,"" the website explains. ""Because the disease then spread across several countries and affected a large number of people, it was classified as a pandemic."" The CDC site uses the term ""outbreak"" to describe COVID-19 on its homepage, while ""pandemic"" is used elsewhere on the site. The post also incorrectly asserts that COVID-19 was never a pandemic. The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on March 11 and has not changed that designation.  The CDC refers to COVID-19 as a pandemic on various website pages dedicated to providing coronavirus information, including the ""Global COVID-19"" page, the ""Travel during the COVID-19 Pandemic"" page and others. The CDC’s page about influenza pandemics, which was last updated on May 12, plainly declares: ""The United States is NOT currently experiencing an influenza pandemic. There is an ongoing pandemic with a new coronavirus."" A Facebook post claims, ""The CDC has removed the ‘Covid-19 Pandemic’ and replaced it with ‘Covid-19 Outbreak’ on their website. It was never a pandemic."" The CDC website’s homepage currently refers to the ""novel coronavirus outbreak,"" and has been using that term since January.

Trump’s misleading claim about 'unsolicited' mail ballots
","President Donald Trump, the nation’s most prominent critic of voting by mail, has repeatedly said that 80 million ballots will be mailed to voters who didn’t request them this fall. ""And the dirtiest fight of all is the issuance of 80 million ballots, unrequested,"" Trump said during his Labor Day remarks. ""They're not requested; they're just sending 80 million ballots all over the country. Eighty million ballots, non-requested. I call them ‘unsolicited ballots.’ That's going to be the dirtiest fight of all. People are going to get ballots; they're going to say, ‘What am I doing?’ And then they're going to harvest. They're going to do all the things."" Trump made similar remarks about mail in ballots during his Aug. 24 speech at the Republican National Convention and the next day on Twitter, where he described the mailing out of these ""unsolicited"" ballots as ""fraudulent"" or a ""scam."" It’s not yet clear precisely how many voters will receive ballots without requesting them by mail, because voter registration is not yet closed for the Nov. 3 election. But based on our research, we found that Trump has exaggerated the number. He also omitted the fact that millions of voters have automatically received ballots in some states for many years without it leading to widespread fraud. Millions more voters are expected to cast ballots by mail this year than in previous presidential elections. Five states — Colorado, Hawaii, Oregon, Utah, and Washington — have operated virtually all mail-in elections prior to 2020, some of them for many years. Voters are routinely mailed ballots in these states as part of the regular process.  The pandemic this year has raised concerns about large groups of voters gathering indoors, so some additional states — California, Nevada, New Jersey, Vermont plus Washington, D.C. — have decided to send ballots to all active voters.  In other states, voters have to take action to request a mail ballot, though some of them took that step already if they live in a state that allows a permanent absentee voting list that may be offered to all voters, or only to certain voters based on specific criteria such as age or disability. We asked the Trump campaign to show how it arrived at 80 million unsolicited ballots, and whether that included a handful of states that have generally held all vote-by-mail elections for years. We did not receive a response.  It’s possible that Trump or an aide saw a prediction in an August New York Times article that ""80 million mail ballots will flood election offices this fall.""  However, that figure isn’t limited to voters who will be sent ""unsolicited"" ballots. It includes voters who will have to request a mail ballot. The New York Times found that ballots will be mailed directly to about 44 million voters in nine states and D.C. So that’s a little more than half of the figure Trump cited.  University of Florida political scientist Michael McDonald found a similar total number of ballots — 44.4 million — that will be sent in states conducting all-mail elections. He also counted Montana, where Gov. Steve Bullock used his emergency powers to allow counties to opt in to holding an all-mail election. As of late August, most Montana counties opted for all mail.  Paul Gronke, an expert on voting by mail at Reed College, predicted somewhere north of 80 million ballots will be cast by mail, double 2016’s total. In D.C. and the states that decided to send ballots to all voters this year due to the pandemic, many of those voters would have likely requested a ballot anyway or were on permanent absentee-ballot lists. For example, in California in 2016, there were 13 million ballots cast, including 7 million absentee. Gronke added up how many ballots were cast by absentee during the 2016 elections in California, Nevada, New Jersey and Vermont and concluded at most, 7.5 million or so ballots will be sent in those states to voters who have not requested them. In the state that is holding the largest all-mail election — California — about two-thirds of the voters had registered to vote absentee even before the move to mail every voter a ballot, said Nate Persily, a Stanford law professor. While Trump uses the terms ""unsolicited"" or ""unrequested"" ballots, states generally use other terms such as ""voting by mail."" Some experts were critical of Trump’s terms, noting that if residents don’t want to receive a ballot, they don’t have to register in the states that automatically send them. ""In an all-mail ballot state, voter registration is a mail-ballot request,"" McDonald said. MIT professor Charles Stewart said he personally wouldn’t use the word ""unsolicited"" but thinks it’s fair game in political discourse. ""As to ‘unsolicited,’ I think that’s a fair, if loaded, term,"" he said. ""You don’t have to ask for a ballot, and there are voters in those states who would prefer not to be mailed one."" Trump criticized the effort to send ballots unrequested, and said that voters who receive them are ""going to harvest.""  Ballot harvesting generally refers to someone collecting absentee ballots on behalf of others and then submitting them. Some voting rights experts see the unofficial term ""ballot harvesting"" as pejorative and prefer the term ""ballot collection."" Many states allow at least certain individuals to collect some ballots on behalf of others, which can be helpful for voters with disabilities or those without cars. There have been isolated cases of fraud associated with ballot harvesting, including in a North Carolina congressional race in 2018. But Trump is wrong to suggest that such fraud is rampant.  Trump has repeatedly suggested that the increase in voting by mail will lead to fraud. But fraud is statistically rare, including in states that have relied on voting by mail for years. A Washington Post analysis of three mail-in states found that ""officials identified just 372 possible cases of double voting or voting on behalf of deceased people out of about 14.6 million votes cast by mail in the 2016 and 2018 general elections, or 0.0025 percent."" We looked at the conservative Heritage Foundation’s voter fraud database, which has recorded 1,296 proven instances of voter fraud. The database includes cases that stretch back decades, covering hundreds of millions of votes cast.   RELATED: Donald Trump’s dubious claim that 'thousands' are conspiring on mail-ballot fraud Trump said election officials are ""sending 80 million ballots all over the country. Eighty million ballots, non-requested. I call them ‘unsolicited ballots.’"" The Trump campaign didn’t respond to our request to explain how he arrived at the 80 million figure. A New York Times analysis in August found that about 44 million voters will receive ballots in states that are automatically sending them to all voters. Our own research and interviews with other election experts and state officials back up the Times’ number. But even that number of 44 million includes voters who would have requested an absentee ballot anyway.  We won’t yet know a more precise figure of how many voters are getting ballots automatically until voter registration is closed in the states. But as of now, the data suggests that Trump exaggerated. We rate his claim Mostly False.   ",[<zip object at 0x00000280973F4CC0>],/factchecks/2020/sep/10/donald-trump/trumps-misleading-claim-about-unsolicited-mail-bal/

COVID-19 tests did not exist in 2018

It shows a list of products described as ""COVID-19 diagnostic test instruments and apparatus"" next to the countries that export them. But the year of those exports, 2018, predates the coronavirus. ""Hello!! Is anyone paying attention?"" reads red text over the screenshot. ""People wonder why we question s---,"" the poster wrote in a caption. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) (Screenshot from Facebook) Similar posts have been shared thousands of times, including by Ben Swann, a former television news reporter with a history of making false claims. The rumor appears to have originated on 4chan, a fringe internet platform. We’ve previously fact-checked misinformation that suggests the coronavirus was planned or manipulated, but we wanted to look into this list of exports. We reached out to the original poster for their evidence, but we haven’t heard back. The table cited in the post is real, but it does not show exports of COVID-19 tests in 2018. The table has been updated to clarify that the page refers to medical devices that weren’t specifically designed for the coronavirus. Several other fact-checkers have debunked Facebook posts that misconstrue the data. First, let’s take a closer look at the portal, which is called World Integrated Trade Solution (WITS). The World Bank maintains the portal in partnership with the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development. The website offers a compilation of trade and tariff data from different UN divisions and other international organizations, such as the World Trade Organization. It allows users to search for things like the top products exported by certain countries. The table shown in the Facebook post lists the top exporters of ""instruments used in clinical laboratories for in vitro diagnosis"" and ""colorimetric end tidal CO2 detectors,"" which is the scientific name for a carbon dioxide detector. CO2 detectors help doctors monitor intubated patients.  Both of those things existed prior to the coronavirus pandemic. So why was the table previously billed as a list of ""COVID-19 Diagnostic Test"" exporters?  It has to do with guidance from the World Health Organization and a related database. In April, the WHO and the World Customs Organization classified CO2 detectors and diagnostic testing equipment, along with hand sanitizer and surgical masks, as critical to fighting COVID-19. Both received the same WCO code — ""902780"" in the Facebook post. COVID-19 test kits were assigned two different codes. The WHO gave some products less technical, coronavirus-related descriptions to make them easier to track. But the broad classification, which was applied to some testing equipment that predated COVID-19, carried over to a WITS database of products related to the virus. RELATED: No, the CDC did not ‘quietly adjust’ US coronavirus deaths ""The WITS team created a special database using the WCO list (along with the new WHO/WCO labels/descriptions),"" the World Bank said in a Sept. 8 statement. ""The goal was to put information about key COVID-related medical supplies in one easy-to-find place."" That resulted in what many Facebook users are confused about: a list of export data about diagnostic testing instruments that appear to predate the coronavirus. The World Bank has since revised the title of the table to read: ""Medical Diagnostic Test instruments and apparatus."" ""In light of misinterpretations that have occurred in recent days, the labeling in the WITS site has been updated to reflect the reality: COVID-19 tests did not exist before 2020,"" the organization said in its statement.

Spanberger has voted with Pelosi a relatively low 92% of the time
","Speaker Nancy Pelosi isn’t  on the ballot in Virginia’s 7th Congressional District, but her name is ever present in this fall’s closely-watched race between Democratic incumbent Abigail Spanberger and Republican Nick Freitas. Freitas, a state legislator, has repeatedly accused Spanberger of breaking a 2018 promise to shun partisanship, and says she’s become a Pelosi loyalist ""She’s voted with Nancy Pelosi over 90% of the time…"" he said during a Sept. 4 interview on Newsradio WRVA in Richmond. We fact checked that statistic, which also is being cited on a TV ad sponsored by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a conservative super PAC. The source of the statistic is ProPublica, a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative news service based in New York. Its data shows Spanberger and Pelosi agreed on 92% of the votes they both cast in this Congress, which began at the start of 2019. There are a few things to keep in mind about this statistic. First, majority parties vote overwhelmingly with the speaker, whom they elect. Spanberger is one of the least loyal Democrats to Pelosi. There are 232 Democrats in the House, and only 10 have voted in greater opposition to Pelosi than Spanberger. More than half of the Democrats - 133 in total -  have agreed with Pelosi every time she’s voted this Congress. Even the most contrary Democrat - Collin Peterson of Minnesota - has voted with her 81%  of the time.  Also keep in mind that speakers vote at their discretion, which means they usually vote only on the most partisanly-charged issues. The votes Pelosi has participated in 9% of the House votes this session. That’s 74 votes, and Spanberger has agreed with her 68 times. They’ve been in sync on most major issues, including: Of their six disagreeing votes, three concerned the Heroes Act - a $3 trillion tax cut and spending bill the House approved in May to spur the COVID-19 economy. Pelosi supported it. Spanberger voted against it, saying it was bloated with Democratic wish-list items. The bill is stalled in the Senate. Spanberger voted against a budget deal last year that Pelosi negotiated, saying it would greatly enlarge the national debt. They also disagreed on a bill that would ban the manufacture and sale of flavored e-cigarettes and menthol cigarettes, which Spanberger opposed; and an amendment that would require customs official to be notified when an undocumented alien tries to buy a gun, which Spanberger backed.  It should be noted that Spanberger didn’t support Pelosi’s election as speaker at the start of 2019 - an action not counted in ProPublica’s database. But even if it had been included, Spanberger would remain above the 90% level Freitas set for agreeing with the speaker.  We should also note that Republicans are criticizing their opponents’ voting percentage with Pelosi in key races across the country. That includes Virginia’s 2nd Congressional District race, where Rep. Elaine Luria, a Democrat, is being challenged by Republican Scott Taylor. Our ruling Freitas says Spanberger has voted with Nancy Pelosi over 90% of the time."" Let’s remember that only 10 Democrats voted against Pelosi more often than Spanberger. But Freitas' statistic is solid; Spanberger and Pelosi agreed on 92 percent of the votes they both participated in.

Trump oversells crediting White House response for falling COVID-19 fatality statistic
","Seeking to counter the notion that the United States has failed to make progress against the  novel coronavirus, President Donald Trump offered a positive statistic during a Sep. 7 news conference. ""Under Operation Warp Speed, we’ve pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 percent since April,"" Trump said. ""You don’t hear that from the press very often.  They don’t like to talk about that. So the fatality rate, 85% — think of that — since April."" When we asked the White House for supporting evidence, they provided the following chart, which they said was compiled by Stanford University School of Medicine professor Jay Bhattacharya. The time frame is somewhat different from what Trump cited, but the trend line is roughly the same.  The chart shows the case-fatality rate for coronavirus between mid-March and mid-July. That statistic refers to the number of coronavirus deaths divided by the number of known coronavirus cases — effectively, the likelihood that you will die from coronavirus if you are known to have been infected. (The data adjusts for the typical lag time between infection and death by pairing the infection data with the death data from two weeks later.) According to the White House’s chart, close to one-third of people who were infected in mid-March ended up dying from the virus. By late April, that rate had fallen to 5%. That’s roughly an 85% decline. (The statistic does not take into account specific risk factors for the disease that an individual may have, and instead looks at the population as a whole. So a person with risk factors may have a greater likelihood of dying, while one without risk factors would have a smaller likelihood.) Bhattacharya told PolitiFact that the chart shows ""a very sharp drop in the case fatality rate from COVID-19 infection in the U.S. since the beginning of the epidemic — people are more likely to survive after infection than they were. It seems very important to me for the public to understand that the lethality of the infection is not what it was when impressions first formed in March. The experience of the Northeast with the epidemic in those early days is atypical of the experience of people infected now."" However, Trump’s focus on this one data point also needs some additional context. The reasons for the drop are not entirely from improved therapies, and Operation Warp Speed, the administration’s effort to devise countermeasures against the virus, doesn’t necessarily get the credit for the drop. Part of the decline likely stems from reasons other than better treatments, said Tara C. Smith, a professor of Epidemiology at Kent State University’s College of Public Health. One factor is testing. Early on, due in part to shortages in testing equipment, only individuals with significant symptoms were being tested, and those patients would be likelier to end up with a fatal case. Later on, Smith said, testing was catching more individuals with mild symptoms or even no symptoms at all, which helped decrease the case-fatality rate. To make this concrete, in March 19, as the case-fatality rate was peaking, 27,974 tests were taken nationally, according to data from the COVID Tracking Project. By April 27, the number was 196,080 — a seven-fold increase. By then, the case-fatality rate had fallen significantly. The rate fell further by July 22, when the number of tests had risen to 796,439. ""Since the denominator of case-fatality is the number of cases detected, the availability of testing and testing practices is a huge driver of the case fatality,"" said Brooke Nichols, an infectious disease mathematical modeler at the Boston University School of Public Health. It is worth noting that the Trump administration has touted its role in expanded testing. But had the same level of testing been in place earlier in the epidemic, the figures on this chart may not have shown the same level of fatality rate decline. In addition, the coronavirus was especially deadly to residents in nursing homes early in the pandemic. That coincided with the period of when testing was limited, probably exaggerating the case-fatality rate. Later in the pandemic, nursing homes implemented stronger protections. Better treatments have helped as well, experts said, including improvements from trial and error in how to treat hospitalized patients, and from additional knowledge gained about what had been an entirely unknown virus just months earlier. The White House told PolitiFact that it considers such improvements the key to the U.S. having a better case-fatality ratio than some other countries, such as the United Kingdom, Italy, and France. Sometimes these improvements have stemmed from things like ventilator use or better positioning of patients on their hospital bed. In other cases, they have come from the use of drugs, such as an existing steroid known as dexamethasone and experimental drugs such as remdesivir, Bhattacharya said. ""Teasing apart exactly how much each treatment advance has mattered is still the subject of scientific work,"" he said. Smith said she expects pharmaceutical advances to eventually be shown to be ""a much smaller piece of the pie"" than the other factors, such as the scope of testing and the age range of those likely to be tested. Meanwhile, it’s doubtful that Operation Warp Speed played much of a role in the decline Trump was referencing. The administration-designed effort, run by the Department of Health and Human Services, does focus to an extent on therapeutics, but its primary goal is to deliver 300 million doses of a safe and effective vaccine by January 2021. More to the point, Operation Warp Speed only announced its scope and leadership on May 15, and by that time, the case-fatality rate had already fallen most of the way from its peak. Finally, it’s worth noting that case-fatality rate is not the only relevant statistic — and many of the other ones are less flattering to the administration. Here’s a chart comparing the decline of the case-fatality rate against daily deaths from coronavirus. (The data we used, from the COVID Tracking Project, was different than what was used in the White House chart, but it shows the same overall pattern.)   As the chart shows, having a low case-fatality rate is no guarantee of protection against a surge in deaths. Even though the case fatality rate has been lower than ever in recent weeks, deaths have settled into roughly 1,000 a day, far more daily deaths than when the case-fatality rate was much higher. Trump said, ""Under Operation Warp Speed, we’ve pioneered groundbreaking therapies, reducing the fatality rate 85 percent since April."" The decline in the case-fatality rate from an earlier phase in the epidemic is real and notable, but ""groundbreaking therapies"" are only part of the reason.  When the rate was peaking, it was a period when relatively few Americans were being tested, and when a sizable percentage of those being tested were those who were more seriously ill, including nursing home residents. In the meantime, by the time Operation Warp Speed had announced its scope and leadership, most of the decline in the case-fatality rate had already occurred.  We rate the statement Half True.",[<zip object at 0x000002809770BE40>],/factchecks/2020/sep/09/donald-trump/Trump-oversells-crediting-White-House-response/

McEnany says Trump never downplayed the virus. He did, and Woodward’s tape explains why
","Confronted with a recording of President Donald Trump from mid March saying that he minimized the coronavirus in public, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the opposite was true. ""The president never downplayed the virus,"" she said in a White House press briefing Sept. 9. McEnany was responding to the release of recorded interviews from investigative reporter Bob Woodward’s new book about Trump entitled ""Rage."" The audio posted by the Washington Post shows Trump explaining to Woodward why his message about the virus shifted between January and March. ""To be honest with you, I wanted to always play it down,"" Trump said March 19. ""I still like playing it down, because I don’t want to create a panic."" McEnany said Trump never lied to the American people.  ""He was expressing calm, and he was taking early action, and his actions are reflective of how seriously he took it,"" she said. We tracked Trump’s responses as the pandemic unfolded. Between January and mid March, Trump consistently minimized the threat posed by the virus. He would talk about the handful of cases in the country and compare them with the more than 25,000 deaths caused by seasonal flu. He said the country had gotten ""lucky."" Here are some key moments in the early months of the pandemic that show him downplaying the threat. On Jan. 24, Trump tweeted his thanks to China for working to contain the virus. ""It will all work out well,"" he wrote.  China has been working very hard to contain the Coronavirus. The United States greatly appreciates their efforts and transparency. It will all work out well. In particular, on behalf of the American People, I want to thank President Xi! On Jan. 30, Trump announced restrictions on travel from China. That night, he told supporters at a campaign rally in Iowa, ""We think we have it very well under control. We have very little problem in this country at this moment — five. ... We think it’s going to have a very good ending for it."" On Feb. 2, he told Fox News host Sean Hannity, ""We pretty much shut it down coming in from China.""  On Feb. 14, in a meeting with members of the Border Patrol Council, he remained reassuring. ""We have a very small number of people in the country, right now, with it. It’s like around 12. Many of them are getting better. Some are fully recovered already. So we’re in very good shape."" On Feb. 24, Trump asked Congress for $1.25 billion in emergency aid. The same day he tweeted that the virus ""is very much under control"" and the stock market was ""starting to look very good to me!""  The Coronavirus is very much under control in the USA. We are in contact with everyone and all relevant countries. CDC & World Health have been working hard and very smart. Stock Market starting to look very good to me! As late as March 9, Trump tweeted out blame to the media and the Democrats for trying to ""inflame"" the situation ""far beyond what the facts would warrant."" He cited the U.S. surgeon general as saying, ""The risk is low to the average American."" The Fake News Media and their partner, the Democrat Party, is doing everything within its semi-considerable power (it used to be greater!) to inflame the CoronaVirus situation, far beyond what the facts would warrant. Surgeon General, “The risk is low to the average American.” Over the next few days, the situation changed rapidly. The World Health Organization officially designated the virus as a pandemic. Trump banned most non-Americans arriving from Europe. He declared a state of emergency.  On March 17, Trump said in a news conference that for the next 14 days, ""we’re asking everyone to work at home, if possible, postpone unnecessary travel, and limit social gatherings to no more than 10 people."" At the news conference, Trump said there was no shift in tone from the White House: ""I've always known this is a real, this is a pandemic. I've felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic."" We rated that claim Pants on Fire because whatever he may have known at the time, his words up to that point did not reflect the threat of a pandemic. Two days after that, he spoke to Woodward about why he downplayed the virus earlier and why he wanted to continue to downplay it. McEnany said Trump never downplayed the virus.  The record shows she’s wrong. During the early months of the coronavirus outbreak, Trump said the country was in very good shape and blamed Democrats and the media for trying to inflame the situation beyond what the facts would warrant.  In the very tape that McEnany was asked about, Trump said he downplayed the virus to avoid creating panic. McEnany spun that as him showing leadership to calm a worried nation. The reasons Trump said what he said aren’t part of this fact-check. Trump’s words are. And they give zero support to McEnany’s statement.

No link between seized fake IDs and voter fraud
","As the election nears, pundits and politicians — including the president himself— have raised concerns about voter fraud. These concerns have been largely unsubstantiated.  But that hasn’t stopped claims about potential voter fraud schemes from spreading on social media. ""Feds Seize 19,888 Fake State Driver Licenses (Made in China) in Chicago O'Hare Airport,"" read one Aug. 26 post shared thousands of times. ""ALL Registered to Vote -- ALL Demorats!""  The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Yes, nearly 20,000 fake driver’s licenses were seized at O’Hare in the first half of the year, but the post was misleading in suggesting that they are all linked to registered voters who are Democrats. There’s no hint of any connection between the confiscated fake IDs and Democrats or voter fraud.  The poster acknowledged this in a revised post, which appeared soon after PolitiFact reached out to the Facebook user for evidence to support the claim. The current post no longer mentions registered voters or Democrats and instead says, ""Not Linked To Voter Fraud, But, What If.""  We were curious about the ""what if"" claim in the revised post, so we looked into how or even whether it would be possible to use a fake driver’s license to perpetrate any kind of voter fraud. Meanwhile, versions of the post with the original wording still appeared and circulated widely on Facebook with unsubstantiated suggestions of a foreign plot to aid Democrats using fake IDs.  From Jan. 1 to June 30, 2020, U.S. Customs and Border Protection officers found thousands of counterfeit driver’s licenses at the Chicago O’Hare International Airport’s international mail facility.  Officers seized a total of 19,888 fake driver’s licenses, according to a July 27 Customs press release. The release didn’t say where the IDs were made, but said they came on shipments mostly from China and Hong Kong, as well as South Korea and Britain. Most were headed to people in states near Illinois, and most were for college-age students. The press release warns that the counterfeit IDs can be used for a wide range of criminal activity, but does not mention voter fraud. The fraudulent identity documents can lead to problems with ""identity theft, worksite enforcement, critical infrastructure protection, fraud linked to immigration-related crimes such as human smuggling and human trafficking,"" reads the press release. ""And these documents can be used by those individuals associated with terrorism to minimize scrutiny from travel screening measures."" Claims that these fake driver’s licenses were tied to voter fraud efforts on behalf of Democrats appear to originate from a warning in a blog post, although there is no evidence to support the claims. Other fact-checking organizations have debunked the blog’s claims. Moreover, it’s unlikely that fake IDs could be used to commit voter fraud. Except for North Dakota, every state requires citizens to register to vote before they can cast a ballot, according to USA.gov, an official federal government information site. (North Dakota keeps rolls of past voters and checks IDs at polling places.) In many states, people can register to vote at a local election office, online, at a motor-vehicle agency office or using the national mail voter registration form.  While every state sets its own voter registration laws, many require some form of identification, proof of residence or the last four digits of a real Social Security number when registering. That information is then checked against the state’s own databases. In many states, for example, online voter registration only works for people who already have an official state-issued identification of some kind, because of how the registration is validated, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. ""That validation step is done by comparing the information on the online registration form against the information provided by the same individual when he or she received a driver’s license or other state-issued identification card,"" the website says. ""When the information does not match, the application is sent to officials for further review or action."" If the information on a counterfeit driver’s license doesn’t match the information the person provided when getting their real state-issued ID, then the fake ID couldn’t be used to register to vote. The Customs press release included a picture of a counterfeit Michigan driver’s license among the seized IDs, and said ""the bar code attached to the Michigan licenses worked."" So PolitiFact reached out to Michigan’s secretary of state about the voter fraud concern. A spokesperson for the Michigan secretary of state’s office said in an email that a driver’s license or state ID is not required to register to vote in Michigan, so a fake ID wouldn’t help. But voters who do have an official Michigan ID provide that information when they register to vote, she said.   ""The local clerk’s office has many avenues to validate a person, up to and including contacting the Department of State to verify a person’s photograph and ID/Driver’s License Record number,"" she said. The spokesperson also said she was not aware of any coordinated effort to commit voter fraud using counterfeit IDs and said there were fail-safes in place to catch those trying to use fraudulent IDs when registering to vote. A Facebook post claims, ""Feds Seize 19,888 Fake State Driver Licenses (Made in China) in Chicago O'Hare Airport - ALL Registered to Vote -- ALL Demorats!"" About 20,000 counterfeit driver’s licenses were confiscated at the Chicago O’Hare International Airport in the first half of 2020. But there is no evidence that the IDs were all for registered voters or Democrats or had anything to do with voter fraud, as the post suggests. The Facebook user acknowledged that in a revised post. And state registration practices make it unlikely that fake IDs could be used fraudulently to vote or register to vote.  We rate this post False.",[<zip object at 0x00000280FFCB6980>],/factchecks/2020/sep/09/facebook-posts/no-link-between-seized-fake-ids-and-voter-fraud/

Post wrongly says thousands of ballots sent to dead people, pets in Virginia and Nevada
","A false Facebook post states that two battleground states sent huge numbers of ballots to dead people and pets. ""Why isn’t anyone mentioning over 500,000 mail in ballots found in Virginia and 200,000 in Nevada in dead peoples names and pets,"" stated an Aug. 10 Facebook post shared thousands of times. This post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post twists two news stories. One was a story out of Virginia about mail ballot applications for the Nov. 3 election. And the second was a story out of Nevada about mail ballots sent during the June 9 Nevada primary. Neither state has sent ballots to voters for the Nov. 3 general election and in neither case was there evidence of thousands of ballots being sent to dead people and pets. The claim about Virginia stems from mailings from the Center for Voter Information, a national voter registration group that describes itself as nonpartisan but was started by a Democratic strategist.  In August, the group sent absentee ballot request applications to 2.2 million voters in Virginia, including about 500,000 that had return envelopes addressed to the wrong elections offices. The group, which is a partner of the Voter Participation Center, apologized for providing wrong information, and its printer took responsibility. The group said that the error stemmed from confusing some cities and counties with similar names. Election officials around the country have said that the center’s mailings have created confusion, but the group defended its work saying it encouraged voting. Virginia elections officials said they had nothing to do with the center’s mailing and encouraged voters who want to receive ballots to apply on the state’s website. So, how did the inaccurate mailings lead to false posts that claim the 500,000 were sent to ""dead people’s names and pets""? Deb Wake, president of the League of Women Voters of Virginia, told DC-area news radio station WTOP-FM 103.5: ""One person stated that a dead person received one and a pet received one.""  Wake told PolitiFact that she regrets sharing that anecdote. She said she based her comments on something she’d heard from a league member who said she had a friend who received one ballot application for a pet and dead relative. President Donald Trump chimed in as well: ""Half a million incorrect absentee ballot applications were sent all across the state of Virginia, including to many dead people…,"" Trump said during a briefing with reporters Aug. 10. ""They had some sent to pets — dogs."" RELATED: Will 458,000 Vote-By-Mail Ballots Go To Californians Who Have Died Or Moved? Experts Are Skeptical Due to the pandemic, Nevada passed a law to send mail ballots to all active voters. In advance of the June 9 primary, Clark County sent out about 1.3 million ballots. The county, which includes Las Vegas and is the largest in the state, mailed the ballots to addresses provided by voters when they registered. About 226,000 ballots were returned to elections officials because the voters no longer lived there, said Dan Kulin, a spokesperson for the Clark County Election Department. ""This is a common way for us to discover someone has moved,"" Kulin said. But the fact that they were returned is not evidence that all of the people had died — nor is it evidence of fraud. In fact, it is a sign that the system worked as designed. Postal workers are not allowed to forward ballots if they have a forwarding address — they are required to return them, said Wayne Thorley, deputy secretary of state for elections. The state elections office receives daily death data from the state’s vital statistics office. It also gets death data every other month from the Social Security Administration. The state then passes along the data to the counties so that they can remove dead voters from their registration lists. There can be a time lag in updating the rolls. ""If we print the ballot today and a voter dies tomorrow that’s going to get mailed to them,"" Thorley said. ""The voter roll is constantly in flux. You take a snapshot right now, and in 5 minutes it is out of date because somebody moved or passed away."" It’s possible that anecdotal reports fueled misinformation. A long time postal worker, Jenny Trobiani, told the Las Vegas Review Journal in May that she had never seen such an influx of undeliverable ballots. ""(The recipients) had all moved or died,"" Trobiani said.  The fact that dead people remain on voter rolls nationwide does not itself equal fraud — it’s only a crime if someone then fills out a ballot in the name of a dead voter and sends it in.  The likelihood that voter fraud can happen because of dead people on the rolls is very low, said Thessalia Merivaki, an expert on voter administration and political science professor at Mississippi State University.  ""Election administrators verify a lot of information prior to processing a ballot, be it by mail or in person …,"" Merivaki said. ""The same applies for voter registration. All information is verified, so it is highly unlikely that dead people can register to vote."" States have significantly improved keeping their registration records up to date by joining the national Electronic Registration Information Center, which sends reports to member states showing when voters have moved within their state or out of state, when they have died and flagging when they may have duplicate registrations.  Facebook posts said more than 500,000 mail in ballots in Virginia and 200,000 in Nevada were sent to dead people or pets. In Virginia, about 500,000 voters received an application for a ballot — not an actual ballot — that included the wrong return address for elections offices. In Nevada, around 226,000 ballots for the primary were returned to Clark County because the voters didn’t live at the address.  In neither case, does that add up to evidence that hundreds of thousands of dead people and pets received ballots. We rate this claim False. ",[<zip object at 0x000002809A331D00>],/factchecks/2020/sep/09/facebook-posts/post-wrongly-says-thousands-ballots-sent-dead-peop/
