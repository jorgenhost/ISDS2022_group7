Marco Rubio tweets that GOP didn't support Social Security changes
","
The fiscal cliff negotiations are now over, but while they were happening, there were lots of accusations and finger-pointing.

President Barack Obama and Senate Republicans finally struck a deal early in the morning on New Year’s Day to avoid going over the fiscal cliff, with senators voting 89-8 in favor. But a much-talked about Florida senator with presidential aspirations voted no: Marco Rubio.

Amid home stretch negotiations, Rubio took to the online messaging service Twitter to tell people what was happening. On the afternoon of Sunday, Dec. 30, he tweeted: ""Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false. BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama.""

The next day, liberal columnist Paul Krugman said Rubio lied about the negotiations, and that ""numerous reports tell us that McConnell did in fact make precisely that demand,"" referring to the Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky.

Krugman concluded that Rubio’s words revealed that a ""grand bargain"" between the two parties just won’t work: ""You can’t make big deals with a totally untrustworthy negotiating partner,"" he said.

We decided to sort out the controversy by investigating Rubio’s claim that the GOP did not insist on changes to Social Security as part of the fiscal cliff, and whether Obama actually supported those changes.

Chained CPI

The final days of fiscal cliff negotiations hit a roadblock amid a controversy about something called ""chained CPI,"" which would reduce future spending on Social Security for seniors.

Most years, seniors get cost-of-living adjustments that slightly increase their monthly Social Security payments. If chained CPI were adopted, the increases would be smaller.

What is chained CPI? The CPI stands for ""consumer price index,"" and it would be a new method for calculating cost-of-living increases for Social Security. Chained CPI accounts for how people change their behavior when costs go up: So if the price of pasta goes up, you might buy cheaper rice instead.

Supporters of chained CPI say it’s a way to reduce Social Security spending without making major changes to the program. Opponents say it’s essentially a reduction in Social Security payments that hits many seniors who are barely getting by.

Although painful for politicians clamoring for the senior vote, switching to chained CPI has drawn support from many economists and experts. The National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform included the idea in its recommendations. The conservative Heritage Foundation has endorsed chained CPI and the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal think tank, has shown support for it under certain conditions, if it includes a modest benefit increase. 
Obama’s view on chained CPI

Switching to chained CPI isn’t a new concept. The Washington Post reported that Obama ""tentatively embraced"" chained CPI during 2011 negotiations with House Republicans on the debt ceiling.

But many Democrats -- including Sen. Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, and the AARP pushed back. When Obama released his deficit-reduction plan in September 2011 a year before he would face voters, it did not include the change.

But post-election, as Obama wanted to avoid going over the fiscal cliff, he again seemed open to switching inflation measures. In mid-December, Obama reportedly agreed to chained CPI, angering some in his own party.

Obama spoke about his chained CPI proposal on Meet the Press on Dec. 30, noting that it was not popular with Democrats or the AARP: ""But in pursuit of strengthening Social Security for the long-term I'm willing to make those decisions. What I'm not willing to do is to have the entire burden of deficit reduction rest on the shoulders of seniors, making students pay higher student loan rates, ruining our capacity to invest in things like basic research that help our economy grow. Those are the things that I'm not willing to do....""

So Obama supported chained CPI as a concession he was willing to make in order to get Republicans to make concessions on things Obama wanted. (We contacted the White House for additional comment on this point and did not get a response.)

So was chained CPI part of negotiations?

During the final weekend of backroom negotiations on the fiscal cliff, multiple news reports said that Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell included the chained CPI in an offer. The Los Angeles Times wrote that McConnell included it in his proposal on the evening of Saturday, Dec. 29 -- and it appeared to unravel within 24 hours.

The reports we read -- in both liberal and conservative media -- said Democrats were bashing the proposal, while some said Republicans were ""insisting"" or ""demanding"" that chained CPI be included.

At some point Sunday afternoon, though, Republicans dropped their demands for the Social Security change.

The timing of those news reports were around the same time as Rubio’s afternoon tweet. Republicans appeared to be in damage-control mode about the suggestion that they would be reducing grannies’ Social Security checks in favor of lower taxes for the wealthy.

A reporter asked Sen. John McCain why McConnell made the proposal if Republicans were against it. McCain, R-Ariz., responded bluntly: ""Damned if I know.""

McCain said changes to Social Security would be a political loser for Republicans since the deal at hand was mostly about taxes.

""It’s a very bad, losing proposition,"" McCain said. ""What (Democrats) are saying now is, ‘Republicans want to preserve tax breaks for rich people and give up seniors’ Social Security.’ That’s the argument they’re using. Now whether it’s valid or not, it’s a winning argument. It should be off the table. And I think most Republicans believe it should be off the table.""

Rubio’s explanation

Multiple news reports said that McConnell proposed chained CPI but that Republicans revolted and immediately squashed the idea. So why did Rubio tweet that ""Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false""?

Rubio spokesman Alex Conant told PolitiFact in an email: ""Marco’s tweet is 100% true. It was something that Republican leaders had sought, but never insisted on, and it was obviously not part of the final agreement (which Marco voted against because it failed to grow the economy or address spending). I’m honestly surprised that something so obviously true would warrant a fact-check from you guys.""

Our ruling

On Dec. 30, two days before Rubio voted against the fiscal cliff package, he tweeted: ""Report that #GOP insisting on changes to Social Security as part of #fiscalcliff false. BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama.""

Actually, Republicans had asked for the changes earlier in the negotiations, but dropped the demand later when they decided it was a political loser. Rubio’s tweet did not make it clear that GOP leadership did pursue the Social Security change, at least for a time.

Rubio also stated ""BTW those changes are supported by @barackobama."" Obama has shown a willingness to use chained CPI as one ingredient in deficit reduction, though he acknowledges that it isn’t popular with seniors or his own party. Obama has also said it was a concession he was willing to offer as part of a deal where both sides would compromise to reduce the deficit.

Committee chief says Texas government spent more through Medicaid on orthodontia than other states combined
","
A legislator featured at a breakfast during the September 2012 Texas Tribune Festival brought up orthodontia—I know, right?—and made a Texas-sized claim.

Rep. Lois Kolkhorst, R-Brenham, who chairs the House Committee on Public Health, said: ""It’s unacceptable that the state of Texas spent more than all 49"" other ""states combined, according to many, many reports and even our own data."" The claim was heard and relayed to us by University of Texas journalism student Cody Permenter.

Texas, No. 1 in recent Heisman Trophy winners, winter warm spells—and orthodontia?

By email, Kolkhorst’s chief of staff, Chris Steinbach, said Kolkhorst drew on groundbreaking news reports by WFAA-TV, Channel 8 in Dallas, about Medicaid spending on orthodontia, as well as a congressional report published in April 2012.

Since May 2011, the station has presented numerous reports exploring expenditures on what appear to have been many medically unneeded orthodontic procedures provided to children enrolled in Medicaid, the joint federal-state health program.

In the initial May 13, 2011, broadcast, reporter Byron Harris said such expenditures are supposed to be authorized only when a child’s teeth are so crooked they could handicap the child. But, he said, required authorizations submitted by Texas practitioners had been rejected by a state contractor only when paperwork was flawed.

""Under Medicaid, Texas spends far more on braces than any state in the country, more than the next 10 states combined,"" Harris reported. The segment showed Stephanie Goodman, spokeswoman for the Texas Health and Human Services Commission, saying: ""For whatever reason, it’s an area where we’ve had more trouble than other parts of Medicaid.""

Spending was described more dramatically in subsequent WFAA-TV reports, though wordings varied. For instance, a station anchor introduced a June 19, 2011, report by saying Texas ""spent $184 million last year on free braces for kids covered by Medicaid. That’s more than the rest of the country combined."" In an Aug. 18, 2011, report, Harris said  the same Texas spending was ""as much as the rest of the nation combined,"" a characterization repeated in a segment that aired a week later in which he said the state ""now spends as much on braces for poor kids as the other 49 states combined.""

We wondered how the station researched spending in Texas and other states.

By phone, Harris said that he and a producer contacted the states that, with Texas, comprise the nation’s 10 most populous: California, New York, Florida, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Georgia and North Carolina. Harris said letters sent to officials in each state inquired into how much the state had spent in 2010 on orthodontic procedures the station had zeroed in on in Texas.

""Nobody had ever asked for this before,"" Harris said.

Resulting totals, according to a spreadsheet Harris forwarded to us, ranged from zero in Michigan to $1 million for Ohio and up to $19.4 million for California and $20 million for North Carolina. And the nine-state total, $126.7 million, ran well short of the $184 million spent in Texas.

Harris said the station did not research spending in the 40 other states, which would have drained too much time. Instead, he said, ""we just guessed"" at how much the other states spent. He also agreed that such spending in the other 40 states could push the total for all other states over the Texas total. ""It could go either way,"" he said.

Harris later called us back, saying: ""You can shoot our methodology"" per the spending in the 40 other states, though it’s also worth noting that the state of Texas did not make its own comparison. ""The proof is available,"" Harris said. Texas officials ""chose not to go for it.""

The congressional report cited by Steinbach, issued April 25, 2012, by the Republican majority staff of the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, says that ""between 2008 and 2010, Texas’ Medicaid program spent more on orthodontics, particularly braces, than all 49 remaining states combined.""

But that comparison, also quoted in an Aug. 19, 2012, Wall Street Journal news article noted by Kolkhorst, does not appear to have been independently researched. A footnote in the committee staff report credits a Dec. 27, 2011, special report by WFAA, whose online summary of the report says: ""Texas paid more for Medicaid-funded dental orthodontics than the other 49 states combined.""

The congressional report also quotes the then-Texas Medicaid director, Billy Millwee, as saying that because the state was focused on increasing the participation of dentists in Medicaid in accordance with a broad plan resulting from a lawsuit, the state had not noticed the stunning increase in spending on orthodontic services.

In August 2011, the Texas Health and Human Services Commission announced that it was tightening its oversight of requests to pay for orthodontics through Medicaid.

By phone, spokeswoman Goodman told us it’s not known whether Texas spent the same or more on orthodontics than what was spent in other states combined nor was it necessarily the agency's mission to prove or disprove that. She said by email that when state researchers asked the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services about a Texas-to-other-states comparison, they were told it would be difficult to compare states because of the different ways state Medicaid programs address orthodontic services. At the federal agency, spokesman Alper Ozinal told us state-specific figures for 2010 Medicaid spending on orthodontic procedures were not yet compiled.

Goodman told us: ""No doubt, there have been problems with orthodontic services and we paid for claims that didn’t meet the criteria for medical necessity,"" but significantly, she said by email, the state also ensured that more needy children received basic dental services. She sent a chart showing that Medicaid spending on orthodontic procedures escalated more than 200 percent from nearly $73 million in 2006 to $249 million five years later. Medicaid expenditures on other dental procedures in Texas increased at a faster clip--300 percent, from nearly $297 million to nearly $1.2 billion, according to the chart.

Goodman noted, too, that in March 2012, the state shifted from a fee-for-service approach to Medicaid-funded dental services to a managed-care approach, a move that put the financial risk of providing services on contractors rather than the state.

According to an Oct. 15, 2012, commission presentation, ""there has been a significant decrease in the number of orthodontic prior authorization requests and approvals"" since implementation of the managed-care method. Also, the presentation says, the commission’s inspector general had identified more than 50 probable ""over-utilizers"" of orthodontic services and identified $229 million in potential overpayments with 26 orthodontic providers placed on payment hold based on credible fraud allegations.

Kolkhorst said her reference at the Tribune event to ""our own data"" reflected efforts by House aides to check spending in some other states. She emailed us what she described as her handwritten notes suggesting that 14 other states, combined, spent nearly $150 million on such procedures, about $35 million less than Texas alone. The notes show totals for the nine states separately checked by WFAA plus Arkansas, Colorado, Wyoming and Alabama and Hawaii, both shown as spending nothing on the procedures.

""Without us actually calling all 50 states and adding it all up, which we could do, I am very confident ... that Texas spent in the ballpark of the 49 other states,"" Kolkhorst said. ""It could be within $1 million or $10 million—the point being"" that what Texas spent by itself was ""incredible.""

Kolkhorst said that if WFAA had said Texas solely outspent the other most-populous states, combined, she would have said that and shouldn’t be penalized for echoing what she believed to be accurate reportage. Otherwise, she said, ""it is now our job to research whatever the media puts out.""

Our ruling

Kolkhorst said that according to ""many reports"" and ""our own data,"" Texas outspent all other states combined on Medicaid-funded orthodontia. 
Texas experienced a toothsome spending spike; WFAA's reporting demonstrates the state spent more on orthodontic procedures funded by Medicaid in 2010 than the other most-populous states, combined. But relevant research has been limited to the spending in Texas and nine to 14 other states. Lacking complete backup information, this claim rates as Half True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/04/lois-kolkhorst/committee-chief-says-texas-government-spent-more-t/

Marcia Fudge claims the fiscal cliff deal included cuts in payments for illness that disproportionately impact minorities
","
If you read about the fiscal-cliff deal Congress made on New Year’s Day, one fact above others stood out. Through compromises -- more unsavory or unprincipled to some than to others --  America’s economy did not topple over.

Neither side got everything it wanted, noted U.S. Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Warrensville Heights Democrat who voted for the deal. One compromise in particular still leaves Fudge uneasy: the funding measures used to keep Medicare from cutting its pay to physicians by 26.5 percent. To avert the physician pay cuts, Congress diverted money from several other medical programs, Fudge said in a Jan. 1 news release.

This took care of the so-called Medicare doc fix -- but it also happened to take money
from programs that pay for ""treating illnesses disproportionately impacting minorities, including end stage renal disease and diabetes,"" Fudge said. She said this must be addressed in the new session of Congress.

Did Congress really get the money to keep paying doctors for treating seniors (via Medicare,) by cutting what it pays hospitals and others for treating diabetes and other diseases? PolitiFact Ohio took a look.
 
It turns out that Fudge, who chairs the Congressional Black Caucus, was correct on the funding. Whether this will harm patients is a matter of debate. Government accountants have wanted some of these changes for some time. Hospitals say the bean counters miss the big picture -- the real cost of treating patients -- by focusing too narrowly on line items.

To understand this, let’s start with a quick explanation of the doc fix. It is a remnant of laws, the most recent in 1997, designed to hold down federal spending by linking the nation’s rate of economic growth to government payments for providers in Medicare, the 1965 program that brought federal health insurance to retirees.

The problem is, medical costs often rise much faster than the overall economy (measured  by the gross domestic product). In recent, low-inflation years, the formula linking the two would automatically require payment cuts to doctors. Some doctors who serve seniors say they might get paid so little that they would stop accepting new patients or quit practicing. So  Congress halts these reductions every year, though it keeps the law.

This year’s cut would have been particularly deep because of the cumulative build-up of past deferrals. But as we said, Congress found a fix. It required coming up with about $30 billion to pay.

Where did the money come from?

According to the Kaiser Health News blog, Congress decided to cut the amount that Medicare pays to hospitals for inpatient or overnight care by reducing annual base payment  increases. This would save $10.5 billion over 10 years, the Kaiser news service said.

Congress found another $4.2 billion by reducing what are known as ‘disproportionate share"" payments made by Medicaid, the government’s program for low-income Americans, to hospitals that treat an unusually high share of the poor.

And it got $4.9 billion by changing the way it bundles payments for treating end-stage renal disease starting in 2014

There are other changes, including a requirement that companies start competing with bids to sell diabetes test supplies, ending what government auditors say are over-payments. But you get the idea. These and other cuts are detailed in reports by the medical trade press, including The Medicare NewsGroup and Becker’s Hospital Review.

If this sounds like Congress took from Peter to pay Paul, the president and CEO of the Federation of American Hospitals, Chip Kahn, might agree. He put it that way to Kaiser Health News: ""It is not in the best interest of patients or those who care for them to rob hospital Peter to pay for fiscal cliff Paul.""

The American Medical Association also expressed its concerns.

Outrageous? Consider the rationale: Congressional watchdogs maintain these programs were overpaid or abused in the past, and could function in the future with less money.

According to several studies and audits by the Government Accountability Office, an investigative agency that reports to Congress, hospitals were overpaid while Medicare transitioned toward paying them a bundled sum for treatment based on a patient’s disease or diagnosis. The old system paid for individual services, treatments and tests, some of them poorly coordinated and duplicative. Overpayments occurred during the transition that started in 2008.

Additionally, some ambulance services were overpaid for emergency transport of diabetes patients who did not need emergency or ambulance services, according to examinations by the inspector general for the Department of Health and Human Services. By cutting such payments by 10 percent, starting next October, Congress freed up additional money for the doc fix.

And the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services paid for more dialysis-related drugs -- as much as $880 million in 2011 -- than patients with kidney failure actually used, according to a December, 2012, GAO report. This was due to a bundled-payment calculation that did not account for a significant drop in the usage of certain drugs -- 23 percent lower in 2011 than in 2007, the GAO found.

The GAO specifically recommended that Congress tweak the law so CMS had clear authority to alter its dialysis payment calculations. Congress did so as part of the fiscal cliff and doc fix deal.

But the medical industry is unhappy about this and the other cuts. It says that the GAO failed to factor in costs for which it is never reimbursed.

""Making cuts of the magnitude GAO is recommending would impose great financial strain"" on smaller dialysis organizations ""and could lead to fewer choices and access to care problems for patients,"" Katrina Russell, president of the National Renal Administrators Association, told American Medical News in December.

Fudge, too, does not like this change. Her district not only includes every major hospital system in Cuyahoga County, as her communications director, Belinda Prinz, told us, but also has a significant black population. African-Americans have a disproportionately high incidence of diabetes and are 1.8 times more likely to have diabetes than non-Hispanic whites, according to the American Diabetes Association.

One in four African-American women over age 55 has diabetes, Prinz said in an email, citing this and other American Diabetes Association figures. Complications can cause blindness, kidney disease, heart attacks and strokes, and amputations sometimes result -- with African-Americans 2.7 times as likely to have lower-limb amputations, the association says.

So where does that leave us with Fudge’s claim?

Fudge did not specifically say minorities will be harmed by the spending cuts. Her statement was factually accurate. But she suggested that harm will result, saying that cuts will be made to programs that treat diseases disproportionately affecting minorities, including end stage renal disease and diabetes.""

The impact is unsettled for now. The GAO and inspector general have called out some of these programs for waste or unnecessary spending. Yet Fudge is in good company -- namely, the American medical community, although like any constituency, it too has its interests to protect.

Because her claim requires this additional information to fully understand, we rate it Mostly True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/04/marcia-fudge/marcia-fudge-claims-fiscal-cliff-deal-included-cut/

Deal makes premature claim on Falcons stadium bid
","
The public may be wary, but key elected officials are warming up to the idea of helping the Atlanta Falcons build a new stadium for the low, low price of $1 billion.

Taxpayers would help finance a projected $300 million to construct the retractable-roof colossus, but boosters say the burden is smaller than it seems.  A cautious Gov. Nathan Deal recently told WSB-TV reporter Lori Geary that the plan could make fiscal sense.

""I think that, overall, if we get a new facility that’s upgraded and meets the current demands and needs of the future, then being ‘on the hook,’ so to speak, for less than a third – that is repaid from money that comes from outsiders – I think that’s probably a pretty good deal,"" the governor said.

There’s got to be a catch, right?

A stadium can cost more than the price of on-site construction.  Off-site roads, bridges and other infrastructure may need upgrades to accommodate crowds.  

Looks like it’s time for the Truth-O-Meter.

If the Falcons get their wish, the 20-year-old Georgia Dome would be razed in favor of a facility with luxury suites and other features that could boost the team’s bottom line.  

Skeptical taxpayers stand in their way. The public fully financed the Dome. But in the decades since, voters have soured on helping sports teams build new arenas.

Under the current proposal, they would pitch in big time.

The facility would be owned by the Georgia World Congress Center Authority, which owns the Dome, the Georgia World Congress Center and Centennial Olympic Park.  Each year, a portion of the  budgets for the Dome and World Congress Center come from a cut of an 8 percent tax on hotel and motel rooms within Atlanta’s city limits and unincorporated Fulton County.

The GWCCA would help the Falcons pay for stadium construction with a bond backed by revenue it expects this tax to make over the next 30 years.  The projected amount: about $300 million.  

We emailed Deal spokesman Brian Robinson for more information. He said the governor was speaking about the burden the stadium would put on state funds, and Deal overstated the cost.

""In reality, it would come at no cost to STATE taxpayers,"" Robinson responded.  

We think viewers may have gotten the impression that Deal  was talking about the total burden to taxpayers. The financing the governor mentioned in the interview would be backed by the local hotel/motel tax, not state funds.

We’ll take both interpretations into account.

This brings us to the first part of our fact check. Are taxpayers ""on the hook ... for less than a third"" of the stadium’s cost?  

This appears to be a matter of arithmetic. The $300 million contribution from local motel/hotel taxes is  less than one-third of the projected $1 billion construction cost.  

If this were the only pot of public funds going to the stadium, then this portion of Deal’s claim would be correct.  But there’s more to the story.

In a ""term sheet"" approved in December that outlines the deal, both parties agreed that the GWCCA would buy land for the facility.

Deal earmarked $15 million from the state budget in 2012 to buy land that could be used for the complex. Land acquisition costs could rise depending on which site planners select.

In addition, roads and other infrastructure near the stadium may need hundreds of millions of dollars in upgrades. Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed said in September that these improvements could push the stadium’s total cost to $1.2 billion. This could push the cost to the public upward of $500 million.

The Falcons expect to seek government help.  The term sheet says that the GWCCA will cooperate with them ""in pursuing other possible governmental funding sources with respect to such offsite infrastructure as may be required.""

Reed floated the possibility of using an additional $53 million in city economic development dollars.

WXIA-TV recently reported that the stadium could receive millions of dollars in tax breaks from the state through an economic development program for projects of ""regional significance.""

And furthermore, state money that the Georgia Department of Transportation gives local governments for road maintenance could be available, state DOT spokeswoman Jill Goldberg said.  The project may be eligible for federal funds, too.

Goldberg stressed, though, that no plans have been made, and the project may need no state money.

Robinson told PolitiFact Georgia that he did not ""foresee"" state DOT money being used, but there are no set plans.

""There’s too many unknowns at this juncture,"" Robinson said in an email. ""There’s no deal at this time.""

Let’s move on to the second part of Deal’s claim. Will the public’s share of the cost really be paid for by ""outsiders""?

Not entirely. As we mentioned earlier, the GWCCA would use state funds to buy the site, and state, local and federal funds could be used for infrastructure.

But the majority of the projected $300 million in hotel/motel taxes for stadium construction would be paid by outsiders.

Some 86 percent of those who stay in hotels in unincorporated Fulton and the city of Atlanta are from out of state, Atlanta Convention and Visitors Bureau spokeswoman Lauren Jarrell said.

Our ruling:

Regardless of how you interpret Deal’s claim, it fell short.

Yes, a large portion of the public’s contribution would come from local hotel/motel taxes, and these are overwhelmingly paid by ""outsiders.""

But the state will buy land for the stadium, could chip in to help with hundreds of millions in infrastructure costs, and could provide substantial tax breaks.

The total share for taxpayers could  easily exceed $300 million.

Deal’s claim is premature. And it leaves out important details.

Louie Gohmert says George Washington said a free people should be armed to guard against government tyranny
","
Why should ordinary Americans be able to buy semi-automatic weapons designed for the military or law enforcement?

That was ""Fox News Sunday"" host Chris Wallace’s question to U.S. Rep. Louie Gohmert, a Texas Republican, on his Dec. 16, 2012, show, two days after the Newtown, Conn., elementary school massacre.

Gohmert answered in part, ""For the reason George Washington said a free people should be an armed people. It ensures against the tyranny of the government.""

We contacted spokeswomen for Gohmert, seeking details on the Washington quotation, but didn’t hear back.

But a Web search led us to a similar statement that Washington made in the first State of the Union address, Jan. 8, 1790: ""A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.""

Experts told us, though, that Washington was calling for a trained militia to defend the new nation, not anticipating a citizens’ stand against their own government’s tyranny.

The statement comes near the beginning of Washington’s speech:
  
Among the interesting objects, which will engage your attention, that of providing for the common defence will merit particular regard. To be prepared for War is one of the most effectual means of preserving peace. 
A free people ought not only to be armed but disciplined; to which end a uniform and well digested plan is requisite. And their safety and interest require, that they should promote such manufactories, as tend to render them independent on others for essential, particularly for military supplies. 
The proper establishment of the Troops, which may be deemed indispensable, will be entitled to mature deliberation. 

Ron Chernow, whose ""Washington: A Life"" won the 2011 Pulitzer Prize for biography, helped us translate that into 21st-century-ese.

""In this passage, Washington is talking about national defense policy, not individuals arming themselves, and the need for national self-sufficiency in creating military supplies,"" Chernow told us by email.

John Woolley, co-creator of the American Presidency Project at the University of California-Santa Barbara (where we first saw the speech), also said Washington was speaking about external threats and ""not being dependent on imported weapons.""

""He said that as a practical matter, the young and vulnerable USA needed to be prepared to mount an effective defense against other"" nations, Woolley told us by email. The Senate and House both issued formal responses, Woolley said, and ""there is no hint in either of these that the members of Congress thought there was something in that speech about gun rights.""

Washington’s address goes on to say that peaceful measures having failed in regards to ""certain tribes of hostile Indians"" on the southern and western frontiers, ""we ought to be prepared to afford protection to those parts of the Union.""

The ""common defence,"" being prepared for war and having the ability to protect against hostile tribes all refer to outside threats.

Edward Lengel, editor in chief of the Papers of George Washington project at the University of Virginia, told us by email, ""Washington never said, to my knowledge, anything about arms providing a safeguard against any so-called ‘tyranny’ of government.’ ""

In reading the ""armed, but disciplined"" quotation, Lengel said, ""emphasis should be on the word ‘disciplined,’ by which Washington was taking a backhanded swipe at the militia, which he considered undisciplined and next to useless in combat. Washington was all for an ordered, professional standing army under the command of a strong central government.""

But an army was expensive, as Washington wrote in a May 2, 1783, memo to a congressional committee that asked for his advice on how to organize the military in peacetime.

""We are too poor to maintain a standing Army adequate to our defence,"" he said, and suggested a small regular army supplemented by a well-organized militia -- a part-time force of volunteers, called up in emergencies. The Militia Acts of 1792 tracked with the memo’s description, calling for white men 18 to 45 years old to be enrolled in a militia. A cost-cutting provision required them to provide their own arms and ammunition.

So there’s evidence that post-Revolutionary lawmakers expected citizens to own firearms. And, Woolley said, some leaders then undoubtedly ""endorsed views like those Mr. Gohmert expresses -- perhaps more precisely, in order to stay free, the people should have the right to be armed.""

Washington, though, does not appear to have been among them.

Lengel said, ""The idea of resistance to tyranny being dependent on a nation of gun-wielding individuals acting at their own behest or even on local initiative would have been anathema to Washington.

""Indeed, during the (Revolutionary) war he very frequently lamented the crimes carried out by armed civilians or undisciplined militia against their unarmed neighbors. The solution to these crimes, as he understood it, was to increase the power of the government and the army to prevent and punish them -- not to put more guns in the hands of civilians.""

Mary Thompson, research historian at Washington’s Virginia home, Mount Vernon, told us via email, ""Washington’s actual quote is in regard to the people serving in the militia as an arm of the government,"" rather than as an armed resistance to government.

In fact, she said, Washington called up militias to put down just such a rebellion a few years later.

During the Whiskey Rebellion in 1794, she said, ""citizens of Western Pennsylvania rose up to fight a new tax on the whiskey they produced."" Washington was ""concerned that success by the rebels would lead to a diminishment of the central/federal government,"" and directed state militias to counter the insurrection -- ""citizen-soldiers,"" she said, ""acting on behalf of the government against their fellow citizens.""

Our ruling

Gohmert’s rendering, ""George Washington said a free people should be an armed people,"" seemingly tracks Washington’s words to the nation: ""A free people ought not only to be armed, but disciplined.""

U.S. Sen. Menendez says $60 billion was approved 10 days after Katrina, but Sandy aid still pending
","Two months after Hurricane Sandy devastated parts of the Garden State, New Jersey officials and residents are still waiting for Congress to sign off on roughly $60 billion in emergency relief aid.

But after Hurricane Katrina pummeled New Orleans in August 2005, it only took 10 days for a similar level of federal aid to be approved for that disaster, according to U.S. Sen. Robert Menendez.

Raising his voice, the New Jersey Democrat offered that comparison during a Dec. 27 speech on the Senate floor in regard to a $60.4 billion aid package for Sandy victims. The Senate approved the package Dec. 28, but the House has delayed action on the funding.

""I want my colleagues to remember that 10 days after Hurricane Katrina, this chamber passed two separate bills amounting to $60 billion,"" Menendez said. ""It has been nearly two months since we had Superstorm Sandy and nothing has passed.""

Menendez is right.

In the 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana, the Republican-controlled Congress approved two bills providing $62.3 billion in emergency funding, and President George W. Bush immediately signed them into law.

In this fact-check, we’re not comparing the levels of damage caused by Katrina and Sandy. Our focus is on the timing of emergency appropriations approved by Congress.

Here’s how the timing breaks down:

Katrina made landfall Aug. 29, 2005, near Buras, La., and continued north toward New Orleans, leaving about 80 percent of the city flooded, according to a report from the National Hurricane Center.

On Sept. 2, 2005, Congress passed a bill to provide $10.5 billion in emergency funding for disaster relief related to Hurricane Katrina. Then, on Sept. 8, 2005, Congress passed another bill for an additional $51.8 billion in emergency appropriations.

So, 10 days after Katrina reached New Orleans, Congress had approved $62.3 billion in emergency funding.

Now, let’s talk about federal aid for victims of Hurricane Sandy.

Sandy made landfall near Atlantic City on Oct. 29, ultimately damaging more than 70,000 homes and businesses in New Jersey alone, The Star-Ledger has reported. Parts of New York and Connecticut suffered extensive damage as well.

On Dec. 7, President Obama requested $60.4 billion in emergency appropriations to assist the states affected by Sandy. In a 62-32 vote on Dec. 28, the Democrat-controlled Senate approved that amount.

But around the same time when the GOP-led House passed legislation dealing with the so-called ""fiscal cliff,"" Speaker John Boehner canceled a vote on the disaster relief Tuesday night.

Boehner is expected to schedule a vote tomorrow on $9 billion for the National Flood Insurance Program and another vote on Jan. 15 for the remaining $51 billion in the aid package.

Our ruling

In a Dec. 27 speech on the Senate floor, Menendez said that ""10 days after Hurricane Katrina, this chamber passed two separate bills amounting to $60 billion. It has been nearly two months since we had Superstorm Sandy, and nothing has passed.""

The senator’s claim is on the mark. Within 10 days after Hurricane Katrina made landfall in Louisiana in August 2005, Congress approved two separate bills providing a total of $62.3 billion in disaster relief funding.

The Senate on Dec. 28 approved a $60.4 billion aid package for Hurricane Sandy, but the House has delayed action on the emergency funding.

John Boehner says half the wealthiest Americans are small business owners
","
As President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner dickered over how to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, the issue of who might pay more in taxes was a persistent stumbling block.

The White House said there could be no deficit deal unless Republicans agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest households and proposed increasing rates on incomes greater than $250,000 a year for married couples ($200,000 for individuals).

Republicans wanted to focus the talks on spending and entitlements.

Ultimately a deal brokered by Vice President Joe Biden and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, was approved. It allowed rates to rise on incomes above $450,000 for married couples.

But during the negotiating, Boehner balked at increasing the maximum 35 percent tax rate on high-income taxpayers at all because of the effects for small business.

""The problem with raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans is that more than half of them are small business owners,"" Boehner said in a news conference. ""Raising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs that everyone says they want.""

PolitiFact has examined a similar claim Boehner made about small business owners before, and rated it False. FactCheck.org also has looked at the issue, calling it ""an incorrect talking point"" and a ""bogus claim."" But we wondered about current figures behind the claim, and several readers asked about its accuracy.

We asked Boehner's office how he backed up the statement. His staff said the tax increases would hit half of all small business income, and they pointed us to a January 2012 report from the President’s Council on Jobs and Competitiveness.

The council's report states: ""About half of business income now accrues to pass-through entities such as S corporations and partnerships; although the income of such pass-through entities is subject to tax at the individual level, it is excluded from the corporate tax.""

In other words, Boehner's staff said, many small businesses file their taxes as individuals, not corporations, and 53 percent of all business income is taxed through the individual code.

Boehner's staff also cited a report by the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation in Congress which said the tax hikes would affect roughly 940,000 small business owners. It, too, found that 53 percent of business income would be reported on tax returns in the top brackets on which Obama would raise taxes.

That does show that some small business owners would see taxes go up. But it falls short of supporting Boehner's statement.

While the JCT report found that 53 percent of business income would be reported in the top two tax brackets, that is not at all the same as saying that half of the earners are being taxed at that rate.

In fact, the JCT estimated that just 3.5 percent of taxpayers with business income in 2013 would fall in the tax brackets that would rise under Obama's proposal.

And the JCT said its figures ""do not imply that all of the income is from entities that might be considered 'small.' For example, in 2005, 12,862 S corporations and 6,658 partnerships had receipts of more than $50 million.""

S corporations and partnerships are ""pass-through"" businesses in which profits pass from the business to individual shareholders for tax purposes. They include sole proprietorships and such partnerships as big law firms and financial funds. Goldman Sachs was classified as a partnership before it went public in 1999.

So what is a small business?

The Office of Tax Analysis at the U.S. Treasury Department issued a study in 2011 that recognized the need for a clear definition. The authors acknowledge that defining a small business is a matter of setting some subjective parameters.

The ones they set include a limit of $10 million in income or deductions to be counted as ""small,"" and a minimum labor deduction of $10,000 to distinguish businesses that don’t have any employees.

Other tests they applied excluded businesses on the very low end of the scale, such as those with $4,600 or less net annual income. They defined an ""owner"" as someone who gets at least one-fourth of income from a small business.

Not surprisingly, by narrowing the definition, far fewer tax filers qualified as small businesses.
The analysis found that: 
Boehner's statement was: ""The problem with raising tax rates on the wealthiest Americans is that more than half of them are small business owners.""

That is wrong on two points -- the ""half"" and the ""small business owners.""

Of the business income reported on tax returns, half of it would have been taxed at the top two rates, the Joint Committee on Taxation found. But that doesn’t mean half of the earners are paying those rates.

And it’s incorrect to call small business owners and millionaires who would see a tax increase one and the same. For top earners who report business income, it is often just a fraction of their total income. They are not the folks operating small manufacturing plants or neighborhood pizza parlors. In fact, only 0.5 percent of small businesses make that kind of money.

More often, small businesses are small in every sense -- most have incomes of less than $50,000 and almost all have profits of less than $1 million -- and they wouldn’t be affected by the millionaires tax.

AIG says it has repaid the government, plus profit
","New Year’s Day football watchers got a heavy dose of rah, rah from AIG, the big insurance company that was bailed out by federal taxpayers.

An ad called ""Thank You, America"" featured scenes from Hurricane Sandy, tornado-ravaged Joplin, Mo., and the World Trade Center — disasters the company insured — with the message: We paid you back.

AIG has repaid ""everything, plus a profit of more than $22 billion,"" an employee in the ad says.

Text on the screen soon flashes: ""$205 billion, paid to America from AIG.""

You’ll see the ad over the next two weeks as you watch sports, news and the Golden Globes. We thought you might wonder: Is that true? Did the company pay back its loans plus a profit?

Final stock sale

Back in 2008, AIG was in deep trouble. AIG Financial Products had invested heavily in complicated financial instruments called credit default swaps. As financial journalist Michael Lewis put it in his book The Big Short, AIG became, essentially, the world’s biggest owner of subprime mortgage bonds.

When those bonds turned out to be dangerously hollow, the financial world unraveled. Bear Stearns failed, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac collapsed and Lehman Bros. went bankrupt. After markets reacted badly to the Lehman bankruptcy, the Federal Reserve and Treasury Department decided to rescue AIG.

Offering $182 billion to stabilize the company, the federal government became its largest stockholder. Two years ago, the Treasury held 92 percent of AIG’s common stock — more than a billion and a half shares.

The company made significant changes, including slashing bad investments made by AIG Financial Products, the division that oversaw the controversial credit default swaps.

The federal government gradually sold its stake. Last month, the Treasury sold the last shares for an overall ""positive return"" of $22.7 billion. Andrew Ross Sorkin, a New York Times columnist and author of Too Big to Fail, called AIG the ""turnaround of the year.""

Still, the New York Times editorial board and critics of the bailout point out that amount doesn’t take into account tax breaks the company got as part of the deal. Former members of an oversight panel said in March that a special tax exemption offered by the Treasury in 2008 amounted to a ""stealth bailout.""

It allowed AIG to count net operating losses against future tax bills, which ""some estimate has contributed to $17.7 billion in profits for the company,"" according to the group of former oversight panelists, including chair Elizabeth Warren, now a Democratic senator from Massachusetts.

So, have the government’s loans been repaid, with a ""positive return"" of $22 billion for taxpayers? Yes. Was the entire U.S. bailout of AIG, including special tax provisions, that profitable? No.

Our ruling

AIG says it honored its commitment to repay the government, plus a profit of more than $22 billion.

It's true that the government has recouped the $182 billion it loaned AIG, plus $22.7 billion. Still, critics have a point that a special tax provision granted to aid the struggling company substantially offsets that ""profit.""

4 of 5 Milwaukee Public Schools students behind in reading, math, state school superintendent candidate says
","
Tagging himself a common-sense conservative reformer, Wisconsin state Rep. Don Pridemore, R-Erin, aims to unseat first-term state Superintendent of Public Instruction Tony Evers in the April 2013 election.

In announcing his run Dec. 3, 2012, Pridemore criticized school performance, taking particular aim at the district in Wisconsin’s largest city, Milwaukee Public Schools.

The eight-year suburban lawmaker said ""86 percent of MPS students are behind in reading and 80 percent are behind in math.""

Milwaukee Public Schools is a popular target.

But are the vast majority of its students lagging in reading and math?

Pridemore’s evidence

When we asked Pridemore to back up his claim, he cited an Oct. 24, 2012, article in the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. The article reported on recalculations done by the Department of Public Instruction, the agency Evers heads, on a statewide student tests.

The recalculations were done on 2011 scores for the Wisconsin Knowledge and Concepts Examination, which is given each fall. As the Journal Sentinel explained, DPI raised expectations for performance to match those of a respected national exam.

The recalibration meant that essentially overnight, there was a large increase in the number of students who were rated as non-proficient -- even though their performance on the test didn’t change.

Statewide, under the old standard for scoring the 2011 WKCE tests, 18 percent of students failed to score as proficient or advanced in reading. But the figure rose to 64 percent under the new standard.

In math, the non-proficiency figure rose from 22 percent under the old standard to 52 percent under the new.

Milwaukee Public Schools students fared worse.

Under the old standard, nearly 42 percent of MPS students were scored as not proficient in reading. But under the new standard, the figure climbed to 86 percent.

In math, nearly 41 percent of MPS students were rated as not proficient under the old standard. That rose to just over 80 percent under the new standard.

Milwaukee Public Schools spokesman Tony Tagliavia acknowledged the accuracy of the figures, but pointed out that the percentages of students in Milwaukee voucher, or choice, schools rated as not proficient were even higher in reading (90 percent) and math (88 percent). He said it was important to cite the performance of private schools that get public funding since they are ""pitched as the solution to issues with MPS.""

But we’re not testing a claim about voucher schools -- we’re testing Pridemore’s claim about MPS students’ proficiency in reading and math.

Our rating

Pridemore said that among Milwaukee Public Schools students, ""86 percent are behind in reading and 80 percent are behind in math.""

We would note that the figures are as high as they not because of a change in student performance, but a change in the way the state scores a test.

Nevertheless, Pridemore states the figures accurately and we rate his statement True.",/factchecks/2013/jan/02/don-pridemore/4-5-milwaukee-public-schools-students-behind-readi/

NAMI Ohio leader Terry Russell says people with mental illnesses die 25 years earlier, on average, than those without
","
One of the questions about the state budget proposal that Gov. John Kasich is expected to announce in February is whether the state will follow through with the Affordable Care Act's expansion of Medicaid coverage.
The federal health care law would expand coverage to people with incomes up to 138 percent of the poverty level -- a provision which was made optional under the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that otherwise upheld the law.

A bipartisan group of 85 health coverage organizations has written to the governor saying anything less than the full 138 percent would cause people to drop or skip coverage, endangering their health.

Terry Russell, executive director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness of Ohio, told Gongwer News Service that mentally ill Ohioans struggle to stay employed, and that local mental health agencies have marginal resources to help.

""The sad statistic that haunts us every day is that individuals with mental illnesses die an average of 25 years earlier than those without a mental illness,"" he said. ""Sixty percent of these premature deaths are the result of preventable and treatable diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer and infections.""

PolitiFact Ohio checked into his claim about 25 years, and quickly found his statement was right on the money.

A study published in 2006 by the National Association of State Mental Health Program Directors that was the focus of wide attention and concern in the mental health community looked at data from 16 states, including Ohio.

It found that, on average, people with severe mental illness die 25 years earlier than the general population.

The figure for Ohio was actually worse. People with severe mental illness die 32 years earlier.

Calling it ""a serious public health problem for the people served by our state mental health systems,"" the study said about 60 percent of premature deaths are due to conditions such as cardiovascular, pulmonary and infectious diseases.

A number of factors contribute to risk, the study said, including modifiable factors like obesity, poor nutrition and alcohol and tobacco use. People with severe mental illness have poorer access to appropriate health care, and may be additionally vulnerable because of higher rates of homelessness, victimization, unemployment and poverty.

Among its recommendations, the report called for better access to physical health care for people with serious mental illnesses to fight what it called an ""epidemic of premature death and its contributing causes.""

Russell said that people with mental illnesses, on average, die 25 years earlier than those without a mental illness. He accurately cited findings of a major study on the issue. And in Ohio, the average is actually greater than 25 years.

Kingston makes issue of Connecticut's gun control laws
","
Even ardent gun rights supporters are willing to talk gun control in the wake of the deadly shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary in Newtown, Conn.

During a Dec. 18 grilling by MSNBC anchor Thomas Roberts, U.S. Rep. Jack Kingston said gun control should be ""up for discussion"" alongside violent video games and mental health. The Savannah Republican was endorsed by the National Rifle Association in 2012 and received an A+ grade from the group.

Changing gun laws may not be the answer, though.  

""Connecticut has the fifth toughest gun control laws in the country, including an assault weapons ban that bans 35 different weapons,"" Kingston said.

A Kingston spokesman did not reply to our request for more information, so we searched for state-by-state comparisons of gun control laws and reviewed Connecticut’s assault weapons statute.

The term ""assault weapon"" is controversial. Various state laws use the phrase, although the National Rifle Association argues that gun control advocates created it to ""trick the public into believing that ‘assault weapons’ were fully-automatic machine guns used by the military,"" its website says.  

There’s no formal definition for what counts as an assault weapon. Laws describing them vary. In general, the term refers to a semi-automatic firearm that resembles a fully automatic one or those used by militaries.

Connecticut law generally bans the sale, transfer or possession of assault weapons. State statute defines them in two ways:
  

Connecticut’s law lists 37 guns, not 35, so Kingston’s not far from the mark. Technically speaking, the statute is written so that firearms outside the list can be prohibited, but this is a minor problem.

What about Connecticut’s ranking?

The Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence uses a point system to rank states based on whether their statutes met the group’s standards on curbing firearm trafficking; background checks; child safety requirements and other factors.

Connecticut’s laws were ranked the fifth strongest in the nation in 2011, the group’s most recent list. It was bested by California, New Jersey, Massachusetts and New York. Georgia tied for 22nd.

The nutmeg state scored well consistently. We checked the rankings back to 2007 and found it made the top five each time.

Still, Connecticut’s 58 points lagged well behind first place California, which earned 81 points.

The state’s assault weapons ban was one reason why. It earned only three out of a possible 10 points because magazines that carry more than 10 rounds remain legal there. Also, the Brady Campaign prefers a different definition for an assault weapon.  

""While it’s the state with the fifth strongest gun laws, obviously, at 58 points out of 100, there’s a lot more the state can do,"" said Brian Malte, a spokesman for the group.

We found that groups that push for tougher gun laws consistently give Connecticut high marks.

For instance, the San Francisco-based Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence ranked Connecticut fourth in its 2012 report, and fifth in 2010. It assigns points to each state based on 29 aspects of gun law, including the sale and transfer of firearms, owner responsibilities, and rules on their handling in public places.

The center Georgia ranked 24th in 2012.

And Mayors Against Illegal Guns, which boasts membership of more than 700 mayors, including Atlanta’s Kasim Reed, issued a 2010 report that compared states based on whether they enacted 10 key types of gun laws.

Connecticut had put nine of the 10 types in place. Only New York and New Jersey received a 10 out of 10. Georgia had enacted two.

Our conclusion:

Kingston is right on this one. Connecticut consistently ranks high in lists of states with stringent gun laws, and literally ranked fifth in recent rankings by the Brady Campaign and the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence.

Furthermore, he’s pretty close on the number of assault weapons banned in Connecticut law.

David Dewhurst says under Texas law, it takes six years to close a failing school
","
A headline-grabbing plan to help students transfer isn’t the only way Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst wants to handle ""unacceptable"" schools in Texas.

""Currently under Texas law, it takes six years to close down a failing school. That’s nuts. I’m going to move for legislation to make it two years,"" Dewhurst told the Dallas regional chamber of commerce Nov. 19, 2012, according to a news story from KERA-TV, Channel 13 in Dallas.

Well, ""nuts"" is an opinion, but ""six years"" is something we can check.

We asked Dewhurst and spokesman Matt Hirsch for details and support for the claim but did not hear back.

Dewhurst repeated his call to ""shorten that time period"" and also made it clear he was referring to academic failure during a Dec. 19, 2012, news conference announcing a proposal to give businesses tax credits for donations to a scholarship fund helping students switch schools.

Texas Education Agency spokeswoman Debbie Ratcliffe told us by email that it takes six years of ""unacceptable"" academic ratings before the Texas schools commissioner is absolutely required to shut down a campus.

But by law, Ratcliffe said, the commissioner can close a school for purely academic reasons after three years. That’s ""two years of academically unacceptable ratings plus one year in which the school fails to successfully implement a reconstitution plan,"" she said.

We reviewed the Texas education code and found that it clearly states that ""after a campus has been identified as unacceptable for two consecutive school years, the commissioner shall order the reconstitution of the campus."" That process, Ratcliffe said, typically includes replacing faculty members.

If the commissioner is not satisfied with the progress under the reconstitution plan, he or she can order ""repurposing"" of the campus, install new management or order it closed. So, the commissioner could close a school after three years.

If the school receives three consecutive ""unacceptables"" after reconstitution, the law says, the commissioner ""shall order"" the campus be repurposed, be put under ""alternative management"" or closed. The only exception is that if it appears the school will improve its rating in the next year, the commissioner can grant another year’s leeway -- bringing the maximum time to six years.

Schools can be -- and have been -- closed more quickly for ""financial, health and safety or other reasons,"" Ratcliffe said. ""Some of those had academic problems; just not five or six years of low ratings.""

Charter schools -- public schools under private management -- can also be shut down more quickly for violating a charter contract, Ratcliffe said, which can involve academics.

Only three public schools have been closed for purely academic reasons since the current accountability system began in 1993, Ratcliffe said. Each of those cases took five to six years.

Johnston High School in the Austin school district and Sam Houston High School in the Houston district were ordered to close in 2008, after five years at ""unacceptable"" for Johnston, according to a June 5, 2008, Austin American-Statesman news story, and six years of ""unacceptable"" ratings at Sam Houston, according to a June 6, 2008, Houston Chronicle news story.

Pearce Middle School, also in the Austin district, was ordered to close in 2009 after five years of ""unacceptable"" ratings, according to a July 9, 2009, Statesman news story.

Agency data Ratcliffe sent us for 2004 through 2011 showed that of the 223 schools ordered to reconstitute, 205 achieved sufficient improvements to get out of the danger zone before an ultimate sanction was triggered. Fourteen schools had posted more than two consecutive ""unacceptable"" years but hadn’t yet reached five.

Ratcliffe said that although a new accountability system is in the works, the six-year requirement won’t change unless the state law governing closure is modified by the Legislature -- for example, if Dewhurst’s two-year suggestion were adopted.

 Our ruling

Dewhurst said it takes six years under Texas law to close a failing school. That’s the maximum, and it’s usually taken nearly that long, but by law a commissioner can order closure after just three years. We rate Dewhurst’s statement as False.",/factchecks/2013/jan/01/david-dewhurst/david-dewhurst-says-under-texas-law-it-takes-six-y/

Anti-poverty spending could give poor $22,000 checks, Rep. Paul Ryan says
","
In a speech shortly after the presidential election, Republican vice-presidential contender Paul Ryan decried what he called the government’s ineffective approach to fighting poverty, saying spending alone isn’t the answer.

""Just last year, total federal and state spending on means-tested programs came to over $1 trillion,"" the Wisconsin congressman and House Budget Committee chairman said Dec. 4, 2012, referring to programs that have eligibility based on income.

""What does that mean in practical terms? For that amount of money, you could give every single poor American a check for $22,000 -- every man, woman and child.""

Really?

Let’s check Ryan’s math.

Ryan’s evidence

To begin with, a little background: 
-- Ryan made his indictment at a time when poverty is at one of its highest rates in decades. In 2011, 46.2 million people, or 15 percent of the U.S. population, lived in poverty. 
-- For 2012, the income levels to be eligible for certain anti-poverty programs was $11,170 for a single person and $23,050 for a family of four. 
-- More than half of Americans -- 51 percent, according to an October 2012 Rasmussen poll -- think the government spends too much fighting poverty. That’s up from 38 percent in an April 2011 Rasmussen survey. 
As for the numbers in Ryan’s speech, it turns out he had used them before -- on the campaign trail less than a month before the election.

Here’s the evidence Ryan spokesman Kevin Seifert provided us to back the two numbers.

How much was spent: Some $1.03 trillion was spent on means-tested programs for the poor in 2011, Republicans on the Senate Budget Committee said in October 2012.

Most of that amount -- $746 billion -- was federal spending, based on a detailed memo by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, with the committee itself estimating that states picked up the remainder of the $1 trillion.

But it’s not as though all of that money was being given to people in poverty as cash or food. The largest category was for health care, primarily through Medicaid.

How many in poverty: Ryan cited census data, noting as we did earlier that 46.2 million people lived in poverty in 2011.

From there, Ryan takes the $1.03 trillion and divides it by 46.2 million people living in poverty. The result, he says, is each poor person could have been written a check for $22,000.

The math itself is accurate, and there’s no dispute about the number of people in poverty.

But let’s go to some experts for a closer look.
 
The conservative Heritage Foundation calculates the cost of means-tested federal and state spending on welfare programs in 2011 as $927 billion, with half the amount going to health care.

Michael Tanner, a senior fellow with the libertarian Cato Institute, puts the 2011 anti-poverty spending figure at $952 billion -- although he counted local government spending as well as money spent by the federal and state governments. That amounts to $20,610 for every poor person, Tanner wrote.

So, both groups give support to Ryan’s claim, although their spending figures are somewhat lower than Ryan’s claim of $1 trillion.

The liberal Center for Economic and Policy Research says that even if the $1 trillion is accurate, it is spent on ""a population that is more than twice the size"" of the 46 million people living in poverty. That’s because two of the major programs, Medicaid and the earned income tax credit, have income eligibility limits above the poverty line.

Moreover, some of the $1 trillion, the center said, is paid to school districts and other institutions to help educate the poor -- the poor themselves don’t get the money.

LaDonna Pavetti, a family income support researcher at the liberal Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said of Ryan’s claim: ""It’s not so much the numbers as what he does with them.""

Noting that the single largest portion of spending cited by Ryan is on health care, Pavetti pointed out that the largest Medicaid expenditures are made on people who live in nursing homes and other institutions -- they, by definition, are not included in the number of people living in poverty.

And the list of programs Ryan includes in his $1 trillion in spending ""is sort of anything and everything that is targeted to low-income people,"" Pavetti said. That includes money that aids schools and low-income communities but do not directly benefit the poor, she said.

Our rating

Ryan said ""over $1 trillion"" was spent on anti-poverty programs in 2011, enough to ""give every single poor American a check for $22,000.""

As a sweeping statement, Ryan’s claim is partially accurate, in that roughly $1 trillion was spent on means-tested programs, and if you divided that by the number of people living in poverty, it would amount to roughly $22,000 per person.

But Ryan mixes apples and oranges, in that the $1 trillion is actually spent on far more people than the 46 million counted as living in poverty. Moreover, much of the money goes to institutions, such as nursing homes and schools, and not directly into the pockets of the poor.

Fact-checking claim on Electoral College, Los Angeles County and 43 states
","A Facebook post claims that getting rid of the Electoral College would give a single county in California more say in the election of the president than 43 states. ""Abolishing the Electoral College would make Los Angeles County stronger than 43 states,"" said the Nov. 11 Facebook post that’s been shared more than 18,000 times. The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.)  The post, taken literally, makes no sense, said James A. Gardner, an election law expert at the University at Buffalo School of Law. ""If the Electoral College were abolished, presumably the president would be elected by nationwide majority vote,"" Gardner said. In such a system, all groups of people ""would have precisely identical influence on the outcome of the election since every vote would count equally in the final tally,"" he said. A voter in Los Angeles County would have exactly the same input into the presidential election as would a voter in rural Wyoming if a national popular vote were used to elect the president, said Robert Speel, a political science associate professor at Penn State Erie, The Behrend College. Voters on Election Day choose who they want as president, yet the final vote comes later through the Electoral College, which consists of 538 electors. (The candidate who reaches 270 Electoral College votes wins.) The number of electors a state gets equals the combined number of members a state has in the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Each state has two senators, and the number of representatives for each state varies depending on the state’s population. States with more people have more representatives. (Though not a state, the District of Columbia is allocated three electors due to a constitutional amendment. U.S. territories, like Puerto Rico, do not get electors and cannot vote in the general election.) Eliminating the Electoral College (and not creating a new system in its place) would mean that the president is elected based on the popular vote -- that is, who gets the most votes on Election Day.  Supporters of the Electoral College argue that keeping it requires candidates to get votes from all parts of the country, including less populated areas. Opponents say that it actually makes candidates focus only on swing states -- states where the margin is close enough that either party has a chance of winning. The Facebook post appears to suggest that since Los Angeles County has a lot of people — an estimated 10.1 million as of July 2019 — it will outweigh the voice of 43 other states. The post doesn’t specify which states, nor does it make clear if it means the county will be stronger than the 43 states combined or compared to each. U.S. Census Bureau population estimates show that 41 states, the District of Columbia, and Puerto Rico each had fewer people than did Los Angeles County. (Perhaps whoever created the Facebook post added the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico to arrive at ""43 states."")  One way to read the post is to say that Los Angeles County’s influence under a direct popular vote would outweigh the combination of all 43 states. But that’s wrong. The 43 states’ collective population — about 163.7 million — is about 16 times that of Los Angeles County. In a direct popular vote system, candidates might adjust their campaign strategy to appear in major media markets like Los Angeles, because that would be the most efficient use of campaign resources.  ""So maybe the author is trying inartfully to say this,"" Gardner said of the Facebook post.  But it’s uncertain whether candidates would even make that change. It could also be that candidates avoid places like Los Angeles because they are reliably Democratic and focus instead on winning swing regions, Gardner said. Under the Electoral College system, candidates spend almost all of their general election campaign time in urban and suburban areas in 10 to 12 battleground states, Speel said. In a popular vote system, they would likely stick to those regions but in a greater variety of states, he said. ""Presidential candidates are not going to campaign for the general election in rural areas no matter what system is used, simply because there aren't enough votes there,"" Speel said. A Facebook post said, ""Abolishing the Electoral College would make Los Angeles County stronger than 43 states."" With a popular vote system in place of the Electoral College, experts said every individual voter will have the same power. A change from one system to another could alter campaigning practices, but that doesn’t necessarily mean one vote in an urban area counts more than one vote in a rural area.

No, Trump didn’t donate his airline to bring troops home in the 1990s
","A viral Facebook post depicts President Donald Trump as a generous airline owner who donated his planes to transport American soldiers home from Saudi Arabia in 1991. But the details don’t square with what happened. The post features a letter purportedly written by a man named Ron Knouse. He describes how he and other soldiers had to wait four days for buses to the airport because there was a shortage of planes at the end of Operation Desert Storm.   ""Finally, the buses came and took the young man to the airport.

""This needs to go viral. He’s done so many good things you never hear about."" The post was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Donald Trump did operate an airline at one time. But the details of the letter are inaccurate. Trump did not own Tower Air, and we found no evidence he assisted in the transport of military personnel from Saudi Arabia. Beyond that, Trump’s airline — Trump Shuttle — was being controlled by a consortium of banks, not Trump, when the United States military chartered flights from the airline for personnel transport. That was for flights within the United States, not from Saudi Arabia. A different story about a Trump plane transporting 200 marines from North Carolina to Florida after Operation Desert Storm in 1991 emerged when conservative talk radio host Sean Hannity aired a now-deleted segment about it in May 2016, during Trump’s presidential campaign. In that version, about 200 Marines took two trips on a Trump-owned plane from North Carolina to Florida after a logistics error left them stranded.  While Trump’s 2016 presidential campaign allegedly confirmed the story, details show that he was not personally involved in transporting any American troops. Trump ran the airline for a short time. In May 1989, he purchased Eastern Airlines for $365 million, renaming it Trump Shuttle. The airline operated short flights in the northeastern United States using a fleet of Boeing 727 airliners. A 2016 fact-check by the Washington Post reported that while some Trump Shuttle planes did transport military personnel around the country in the early 1990s, it was the U.S. military that chartered those flights, not Trump personally. Retired Lt. Gen. Vernon Kondra, who was in charge of all military airlift operations at the time, told the newspaper his notes indicated several references to a 1990-91 contract for Trump Shuttle to carry personnel across the country. He said it would have made little sense if Trump personally arranged the flights and said he was ""certainly not aware"" of him being involved. Trump wasn’t in a position to donate plane rides, anyway. NYC Aviation reported that he had defaulted on his loan in September 1990, and control of the airline went back to the banks until it was sold to US Air. US Air agreed in late 1991 to operate the airline with an option to buy it outright after five years. By April 1992, Trump Shuttle had ceased to exist when it was merged into a new corporation, Shuttle, Inc., which began operating as the USAir Shuttle. Trump’s name does not appear anywhere in the nearly 20-year history of Tower Air, which is mentioned as being owned by Trump in the Facebook post. The airline contracted with the Department of Defense to transport soldiers on charter flights in the early 1990s and was founded by Zev Melamid, Mordechi Gill, Morris Nachtomi and Sam Fondlier in 1982, according to Airline History records.  When Tower Air filed for bankruptcy in May 2000, Nachtomi was listed as its CEO.  To summarize our findings, Trump Shuttle planes were contracted by the U.S. military to transport personnel around the country while the airline was in the process of being sold; it was not under Trump’s control at the time. Trump was not affiliated with Tower Air, which contracted with the Department of Defense in the 1990s to transport soldiers stationed overseas.

Mike Pence lacks evidence in claiming Soleimani helped 9/11 terrorists
","In a series of tweets justifying the U.S. killing of Qassem Soleimani, Vice President Mike Pence said that among the Iranian military leader’s ""worst atrocities"" was helping 9/11 terrorists. Soleimani ""assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States,"" Pence tweeted Jan. 3. The U.S. Defense Department on Jan. 2 announced it had killed Soleimani, who commanded the Quds Force in Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The Trump administration said the killing was a defensive action and that Soleimani was developing plans to attack American diplomats and troops in Iraq and the region. PolitiFact decided to take a closer look at Pence’s claim that Soleimani assisted the men who carried out the terrorist attacks on 9/11. There’s no evidence to support his statement, and his press secretary did not provide information that directly tied Soleimani to the travel of the 9/11 terrorists. The 9/11 terrorist attacks were carried out by 19 men who hijacked four commercial airplanes, deliberately crashing two planes against the World Trade Center towers, flying another plane into the Pentagon, and the fourth crashing into a field in Pennsylvania. The attacks killed nearly 3,000 people and were orchestrated by the al-Qaida terrorist group based in Afghanistan. The attackers traveled to Afghanistan for training. The 19 hijackers included 15 from Saudi Arabia, two from the United Arab Emirates, one from Lebanon, and one from Egypt. The 9/11 Commission Report, published in 2004, provided a comprehensive account of the 9/11 terrorist attacks, the events and circumstances leading to the attacks, and recommendations to prevent other attacks. Soleimani is not named anywhere in the report. A section of the report said Iranian officials had been willing to facilitate the travel of al-Qaida members through Iran, on their way to and from Afghanistan, telling Iranian border inspectors not to stamp the passports of those travelers. (Iran and Afghanistan share a border.) The report said that Saudi ""muscle"" operatives traveled into or out of Iran between October 2000 and February 2001. ""Muscle"" operatives were hijackers who would storm cockpits and control passengers. But the report also said it found no evidence that Iran was aware of the planning for what later became the 9/11 attack. ""At the time of their travel through Iran, the al-Qaida operatives themselves were probably not aware of the specific details of their future operation,"" the report said. So while the report mentions Iranian officials’ willingness to facilitate the travel of al-Qaida members, it doesn’t implicate Soleimani. Philip Zelikow, executive director of the 9/11 Commission Report, told PolitiFact that the report did not directly tie Soleimani to assisting the travel of the terrorists and that he was not aware of any other information that would tie Soleimani to their travel.      Two other experts shared the view of a lacking Soleimani connection: James Gelvin, a professor of modern Middle East history at UCLA, and Hooshang Amirahmadi, a distinguished service professor at Rutgers University with expertise in United States-Iran relations. What is Pence’s defense? Pence spokeswoman Katie Waldman pointed out the Trump administration’s April 2019 stated intention to designate the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a foreign terrorist organization. The administration in a fact-sheet said the U.S. Treasury Department in 2016 sanctioned three senior al-Qaida operatives in Iran, and that Iran had knowingly permitted those operatives, including several of the 9/11 hijackers, to transit Iran on their way to Afghanistan. But that fact-sheet does not mention Soleimani. Pence’s tweet said Soleimani assisted ""10 of the 12 terrorists,"" and Twitter users pointed out that there were 19 terrorists on 9/11. Waldman tweeted, ""For those asking: 12 of the 19 transited through Afghanistan. 10 of those 12 were assisted by Soleimani."" Her tweet did not provide any additional information or links to evidence to support Pence’s claim. Pence said that Soleimani ""assisted in the clandestine travel to Afghanistan of 10 of the 12 terrorists who carried out the September 11 terrorist attacks in the United States."" The 9/11 Commission Report said that Iran facilitated travel for al-Qaida members who would carry out the 9/11 attacks. But the report also found no evidence that Iran knew of the plans for the attacks. The report also does not mention Soleimani. We found no evidence that Soleimani was involved with the travel of terrorists from Iran to Afghanistan.

Nikki Haley’s Pants on Fire claim that top Democrats are mourning Soleimani
","Nikki Haley, President Donald Trump’s former ambassador to the United Nations, baselessly accused leading Democrats of mourning the death of Iran’s Qassem Soleimani. In an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News Jan. 6, Haley praised Trump’s actions to take out Soleimani with a drone strike of his vehicle near the airport outside Baghdad. While the world knows that he was ""evil,"" Haley said, she accused top Democrats of grieving his loss. ""You don’t see anyone standing up for Iran,"" Haley said. ""You are not hearing any of the Gulf members, you are not hearing China, you are not hearing Russia. The only ones that are mourning the loss of Soleimani are our Democrat leadership and our Democrat presidential candidates."" Haley proceeded to tweet out her statement. “The only ones mourning the loss of Soleimani are our Democrat leadership and Democrat Presidential candidates.” pic.twitter.com/IZJJqpxkBE But Haley is wrong in counting top Democrats among the mourners of Soleimani.  RELATED FACT-CHECK: Haley wrongly says Congress had no input on Iran nuclear deal The five Democrats who have qualified so far for the Jan. 14 debate in Iowa — Joe Biden, Pete Buttigieg, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Amy Klobuchar — all expressed concern about the potential for Trump’s strike on Soleimani to escalate tensions and prompt a rush for war. However, four of the five prefaced their comments by saying that Soleimani was a dangerous man with blood on his hands. None had anything close to praise for him or sympathy for his death. Here are some of the statements by these Democrats:  Biden: In a written statement, the former vice president said that ""no American will mourn Qassem Soleimani’s passing."" He added that Soleimani deserved to be brought to justice and ""supported terror and sowed chaos.""  Biden said Trump owes Americans an explanation of his strategy and how he plans to keep troops safe. ""I hope the administration has thought through the second- and third-order consequences of the paths they have chosen,"" Biden wrote. Later, on Jan. 3, Biden made a similar statement, criticizing Soleimani as the ""architect of the slaughter of countless lives in the region"" and stating that ""no American mourns his passing."" He said Americans don’t want another war in the Middle East and that Trump shouldn’t take us to war without congressional approval. Warren: The Massachusetts senator’s message evolved in the days after the airstrike. But nothing she wrote could be considered an expression of ""mourning."" In her initial tweet, she explicitly called Soleimani ""a murderer, responsible for the deaths of thousands, including hundreds of Americans."" She went on to call Trump’s action ""reckless"" and something that ""escalates the situation with Iran and increases the likelihood of more deaths and new Middle East conflict."" In a second tweet, she didn’t repeat the preface criticizing Soleimani, nor did she in comments to CNN’s Jake Tapper. Instead, she focused on criticizing Trump for his handling of policy toward Iran. In these later statements, Warren said nothing positive about Soleimani. Buttigieg: In a statement, the former South Bend, Ind., mayor said that Soleimani was a threat who ""masterminded threats and attacks on Americans and our allies, leading to hundreds of deaths.""  In addition, in Iowa, Buttigieg said Soleimani has ""blood on his hands"" and that ""taking out a bad guy is not a good idea unless you are ready for what comes next."" Buttigieg called for a deliberative approach that includes working with Congress and U.S. allies and said we must prepare for the potential of escalation. Buttigieg tweeted that Trump owes American troops a strategy and should give Americans answers.  Klobuchar: In her statement after the airstrike, the Minnesota senator criticized the ""timing, manner, and potential consequences of the administration’s actions."" But she prefaced this by saying that ""Qassem Soleimani was responsible for directing Iran’s destabilizing actions in Iraq, Syria, and throughout the Middle East, including attacks against U.S. forces."" Sanders: The Vermont senator’s written statement had nothing positive to say about Soleimani, focusing instead on how the ""assassination"" by Trump was a ""dangerous escalation"" that ""brings us closer to another disastrous war in the Middle East that could cost countless lives and trillions more dollars."" He said much the same in a streamed campaign event he tweeted out, briefly mentioning Soleimani but neither explicitly criticizing or praising him. In an interview with CNN, Sanders called him a ""bad news guy"" but focused more on his opposition to going to war with Iran. Several other Democratic presidential candidates also made a point of criticizing Soleimani.  Sen. Cory Booker, D-N.J., said on MSNBC that ""Soleimani has American blood on his hands."" Sen. Michael Bennet, D-Colo., said in a statement that Soleimani ""has the blood of Americans and our allies on his hands"" and ""there is no mourning his death.""  Businessman Tom Steyer tweeted that Soleimani was ""a terrorist responsible for killing Americans."" And former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg tweeted that Soleimani ""was a murderer with the blood of Americans on his hands."" Top congressional Democrats echoed the critiques offered by the presidential candidates. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., had harsh words for Soleimani while criticizing the Trump administration’s actions, calling the general a ""notorious terrorist"" and saying that ""no one should shed a tear over his death.""  House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., did not dwell on Soleimani in either of two statements released after the operation. She said in her first statement that the airstrike was ""provocative and disproportionate"" and in a later statement that it raised ""urgent questions about the timing, manner and justification"" for the operation. Neither of her statements made any effort to mourn Soleimani.  Other leading Democrats on foreign policy issues, including Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Rep. Eliot L. Engel, D-N.Y., also criticized Soleimani.  A response from Haley’s spokesman included such a broad interpretation of the word ""mourning"" to render its definition meaningless, saying Democrats are ""effectively"" mourning Soleimani by questioning whether the United States is better off after his killing. Haley said the Democratic leadership and presidential candidates ""are mourning the loss of Soleimani."" That’s a complete fabrication. Most of the top congressional Democrats and the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination have gone out of their way to say that Soleimani was a bad actor who is responsible for many deaths, including deaths of Americans. The few top Democrats who didn’t go out of their way to say something along those lines simply ignored him in their statements. Haley’s statement is ridiculous.

$150 billion is high-end estimate for Iranian assets gained after nuclear deal
","Angered by deadly U.S. airstrikes that targeted an Iran-backed militia, dozens of Iraqi Shiite militiamen and their supporters broke into the U.S. Embassy compound in Baghdad on Dec. 31. The next day, a Facebook post referencing former President Barack Obama made this claim: ""Iran will be shooting at our soldiers with bullets, etc., purchased with the $150 billion Obama gave them."" The post misrepresents the Iran nuclear deal from 2015.  The agreement was promoted by Obama. But it included China, France, Germany, Russia, the United Kingdom and the European Union — not just the United States and Iran.   The deal resulted in Iran getting access to some of its own funds — assets that had been frozen — it wasn’t cash given to Iran by the United States. And $150 billion is a high-end estimate and the one with the least evidence to support it. The high-end estimate from the U.S. Treasury Department in 2015 was $56 billion, and outside analysts believed the number could be lower. Per the deal, the United States and other countries lifted the sanctions and the funds were unfrozen after nuclear inspectors verified in January 2016 that Iran was doing enough to curb its nuclear program. (On Jan. 5, in the aftermath of the airstrikes, Iran said it no longer will comply with limits on uranium enrichment provided under the deal.) It’s worth noting that it was not clear what became of the unfrozen funds.  In January 2016, then-Secretary of State John Kerry said he expected that some of the money ultimately would end up with organizations involved in terrorism.  A Facebook post claimed: ""Iran will be shooting at our soldiers with bullets, etc., purchased with the $150 billion Obama gave them."" The 2015 Iran nuclear deal involved multiple nations, not just the United States under Obama, and did not involve the United States giving cash to Iran. It’s also debatable whether Iran ultimately got access to $150 billion of what were its own assets — which had been frozen in retaliation for its pursuit of a nuclear weapon — or whether the amount was much less. What is correct is that largely because of the U.S. involvement, the deal resulted Iran getting access to likely tens of billions of dollars of its own funds, and it’s unclear how they might be spent. For a statement that contains only an element of truth, our ruling is Mostly False.",/factchecks/2020/jan/07/facebook-posts/facebook-claim-wrongly-states-obama-gave-iran-150-/

Biden continues to recast his comments to Obama about bin Laden raid
","Former Vice President Joe Biden has continued to recast what advice he gave President Barack Obama about whether to raid the compound that was the suspected hideaway for Osama bin Laden.  Biden’s latest statement occurred during a brief exchange with Fox News reporter Peter Doocy in Iowa on Jan. 3, following President Donald Trump’s order to kill Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani. Doocy: ""As commander in chief, if you were ever handed a piece of intelligence that said you can stop an imminent attack on Americans but you have to use an airstrike to take out a terror leader, would you pull the trigger?"" Biden: ""Well, we did. Guy’s name was Osama bin Laden."" Doocy: ""Didn’t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden?"" Biden: ""No, I didn’t. I didn’t."" It is a challenge to fact-check what Biden told Obama in advance of the May 2011 raid to kill bin Laden, because their conversations were largely private. However, Biden has made conflicting statements about what he told Obama. In 2012, Biden said he told Obama ""don’t go"" and called for him to take additional steps to confirm bin Laden was at the compound. But in 2015, Biden said he told Obama ""go."" In January 2012 at a Democratic congressional retreat, Biden recounted how Obama asked senior officials whether they should go ahead with the raid. Everyone in the room ""hedged their bet"" except CIA Director Leon Panetta, who said ""go.""  ""Mr. President, my suggestion is, don't go,"" Biden recounted. ""‘We have to do two more things to see if he's there."" (He did not explain what the two additional things were at the time.) (When a reporter asked White House spokesman Jay Carney in 2012 about Biden’s comments stating he was against the raid, Carney said: ""I know that he is speaking accurately."") In May 2012 on NBC’s Meet the Press, Biden said he told Obama ""follow your instincts."" ""I wanted him to take one more day to do one more test to see if he was there,"" Biden said.  Obama’s statement during a debate in 2012 supported the idea that Biden was critical about the raid proposal. Obama said that ""even some in my own party, including my current vice president,"" critiqued the proposed raid. By 2013, Biden started to recast his account of what he told Obama. In January 2013, the New York Times magazine wrote that Biden had advised against the 2011 raid on the house in Pakistan that was suspected to be bin Laden’s hideaway. But the quote by Biden was more vague: ""I remember walking up to his office and saying, ‘Look, follow your instincts, follow your instincts.’""  In 2015, Biden said he did tell Obama privately to go after bin Laden. On Oct. 20, 2015, at an event honoring former Vice President Walter Mondale, Biden said when Obama asked everyone in the room whether he should go forward, only two were definitive: Panetta said ""go"" and Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said ""don’t go.""   Biden recounted that he suggested a third option, though he said it was one ""that I didn’t really think we should do."" Biden said he proposed to take one more pass with an unmanned aerial vehicle to confirm that it was bin Laden at the compound. Then Biden said he told Obama in a private conversation, ""I thought he should go but to follow his own instincts."" That led to multiple news reports showing that Biden had revised his account from 2012 when he said he told Obama ""don’t go."" Days later, CBS journalist Norah O’Donnell asked Biden to clear up the confusion about whether he told Obama to conduct the raid. ""Everything I said was completely accurate. I just never until last Tuesday night told the whole story,"" he said, referring to the Mondale event. Biden said he first told Obama to do another check, and then he told Obama to follow his own instincts:  ""I said, ‘You should do that, and there would be still time to have the raid, but that’s what I would do.""  Biden continued: ""Immediately, we got up, as we always do, and I walked out with the president. We walked up to the Oval. I said, ‘Mr. President, follow your instincts. I know you should do it, but follow your instincts.’ ""  Biden’s 2020 campaign pushed back against criticism that his statements have been inconsistent. The campaign said in a statement that at the outset, Biden advised that the United States should first obtain additional confirmation that bin Laden was at the compound. Biden, the campaign said, never proposed stopping the operation.  Biden’s claim that he told Obama to ""go"" conflicted with other accounts from Obama-era officials in their books. (A Trump campaign spokesman, Zach Parkinson, tweeted many of these passages.) Obama’s Secretary of State Hillary Clinton wrote in ""Hard Choices"" that Biden ""remained skeptical."" Panetta wrote in ""Worthy Fights"" that Biden ""argued that we still did not have enough confidence that bin Laden was in the compound, and he came out firmly in favor of waiting for more information."" Defense Secretary Robert Gates wrote in ""Duty: Memoirs of a Secretary at War"" that he and Biden were the ""two primary skeptics."" ""Biden’s primary concern was the political consequences of failure,"" Gates wrote.   When Doocy asked Biden ""Didn’t you tell President Obama not to go after bin Laden?"" Biden replied ""No, I didn’t. I didn’t."" Biden has created confusion with different accounts about what he told Obama.  In 2012, Biden said he told Obama ""don’t go."" Biden said he wanted Obama to take additional steps to confirm bin Laden was at the compound. Other Obama-era officials confirm that Biden was skeptical of the mission.  In 2015, Biden said that he later told Obama privately, ""I thought he should go, but to follow his own instincts."" Biden’s answer to Doocy is hardly the full story and misses critical context. We rate his statement Mostly False.  ",/factchecks/2020/jan/06/joe-biden/biden-continues-recast-his-comments-obama-about-bi/

Digital visualization of Australia fires misrepresented as satellite image
","As wildfires continue to burn millions of acres of land in Australia, some social media users are misusing a digital visualization to draw attention to the disaster. One image published on Facebook Jan. 5 claims to show a satellite view of Australia provided by a NASA satellite. ""Pray for us please,"" the user wrote alongside the image, which shows bright orange spots where fires are purportedly burning across the continent. The image was flagged as part of Facebook’s efforts to combat false news and misinformation on its News Feed. (Read more about our partnership with Facebook.) Similar versions have been shared thousands of times on both Facebook and Instagram, where some celebrities and public figures have reposted it. The photo isn’t a satellite image of Australia — it’s a digital visualization of fire data. Anthony Hearsey, a Brisbane-based photographer and graphic designer, created the visualization and published it on Instagram Jan. 5. He said in the caption that he created the visualization using nearly eight months of data from NASA’s Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS), which ""distributes near-real-time active fire data.""  ""These are all the areas which have been affected by bushfires,"" Hearsey said in his photo caption. ""Scale is a little exaggerated due to the render’s glow. Also note that not all the areas are still burning."" That’s different than an actual satellite image of Australia, which does not show glow from the fires at a continental view. (It is possible to see smoke from the fires on some closer satellite images.) (NASA) A map from FIRMS that shows the locations of active fires in Australia also helps place Hearsey’s digital visualization in context. (Screenshot from FIRMS) The Facebook posts that portray the visualization as a NASA satellite image are wrong. We rate the claim False.",/factchecks/2020/jan/06/facebook-posts/digital-visualization-australia-fires-misrepresent/
